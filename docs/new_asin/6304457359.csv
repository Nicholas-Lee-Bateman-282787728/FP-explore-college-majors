877566,5,6304457359,"I actually stumbled upon this movie in the TV guide and decided to watch it, only because it had Sean Connery.  It was however given four stars by the critics.  SO I thought how good could it possibly be?  It was  tremendous.  Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors sonce I  saw him in James Bond, The HUnt For REd October, and and The Rock, but The  Man WHo would be king is very close in my opinion to being his best movie.  Not to take anything away from Michael Caine, because he too was fantastic.  The plot was amazing, but in the same time, I could actually see this  happening at the time this movie took place (early 20th century).  John  Huston is such a great director, and this is one of his finest works, and  that's saying a lot, since he directed THe Maltese Falcon and The African  Queen.  The scene where Daniel Dravot falls and his crown also falls from  his head and they both disappear into the valley.  Amazing.  The many  scenes with the monks are also fantastic.  Overall, this is without one  of the best movies I have ever seen.  It's got great cinematography,,  acting, and direction.  Everything you should want in a movie.

877739,1,6304457359,"Movie 9 of 1975 and 30 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

What makes ""The Man Who Would be King"" better than ""Serpico"" is that it is mercifully short. I hate movies where I really can't critique the ideas or story. This is one of those movies. What I have to say is that movies with this much dialog should never be made. At about the half way mark this begins to actually become a real film, a story told with pictures. The half point is way too late to start giving me a movie instead of a visual book with as many words. I never cared about the main characters. They were clever but so what? I couldn't detect any profound motive for their adventure other than to get rich. If there was a deeper meaning it was lost in the wordyness of the movie which I lost track of. This is my first John Huston film and I won't judge him on just this one but I'm very disappointed in him on this one. Boring movies don't deserve my best effort so no pro/con list, I'm not even going to proof read this. Despite having some good sleep I'm going back to bed because this movie quite literally bored me back to sleep. It truly was a challenge to stay awake.

I feel it important to be honest so I'll say that there was a second half to the film I didn't realize was there in the back of the disk. I have tried to motivate myself to watch it and see if it changes my opinion. I'll hopefully get around to it next time I can't sleep.",1515283200,,1436,4.070671378091872

Based on a Rudyard Kipling story and packed with spectacle, humour, excitement and bold twists of fate, with director John Hustons film THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING earns its crown as An Epic like no other. One of the screens greatest yarns (Peter Perry of Guide for the Film Fanatic).

Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine find them with their chins out, shoulders squared and with a sly wink, star as British sergeants Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot and Peachy Carehan. The Empire was built by men like these two. Now they're out to build their own Empire, venturing into remote Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan, the province is now known as Nuristan), in the hope of becoming ""gods,"" but unfortunately they lose everything and find out that destiny was definitely not on their side, meaning they were both hoping that some kind of hidden power is believed to control their future events; like fate.

FILM FACT No. 1: Awards and Nominations: 1976 Academy Awards: Nominated: Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material for Gladys Hill and John Huston. Nominated: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration for Alexandre Trauner, Peter James and Tony Inglis. Nominated: Best Costume Design for Edith Head. Nominated: Best Film Editing for Russell Lloyd. 1976 Golden Globes: Nominated: Best Original Score in a Motion Picture for Maurice Jarre. 1976 BAFTA Awards: Nominated: Best Cinematography for Oswald Morris. Nominated: Best Costume Design for Edith Head. 1976 Writers Guild of America: Nominated: Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium for Gladys Hill and John Huston. Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine later sued Allied Artists for what they felt was improper percentage profit share and they were reportedly awarded $250,000 each.

FILM FACT No. 2: When Peachy Carehan remarks of himself and Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot having to fight through the Khyber Pass under ""Bob"" Roberts he is referring to the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878-1880 and to General Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts. The film inaccurately has Peachy Carehan referring to himself as a ""gunnery sergeant;"" the correct rank for this time is that of colour sergeant. Maurice Jarre scored the film and invited classical Indian musicians to participate in the recording sessions with a traditional European symphony orchestra. A key song, which figures within the plot of the movie, is a fusion of the music of the Irish song ""The Minstrel Boy"" with the lyrics of Reginald Heber's ""The Son of God Goes Forth to War."" This song is heard at key moments in the music film score, notably being sung by Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot as he is being executed and as he tumbles to his death. The film's performance of The Minstrel Boy is by William Lang, late of the Black Dyke Band and the London Symphony Orchestra.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING [1975] opens with author Rudyard Kipling [Christopher Plummer] working in his study and his solitude is broken by the arrival of a tattered, half-mad derelict, who is soon revealed to be his old acquaintance Peachy Carnahan [Sir Michael Caine]. As Rudyard Kipling listens in rapture fascination, Peachy Carnahan relates the incredible adventures of himself and his partner-in-chicanery Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot [Sir Sean Connery].

Con men Peachy Carnahan and Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot have masterminded all sorts of underhanded money-making schemes, the most elaborate of which takes them eventually to a remote city in the hills of eastern Afghanistan in a place called Kafiristan, (in modern-day Afghanistan, the province is now known as Nuristan), and it is through methods both foul and fair, and with the help of Peachy Carnahan instils in Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot to pass himself off as the incarnation of Alexander the Great, and of course to be able to lay their hands on the vast riches all around him. Unfortunately, Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot begins to believe his own lies, and the results are disastrous for both himself and Peachy Carnahan. Inadvertently exposing Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot's scheme is his native wife Roxanne, played by Shakira Caine (Sir Michael Caine's real-life wife).

THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING is set in colonial India in the l800s, and the film follows the exploits of two rogue British Army sergeants, Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot [Sir Sean Connery] and Peachy Carnehan [Sir Michael Caine]. During a skirmish, Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot is shot in the chest with an arrow; rather than entering his flesh, and it lodges in his bandolier or a bandoleer [a pocketed belt for holding ammunition] which of course was worn under his red tunic coat and not as stated with different reviews of this film that the arrow struck the Masonic pendant that was originally owned by Rudyard Kipling, but cheekily purloined by Peachy Carnehan. To the natives astonishment, Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot draws the arrow out without a trace of blood or injury, leading them to believe him to be a god. But when both soldiers eventually end up in their ultimate destination, but when eventually the High Priest is about to plunge the sword into Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot and suddenly sees the Masonic medallion, that is when Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot is declared and crowned as a god. But the two soldiers take advantage of their situation with great relish and the luxuries are bestowed upon them in great quantities, But with an unfortunate twist of fate happens to Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot, and on the fateful day when their sham is discovered and the natives turn on them with great ferocity and eventually a dreadful fate is bestowed upon Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot.

THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING manages to be great deal of fun in itself while being most faithful to Rudyard Kipling, whose story, written in the 1890's, is a kind of raffish metaphor for the British colonial experience that did not end for another half century. But this really isn't what THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING film is about. It's a tall tale, a legend, of steadfastness, courage, camaraderie, gallantry and greed, though not necessarily in that order. Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot and Peachy Carnehan are grand and totally old-fashioned adventurers with the gift of gab and a sense of style. Outrageously disguised as a holy man and his servant, they climb mountains and cross glaciers to penetrate the forbidden territory where, through luck and a series of coincidences, they realise their wildest dreams.

Director John Huston has done a magnificent job capturing the exotic quality, excitement, and morality of Rudyard Kipling's tale. Sir Michael Caine and Sir Sean Connery are perfectly matched as the comrades whose wit, courage, and ambition carry them into the fulfilment of their dream. The cinematography by Oswald Morris is suitably lush, and the musical soundtrack of Maurice Jarre is a romantic counterpoint to the action throughout the film.

Rudyard Kipling's story is brought to life in grand style by Sir Sean Connery, Sir Michael Caine and director John Huston, in bringing the Rudyard Kipling's characters pay dearly for their avarice. While bedridden as a child, director John Huston became a student of Rudyard Kipling's writing. In an l976 article for the Film Encyclopaedia, John Huston remarked, ""I read so much Rudyard Kipling, it's in my unconscious and when you start a verse, you have to finish it.

Though director John Huston never leans toward blunt social commentary, Rudyard Kipling's allegory of the waning days of the British Empire reads clearly enough throughout the film, and the result was a rare screen chemistry that drives the narrative wonderfully. Also Sir Michael Caine said, ""Most directors today don't know what they want  so they shoot everything they can think of. They use the camera like a machine gun, whereas director John Huston used it like a sniper."" The film is on a grand-scale; where they ""don't-make-'em-like-that-anymore"" adventure that plays out like Rudyard Kipling himself would likely have imagined it.

Christopher Plummer holds down the role of Rudyard Kipling himself in a performance that makes it difficult to imagine anyone different playing the role and on top of all that Christopher Plummer doesnt have the opportunity to be as playful or cheeky as his co-stars Sir Sean Connery and, Sir Michael Caine in their colourful characterizations who provide the anchor with the film, and who instil a sense of legitimacy to the story, even though of course it is, of course, not true. The film THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING has steadily grown in stature and reputation in over thirty-years since it initial release in the cinema and John Huston said of his personal epic, especially the gestation period during which he hoped to get his film made, and at times feared he would never get made, and said, To see a dream realized is one of the most rewarding things that can happen to a person. And for thousands of movie-lovers worldwide, seeing THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, which is one of the greatest adventures in film history, especially in home cinema set-up and in pristine high definition is of course an incredible rewarding experience.

Rudyard Kipling writes about a world gone, a geography gone. It's the world of adventure, high honour, mystery."" Rudyard Kipling's romantic worldview may well have informed Huston's adult life, with his experiences as a Mexican cavalry officer, big-game hunter, boxer, painter and even opera singer. There could be no more perfect director as John Huston then, to helm the larger-than-life story of THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING [1975].

As a nice little bonus, I think it is good to know the actual Filming Locations of THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING [1975] which is as follows: Atlas Mountains, Morocco; Glen Canyon, Utah, USA; Grande Monte, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix, Haute-Savoie, France; Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, UK; Tagadirt el Bour, High Atlas, Morocco (representing the Er-Heb village); Tifoultoute, Morocco (representing the battle scene); Ouarzazate, Morocco and Todgha Gorge, Morocco (representing the Khyber Pass).

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video has brought you this 1975 film release and upgraded in 2003 with this Blu-ray disc in superb 1080p encoded image and equally impressive is the 2.40:1 aspect ratio to show off the best aspect of this film. The source is clean and lacks any kind of grain, so it is likely a light bit of DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] has been applied. Christopher Plummer's face looks too smooth in a few close-ups, but later on in the film I was surprised by the facial detail of deep wrinkles of the withered faces of the elder Kafirs. Colours come across in very strong hues, from the clothing, particularly the vividness of the red British uniforms, to the natural surroundings made up of browns and greens. Blacks are stable throughout the film and there is some occasional crush at night and so a good contrast appears throughout the film. Although softness creeps in during establishing shots and into some backgrounds, details look sharp.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video gives us just the one 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio experience because of the time when the film was originally released, as they did not have the audio technology like you get today and remaining authentic to Warner Home Video original mono presentation. The audio track is perfect especially with the dialogue, which is very clear, but to experience this I had to crank up the sound a few notches. Although overall it is limited in dynamics, there's a good sound mix of elements, especially when effects can be heard while the music plays, such as in the opening sequence at the marketplace where the sounds of manual woodworking can be heard among the street musicians. The gunfire sequences throughout the film come across as very authentic. Maurice Jarre's music film score sounds absolutely wonderful, and the overall mix is fulsome and very enjoyable.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Call It Magic: The Making of THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING [1975] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:00] Here we have a vintage special feature that gives us a mix of clips from the film, but also plenty of talking head interviews, with a heavy emphasis on recapping the overall premise of the film. We also get a few behind-the-scenes shots and a number of excerpts from the film itself. John Huston speaks briefly about how long he had been pursuing in making the film THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, to the point of Clark Gable and long-time John Huston collaborator Humphrey Bogart heading his initial dream cast of actors. The sight of seeing John Huston at work on the set in Morocco in the Atlas Mountains is absolutely wonderful, where we get a very detailed look into the film's most ambitious stunt, where we get an in-depth look at the technical stunt set-up where Sir Sean Connery has to fall to his death, which we are informed that it was at a rate of 60 mph when the rope bridge is destroyed by the priest and director John Huston was very pleased with the shoot. ""Call It Magic"" is rather a cursory, but still fairly intriguing as a historical document that is a joy to watch, even though it is not very long, but certainly packs in a lot of information about the film and all who were involved in the project overall. Narrated by Don Morrow.  Contributors include: John Huston [Director], Sir Michael Caine [Actor], Sir Sean Connery [Actor], John Foreman [Producer] and M. James Arnett [Stunt Coordinator]. Directed by Ed Apfel and Lawrence Tetenbaum. Produced by Ed Apfel and Lawrence Tetenbaum. Cinematography by Adam Giffard.

Theatrical Trailer [1975] [1080i] [1.78:1/2.40:1] [1:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING. Although it was a brilliant presentation, but this is the strangest Theatrical Trailer I have ever witness, where it is shown in two different aspect ratios.

BONUS: This is brilliant printed 34-page Limited Edition DigiBook that features several writings on the film entitled THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING: A DREAM REALIZED, A FILM REMEMBERED. SEAN CONNERY as . . . Daniel Dravot. MICHAEL CAINE as . . . Peachy Carnahan. CHRISTOPHER PLUMBER as . . . Rudyard Kipling. JOHN HUSTON: Director/Screenwriter. KIPLING: A Storyteller for the Ages. ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS. As an added bonus with this beautiful printed DigiBook, is that you get lots of wonderful black-and-white and colour photographs relating to the film. Also I love that on page 3 you get the following Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy. Famous first line of Rudyard Kiplings novel The Man Who Would Be King.

Finally, for those seeking adventure set at a time when parts of the world used to be mysterious and exotic, then the film THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING ' is just the ticket for you, as the fun pairing of Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine certainly pays off, as the two actor are obviously and clearly having a ball throughout the film and it is a shame they were never able to team up again. With the film  THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, not in a very long while has director John Huston, who wrote the screenplay with Gladys Hill and also directed the film, been so successfully light-hearted and so consistently in command of his subject directing this film, especially showing these small-time fraudsters and con men getting well over their heads in a very big way and have always appealed to the scenario by this director, and Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot as played by Sir Sean Connery and Peachy Carnehan as played by Sir Michael Caine, are two of his nicest discoveries for director John Huston and  definitely give a larger-than-life, robust, sometimes curiously prim but suddenly stalwart in the crises that befall them. Christopher Plummer also gives the film great weight in the role of the young Rudyard Kipling, who as a newspaperman in India, participates in the beginning and the end of the story to great effect. Highly Recommended!

Upon its 1975 release, people said, even then, They don't make 'em like that anymore."" Of course not. When the legendary director John Huston first started trying to make the film with the legendary  Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, Bogart unfortunately died on him. It then took a few more decades before Huston was finally able to make the film, with his dream cast, Sean Connery and Michael Caine as Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan.

Connery and Caine  chins out, shoulders squared, with a sly wink, star in this  rollicking tale, an epically-scaled satire of imperialism; packed with spectacle, humor, excitement, bold twists of fate. The good-natured repartee of Caine and Connery is perfect.  The Maurice Jarre score  what a talented composer he was-- is grandly evocative, makes superb use of the song The Minstrel Boy. And of course, we end up loving these men more than we would have thought possible.

And, though I have long considered myself a feminist, I love this movie too, as did my Dad.  Who could fail to be moved by the performances of  Caine and Connery. Not to mention Shakira Caine, Michaels wife, as Roxanne, the village beauty Connery wishes to wed.  A note here to the fools in Hollywood who insist on remaking movies people love, principally for the actors outstanding performances, with artistic midgets who cant begin to fill their predecessors shoes.  Please leave this one alone. There are no new Connerys or Caines available. As there are no new Patrick Swayzes, Walter Varicks, Frank Sinatras or young Harrison Fords.

The film is here presented in a wide-screen letterbox format; it has been enhanced for wide-screen TVs. While I am on this business of film kind of chat, I bought this DVD to replace a longtime held VHS tape of the movie.  But man, it is one weird set up. When it was done, I checked to see by whom  it  was made, Warners.  When it almost seemed like it must have been made in Outer Mongolia or somewhere similar. The viewer must turn over the DVD  for the films second  half. And only at its end did the film offer subtitles. Which in my VHS days I didn't need, but sure need now that am getting old,  for the pictures crisp entertaining British dialog. There are also bonuses: vintage featurette Call it Magic: The Making of the Man Who Would Be King, John Huston movies trailer gallery, production notes.

877948,5,6304457359,"I'd probably seen The Man Who Would Be King in theaters or via VCR-rental at least a dozen times before I finally bought the CD.  I saw it originally when it first came out and thought it was wonderful, hence my many subsequent viewings.

In about 1993, a friend was showing me an article in a quarterly lifestyle-supplement to Forbes magazine, the gist of this article being 'If you go to the video-rental store with some particular movie in mind, but it's unavailable, choose something from our list of ~40 little-known movies -- you won't be disappointed.'  So I said to him, I wonder if their list includes what I consider the greatest movie ever made, The Man Who Would Be King.  And, yes, it was on the list -- as ""the greatest movie ever made""!

It's a terrific swashbuckling adventure, and the key genius was director John Huston.  Some years after first seeing the movie, I read, with great anticipation, Rudyard Kipling's short story of the same title, the inspiration for the movie.  And I was thoroughly disappointed by it; it seemed like just a sketch of a story, so it was Huston who apparently reconceived it as the romantic masterpiece of a movie that it is.",1485561600,4,1174,4.615384615384615

878076,4,6304457359,"Sean Connery and Michael Caine play a pair of razor-sharp scoundrels, scamming their way through an east Asian joyride during the twilight of the 19th century. On a thoroughly unpredictable adventure, the duo constantly converts lemon to lemonade as they meander from a publisher's office in India to a fictional holy land in the desert. There, intending to conquer a few villages and live the high life, the stakes suddenly spike as they find themselves anointed saviors, kings and (eventually) gods. Connery and Caine, good friends away from the screen, bubble with chemistry throughout. Their relationship is essential, and that obvious bond lifts an already-ambitious screenplay into something greater than the sum of its parts. When viewed with contemporary eyes, the pace is a little slow, akin to similar films of the era, but that deliberate tempo reaps unique rewards. By lingering in the atmosphere and dutifully setting the stage, director John Huston expertly depicts the vast cultural differences between our conniving, almost-modern Brits and the ancient ways of life still at play in turn-of-the-century Asia. A fine example of old-style filmmaking, loaded with snappy humor, surprising plot turns, high stakes and creeping peril.",1479859200,,1245,5.422680412371134

878141,4,6304457359,"The Story brought to screen is an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's short story of the same name -
The story is told to journalist and writer 'Rudyard Kipling' (Christopher Plummer) by 'Peachy Carnehan' (Micheal Caine)
He tells of his adventure with fellow former British Soldier serving in India 'Daniel Dravot' (Sean Connery) ....they decide
to trek to the remote lands of 'Kafiristan' where no white man had been seen since conquered by Alexander The Great
some 2200 years ago.....they hoped to find their fortune and indeed the acclaim of it's inhabitants.
The two are accomplished criminals and con-men in truth, well-practiced in the art of gun-running ...so to take guns to
the remote lands an obvious course of action for them.
The journey which takes them across snow-covered mountain terrain, perilous, however good fortune was with them...
they arrive in 'Kafiristan'
Their first encounter with the local populous is from a distance, they witness masked riders trying to abduct the local
woman-folk, their intervention would prove to be a good introduction to the local tribesmen.
What if they could train-up a force of tribesmen to take-on the masked intruders, success would give 'Daniel' and 'Peachy'
a foothold in the territory.
As events unfold and tribe after tribe become united the two former soldiers standing has elevated them to be considered
heroes among the tribesmen...however when during a battle 'Daniel' is struck by an arrow which seemingly does no harm,
the final victory over enemies is quickly concluded.
The story of the arrow reaches the 'Holy City of Sikandergul' the pair are summoned by the high-priest who intends to
re-enact the arrow incident to see if 'Daniel' bleeds, however the arrow does not leave the bow thanks to 'Peachy's'
intervention....the high-priest and the monks grab 'Daniel' believing him to be a fraud, when ripping open his shirt however
they see 'Danny's' masonic-jewel he wears around his neck (given to him by Rudyard Kipling before the two set upon the
adventure) the sign is recognised by the high-priest as the symbol of Sikander (Alexander The Great)...the holy-man becomes
convinced that Danny must be the son-of-Alexander (Alexander had over 2000 years earlier promised to return)..they declare
'Daniel' as their 'King and indeed God'
'Daniel' accompanied by 'Peachy' are shown vast treasures which 'Daniel' is told are his by right....
All will go well for them, however surely there is a time to walk away before it is realised that 'Daniel' is not really a God ?
The love of the power could be an overwhelming factor for 'Daniel' despite 'Peachy' saying they should leave with all the
riches they can carry.....
A light hearted and enjoyable romp from the mid-seventies which i myself hadn't watched in many a day despite owning
the DVD for many years....worth a spin...or indeed a first visit.",1475020800,,2863,5.106609808102346

When it was opened for Christmas and several weeks later we tried to watch it, it will only play about 2/3 of the way through then it hops back to the beginning.  Even by trying to load the specific scene and proceed from there, it will not play all the way through.  I was disappointed to learn that it is too late to return it.  Is there a way to determine who actually sold it to me?  And perhaps they would give me a credit?? or replace it.

Catholic church, and why they should have been considered a ""lost tribe."" The movie should have shown Michael Caine's
crucifixion and how he escaped with his life-- as he was also king as well as Sean Connery.

I had eye surgery day before yesterday, and my surgeon, Dr. Patel, was from India and is a Kipling expert. He and I quoted Kipling to each other. So we are Kipling scholars, and we recognize when a movie is true to Kipling's intentions. This movie, based on a short story by Kipling, is truly magnificent. It varies from the story only very slightly and not in any substantive ways except that is shows Kipling in his 40s working a newspaper in India. In fact he was in his teens when he worked for the newspaper. But it made full and rich use of his Masonic membership and his great interest in the Masons. The conclusion was mind-blowing, as we see Kipling half risen from his chair, his face a mask of horror at what he sees. I have rarely enjoyed a movie more. This combined adventure, understanding of human nature, and real literature. I could not help contrasting it to My Boy Jack (see my review of it) which is fascinating but simply untrue. I recommend this for everybody, whether or not they have any interest in Kipling as a man.

Based on a Rudyard Kipling story and packed with spectacle, humor, excitement and bold twists of fate, John Hustons film of The Man Who Would Be King earns its crown as an epic like no other. One of the screens great adventure yarns (Danny Peary, Guide for the Film Fanatic). Sean Connery and Michael Caine  chins out, shoulders squared and with a sly wink  star as British sergeants Danny Dravot and Peachy Carnehan. The Empire was built by men like these two.

879927,5,6304457359,"John Huston believed that, if a director cast the right actors, a large part of the filmmaking was done before the cameras ever rolled. In his 46 year career, Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor (""The Maltese Falcon"",1941), Bogart and Walter Huston (""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"",1948), Bogart and Katharine Hepburn (""The African Queen"",1951),on through Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston (""Prizzi's Honor"", 1985) and Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann (in the director's final film, ""The Dead"" (1987), proved the wisdom of the director's choices.
 When John Huston began his late career renaissance in the 1970's, he was able to work with a perfect duo, Sean Connery and Michael Caine, in the 19th century Kiplingesque bromance, ""The Man Who Would Be King"" (1975).  And what a perfect pairing the Scot Connery (the best loved of all the James Bonds) and the Cockney Caine (everyone from ""Alfie"" to Alfred, the Dark Knight's butler/surrogate father) make. In my personal film pantheon of the past half century, only Paul Newman and Robert Redford in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969) and ""The Sting"" (1973) offer brusque masculinity and emotional gradation comparable to Connery and Caine's. They're in perfect step throughout the film, even lighting each other's cigar simultaneously. Then there was that Best Supporting Actor handoff from Caine to Connery at the 1988 Academy Award ceremony.
""The Man Who Would Be King"" is, like its Kiplingesque predecessor, ""Gunga Din"" (1939), a celebration of imperialism, both material and racial. ""Kafiristan"", the film's thinly veiled stand-in for Afghanistan, exists only so that two greedy, if likeable, con artists and former members of Her Majesty's forces in India can, in the words of Daniel Dravot (Connery), ""loot the country four ways from Sunday."" The treasure that they stumble upon, and to which their Masonic insignia gives them access, was originally accumulated by Alexander the Great, the ur imperialist. Alexander, according to the film's cheeky script, was also the ur Mason. Who knew?
The tribal divisions which are very much in evidence in today's Afghanistan and which have thwarted efforts at control by the ancient Greeks, the British Raj, the Russians, the Taliban and, to some extent, the Americans, play both humorous and brutal roles in the film's narrative. The various tribes urinate downstream while their enemies are bathing or doing laundry; the sport of choice involves playing polo with the decapitated head of one's enemy. The one Asian with a significant role is Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey),who speaks a fractured English learned during his time  serving first in the British military and then as the translator for the Connery and Caine characters. An earlier figure of fun was an Indian businessman who, after spitting watermelon seeds on the floor of a railway carriage, is unceremoniously thrown off the train.
One has to admire the courage and fortitude of the Connery and Caine characters, if not their moral flaws which include cultural condescension, greed and undue self regard. This last is especially true of Dravot who believes his own mythmaking and thinks that indeed he is the long lost descendant of Alexander. He can therefore marry his own Roxanne (the drop dead gorgeous Shakira Caine, Michael's wife) and father a long line of kings. The original Alexander may have died over 300 years before Christ was born but his after life includes Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989) and Oliver Stone's ""Alexander' (2005).
All the technical aspects of ""The Man Who Would Be King"" are first rate and earned Oscar nominations for art direction/set decoration, costumes(Edith Head) and film editing, as did the Huston/Gladys Hill script. The desolate grandeur of Morocco and the stunning glacial beauty of France's Mt. Chamonix, lovingly rendered by Oswald Morris' cameras, make impressive stand-ins for the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas. Maurice Jarre, master of widescreen epic romantic scores from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) to ""Doctor Zhivago"" (1965) to ""A Passage to India"" (1984), provides the appropriately colorful, expansive and pseudo-ethnic flavoring.
As a rabid Blu-ray collector, I especially appreciate the care that Warner Brothers took with this 2011 re-issue. It's encased in a small hard bound book which features superlative film stills, shots of cast and crew, costume sketches and mini-biographies of the major players before and behind the cameras.

In the John Huston tradition of The African Queen, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and The Asphalt Jungle, it is a perfect balance of action, humor, hope, tragedy, absurdity and the human condition. Huston had wanted to make the film back in the 1950s with Clark Cable and Humphrey Bogart. Later he hoped to film it with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, then thought of using Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. By the early 70s he was hoping to cast Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but Newman suggested that British actors should play the roles, and it was he who recommended Connery and Caine.

The film is not ""politically correct"" in its depiction of the native peoples, but it is an accurate representation of the smug superiority and arrogance of European colonialism in the late 19th century.

880275,5,6304457359,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  ""The Man Who Would Be King"" is based on a Rudyard Kipling short story of the same title.  I've never read that story, so I can't say how faithful the film is.  I will say that Christopher Plummer (as Kipling) gives the strongest performance of the lead cast, despite having the least amount of screen time by far.  The basic plot: circa 1880 India, two former British soldiers and ne'er-do-wells hatch a crazy scheme to conquer Kafiristan (basically, northern Afghanistan).  They plan to loot the country of all its wealth, return to England, and retire as rich gentlemen.  Do they succeed?  You'll just have to watch the movie.  The moral of this story is ""quit while you're ahead""...which is kind of ironic, given the final scene.

Two differences I've noticed in this edition (and the DVD) compared the VHS release.  The first is the scene where our heroes meet Billy Fish for the first time.  In the original, Billy yells, ""You just wait one jiffy!""  This dialogue is absent, as is the short sequence where the crown falls from Connery's head.  Even so, the movie is as good as it ever was, and I highly recommend it.  There is some violence, but little blood (at least by today's standards), and two scenes of very brief (rear) nudity.  Although this is not the best Blu-ray transfer I've watched, it stands far above any of its predecessors in A/V quality, so it's worth upgrading; this is especially true of the beautiful landscape vistas, which can now be seen in their full glory (BTW, it's 16x9 widescreen).  One thing that annoyed me about the dvd version is that you had to switch sides to view the whole film, and that issue has been resolved.

Special features are minimal: a theatrical trailer, and ""Call it magic: the making of The Man Who Would Be King,"" which I found uninteresting.  However, the dvd booklet is attractive and well done.  You'll get a three page history of how the movie came to fruition; one page bios of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, and John Huston; and a two page bio of Kipling and his work.  The booklet also contains many production photos and artwork.

I really liked this film; while mostly a tale of adventure, it's also warning about how hubris can destroy one's goals even after achieving them, and drag one's friends down as well.  The movie also has a fair amount of humor, mostly in the first half, when Connery and Caine are training their ragtag ""army.""  And in case you wonder, the theories about Alexander the Great and Freemasonry are fanciful, and were invented for the film's story.

Favorite quote (Caine as Carnehan): ""Sir, I resent the accusation of blackmail.  It is blackmail to obtain money by threats of publishing information IN a newspaper, but what blackmail is there in accepting a small retainer for keeping it OUT of a newspaper?""",1382140800,12,2878,4.730923694779117

881076,5,6304457359,"Talk about chemistry on screen! The Man Who Would Be King is a big budget, over the top adventure, with strong character development, and features Bond veterans Connery and Master of Horse Bob Simmons, Christopher Plummer, and Michael Caine.
Add in Shakira, Michael's stunning wife, a 100+year old priest, an Afghan actor who hams every scene, and a likable Indian actor who becomes the sacrificial lamb of the epic film.
The most enjoyable aspect is the on screen chemistry of Caine and Connery. In several interviews, Sean Connery has stated that Daniel Dravot was his favourite character to play. Why not- I genuinely felt that he was having the time of his life during the making of this film. Contrast that to his ""You Only Live Twice"" performance. The mid '70's was a good time for Connery- he had lost some weight, moved to Spain, and finally was in a string of very good films, including ""Robin and Marian,"" ""A Bridge Too Far,"" and ""The Wind and the Lion.""
Makes you forget Zardoz, The Offense, Molly McGuires, etc.

Caine is his usual affable and just superb self. Best line in the film when asked if they were gods: ""No, we're Englishman, which is the next best thing.""

The subsequent 1980's ""buddy"" films can look back on the swashbuckler for their origins.

881151,5,6304457359,"Personally speaking, that classic line spoken by Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) is as memorable today as when I first saw his performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King/dp/630469864X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King</a>&nbsp;in 1975. It was a favorite film then as I was finishing college, and is still a personal favorite today.

This film was skillfully adapted from the Rudyard Kipling short story of the same title, a tale that I had read in my youth, and the film is one that I was compelled to share with my son as he was growing up. But in my youth, it was this line from the original short story that stood out, as it did to many:

""Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy.""

So begins Rudyard Kipling's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King/dp/0486280519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King</a>, with an echo of the last verse of the Masonic verse ""Banquet Night,"" and there are quite a few references to Freemasonry in this tale, which is considered by many to be Kipling's finest short story.

The author was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), in what was then British India, and he drew upon his experiences in Anglo-Indian society for much of his fiction. The winner of the 1907 Nobel Prize for Literature, he was the first English language writer to receive the coveted prize, and to date he remains its youngest recipient. He is regarded as a master of the short story, and his books for children are considered as enduring classics of children's literature.

""The Man Who Would be King"" is a unforgettable tale of adventure, and is told by a first-person narrator, a newspaperman in India who one can assume is Rudyard Kipling. While on a train, he meets a fascinating opportunist: ""He was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself, but with an educated taste for whiskey. He told tales of things he had seen and done, of out-of-the-way corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated, and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days' food.""

The narrator soon learns that Daniel Dravot and his fellow vagabond, Peachey Carnehan, are both passing themselves off as journalists for the newspaper for which the narrator is a real correspondent. He is fascinated by them, but does stop them from blackmailing a minor Indian rajah.

Some months later, they appear at his office in Lahore, and tell him their plan. In the words of Daniel Dravot, they have been ""Soldier, sailor, compositor, photographer, proof-reader, street-preacher, and correspondents of the 'Backwoodsman' when we thought the paper wanted one. Carnehan is sober, and so am I. Look at us first and see that's sure. It will save you cutting into my talk. We'll take one of your cigars apiece, and you shall see us light.""

The pair have have decided India isn't enough for them, and the next day they will go off to Kafiristan, to set themselves up as kings. They were going through the Khaiber with a regular caravan and with Dravot disguised as a native priest, stating, ""Who'd touch a poor mad priest?"" They have twenty Martini rifles, and with their camels, they plan to find a tribal leader, help him defeat his enemies, then take over for themselves.

The pair sign a ""Contrack"" (contract) as ""Gentlemen at Large,"" with the narrator as witness, in which they will together ""be Kings of Kafiristan,"" not ""look at any Liquor, nor any Woman,"" and that if one gets into trouble ""the other will stay by him."" They ask the narrator for the use of maps and books of the area, as a favor because they are fellow Freemasons, and because he spoiled their earlier blackmail scheme.

Two years pass, and on a hot summer night, an almost unrecognizable Peachey Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office, a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags. He tells an astonishing tale of how Daniel Dravot and he had succeeded in becoming Kafiri kings, taking over villages, and building a unified nation in Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan). Carnehan explains how the Kafiris (who were pagans, not Moslems) came to regard Dravot as a god, and the immortal son of Alexander the Great. The Kafiris practiced a form of Masonic ritual, and the pair secrets of Freemasons that only the oldest priest remembered.

But Carnehan explains that their grand schemes were shattered when Dravot made a decision that brought their kingdom down around them. And to explain any further would spoil the final outcome of this amazing tale. The Masonic connections to the growth and demise of the British Empire have been covered by many. It's a true literary masterpiece, and it's quite apparent that Kipling was quite conscious of the fact that the British Empire of that time was not eternal.

It's no wonder that the late John Huston chose Kipling's tale to create his epic 1975 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King/dp/B004NTC7EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King</a>, which starred Sean Connery (Daniel Dravot), Michael Caine (Peachey Carnehan) and Christopher Plummer (Rudyard Kipling). It had a superb supporting performance from Saeed Jaffrey, along with a rare but pivotal appearance by Michael Caine's wife, Shakira. This was a film that director John Huston had planned for years, and was nominated for four Academy Awards. The film is very true to Kipling's story, but goes into less Masonic detail.

One of the more interesting aspects of this tale is that it was loosely based on historical fact, of which Kipling was aware. Josiah Harlan, a Pennsylvania Quaker, journeyed to Afghanistan in the 1820s, and through a series of wheeling and dealing, was crowned the Prince of Ghor (a province in central Afghanistan). Ben Macintyre's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King-The-First-American-in-Afghanistan/dp/B00699S9NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan</a>&nbsp;details his story, including Freemason Harlan trading secrets with an old Rosicrucian sorcerer in an Afghan cave, and how the the British overthrow of the sitting Afghan ruler soon forced his departure.

But going back to Kipling's tale, the inevitable question arises: which is better, the movie or the book?

That would be a difficult answer for this reviewer, as both have been real favorites for many years, and John Huston had gone out of his way to keep his film as true to Kipling's story as possible. Would have to say that I rate them equally, and can easily recommend both as 5-star choices. But I will admit that every once in awhile I do pick up the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King/dp/0486280519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King</a>&nbsp;and read it. One who has enjoyed both cannot help but remember the performances in John Huston's splendid film.

881152,5,6304457359,"Rudyard Kipling's story from nineteenth-century India is brought brilliantly to the screen in this 1975 film.  It is a story that director John Huston had been trying to film for decades. He first envisioned Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart as the two British soldiers who would establish an empire in the unknown lands north of the Khyber Pass, but it would be nearly 25 years later that Huston's vision became a reality.

It should be no surprise that The Man Who Would Be King was an enormous success, given the lineup of talent: director John Huston of Maltese Falcon and African Queen fame, British actors Sean Connery and Michael Caine as the soldiers of fortune, and Canadian actor Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling.  Typical of Kipling, his story is brimming with adventure and local color, all of which the film employs to great effect.  The author was a character in his own story, although not by name as he is in the film. In the story, as in reality, he was a newspaper reporter and a brother in The Craft, the Masonic Order, which figures prominently in the film.

The tale has the elements of a Greek tragedy, with overweening pride and ambition being first rewarded with amazing success, only to be subsequently punished with divine retribution. Through it all the protagonists are loveable scoundrels, facing with humor and courage the bureaucrats of British India and the warring factions of Afghanistan and ""Kafiristan"", winning over the locals by military skill and a fortuitous coincidence of fictional ancient history, then losing it all with courageous grace.

The Man Who Would Be King is a great story, re-told by one of the greatest Hollywood storytellers directing some of the finest actors of the time. I was delighted to see this, one of my all-time favorites, become available in high definition. The DVD of this superb film was peculiar, requiring that the disc be turned over part way through the movie, and displaying marginal picture quality that was painful to watch on a large-screen television. Although the new Blu-ray is not a razor-sharp reference disc, it does deliver a major improvement in visual and sound quality, as well as the convenience afforded by not needing to flip the disc.

Special features on the Blu-ray are very sparse, just a trailer and a relatively brief but enjoyable making-of video.",1348876800,18,2350,4.934177215189873

I don't have too much to say about it, other than it's well acted and well shot, but this Kipling tale is more about how opportunists with no morals about their objective create mayhem, and eventually ascertain their goals.

881209,4,6304457359,"It's difficult to distill in a paragraph or two the pure joy of watching John Huston's 'The Man Who Would Be King.'  All the wit and prosaic grandeur of Kipling's story (simple plot, infinitely complex theme of Man athwart Civilization) is there, expertly transposed from the page into imagery and dialogue, with the addition of stunning location photography (shot primarily in Morocco's Atlas Mountains), a rich and colorful raft of extras, and pitch-perfect chemistry between Caine and Connery-- and every fine detail of it rendered with seeming effortlessness by a master filmmaker, who for more than a decade previously had been written off creatively.  A remarkable achievement akin to Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia.' 4 1/2 stars.

Now, the slight disappointment comes with Warner's current Blu-Ray release (4-minus stars).  Not that it doesn't look superb-- it does-- but there are no new special features, just the brief 'making of' documentary that appeared on the 1997 Warner DVD (and 2010 re-release); and it's clear, as has been pointed out by other astute reviewers, that there remain bits of footage missing from the original theatrical cut, which is a shame.

In India, Rudyard Kipling meets 2 con men on a train, after one of them returns a watch he stole upon discovering he is a fellow Free Mason. Caine is the brains, Connery the brawn in the team.  Kipling helps them out a bit as they transition out of the military, watching their scams with amusement and a growing sense of alarm as they never quite seem to get ahead.  They set off to make their fortunes in the wild unconquered territory north of India, somewhere but not exactly in Afghanistan.  So begins an epic misadventure that delights and frightens in equal measure.

On a hunch, they cross savage landscapes, fighting bandits and mountain frosts before emerging into a world that is apparently unchanged since the days of Alexander the Great, the last successful conqueror of the region.  Once arrived, they wheedle their way into the elite of the region with scarcely a thought as to the carnage they leave in their wake, acquiring hangers-on that serve as a kind of court to their scam.  What they do is outlandish and outrageous, but funny and yet fascinating, at least for me, at the wonder of human history.  I won't reveal what happens, in particular the nature of the scam, except to say it doesn't end well by over-step.

had been cut. One was the vision of Sean Connery's character falling into the abyss. On the blu-ray,he falls of the bridge & then you see Michael Caine's character talking to Rudyard Kipling. I also remember the tribesmen playing polo with Sean Connery's head as the ball,in the original theatrical release. That scene was also missing from the Blu-ray.

881366,5,6304457359,"This Kipling tale of adventure is brought to life by Sean Connery and Michael Caine through the direction of John Huston. The story contains humor, excitement, mystery and bold twists of fate that keeps the viewer interested throughout the film.
  The story is about two men (Sean Connery and Michael Caine) who leave civilization to adventure to a small and virtually unknown kingdom deep in the Himalayas. Their object is to seek wealth. Sean Connery wants to become a king. Both are British ex-army men that know how to fight and quickly and masterfully help a poorly organized local chieftain overcome his enemies in combat. Things happen. Connery takes an arrow in the chest but does not penetrate the chest enough to stop him from leading the soldiers and waving his sword. As soon as the men notice the arrow rigidly affixed to his chest they stop fighting and get on their knees. Surely, he is a god. But this is just the beginning.

Without a doubt it is for me Sean Connery's best picture.

I knew it was likely since I read what others had said. Still I thought perhaps that was the older one. Surely the 2010 edition wouldn't be like that. Wrong!! Wrong!! The movie could easily have fit on one side. It only runs 129 minutes. Still someone thought of splitting the movie into to halves. It is very odd, to be sure. Here's another odd one. The extras - such as they are, are found on both sides. The next to the last scene with Connery falling to his death has been oddly cut. It looks like he falls only 15-20 feet. However, I remember seeing this years ago and Connery falls, his body limp as it pluments deep into the canyon. Why was this cut, is a mystery. However, this really is a really good movie.

Other than National Treasure or stuff by Dan Brown, this is the most overt film about Freemasonry I'm currently familiar with.  I was recommended this movie by Freeman of Freemantv who is a great student/teacher of esoterica for the purpose of seeing portrayals of common Freemason greetings and what the organization is about.

If this is your goal, go to youtube and you'll find excerpts featuring these scenes and you'll save time and money.

I was really surprised that I didn't enjoy this movie more.  I've seen other movies with these actors and this director and loved them - Alfie, Zardoz, The Insider, The Maltese Falcon.  I think the rule on telling yarns is that how you feel about the journey you were taken on and what you learned is the reward itself, right?  Well, I didn't get much I couldn't already appreciate better elsewhere, I suppose.  Baron Munchausen delivers better in this regard - today's taste for far out stuff is way past what this film provides by trying to be very grounded in familar territory of mercs in world wars.

Are you an anglophile looking for Desert adventure?  Lawrence of Arabia will suit you better than this film.

This isn't John Huston's best work by far - start with Chinatown if you're unfamiliar with this LEGEND.

It is cool to see Christopher Plummer play Kipling in a role as the keeper of the flame of freemasonry he later reprised in National Treasure.

Since I was born on 03/20/76, I don't understand why I haven't seen this film or heard it praised before, considering its popularity. Speaking of popular things that go unnoticed.  I'm trying to figure out how popular the film, Help!, featuring The Beatles actually was to people who were able to see it at its release.

881369,5,6304457359,"For three decades, director John Huston was haunted by Rudyard Kipling's 1888 short story about two English adventurers in British India who become kings of remote Kafiristan, Afghanistan.

The story was inspired by the exploits and adventures of several individuals, especially Englishman James Brooke who became the first White Rajah of Sarawak, Borneo.  The ironic and satisfying ending is most likely modeled on the return of the head of explorer Adolph Schlagintweit to colonial administrators.

Huston's original intent was to star Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart but it was not to be.  Christopher Plummer is sublime as a book-ended Rudyard Kipling and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Sean Connery and Michael Caine as Danny Dravot and Peachy Carnehan who find that their ancient order of Masons offers unexpected temptations of greed, power, lust, deception and vaulting ambition.

I guess that since this is not a huge blockbuster film, there was not a lot of money around to fund a full restoration. I will say that colors in some of the street secnes do pop, the focus is soft (and it may be that way from the original film).

This movie is entertaining, fast paced but intelligent, Connery and Caine at their best, photography fantastic (restauration and transfer job were vey good), direction amazing. There is not one single NOT entertaining moment, be it a sad moment, a battle scene or whatever.

However, there's a strang characteristic to this movie that I cannot point exactly. That's the following: even Daniel and Peechy being two greedy thieves, apparently interesting only in robbing the ""naive"" people of Kafiristhan, we cheer for them, almost completely despising the barbarians who they try to rob. I, at least, not for a moment had the feeling that ""both of them got what they deserved"". No. Until the last moment, I hoped they would win, killign as many native people they could, because, in many stances, the native people were worse people than the two British.

881474,5,6304457359,"This review is in response to a one-star submittal on March 26, 2004.  It contains SPOILERS, so you've been warned.

My major interest is cultural anthropology, and there is no civilization so cruel as to lack civility nor one so civil as to hide its own form of cruelty.  Watch Scorsese's ""The Age of Innocence"" as a case in point.  However, that's not the focus of this film; to make it so reveals a literal-mindedness that can only be acquired in today's ""liberal"" universities who turn out lock-step politically-correctniks and not critical, discriminating thinkers -- the essence of eduction.

Since this is Kipling and not Conrad, I doubt the author was out to demonstrate the subtle and sometimes destructive changes technologically advanced societies visit upon native cultures.  Here it's not the native culture that's fatefully affected but Peechy and Danny.  ""The Man Who Would Be King"" is a tale of the inevitable misunderstanding when cultures clash, but also a tragic example of losing one's perspective in a foreign land.  This same phenomena was exquisitely filmed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in ""Black Narcissus,"" complete with an insecure neurotic who goes murderously native.

From the very beginning, Peechy (Michael Caine) and Danny (Sean Connery) are driven by a need found in all cultures and universal to all peoples: social status, something neither possess in India.  The two have seen the sacrifice and bloodshed of war and now refuse the undignified job of holding doors open for blowzy women.  As Kipling wrote, ""It's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' 'Chuck him out, the brute!' But it's 'Saviour of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot.""  So off to Kafiristan they go for adventure and the possibility of regaining their status by acquiring material treasures -- always highly valued in the West.

Peechy never looses sight of the material treasures, but Danny is cursed.  He takes an arrow in battle and survives -- a sure sign he's a God, the God Alexander, to the Kafiristan elders.  Ah, to become a God; it's irresistible and apparently less self-serving than Peechy's more practical wants.

At first Danny is a magnanimous God, a King helping to unite Kafiristan and act with Solomon-like wisdom in addressing the problems of ""his people.""  But just as surely as in Acton's England, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And what is corrupted?  Danny's assessment -- nay, irrational belief -- in his own powers.  And what will it mean?  The inevitably violent reaction of a tribal people to foreigners breaking a deadly serious cultural taboo and exposing themselves as mere mortals.

Danny's talisman, the arrow that made him a God and which he now wields like a scepter, fails him when he attempts to take Roxanne for his wife.  Tragically, Danny has betrayed his oath to swear off women during this journey besieged with ironies.  Certainly, Gods make their own rules, but even They are at the mercy of nature and the power of culture, which have the final say as they always do, so poor Danny falls from grace like a ""penny whirligig"" into the bowels of the earth.

Only if Danny would have been more practical like Peechy, but Danny wouldn't settle for base treasures; in reaching higher he deserves a spectacular and curiously noble end.  And Peechy?  He's destined to wander the earth alone, a man with an unbelievable story and a peculiar wisdom few can appreciate.  An out-of-focus still frame of Danny's crowned skull punctuated by Jarre's highly effective score with echos of ""The Minstrel Boy"" make for a wonderfully melancholy finish to a first rate film.

To call this a satire is a disservice to Rudyard Kipling and John Huston, one of the finest and most American of directors.  From a cultural and psychological perspective, this is a further examination of man's unquenchable need for social status that Huston began with ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" itself a brilliant adaption of Chaucer's ""A Pardoner's Tale.""

Within American culture, status is synonymous with the acquisition of gold, silver, money with its Masonic symbols -- you choose the means -- and is sadly dismissed as greed.  However, greed is an inadequate word to capture the flush of emotions and elevation of status that accompanies such ownership.  For their possessor, these materials have a mystical quality and a dangerous one; it's what makes the end of ""Sierra Madre"" so effective as nature reclaims its own and leaves few survivors free of this mysterious substance, this oro diablo.  Come to think of it, Huston covered similar ground in his incomparable ""The Maltese Falcon.""

The late John Huston was a great auteur of the American (and British) way, without the typical black and white judgments we've come to expect from lesser talents.",1264032000,8,4811,5.008805031446541
881475,5,6304457359,"Hoping for riches beyond belief, two British officers set off into the blank spots on the map with only a few crates of guns and the willpower to become more. They have a plan, too, and it involves creating a powerbase that will make them rich beyond their meager means. When they find themselves surrounded by gold and thought to be the rightful heirs of alexander the Great's riches, however, the two find themselves caught in a golden web that promises to either make them god-men or make them deadmen. All because of the masonic symbol, a nice little arrow, and the color of their skin.

While many movies boast of having a powerful cast and a great script, this movie really does have both. It begins with two powerful actors that want to be more than common soldiers, and so they tempt fate and cross over some horrific terrain. When they get to wherever they are going, they show the people rifles, begin setting up camp, and find themsleves getting more material gains. Then they hear of a temple on top of a sacred mountain and decide that they should go there and see what they can get from the seemingly peaceful people that stand guard over a mountain of gold and gems. The real power is not in the gold and jewels, however, but is instead hinged around the the acting prowess of our two main characters. One begins to believe himself a god and the other begins to wonder why they don't take the loot and split. Add to that woman problems - or obsession and the want to have it all - and you have yourself a tale that has stuck with me since i was a little kid. It has left my side as Christmas presents, as birthday gifts, and as other forms of tribute to get people to never forget it, either. and that is because it is a classic, and the story it tells rivals many of the things that people hold in the highest regard.

If you have never heard of the movie, you need to drop everything and order it now. you will feel reward right away, and you will thank yourself for listing to the cash that wanted you to spend it. If you have heard of it but have not seen it in a long time, watch it again and see it in a different light. Every few years I notice something different here, something I thought I had a grasp on, and that is enough to convince me to say that is worthy of keeping around forever. An army of people agree with this accessment, too, with the movie finding itself voted into the Top 20 movies of all time by lists like TMC, many guidebooks, people that really do not matter, and so on. The one person that does matter is you, though, and seeing this will make you rememeber what it was like to watch a movie that was bigger than life and that made you wonder if the characters could hold the cards in check or if they would see their kingdom come crashing to dust.

HOWEVER, the copy I received split the movie into two halves. This is far from satisfactory - even if there are no other faults, omissions and production problems. My DVD started with bang, but had sub-titles emblazoned under the picture. This was extremely distracting and ruined full enjoyment of the wonderful movie. I tried, many times, to find an 'editing' page (as is so often available) whereby I could delete the sub-titles, but none was available.  BUT WAIT - After turning the disc and watching the entire second half, there appeared on screen a 'Title Page' - such as I had sought earlier. It appeared possible to cancel the sub-titles - except that when one returned to the first half, the sub-titles returned to mock me!!

I am truly at a loss to understand how this complete 'Horlicks' could come to exist. Many things come to mind - including the thought that maybe, just maybe, a madman had edited the movie!

881550,3,6304457359,"Maurice Jarre, the composer of the marvelous score for The Man Who Would be King (and Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and many other fine films) died yesterday.  It is time for Warner's Home Video to honor him by re-mastering The Man Who Would Be King with half way decent sound -- sound that would give his music at least half a chance.  I would give this DVD 5 stars if they hadn't sabotaged it with weak and thin sound.  Here is an excerpt from my earlier comment comparing the DVD sound to the original theatrical sound mix:

What is going on with the sound? It's not just me! ""A Customer,"" ""UncleTom,"" and Connie M. Ash all wrote about this.  In the San Francisco theatrical release, which I saw repeatedly, the sound was magnificent, the orchestra was forward, as it should be with a score like this, and I'd almost swear it was in stereo! I was an audiophile at the time, as were my friends, and it would have been a topic of conversation at the time if a score this magnificent had been in squeaky, thin mono. Indeed, the IMDb entry for ""Sound Mix"" reads ""4-Track Stereo,"" which would be usual for a 35mm 2.35:1 release in 1975. True, some multichannel films were mixed down to mono for release in the boonies in those days, and sometimes the result was a careless, thin mix. Depending on the recording technique, phase cancellation can come into play making matters even worse; they lost most of the brass section in the chase sequence when they mixed the multitrack A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum into mono. Can I believe that the DVD people would fail to obtain a stereo version of The Man Who Would Be King? I can.
Even if it turns out that the original theatrical version was released in mono only -- but magnificent mono that fooled us all -- the original music elements may have been recorded in stereo. If so, some restorer could go back to those elements as has been done with some other films being prepared for DVD release. Soon, I hope!
So, what if mono is all there is? I believe the elements could be mixed into a relatively rich, full soundtrack by someone with talent, who cares",1238371200,3,2121,4.442159383033419
881551,5,6304457359,"I love movies that are just a great big bucket full of yet still manage to be very smart in their internal direction.  `The Man Who Would Be King' is just that movie.  It has the perfect mix of humor, adventure and intelligence that makes for an unbelievably entertaining and rewarding movie experience.

This is a total crowd pleaser.

The film follows two British soldiers, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, who are on the lookout for fame, fortune and power.  After they devise a plan to acquire great wealth they make their way to Kafiristan in order to con the people into making them kings.  While their plan seems to work (through an unintentional accident that gets misinterpreted in all the wrong ways) it also starts to take its toll, especially on Daniel, the presumed deity.

It's within the final section of the film where the smart scripting plays well into the hands of the two leads, especially Connery, who embellishes his characters power driven madness in ways that bring the film to a whole other level.  It transcends the boundaries of your typical comedy/buddy flick and becomes a strong political statement to the burdens of that `quest for power'.

There is rarely an on screen pairing as delightfully fulfilled as the pairing of Michael Caine and Sean Connery.  Both actors are divine in their own right, but here, together, they deliver such complete performances; strong in comedy as well as human drama.  They capture both sides of their characters so well; the drive to succeed and the fear of that said success.  In that final stretch we see whole new sides to these two men as they are pitted against one another in ways they didn't expect; and as Daniel's head begins to swell with his newfound power we see Peachy finally understanding the weight of their foolishness.  These two actors capture these emotions so well and deliver such laughs that I'm moved to label this quite possibly the greatest on screen duo ever, but that is always subject to change.

Just note that they are amazing together.

Director John Huston does a smart and effective job of bringing Rudyard Kipling's short story to life, filling it with a life all its own.  This is funny, sweet, poignant and totally unforgettable.  With impressive cinematography, witty banter and a meaningful tale, `The Man Who Would Be King' is nothing short of complete.",1238025600,,2359,4.8283582089552235

It is with films like this that one wants to say, ""they don't make 'em like this anymore.""  Although the acting is, indeed, flawless and exhilarating as others have noted, it is finally the totality of the film that is so outstanding. The story, of course, is brilliantly conceived by Kipling, filled with irony and pathos, a superb celebration and denunciation of Empire and its central conceit. No doubt, Huston had this one tucked in his back pocket for years. As with other Huston films, this is a story about men, their friendships, their betrayals. The story reminds me of Huston's earlier film ""The Misfits, "" starring Clarke Gable and Monte Clift. There, too, we find old friends tested by the presence of a beautiful woman. In the Kipling story, there is far more humor, a breezy quality that must have to do with the superb performances of Caine and Connery. The setting is, of course, half the wonder. The cinematography is breathtaking. I have tried showing this to youngsters without much luck.

881604,5,6304457359,"""The Man who would be King"" is the wonderful adaptation of Kipling's story of the same name.  The producers have done it justice by using the real life friends, Sean Connery and Michael Caine.  Their comradeship is whimsical, oafish and unbelievably real.

If you haven't seen it, I hate to give it away...but...I will, a little.  Caine and Connery are British soldiers just 'retired' with intentions, almost literally, of conquering the world.  They ain't too bright.  They sign a covenant in front of Kipling, himself, to go north into Afghanistan, conquer a kingdom and rob it blind.  They also agree that there will be no women.

Our boys, dressed as locals, push north through the Khyber pass.  They enter the brutal and desolate mountains of Afghanistan to face unbelievable hardships that would have destroyed lessor--make that more intelligent--men.  There are avalanches and snow blindness but remarkably, they make it to a land never exposed to white men, there culture and their weapons.  They rapidly subjugate the naive locals but are almost done under by religious monks who suspect they aren't quite as godlike as they claim.  Almost miraculously, however, they see a Masonic emblem around Connery's neck and take him to be the supernatural descendant of Alexander the Great, who passed that way 2,500 years earlier and left a Masonic symbol.

Well, our boys are 'in like flint' and the gold of the Orient is poured on their heads...but...there is the issue of women, isn't there?

881605,5,6304457359,"""The Man Who Would Be King"" is on the short list of my favorite films.  John Huston's love & dedication to this project really shines through (he had to wait 25-30 years to make it & then almost died making it)in his script & direction. Caine & Connery ARE Peachy & Danny (I'm sorry--I can't see Bogart & Gable) in what I see as career high performances.  Some eight years ago this was one of the very first DVDs I ever purchased. After viewing it numerous times since then, I have just watched it for the first times on a 42"" widescreen lcd tv. I have to say that I was surprised at how good the image was for such an old release--the DVD was released in 1997--however there is room for considerable improvement in the package. First & foremost get rid of the flipper disc, the film is 129 minutes long & can easily be fit on a dual layer dvd with room to spare for a commentary (by a critic/historian & perhaps Mr. Caine--I doubt if Mr. Connery would make himself available.) Next, reinstate the short bit at the climax showing Danny tumbling end over end with Peach narrating his fall from the bridge--it was there when I first saw the film in 1975, but is missing from television & DVD prints for some reason. Documentary material on Kipling, the short story, John Huston & the making of the film & its importance would be most welcome. As it is, there are practically no extras on the extentant disc. Please Warner Bros.--won't you at least consider it.  When you look at all the double & triple dips of junk out there, give this film a little respect.

881610,4,6304457359,"Telling a grim morality tale with a good amount of humor amidst settings of grandeur and a with sense of high adventure, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING reminds me of Kipling's more famous buddy tale of exotic adventure among dangerous natives--GUNGA DIN.

But here the telling is more leisurely and for awhile we don't know where the story is going. First, it seems a comedy, then the more adventurous elements take over and finally it goes for a gripping climax in which all hell breaks loose when the two con men are about to get their comeuppance.

As the decidedly shady characters, corrupt and acting out of a simple desire for riches, SEAN CONNERY and MICHAEL CAINE give probably the most skillful performances of their careers. My only complaint about Caine is that sometimes his Cockney accent (spoken in a hushed voice at a key moment in the film) is hard to understand. Some post-production dubbing would have been advisable.

For all of its sense of adventure, the film often plods along at a snail's pace between its more colorful episodes and could have been more tightly edited to tell its story in far less running time.

Frankly, I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek GUNGA DIN infinitely more than this Huston film. That's not to say the film is a failure. The cinematography is great and all of the performances are extremely well done--with special mention of CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER who is highly effective as Rudyard Kipling himself. His final scene is a memorable close-up after Caine has told him the truth about the harrowing end of their adventure.

Although highly entertaining at times, it's easy to see why this story of two con men is not considered to be one of John Huston's greatest. By no means a failure, it nevertheless has enough flaws and is just uneven enough to make you realize it could have been a truly great adventure film.",1204934400,2,1849,4.747663551401869

How they go about this is portrayed brilliantly by Caine and Connery. Made a few years after his last Bond film, Connery dominates the screen the whole time, but Michael Caine pushes him close and produces an at times marvellous comedic performance. I am sure Caine was influenced indirectly and directly by John Huston in this regard.

The other reason for this films greatness is of course John Huston. The direction is a lesson to all modern directors on how to grip an audiences attention whithout the need for CGI or an explosion every five minutes.

I recall the publisher, an aging hippie, carping about my recommendation of a TV broadcast of a movie based on a short story by an alleged apologist for British imperialism, Rudyard Kipling. Kipling may be un-PC these days, but I wonder if my long-ago publisher actually read ""The Man Who Would Be King"" or saw the wonderful 1975 movie that director John Huston fashioned from it. If he did, he might have realized it was a clear-eyed cautionary tale, not a celebration of British incursion. ""TMWWBK"" is one of those ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"" near-classics, and watching it you're glad that Huston had to wait so long to make it, because with all due respect to the late great director, his earlier choices for the leading roles (Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Paul Newman among them) would not have worked nearly as well as the team of Sean Connery and Michael Caine. The two actors bring authority, humor, and not a little poignancy to their roles as ex-soldiers who decide to journey to a remote, hostile Asian land and set themselves up as its rulers.

Watching the DVD again recently, I was reminded of what a strong impact ""TMWWBK"" made on me as a teenager, and it has stood the test of time better than many highly-regarded movies of its day. However, my enthusiasm is muted by the fact that the DVD itself hasn't held up nearly as well. It was issued circa 1997, when so-called ""flippers"" (DVDs that made you play both sides to see the entire movie, like an LP with awkward side breaks) were not unheard-of, even with flicks that ran for only two hours like this one. Oswald Morris' handsome Panavision cinematography translated pretty cleanly to silver disc (thankfully, it's letterboxed rather than pan-and-scan), but after a decade's advancements in DVD technology, a remastering would produce a sharper picture (and would probably improve the lackluster transfer of the soundtrack, monaural though it is). Double-sided or no, the disc is very short on extras--and as has been noted elsewhere, a key moment near the end of the movie has been inexplicably deleted, or more accurately replaced with a character's narration delivered to the camera rather than as a voice-over of this sequence. The movie deserves far better, and it's a shame that this 10-year-old ""flipper"" hasn't been superceded. The high rating I'm giving this disc is for the movie itself, not for the indifferent DVD, which will have to suffice until, I hope, a better one comes along.",1173398400,18,2707,4.846652267818574

One wouldn't know this unless they made a guess.  The disc itself reads 'reverse side additional content', which would suggest that extra or special features were on the other side, not the rest of the movie.

Why they did this?  I can't quite say.  Considering the DVD release is presented in mono with no fancy video or audio overhead that would prevent a movie from being fitted on one side of a disc, it really makes no sense.

The DVD release is also plagued with menus that are difficult to read (menu options printed over graphics which makes making out the printed text a chore to make out).

Shame, really, because this is without a doubt one of the finest movies ever made.

It is a 5 star film, but it's a shining example of poor presentation and little thought in the DVD release.

881802,5,6304457359,"John Huston's big-screen take on an old Rudyard Kipling morality tale has achieved cult status in many quarters (due largely to poor availability) and has been bit of a well-kept secret, a movie that connoisseurs and speccy alternative types can truly call their own. But not for much longer, however. A larger audience awaits. Which is a good thing. Why should a movie this good be kept out of the public eye? Sean Connery and Michael Caine, then at the top of their trades, play off extremely well against other, like old friends who seem to be having the time of their lives.  The old Ghurkha soldier who appears half-way through is a real comic tour-de-force. This is an epic movie, in the same mould as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, but without the overacting and the self-importance. In fact, the lead role here is the story (the actors just do their bit to move things along) and the breathtaking scenery.

881803,5,6304457359,"This film has met all the prerequistes necessary for producing a profound and rewarding entertainment experience. One of the greatest directors of all-time (John Huston), an all-star cast: Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer and Saeed jaffrey, and an incredibly original storyline incorporating ancient Masonic mysteries, exotic locations and crisp, witty dialogue. This is a story I wish I had written! Even more delightful, it meets all expectations!

Rudyard Kipling (Plummer) finds an unexpected guest awaiting his presence in his darkened study one night. Without proper introductions the hooded intruder begins to share with Kipling a fantastic tale of adventure and discovery from a faraway land that many thought only existed in myth and legend. The study of the famous writer soon disappears as we are taken along with the mysterious narrator on a fantastic journey to a foreign land.

We are now introduced to Daniel Dravot (Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Caine), two ex-British soldiers and Masonic brothers turn fortune hunters. Seeking fame and fortune they are about to undertake the adventure of a lifetime. Their destination, the Far East in search of the legendary lost treasure of Alexander the Great.

And what an adventure it is! As Daniel and Peachy work their way across the vast Indian landscape towards the remote region of Kafiristan they encounter the usual severe natural hardships and hostile inhabitants as you might expect. However it's the discovery of an archaic religious cult that happens to share many of the same symbols and beliefs found in their own Masonic brotherhood that really makes them begin to wonder. As they unravel the secret origin of this esoteric connection they are faced with the truth behind a two thousand year old secret concerning Alexander the Great and his mythical lost treasure.

Great film from '75. It may seem a little dated to young viewers, but give it a chance and you won't regret it!

881806,4,6304457359,"So many people love this movie, and rightly so. As rugged adventurers who are also the best of friends, Sean Connery and Michael Caine reached their career peak as Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, respectively.  But I think it's a mistake to call it an ""action movie"" or an ""epic."" For all the laughs and glamor, and the feel-good friendship of the two buddies, this movie is really a tragedy in the classical sense.

Don't watch this movie expecting RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, where the good guys win and everybody leaves the story happy and alive. It's terribly important to remember that though this movie came out just one year before STAR WARS, John Huston is miles away from the infantile zap-zap action of children like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

The movie charts the downfall of two men who try to rise too high, just like Icarus in Greek myth. Rudyard Kipling felt that men who serve in the ranks should not get ""above themselves"" and wrote this story to show what happens when such people get out of their place. At the same time, Kipling was trying to warn the English people that the British Empire would only last as long as the purpose was justice rather than greed.

Watching the movie, it's hard not to be torn. The two heroes fail in terms of empire building and politics, because they break faith with their native subjects one time too many. But at the same time, they never break faith with each other. The movie asks the question, can any person really be a failure if he/she has sacrificed everything for friendship? The final ""defeat"" of the pair is also final victory in that they maintain the one thing in their lives that was always above corruption -- their friendship. The bittersweet ending is complex and ambiguous, and signals that this is truly a masterpiece by giants of a nobler age.

John Huston is gone now, replace by pygmies like Spielberg and Lucas. They don't make movies like THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING.",1119052800,9,1952,4.6138328530259365

881808,5,6304457359,"I first saw Huston's ""The Man Who Would Be King"" in a 2$-a-show movie theatre in Philadelphia in the summer of 1976 when, as a young actor, I was going to the movies (usually at this cheap theatre) almost every day.  I was completely bowled over by it.  Even in 1976, it was clear that this was the kind of movie we weren't likely to see again.  Production costs were simply becoming too prohibitive.

Over the years, I've tried watching it again a few times on TV, but with the small screen, canned sound and frequent commercial breaks, I never finished it.  Now, in these home theatre days, I bought this DVD release looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with this true epic from a great master of the movies.

How disappointing it was, that halfway through a slightly-over-two-hours-long movie and at a most inopportune moment, the movie stopped, the screen went black and I had to flip the disc to continue.  In a longer movie with a planned intermission break this would not be a problem, but here it is simply unfathomable.  It would seem that any intelligent production company would have put the complete movie on one side of the disc and then, if necessary, put the special features on the other, but no - here we have half the movie and all the special features on one side, and the other half of the movie (again with all the special features!) on the other.  While this doesn't completely ruin the experience it does damage the continuity and lessen the viewing experience.

That warning having been given, this is a magnificent movie.  (And a ""movie"" it is, rather than a ""film"" - exciting, entertaining, moving, but with no pretensions, nothing of the gritty artiness of the mid-seventies films that today can look so dated.)

The casting is as near to perfect as you could imagine.  Huston uses both Connery and Caine brilliantly as a brace of thoroughly amoral yet endearing con men, getting the maximum advantage out of each actor's strengths.  Plummer, in the smaller supporting role of Kipling, shines as an intelligent and compassionate man, if a little slow on the uptake.

But it is Huston who, to my mind, is the real star.  A screenwriter-turned-director, he excelled at taught, intimate dramas like The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  (TotSM, despite being virtually all exteriors, still feels as claustrophobic as Hitchcock's Rope.)  However, often when he took on larger projects he seemed to lose focus.  Not here!  This movie is brilliantly paced, with its flashback narrative structure, building to its sweeping climax and then its heartbreaking, slightly chilling denouement.  Even more reason to be disappointed with the unneeded interruption lessening the dramatic flow of the story.

Buy the DVD.  Revel in this, one of the greatest movies of the action/adventure genre.  But please forgive my anger at Warner Brothers for botching what should have been a great DVD release.",1112400000,13,2932,4.876767676767677

Starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine, with support from Christopher Plummer, Shakira Caine, and the gifted Saheed Jaffrey!  Take that talent and set a ripping adventure yarn in the British Raj.  Throw in a good soundtrack and passable location shots from Morocco and the Alps.

Could it get better?  It does.  A great Masonic theme from Kipling, who was himself a Mason and loved the craft as much as he loved the Raj and his cigars!  Now spice it up with a clever script and wonderful chemistry between the stars.

Forget The Jewel in the Crown, Gunga Din, The Four Feathers, and even A Passage to India.  This is the best film set in 19th century India.

The plot?  Well, go buy the film and watch it!  Let's say that Kipling's own words from The Ballad of the East and West ring true.  And as for this movie, if we may paraphrase Rudyard, ""A woman is only a woman, but if she marries a god, she smokes!""",1109721600,7,1006,4.456043956043956
881852,5,6304457359,"The Man Who Would Be King is a throwback to the adventures films of the 1930's with great performances by Sean Connery and Michael Caine.  After a blackmail plan goes awry, ex-British soldiers Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan don't know what to do with themselves.  The duo decides to march across Iraq and  Afghanistan to the far-off and primitive nation of Kafiristan.  Once there, they plan to rob the place blind as they teach the Kafirians how to defeat their enemies with modern rifles.  However, in battle Dravot is wounded(an arrow is imbedded in his bandoleer) but not hurt making the Kafirians think that he is a god.  This movie has it all.  If you're a fan of good old-fashioned adventure movies, this is a safe bet.  You won't be disappointed.

  Sean Connery and Michael Caine are perfectly cast as Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, the two ex-British soldiers who hatch a plan to become the kings of the far-off country of Kafiristan.  By the end of the movie, you come to like the duo more than you ever thought you could.  Just like Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Connery and Caine have a real chemistry on screen that holds the movie together.  Christopher Plummer is also very good in a supporting role as Rudyard Kipling, the famous author who meets Danny and Peachy in his travels.  Saeed Jaffrey plays Billy Fish, an ex-Gurhka who serves as Danny and Peachy's translator.  The movie also stars Doghmi Larbi, Karroom Ben Bouih, and Michael Caine's wife Shakira as Roxanne, the Kafirian woman Danny takes as a wife.  The DVD offers a beautiful widescreen presentation, ""Call it Magic"" a brief 12 minute documentary about the making of the movie, and eight trailers from different John Huston movies, including The Man Who Would Be King.  The only bad part of the DVD is the dual-format(you have to turn the disc over halfway through the movie) but that is a minimal problem with a movie of this caliber.

  This is really one of those movies where everything comes together perfectly.  Great performances by Connery and Caine, brilliant directing by John Huston, beautifuly cinematography, and a great story full of action and humor.

""The Man Who Would Be King"" is rarely given the exulted status it deserves.  Basically, John Huston's film is an old-fashioned adventure that just flat-out entertains.  This is a tale that is just well told.  It was casting from heaven that teamed up Sean Connery and Michael Caine as the rogue soldiers who scheme to elevate themselves as gods in an isolated society.  It's a wonder that Connery and Caine never reteamed in a film again because their chemistry is as good as any pairings in screen history.

When Huston tried again in the 1970s, the reigning buddy team was Robert Redford and Paul Newman.  Newman's response: ""They're Englishmen, get Sean Connery and Michael Caine.""

Michael Caine has said that this was his favorite film of his own work, the one that ""will still be around when I'm gone.""

And this was the first movie I saw where I saw Sean Connery and NEVER ONCE thought of James Bond.  They really do make these characters live and breath--and they make them their own.

In both Caine's autobiography and Huston's biography, John Huston would call Caine and Connery by their characters' names to his dying day, even as the actors visited Huston on his deathbed.

This is one of my favorites, a grand, exotic adventure with literary roots and great performances from two of the world's biggest movie stars.",1103155200,6,1002,4.724137931034483

Probably by today's standard's it lags a bit in places (it's called pacing kids) and has some great action sequences but not too many exploding things. And don't forget that this movie was made before CGI etc (although several scenes are clearly matte paintings, but even those are top notch).

In short a really good, entertaining action/historical adventure film that anyone should be able to enjoy.

The DVD itself is fairly amazing. Yes, the DVD is one of those ""two sided"" deals that you will have to flip over half way through the movie, and yes, the movie tends to just start. You have to press menu to get to the menu, but those are minor quibbles. The real joy here is the amazingly clear picture transfer that was done for this film. Trust me, I have seen worse (Fiddler on the Roof for one). There are no marks, drop out or defects during the movie. Someone has really gone through and done a first class clean up job. It looks like it was filmed yesterday on digital film.

The extras are interesting, so to speak. The 12 minute short ""It Must Be Magic"" is interesting in that is has dated very badly (it goes on about how Moroccans have never seen movies etc., in a very un PC way) but provides some insights. Warning: DO NOT watch it until you have seen the movie as it contains a fairly huge spoiler!

There are also several fairly useless text info screens about Kipling and Masons etc. The other previews are for other films (although an original trailer for The Man Who Would Be King is on there too).

As has been pointed out, The Man Who Would Be King, is indeed in some ways a parable about imperialism. What it is not,thankfully, is a politically correct apologist piece that glorifies native populations and villifies Westerners. Indeed,  The Man Who Would Be King does a great job at illustrating the brutality and backwardness of pre-modern men and tribal society, while at the same time showing the more calculated violence and technology of western civilization. It also shows the positives and negatives of imperial expansion into regions untouched by modernity. From the introduction of Martini-Henry rifles and western military organization, to the beginnings of infrastructure building and liberal governance, John Houston's The Man Who Would Be King gives us far more complex and human look into the characters of Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot than Kipling's story. Indeed, one cannot help but like Peachey and Daniel; even though they may be vagabond ""detriments"" in the increasingly 'civilized' Colonial India, they are larger than life supermen when compared to some of the simple, wretched creatures that inhabit their short-lived empire in Kafiristan.

Although it's not a high budget film; with stellar performances by Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Cristopher Plummer, it's an all time classic. The acting, story line, and superb directing by Huston more than make up for some of the film's budget-related shortcomings.

  Masonic brothers Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine)feel that colonial India isn't big enough for men like them. Unemployed veterans of Her Majesty's Army with royal ambitions, they're out to make their own empire in distant Karfiristan; a gold-laden land of cruel savages who've never seen an Englishman or even less a rifle. The story is a great satire on the subject of imperialism in general and how the classic ploy of divide and conquer comes back to haunt the conqueror in the end.  The film follows the short story pretty well although it does both redact and add certain elements (i.e. Making Peachy steal Rudyard's watch; making Billy Fish a Guhrka instead of a Bashkai; introducing Roxanne instead of a faceless bride; redacting Peachy's trip to Kabul to get more guns, etc.) Despite these changes, the film doesn't deviate from Kipling's story so as to undermine its theme or plot: much of the dialogue is directly from the story.

  On a final note, Kipling had a rather low opinion of England's colonial subjects and this is strongly manifested in his works; even with the sanitizing of the story for the screenplay and script, the film is definitely not one for bleeding hearts or the politically correct variety. If you're not restricted by the latter points of view, the film is riddled with humor, adventure, and drama: a great one to own.",1090540800,4,1785,4.969798657718121

Both actors are superb here, using subtelty and terrific use of a grand screenplay.  Also, Christopher Plummer gives another professional performance as the correspondent of The Northern Star, Rudyard Kipling. This movie is based on the story of the same name written by Rudyard Kipling and is, in effect, a period film from a more naive era.  There was a plot flaw, albeit minor.  Sean Connery, for a good portion of the film is revered as a god because his subjects did not see him bleed when struck in the chest by an arrow.  The reason is explained soonafter for the audience, but I have a question: Do gods not have other bodily functions, such as relieving oneself?  Wouldn't that have made him seem less like a god and more like the rest of his followers?  I know I'm nitpicking an otherwise great film, and this small flaw is easy to ignore.

The wonderful Masonic references -- which give the story it's color and wry tone -- would've been expunged on the first round.
It's also a much more thoughtful film than you might think, and almost turns the whole British Empire-building era on its ear. Peachy and Dravot may come from the seedy underbelly of Empire, but they show how, in their day, even thieves became kings -- but never gods.
Regarding this DVD transfer: yes it's unusual to still find single-layer encoding; having to flip the disc wasn't a major inconvenience, though. But it could've been done more logically. Instead it's an abrupt, arbitrary break that makes it annoying. Otherwise, the picture and sound is quite good.
Wishful thinking here, but I'd welcome a proper dual layer transfer and some extras, too. Oh well.

881928,5,6304457359,"Ah, ""The Man Who Would Be King""... one of my all-time favorite movies.  I saw it for the first time two years ago last July, after purchasing it site unseen based on its reputation alone.  The critics and everyone else I heard speaking about it were right... this is a wonderful movie, one of the greatest ever made.  Though I've never read the short story this film is based on (in spite of being an avid Kipling fan since reading ""Just So Stories"" while I was a wee lad in second grade and ""The Jungle Books"" finally two months ago) I definitely want to now, but I really can't imagine the story being told any more perfectly than it is here.
Let me just tell you what I knew before I saw it.  Connery and Caine are British soldiers who devise a plan that will enable them to get stinking rich.  Up north of India, there's an isolated kingdom unvisited by white men since Alexander the Great.  Their plan?  Go to the kingdom, take it over (they've got guns), and loot the country... only things end up happening a little differently than they'd planned them to, and some tension starts to grow between the two men once they've seemingly got it all.
That's it, that's all you need to know.  It was enough to make me curious enough to buy it, and I'm really glad I did.  Since that first time I've seen it several more (the night before last being the most recent), and it never gets old.  Check it out... you'll love it too.
The silence of the last five minutes, which we hear between the whispered words of the two conversing characters before the film ends, is just amazing...
Check out ""TMWWBK"" immediately.  The DVD's reasonably priced, and comes with a highly interesting ""the making of"" featurette.  A word of warning, though: don't watch the making of until after you've finished the movie, as it will spoil the end for you otherwise.

I was totally caught up in it then and I am still very impressed every time I get a chance to see it again (I have it on tape but it's a beta tape).  There is a lot of adventure, mystery, action, humor and drama wrapped up in this movie.  The sets, scenery and photography are terrific as well.  Best of all, there is also a lot of great acting and directing.  Michael Caine and Sean Connery are both excellent actors who seem to elevate their preformances a notch by working together.  There is also an excellent supporting cast.
I was fascinated with the story and the concept of a tribe that had had no contact with the Western world since the time of Alexander the Great.  These two British soldiers were going to go to this land that was only rumored to exist and become their kings.  How they planned it, how they went there, how they attempted to acheive their goal (and how ""they"" came back). makes for a riveting and entertaining movie.
""The Man Who Would be King"" has become something of a cult favorite over the years.  However, don't let that mislead you.  This is no ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" that appeals only to fringe groups of movie goers.  This movie was made for all audiences and can still be enjoyed by all.  Something or other has left it off the ""A"" list of movies for the Late Show which makes it hard to find on TV.

Strangely, early reviews of this movie criticise the casting, insisting that Connery should have played Carnahan and Caine Dravot. Why this is, who knows. I think the two actors play superb roles and, as has been said before, the chemistry between them is startlingly obvious.
Carnahan and Dravot are ex-British soldiers in 19th century India during the time of the Raj. Deciding that fame and fortune is to found in nearby Kafiristan, they set out to conquor the country. This they do by a quirk of fate when Danny is falsely claimed as a god and son of Alexander the Great.
Things are fine until Danny takes a wife (played by Caine's real-life wife, Shakira). She bites him, he bleeds blood- indicating he is an ordinary mortal. Then things really go belly-up. Danny is sent plunging to the bottom of a very deep gorge and Peachy is crucified.
Fine acting by Caine, Connery and Plummer. A special mention must go to Saaed Jaffrey who plays the part of Billy Fish, the loyal ex-Ghurka.
Huston took his time to make this but, in the end, it was surely worth it.",1066780800,11,1186,4.572769953051643
882000,4,6304457359,"First, this is a remarkable movie with Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer. The Kipling story is one of his best and the acting, directing, sets, music, and all other aspects of this movie are first class. Any fan of ""Gunga Din"" or the ""The Four Feathers"" will love it.

 Our story starts out with Michael Caine, playing Peachy Carnehan, stealing Christopher Plummer's, playing Rudyard Kipling, watch. When he realizes the gold charm attached to it shows him to be a Free Mason he tries to return it. It is interesting how that little Free Mason charm changes the lives of Sean Connery, playing Daniel Dravot, and Peachy.

 Daniel and Peachy seek their fortune in a small country across deserts and mountains from India. No one has made the journey and survived to tell about it. They decide they will be kings and not drink or be familiar with women until they have reached that goal. They ask Kipling to witness their contract before their departure.

Once the two set off with a couple pack animals and some guns and ammunition, the adventures and dangers the two encounter are amazing. The sprawling landscapes and cultures they see keep us mesmerized. It is not what they expected and so it also is not predictable what will befall them. A wonderful adventure worth seeing.
Second, can someone explain why there are a handful of DVDs like this that require you to flip them over halfway into the movie? I absolutely hate that. Fortunately I only have a couple movies that require me to do that but it needs to changed.

There is no excuse for it as far as I can see since I have many movies that are longer that do not require me to flip them over. Furthermore neither of those I own give you any warning that you need to flip them, they just stop and the screen goes black. Consider boycotting this method of releasing movies.

882003,4,6304457359,"John Huston directed this 1975 film, which is based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling who was a journalist in India from 1887-1889.  Those were the years that the sun never set on the British Empire, and the colonialist perspective is taken for granted.
It's about former British soldiers played by Sean Connery and Michael Caine, who, with twenty guns and a spirit of adventure, set out to conquer the fictional area known as Kafiristan by introducing firearms, conquering warring tribes and setting themselves up as kings in order to plunder riches.  However, when local religious leaders believe that Connery is a God, there is conflict between the two men.  Trouble follows.
Filmed in Morocco with a cast of thousands, the cinematography is excellent.  John Huston sure does know how to set up a scene. There's a lot of adventure and lots of bloodshed.  And warfare orchestrated as fun and games.  None of it is politically correct, especially since everyone, with the exception of the Englishmen, are depicted an ignorant fools.  This bothered me even though I understand that the story came from another era.
All the acting was uniformly good, with Christopher Plummer cast as Rudyard Kipling and Shakira Caine, a former Miss Guyana, cast as the woman who wins Connery's heart.  The DVD had one good extra, depicting the cast on location and the actual filming of one of the most outrageous and dangerous stunts.
The only way to enjoy this film is not to take it too seriously and let yourself be transported into a world that not only is no more, but that never was. The story had enough twists and turns to hold my attention but it was just too dated for my taste.  Perhaps it might have been acceptable when it was first written more than a hundred years ago, and perhaps the audience in 1975 liked it.

Then for years he wanted to bring this adventure story by Kipling to the screen. How many years? Well, originally he had Bogie and Gable in mind for the leads, you do the math.
Fortunately for us, he eventually got the green light for his project.
 He then found Peachy and Danny in Michael Caine and Sean Connery, movie stars who are also great actors-- of which there ain't many, folks---and who are perfectly cast in the roles.
Moreover, Caine and Connery had been friends for a long time and this undoubtedly helped bring to life the camaraderie between the misfit heroes.
It is the late 19th century and Danny and Peachy, formerly sergeants in Her Majesty's Army, find themselves stranded and penniless in India. Their ungrateful country has no further use for them, although their officers once called them heroes ""We fought our way up the pass yard by bloody yard.""
 Now, bureocrats are running the show ""with long skinny noses for looking down on you"" and Danny and Peachy are considered 'undesirables'.
So they are faced with three choices: Go back to England and take jobs as a porters or something equally lower class and  menial, stay in India and continue to live more or less as petty criminals, or. . .
Well, let's not give the plot away. Suffice it to say that when a reasonable Kipling (wonderfully played by Christopher Plummer) tries to dissuade them from their insane scheme, on the grounds that the  odds against them are truly suicidal, Peachy dismisses his concerns with ""Well, if a Greek can do it, two Englishman certainly can !""
--The Greek in question being Alexander the Great--
And yes, women as well as men will enjoy this great film. It's a not a ""buddy movie"", it's a classic.

One so emotionally moving and involving I have a very hard time watching it, but then I likely hold the Guinness records on repeat views for Braveheart...so I tell myself I won't watch it again, but end up doing it.
Based on a Rudyard Kipling story, it is full of exotic locates, adventure, and such warm humour, under the master John Houston's direction. Houston had this in mind originally for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart (not to knock them, but total miscasting), then later was going to do it with Butch and Sundance (Paul Newman and Robert Redford in typically Hollywood style of going for names rather than perfect actors for the roles). Fortunately, Newman had the insight to pass on it and suggested going with the pairing that was absolute perfect as Danny and Peachy.
Caine had showed as Bromhead in Zulu, that he had the proper mien for a man in a red coat and pith helmet, and we know Connery can do anything given the crack. Since both are personal friends off screen, their on screen charisma comes is amplified by the fact the two men who actually like each other, giving good foundation in which to bring Danny and Peachy alive.
Danny and Peachy decide they have had enough with soldering for the British Empire and think it a marvellous idea to go forth into the world and find a forgotten corner and create their own,
and the most forgotten place they can find on the map is Kafiristan.  There they plan to become rich as kings.  It is a super adventure getting there, but after the reach the small country, the lark turns into something more, with Danny taking being King Quite serious.

This movie was made in 1975 and you do get a sense that it is not up to the current Hollywood standard in terms of special effects, Dolby surround, computer animation, and things of that nature.  Despite this the movie still stands the test of time because of excellent performances, a good storyline, and a healthy dose of humor.
First off it is based off a story by Rudyard Kipling and takes place in the hinterlands of India.  Two former English soldiers (Connery and Caine) who are basically scoundrels set out to set themselves up with fame and fortune.
They set out to the where no white men have been seen before and convince he locals they are gods.  But look out anything that is too good is probably too good to be true or to last!
Connery and Caine complement one another in this film very well I thought and again this is not a special effects flick this is shot with real backgrounds etc for the most part.  If you were ever curious to get a sense of Kipling without the book this might be a good film to check out!  It is also not terribly inappropriate for younger viewers, for example they make a promise to one another not to drink or chase women while on their quest.
It is a period piece set in the late 1800s and depicts the railroads and remote countryside of colonial India in a day when might made right and individual adventurers could achieve glory and fortune.  Or so legend would have it....",1027555200,9,1523,4.360424028268551

After running into bandits on the way, enduring freezing temperatures and with a little unintended help from an avalanche, the two meet Billy Fish who gets them set up where they would like to be in Kafiristan.  Eventually, and you can see how and why for yourself, Connery comes to be regarded by the locals as a god. This will have its advantages for Connery and Caine, but in the end will be their downfall (no pun intended for those who have already seen the film).

Here's the negative: unless anything has changed with the manufacturing of the disc itself, one has to flip the disc over about halfway through the film.  That's right.  A *and* B sides.  While I would prefer that the film be continuous all the way through, the fact that it isn't is not enough to give the DVD a negative review.
Also, there are some good extras here. There's a lot of ""on location"" and extra info about things that went on during the making of the film as well as a ""making of"" featurette (only about ten or fifteen minutes long). The featurette is nothing exceptional but it does show you what Connery landed on and how the entire cast and crew agonized over the bridge scene at the end of the film. It's also fun to see Connery sitting around in a camouflage hat on the set with the blood on his face that was so important to the story at the end of the film.

  If they made this film today . . .  it would star much younger

Almost certainly, one of those two (Crowe) would also be the Executive

our Aussie hunks largely defeating opposing armies through the strength
of their own tireless sinews.  Said scenes would also be much bloodier

The real genius behind this masterpiece is John Houston's uncanny ability to combine good old fashion swashbuckling action adventure with enough warmth and good humor, sweeping panoramas and amazing Edith Head costumes to create this marvelous fantasy.
The story begins in Rudyard Kiplings newspaper office, The Northern Star, where he is confronted by one Peachy Carnaham, (Michael Caine). Peachy retells of the amazing journey undertaken by him and fellow free mason, Daniel Dravot, (Sean Connery). Their quest was to become kings of the remote land of Kifirastan, by fighting and conquering waring tribes. In the process they end up with more than they bargined for. Through chance Daniel is perceived to be a God, which proves to be their undoing.
But the very idea of one of the characters of Kipling's story in a sense jumping off the pages and sucking him into the action and in the end revealing how Daniel came to his demise. Finally he presents Kipling, (Christopher Plummer) with a very real gold crown...proof that their amazing journey and epic tale really did take place.

The flawless performance from the entire cast, the scenery and the cinematography all go to make a movie that has grown beyond its origins in an otherwise obscure short story by Rudyard Kipling and the memoirs of an almost forgotten American adventurer. My favourite film.",984096000,,367,4.661538461538462
882131,5,6304457359,"This is by far one of the most impressive movies my eyes have ever seen.  The magnificant scope is truly amazing.  Caine and Connery live up to their names by their performances.
The two men head off to become Kings of unchartered lands.  What befalls them are humor, triumph, greed, and loss.  The individuals and circumstances the men become involved in are one of a kind.
The magic of Huston is clearly seen by the images presented on screen.  Shots that are near impossible in today's filmmaking world should be savored in this movie.  You can almost hear his booming voice giving the men advice on their roles.
As with many other films, greed does play a key factor in the shaping the Peachy and (more importantly) Daniel.  Their quest began for riches and then the tastes of power began to emerge.  Never wanting to let go or knowing when to leave becomes a dangerous issue for the two.
This is film for all to see.  My only complaint is that the DVD actually had to be turned over in the middle of the film.  This is a throwback to the early laserdisc players of the 80's.",983836800,8,1079,4.431472081218274
882132,4,6304457359,"After the amazing screen chemistry of Michael Caine and Sean Connery in this film, it's a wonder that they've only been in one other movie together in the quarter of a century since.
Caine and Connery play pals Peachy Carnahan and Daniel Dravot, a couple of British soldiers in turn-of-the-century India who go off adventuring and find themselves mistaken for gods in a tiny Asian country.  Though the men are basically buffoons, it is the relationship between them that makes the audience like them and helps turn this into a great adventure movie despite its lack of big stunts, big explosions or piles of dead bad guys at the end.
Perhaps Sir Michael and Sir Sean may be getting a little long in the tooth for something on this scale, but after seeing them play off each other in this, I'd love to see them as a pair of retired robbers on a last job or maybe even two old detectives trying to close that one nagging unsolved case.  If you watch this movie, you may start feeling the same way.",982108800,5,995,4.49171270718232
882133,5,6304457359,"""I must get a message to a man who'll be travelling through Mahbar Junction on the Bombay mail on the night of the 24th...""
With the exception of Jack Carter, Michael Caine's Peachy Carnahan has to be one of the actor's finest characterisations in cinema (Indian train passenger: ""Mr. Clatterburydas failed entrance examination, Calcutta University, 1863, a writer of correspondence for the illiterate general public"", Michael Caine: ""Shudd-uup!"")
Likewise, Sean Connery's Danny Drabot is a perfectly realised impression of ""The Man Who Would be King"". Put them both together with Chris Plummer and a Rudyard Kipling story brought to the screen by John Huston and you've got a winner.
As Peachy says: ""I've an educated taste in whisky and women, waistcoats and bills of fare. Though I've had few chances to exercise it lately. 'Cause them that govern spend all their time making up new laws to stop men like you and me getting any. And who's loss is it anyway? Why England's of course..!""

882134,5,6304457359,"This is one of my favorite films and I've owned it on VHS, Laser, and now DVD. I'm sorry to see that they cut the shot between Daniel's fall from the rope bridge and Peachie's narration to Rudyard Kipling. The scene was brief, and simply showed Daniel falling into the chasm, but that was the scene that really underscored Peachie's description of ""falling for twenty thousand miles"". They did a nice job of fading this shot out - you'd never know if you didn't remember the original movie. Oh well, I've still got the laserdisk if I want to see the true version.",974505600,3,563,4.475728155339806
882135,4,6304457359,"John Huston always wanted to make this movie and waited years for the  opportunity. I'm glad he finally did the business with it, because it's  something of a minor classic. Not a Sean Connery film. Not a Michael Caine  film. Who would have thought these two stars could successfully be cast  together. Both actors always seem to be themselves on the screen, but in  MWWBK they seem to live their roles. Neither dominates the other. Both are  indispensible. The photography is superb. Did I say four stars, very nearly  five. I'll have to watch it again.",965606400,4,554,4.708333333333333
882188,5,6304457359,"This movie is an unsurpassed, old-fashioned adventure tale about friendship, and tragic, over-reaching ambition.  As an adventure, it far exceeds the wildly more popular but childish Indiana Jones series.
This  movie follows the adventure of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two  rakish ne'er-do-wells in the British Army in India.  They leave the  service, and, alone, they pack guns and supplies and head north to  Kafiristan, a distant and mysterious land they've only heard tales about,  to become Kings, and plunder the kingdom.
When they arrive, they pit  warring communities against each other.  During battle, Connery's character  is mistaken for a god when he is shot (in his leather bandolier), and  doesn't bleed.  As a result, he is made King. He is brought to the Holy  City, where the holy men mistake him for ""Son of Sekander,"" that  is, the Son of Alexander The Great.  They prostrate themselves before him,  and give him access to Alexander's treasure, which they have guarded for  centuries.
Instead of taking the money and running, however, Connery  gets big-headed, gets to liking the role of King, and wants to stay and  administer his kingdom, which he does, and does well, it seems.
As you  would expect, that's not the end of the story...but I don't want to give  any more away.
This movie is also humorous.  It certainly isn't a comedy,  but the heroes joke with one another, and the humor arises from their  relationship, their fondness for one another, not from improbably comic  situations.
This is a grand movie that treats grand themes, and it is  worth seeing over and over again.  I can't recommend it enough.",961632000,22,1643,4.944852941176471
882189,4,6304457359,"I love this movie, and while remastering the audio would have helped (perhaps) the biggest disappointment for me was that the copy I received (and perhaps all copies?) was a flipper.

Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, of course, brilliant. John Huston  directed, so you know this ain't gonna be ""Waterworld"". The  pacing is great and the characters feel real. I think this film achieves,  in the end, more than it set out to. What starts as a nice retelling of a  Kipling short story ends up as a meditation on what it really means to live  one's life to the fullest. Strongly recommended.",958003200,7,550,4.6875
882191,5,6304457359,"Some movies take us outside ourselves, outside our world, and inside another self and another world where things are different. This film provides just that experience, with much of the credit going to the deeply  comfortable performances of Connery and Caine as buddies who come to odds  with each other and the world. If you have ever longed for adventure,  wished yourself a kingdom, or lost a friend to love or greed, then you  should find this film deeply enjoyable.",957398400,2,471,4.85
882192,5,6304457359,"This is easily one of my favorite movies. Huston takes the standard 1930s-40s ""Hollywood Empire"" movie (a la GUNGA DIN, WEE WILLIE WINKIE) and brings it up to date--to the 1880s. The true face of British  imperialism, in its good and evil, is brought to light through the actions  of two extremely human ex-sergeants in a remote Central Asian kingdom.  Connery and Caine make a terrific pair, and probably should have been  nominated (and tied) for Best Actor Oscars that year. Christopher Plummer  is good in his limited roles as Rudyard Kipling (I cannot believe that this  same guy has played Erwin Rommel, Inca Emperor Atahualpa, the Duke of  Wellington, Rudyard Kipling, AND MIKE WALLACE! ), but I should also  mention the terrific Indian actor Saeed Jaffrey, who plays the Gurkha  renegade Billy Fish (while admittedly looking more Indian than Gurkha), and  who has appeared in a number of other good movies, including GANDHI, A  PASSAGE TO INDIA, and MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE. Maurice Jarre's music is  outstanding. I can't bring myself to imagine what this movie would have  been like had Huston made it with Bogart and Gable like he intended in the  early 1950s (I love Bogart, but COME ON).",957312000,10,1199,4.900497512437811

The rest is  pure adventure as Connery and Caine search for a lost city of jewels across  land never traveled by any ""outsider"" since Alexander the Great  (hint hint).

Beautifully photographed and slyly acted, this film is an excellent, if hollow, adventure film.  Michael Cain and Sean Connery both  shine in their respective roles, though Cain's portrayal is more convincing  and real.  The dialogue is superb and the plot wholly original.  The film  is a tad simplisitc, I'm afraid, and moves too quickly for an  action-adventure, but it is on par with the great King Solomon's Mines or  the Indiana Jones Trilogy.  For those seeking an evening of  treasure-seeking and light adventure, The Man Who Would Be King is a great  choice.  Enjoy!",952646400,3,667,5.009174311926605
