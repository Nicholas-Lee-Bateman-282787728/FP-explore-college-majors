8194233,5,B000Q66Q9M,"Just fun movies without to deep a story line.  Honey is about dance, and who doesn't like to see jessica alba dance.  Josie and the pussycats is just a campy comedy but one which I have liked for years and have rewatched many times.  Blue Crush is not so much my style but but many will probably enjoy more than the other two(but I don't)",1378944000,,338,4.1692307692307695

8194235,5,B000Q66Q9M,"(This isn't *exactly* a review of the movies themselves; you can look at the IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or MetaCritic websites to view others' opinions, if you're so inclined.)

Now, to put it plainly, none of these movies are exactly ""A"" Quality. They're the sort of popcorn movies you watch with some friends, or by yourself as a sort of guilty pleasure.  That said, you watch these with a different level of quality in mind than you would for other films; the same way you would ""B-Movies,"" or horror/slasher films - whether you should do that or not is up for debate of course, but I feel if you do so, you can come away pleasantly surprised more often than disappointed.

I knew these three movies were not generally regarded as being very good, but I wanted to see them anyway; both to judge for myself, and see the work of the actors/actresses in them.

This 'Triple Feature' dvd is a great way to view these films without spending too much money, or take up too much space. Blue Crush and Honey are on the same disc with no special features, which is a disappointment, because the makers of this set could have gone the double-sided route and included the extras, the same way the makers of the Training Day/Fallen 'double feature' dvd did. Josie and the Pussycats fared much better, being a disc by itself, and includes a decent number of extras. The picture in all is good quality, and they're presented in 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.

Personally, I don't think the movies are particularly good or bad; certainly not as bad as I had heard. They were pretty fun. Mindless, bubblegum fun, but that's all I was really hoping for.

If you're willing to turn off your brain for a few hours, and were curious about these movies, give this set a try. At least it doesn't take up much room.",1239148800,6,1790,4.5607476635514015
