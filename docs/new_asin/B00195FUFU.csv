3715040,5,B00195FUFU,"A friend of mine recommended that I should watch it. I have never really been one for this genre of movies because they are usually all the same, but not this one! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time saying, ""Wait!...What?!...How did that?!...I never thought!..."" it was an excellent movie. The Actors were great, the story line was engaging, the set was truly captivating...everything about it was done really well. I highly recommend this movie!",1217203200,2,455,4.772151898734177
3715041,5,B00195FUFU,"I was very lucky to see this great new show and I definitely wasn't disappointed. An excellent plot and very catchy story line.  Great actors. Some of the scenes are quite good and will keep you glued to the screen.  Check this film out!! Good entertainment for adults, not for super young children. I Highly recommend. If we get lucky, there will be a sequel",1216857600,3,359,4.507692307692308
3715042,5,B00195FUFU,"Those lucky enough to have seen Side Sho on the Big Screen will have no problem picking up this film on it's dvd release.  Great story, action, and gore make this horror film very entertaining.",1216857600,,193,4.514285714285714
3715043,4,B00195FUFU,"If you are a fan of the Horror Genre, you must see Side Sho!

This first effort, from the team assembled by Lucky Kitty Productions, is a winner.  Side Show brings a good story to the screen with production values far in excess of the independent studio's budget.  I was pleasently surprised at how good a film could be made with limited funds.  This film deserves to be seen as I'm sure that it bodes well for Lucky Kitty's future efforts.

Side Sho. Someday, it'll be considered a Classic. See it now.",1216771200,2,503,4.423913043478261
3715044,5,B00195FUFU,"Some horror movies get so caught up in just providing gratuitous gore, they overlook that there needs to be a plot.  NOT THIS ONE!  Every element of SIDE SHO's plot creates a thread that neatly ties together at the end leaving absolutely no doubt that you've just been terrified. From getting to know the family to the unfolding evil of their ""hosts,"" SIDE SHO leads you through each scene on the edge of your seat, thinking, ""Oh my gosh! I'll never take the back roads again!""",1216771200,2,477,4.534883720930233
3715045,5,B00195FUFU,"I watched ""Side Sho"" because I knew one of the Actors in the film.  I definitely wasn't disappointed.  Some of the scenes are quite good and will stick with you days after you've seen the film.  Check this film out!!  Good entertainment for adults, not for super young children.",1216771200,3,278,4.612244897959184
3715046,5,B00195FUFU,"Wow! You gotta see this film! Action! Adventure! Romance! Blood!  Not to mention some Totally Hot Chicks!  Great Script, a wonderful ensemble cast and some scary-{BLEEP} going down.  And the guy who played The Barker is a Stud!  oh yeah that was me",1214352000,4,248,4.6976744186046515
3715047,3,B00195FUFU,"""Side Sho"" tells the story of a family (with a friend) traveling to a softball tourmament somewhere in Florida. The father is attempting to write a coffee-table book about the roadside freak shows of yester-year, and in turn, goes to an area that no-one would ever venture unless you happen to be in a Horror movie... That's basically it.
Directed by Michael D'Anna, ""Side Sho"" (spelled this way because the ""W"" fell off the crumbling sign) does not tread any new ground, but instead thrives on the campiness of B-Movies past.
The acting lacks throughout, but the cinematography looks great and showcases an authentic view of the southern backroads.
""Side Sho"" is a circus mutant freak film at heart, and nothing more. Production values appear high for such a low budget, but the story just lacks any real originality...
Perfect for a campy-fun evening's rental",1238716800,3,861,4.944827586206896
3715048,1,B00195FUFU,"This is just another quickly-made, low-budget, quirky, cheesy horror film.  Take it for what it is, and have a few laughs while watching.
The reviews that give this movie 5 stars are quite hilarious because this movie is in no way a five star movie.

Enjoy.",1224460800,4,257,4.565217391304348
3715049,1,B00195FUFU,"A family on a trip take a time-out to visit a side show because Dad needs more photos for his coffee table book.  The W is missing on the sign so they arrive at the side sho run by a creepy one-eyed barker who claims to be ancient but a close-up shows the actor playing the part is probably in his late twenties at best. to add to the laughs later in the film the family runs into a crazy woman they had met previously and she claims the barker is her pappy.

To cut to the chase after the family leaves the bogus side sho(a couple of fetus's in jars and a snake in a glass case, dad takes a wrong turn, the car runs out of gas, and soon they find themselves knee-deep in in-bred country. Not only in-bred but mutant in-bred (The Hills Have Eyes, anyone?).  The family fights back but every time they kill one of the mutants, two more show up-family kill two-three more mutants appear and etc..etc and so-on.

This film doesn't even fall into the so bad it's good category so BEWARE.  The only thing I find funny is the phony 5 star reviews written by ""plants""",1221350400,3,1060,4.176470588235294
3715050,1,B00195FUFU,"Why are there so many bad horror movies at Blockbuster? How do they even make it past the student film showcase? Side-Sho is god aweful. I don't mean the type of bad that its so bad its good (Troma), I mean the filmmakers of this movie tried so hard and they wasted good money. DO NOT BUY/RENT/OR WASTE the 1 hour 1/2 on this crapfest. It has to be a student film from some community college somewhere, because the acting is the worst and its a ripoff of every good horror movie of the past 5 years. there isn't even NUDITY to make up for any of this. there is literally ONE small boob. thats it. ONE! I'd rather watch my dying grandmother take a dump than sit through CRAP SHO one more time. The filmmakers of this movie should be literally crapped on for an 1 1/2 hours. Amateurs!",1221350400,5,782,4.22
3715051,2,B00195FUFU,"Poorly filmed, chock full of bad acting (and fat hoochies), Side Sho is a bad idea put on film. The story is a copy of ""The Hills Have Eyes"", which is part of the problem. A bunch of yuppies decide to go off the beaten path and wind up getting torn apart by mutant redneck circus folk.

The director must of used old film stock, that probably explains why this cliche riddled film is so grainy. Do yourself a favor - buy something else.",1218153600,7,436,4.190476190476191
3715052,1,B00195FUFU,"""Fake reviews from the makers of this film!"" They had hot chick's but everything else was the exact opposite of their reviews.""CHECK THE REVIEWERS OTHER REVIEWS!"" That's right folks the ones that gave it five stars only reviewed this movie. Kinda odd isn't it!? They wouldn't try to pawn this cr*p on to you would they?",1217548800,2,319,4.714285714285714
3715053,1,B00195FUFU,"Awful, awful, terrible movie.
I'd rather be waterboarded than have to watch this again.",1217462400,2,87,5.285714285714286
3715054,5,B00195FUFU,"We've all been there, on a forever long car ride with no end in site. To break the boredom you decide it's a good idea to stop at the next exit that has a cheesy billboard advertising something to see. If you have ever pulled over to see one of those small side show attractions, then count your lucky stars you made it out. After seeing this movie you won't have the guts to chance it again. From opening credits to the final screams I was perched on the edge of my seat. Great acting, a fantastic story line, outstanding visuals and a location straight out of creepy-ville will forever make this movie a classic.",1217376000,2,614,4.3478260869565215
3715055,1,B00195FUFU,"I'm not sure if some of the reviewers are friends of people involved with this film or maybe all of their mothers trying to help their career or maybe they are all the review of some lonely guy in Antartica.

 All I know is that I don't think they must have watched the same movie as I did and if that's the case, I am soooo jealous because I would love to get the time back that I spent watching it. The dialogue was forced with every line delivered including the name of the person they were speaking to, such as ""Where are we now, John?"", ""Good going, Dad"" or ""What am I doing in this movie, mommy?""
 The acting...well, it wasn't really acting and the storyline was not unique and any episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has better effects.  I really do admire low budget productions that are done really well, but this is just not one of them.",1217289600,4,847,4.24223602484472
3715056,5,B00195FUFU,"I saw this movie at the Premier in Nashville. This director is obviously a fan of the classic horror movie. All this film lacks is Bruce Campbell. No disrespect intended to the cast, who do an excellent job. Go buy it! Well worth it. I can't wait to see what he does next.

P.S.  Careful looking in those big jars. When you watch it and you will know what I mean.",1217289600,2,363,4.098591549295775

8326222,3,B00195FUFU,"Not bad movie. But they just don't make scary movies like they use to. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.
Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next. But not worth buying",1357171200,2,258,4.285714285714286

8326227,2,B00195FUFU,"A family straight out of a sixties sitcom makes the familiar cinematic mistake of taking a backroad to see the sights and end up at a fallen down sideshow full of inbred freaks who want to breed with women...ho-hum.  It's all been done before and better.
The ""acting"" is laughable; the makeup is terrible and you won't believe the ""dog/freak"".
A pretty bad movie!",1281139200,,363,4.671875
8326228,3,B00195FUFU,"Dad wants to stop at an old side show attraction in Florida and take pictures of it on the way to taking his pretty daughter along with her pretty friend to a softball tournament. Mom and son play along to keep dad happy. They all find out it's a lot more than just a harmless attraction. FREAKY PEOPLE HANG OUT THERE!!!

This ain't a bad movie. It's called Side Sho, minus the ""w"", because the Side Show sign is missing the last letter at the first of the film. The letter has either fallen off or faded out.

I swear, during the first half of the movie, all I could think about is how much the overall look of the family reminded me of just about any family in an old ABC ""After School Special"". I'm pretty sure that's the look they were going for. If that's not the look they were going for, it's the look they ended up having.

The second half of the movie really gets going with some pretty good fight scenes. I was suprised by the characters that were killed off and the ending is ironic.

The dude that played the ""Dog Thing"" is one of the greatest physical actors of all time. This alone is worth getting the movie for. A lot of people can bark or make a noise like a dog. This guy opened up and revealed his inner dog. He's more dog than man. If you think how he was moving on the ground is easy, try it yourself.",1276992000,2,1322,4.112403100775194
