6324116,4,B00J2WNULI,This film is intense with many parts that are very difficult to watch.  Unique plot and representation of a native culture.,1418342400,5,123,4.857142857142857
6324117,5,B00J2WNULI,"This is a film that is, at times, difficult to watch, due to the wrongfully inflicted punishment of a people who are threatened and beaten for simply being who they are. Actress Devery Jacobs is superb as Aila, the young, but beyond-her-years American Indian girl who has led a life of hardship, but discovers an inner strength to help her overcome adversity.

Mark Antony Krupa is the Indian agent you'll love to hate and will most likely rejoice when things come to a head at the end of the film!

I would recommend this film for 18 and over. An excellent piece of work.",1416700800,10,572,4.490384615384615
6324118,5,B00J2WNULI,"This is a film that is both painful and made me very angry to watch but at the same time it was inspiring in an odd way.  The story of Aila a young Mi'g Maq girl living on a reservation with the strength and resilience to withstand anything and come out on top.  She is struggling, life throws every obstacle it can in her way.  Kawennahere Devery Jacobs turns in an amazing performance as Aila she is definitely an actress to keep your eye on.  If ou haven't heard of her I amm sure you will soon.  I haven't seen a debut performance this riveting since Brit Marling in ""Another Earth"".  The film blends the culture if the Mi'g Maq people into the story seamlessly.  There are many parts of this film that made me very angry at the way Mi' Maq were treated.  The Indian Agent Popper in particular.  Overall the film is an exceptional debut from both director and star.  I can't wait to see what they do next.",1412121600,3,909,4.2631578947368425

Africans, remember slavery?)  Its not enough to steal lands but they must devour your soul as well?  I had to shut my feelings down, just to watch the horror and not let hate into my heart but it the end hate entered. F you queen Elizabeth and your decrees and f the catholic church for making it hell on earth for anyone who will not conform to their beliefs.

When it comes to Rhymes for Young Ghouls, perhaps the main one who leaves with your interest is Jacobs. For truly, her portrayal of Aila is something fearsome, especially when you take into consideration how she handles all that is thrown at Aila. After all, Aila is a girl who bears the weight of thinking people died because of her and somehow in Jacob's eyes you can see the weight of this guilt. Though what also makes the film and Jacobs performance something, is how brutal it is.

Such as us seeing what may likely be the lives Red Crows, and other native tribes, have on their reservations. One which drugs and alcoholism may be a troublesome force, but they don't compare to those who would attempt to erase their heritage and finish off the genocide started long ago. And while you would think only the adults would be subject to the oppression and violence, that isn't the case here. People don't remain children long and in almost every actor you can see the effect of that. For with Aila herself being punched in the face, hit with a weapon, and then stripped and nearly violated, this movie throws everything at Jacobs and company, and none of them rarely disappoint in their reactions.

Leading to perhaps the best thing about this film: It shows that, despite all that has happened, the Red Crows, and Im sure other tribes, remain resilient.

Criticism

While not a huge issue, I do feel sometimes the film was a little slow. To the point, I often found myself just pausing the movie and doing something else for a while before returning to it. With that said, though, it could just be I found it slow because I find violence so normalized that what happened in the film didn't faze me. For a normal person, though, I would expect your eyes to be glued and the shock of the films first death, and what happens thereafter, to keep you attentive until the end.

Leading to perhaps one issue that people may have problems with: there isn't any Native American, or indigenous person, who doesnt seem involved with drugs, violence or alcoholism. I mean, there are the kids, who for the most part are pure, but you don't see a lot of hope and possibility for better. Which may be an issue for someone who may want at least one positive, possibly non-problematic, portrayal of someone Native American.

Overall: Worth Seeing

Even setting aside Jacobs superb performance, what makes this film worth seeing is the rare point of view, and the fact most of the actors seemingly are of indigenous origin. Which is worth noting for seeing an indigenous actor seems extremely rare, even for roles like Tiger Lily, in the movie Pan, which youd think they would be cast in. That thought aside, the film certainly seems like a launch pad for Jacobs career and between an excellent story, great performances from all those involved, and enough shocking moments to keep a normal person glued to the screen, this should definitely be on your watch list.",1465689600,6,2958,4.664107485604607
6324154,5,B00J2WNULI,"As a Micmac (US side), I understand this film to be a dark and dreary reality, blended with fiction. The real elements: Suicide, drugs, drug dealing, Christian law destroying traditional practices, christian leaders raping our children, native artwork being done in secrecy, Alcoholism, children accidentally dying, fatherless children, etc.
 One thing you must understand, is this Jeff Barnaby's dark side, happened when he was a little boy, as he witnessed this dark time in history:
(all of the crown's guns, viciousness, and threats crashing down on his childhood)
Go on the national filmboard of Canada website and search for: The Incident at Restigouche
There, you will understand the filmmaker better
Fast forward to 2013, and it's the same crooked, horrific crap.
Go on vimeo and search for: Showdown at highway 134
You will then understand that the corn-fed pigs are still terrorizing Mi'kmaq peoples, for the crown.",1458000000,14,925,5.292517006802721
6324155,5,B00J2WNULI,"This is a great first feature-length film by director, Jeff Barnaby.  His cinematography and music are imbued with such meaning that they immediately heighten the film to the standards of the best directors of all time such as Ingmar Bergman and Spike Lee.",1455235200,2,256,4.953488372093023
6324156,5,B00J2WNULI,"Rhymes for Young Ghouls is an extremely unique period drama. It takes place in 1976 on a Canadian Indian Reservation that's situated right next to a government-mandated boarding school for young Indian children. They are sent there as little kids, stripped of all signs of their heritage (their hair is cut short and they are banned from speaking in their native tongue), and are kept there against their will until their public schooling is over. This forced culterization is further catalyzed by a nasty Catholic regimen that involves cumpulsory praying, brainwashing, and vicious beatdowns by resident nuns. If this were not harrowing enough, the school is run by diabolical agent Popper (Mark Antony Krupa), whose sole mission in life is to destroy the local Indian culture through rampant physical and emotional abuse.

The film's storyline revolves around a young Indian girl named Aila (Devery Jacobs), who grows up overnight after losing her entire family to a freak accident that sets off a heartbreaking chain reaction. In one instant, Aila's little brother gets his head crushed by a car driven by their mother, who commits suicide the next morning. Aila's father Joseph (Glen Gould) goes ballistic and is taken away in shackes after the commotion blows the cover to his household drug trafficking operation. The young girl soon joins forces with her crazy uncle Burner (Brandon Oakes) to continue in her father's footsteps in the illegal drug business. Aila's main escape is through art, and she carries around a sketchbook that blends a local folk style with dark comic book-like illustrations. The director interweaves elements of horror to communicate the visceral nature of Aila's grief, which take the form of ""visitations"" from her dead mother and brother during flashbacks and dreams. Both come to Aila as charred corpses which only she can see.

Seven years go by and Aila's dad comes home from prison and picks up right where he left off. Joseph chastizes his daughter for taking up his trade since he doesn't want Aila to end up like himself: a broken parolee on an Indian Reservation without a pot to piss in. The situation turns deadly after Joseph seeks out Popper so that he can get permission to get his fishing boat out on the lake during off-season. Popper's lackeys beat Joseph bloody, take him into custody, and force Aila into the local boarding school where her hair is cut short like a boy's. Aila soon escapes and conspires with her friends to hatch a perfect revenge plot that will free Joseph and set Popper straight once and for all. Rhymes for Young Ghouls is an excellent look into contemporary American Indian (in this instance Canadian Indian) society, a world rife with extreme poverty, substance abuse, and zero opportunities... 5 Stars.",1444867200,3,2781,5.017316017316017

6324175,5,B00J2WNULI,"Very good.  I especially liked the realistic depiction of Indian culture at that time in history.  Not a very pleasant memory
for many and tragic for what the Church and others did in their hatred of Indian culture and tradition.  It brought to mind what
the Spanish Conquistadors and their stupid priests did.  The actors were well chosen for their roles and the story moved along.
I liked the main character of the Indian girl and Devery Jacobs did a wonderful job in her role.
My only complaint would be the title and what a horrible misleading title for a great movie.",1434412800,9,572,4.578431372549019

6324177,5,B00J2WNULI,This is a sobering and disturbing movie about how Native Canadians were still being treated in the 1970's under decree of the Queen of England making it hell to be alive and Indian. The actors were excellent. The unceremonious violence that they have been dealt through the generations is brilliantly depicted. I won't forget this movie.,1432771200,10,337,5.035714285714286

8647593,5,B00J2WNULI,"Rhymes for Young Ghouls is THE MOST (what seemed to me) to be an authentic story about Native American everyday life. Yea, we all hear about the fires and ""drinking"" but which among us does not wistfully wish we were so cool so young? Is the star reALLy what age I don't know because she
has a way of talking that makes that clear.
First viewing, I didn't like the story of the wolf. Not that it mattered if well... what did it have to do with the immediate story? Now I wonder why I even wondered about that!
If this story does not have a Hollywood happy ending- it's clear in the last shot of this film that- reallY? It is a happy ending indeed!",1531958400,,647,4.142857142857143

I never want to see this happen in our present or future times or I, as well as many others, will be up in arms and put a stop to it.  It was a really great movie and I would recommend it to others.
