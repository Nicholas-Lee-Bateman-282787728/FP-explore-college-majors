1189058,4,B000005XRS,"The only true attempt of putting the classic on film with the full human spectrum of the story; humor, adventure, tragedy, and darkness. Extremely well performed, and well produced. Patrick Day IS Huck, and Samm-Art  Williams IS Jim. All the subtle humor and satire is there. Great effort,  and well worth the price.",947203200,6,316,4.943396226415095

1189065,3,B000005XRS,"This definitive version is worth all the stars it can get. But, the video transfer leaves a lot to be desired. True, it is 30 years old, but it looks like it was originally shot on film, and I had hopes the transfer would be a far cry from what we actually get to watch. A poor looking VHS quality transfer.
The night time scenes are barely discernible on my 42"" Vizio. There are no chapter or scene selction choices. It is divided into 4 episodes, each approximately 53 minutes each. But, you have to advance the film by chapters, and then manually fast forward to the appropriate episode. It is very disheartening, more care was not given to this minor masterpiece.
For a $16 film plus shipping, one would have hoped for better results.",1407542400,2,738,4.474074074074074

1189067,3,B000005XRS,I was very disappointed when I viewed this and found it wasn't all there.  I had searched for this program for years because it was the most researched and definitive version of Mark Twain's story.  Originally it aired in four 1-hour programs as a mini-series.  I cannot understand why anyone would take the time to edit out two hours of the story in stead of releasing it in a two-tape set.  It was advertised as 240 minutes in the Amazon listing.  It just wasn't so.  It's okay for anyone who doesn't know how much more there is.,1401926400,3,531,4.422680412371134

1189073,4,B000005XRS,I purchased this video to show to my classes after we finished reading Hucleberry Finn. My school's library also had a Mark Twain history that included movie clips. I was very surprised and pleased that the movie clips were from this movie! It helped tie the pre into the post readings for my students.,1365292800,,302,4.611111111111111
1189074,5,B000005XRS,"Looked everywhere for this movie. Found it on Amazon.co.uk!...on dvd! Watched this as a kid.

1189075,5,B000005XRS,"In truth I didn't love it, but I did like it almost enough. My real ranking on this would fall between 4 and 5 but I felt generous. It's a decent enough effort and is well above some of the awful treatment given Twain's characters.",1355184000,,231,4.155555555555556

1189083,5,B000005XRS,"I have been watching several different versions of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  I believe by and far this is the best of all of them with the silent 1920 version being superior to all of the ""talkies"".  My only disappointment is the entire episode with the Wilks girls was left out.  Huck hiding the gold in the casket is a must, and why American Playhouse left it out is puzzling.  I would also suggest the feud and the shooting of young Buck might be too intense for younger viewers.",1329696000,4,493,4.444444444444445
1189084,2,B000005XRS,"I will never understand Hollywood.  Here is a perfect book with perfect dialogue, and what do they do?  Change words.  Delete words.  Put words in the wrong places.  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a masterpiece for a reason, so taking any liberties with it in a film version is risky business.  Why do it?  Hollywood is full of talented people - actors, screenplay writers, directors.  Although there is beautiful scenery in this film, Samm-Art Williams does a good job as Jim, and Geraldine Page is perfect as Aunt Sally, these three pluses alone cannot carry the day.  Hollywood has yet to make a good film version of this book, and it's a mystery to me.  All they have to do is stay faithful to Twain, but for some reason they can't leave it alone.  I usually only review books and films I like, and I don't like any film version of Huck, so I suppose this is my plea to Hollywood... try again, please, but don't mess with Twain.  Stay true to the book.  We don't need caricatures of his characters, just talented actors who keep the dialogue true.  For anyone thinking of watching a film version of Huck, my advice is to get the book, curl up, and let your imagination play out the scenes.  Twain gave us a masterpiece.  Why settle for anything less?",1316304000,5,1257,4.495575221238938
1189085,3,B000005XRS,"This is one of the better adaptations of Huckleberry Finn I've seen.  As a teacher, I have been using clips from the film with our study of the book.  It doesn't match perfectly, but it is better than most.
The main problem is the quality of the DVD.  I have never seen a DVD with less features.  There is no menu screen, no scene selection screen, and the chapters are divided in strange places - often in the middle of a scene or even in the middle of a speech!  Four hours is an awful lot to fast forward through, and that's usually what I needed to do until I was familiar enough with the film to know where the scenes I needed were",1302307200,10,636,4.096774193548387
1189086,5,B000005XRS,"It's been quite a while since I read the book and watching this movie makes me want to read it again. There are several scenarios that seem to tell the reader much about Twain's viewpoints, and which I think I would more fully appreciate now.

The movie itself is difficult to fault. The portrayal of Huck is more civilized than I would expect him to be, considering his upbringing. Same with Jim. I remember when I read the book, I couldn't make head nor tail of Jim's dialogue until I read it aloud, pronouncing the ""words"" phonetically. Then I could hear what he was saying and it cracked me up.

One thing that comes through quietly but strongly is the relationship that develops between Huck and Jim, the mutual regard that tells us physical differences really mean nothing at all. I think Mark Twain must have been a man of very keen insight.",1297987200,2,848,4.5359477124183005
1189087,5,B000005XRS,"I believe I've seen every adaptation of Huckleberry Finn out there; this is the best by far. It is also the most complete and truest to the book. It even has the segment where Huck gets painted blue by rivermen from ""Life on the Mississippi,"" nicely merged into the story.

The cast couldn't be better... Patrick Day is as natural as he needs to be. Lillian Gish! She has a wonderful part as the old lady who sees through Huck's disguise as a girl. And get this: Butterfly McQueen (""Ah doan know nuthin' 'bout birthin' no babies Miss Scarlet"") has a cameo as a blind woman and Geraldine Page is memorable as the very physical and enthusiastic aunt of Tom Sawyer.

The cinematography is by the great Walter Lassally, who worked with Michael Cacoyannis - some of the shots of the Mississippi are just epic. This is a very good-looking production (filmed in Kentucky, btw).

I videotaped this when it was on PBS decades ago - I am happy to see that there are segments on this DVD that were cut from the broadcast:

- There's a graphic slave whipping/lynching scene that came as a real surprise to me
- There's some ribald choreography with the Duke and the King's on-stage performance
- Some conversational scenes with Huck and the boy he meets on the way to Aunt Sally's seem to have been cut in broadcast
- Duitto with some other scenes here and there I don't remember from the broadcast

The 214 minute running time - 3 hours, 34 minutes - sure looks complete and makes perfect narrative sense.

The DVD is bare-bones, no menus or features. It starts playing when you pop it into the player, and I think there are some newly added markings of the various ""parts"" on the bottom of the screen in white type. I don't recall it from the broadcast.

Anyway, buy this DVD with no fear. It is excellent and definitive.",1293840000,10,1811,4.486322188449848

1189089,5,B000005XRS,I got this movie as I saw the program originally on PBS. Love it! It came so quickly too. Great service and am very pleased here.,1274313600,,129,4.0
1189090,5,B000005XRS,"When this ran on PBS in 1985, I video taped the entire broadcast over four nights. Essentially, the only differences between the 240 minute version and the 213 minute version, are station breaks with members
of the cast making appearances asking for financial support for local PBS stations, and beginning and ending credits. The 213 minutes on this DVD is the full dramatic performance. I suspect it would, if
rated, probably be PG . No, it is not suitable as entertainment for preteens, but then neither is Twain's novel. What it is, however, is a magnificent piece of cinematic art, which, coincidentally, happens to follow Twain's story quite faithfully.",1267920000,43,658,5.045871559633028
1189091,5,B000005XRS,"This version follows the book most closely, though it does leave out a major section toward the end of the book, and the pacing toward the end seems a bit truncated making the end when it comes more abrupt than one would wish. Nevertheless it's the best video version of Twain's great novel available.",1267574400,3,301,4.592592592592593
1189092,2,B000005XRS,"When I purchased this dvd I had read a review saying that this version was the closest to the book version out there. I guess my mistake was that I hadn't actually read the book in it's entirety, which I intend to do now. When my husband and I finished the movie we decided not to keep it. It is not the wholesome movie we thought it might be. Of course we realize... how wholesome is a life like Huck Finn's to start with anyway? We aren't blind to that fact. We just know that if we had children of impressionable ages around wanting to watch movies and they said, ""Hey... The adventures of Huckleberry Finn... can we watch that one?""..... that we'd say... ""NO!!!"" Anyone considering getting this movie should really think about what values you personally are trying to instill within your family, and hold to them. This movie certainly does not do that for you.",1261526400,2,864,4.474683544303797
1189093,5,B000005XRS,"This is the best version of Huck Finn that I have seen. Very, very well worth the money. Patrick Day's portrayal of Huck is simple (as it should be) and real. As is also Samm-Art Williams portrayal of Jim. This version follows the book better than any of the others. This is the full version.",1253232000,3,292,4.327272727272727
1189094,1,B000005XRS,"The 1939 version starring Mickey Rooney or the 1960 version starring Mickey Shaughnessy and Tony Randall are much better and more humorous than this version; and are 4-stars.

In this 1-star version, Huckleberry Finn and the other characters have no personality. This version has no humor. This version is painfully slow with some exceptionally bad acting. A boy, Ben, has just seen his father and brothers killed and tells Huck as if he was talking about the weather. The only positive thing I can say, is there was some nice scenery. The other two versions have more story in less time.

If you want to write a school report without reading the book, then this version follows the book, and would be better. The people rating this 5-stars must be praising it for that reason or selling it. I have been ripped-off again by shill-reviews.

""Tom Sawyer"" 1939 with Tommy Kelly is better than all versions of Huck Finn.

Other great period, adventure movies are ""Tom Brown's School Days 1935"", ""David Copperfield 1940 & 2000"", ""The Prince & the Pauper"", ""At Swords Point 1952"", ""Oliver Twist-1948 version with John Howard Davies as Oliver"", and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel 1935"".",1235088000,7,1171,4.898989898989899
1189095,4,B000005XRS,"The DVD was a great addition to the book. I teach Special Education at the high school level. We read the book and I was looking for a DVD that was as close to the actual text as possible (some things were omitted for time). This DVD did not let me down. Be warned the language may offend some, but it is true to the book. The actors portrayal of the characters was done well. I would recommend this DVD.",1234224000,10,404,4.0625
1189096,5,B000005XRS,It is a fantastic flim they don't make pictures like this any more or its hard to find good pictures like this around i would recommend this to any one,1234137600,5,151,4.066666666666666
1189097,5,B000005XRS,"How I missed this in 1985, I'll never know! It was a TV miniseries, filmed in Kentucky and shown on PBS. A shortened version was aired on a cable channel recently and I caught the last half of it, checked the Internet and was amazed to find it available in its full length on DVD.

For anyone who hasn't seen it, this is the only film version of Mark Twain's classic that is true to the book, and it requires the production's full 3 hours and 33 minutes to accomplish this admirable task. The actors were well chosen, with the possible exception of Tom Sawyer, who didn't seen ""right"" to me. Never mind, he's only a bit player in Huck's story, and the rest of the principals do a fine job. Patrick Day is especially appealing in the title role. All the background, the land and water, the buildings, boats, and townspeople are exactly as you've seen them in your mind's eye when you read the book. I was amazed by this movie's completeness and its fidelity to Twain's work.

If you have seen this production on TV you'll find this DVD quite acceptable though not real sharp. I noticed some grain in dark areas and a bit of edge ghosting in a few contrasty scenes. The aspect ratio is standard TV, 1.33:1. The sound is fine, although I had to turn my set's volume up.

There is so much to see and discover in this masterpiece, I'm sure that I'll watch it again and again and find something new to delight me every time. I could not recommend it more enthusiastically. All other versions of Huckleberry Finn pale to the ridiculous by comparison.",1219622400,26,1543,4.426056338028169
1189098,5,B000005XRS,"This is by far the best version of Huckleberry Finn.  I've tried for the past 5 months to find this in DVD format in it's 214 minute glory, and finally have found it from Monterey Media.  This version holds true to the book in it's unedited version and surpasses any other Huck Finn version in existance.  I wish that the now defunct American Playhouse would have made Tom Sawyer to compliment this video.  Maybe one day someone will.",1175990400,47,434,4.5256410256410255
1189099,4,B000005XRS,"Content of this film is better than any other Huck Finn version.  Aside from just a few scenes, the film is really true to the original text novel.  The only thing that is a pain is that the dvd has no chapter or scene separations.  Showing it to high school classes is difficult due to the constant rewinding and fast forwarding to find where we left off.",1174435200,28,356,4.2835820895522385
1189100,4,B000005XRS,"After watching the Ken Burn's documentary on Mark Twain's life, I looked forward with much anticipation to seeing this film. It was supposed to be a great social commentary about slavery and on the conflict between the Constitution and the reality of slavery. It was supposed to be a kind of mental journey that the viewer took by following the simple logic of a boy, who represented the ideas about black people from that time. And while the movie does repeat all the right lines, ""Well, then, I'll go to hell"" it doesn't do so with as much power as Ken Burns narrator did. It doesn't set up the real and present tension -- the level of religious faith at that time and just what Huck meant -- how powerfully people of that day feared doing what was wrong and how Huck was meant to really feel it was wrong to help Jim escape.
The power of the soul-searching aspect of the book is really hard to capture on film. It's a good film, as it goes, but I had hoped for something explosive.",1017705600,12,984,4.353260869565218
1189101,4,B000005XRS,"Of all the many movie versions of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"", this PBS adaptation is the best.  It remains true to Twain's story, though does not incorporate the entire book, for time constraint I suppose.  However, enough of the book has been adapted to give the viewer a very good idea of what the book is all about.  Patrick Day is by far the best of all the Huck Finn's I have seen, thus far.  The actor who portrays Jim is outstanding; as is the acting from the Duke and the King.  Also, the scenery is breathtaking.  It is truly a joy to watch this movie version of Huck Finn, though apparantly it has been edited, and some of it has been taken out.  If you can, buy the version that has the complete four hours - I gauruntee you will not be sorry.  I strongly recommend this movie for everyone.",990576000,38,811,4.2894736842105265
1189102,5,B000005XRS,"My favorite version of Huck Finn will probably always be the Elijah Wood version. It took the original story and sped it up. It's non-stop adventure, with everything else you want from the story included as well. This version however, is not far behind while at the same time being very true to the book. Now the version you see here is the one I saw, I rented it just last night. But there is a version twice as long that is also available here on Amazon. The price is ridiculous since it is NOT a DVD, but rather two tapes, but I want it anyway! I can only assume that it includes everything this one left out, though this version is still fine in a pinch! Even with half of it's running time cut out it's the second best version of Huck Finn I've seen! The casting is great! Only exception is Tom. I mean, he wasn't bad, but didn't look quite as roguish as you'd expect. For a great Tom see Rascals and Robbers. Some of the acting is a little odd, and some is great! And I have to comment on the kid who plays Huck, a grown man by now I'm sure. He's the PERFECT Huck, and would have also played a perfect Young Indiana Jones had he had the chance! I mean he has the look and the act. There's one seen where you totally see his Harrison Fordishness come out at the end as he snaps at Tom and breaks down a door to free Jim! You fellow Tom and Huck fans, be sure to get this one, the long version if you can afford it, and remember to look for what I said, his extreme Indiana Jonesishness. Indy fans like me, though we loved Flannery's Indy, will weep at the fact that this kid didn't have his turn at the hat!",987120000,15,1612,4.072327044025157
