8218005,5,B00006CXHO,"This is definitely one of my favorite movies. It was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and I've seen A LOT of movies! Daniel and Miriam were so perfect together. It was so heartwarming... so incredibly sweet and funny. I must have watched it AT LEAST 10 times. You HAVE to see it.
Daniel Wu's character is a multilingual, highly educated, wealthy adopted son of an ex-triad member. Miriam's character is a rookie police officer assigned to the lost property department because of her lack of skills but then is assigned an undercover job. Her undercover job was to listen in on one of Daniel's meetings with a client to see if he was involved in any illegal activities. She gets hurt, he comes to her rescue and her temporary undercover job is extended so she can get closer to him. The plot becomes predictable but the genuine attraction between the two and the humor that evolves form the web of lies more than makes up for the plot. Also, 'Love Undercover 2' also just came out in the theatres in China so I'm just waiting for the DVD version! And I also heard that they will start filming another sequel in June of 2004. Can't wait!",1060214400,,1154,4.44811320754717

the characters are easy to follow and add to the humourous addictive plot!
it's about a police trainee (miriam) who fails in everything so she gets demoted to being in the ""lost property"" department. the police sign her to being an undercover agent *hence the title* because if she dies they have nothing to lose *she has no family, no boyfriend, no pets, no home*.
Their target is the son of a rich triad *or something* and a little accident causes the son (daniel wu) to fall in love with her. Of course..the funny thing is..she's pretending to be a waitress and as he slowly falls for her she has to keep her indentity *which is pretty hard comsidering she's a bit dense*
the plot is a bit obvious, but the jokes inbetween and all the sweet scenes between miriam and daniel's character makes it all up!!",1029283200,,898,4.4156626506024095
