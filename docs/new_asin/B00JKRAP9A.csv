6373373,3,B00JKRAP9A,"There's no doubt the music is as usual, highly enjoyable. However, the editing is weird. It's a concert from 3 or 4 locations pieced together. It seems really odd and distracting because the location keeps changing and the resulting acoustic varies. It's not the best of Andre's concert recording and this feels like it is a gap filler before the next (big) disc is out. While the concert is fun to watch, this isn't a very strong release.",1410652800,,439,4.641025641025641

6373391,4,B00JKRAP9A,"I didn't realize this was a compilation of musical tunes from Andre Rieu & his Johann Strauss Orchestra performances over the past 10 years or so.  It's good DVD, but I wish the package notes would tell you which performance the song was performed in.",1416441600,5,251,4.5777777777777775
6373392,4,B00JKRAP9A,"Be aware that if you are a huge Andre Rieu fan like I am and have most of his DVDs, all of the selections on this disc are from his previous concerts; none are new. Two performances that immediately come to mind are ""Live at Radio City Music Hall"" and ""Live from Maastricht."" I'm a little like Pavlov's dog who hears a bell and immediately looks for a biscuit. When I see a new Andre Rieu DVD cover on Amazon I automatically click on the ""Add to Cart"" button. Halfway through this ""Magic of Musical"" disc I realized all of the selections were from earlier DVDs in my library. That's not to take away from the quality and content of the this DVD, however. If you enjoy the popular movie selections from Rieu's past performances, this DVD will allow you to enjoy them one after the other. But I'm still going to subtract one star because I initially thought I was getting a new concert devoted to musical numbers.",1415577600,15,911,4.396449704142012
