8427051,2,B004EJR06U,Not worth the money! Jillian Micheals videos are way better! I didn't even break a sweat.  This is not a good workout video and is not a good compliment to the book! Don't waste your money!,1359936000,,189,4.25
8427052,5,B004EJR06U,A friend of mine was doing this diet and told me about it which prompted me to order the e-book and then order this workout video.  The video is great.  I highly recommend it!  Can't wait for the results!!,1358985600,,205,4.205128205128205

8427056,2,B004EJR06U,"Bought both the DVD and the book.  Absolutely loved the book and have lost 23 pounds in three months.  The video is a different story.  It jumps from one exercise to the next with minimal repetition. Also, did not care for the cuing. I tried playing it a number of times and ended up buying other exercise videos.",1296432000,76,313,4.362068965517241
