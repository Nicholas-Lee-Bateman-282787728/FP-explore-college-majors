391910,4,6301935047,Story was good and was on spot about how a romance between and older woman and younger man was treated at the time.  It was a good story and was told well.,1404691200,,155,3.84375
391911,5,6301935047,"Good romance movie. Tearful at times but overall good. Rita Moreno is spectacular in this role. What's a mother to do when her best friend is sleeping with her son? If you're in the mood for a good romance movie, this is it. Forbidden love at its fullest!",1374537600,,255,4.333333333333333
391912,5,6301935047,I saw this movie in my early twenties and the title song moved me so much. I would like someone to tell me who sang the song if possible. I've never forgotten it. It was so hauntenly beautiful.,1300060800,2,193,4.105263157894737

391914,5,6301935047,"I found this film to be poignant and moving with the subject matter being the relationship (in 1979) between a 40+ woman (Susan Flannery) and a 20 something young man (Jameson Parker).  In today's 'enlightened' society people would not find it unusual but back in the late '70's (I know, I remember them fondly) it was frowned upon; family members, friends and other interested parties where aghast at the 'horror' of what the woman was doing - seducing a man young enough to be her son (in fact it was the other way round).  In truth it was nobody else's business but the 2 people involved.  Suffice to say that everyone chooses to go their separate ways at the end except for Jameson Parker's character Ed Taggart who has no choice but to go back to school when Flannery's character tells him, in a lonely motel room that it would never work.  After the tumultuous love affair he is bereft, naturally, and as he realises he is losing the love of his life the sob in his voice coupled with his tears had such an impact, it was heartbreakingly sad to watch.

Jameson Parker is such a fine, fine actor - he never, ever turned in a bad performance in any of his movies and TV shows.  He is absolutely believeable as the heartbroken young man who has no choice but to accept things and move on even though he doesn't want to.  He makes acting any emotion look easy and I know from experience just how hard it is to create that.  To say Jameson Parker is a great actor is to not do him justice - he is awesome in every sense of the word, so much so, that I know when I see his name in a movie that it is definitely one to watch - thank you sir for making this one unforgettable.",1190332800,10,1674,4.2586750788643535

7818458,3,6301935047,"While this was a ok movie clearly shot for TV, the subject matter is still treated with weary eyes.
This is really not about the older woman - younger man portion of the story but a friends child.
While the music makes you want to see this as a love story, the young man seduced a lonely woman.
And sadly like a lot of lonely people who also seek companionship, she found it with a friends son.",1486425600,,394,4.12987012987013

7818462,4,6301935047,"There was no seduction at all in this film.  Only some profoundly absurd  ageism involved in this movie from those gone prematurely senile and those who had yet to grow up at all.  Reminded me of the classic geriatric couple each of whom took up with youngers with the female saying to the male ""20 goes into 60 more times than 60 goes into 20"".  It isn't only that the ageist homosexually regimenting ""schools"" effectively trash the lives of humans during decades of their lives leading to a 57% divorce racketeering outcome for their hetero relationships nearly all of which are ""close age"" attempts.  It is also that widely separated ages of the partners are more beneficial for both sides of the pretended ""age gap"" avoiding the all to usual ""too much in common"".  The script writers were,however, intent on enforcing ageist destruction via proposing ""dropping out of school"" and the programmed absurdity of felonious enslavement by the young male not yet old *enough* to understand either of those absurdities nor even the felony religionist demand that heteros *must* ""have children"".  In the subject relationship, the older participant stated the relevant ""thank you"" and the ageist antagonisms got resolved.  It was a well produced exploration of the impacts of ageism on human relationships.",1475884800,,1300,5.070422535211268

I'd forgotten how quaint and innocent it felt to take someone right up to the gate at LAX, oh those were the days.  Guess I'll now try to dig up some McMillian & Wife, McCloud and Columbo episodes.....  or maybe Tom and Rudy Jordache in Rich Man, Poor Man.....",1473379200,,387,4.408450704225352

7818467,4,6301935047,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I would have given it 5 stars had the ending differed. It is, I believe, an accurate portrayal of the experience of a man and woman who find love with each other, and who are separated by age. In our politically correct culture, we have succeeded somewhat in reducing discrimination due to racial differences and gender differences. However, when it comes to age differences, there has been little or no progress. And this is reflected in the movie, in the reactions of all the people closest to Maggie (Susan Flannery) and to Ed (Jameson Parker, I believe). When Ed's mom, and Maggie's X-husband and teen-age son, learn that Maggie and Ed are in love, to use a cliche, 'all hell breaks loose.' Age discrimination is so rampant in this country, and I am probably one of the few who do not understand why this discrimination is allowed to continue unbridled. In the movie Maggie, after experiencing the brunt of the negative bias of her son and Ed's mother (her 'best friend'), is influenced to end the love relationship, the one pertinent example given is that Ed may want to have children one day and she will likely be unable (due to age) to bear HIS children. There are, of course, several options (one example is adoption) but none of this is explored. The relationship simply ends quickly largely due to the discrimination that has been experience by close family (and x-family) members, and anticipated discrimination of others in the future (friends, co-workers, etc.). There is, in my opinion, little difference between racial discrimination that has been experienced among mixed-race lovers, and that experienced by lovers whose age difference does not fall within 'the norm.' I wonder if this discrimination will ever end in the USA. I am aware that the people of some countries are not as hung-up on age differences as we in the USA. Anyway, I would have liked the end to explore some of this further, and for the couple to have been successful in their relationship IN SPITE OF the discrimination exhibited by others. Nevertheless, a good movie. I recommend it.",1463961600,,2105,4.833795013850415
