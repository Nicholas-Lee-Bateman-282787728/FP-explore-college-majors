6349428,3,B00JA3RPAG,"Three Days to kill is about a CIA agent who is forced to retire because he has cancer.  With only months to live, he then goes to Paris and tries to reconnect with the family he lost.  Then one day, a CIA agent recruits him for one final mission.  As an added incentive, she claims to have an experimental drug which can help him live longer, so he may be able to spend more time with his family.

The film starts quickly and looks like it is going to be an action packed thriller.  It was very promising.  Then, all of a sudden, the story gets confusing and just falls flat.  Too many stories are blended together.  He is trying to be an assassin and father at the same time.  By the end, you wish the writing had been more solid.  This film could have been great.  As it is, the film is just average.  It's very predictable.

It's too bad the script was poor, because the acting was above par.  Kevin Costner is very believable in his role.  Amber Heard continues to impress me with the variety of roles she has taken.  I never would have expected her to play a cold blooded CIA agent as well as she did.  They are the reason this film is watchable.

I rate this film three stars.  It's okay to watch it once as a rental.",1399680000,8,1223,4.14957264957265
6349429,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Went to see this in the theaters, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It switches from over-the-top (and a little offbeat) action / violence to sly humor on a dime.  It's sort of a character study of an aging CIA operative suffering from inoperable cancer.  The basic plot is simple.  Do one last job for a chance of receiving an experimental drug that may save his life.  The protagonist's best days are clearly behind him, yet he's still no one to mess with.  And being an operative, his family life has suffered, especially the relationship with his daughter.  Knowing his days are numbered, he tries to reestablish that relationship.  Some of the best moments involve this attempt and helps to insert the right amount of humor at often unusual and critical times.

I have always gravitated to this type of movie.  Serious at times, but offbeat with surprising humor at other times.  Joss Whedon (no he didn't direct this) is famous for this type of flavor.  Whedon's Firefly, Serenity and The Avengers come immediately to mind.

Between 1 and 10, I give ""3 Days to Kill"" a solid 8 (or a 4-star rating).  Looking for something a bit different with some aptly applied humor to break the tension?  This film fit the bill for me.  I'll be happy to add this movie to my blu-ray collection.

After viewing the blu-ray:  For picture and sound quality, Oblivion is my reference blu-ray.  That being said, here are my thoughts on 3 Days to Kill:

Picture quality:  8 out of 10 -- very good to excellent, but had a couple of minor problems with some of the editing choices.
Audio quality:  8 out of 10 -- A surprising bass monster (rattled everything in sight) and in general very good throughout, although a bit exaggerated in certain scenes.",1399593600,43,1754,4.626623376623376
6349430,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I have seen this three times now and each time gets better and better. I love the concept of this movie about a CIA agent dying and having to step aside important assignments.  Along comes a sexy, dominatrix type agent who can make Ethan's life go on so that he may reconnect with his wife and daughter. The action is thrilling and suspenseful; the story is heartwarming and you are rooting for the good guys through it all.  Kevin Costner makes this worth while and Hailee Steinfeld is a great little actress who will go far.  Ignore critics, buy 3 Days to Kill, have a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.",1398556800,91,597,4.409090909090909
6349431,4,B00JA3RPAG,I watched this movie in the theatre and was very surprised on how much I liked it. I found it to be very entertaining.,1398297600,6,118,3.9583333333333335
6349432,2,B00JA3RPAG,"Good old French action cinema from the mind of Luc Besson. After years of exposure to American action movies that used to be really good and have since gone special effects heavy and lost the heart, watching a Besson movie is weird to say the least. While it has been years since American action movies remembered how to make audiences care, the French are at least trying; although frequently missing the mark.

In ""Three Days to Kill"" things start off with a bang as we are introduced to Ethan Renner, a hitman who believes he has a cold. As the action explodes and we witness great direction from McG who knows how to choreograph a great action sequence, Renner falls short of accomplishing his goal; blacking out and awakening in a hospital. There he is told that he is dieing. This is where the heart of this action movie is inserted because Renner left his wife and daughter 5-years prior because of his dangerous career. With his life known to be short, Renner immediately goes to France to make things right with his life, wife and daughter.

Theres a lot going on in ""Three Days to Kill"". Within the first thirty minutes we are exposed to what we think may be an action movie and then it becomes a drama and then the two collide to become a comedy. Its a typical Luc Besson formula and I found this to be similar to 2013s Deniro movie ""The Family"" in which Besson wrote and directed himself. Its a difficult thing for a director and movie to bounce back and forth between such extreme moods and it worked much better in ""The Family"" than ""Three Days to Kill"". Although, had it not been somebody like Kevin Costner in the lead role, this movies weird mood swings would have been even more disastrous. Costner, somehow, makes most of it work.

Theres a point toward the end of ""Three Days to Kill"" where I was awoken from my boredom; not by a great action sequence, but a great moment between father and daughter. I was actually ready to give a positive markup to the movie, despite some slow moments and some uninteresting writing. Before I could make it to the credits though, the biggest flaw in most French movies reared its ugly head; an illogical, coincidental, silly, just to setup the finale prom date that I won't elaborate upon. Apparently, in French action movies, you don't have to explain everything. You just have to finish with bang; regardless of how ridiculous it is.",1398297600,5,2391,4.568764568764569
6349433,4,B00JA3RPAG,"""3 Days to Kill"" is an intriguing if uneven spy thriller starring Kevin Costner.  Costner is Ethan Renner, an aging CIA agent who learns at the end of a botched operation that he has terminal brain cancer.  Renner returns to Paris for an awkward reunion with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielson) and daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld).  However, the CIA isn't quite finished with Renner.  Vivi Delay (Amber Heard), the rather exotic agent who has picked up the botched operation, knows Renner is the only person who can identify an illicit WMD dealer known as the Wolf.  She offers him an experimental drug for his cancer, in return for just one or two more little jobs...

The movie is an odd mixture of elements.  The core of the movie is a string of extremely well-staged action sequences. In between is the family drama of Renner's reconnection with a rebellious daughter, parts of which ring true; the sometimes laugh-out-loud humor of Renner's dealings with the string of suspects who will lead him back to the Wolf; and his evolving relationship with the African family that has squatted in his apartment. The location shooting in Paris is quite good.  There is a strong element of betrayal built into the story; it is unclear right to the end who Renner can trust or how things might, or might not, work out for him.  Recommended as an afternoon's entertainment if the viewer is a Costner fan.",1396051200,56,1408,4.785123966942149
6349434,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Ethan (Kevin Costner) has sacrificed his relationship with his family to be a super spy for the CIA. On his most recent assignment he was to kill ""The Albino""  (Tomas Lemarquis) while Vivi (Amber Heard) was to kill the Wolf (Richard Sammel).  Ethan breaks down as his brain cancer has entered his lungs. He is given 3-5 months to live.

Ethan returns to his Parisian apartment only to discover a poor family of squatters from Africa living there with the police unwilling to evict them.  He attempts to reestablish his relationship with his estranged wife playing the death card and that of his daughter, by not telling her.

Vivi shows up with an experimental drug that may work, but in doing so he must renege on his promise to his wife and kill ""The Wolf"" as he is the only man who has seen him. Ethan now attempts to re-establish his estranged relationship with his moody teen daughter while trying to kill the world's most wanted man...and on occasion using parenting advice from people he is attempting to extract information.

I love a film that shows originality and good dialogue. Amber Heard played a great, even if unrealistic, femme fatale noir. The film breaks from the formula of utilizing the daughter as an asset.  It is a funny heartwarming action film.  Something for everyone.

6349457,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Review of 3 Days to Kill
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18. 2017

A terminally ill former CIA agent is given one last assignment in exchange for an experimental hallucinogenic drug that may extend his life, and he struggles to reconnect with his teenage daughter with the time he has left.

I know what you're thinking: this is a Nicolas Cage action movie. Youre right. In Matchstick Men, Stolen, and Rage, Nicolas Cage has to bond with/rescue his teenage daughter. In Gone in Sixty Seconds, Stolen, and Rage, Nicolas Cage comes back for just one more job. In Bringing Out the Dead, Nicolas Cage hallucinates over the course of three days. And in Dying of the Light, Nicolas Cage plays a CIA agent dying of a terminal illness.

One more: In Drive Angry, Cages costar is Amber Heard, and he has three days to complete his mission. Kevin Costners costar in 3 Days to Kill is Amber Heard. And as is evident by the title, he has three days to complete his assignment.

So, yes, youve seen this movie before. And during every since scene, you're keenly aware that Nicky Cage could have played the Kevin Costner role. However, with the well-known plot and without Nicky Cage, this is still a very entertaining movie!

Kevin Costner is very likable, and there are several hilarious scenes in which hes torturing someone or about to kill someone but is interrupted by his daughters embarrassing I Dont Care ringtone and has to juggle playing Daddy and being an assassin. The action scenes are exciting and sometimes cringe-worthy (in a Shes going to get decapitated; I cant look! way), but thankfully the movie stays away from blood and guts. Its really very good, and I recommend it for those who like a little humor in their action flicks. Amber Heard got on my nerves a little, but only because she had a major attitude problem and wore black leather corsets for absolutely no reason. But all in all, her part is small, and Kevin Costners parental charm more than made up for it.",1498089600,,1964,4.632183908045977

Truly a mess that somehow achieves some focus by way of the lead, Kevin Costner. He has A- list presence, but seems to inhabit D list films. How does such a star with such aura wind up in films like this? He has that ineffable ""something"".  Not sure if I would have paid to see this, but should it show up free later on, it's worth recommending. There's surely sad story behind this.",1496534400,2,551,4.247619047619048

It should Really be dark.
Instead its actually rather amusing seeing a hard boiled killer trying to balance his time between dealing death (wholesale) and trying to keep up with his teenage daughter. (The latter being the greater challenge, apparently.)

Maybe there was some grand reason for killing a lot of people that was revealed later in the movie.

Kevin Costner plays CIA agent who after 30+ years of service is a machine killer hunting down bad guys all over Europe.  Once he finds out he has not much time left in this world and especially not as a CIA agent, he chooses to finally reunite with his wife and daughter who live in Paris.  The family has been estranged by his international trips and secret life and before long, our agent learns that sometimes dealing with teenage daughter can be more challenging than dealing with world's most notorious characters.

So it starts the game of cat and a mouse with lots of killing, fist fighting and the usual stuff.  You will want to watch this movie to the end for only one reason.  You will want to find out what finally kills this agent (played by Kostner): terrorists, bad guys, cancer or his daughter...

6349746,4,B00JA3RPAG,"The film has a promising opening sequence............
The film really starts with C.I.A. Agent 'Ethan Renner'(Kevin Costner)being told he has just a few months to live.
He decides he wants to make up for lost time by living in 'Paris' where estranged wife 'Christine' (Connie Nielsen)
and daughter 'Zooey' (Hailee Steinfeld) who he'd been away from for the past five years, absent husband absent
father.
He is approached by Agent 'Vivi Delay' (Amber Heard) who offers him a life-saving experimental drug in exchange
for his services, of course there is a large wad of cash involved, which 'Ethan' see's as some security for his
daughter, though initially reluctant, the carrot offered is just too good to pass up.
'Ethan' is a very efficient operator, he's good at what he does for the Agency, he kills.
The prime targets for 'Ethan' is the 'Albino' (Tomas Lemarquis) who he'd encountered on an earlier mission and 'The
Wolf' (Richard Sammel)
The drug that has been given to 'Ethan' has it's side-effects, 'Vivi' tells him that the effects will level out by drinking vodka.
'Vivi' tells 'Ethan' that the job now has to be completed in just three days.
In between 'Ethan' try's to understand and get to know his daughter 'Zooey' whilst 'Christine' is away for a few days, and
when he's not, he's trying to extract the information that will lead him to the targets.
'Ethan' does have concerns that his daughter may be used to get to him which leads to him being very protective of her.
As the temperature and pace rises the body-count begins to stack up as he closes in on the terrorist targets 'The Albino'
and 'The Wolf.
(The extended version adding just 5 minutes to the run-time)
Must admit because of both critics and reviewers not really rating the film, my expectations despite having already bought
it, was indeed pretty low.
'Ethan' does have a way of getting attention i must say.....
The film tells the story of 'Ethan' getting to know his estranged daughter whilst trying to fulfil the task he's being paid to do.
The film does have several good action sequences as well as a good measure of humour along the way, perhaps a little
disjointed at times in the effort to follow the two story lines.
However, because my expectations weren't high, the film was a whole lot better than expected.

Costner gets parenting advice from everyone he tortures so he can make up for being an absent father to his sixteen year old daughter in 72 hours while being secretly coerced into killing a half dozen people by a random woman claiming to be a CIA agent.  She extorts his cooperation by offering him a cure for the cancer that is killing him.

There are some truly excellent actors who waste their talent on the terrible piece of garbage.  I hope it serves to launch a career or two, otherwise, this movie was a waste of everyone's time.  I should have watched ""Sharknado"" instead (also available on Netflix).",1435795200,,862,4.594771241830065
6349748,5,B00JA3RPAG,"Fun to watch again and again.  Typical Costner humor, and with some good action.",1435276800,,80,4.714285714285714

6349750,3,B00JA3RPAG,OK movie.  Not his best work but still worth watching,1435190400,,53,4.3
6349751,3,B00JA3RPAG,Not one his best.,1434931200,,17,3.5
6349752,4,B00JA3RPAG,"First, don't let Kevin Costner in the lead role put you off. The script centers on a befuddled superspy (see the movie's own description). Normally the combination of ""befuddled"" and ""superX"" results in simply a stupid, bad movie. Here it works, largely because of Costner--because this is his normal (only?) character, the audience expects this of him and you don't see any artifice or see him working at it.

I probably would have given up on this movie in the first few minutes if I hadn't been told ""It's so bad that it's good."" If you aren't paying attention, the script seems to be little more than the result of a dysfunctional committee of chemically-addled hack writers. But then I realized that it lacked the randomness to be unintentionally bad. For example, the pacing of moving from absurdity to absurdity was too tight. And many of the bad choices were so inexplicably bad that it was hard to accept them as mistakes or incompetence.

Instead, I came to view this as a very tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre. While the movie maintains the illusion of being a serious movie by not indulging in the typical aspects of parody (example, overly broad performances, stretched out scenes), it is so consistently absurd that it is hard to think that it isn't a parody--and that conflict/ambiguity is part of the movie's entertainment value. The movie kept me involved by constantly shifting between disparate elements of parody. It has some blatant reference to other movies, for example, Costner's signature scene in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard/dp/B002R5QPRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard</a>"". It has standard elements of the genre taken to absurd levels. It has standard elements inserted in the ""wrong"" way. It jumbles up elements from different subcategories of the genre. And it occasionally drops into the surreal.

Make no mistake: This is not a good movie in the conventional sense. But if you are in the right mood and/or with the right group of friends, it can be a very entertaining movie.

6349839,3,B00JA3RPAG,"This is a strange but sometimes entertaining mishmash.  Costner plays Ethan Renner, an ageing CIA operative who has developed a bad cough.  The cough is actually being caused by a brain tumor that has spread to his lungs.  His would-be CIA handler, Vivi Delay, offers him access to an experimental drug that might just put him in remission.  The cost: he must find and kill a baddy called the wolf.

Meanwhile, in the subplot which often becomes the main plot, Ethan is attempting to reconnect with his daughter Zooey.  Zooey is a teenager who is going through that periods awkwardness.  In particular, she is having difficulty being the perfect girlfriend to a young man named Hugh (whose family connections will result in a grandly implausible ending).

Note that after an initial sequence in Belgrade the story transpires in Paris, so we reap the benefit of iconic settings as backdrops for shootouts and car chases.  Zooey is played by Hailee Steinfeld, who played Mattie Ross in the True Grit remake.  Ms. Vivi is played by Amber Heard.  Dressed in tight black garments that accent her striking blond hair, Vivi takes an occasional puff on a single cigarette before casting it aside and popping bad guys in the head with her 9.

At first the movie felt like a Steven Seagal film, where the single star is surrounded by local actors and carries a film punctuated by a handful of action sequences, but this film has relatively high production values and a reasonably interesting cast.  The best scenes are indeed those action sequences, where KC utilizes a lifetimes worth of CIA skills to take out roomsful of opposition muscle.  The intervening family scenes, however, are long and slow as, e.g., KCs learning the ways to marinate and cook tuna or teaching his daughter (many years later than usual) to ride a bicycle.

The result of the scene jostling is that the resulting mishmash is a little bit of James Bond, a little bit of Father Knows Best, a little bit of clock-ticking noir, a bit of a Parisian travelogue and what might have been a very bad first draft of a Michael Crichton medical thriller.  The problem is that whenever KC gets his shots he is subject to hallucinations.  These occur, consistently, right at the moment when he finds himself in a final confrontation with his adversary.  Ready to pull the trigger, he suddenly falls to the ground and drops his gun as the world swirls around him.  Earth to Vivi: he has 3-5 months to live.  Put the big needles in a safe place; guarantee Ethan the access to them and then let him go after the wolf.  As soon as he takes him out he can go to some Swiss retreat with his wife and daughter at his side and calmly take his meds.

For all that, the movie is really action/adventure melodrama and who can resist a man reconnecting with his wife and daughter while he saves the world?  There were, after all, lots of comic scenes in Charade and thats both a charming classic and, probably, part of the inspiration for Three Days to Kill.",1425859200,2,2999,4.648956356736243

While Ive seen some movies able to pull off an action/drama type scenario...this one falls flat, its as though they chopped up 2 different movies and put them together, one action, the other a family drama. After more thought, it was much more of a family drama than an action movie.
SPOILERS HERE:.... You could tell even Kevins hesitation to say some of the lines or when he did it wasn't convincing at all...like in the car and meets the CIA agent lady...""oh sure I just met you, go ahead and shoot me up with God knows what you have in that syringe""...who's going to let a perfect stranger do that??!! Yes he was desperate....to live....not desperate to die.
Oh and he comes back for more and still doesn't know whats in it...still hasn't verified the CIA girl....it all just a very weak plot and turns...Kevin is better than this and deserves better.
By the way, I'll never watch it again, there was no chilling action, no chilling acting..it was all blahh. The best parts were literally in the previews.",1422230400,,1392,4.756198347107438

6349891,5,B00JA3RPAG,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie enough to see it again or buy it. Although I am not a Kevin Costner fan, I watched this movie because it had the Luc Besson name attached to it. I have been disappointed with some of Mr Besson's films, but this movie hits all the right notes and never loses it's energy. This film does not take itself seriously, which is why it succeeds. The violence and bloodshed is kept artistic and stylized, the characters are broad and fantastic, the plot is over-the-top but not ridiculous, the tenderness is kept light and funny, and on and on. Somehow the movie flows flawlessly in spite of a crazy plot that meanders a bit. I suspect that somehow Mr Kostner is to credit, he uses just the correct amount of humor and detachment to make things fit; things that in other movies would have felt dirty or flat or stupid. I keep thinking of the Ocean's movies, which involve odd characters and snappy dialogue welded onto a taught heist plot. In this case we have an older James Bond-type hit man who is manipulated from one strange but classy shooting scenario to another, while juggling his reunion with his estranged daughter. Even though Kostner and his character are American, this film is very French; the slick, artsy scenes of shooting carnage, the beautiful French street scenes, the car chase, the ultra-beautiful woman/women, the odd juxtaposes of characters, etc. etc. I want to see the movie again because it is very textured; there are some scenes wherein the main character is hallucinating and the effects are disturbingly good, there are scenes involving some squatters in which the father is the most optimistic man imaginable, there is a woman CIA super operative who changes her hair and costumes fabulously, etc. etc. The Kostner character maintains his scruffy beard and scarf and beat-up leather jacket throughout almost the whole movie, unless he is physically forced to change it. Odd, odd stuff that really works. Recommended.",1422057600,,1971,4.886567164179104

Too many cliches to even begin to discuss.  Basically, the old, washed-up super-government-operative is still in the game, then quits, then gets recruited (through a horrible pretense i won't spoil) and is forced to go on several missions.

Horrible plot, stiff emotionless acting, bad stereotype characters, and heavily staged action scenes.  Ugh.

Mr. Costner sometimes appears to be an older, more infirm ""Jack Ryan"" (Harrison Ford's character) - but does not appear to understand the basics of firearms, bombs, driving, or telecommunications.  (I had to suspend waaaaay too many basic ideas to stomach the plot.)

And then there's the ""bicycle"".  Heavy-handed, metaphoric, and painful to watch...  [no spoilers]

6349933,2,B00JA3RPAG,"3 Days to Kill COULD have been a decent enough movie. There are people who are going to love it and others, such as myself who find it trite, predictable and exasperating.  It is unequal parts entertaining in a goofy dramedy sort of way combined with extreme sentimental corniness to the point of being little more than annoying much of the time. It also mixes that sappy sentimentality with usually extreme violence.  This rarely bodes well for a film.  By the end of the movie, I could only come to one conclusion:  although it contains a number of decent enough entertaining moments, this movie as a whole is really bad.  Its sole saving grace, if one can call it that, is Kevin Costner.  Costner does well as a gravel-voiced CIA agent, dying dad and badass, but the overall script is so bad that even Costners talents could not redeem it from its overall ridiculousness. By the time we reach the final exasperating Costner breakdown at the end, the annoyance level is so extreme that I had to yell in disgust at the screen.

3 Days to Kill pushes the limits of credibility to an absurd degree on virtually every level.  It tries very hard to be funny and there are indeed several moments that had me smiling. But it is so corny and sappy overall that it is just flat out annoying most of the time.  Our hero, Kevin Costner, is an international bad-ass capable of killing entire roomfuls of bad guys and yet is a complete idiot when it comes to his own daughter.  Of course, that is the supposedly entire point of this movie and, of course, we've seen this kind of device many times in other movies.

 In addition, on top of all of the goofiness, I found the beautiful Amber Heards performance as the CIA agent in charge of running Costner so poorly acted and annoying that I was really kind of hoping for her demise by the end.  Instead, her obnoxious character was turned into a kind of Santa Claus.  I suppose that was done in order to try to convey the idea that she was not such a completely self-obsessed jerk after all.  Ive seen really good actors in many bad movies who even then usually try their best to bring something real to their character, but Heard apparently lacks the kind of acting chops needed to bring her character to life beyond this phony, cartoon stereotype she portrays, so she comes across as nothing more than an all-knowing, all-seeing, self-inflated bitch from hell.  Im sure the director had something to do with this, but still, I would think a decent actor could manage to find something to rise beyond this smug, ugly character she portrays.

 And while Im at it, the need to throw a family of house squatters into an already ridiculous situation almost appears as a desperate shotgun attempt to introduce yet another element into the story which has absolutely no relevance to the main story.  It is yet one more sentimental contrivance, I suppose, to convey the essential underlying humanity and fundamental goodness of this CIA killer.

I managed to watch this turkey all the way through without turning it off.  It had at least that much going for it.  But in the end, Id wished that I hadnt bothered to stay with it.  It simply wasn't worth my time.",1419724800,,3192,4.56140350877193

Costner, who is superb in this role as an aging CIA operative with enormous fighting skills, is dying from a disease for which there is no cure. After having neglected his wife and daughter for years, he decides to quite the CIA and be with his family. However, the CIA offers him an experimental drug and other incentives on the condition that he undertakes another mission. He agrees. The drug has weird affects upon him, including when he is in gunfights, but he goes after several hired guns in an action-filled manner.
Meanwhile his daughter is totally estranged from him and has fallen into bad habits and bad friends.

Overall, this movie provided exactly what I had hoped for: an action movie from Costner.  Call me a sucker, but I do not feel he is as washed up as many seem to think.  He still is a good actor who usually takes good roles.

The movie provided just enough ups and downs, lefts and rights and one decent twist to make an action movie something more than shooting, stabbing and elevator ""accidents"".  The plot had substance.  In fact, it had enough substance that practically any military member in the past decade could relate to Costner's character when it came to his family.  Sometimes the separation are necessary even though it is hardly ""convenient"" for anybody.  Because of that edge I gave the movie a fifth star instead of four I thought it deserved.

6350084,5,B00JA3RPAG,"Mr. Costner has not really done a whole lot of memorable stuff in recent years.  He seems to have fallen out of the limelight quickly and heavily.  There are some very good reasons for that, such as movies like The New Daughter and many others that I cannot even name, they are so forgettable.

However, 3 Days to Kill is a big step up from the bevy of nameless titles. I wasn't expecting much, and I came away from it thinking, ""Wow, that was really good.""

So much goes on in this movie. There are so many side-stories going on in Kevin's character's life that all tie together, that you truly feel for the guy, and you, as a viewer, can fully empathize with his situations ... because, like I said, there are many.  However, none of them pull you away from the main idea, and that is what makes this movie work. The director, McG, short for Joseph McGinty Nichol, is extremely adept at pulling off convincing action scenes, car chases, and shoot-outs, while mixing them with subtleties, tears, and humor-relief.

Really, all of that is in this movie ... and more.  All the acting is spot-on and tight.

AQ is even better.

If you like Kevin Costner, you'll like this movie - he does a good job as usual.
Some funny lines and areas in the movie that make you chuckle.

The story is not bad - pretty good actually and the directing style is a little different at times.
Plenty of action.

I'm not sure why I did not give it 5 stars - I guess it's missing something ? In some ways you want more action I guess.

6350114,5,B00JA3RPAG,"You can't go wrong with McG and Jean Reno at the helm. You just can't. Kevin Costner is fantastic in this - wry, engaging, more human than hero, funny. His father-daughter chemistry with Hailee Seinfeld is fantastic - she is such a wonderful young actress, I loved her so much in True Grit. Amber Heard is slinky perfection - maybe not the best actress, but you can't take your eyes off of her when she's on-screen. She projects true femme fatale, classic noir icyhotness. Not much of Connie Nielsen, which was a little tiny bit disappointing, as I'm a fan of her work too. Shot in Paris with love - this is infinitely, infinitely better than the somewhat similar but totally different (I know, I know) ""Taken"" starring Liam Neeson (a movie which I thought was pretty good - but this is GREAT). Lots of scene-stealing minor roles. Highly recommend.",1412294400,,848,4.66

I didn't like any of the characters (NOT Costner, his daughter, his fellow spies/hitmen, even the Villain was boring). I thought the action was very disjointed.  The tone of the film was odd, not tongue in cheek or satire or black comedy.................. it just seemed awkward and stilted.  the cool tough women seemed superficial and irksome.

Watch as the movie veers from the genuinely involving emotional moments between the hit man's daughter, ex-wife, African squatters, Greek limo dirver and everybody else to his expert skills with a HK 9 mil, driving, knifework, (not the culinary kind) grenades, AK's bombs, karate, judo, mumbo jumbo and Qantas aviation skills. Kevin Costner, it has to be noted, is a very fine actor. I bought him in this role. Problem is, the plot wanted to be all things to all people. Only in retrospect does the ""theme"" of the move shine through, the hitman's need to keep hitting, as a way of knowing that he's alive. I think.. that's what the Heard character represents, the need for the edge.

Complete with embarrassing special effects, poorly staged action scenes and unbelievably corny dialog, 3 Days to Kill is a wasteland of missed opportunities, implausible relationships, and horrible acting.  Costner grunts his one liners and Amber Heard is flat out embarrassing as the cold, calculating femme fatale who strains credulity by offering Costner an antidote for his brain cancer (which induces some dime store special effects whenever Costner becomes excited).  Then inexplicably, Costner coerces a spaghetti recipe for his daughter at gunpoint. Yeesh.

6350206,3,B00JA3RPAG,"This film was poorly marketed in the U.S.--promising an octane thriller where instead the viewer is treated to a very Luc-Besson movie. 3 Days to Kill is an interesting look at the dynamic between a CIA killer and his family/daughter, with some (rather poorly researched/hokey) CIA/espionage elements. Costner and Steinfeld do really good jobs with their characters, but Amber Heard as Costner's handler is pretty annoying/unbelievable. Nevertheless, the various comedy and dramatic moments never seem to quite mesh into something really great, but do paint an interesting movie, if you're into Luc Besson's style of storytelling.",1410307200,,630,5.572916666666667

6350212,4,B00JA3RPAG,"I love Kevin Costner. He always delivers. I really liked the story line, and the ending, all of it. My only bone to pick is kind of a spoiler, which I don't do bit it has to do with his condition, and how they are working on it. Kinda of unrealistic. This coming from a person with a family member with a similar condition. That's my only bone to pick.

Parent guide: I would let my kids over 14 watch this as there is very little language, most of which is in subtitles as it is coming from someone speaking a different language, violence is there but not overly graphic, little to no sex scenes. There is one scene in a strip club of sorts that shows nudity through a fog, but it is brief and you can't see much. 14 and up, in my opinion would be ok. Maybe watch it before you let your children and decide for your self if you question the nudity.",1410220800,,849,4.083832335329341

After renting it I knew I had to add this to my DVD collection.  From the first second the movie starts with a shootem up action sequence I was hooked.  The thing that made me love this movie was it immediately switched to comedic problems for Costner's character and onto a charming and warm story about Costner and his daughter.  Then enters the mysterious women to add to Costner's troubles.  As the stories play out there is action, Intrigue, comedy, and a warmth to capture the audience.",1409875200,,604,4.504587155963303

Harrison Ford and Chris Pine have played this character in other movies like Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger and Shadow Recruit. Although not a bad movie, this is probably one of the least impressive Jack Ryan movies Ive seen. Kevin Costner plays Ryan and he is dying. Anther CIA agent has a drug that may help him, but she needs him to do a job for her requiring him to kill many people, which he seems to have no problem with. For an old man dying of cancer, hes pretty tough, almost too tough. Because he is dying, in the mean time he is trying to re-connect with his ex-wife and daughter. So he is having to juggle this assignment and spending time with his family without them knowing he is still working. He told them he was quitting because hes sick. As I said, it wasn't a bad movie, but there was nothing that stuck out in it. Its just kind of a throw away movie, sort of  typical for the genre. It was kind of a blah script. Its probably much more exciting in book form. You will probably enjoy it, but then forget about it within a day, or maybe three days.",1409616000,,1176,4.25

6350240,4,B00JA3RPAG,"I didn't hold out hope for this one after seeing it was helmed by McG who directed the horrible ""Charlie's Angels"" films and starred Kevin Costner who hasn't been relevant since ""Tin Cup"".  I was intrigued when I saw it was based on a story by Luc Besson, the godfather of Gaelic cinema who brought us ""Le Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon-the Professional"".  It should also be noted that he had a hand in the ""Taken"" films that resucitated Liam Neeson's career.  Costner does seem engaged here but it's beyond me why actors of a certain age suggest world weariness with five o'clock shadow and a rasp that sounds like they smoke a carton of Marlboros a day.  Regardless the film mostly works because it doesn't take itself seriously.  It's not a case of style over substance but style is the substance. With characters named Vivi, the Wolf, and the Albino and cars speeding, glass breaking, bullets flying, and things going boom this is a complete tongue-in-cheek affair.  I viewed this as a campier version of ""True Lies"" which itself was a parody of spy films and I hope Costner et al were in on the joke.  Amber Heard certainly was because she chews the scenery at every available opportunity as Costner's adrogynous handler. For nothing else the film contains probably the best prom scene since the original ""Carrie"".",1409529600,3,1312,4.728070175438597

6350248,2,B00JA3RPAG,"This movie is a mess. The tone is all over the place. I thought that it was going to be a plot-driven spy thriller. Maybe a little like ""No Way Out"", a memorable Costner vehicle from the 1980s. However, it isn't. A large part of the movie is a family drama about Costner, the CIA agent, trying to reconnect with his ex-wife (Connie Nielsen) and daughter (Haylee Steinfeld). He has terminal cancer and wants to re-establish relations before he dies. Another part of the film is the assassinations that his CIA handler (Amber Heard) wants him to complete. His incentive is a miracle cure for his cancer that Heard promises him. If this sounds ridiculous, it is because it is. By the way, that about it with respect to plot. There are some bad guys Heard wants Costner to kill-no mysterys and nothing to figure out. He just has to kill some guys. In the middle of the rather graphic mayhem, there is some weird and inappropriate humor interjected.

Heard is also given some of the worst dialog. For example:
Costner: You're not me type.
Heard: I am everyone's type.
Amber Heard is not a bad actress, but she is terrible in this. Nielsen and Stanfield fare only a little better. In fact, Costner is such a commanding screen presence he pretty much carries the film.

This movie was a flop at the box office and now I see why. It is an incoherent mix of graphic violence, goofy humor, and family tear-jerker.",1409443200,,1403,4.541501976284585
6350249,4,B00JA3RPAG,"3 Days to Kill
 I like a nice surprise now and then, and who doesnt?  This weeks movie is the nice surprise.  I expected, and told my pals, that this didn't look like much, a run of the mill shootum up with no character and no class.  At best I expected something along the lines of one of the lesser Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson films.  What I got was an emotionally satisfying film about a workaholic dad who has destroyed his home life and his attempts to make it right.  To paraphrase one of our teen reviewers of yesteryear, this isn't a good shootum up, it is a good movie with some shooting in it.  Further, it is a good movie about family.
 Kevin Costner plays Ethan Renner.  He has been absent from his family so much that it hardly matters when the actual, formal break comes.  At various junctures, at those important life markers like birth never mind the smaller ones like birthdays and soccer matches, he has been far away killing for the CIA.  Now he wants to make it up to his wife and daughter.  But he is dying so he has to hurry.
 Hailee Steinfield (True Grit as a child and last years Enders Game) is his 16 year old daughter.  Steinfield herself is only 17 and she brings as much irrational teen daughter angst as anyone could want to the role.  If she can survive being a teen in Hollywood, no small matter, we will want to watch her in future roles.  She has a certain screen presence that should serve her, and her audiences, very well. She has several projects in various stages of production through 2015.
 Amber Heard matches her in on screen charisma as the CIA handler who bribes, blackmails and cajoles Ethan Renner into doing a last series of jobs for her before he cashes in his chips for the last time.  The CIA handler is named Vivi Delay which has sort of a ring to it.  Heard gets to dress up in flamboyant outfits and make hard-as-nails tough girl comments.  She seems to have a fine time and she is fun to watch.  The beautiful 27 year old actress recently became engaged to Johnny Depp which demonstrates both her attractiveness and her courage.
 Danish born journey-woman actor Connie Nielsen plays the hurt, angry Christine Renner, Ethans estranged wife.
 I found some of the family/job interfaces to be laugh out loud funny.  In one instance Ethan has his captive, an Italian money launderer; give his daughter a spaghetti sauce recipe over the phone while sitting tied up with a gun to his head.
 I thought Costner did a bang up acting job here, one of his best.  It is a shame that Water

World and The Postman (both of which I rather enjoyed) sullied his chances for mega movies.  On the other hand, he has a collection of more modestly scaled successes to his credit. He has an ambitious assignment with 3 Days to Kill.  He must portray love, regret, longing and the fear that he will not be successful in rebuilding his family.  This is a tough go for an actor but Costner rises to the challenge.  Oh, he must do all this while killing villains and dealing with his manipulative CIA handler at the same time.
 Director McG, real name Joseph McGinty Nichol, 45, has done some fine work artistically in the past.  His We are Marshall found favor with the fickle flakes who make a buck by bashing movie makers.  The public liked his two Charlies Angels flicks and Terminator Salvation.  In 3 Days to Kill he puts in a few of the cool things that we like as movie goers.  There is a continuing gag with a bad guy, a father of twin teen daughters, who helps him sort out, or try to sort out, his problems with his daughter which is a touch not often seen in this genre of film.
 The writing is of a high level.  The most famous of the pair that penned the screenplay is Luc Besson.  His writing credits in the action realm include Taken, Columbiana and Transporter-all films that I liked.  He is also notable for directing the classic French language thriller La Femme Nikita which I re-watched on TV last week.  He also directed the nearly cultish The Professional with then child actress Natalie Portman and French actor Jean Reno.  Reno also appeared in La Femme Nikita as a Cleaner, the job assigned to Costners character in 3 Days to Kill.  He also directed the best movie ever made, The Fifth Element.  Well, a very entertaining movie at any rate.
 I may be alone in the critic community in giving 3 Days to Kill a strong three and a half saw blades.  This actioner lasts one hour and 57 minutes.  Lots of dead bad guys give it a PG-13 rating but they just die normally, not in slow motion with ghastly effects.  Writers Luc Besson and Adi Hasak also had a hand in the production.  They carefully budgeted $28 million to make the film.  It grabbed $12 million in three days of the opening weekend, and that just in the domestic market.  The two writer/producers will be able to send their kids to college on this one, unlike the producers of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.",1409356800,3,4914,4.4225195094760315

6350288,1,B00JA3RPAG,"This film has got to be one of the worst movies I have every seen - I'm mid-forty. It is one of only three films that I ever left from pure irritation. It is the kind of movie that people criticize Hollywood for perpetuating those horrible stereotypes of race and gender. Here is a flawed hero with 1 foot in the grave who goes out of his way to protect his teen-aged princess but shows no moral concern for the dignity of the squatters in his home. The female CIA agent, good enough to hunt for a kingpin, must hire the strong-armed hero to do the job while she relies on her sexual charms - in other words she is a bimbo. The person who described this as a psychological thriller must not know what the term means. It was a comedy cloaked in gratuitous and unrealistic violence and the editing sucks.

6350296,4,B00JA3RPAG,"This is another inconsequential movie Kevin Costner has made of late. It is also the most entertaining.

It offers a view at a slight angle to the universe on the trope of a master killer a-dying who longs to connect with a child too long ignored.  Being a prodigal dad is a perfect role for Costner whose gift for comedy has always been playing an off balanced and likeable every guy.

What Costner achieves is making an assassin funny when he is off the clock. 3 Days to Kill is Bourne or Taken played for laughs.

Costner makes it easy for us to put aside any sense of morality and skim over the killings as he spends much of his time fumbling at getting to know his daughter and pumping information from one or another comedic bad guy who he keeps locked in a car trunk or shackled in a bathroom.  These baddies supply details pointing Costner to his targets along with cooking tips and advice on how to relate to a teenage daughter.

Both of these bad guys are as necessary and delightful as Joe Pesci in the first Lethal Weapon.  But these guys are not Pesci's take on a Tasmanian devil but a mild, wry, and in the end not really bad guys.

There is a remarkable amount of murder and mayhem in this movie for those of a a bloodthirsty bent.

The plot requires a little too much suspension of belief, as Costner fights an opponent whose nefarious objectives are never really that clear.  Like to many of its genre, the protagonist dispatches two, three, four or more of his opponents almost without breaking a sweat -- though he is clearly disabled throughout much of the film by a life-threatening malady.  All-in-all, still worth the time and ""the price of admission.""",1408406400,,518,4.8522727272727275

6350325,4,B00JA3RPAG,This was an especially good movie because Kevin Costner portrays to his daughter that he is a salesman that travels a lot on the road but he is a spy. He neglects his daughter and can't be there for her birthdays or special occasions but he tries. The action comes from the spy games with plenty of action and shooting. I think it was especially good because there was a good story with a family that he wants a part of and his wife is always trying to get him to quit. But he can't seem to get away from it all. Touching things that enlighten the heart but still an action movie. I think anyone would like this movie.

another plus for amazon. it is not. the selections are the grungiest possible grouping I have ever encountered and I am an
inveterate movie observer going back over 80 years. of the  approximate 15 movies I have chosen over the past two months,
(after purchasing the service), 12 of them were not of any saving grace relative to content or professional presentation.

6350400,4,B00JA3RPAG,"I love Kevin Costner's work to begin with, so ""3 Days to Kill"" for me was well worth the rental.  The plot: he is a highly skilled and sought after CIA operative who has basically lost his relationship with his wife and daughter in pursuit of his demanding career.  But something changes in his life that draws him back to the daughter who is now 15yrs old and the wife he still loves.  This action filled romp involving job, family, death, life and renewal is sometimes laugh out loud funny, sometimes poignant and at all times violent as he continues to be pursued by those who would much prefer his unnatural demise.  There's enough twists and turns and flash backs, ranging from endearing moments between a Dad and a daughter he barely knows, between a man and the wife that still loves him too, not to mention moments of heartbreaking truth, that sets ""3 Days to Kill"" off as a bit different from the cookie cutter expectation of such a screenplay.  Kevin Costner is just right for the part, being a Dad to a 15yr old, scared but successfully navigating those waters by hiding it all with a steely nerve, but with a gentler side that comes from his eyes and smile; he's quite charming in this film.  The family unit is just as endearing as it begins to heal along with him and find new hope.  I'll buy this and add it to my library.",1406851200,,1337,4.4105691056910565
6350401,1,B00JA3RPAG,"Yet another of Costner's dark murderous characters and an absolute failure. The flick is clearly derogatory of human dignity and so cynical that it is hard to watch. The main murder-assassin employer for the Costner character appears as some form of feminist goddess at every wet job she assigns to the poor dying bastard. The question is if she's so ubiquitous why she needs to hire him? Plot: Mushy family melodrama alongside the murderous spree, appearing to offer some perceived, but absent, philosophical depth to the flick. Waste of time. Good things it is just a few hours, not three days. But it surely feels like days of your life have been taken away after you watch it.",1406851200,,680,4.771186440677966

6350442,3,B00JA3RPAG,"The play on words in the title misdirects the audience: the title is part of what Costner says to his on-screen daughter, that they have 'three days to kill' while the estranged mother is out of town.

The acting was good, the effects were good, the tradecraft and depiction of the CIA as essentially an international kill squad was poor (simple fix would have been to explicitly state that Costner's character as well as the other 'hit squad' characters were expats hired 'for this mission,' or to simply call the agency something else.)

The problem here is that it was marketed as a trill-a-minute action movie about a terminally ill Costner who MUST take out a nest of terrorists in order to get a life saving experimental treatment.  It should have been marketed as a comedy about a hardened, bitter man at the end of his career trying to reconnect with a daughter and wife that he has been estranged from for years, who also happens to have to kill to get his treatment.  It would have worked much better if the front of the film had been lopped off, and it started with some monologue about 'returning to Paris after five years away from my wife and daughter,' and then have the 'oh, there's [insert character name,] he's on the list...' moment when the audience realizes that 'Holy CRAP, he's a hit man!'

As it is, we watched it expecting an action movie with some humorous 'you don't understand Teenager' moments, when it was a lot of mournful moments with some action here and there.

And yes, Vivi was so far over the top (the outfits and come hither-ness) that it detracted from the feel of the rest of the film.",1406246400,,1625,4.5479452054794525

6350529,2,B00JA3RPAG,"Kevin Costner is Ethan Renner, a veteran CIA agent, who has just been diagnosed as terminally ill. To spend his last three months with his estranged teenage daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld, True Grit), Ethan travels to Paris, where he is given another and possibly final assignment by mysterious Vivi (Amber Heard).

Directed by McG and written by Adi Hasak and Luc Besson, Three Days to Kill sets out to be both a thrilling James Bond-like action and a sweet, character-driven drama, but fails to be either, because of the slack pace and underwritten characters. Kevin Costner does his best, with his occasional attempts at comedy, but the film slowly loses momentum, not knowing what it really wants to be.

Of course, this is a film we should not take too seriously, I know (and I liked McGs Charlie's Angels back in 2000), but with a weak storyline and poorly-edited action sequences, plus forgettable villains (called The Albino and The Wolf), Three Days to Kill is a disappointment.",1405382400,2,989,4.916167664670659

6350556,3,B00JA3RPAG,"I came away from this movie thinking, not bad!  And Costner still has it!

It moved pretty fast, there was action, there was wry humor, there was Costner's character's personal emotional conflict & desire to make up for past misgivings( he knows he was a crummy hubby, as well as a crummy Dad. The regret is very strong and many years have passed since he left the two of them).

Then you learn of the little problem, where Costner is told he has a terminal illness and  maybe, with luck, he has a  handful of months at best to do the things he wants.

You know, like reconnecting with loved ones.

 So that news throws a wrench into his plans of having a different future- a possibly new future.

Stoically, he decides he will make the best of what time he has left, anyway.

The problem is, no sooner does he make this decision, when he finds himself being sucked back into the kind of work he just wants to give up.

 But the lure used to get him back in, proves too irresistible and for good reason.

( But I won't give anything away.)

It isn't long before you learn how his illness, his work and his personal life are all interconnected in a complex triangle.

He wants to live- he doesn't want to work- he wants to  focus on reuniting with his wife and child, but to do any of this, he is put in a catch  22 position.

And so, that catch 22 provides the impetus for why he goes back into his line of work.

All the while, you know as the movie unfolds, that he is racing against time- his time line to do his job, his time line on how long he may have to live.

And then, there is his own personal time line to try to recapture what he once had with his family- if they will let him back in their lives.

 Like I said above-he is given an irresistible reason to NOT say No to the job .

The story then unfolds quickly, once it is made clear to the audience why Costner is out there hunting bad guys( sick as he is), while trying to juggle in some quality time with the wife and daughter.

I found this movie showed Costner still has talent, though I am not used to see him in Macho Kick Butt roles.

While he is now older than his FIELD OF DREAMS days- he is ruggedly handsome, as opposed to the good looking boyishness he used to possess years back.

So yes, he can still be a charming leading man- like Liam Neeson- who I believe is older than Costner by a few years.

While he played this role believably- I don't really feel it suits him to be an actor in the* shoot em up /beat em up* category.

  This is more Jason Stratham's type of  movie genre.( And I do like Stratham )

That being said, I look forward to seeing other  future movies Costner may be in.

As for Amber Heard- her acting is not that great, but  as we know, she makes for excellent eye candy.

For being an integral character in the movie, it seemed surprising she did not have a lot of dialog or more scenes.

If you are a Costner fan, you won't be disappointed, but you may feel he is out of his element in this kind of movie genre.",1405209600,,3015,4.101027397260274
6350557,5,B00JA3RPAG,"Kevin Costner doesn't mass produce movies, but when he does, it is usually pretty well done.

6350560,5,B00JA3RPAG,"A CIA agent (Kevin Costner) is forced to retire after acquiring an exotic illness. Now with the short time left on this mortal coil he turns to the family that he neglected. But wait there's an experimental drug that may change the situation. The cost to him is to get back into the game. Oh did I mention they're hallucinatory side effects which may gum up the works.

There is a wide range of opinion from people viewing this movie. Yes it is formula; some people like the formula and some people don't. It's predictable; some people like predictability and some people don't.

The fun in the movie is not the story but the interaction between the characters in the story. Instead of the simple shoot-em-up, we learned a little about parenting skills. Both shoot them up and parenting skills can be fun. This film is well worth the watching. Do not let naysayers sway you from what might be an entertaining presentation.

6350650,1,B00JA3RPAG,"I'm not a big Kevin Costner fan but decided I'd give this a chance.  I should have gone with my instinct and left it alone.  Luc Besson is primarily responsible for the script which, not surprisingly, is therefore shot mostly in Paris. That location is the movie's plus. Otherwise, not so good.

Costner, an aging, always disheveled CIA  ""agent on the ground,"" is assigned to capture a dirty bomb being sold from the ""Albino"" to the ""Wolf,"" two international bad guys who need to be taken out as well. After his first encounter with the Albino, a doctor tells him his cold symptoms are actually those of cancer and gives him 3 months to live.  Amber Heard, an unflappable super CIA agent invariably dressed in garb that better suits a dominatrix, is sent to assist Costner. She offers him an experimental drug that will potentially extend his life - but only if he agrees to finish the job. What follows is a procession of action scenes set against farce, some with Heard, in which our star is either rousting or shooting down a long line of inept thugs.

Yet, what takes center stage is another theme entirely.  Amidst the violence, the film becomes a comedic chick flick as Costner stumblingly attempts to become Father Knows Best to his 17-year- old daughter whom he's neglected for the last five years and is living in Paris with her mother. Added to this syrupy base, inexplicably, is a completely out-of-context African immigrant family who have squatted in Costner's Paris apartment during his lengthy absence.  Their simple manner supposedly prompts the jaded super agent to realize what is really important in life (??).

McG (give me a break!) directed this disaster, and Besson's lines are more embarrassing than funny. Oh well, I give you 3 minutes to turn it off. If you get as far as, ""it's a mustache, it's a goatee,"" - it's too late!",1404518400,17,1849,4.717391304347826
6350651,5,B00JA3RPAG,This is a very entertaining movie that has some beautiful shots of Paris.  Costner comes across as a dangerous CIA operative with a surprising sense of humor.

6350670,3,B00JA3RPAG,"There may be spoilers.

I think that those trying to compare this spy thriller with the ""Taken"" movies and Liam Neeson suddenly becoming a premier action star are missing the boat.  There are some similarities to be sure.  Ethan Renner, a CIA operator is played by Kevin Costner.  Like Neeson, Costner may be past his prime hunk status of a decade or more ago, but also like Neeson, he still has a certain presence that commands your attention.  This film also features a teenage daughter, here played by rising star Hailee Steinfeld.  She's not kidnapped or in immediate danger.  But she is taught how to ride a bicycle - a purple one at that - by absentee father Ethan.  Unlike the Neeson vehicles, this one is played for laughs, quiet though they may be.

Ethan is forced to retire when he learns he has a lethal cancer that gives him just a few months to live.  Now living in Paris (much shot in Serbia), he's asked to perform one last assignment by his new handler, Vivi Delay (really) played by Amber Heard in mostly dominatrix designs.  The two strike a bargain.  Ethan gets cash, a large life insurance policy and most importantly, a magical drug that has the potential to stave off his illness.  In return he has to kill a couple bad guys known as The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) who have plans to set off a suitcase nuke.  One other problem.  The drug has some hallucinogenic side effects, which are amplified when the heart rate increases.

So Ethan struggles with his multi-layered assassin assignment along with trying to put his family back together with Zooey (Steinfeld) and his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen).  I almost forgot.  When Ethan tries to move back into his apartment, he finds an extended family of immigrants from an African country (Mali?) have moved in.  See, none of this is terribly serious.  Consider this.  In order to get the location of the primary bad guys, Ethan grabs the evil-doer's chauffer.  With some mild on-an-off torture, he solicits advice from the guy about how to deal with Zooey.  After all, the accountant has twin daughters Zooey's age.  And in another case, the torturee is an Italian accountant who is asked to provide the recipe for spaghetti sauce for Zooey.  Most of this is ridiculous of course but that's the fun of it all.  And Costner is a pretty good straight man.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of action sequences that are formidable if nothing new.  This isn't a great movie or even a very good movie.  But I had a good time.

I watched this film on an excellent Blu ray transfer.  It comes in a 1080p resolution and a 2.37:1 aspect ratio.  Beautifully detailed - check out the gracefully aging Costner face - and provides some terrific panoramic shots of Paris.  Colors are excellent.  Great picture.  The audio is excellent as well.  The primary track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It works great, especially in the numerous action sequences including the requisite car chase, several gun battles and some close up fighting.  Dialog is clear and well positioned.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, English and English SDH.  Extras include a making-of short, a profile on director McG, a piece featuring a real CIA operative and a trailer.  There are 2 options as well as to which feature to watch.  The theatrical version and an extended version (5 minutes longer).",1404345600,,3379,4.7353951890034365

And you might think that that's a giveaway but it really isn't. Just like any assassin, he also has his ""Non-Assassin"" life which can sometimes get in the way, and vice versa. Which one does he choose? Can he have them both or non at all? You'll have to hit ""Watch"" to find out!",1404172800,4,1051,4.536842105263158

6350706,2,B00JA3RPAG,"3 Days To Kill was promoted in a very misleading way. The previews, the description, even the cover of the DVD make it sound like an exciting thriller. They even manipulated the name of the film, to make it seem like one thing, when it really meant another. The story centers around Ethan Renner, (Kevin Costner) a man who has spent his entire life killing people for the CIA. Renner has found that he only has a short time to live and wants to spend his remaining time with the family he's largely abandoned. His retirement is short lived however, as his old bosses at the CIA promise to help with his medical care if he'll do one last job, a job he doesn't want his family to know about. 3 Days To Kill was made to look like the dying agent had 3 Days To Kill his target, but that's not true at all. The title refers to him spending 3 days with the daughter he hasn't seen in 10 years. Like everyone else, I was fooled by the films promotion and decided to see it, even though Kevin Costner stars. I forgot the fact that Costner hasn't made a decent film in about fifteen years, and assumed that 3 Days To Kill would lead him away from romantic films and be a return to what made him a star, but it wasn't. The action and intensity of a CIA thriller is a back story, to a film about a dying man reconnecting with his family. It wasn't as boring or depressing as a full on drama, following a similar storyline, but it wasn't far off. Much of the hunt for his target was used as comedy to break up the monotony of watching Renner teaching his daughter to dance and ride a bicycle. To be honest, the film really is just a whole mix of things, none of which work. The cast is dreadful, the story is all over the place, and the film is just ridiculous. 3 Days To Kill was a horrible experience, and not only did I hate this film, I feel like I was tricked into watching it, by some clever marketing people, who knew the film was garbage. You can decide for yourself, but if you could use an extra two hours to do something you've been putting off, I'd skip this movie and get it done.",1404000000,,2081,4.153465346534653
6350707,3,B00JA3RPAG,"We rented this movie because we're Kevin Costner fans, and we'll pretty much watch anything he's in.  This movie had some entertaining moments, and if you approach it as kind of a silly version of those super-spy in mission-impossible situations, it has some merit.  I think Haley Steinfeld as Costner's daughter was terrific.  The movie was just so implausible in so many ways that really it should have just gone all the way and been a total send-up of the genre.  That would be a good film - hope someone is making it - a kind of ""Airplane"" version of James Bond - without Mike Myers (Goldmember).  But I digress.

Kevin Coster pretty much sleepwalks through this movie.  His best moments are when he's with Steinfeld.  Silliest moments are when he's doing his spy work - some of the silliness is refreshing, as when he asks for parenting advice from the guy he's slowly torturing for information on the bad guys.  The movie is slow at times.  Costner was much better in his recent release Draft Day.  Looking forward to seeing that one again.",1404000000,,1046,4.630434782608695

6350754,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I'm a father of 3 children with basically no time to go to the movie theater (unless of course is a kids movie). Recently I watched on my video streaming service JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT, NON STOP and 3 DAYS TO KILL, with the highest expectations for the first one and the lowest for the last one.

So first, JACK RYAN was just ok, but ultimately a let down since I really like the Harrison Ford movies and I also like Chris Pine a lot (I think he did a great captain Kirk), I guess somethings just don't mix well.

Then there was NON STOP, which I wouldn't doubt that has taken the title from SNAKES ON A PLANE as the worst airplane thriller...seriously, I think SNAKES made more sense and had a more believable story, or at least a wasn't as boring.

After a so/so and a bore, I finally got to 3 DAYS, and I had so little faith in it that I even put it as background while I was doing something else,  Boy, was I gladly surprised when the movie begins and I see that the story is by LUC BESSON !!

Let me tell you, nobody mixes a warm story and edge of your seat action like LUC BESSON! Yes, sure, the plot can be a little bit silly at times but that is part of his charm, and to be honest, I don't think that there are to many action movies with a solid ground on reality.
If anything, If you are a fan of action and want to share a nice movie night with your wife, without worrying of excessive violence and gore, this is the movie for you! And by the way, I'm going to have see it again with my wife because I know she will love it, (one of her favorite movies is THE PROFESSIONAL) and you know what? I'm sure I'm gonna enjoy it a second time around!

Thanks and I hope that this was useful...",1403568000,,1699,4.026706231454006
6350755,3,B00JA3RPAG,"Well, this movie does not know what it wants to be.  Is it a spy thriller?  Is it a dramatic comedy about a father getting know his daughter?  Does it succeed as either?  No.

Let me state right from the start that the 3 stars in this review are for the action scenes that are realistic, exciting, and different.  And for the performances Costner and Amber Heard give.

This movie starts as if it is going to be an interesting spy movie.  Costner and his young (and stunningly beautiful) handler are riveting.  He is practical, no nonsense, violent, and smart.  She is crazy, heartless, unpredictable, and highly motivated.  If the movie had proceeded with these two characters and built itself into a serious plot, this might easily have become a novel film that rivals the Bond movies with its realism.

******BEWARE SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW:

It fails us as a spy thriller because of all the interruptions, which amount to slow and boring scenes with family.  A teen whining and complaining and lying to her father who was never there for her.

Then it turns interrogations into funny scenes.  When the hell has interrogation with a car battery ever been funny?

Then, to top it all off, this highly competent operative does stupid things.  He allows strangers to live in his home--yeah, the home where he keeps all of his equipment.  He takes hostages into his home filled with strangers.  Then he tortures them in the bathroom there while little kids are running around just outside in the hall.  While he interrogates, he gets fatherly advice from one criminal and a delicious Italian tomato sauce recipe from another guy.  He puts the first guy in a car trunk multiple times and parks in crowded areas--here is where the ""comedy"" of it all is supposed to distract us.  No one notices the banging in the trunk.  No.  Not at a school teeming with teens.

******SPOILERS OVER.

When ""Ethan"" is called to action by his new handler, things get really good.  When the film tries to portray him as a depressed dad or a funny torturer--I kid you not--it fails miserably.  And it leaves US miserable.  And bored.  Rolling our eyes, always on the verge of stopping the movie.

To understand 3 Days to Kill, imagine the best spy thriller you've seen--maybe a Bourne movie, a Bond movie?--and try to mix the scenes of Fried Green Tomatoes and Get Smart into it.

6350772,2,B00JA3RPAG,I generally like Kevin Costner but not in this movie.  Oh he was okay but the whole premise of the thing was beyond absurd.  It was stupid.  The woman who played the CIA control was a cartoon character.  I know it's just a movie but the CIA is supposed to be covert not running around in Paris shooting up the place.  Costner must have had 3 days to kill & agreed to be in this MST3K reviewable movie.,1403481600,,401,4.089743589743589

6350778,3,B00JA3RPAG,"Given how the critics raked this film over the coals I was expecting it to be awful. Maybe I went in with low expectations (not always a bad thing) but this was entertaining enough. Costner plays the gruff badass with something to prove and if you excuse the time-running-out-because-he-has-only-3-months-to-live construct, which seems like a pelt point they constructed to give the story tension, it's a pretty enjoyable flick.",1403308800,,428,5.3088235294117645
6350779,3,B00JA3RPAG,"In 3 days to Kill, a dying CIA agent (Costner) is  trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter and wife while being offered an experimental drug that could save his life in exchange for one last assignment.

This movie offers and tried to be different things at different times.  It is a bit action, a bit comedy, a bit family drama and a bit suspense all in one.  Although it doesn't reach greatness in any of those it does have its moments that make it just enough to make it watchable.  It is almost as though the writers were not sure what exactly type of movie that they wanted it to be.  The action and CIA part of the story is a decent one but always gets distracted by all the other pieces that make up this movie.

Costner is good in the role though as this is one of the strengths of the movies weaknesses.

Overall a decent watch although fails to be as good as it could of been with all the mix of elements making it a weaker movie than what it could have been if they had just concentrated on the best elements.",1403308800,,1028,4.182741116751269

6350781,2,B00JA3RPAG,"Good action sequences, and Costner was great with the one-liners. Amber Heard was TRASHY - every scene with her in it made me cringe. She was like a bad-dream right out of an R rated movie. The girl may be sexy, but she can't act. Some strong language, and the whole movie felt choppy. Wanted to like it but just couldn't get there.",1403308800,,332,4.285714285714286

Paris, however, was just as lovely as ever.

This is a Friday night movie.  Find something else to do.",1403308800,,345,4.7

6350790,4,B00JA3RPAG,"This movie was a combination of private life and the job he did all mixed in. Actually, kind of funny throughout, yet with a serious tone. The action was pretty good and it was different enough to actually hold your interest. Think it's worth the watch at least once.",1403222400,,267,4.469387755102041

6350792,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I was pleasantly surprised from this film. I actually enjoyed the film the whole way through from beginning to end.  There's no lack of action, drama, suspense, plot, and of course good ole pg-13 family fun and cia adventure. It's a solid 4 star movie at the very least and I gave it 5 stars because I enjoyed it and found nothing wrong with it. Many films are terrific but are brought down by little things that may annoy general audiences and I feel this film was very smooth from start to finish. I loved the characters, plot and clever writing. It had some wonderful twists, amusing and comical scenes that give you an uplifting feeling leaving you smiling.
  I also will not give a film 4-5 stars if most of the film is good but the ending is a letdown. This film doesn't let me down at all. Kevin Costner gives a solid performance in this action packed cia film. *spoilers* Killing is 2nd nature to him but wants to retire and focus on family after receiving some bad news. I was not only thoroughly entertained but I love films where you feel like you are actually there and can throw yourself into it like a great book. This film is recommended and also definitely worth it if you pay for it to rent or buy. I'd actually watch it again! Ha ha ""vodka and his gun."" Not sure if anyone else picked up on it but if he just would have carried around a flask with some vodka and maybe a gun he would have had no problems at all. Just take a drink when he has dizziness. And also wouldn't have to reach for his ankle gun if he was packing some hardware or 2. I just thought it was funny everytime he went to kill someone important he had dizziness lol. I was yelling buy a flask and put some liquor in it the whole time lol. Anyway in conclusion totally satisfied and pleasantly surprised! A must see for 4 star movies and up. Thanks for reading!

I finally got time to do so and I was upset with how misleading the commercials and previews were.

6350822,4,B00JA3RPAG,"If you want a typical action - adventure movie, this isn't it.  This is about a CIA agent who has learned and continues to learn during the movie that life can be about more.  He evolves emotionally in his relationship with his daughter and ex-wife while dealing with a terminal prognosis.  He does another job for the agency in order to obtain an experimental medicine to treat the cancer (in a huge scary syringe) while working with an odd and improbable partner.  If you're a Kevin Costner fan, this is a good movie to watch.  Don't miss the dance scene with his daughter - emotionally, it's a great scene.

 My main complaint about the movie is that one of the scary villains is ""The Albino"".  What is the deal with that?  We have to be so careful in using politically correct terms for everyone else but not people with albinism?  And why are we so quick to make our villain a person with albinism?",1402963200,,903,4.451219512195122

I liked it. I especially liked the mix of the spy/action plot juxtaposed with the family drama...a mixture that was often hilarious and sometimes poignant. I've heard films described as ""popcorn movies..."" I'd say this is a solid entry in that category.",1402704000,,500,5.024096385542169

6350853,5,B00JA3RPAG,"WRITER LUC BESSON brings his magic touch to 3 Days to Kill about a CIA terrorist specialist whos suddenly retired when he develops terminal cancer.

We know Besson from the Transporter series that made Jason Statham a household name  No.s 4, 5, and 6 announced  Taken, with Liam Neeson, and La Femme Nikita, the original movie and both TV series. This time, he shares script credit with Adi Hasak  but make no mistake. This story is Bessons.

He likes his men macho and his women ultra-strong. His stories are always over the top and carry a smart, tongue-in-cheek humor. 3 Days to Kill has all these qualities  so I wonder why it wasn't the hit it should have been. (Critics hated it, too  but what do they know? Is there some weird anti-Costner thing going on?)

Gonna tell you now, I love it. Kevin Costner is perfect as American cowboy assassin Ethan Renner. Hes on the trail of a dirty-bomb selling terrorist known as The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and his henchman, The Albino (Tmas Lemarquis). Ethan finds himself back on the case via his dominatrix-type handler, Vivi (Amber Heard), who tempts him with an experimental drug that could cure  at least delay  his pending demise. This is important because our hero hopes to re-bond with his ex-wife and daughter.

What makes this work is the chemistry between Costner and the ladies who make up his family played by Connie Nielsen (Gladiator) and Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar-nominated for True Grit. Strong women, see? Theres also great chemistry between Costner and those who become his unwilling informants, bringing in some unexpected humor  more like the kind we found in RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous. Not Besson, still great).

Visuals and sound are Blu-ray terrific. A busload of extras provides interviews with the cast, Besson and director McG, known for his TV prowess with Nikita, Chuck and Supernatural. We learn about the stunts and action sequences  all on a par with Taken. But the winner is the feature with ex-CIA agent, Bob Baer, who tells us about the problems of keeping a family together and working in the agency. He also hits on improbable cover stories, how not-to-make friends while on assignment, and the drive to pursue the bad guy. Life in the CIA  Its like out of the movies, he says, laughing.

He also says agents learn not to trust anyone  even their own people. But you can trust me. This is an excellent action flick with memorable characters and great stunts. It belongs in the Besson archive.   Kay Reynolds",1402704000,2,2492,4.807511737089202

This movie really had a fun vibe to it and I really enjoyed it a lot! Kevin is still smokin' hot (I fell in love with him as Robin Hood). His character goes through a lot of great growth and I really enjoyed his off-beat relationships with random characters throughout the movie! :)",1402617600,,429,4.375

6350867,4,B00JA3RPAG,"This spy dramedy was probably the best movie that I have watched in a long time by the veteran movie actor Kevin Costner.  Let me first say that I am a fan of Kevin's work in Waterworld and the Postman.  Two cult movies that got a lot of crap from people but were great escapist movies.

This movie is a bit more grounded, not syfi at all.  Well, except for the ""experimental"" drug that he is offered.

However, I felt the movie could be compared to Taken or Taken 2 for some of the themes around the ""missed opportunity"" angst that the main character feels at being a ""lifer"" CIA agent.  But, it had a grounded, comedic side that only Kevin Costner can pull off.  I liked it.",1402531200,2,676,4.234375

When he returns to his apartment he finds a large african family squatting there and the police unwilling to evict them in the summer months.  A CIA control agent, Amber Heard, forces him back into action with the temptation of a untested drug
that may be the answer to his health problem, a large check and a million dollar life insurance policy.  Some good dialogue and humor makes the movie fun.",1402531200,,685,4.362204724409449

She's a very good actress. Costner did pretty well also. Although there were times when he really didn't seem to have his heart into it.

Movie did just seemed to drag.  It had some fun moments but overall weak.  I think I prefer the ""Transporter"" series of films over this one for entertainment and action, even with the bad acting thrown in seemed to have more to root for in those films.  Kevin Costner is a nice guy but doesn't have the intensity like Liam Neeson or Jason Statham would have given, although I suppose they had to cast an American to play a CIA agent.  Mark Harmon (NCIS) might have been an alternative ""nice"" guy casting choice.  It may not have mattered who they cast - the script probably didn't help; script just seemed overall weak.  Daughter was annoying, ex-wife might as well have been a cardboard cut out - didn't contribute anything to the movie at all, even his CIA counterpart didn't make much sense.

His movies typically contain his dry sense of humor combined with a dull sense of emotion, so I thought this one wouldn't be any different - and he didn't disappoint.  However, considering his roll in the film - a close-to-retirement CIA agent with a terminal illness trying to reconnect with his teenage daughter while also pulling off a job - the lack of emotion and dryness of humor actually fit well in my opinion.

This film had a more developed, (but still shaky plot) with some mild action thrown in to keep you from getting up and leaving.  The movie focuses on the relationship between he and his wife, his daughter and humanity.as he deals with his mortality.  There are some support ""action"" characters that are thrown in clumsily and add more confusion than excitement.  This movie might better suit those looking for a movie that helps you believe in tomorrow, but the storyline is predictable and I think the few actions scenes there are would damage the flow.

6350923,3,B00JA3RPAG,"I was left with the impression that the producer targeted the 20 - 30's age group with this film. Kostner was used as a draw for an otherwise okay movie. The story line had humorous parts that detracted from the dramatic content. It has some good action, and characters. The boss was a female 20 something that kept popping in and out to direct the old guy (Kostner). No problem there, but the story seemed unreal when Kostner beat up a guy, put him in the trunk of a car, then treated him and his family like friends. Even asking for help with his teen daughter behavioral issues. Almost comedic the way the story went in and out of drama taking a few distracting comedic turns.
Put it on the movie to watch when you stay home ill list. The 20 to 30 something set would probably get it better than their parents.",1402272000,,813,4.3202614379084965

6350925,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I gave this film 5 stars because the film was cheeky and off-beat and fun entertainment. And so much better than many of the other movies in its sub-genre. There were moments when transitions from scene to scene were too fast, and the aggressive female character controlling Costner's character was a wee bit over the top, but if you like Kevin Costner, and you enjoy Bond-esq type films this one is fun.",1402272000,,404,4.625

6350932,5,B00JA3RPAG,"First of all I am a Kevin Costner fan so I wanted to see this film.  I do think that his acting and roles have evolved and he seems more comfortable and relaxed on the screen now than when he was younger.  The character he plays in this film is different than most action/adventure films. Picture a, shall we say, ""hit man"" for the Agency.  He has found out he is dying of cancer and quits his job to spend his last moments getting to know his estranged daughter and patch things up with her and his ex-wife.  Nothing is quite that easy and he is forced back into duty for one last mission-at the same time that his wife leaves him in charge of his teenage daughter so she can go on a business trip. So here is the problem. How does he perform his job AND spend time with his daughter?  What results is a series of often humorous events where he tries to balance these two things. He even gets advice from others on how to handle his daughter at the most odd moments. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of action to go with it.  This movie was a good mix of danger, action/adventure, family drama and humor and even sentimentality.  Costner handles all of these transitions with ease.",1402185600,,1184,4.258928571428571
6350933,4,B00JA3RPAG,"This is one of Kevin Costner's best films.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.  To start
with, the story was strong with just the right amount of difficulty for Kevin's character
to deal with.  I enjoyed watching him overcome each problem as it arose.  If you like
your action with a good story and the right amount of believable action, then this
movie is for you.",1402185600,,365,4.402985074626866
6350934,3,B00JA3RPAG,"Costner gives a nuanced performance combining his standard inscrutable demeanor with whimsical dry humor which plays nicely  within the overall dark comedy narrative.

Plenty of enjoyable action and the roles of Costner's wife and daughter in the movie are well done -somewhat hokey but it all works as a lightweight enjoyable ride overall!

NOT a great action adventure BUT it is Costner spreading his wings! -He's terrific! And i am not a big fan of him.",1402185600,,456,4.973684210526316

6350939,1,B00JA3RPAG,"I enjoyed seeing Costner again on film, but that's about it. The script was stupid and somehow the whole thing was heavier than it seemed intended. It fell flat.

6350940,5,B00JA3RPAG,"This plot has been implemented in more than a few novels and movies, but is well executed in this example.  Costner is excellent as the gruff aging good guy wondering how his job got in the way of his family, His pending mortality brings things into another focus as he tries to include his family into his final months, but his past deeds keep getting in the way of the calm family life he seeks.  The interplay with his ""new boss"" is perfect, the villains are dastardly enough, and the action along the way will keep you watching.  Highly Recommended.",1402185600,,553,4.51

6350944,4,B00JA3RPAG,"I like a lot of his movies, but I really think this one is his best.
The whole CIA absent daddy thing is an excuse that translates to real life so easily. Divorced dads don't need to be CIA agents to identify with how it feels to be separated from your kid or kids. It's so hard and so easy to distance yourself from your kid and ex-wife. You want to see your kid(s), but it can hurt so much to see your ex having all the time with them that you don't, especially when they're seeing some other man. The longer you're away, the harder it is to get back. Most dads don't even try after a few years. They just feel left out of it altogether. I know this all too well from the kids point of view and the dads as well. Divorce or separation for whatever reason can be a real bitch.

6350947,4,B00JA3RPAG,Surprisingly good Kostner was great and the plot twisting and thick. Lots of left hand turns unexpectedly. Watch it for the thrill of it.,1402099200,,137,4.75
6350948,3,B00JA3RPAG,"This is an example of a Hollywood genre I find extremely puzzling: the violent thriller with laughs. The only thing missing in this artificial exercise in crowd pleasing is the laugh track. Why did I watch it? Because the trailer looked promising. And I really like Kevin Costner. He is a real team player and always acts the script to a T. He can be effectively serious and dramatic, or equally effective in comedy and romance. Although in terms of acting I am more drawn to Ralph Fiennes, or Anthony Sher, or Derek Jacobi, or John Gielgud (Oh, the ones trained by and for Shakespeare - how quaint!), Kevin Costner strikes me as an indigenously American actor,
like Jack Nicholson and Bruce Dern, and that is a sincere compliment to all three actors! Well, the script of this film is a hodge-podge. We get the sentimentality of a father-adolescent daughter relationship; the artificiality of the estranged wife who still swoons for her absentee husband; the deadly, invincible
special agent, who doesn't look at all physically fit. But whoever this film asks him to - father, husband, killer - Costner pulls it off with both drama and humor (sometimes simultaneously!). I think part of his success as an actor is his fleetness and mercurial charm. He moves so swiftly in terms of characterization you just are convinced. I'm not saying his body moves fast. Actually the script makes him quite clumsy. I mean his expressions and gestures, the way he listens when someone else is talking, or the way he speaks suddenly from the heart - he can be an amazingly subtle actor and he is always completely persuasive. This film may have a poor script but it has Kevin Costner's charisma on display, and that is surprisingly is enough for me to say I enjoyed it.",1402099200,11,1754,4.735294117647059
6350949,4,B00JA3RPAG,I am a Costner fan and when I saw he was working in a Besson project I was more than a little excited. They really tried to do much in this film. Left me wondering about all the loose threads in the story that were all just subsumed in the final resolution.

We gets the bad guys, he gets his drugs, he gets to spend Christmas with his family. Awh shucks. It's very formulatic and sappy but the action scenes are great against the backdrop of Paris.

Reason being, I love action, spy-thrilling and most of all a plot.  If the story has a strong plot--a well=made Hollywood film that will capture my attention.  The only part of the film that was a bit disconcerted - was the part about him dying.  I have a weak heart for the terminally-ill, but that doesn't consume the whole film.  I am not a Costner groupie.  Just a ordinary movie buff with an obsession with gun-fights, spys and  taking down the bad guys.  Great special effects and cinematography will blow your mind.  After all, it was film in Paris!  I whole-hearted give it four stars.  If they edited out the terminally ill part, I would've have give it five stars.",1402012800,,788,4.5177304964539005

6350989,2,B00JA3RPAG,"Worst movie ever, the terrible dialogue makes it excruciating to even watch for sake of passing time. If you are bored and want to watch a movie, watch something else",1401840000,,166,4.566666666666666
6350990,2,B00JA3RPAG,Too many cliches and cheesy lines.  Amber Heard is annoying to watch. Though many movies are predictable these days this one also fails to build Amy tension.,1401840000,,157,4.814814814814815
6350991,4,B00JA3RPAG,"This movie was better than expected.  It had some unusual turns and twists,
Would recommend it as a keeper movie.",1401753600,,113,4.65
6350992,1,B00JA3RPAG,this is like a movie that was putt together by a committee who wanted 6 different movies and ended up with one horrible mess.,1401753600,,125,4.25
6350993,3,B00JA3RPAG,A lot of action but the story line was a little weak. Did I mention there was a lot of action. It was worth what I paid to watch it but not much more than that. Glad I didn't go to the theater to watch it.,1401753600,,205,3.4782608695652173
6350994,4,B00JA3RPAG,"If you look at the trailer, you know there is action. But, I know I like Kevin Costner, and this one was just the right mix. I don't know if I was just in the right mood, or happy, or just willing to let the movie unfold--I laughed, I enjoyed it, and I had fun watching. Luc Besson  (the writer of the story and co-writer of the screenplay) can be hit or miss. I loved ""The 5th Element"" but meh, on many of the movies he wrote and/or directed.  It was fun, funny, and I cared about the characters (it does help to have good actors). My favorite line? ""..because you're Father knows best!""",1401753600,,588,4.149122807017544
6350995,4,B00JA3RPAG,Quite an interesting storyline.  Good humour.  Kevin Costner is  hard not to like in any movie as his character of person always shines through; even when he plays a douchebag.,1401753600,,176,4.8
6350996,1,B00JA3RPAG,"So disappointed. Come on Kevin Costner, what have you lowered yourself to? Extremely cheesy one-liners all throughout. It was a very terribly done low-budget. Too bad.",1401753600,,167,5.461538461538462

6350999,2,B00JA3RPAG,"For a moment it looked as though the implausible story line might shape up to be of interest, but the lame ending clinched it. If I say more, it would be a ""spoiler"", but I think someone tagged on the ending to appeal to a focus group?",1401667200,2,235,4.0212765957446805
6351000,2,B00JA3RPAG,"I hated this movie.  Th only reason I gave it two stars is because Kevin Costner is so amazingly attractive.  The story line was all over the place. Way to many cliches about a kid not having a father figure growing up.  I mean come on this girl is like 15 or 16 years old why didn't her mom teach her to ride a bike and he was only gone 5 years so that would make her 10 or 11 so that makes both her parents slackers.  My dad and mom taught me to ride a bike when I was like 6.  I totally did not like this movie it was weird and  poorly written. What's with the African  tribe ""squatting"" in his apartment???  I'm so dizzy after watching this wish I could get my money back.  But Kevin Costner makes me look like Homer when someone has donuts  :-)",1401667200,,749,3.933333333333333

6351002,3,B00JA3RPAG,I don't really know if it was good or not because I had computer issues and never actually got to watch it. I figured a 3 would be a safe bet.,1401667200,,142,3.6129032258064515
6351003,1,B00JA3RPAG,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. To be fair, we turned it off halfway through so we didn't see the whole thing. The story made no sense, the characters were unlikeable and the script was ridiculous! I think the actors wanted to make a movie in France and didn't care what the result was.
It was absolutely awful! I'm only giving one star because Amazon is making me- it's a zero star movie.",1401667200,,408,4.311688311688312

6351006,1,B00JA3RPAG,"This movie was poorly scripted, poorly acted, and tremendously implausible.  Kevein Costner at various points in the movie is a ruthless assassin and a lame sit-com dad.  This movie can't decide whether it is an action film or a comedy and fails at both.  Don't waste your money.  I know I wish I had my $4.99 back.",1401667200,,315,4.473684210526316
6351007,5,B00JA3RPAG,Cute movie to waste some time with. Kevin Costner is a babe for his age. this movie is similar to the one with Bruce Willis. Where he has to keep his daughter trust.,1401667200,,165,4.03030303030303
6351008,2,B00JA3RPAG,"I love Kevin Costner & he was very good in this movie.  However, the plot line was extremely weak and seemed to pull several plot lines from other movies into this one...way too much!  Some were just plain silly...drinking vodka to make the vertigo symptoms dissapate?!?  Really?!?

Overall, just a  really silly movie.  Sorry we paid the $5.99 to watch it.",1401667200,,357,4.770491803278689
6351009,1,B00JA3RPAG,"Really wanted to like this, love the genre. But here's the bad. Costner's raspy voice throughout just got under my skin. Very silly to have him perform for so long with an accent that wasn't believable to begin with. Reviewers who mention the relationship with his daughter are spot on, there were too many scenes of them strolling around, we got it, he loves her, get on with the plot. At one point I forgot I was watching a so-called action movie. McG should learn filmmaking or go back to music videos.",1401667200,,505,4.5
6351010,4,B00JA3RPAG,"The only reason why I wanted to watch this movie was because Kevin Costner was in it and there were good one-liners in the trailer. Turns out, they didn't save the best for the trailer. There are a couple Steelers and Pittsburgh references that 'Burgh fans will love. Otherwise, this movie was fun with lots of action and, of course, Kevin, who is one of those ruggedly handsome guys who looks just as good at 59, as he did 25 years ago. The straight guys can slobber over Amber Heard, who wears some amazing outfits in this movie.",1401667200,,531,4.428571428571429
6351011,4,B00JA3RPAG,Good movie with lots of action.  Like the length.  Not too long and not too short.  Worth renting at home.,1401667200,,106,4.2
6351012,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I love action pack movies . This didn't disappointed me. Along with a good story line it had a few good laughs added in. This is the second movie in the past few months that I have watch that when making it they didn't think the F word had to be use to keep us interested. I was surprised to see some low star ratings, give it a go you'll enjoy it too.",1401667200,3,352,3.835616438356164

6351014,5,B00JA3RPAG,"Loved this movie. I was not expecting the amount of humor that was in this movie. Its nice to see Kevin Costner acting again. If you are worried about a tired old actor beating people with his walker, don't be. The movie does a great job using the actors/characters age to forward the story and add the aforementioned humor.",1401667200,,324,4.508474576271187
6351015,3,B00JA3RPAG,Probably worth watching.  Probably a lot of people who died in the movie didn't have to to carry the plot,1401667200,,105,4.25
6351016,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Closer to 3 1/2 stars. Decent movie, not bad. It starts to get lost towards the end. Almost like they hadn't quite finished the script before they started shooting...",1401667200,,166,4.758620689655173
6351017,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I really enjoyed this movie. There is a bit of violence, as is typical in a spy action thriller, but there was also a good amount of comedy. When this movie was over, I was glad that I rented it. Definitely worth the price of admission for an evenings entertainment.",1401667200,,266,4.34

6351020,3,B00JA3RPAG,"I have seen better movies, but this was entertaining and sure beat the TV programs on Saturday night.  The acting was good and I like Kevin Costner and would probably see most any movie with him in it.",1401667200,,201,4.2894736842105265
6351021,3,B00JA3RPAG,"We took a chance hoping that we would at least be mildly entertained.

The story line is very very very typical....the plot twists were predictable. Action was decent and fun. The surprise was that there were more humorous moments than expected....

So ""3"" rating is about right for us.",1401667200,,286,4.816326530612245
6351022,2,B00JA3RPAG,"Started off with a good premise, but then the story became too convoluted.  Found myself waiting for it to end.",1401667200,,111,4.55
6351023,5,B00JA3RPAG,Loved this movie! It was unexpectedly funny and it had the right amount of action!  Kevin did a great job!,1401667200,,106,4.3
6351024,2,B00JA3RPAG,Funny but not as suspenseful as I would have liked.  I generally don't enjoy Kevin Costner films but this one was ok,1401667200,,116,4.2727272727272725

6351027,4,B00JA3RPAG,Pretty good movie. Costner is really good in this movie. Action was good. Good story as well. It is worth watching.,1401667200,,115,4.523809523809524

6351029,3,B00JA3RPAG,Good movie but a little far fetched.  It kept me interested enough but turned to more of a comedy than a thriller.,1401667200,,114,4.181818181818182
6351030,4,B00JA3RPAG,Good plot and action Costner did a great job as a CIA agent torn between job and his estranged family,1401667200,,101,4.1
6351031,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I really enjoyed this movie. This storyline captured my interest early and held it. Costner was in character from the start and achieved all the desired emotional levels of bad a$$, loving parent and husband, with plenty of comedic influence. Wonderful movie but not for children.",1401667200,,280,5.108695652173913

6351035,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Good movie, lots of action. Kevin has a believable role., and it ended on a good note. Not like some movies where your wanting to know what happened after all that the character went threw.  He should make more action movies.",1401580800,,225,4.487804878048781
6351036,5,B00JA3RPAG,I loved this movie. Kevin Costner was so funny. It is certainly is not a guy guy's movie but it entertained me and made me forget my worries for a while.,1401580800,,153,3.967741935483871
6351037,5,B00JA3RPAG,A change from the typical action flick - if you like your action/adventure movies laced with a healthy dose of humor and sentimentality then this movie if for you.,1401580800,,163,4.655172413793103
6351038,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Sort of an American James Bond but more light-hearted, more humorous scenes.  Interactions w/people he's interrogating are pretty funny.  Also has a ""Jack Reacher"" feel to it.  There is violence but it's not graphic rather more implied.  Plot is pretty straight forward & simple.  However, it is entertaining & fast moving.  I would certainly recommend it for rental, not so sure about purchase.",1401580800,,395,5.190476190476191

6351042,5,B00JA3RPAG,Not sure why everyone is giving this movie such hard ratings but I really liked it. It was funny where it needed to be and serious in the important times. If your looking for just a good action packed film with some thought then watch it. It's entertainment if your looking to fill your brain with science find a documentary.

6351044,3,B00JA3RPAG,Sometimes I wonder why I watch Kevin Costner movies. I have come to the conclusion that he really isn't a very good actor. So i keep watching hoping this is the one. And it isn't. It was just okay.,1401580800,,197,4.076923076923077
6351045,4,B00JA3RPAG,I heard this movie didn't do so well at the box office so was a bit hesitant. I was surprised to say the least when it actually had a pretty good story line. Costner did a very good job in this one. He pulls off a believable Jason Bourne type considering he is dying of cancer. Sorry about the spoiler. It is definitely worth the $5.00 for HD download.,1401580800,,352,4.115942028985507

There was too much drama in this and too much storyline revolving around the daughter.  Kevin's acting and action were top-notch.  He just gets better with age.  But the movie dragged for me.

If you are thinking about buying this movie thinking you are getting an iTunes Digital Copy and DigitalHD UltraViolet copy, you will be seriously disappointed. I just looked at the back of the slipcover and this movies DOES NOT contain an iTunes Digital Copy. It is DigitalHD UltraViolet only!!!!! Buyer beware!!!!!

It is time that 20th Century Fox stops forcing DigitalHD UltraViolet down our throats and offer us the choice of BOTH iTunes Digital Copy and DigitalHD UltraViolet like they did with The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty and Walking With Dinosaurs The Movie 3D.

6351070,1,B00JA3RPAG,"This film was stereotype and formulaic to the extreme as per the following, seen many times before in film:
1. Our lead character is an enforcement agent (what type? Doesn't matter.) and is having a hard time adjusting to life; i.e. can't quite get his life together.
2. He's a divorcee (or about to be) with the now boringly over-used added character of a rebellious teen daughter (some films add a younger sibling, and some films alternate gender for either role).
3. As an ""agent dad"" he tries to juggle re-connecting to family and newly added enforcement duties.
4. There's the usual black market selling of something (this case the usual atomic whatever) to/by the usual Eastern European types (of course an appropriate city needs to be named - none better than Belgrade) with the added bonus of a Middle Eastern destination (guess what country, this year it's got to be Syria - duh!).
5. There's the usual gunfights that can only be real in some one's imagination.

Dumb dialogue e.g. two CIA agents at CIA headquarters introduce themselves to another agent as, ""We work for the Central Intelligence Agency"". Well, duh! Maybe they should have also spelled the words out since obviously this other agent must be really dumb. Then they proceed to plop two manila folder files of bad people onto a desk. If the CIA is still using manila folders to transfer information then the US of A is in for a ""world-of-hurt"".",1401408000,15,1417,4.760162601626016
6351071,3,B00JA3RPAG,Thought it had a lot of humor I wasn't expecting Thought Costner did a good job playing someone his real age,1401408000,,108,4.190476190476191
6351072,5,B00JA3RPAG,"I have enjoyed Costner's work for decades and have even supported his quirky pieces such as ""Message In A Bottle"", ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"" each of which drew a lot of ""fire"" from critics and larger film audiences.

In my opinion, in ""3 Days to Kill"" his acting maturity and emotive excellence have exceeded his past works by far.

By my criteria for enjoying films; the value of the writing, acting, directing and production, this movie hits high on all fronts, but especially for the writing of Costner's role and his acting. Even though he is portraying the central character he manages to carry the subdued gravitas of his character's situation through all of his scenes while raising the stakes with a measured, hard edged, side that he surfaces when called upon that plays as a counterpoint for the major theme of his character having a short time to live. Costner is to be congratulated for his bringing a better portrayal to that multi-faceted role than I believe the writer provided or that the director was attempting to evince from his actors. It is a gem of a picture for the depth of the main character alone.

The rest of the cast does well but they are much more ""surface"" than the story allowed. I was especially pleased by the portrayal of the teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld of ""True Grit"" fame). She did not get the chance to provide the depth that she did in ""True Grit"" but her abilities are evident and, if you measure capability by her production resume (she has five films in ""completed"", ""post-production"" and ""filming"" categories at the time of this writing), then she will have a long and great career in movies.

I did find the antagonist roles to be too surface for my liking and the actors in those roles did not have much to work with but this movie is all about Costner's abilities and I totally agree with that choice.

Definitely worth the viewing whether you are a Costner Fan such as myself or you just want to see a well produced thriller/drama or drama/thriller (you choose).

Enjoy!",1401408000,,2030,4.6722689075630255

Or was it the movie overall, which has Costner barging back into his estranged family's life, wanting to be a dad and husband for real during his remaining time, all the while killing a variety of ""bad guys"" and passing out in the middle of a couple of chases/gun battles?

Whereas the latter film was well paced and populated by believable characters in an interesting and well written script, 3 Days to Kill has none of the above.  The writing is cliche and laughably predictable, the characters are likewise cliche and one-dimensional (plus Costner's attempt to sound weathered and tough comes off more like Costner with the beginning stages of throat cancer).  McG's tries too hard to make the film come off as ""cool"" (which is probably another way to try to show Costner as relevant to a younger generation) but executes the attempt with utterly unbelievable characters, dialogue (e.g. key emotional conversations over schizophrenic and drug addled edits), and scene transitions (most obviously in the character Vivi's high speed driving through the streets of Paris while nonchalantly forecasting the next major plot point dressed as something between a super model and a dominatrix).",1401235200,2,1028,5.339506172839506

The primary and secondary reasons for me not giving this movie the 5-star treatment are:  The character playing Costner's handler could have used more development to make her role more believable (Costner is the worldly and experienced agent but being handled by one about 1/2 his age), and; leaving the success/failure of the experimental drug treatment to the audience is a bit cruel when he is pursuing a real relationship with his daughter.

It starts off reasonably despite the absence of any sort of logic and by about the 30 minute mark descends into embarrassment and frankly bizarre cinematic territory, borrowing ideas from Besson's other flicks and blending them all together.

Amber Heard is the unconvincing femme fatale who functions mainly to drive at break-neck speed through Paris and Connie Nielsen is really wasted in providing the ""Are you still working for them?""/""You said you'd quit!"" routine every 20 minutes. Costner phones-in the performance and struggles to make much of the risible script other than to have his health condition kick in every time he sees the bad guys who, by the way, are inept and unthreatening.

It's hard to believe this is from the same writer that brought us La Femme Nikita and Leon/The Professional, and though the film has his trademark pretty-but-deadly girl, it's really a neutered ""funny"" version of Taken. Director McG proves that screwing up Terminator 3 was no mistake and he's truly committed in his attempt to win a Razzie Award at some point soon. There might a drinking game that makes this marginally more enjoyable but unless it's free to watch on a plane or some other place where you literally have nothing to do, I would avoid this train wreck.",1401148800,,1536,4.99609375

Kind of the same hard-to-believe special effects as a Danny Trejo movie, but the same don't want to look away result.

6351181,5,B00JA3RPAG,"There are so many reasons to watch this movie, and not one I can think of not to. It has so many serious, funny, sentimental, and intense themes running through it, that so many who watch this will identify with this movie. I won't give away anything really important but I will share some of the things I loved about it. Costner is a CIA agent, and decides for a few reasons he wants to retire and reconnect with his estranged wife and daughter. Now, he has three days to do this one last job, and promised his wife that he would be out of the CIA life for good. I will say there is something really serious that makes him really reflect on his life.

Now, while trying to complete this last job, he has a boss who is a really beautiful, strong, tough young lady who promises him something that will benefit him and his family if he finishes this last job. Now as he is in the middle of this job, his wife goes away on business, and Costner's character says ""no sitter, I will take care of her."" He was confident he could handle a teenage girl because he had one good moment with his daughter and helped her feel good about her hair. This is where the real humor comes in. I have a teenage daughter and she has a mood for every moment of the day. And what she loves today, she will hate tomorrow, and it's my fault I did not know this ahead of time. Hailee Steinfeld who plays his daughter was priceless in this role and plays the teenager role perfectly. I won't give anything away But there is a scene where he buys her a bike. In fact when he shows up to say hi after several years away, he brings this bike with him for his daughter. Remember I said you need to remember this bike and that I am telling you it is key for some of the funniest moments in this movie. Now, this is not a comedy. It is a very serious movie with good solid humor, a father ending his career in the CIA and while doing this last job, he has to watch over his daughter. I related to this movie because of the intense action, fight scenes, shoot outs, the mysterious beautiful woman who gives him this last job, and how Costner wants more then anything to reconnect with his daughter and his wife. The writing I think is amazing, the acting even better, and the balance of so many themes going on was brilliant. This is one of Costner's best work in years and I am telling you, this is a movie for almost everyone. It will make you smile, make you cry, make you think, and all the while you have this intense action / drama film going on. I really think the dynamic between Costner and his daughter really makes this movie along with so many other things you will love. It will be different for everyone, but one thing is for sure, if you want to see a great film, and to be entertained for over 90 minutes, then it is a must see for you. You just cant go wrong with this film. It just hits all the right marks, humor but maintains the serious nature of what he does for a living. Now remember, I left a lot out. I did not want to give away anything like a commercial would. It is an action film, a drama, humor in all the right places, a father reconnecting with his family, especially his daughter, and that is the part that actually made me laugh out loud. Picture a tough guy Killer CIA agent trying to think like a teenage girl and think it will be easy!!!! If you are parents, you will get this, if you are not, there is a ton of other scenes, plot, and theme that will make you love this film. I hope you give it a try.

But the whole thing is mixed with this super-confident beautiful CIA agent who requires Costner's character to kill six or so people for her.  If he does these deeds, she gives him an experimental drug that will cure his terminal illness.

Why, by the way, does this CIA beauty, ask him to kill people right in front of her and when he refuses, she shoots them dead without compunction?  Why not just shoot them herself and get it done and over with.  I mean if you want something done right, do it yourself.

The editing is as strange as the way the director put the whole movie together.  Costner's character tries to teach his high school-age daughter how to ride a bike and while you see this interaction, there is a back conversation that doesn't match up with what is happening...weird...

6351227,4,B00JA3RPAG,"Writer Luc Besson has given us such films as The Transporter series, the Taken series, La Femme Nikita, The Family and other impressive films. He is joined by Adi Hasak in transforming his story 3 DAYS TO KILL in to a film. It is a mixed bag - not bad, not particularly good, but watchable because of the actors involved. The director is television director McG. The problem seems to be an attempt to be a father daughter mother reconciliation, dealing with metastasized brain cancer in a hired killer dependent on periodic injections of a experimental chemotherapeutic drug given at the hands of a super spy woman, and the taking down of the world's meanest criminals - supposedly the last job before our hired killer reconciles with his family to die of his cancer. Sound fun? Leave it to Kevin Costner to make it work.

Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), a dangerous international spy, is determined to give up his high stakes life to finally build a closer relationship with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), whom he's previously kept at arm's length to keep out of danger. But first, he must complete one last mission - even if it means juggling the two toughest assignments yet: hunting down the world's most ruthless terrorists - The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and The Albino (T&oacute;mas Lemarquis) and looking after his teenage daughter for the first time in ten years, while his wife is out of town. The instigator of the action is the strange head of ideas Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) who elects to run Ethan's life as he tries to survive cancer and the flighty response of his daughter with whom he eventually forms a solid relationship through cutesy father/daughter means.

Not a bad movie, a bit too long, a bit to sappy at times, but entertaining nevertheless. Grady Harp, May 14",1400889600,6,1834,4.819047619047619

6351263,2,B00JA3RPAG,"I love Kevin Costner films for the most part and he always seems to deliver - but even he fails to carry the day in this uneven and confusing movie.  Is it an action film, a comedy, a father-daughter-wife reunion flick?  The number three seems to be a recurring theme: three times Costner's character (Ethan) suffers a physical breakdown just as he's about to kill the bad guy; three times his wife gives him another chance; he has ""3 days to kill"" while his wife is away on business and he has to be responsible for his daughter, and at least  three times during the movie I think I was supposed to laugh and didn't.  (If only Director McG, whose experience is mainly in television, could have put a ""laugh track"" into the movie to ""prompt"" me.)  The story line and plot are as ludicrous and pretentious as the director's stage name: McG,  whose tempo, plot, and character twists seem more appropriate for television, and come, perhaps coincidentally, about every six to eight minutes; in one scene our hero is coldly and efficiently dispatching bad guys, in the next, (after a future commercial break?), he's interrupting or postponing a kill or interrogation so that he can talk to his daughter on the phone, (once to give her a recipe for spaghetti sauce), in the next he's witnessing the birth of a baby while lamenting his own absence from his daughter's birth, and so on, ad nauseam.  This movie is so uneven it should be a ride at Magic Mountain or Disneyland.  The insertion of Amber Heard as Ethan's ""boss"" is apparently a pretext for the romance-challenged director (read his bio - didn't do too well with the girls in high school) to get a good looking woman strutting around in seamed stockings, spike heels, and tight leather outfits.  Her character drives around Paris at breakneck speeds for no apparent reason, works really hard to maintain a dominatrix pose at all times, twice improbably appears at the scene of a crime and rescues Ethan after one of his ""episodes,"" and generally plays a character so far-fetched it leaves one, like Ethan at times, feeling as though one is waking from a hallucinatory dream (perhaps starring Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"" - for you old-timers who may have watched Diana Rigg in full leathers).  The final scene, when Ethan opens a ""present"" from her that is actually more of the serum that keeps him alive, suggests some chemistry or feeling between them (also lacking with father and daughter) that never existed in the previous two hours of the film, and is wholly inexplicable, as is Ethan's decision to twice bring bad guys to his squatter-infested Paris apartment for interrogations, or taking a check (instead of cash) as payment for his services!  Like they say on the NFL network when someone does, or says, something so absurd, stupid, or bad it's beyond belief, ""Come on, man!""  Based upon my movie experience with this director, and the way he wasted a game Costner, I say to McG, ""3 days' and you're out!""

6351264,3,B00JA3RPAG,"My husband and I sat down to watch this movie tonight.  We wanted the theatrical pg-13 version.  When we pushed play, a box came up that said Theatrical or Extended.  Theatrical was gray and Extended was white.  We chose the theatrical version by moving the selection of brighter white lettering to the theatrical version.  Unfortunately, at about Chapter 18 there was a really un-necessary nude scene.  We went back to make sure we had selected the theatrical version and found out the selection should have been the lighter gray writing, not the white.  I am not sure if this makes sense, but make sure when choosing which version of the movie you wish to see, the selection should be the gray color, not the brighter white color.....

The movie was a pretty good action film.  The growing relationship between the father and daughter was pretty funny and at times sweet.  Kevin Costner's character is to the point and does things his way. Period!  Plus, he looks pretty good scruffy!  I have seen better movies, but I have also seen much worse.

The director of Charleys Angels..with a script from Luc Besson...Kevin Costner at his best.  and the young girl from True Grit and Enders Game as his daughter. ..as soon as it ended, i wanted to watch it again.",1400198400,85,550,4.840425531914893
6351279,3,B00JA3RPAG,"Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) darts through the city wearing various large expensive scarves, attending to his roommates' grandchild's birth, teaching his daughter how to ride a bike, fighting (occasionally), and wooing his ex-wife. And also having hallucinations due to an experimental cancer drug. There is probably more romance and family drama (childbirth, dancing with daughter, ""I'm sorry"" conversations with ex, ""I'm sorry"" conversations with daughter) than fighting action in this movie.

The comedy elements are much more emphasized than in, say, Taken, which was all ""serious"" action. This is much less serious action - he tortures people but only gently (yanking off duct tape from skin), and even takes advice on Italian cooking from one captive bad guy. In some ways it's odd that the romance is treated as gravely serious, while the action is treated as droll comedy.

 I was a bit annoyed at the number of critical action scenes that were suddenly averted by Ethan ""getting sick"": Literally seconds from shooting a bad guy, he will constantly collapse, then roll on the ground with blurred vision. Come on! You were about to have a great fight, now it's become a strange version of ""I've fallen and I can't get up""! Still, it's entertaining enough that you won't feel your money is entirely wasted.

Overall, it's something you can watch with one eye while playing a board game or making dinner, without worrying if you miss a line of dialogue here and there.",1400112000,14,1473,5.024590163934426
6351280,2,B00JA3RPAG,"I've been a monstrous fan of Kevin Costner since his star year in 1987 where he had the one-two punch of THE UNTOUCHABLES and NO WAY OUT, which were two fantastically entertaining films and he became a bonafide movie star. As time went on, his star seemed to rise to meteoric heights with the mega-punches of BULL DURHAM, FIELD OF DREAMS, DANCES WITH WOLVES, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, A PERFECT WORLD and JFK... until the high-concept ""flop"" of WATERWORLD. Suddenly, he seemed to be box-office poison. With every new role, I kept hoping that he would reclaim his status, but it just kept fading because the roles he took just weren't enough to sustain any kind of momentum. Sure there's a TIN CUP here and an OPEN RANGE there, but for every one of those, there was a FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND. But after his earnest and scene-stealing performance as Pa Kent in MAN OF STEEL, it seemed like the time was right to get Costner back in the game. This leads us, sadly, to the tremendously banal action/family drama 3 DAYS TO KILL.

We begin with Ethan Renner (Costner, whose character name literally reads like someone looking at IMDB at the cast/characters of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL and decided to combine names), a CIA wetworker whose assignment is to stop the exchange of a dirty bomb and eliminate the couriers. However, everything goes wrong, and combining that with a rare brain cancer that has metastasized in his lungs, he doesn't have long to live. He decides to reconnect with his estranged wife (Connie Nielsen) and rebellious teen daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld) both now living in Paris in the time he has left. But the mysterious Vivi (Amber Heard) offers Ethan a potential cure for his cancer in exchange for him eliminating the threat of The Wolf (Richard Sammel), because... that's apparently important. So he has his daughter with him for three days while his wife is out of town, and in the interim, he has to do his job and humor and action and reconciliation ensues before the climax.

This film was directed by McG, the filmmaker behind the CHARLIE'S ANGELS films, as well as TERMINATOR: SALVATION and THIS MEANS WAR, and co-written by Luc Besson, who turned in all of the currency he got from creating great, genre-defining action thrillers like LA FEMME NIKITA and THE PROFESSIONAL to co-write a series of goofy-cool star vehicles for actors like Jet Li (KISS OF THE DRAGON, UNLEASHED), Jason Statham (the TRANSPORTER series) and Liam Neeson (the TAKEN series). He wants to give the same gift of middle-aged badassery he gave to Neeson to Costner, but the problem is that this film is so cliched, it literally feels like McG and Besson had a checklist of tropes that they felt they could click off in the film's 117-minute runtime. Blowing stuff up? Check. Cool kills? Check. Oddly cool fashion choices for the hero? Check. Father and daughter not being able to relate, but bonding over visiting childhood locales? Check. Father confessing he doesn't know how to be a father? Check. An exceedingly fast reconciliation between husband and wife? Check. Totally convoluted climax with lots of shooting? Check. A drug and/or a condition that will always handicap the hero at the worst possible time? Check, check, and CHECK.

At least when McG started out, he seemed to show a sense of flair behind the camera, but that time is long past. He's little more than a hack now. He shows no flair or style or immediacy. The pursuit of The Wolf is perfunctory at best, ultimately feeling like this was a film that was too busy trying to be a semi-serious action film as well as a semi-serious family drama and fails at both. Both Costner and Steinfeld are fine, but there's nothing original about them. They're walking cliches. The only character I thought was at all interesting in this film was Heard's character, walking a fine line between sexy, dangerous, intelligent and morally ambiguous, and she does it quite well, but the film can't seem to find time for her because it needs to spend more time with the father-daughter story.

There's nothing offensive about 3 DAYS TO KILL, which is probably the most offensive thing about it. It's totally safe, totally unchallenging, totally rote and totally skippable.",1400025600,2,4266,4.807901907356948
6351281,3,B00JA3RPAG,"This movie isd a good one, but it would have been a better one if it was 30 minutes
shorter. I mean i like 2 hours movies, but when you have an ex CIA killer trying to
assassinate some folks in the middle of Paris, you can make it a little faster by leaving out
the whole I-want-to-fix-my-relationship-with-my-daughter-and-wife thinigs.

The fight scenes are really good, and the violence is brutal yet not splatter. More
gunfight that martial arts, with some car scenes in the middle.
There is great humor in the movie in scenes that you do not expect.
Costner can be really funny
Of course, older viewers will recognize a huge bodyguard scene in there, and there are
some elements of Liam Neeson's CIA character in there from Taken.

Still, it is a good enough movie to watch and I recommend it, but not before you had a coffee",1399939200,2,829,4.52
