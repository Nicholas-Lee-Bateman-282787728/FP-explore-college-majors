8155930,5,B000KEVR2Q,"This documentary happens to be the best concise information you could ask for in learning or remembering NASA's Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo moon programs from concept to splashdown.  The story is told from the Mission Control (Ground Operations) viewpoint with the primary spokesman none other than the legendary Flight Director, Eugene Kranz.  Other Mission Control luminaries have absolutely fascinating input to this story as well.  You will be shocked at how much planning and preparation went into the concepts, the designs, the mathematics,  the perfection of orbital mechanics, the simulations, etc using 1960's technology.  Even after the endless preparation and redundant safety systems almost every mission was fraught with hair raising emergencies that required quick thinking from Mission Control staff in order to avoid aborting the mission and endangering the lives of the crew.

This film should be in every US school library and required student viewing not only for the awesome achievement it is but because of the pride for our country that it instils in you.  I don't think there is a single positive human trait that is not on display at some point in this documentary.  You will watch it over and over in constant amazement.

If you can't find it in the original History Channel purple DVD case it is included in the two disc History Channel set ""The Race to the Moon"".",1326672000,,1390,5.0881057268722465
8155931,5,B000KEVR2Q,"Failure Is Not An Option (2003) is a History Channel documentary about NASA's manned space program, beginning with the Mercury program through Apollo 17 in 1972.  President Kennedy said that the U.S. would have a goal of putting a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth by the end of the decade of the 1960s.  In this documentary, many of the key players in the U.S. space program that helped make this possible give their comments, stories, and insight about each of the space missions, risks, triumphs, and near disasters.  You'll hear from astronauts, flight engineers, flight controllers, and others at Mission Control.  Excellent historic footage is presented along with some computer generated simulations.

This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen on the History Channel.  I highly recommend it.

And no - the moon landings were not done on a sound stage.  Don't listen to any moron who says they were.",1296691200,3,936,4.879746835443038
8155932,5,B000KEVR2Q,"This, along with the second part, are the best shows i have ever seen on TV in years. The show is basically Gene Crantz telling the story how NASA began and taking you through the missions to the moon. The second show is from the end of the moon missions through the second shuttle disaster.

The worst part about this and i faught with myself over the number of stars to give this product, is that i have gone through many copies of this DVD and have yet to find a working copy that will play on any of my DVD/blu ray players. I faught hard with the History Channel and i bought one through Amazon and none of them work and nobody can tell me why. I will keep looking and spending money to find one that works.

If you can catch this show on History or History International (usually around the time of the aniversary of the moon landing) watch it. you won't be disapointed",1267833600,3,874,4.227544910179641
