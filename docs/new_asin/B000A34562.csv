Science only deals with empirical evidence that represents our current best understanding of whatever is being observed. It is meant to change as our understanding changes.

So when somebody opens a 3+ hour long scientific lecture with ""slam dunk proof"" it's already over and you can move right along and not miss anything. I'm glad this  came free with Prime or I would be very unhappy.",1522886400,,529,5.211764705882353

Just kidding. Definitely NOT a presentation for those who embrace the status quo (e.g.- brainwashed, incapable of thinking outside the box, possibly due to fear and clinging tightly to what they were taught). Dr. Leonard Horowitz presents some deeply interesting information as he usually does. I've listened to him speak in a couple of other documentaries (excellent speaker). In this DVD set, on the first disc he seems to be a bit distracted, but by the second disc he is more in command of his thoughts and his audience. The information revealed makes it worth the purchase, but one can also gain the same insight (in more detail) from buying his book. The DVDs are a good fast fix and a more personable experience, as they include a couple of Horowitz tangents.  ;-)",1456012800,2,864,4.76
8181494,1,B000A34562,"Flawed science, flawed logic, with the goal of steering you to a full line of Horowitz products to ""fix"" all of you NWO created problems. Horowitz is a gifted speaker, obviously quite intelligent, but there are significantly large scientific errors that I cannot imagine are just simple mistakes.

He says over and over sound is an electromagnetic frequency.

Electromagnetic frequencies can travel through space and require no atmosphere to travel. Reflect back on your middle school education that informed you that sound requires an atmosphere to travel. He's a skillful deceiver convincing the public of scientific deceptions that contradict what they have all already been taught as children.

There are other problems with his works, but this should be a clear enough example of the audacity of some of this guys claims. Remember disinformation typically consist of 95% fact with 5% deception, so don't get lost in the mix!",1288310400,12,929,5.221476510067114
