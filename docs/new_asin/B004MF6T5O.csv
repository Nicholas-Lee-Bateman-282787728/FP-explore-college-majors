8435977,3,B004MF6T5O,"I bought this UK version since the US version ( kino Video) was a piece of crap.  You think they charge $29.98 for this great movie and may be remastered??????

It was worse than those dvd for $9.99 you can find at check out counter at Target or any other discount stores. I  had  to crank up the volume up to 60 or over on my HDTV..( my TV 20 is too loud) and the picture was so bad...But this UK version my TV volume stayed on 20..I only wished they remaster the picture quality  but it was worth it since I understand the dialogues.",1321056000,,535,4.057142857142857
