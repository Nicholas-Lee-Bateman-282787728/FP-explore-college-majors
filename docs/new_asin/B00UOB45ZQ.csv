The packaging is not ideal, as the discs tend to escape from the folds in which they are stored, but the packaging itself shouldn't cause any damage to the discs.",1434326400,19,254,4.425531914893617
7066219,4,B00UOB45ZQ,"A reviewer on here stated that this show was constant laughs. It may appear that way, because the laugh track is going practically non-stop, and to hear the same track over and over really detracts from it, so you have to put your mind on something else.

I just watched the first episode and there are definitely some laughs to be had, and if you can ignore the laugh track there can be a number of laughs in a row, such was the style of A&C. This is a dream come true to me, and wouldn't had known of this show had it not started running on a retro station here recently. The dream of what I saw of A&C, was based on their movies. Their movie comedy was very good in many places, but detracting from it was all the lame singing often by people I never heard of. Nonetheless, when I watch a comedy movie I don't want it turning into a variety show, which is precisely what A&C movies pretty much were. This tv show, to all appearances, was that dream to me, to get A&C comedy without the distractions of baloney singing. Unfortunately the laugh track is almost as bad as the singing was, but at least it supports the material, rather than an abrupt aside.

The video on the first episode is very good, if not excellent, considering the age of the show. If all old shows were re-mastered this well, you would be one happy camper. Right now, just based on one episode mind you, the comedy is pretty much your usual A&C. The video is as good as you could expect from old SD. The only drawback is the gross over use of the laugh track and it varies very little. I guess I would give this 4.50 stars if I could, as it's a little better than an 80% satisfaction. I really don't expect it will change much from the first episode, so that it has a big letdown later.

Yes, the discs are held on placard holders, which as I predicted, do NOT scratch when being taken out, even if continually used that way, they inevitably will.

Edited to reflect new data: I'm into the 4th episode now and am amazed that the pathetic repetitive laugh track on episode one has completely vanished. True, there is more laughter than the material often justifies, but it really isn't any more annoying than any sitcom you know of.

I am quite smitten by this comedy. From what I know of future episodes through IMDB, Hillary Brooke is in about half of them. But what is a bit fascinating about this show, is you might call it what it would be like living in the neighborhood of these two comics, as they refer to each other by their actor names, in this case Lou, Abbott, and Hillary. I have seen the same neighborhood cop, along with a few other characters, especially their landlord more than once. I'm not sure I've ever seen a sitcom done like that before.

Here is a not-so small excerpt from the show (as I heard it).
Lou merrily skips down the street a small bit, and a lady approaches which is dressed similarly to a night dress. Lou says hello, tips his hat, and is fixing to continue on his way when she turns him aside and starts talking to him in an angry manner.

Lady: Were you addressing me?
Lou: I wasn't addressi....
Lady: Why I don't even know you. You have some nerve. How dare you speak to a single girl you don't even know? A nineteen year old who lives all by herself, at 106 Maple Street, on the second floor, apartment 23, and doesn't even have a steady boyfriend, and loves to go dancing, and is almost every evening all by herself, and whose phone number is Cresent 6 4805. (gives Lou her card) My card! Fresh! (she storms away).

edited - Just a little followup comment. A&C get pretty old in the second season, and Hillary Brooke has all but vanished. The only thing I found of much good in the second season was an episode called Amnesia, which may be the best episode overall.",1458086400,,3780,4.306610407876231
