545586,5,6303060218,"Hi, I saw this movie many yrs ago, & I love helicopters,& always liked David Jannsen as an actor, ( the fugitive) when I saw it had become available @ a reasonable price,( I looked for it about 1 year or so ago, & it was nearly $150)I could not wait to get it! It is slightly corny, but the helicopter chase scenes are probably the best ever put on film, it has a fairly good story line, & is quite interesting, w/some nice twists!

I would gladly recommend this film, esp. if you like chase scenes(& helicopters)& when the bad guys have the good GUY outnumbered, a totaly unexpected ending!",1130284800,7,591,4.324324324324325
545587,3,6303060218,"I didn't catch this movie is its original TV run in 1973 but instead saw it on a local re-run in 1978. (It was also one of the first things I ever recorded on my new--and hyper-expensive--Panasonic VHS recorder.)

I was touched by the movie's theme about a man who, wistful for his days as a World War 2 fighter pilot in the Flying Tigers, slogs along as a chopper pilot doing traffic reports for a radio station.

Suddenly, witnessing a bank robbery in progress, he has a chance to become a hero again. The Hero As Wounded Romantic is a role that David Janssen played to perfection, as anyone who has seen HARRY O will agree.

As the young woman taken hostage by the bank robbers, Elayne Heilveil very nearly steals the movie from the rest of the cast, and I'm disappointed that she didn't seem to do that much after making this movie.

One thing I found annoying was the fact that some of the music in the original run was replaced by some other stuff, probably because of clearance difficulties. In particular, the original ended with a poignant rendition of ""I'll Get By"" playing over the end titles; that's been replaced by a much less touching instrumental.

As far as the digital transfer is concerned, it's not terrible, but it's not that great either. Also, there are brief biographies of Janssen and co-star Ralph Meeker, but nothing about Heilveil.",1129161600,15,1359,4.599173553719008
545588,4,6303060218,"World War II ""Flying Tiger"" veteran pilot Walker (David Janssen) embarks on an aerial duel with bank robbers across Utah's remote desert areas.  Walker discovers the robbers in the midst of a bank heist while on his daily helicopter traffic-reporter job in Salt Lake City.  He decides to pursue them after they take a young woman hostage and make their get-away in another helicopter.  The police are unable to muster air support and Walker is alone as he battles the criminals over desert canyons and open plains.  An interesting dynamic unfolds when the outlaws are revealed to be Vietnam War veterans.

""Birds of Prey"" is a made-for-TV movie and some sequences reflect the production's constrained budget, but the aerial cinematography-with some respectable stunt flying-is pretty exciting and actor David Janssen turns in a very good performance.  Overall a good feature, the first to use helicopters for an action genre, with a noble conclusion as Walker closes in on the criminals; a predecessor of other shows such as ""Skywolf"" and the movie ""Blue Thunder.""",1088294400,11,1064,5.121387283236994
545589,5,6303060218,"I was in high school when I saw this made-for-TV feature and I reluctantly took for granted, like the loss of the Preternatural Gifts, that I'd never be able to watch ""Birds of Prey"" again. And that was sad, because knowing I'd never have my dream girl, I wanted SO badly to die the way Janssen's character does in Birds of Prey.
David Janssen plays a older-middle-age helicopter traffic personality from that universe where rotary-wing aircraft pilots can deliver sparkling banter with their hands full of resisting airframe (you know, the place where Jerry Reed and Danny Glover's characters in BAT-21 and Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson's characters from Air America come from), and who also happens to be a veteran of the romantically short-lived ""Flying Tigers"" mercenary unit of World War II China (before ""Vinegar Joe"" Stilwell brought those poor guys kicking and screaming back into the U.S. Army Air Corps).
The movie then takes us fast forward to the mid-1970s, where surviving Flying Tigers have to pay bills like everyone else, and David Janssen's roguish flyboy lives a traffic report away from unromantic unemployment, sort of an accessory for his radio station's program director to justify playing 1940s swing during drive time... Janssen's only friend in the film locale (metro Salt Lake City, Utah) is a police detective  brilliantly done by Vincent Giardina (I think... someone please correct me), another tired WW II vet who has reluctantly come to terms with a world in which ""the system is the hero... "" (a tagline which he hurls at Janssen's romantic rogue throughout the movie).
Chaos intervenes when a high-tech crew of bandits pulls a Big Bank Job, taking several hundred thousand dollars and an attractive young cashier (I think we're talking about Sian Allen here, but I can't remember for sure) and gets away in... a chopped, channeled, stretched, primer-gray, numberless CHOPPER!
Janssen's own bird happens to be in the area of the holdup, and he immediately vectors into the airspace of the robbery, chasing the bad guys and getting his Hughes 500 (better known to Army chopper bureaucrats as the LOH-6 ""Cayuse"" and to guys who actually flew them as the ""Loach"" (an aural rendering of the acronym ""LOH"" for ""Light Observation Helicopter"") shot up for his trouble...
After the initial bawling back and forth over the radio between Janssen, his cop buddy and Everyone Else, the radio station management decides to roll with the punches and makes Janssen's chase of the Bad Guys into a media event, newsies back at the radio station cheer Janssen on as he flashes back to his own glory days, hammering Zeroes and getting his big, ugly, lethal Curtiss Warhawk hammered (the flashback scenes feature great blends of movie footage of Warhawks in battle interspersed with realistic B/W shots of Janssen's character at the yoke).
Eventually Janssen forces the bad guys down, gets into an improbable gun battle (a hunter stuck in gridlock outside Salt Lake impulsively gives a temporarily grounded Janssen his over-and-under shotgun) and gets away with both the money and the girl - and becomes the pursued, gets cornered in a canyon-and-cave system in the Utah badlands, succumbs to the sexual tension between himself and the naive, girlish cashier... then patches his plane up, leaves the girl in safety and flies the money away to distract the crooks from the girl.
I won't give away more of the film than this, except to say that Janssen's character eventually has to save his friend (afoot, running away and stumbling under chopper downdraft) from being mowed down by the bad guys in their chopper, the Janssen character screams in rage, and the scene shifts to black and white footage of a Curtiss Warhawk diving flatout at a Japanese fighter, cannons blazing... the background music track croons ""...but what care I... as long as I... have youuuuu..."" and THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the best damn heroic death scene EVER shot in a made-for-TV movie.
And twenty-five years later... well, William Faulkner once said ""You know, the men who dream of defending an abstraction with their blood haven't quite died out after the age of fifteen.""  (See the liner notes on Jimmy Buffett's ""Somewhere Over China"" for the accurate, complete quote).  For guys like us, this is the movie you want to play for your date after she makes you sit through ""Hope Floats"" or some similar nonsense.  Easily the best thing in which David Janssen ever appeared.",1004140800,19,4471,4.981258366800535
545659,4,6303060218,"As a long time fan of the late, great David Janssen, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in this film.

Although some of the acting and dialog are 'cheesy' and seem contrived watching it now, that's the case with a lot of movies from the 70's era.

On the plus side, the mid-air action between the two helicopters is great and keeps the pace moving throughout the film.

The filming for this movie is skillful and makes the aerial scenes and piloting of the helicopters (especially by Janssen) believable. But as some reviewers have mentioned, some of the music has been changed from the original TV version and this did detract from the movie overall.

I did not like the ending either. I can think of an alternative that would have been more satisfying to the viewer.  Won't mention more on this as it would be a spoiler!",1389052800,,824,4.578231292517007

545661,2,6303060218,"This movie was released in 1973 primarily for TV, not a theatrical release.  With respect to acting, cast and production quality it was done on a very limited budget, so it is really not fair to compare it to bigger budget Hollywood pictures.  One of the ways that the defunct  Tomorrow Entertainment chose to save production money was to only license the 1940s music used in the film for a very short number of years (I believe 10 years). The cost savings move by shorter music licensing was hailed by the entertainment industry back in 1973 as an example of thinking outside of the box, but since the music in this movie was so very much a part of the tone and theme of the movie, this means that the impact of the VHS, Beta and DVD versions is disappointing, because the original soundtrack is not there.  You have to remember that home video systems like Beta, BetaMax, VHS and DVD really did not exist until years afterwards.  What did exist was expensive and not for the average consumer in 1972-1973. Video systems were bulky, reel-to-reel and required a vidicon tube camera to record.  Color recording was damn expensive.  It is not surprising that the executive producer had no thoughts at the time of a home release product.  Home video recording and playback technology was still years away and would not be affordable or mass marketable for years.  By the time it was affordable and mass marketable, the permission (license) to use the original music had expired.

The movie has some terrific flying scenes. I've flown both helicopters and fix wing aircraft and helped develop military flight simulators in the 1980s, and my hats are off in respect for the stunt pilots on this movie.  This particular movie actually inspired me to work in the aerospace industry in the 1980s.

It is a decent movie with a decent plot and acceptable acting and interesting characters.  Janssen and Meeker play well off of each other.  Although the music is dramatically different than what was originally used, I still have this in my DVD collection.  I do wish that I could find out who sang ""I'll Get By"" in the original soundtrack.  She was a superb singer who was better than the others I have heard  singing that same song.",1377734400,3,2223,4.688144329896907
545662,2,6303060218,"This is a film with fine acting by the late David Janssen.  He plays an ex WW II pilot who has never quite been able to escape the war or the World War II era. Thirty years later he is a helicopter pilot for a news station, but the sadness never leaves him.  Janssen captures this sad, man-out-of-his-time quality very well, and it is the main reason that this made-for-TV flic was as good as it was.  I say 'was' because the DVD version has successfully destroyed Janssen's performance by shredding the WW II music soundtrack, which Janssen played off of to enhance his performance.  The helicopter action scenes, however, remain very good.",1365465600,2,641,4.646017699115045

I just ordered this DVD version even though the soundtrack is apparently still altered...it is still a very good David Janssen movie and a classic action film from 70's TV (I believe it was a made for TV movie). Great story line and helicopter chase sequences, the ending is still a heartbreaker (I'll not give it away!). If you've never seen this, it is definitely worth the price and I'm glad I've found it available on DVD. If you've seen it before and don't think you want it with the altered soundtrack, it is still worth the price as it is a great movie...I think at this point the original version is probably lost forever...except for those of us lucky enough to have recorded it off TV and still have our old VHS tapes!",1213142400,7,1050,4.417525773195877

One day, he spots an armored car robbery downtown and intervenes, tracking the robbers and a female hostage to a parking garage, thinking he has them...until an Aerospatiale Lama surfaces and plucks the baddies away. This is where filming gets VERY good.

As the cat-and-mouse chase progresses into the barren hills and canyons (after intercepting a fuel tanker on the highway and topping off), Janssen eventually 'gets the girl' and after some nostalgic, corny dialogue, he gets her and most of the money to safety. But soon the chase resumes and proceeds to an abandoned airfield, where another baddie awaits with a Cessna 206 to help the other baddies flee. Janssen's police chief buddy flies to the airfield as well to intercept, but is pinned down by gunfire from the Lama...until Janssen decides to redeem himself and ram the baddies with his chopper, ending everything.

...well, almost. As the police chief rues the loss of a friend in the tragedy, the last baddie flees the control tower, fires up the Cessna and makes for his escape. Resultingly, the chief and his Piper Arrow pilot pursue the Cessna into the setting sun, and yet another chase is underway as the end credits quietly roll. The only real disappointment is that in VHS and DVD incarnations, the songs ""Three Little Fishies"" and ""I'll Get By"" have been replaced by Public Domain big-band numbers that do it less justice.

Like the sequel, ""Deadly Encounter"", the helicopter flight footage is second-to-none.

Having read the reviews of the DVD I think you will appreciate my contribution. The original cinema release was a second feature to something I can't even remember - such is the powerful memory of this absolute gem of a film. Davd Janssen has always been my favourite television actor and it came as a great surprise to see this film come up on the big screen. His performance - so brilliantly capturing his poignant longing for the old days of WW2 - and now only being employed on traffic reporting from his helicopter. It is on a routine flight he spots a robbery and gives chase. The aerial scenes of the helicopters are stunning. But it is Janssen and his character that give the movie real heart and poigniancy. But the key to the film is the music links to his WW2 past. Yes 'Three Little Fishes' but chiefly 'I'll Get By' - a 4o's classic beautifully sung by a female vocalist. Also the ending - which i won't spoil - has this over the credits reducing me to tears. However, I was so excited when this film came on television (probably made as a tv movie originally and then given a theatrical release). -- but with the original music replaced. It was such a let down. I am grateful to other reviewers for helping me to understand why these changes were made. So like the rest of you - no thanks, I won't be buying the DVD. I am still trying to find out who did the vocal for 'I'll Get By' in the movie. The television airing must have been about 44 years ago.",1414195200,,1567,4.297297297297297

This tale is told with helicopters and the flying of them as well as the scenery. Starring David Janseen as hero Harry Walker, Ralph Meeker as former Flying Tiger buddy to Walker now a technocrat Jim McAndrew and Elayne Heilveil as hostage Teresa Jane.

Traffic reporter Walker spies a bank robbery in progress and is soon in pursuit of the escape car flying his Hughes 500 down the streets of Salt Lake City  most often below street lamp level and even through underpasses (and NOT at a walking pace). Later we see him flying within and through hangars at former Wendover AAF* as well as knocking a bad guy off his feet with the left skid (great stunt work as it looks real, no CGI and no bad timing such as the robber falling much before arrival of the helicopter).

Soon, Walker is in pursuit of a mean looking bad guy helicopter. Wasp-like it looks like an Arospatiale Aloutte II but is in fact a high altitude hybrid of an Aloutte II and Aloutte III made for hot as well as high altitude conditions. This variant is the Arospatiale SA315B Lama and is perfect for flying in Utah.

Once the chase is joined by Walker they are quickly flying within the red rock country found in the Moab area (in fact, Deadhorse Point is mentioned which neighbors Moab). The bare canyons are splendid with their red colored quartz sandstone strata as well as buff colored ash fall sandstone. The movie pilots of both the Lama and Hughes fly a mere few feet or less above salt flats and boulder strewn stream beds as well as landing on remote isolated canyon tops. The helicopters are made to dance and pirouette as well as fly close along steep canyon walls  the flying and the geology are spectacular to see!

Filming such as this is not likely to soon be seen as CGI is safer, and more predictable to schedule, we are afraid to say. See Birds of Prey for the treasured national scenery and minutes upon minutes of excellent helicopter piloting in two remarkable aircraft types.

As an aside, since Birds of Prey was filmed in the early 1970s, the cars are big (really big) and many of the hair cuts are either shaggy or feathered  all, perhaps, uncool today but the rage of the time (such is the fickle nature of fashion).

Wendover AAF was also used in the filming of ConAir and, more historically, served as the training base for Silverplate (the training of the B-29 crews in World War II to drop the war-ending atomic weapons) as well as Historic Wendover Airfield Museum.

7836007,1,6303060218,"Terrible re-do of an otherwise great film! The substituted ""musical score"" is just a bunch of cheap, ""WWII-era-sounding"" mishmash playing in the background, making this otherwise fine film into a cheap, clownish production. There are at least two or perhaps three scenes wherein Harry (Janssen) is flying along and his lips are flopping up and down rapidly like a fish out of water but the appropriate music isn't playing - an extremely amateurish attempt to substitute what should have been the original musical score (""Little Bitty Fishies"", if my memory serves me right...) with some garbage consisting of a ""generic"" WWII-era musical score and NO lyrics at all! There are also a few scenes that have been ""clipped"" a wee bit when compared to the original. My opinion? DON'T buy this movie - either in VHS or DVD format - UNTIL someone agrees to re-do this film as the original film, complete with the original musical score. Anything else is crap - my opinion.",1396310400,2,964,4.884146341463414
