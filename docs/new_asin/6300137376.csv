208861,5,6300137376,"This has always been a favorite of mine.  For years, I had been servant to the VHS tape that I had recorded YEARS ago in the 80's until I managed to get a VHS copy for $5 when the old Rental Store closed out.. I managed, to protect the VHS that I considered a collector's piece, to record it on a homebrew DVD for my enjoyment.  I always protected it like gold.

It is a darker children's movie that taught me several valuable lessons that I still uphold today (I never go to strange people's houses and I definitely don't drink).

Something about Unico has always stuck with me.  It was the fantasy and underlying love that was in the film; and I'm glad that it is back and available for everyone to get hold of and enjoy if they're into older dark animation.",1408406400,,760,4.25
208862,4,6300137376,"If you are expecting a ""legit"" DVD, this may not be the product for you as I have my doubts. However despite the box art print quality not being the best, the DVD itself looked and functioned professionally. It has an options menu and it plays smoothly. For entertainment, function over form is preferable and this delivers in that aspect. Purchased it as a gift for a sibling and watched it together once, and have not heard of it acting up in any way since that time.",1406592000,,469,4.402298850574713

208869,5,6300137376,"Innocent Unico (who is on the run because of jealous gods that want to keep the happiness for themselves) is forced to keep moving on by the help of the West Wind. Unico has the power to make everyone happy and he wants to be friends with everyone. As he travels he helps an imp to discover happiness and friendship and a cat who wants to become a girl. Both characters learn of their shortcomings as the story goes on.

The colors are good for a 1980's classic childrens movie. and I have rented it and love it very much. It brings back the days of innocents and we need to remember this. Of Course there is danger along the way as Unico continues his quest but he always comes through.

If you want a taste of innocents again, try this move and enjoy being a child again from the heart.

This is part one... the see part two you need to order the second movie that picks up from where this one leaves off.",1379376000,,907,4.171428571428572

I even cried when the little guy had to leave at the end.  My sister and I used to walk around the house singing the ""I'm a Cat"" song and pretend like we were licking our paws.

208905,5,6300137376,"Im a pretty big Osamu Tezuka fan and when I found out about Unico I wanted badly to see this anime. Sadly it seemed I could only find it in English Dub and was VERY excited to hear about this being re-released in both Dub and Sub.
Unico must be the cutest thing I have ever laid my eyes upon. And given that it is done by Sanrio (Hello Kitty), you know it has to be cute and well done.
The animation is great, voice acting is super and the overall movie is to die for.
If you can stand ridiculously cute anime then you'll love it!

208923,5,6300137376,"I have seen this movie dozens of times.  It was my favorite movie as a child - and still holds a special place in my heart today.  I have seen it broadcast on cable (Disney, back in the 80s), on VHS, and now, for the first time, in anamorphic widescreen.  The experience was amazing!  There are several shots that never did have their justice done in the pan and scan format, but can be seen here in all their original glory!  The original dub is here too!  This is a must, because no one could re-create the magic of this dub just as it was.  The voices of the characters are so ingrained to memory that accepting other voices would be impossible.  There are a few problems with the audio, some blaring and scratchiness here and there, but nothing horrible.  The picture has been cleaned up slightly, with some restoration done, but not overdone.  The original grain is still there, which is nice.  The release is just about perfect, especially since it was one that seemed like would never happen.  If you have ever loved UNICO then you NEED this in your collection.

The new generation of kids love it too, as I showed it to my two girls and they both adored the movie.  This is definitely a timeless classic!  Spreading kindness and happiness is a trait that never goes out of style.  Nor does caring for your friends.",1337212800,3,1322,4.445833333333334
208924,5,6300137376,"I received my copy of this and ""Island of Magic"" today. I just got finished watching 'Adventures' and I feel like I was transported back to the 80's watching my VHS copy of this over and over again.  Normally I prefer anime subtitled with original Japanese voice but for this I had to break that tradition for nostalgia's sake.

The picture is sharp and colors vibrant and it certainly been cleaned up for release although not a 100% ""restoration"" on that front, it is certainly admirable. The level of detail they put into the environments is still amazing.

The details appear to be fixed now, but when I preordered these at the beginning of April, the English audio was not listed (Only Japanese with English subtitles). I am happy to report that there IS indeed the original English audio (dub) track. While I could pretty much still recite the whole movie while watching it, I don't remember much about the quality in the original. While most dialogue comes through at a normal level, there is a bit of blare for some parts, namely the narrative in the beginning, the instrumentals and some of Beezle's parts at the beginning and Baron's voice at the end.",1336953600,4,1160,4.676470588235294
208925,5,6300137376,"I first saw this when I was only eight years old. It was my first ever experience with Anime...of course back then, I had no idea what ""anime"" was! I had seen the unicorn on the cover of this VHS tape in a small video rental shop in Miami, and asked my mom to rent it for me...what can I say, I had a thing for unicorns back in the day... ^_^ I have to admit I was very surprised by what I watched (the ending kinda scared me back then...after all, I was a child, and not used to cartoons that had serious bits to them...lol.)

Many years pass and I started getting into anime during the ""underground"" phase during the 90's and my thoughts drifted back to that small little unicorn movie I had watched as a child. But by then, I had forgotten the title of it.

Then in the 2000s, I joined an anime fan club, and after explaining the movie to someone in the club, they told me the title. Excited, I began a long (and fruitless) search for my little ""Unico"". Only foreign editions, bad quality, and bootleg versions were discovered. Frustrated, I almost gave up.

Then my wonderful husband told me today (4/8/12) to check amazon.com. I did, and saw not only the one I had been searching for: Fantastic Adventures of Unico"", but also ""Unico in the Island of Magic"" (which I never even knew existed)! I will be pre-ordering both!! I can't wait for May 15th!!",1333843200,2,1354,4.301960784313725
208926,5,6300137376,I have been looking for this movie for a very long time.  When I finally found it I just had to have it.  My mother and I both love this movie.  I remember my dad recording this off the TV for my sister and I to watch when we were young.  We loved this movie and watched it a lot.  My mother popped this into the player and it was just as I remembered it to be.  I just love this movie!,1332633600,,386,3.6463414634146343
208927,5,6300137376,"I recently purchased both ""Unico in the Island of Magic"" and ""The Fantastic Adventures of Unico"" together. ""Fantastic Adventures"" is the first of the Unico movies. I bought them not only out of childhood nostalgia, not only because I loved the movies when I was a kid, but because I knew my daughter would enjoy them.

In the film, Unico is a baby unicorn who has the unusual gift making people happy just by being there. The Gods (looks like Olympus of Greek myth) see this as a threat to their power over mankind, so they banish him and order the West Wind to throw him up on the Hill of Oblivion, to be forgotten forever. The West Wind just can't do it to the poor little guy, so she takes him to various places to keep him safe from the Gods' wrath, keeping one step ahead. During his travels, he helps various characters and kills a monster while in the form of a Pegasus.

These are great films for a fantasy or sci-fi collector, and kids will get into the action,the characters, and the animation. The only warning is that parents should either preview the movies before hand or watch it with their children the first couple of times because of the sequence in which Unico kills the monster at the castle.

As I stated in my review of the other Unico movie ""Unico in the Island of Magic"", these movies did not phase my 4 year old daughter, but all kids are different. Some kids might love it, and others may be frightened. Just fair warning.

Check them out.",1320624000,,1465,4.394833948339484

208942,3,6300137376,"THE FANTASTIC ADVENTURES OF UNICO (1981) was based on a manga (comic book) by Osamu Tezuka (""Astro Boy"") and, according to some sources, co-directed by Tezuka himself. It was produced by Sanrio, home of Hello Kitty (who makes a cameo appearance), and it tells the tale of Unico, a cute little unicorn whose horn has magical powers and allows him to bring happiness to everyone he comes into contact with. When the gods get angry at Unico for having such powers they order the West Wind to exile him. Against orders, the West Wind drops him off at the Island of the Devil of Solitude, where he encounters the cranky and mischievous little blue devil, Beezel, sole occupant of the island. Not much later, just after Unico's finally convinced Beezel to be his friend, The West Wind comes by to whisk Unico away again, and drops him in another land, where he befriends a selfish little kitten named Katy and even turns her into a human girl to fulfill her most devout wish, but only if she'll continue to help the old woman in whose house they stay.

For the first half of the film, it's traditional children's film territory as Unico befriends two disparate and flawed creatures and seeks to get the anti-social Beezel and the vain, self-absorbed Katy to learn how to care about other people. The theme of redeeming the worst among us is a common one in Tezuka's works. But then things take a dark turn in the second half as a local Baron, handsome, long-haired and devious, takes an interest in Katy and lures her to his castle, where he plies her with wine, even drugging her and putting her to bed, for what sinister purpose we never find out. There's even a scene where some cuddly forest creatures, turned evil by the Baron's magic, attack a monkey. The Baron suffers a gruesome, violent fate during his battle with Unico, but he then reveals his gargantuan demon form, which cuts a swath of great destruction through his castle and the surrounding forest, culminating in a raging fire. All of this would make the film of greater interest to older kids, say 8-to-10, while possibly scaring the 4-to-5-year-olds.

It's a tricky film to recommend to a particular age group. There's not enough dramatic interest for a teenage or adult audience except, perhaps, for the scenes of Katy in the Baron's castle. The first half is better suited for young children (4-7), while older ones would prefer the second half with its action and spectacle. Parents have to judge how well their children can take scary, monstrous material. It does get pretty exciting, though, so my guess is that most kids would eagerly stick with it. And it does have a set of positive messages.

It's very nicely animated and designed, with beautiful shots of lush, natural countrysides bedecked with flowers. It's always nice to look at, even in the parts that would try adult viewers' patience. It's done in a more neutral animation style than we usually see in Japanese animated films, one that's closer to American cartoons, with only a few trademark touches giving it away as Japanese, such as that sinister long-haired Baron, in his 18th-century outfits and baroque castle, and the resemblance of Unico to Tezuka's other great little white animated wild creature, Kimba, the White Lion.

The disc comes only with an English dub, which is too bad, since the English voices, particularly that of Beezel, are especially grating to older viewers' ears. There are also a couple of insipid English-language songs which I assume were newly recorded for the English dub and made me wish I could hear the original Japanese soundtrack. There have been other Unico films, including a direct sequel to this one, entitled UNICO IN THE ISLAND OF MAGIC (1983).",1230854400,28,3720,4.789719626168225

208944,5,6300137376,"Unlike many American children of the '80s, my first exposure to Osamu Tezuka's baby unicorn character was NOT on the Disney Channel - which at the time was a premium channel for which my parents were not willing to shell out the extra bucks. It was actually via the second movie, UNICO IN THE ISLAND OF MAGIC, which I rented from a video store in northern Michigan while vacationing there. Only recently did I get a chance to see this first Unico film - on YouTube, of all places - and I immediately fell in love with it.

Osamu Tezuka debuted the original Unico manga in Japan in 1977 in a Sanrio manga publication called ""Lyrica."" For those not familiar with the back story, Unico is a baby unicorn who has the magical power to bring happiness to everyone he meets. The gods, however, are jealous of his powers and order that he be banished to the Hill of Oblivion. The West Wind refuses to carry out the command and carries Unico away, hoping that the gods will not find him, but the gods soon learn of the deception and send the Night Wind to finish the job. Invariably the gods learn where the West Wind has hidden Unico each time, which forces the West Wind to continually take him from place to place. At each stop Unico makes new friends and has some incredible adventures, but it's always bittersweet since it's never long before Unico has to say goodbye because the gods have discovered where he is and the West Wind must take him away - without even time to say goodbye. In this first movie (which follows up a very rare 1979 pilot film, Black Cloud and White Feather), Unico befriends the lonely Beezle, a young boy devil, and grants him his own horn; then the West Wind takes him away again and he meets Katy (or Chao in the original Japanese), a black-and-white cat and aspiring witch who wants to become a human. Unico grants her wish, but then a handsome demon posing as a baron lures the naive Katy to his castle...

The animation was done by the well-known studio Madhouse, which is also known for movies like BAREFOOT GEN, THE TOKYO GODFATHERS, and PERFECT BLUE, and for TV series like TRIGUN. Some other legendary names in the anime industry show up in the credits, including Madhouse animator Yoshiaki Kawajiri and scenarist Masaki Tsuji, who also scripted episodes of Tezuka's TV series ASTRO BOY, KIMBA THE WHITE LION, and PRINCESS KNIGHT. With a strong roster of talent behind it and of course the power of Tezuka's story, this movie is consistently entertaining and moving, making this movie a lost classic.

First of all, the animation is stunning given the age of the movie (it was made originally in 1981), with incredible attention to detail. Even anime-haters will find something to like - yes, there are the expected ""big eyes"" (which, after all, was something that Tezuka pioneered), but the animation is very smooth and puts much of today's TV animation to shame - and this was probably without the help of any type of CGI. Second of all, the music, performed by an actual symphony orchestra, is beautiful and incorporates various types of styles according to the onscreen action. My favorite piece of the score is when Katy meets Baron DeGhost for the first time; we hear a slow, sensuous, ever-so-slightly-discofied backbeat that just screams ""Barry White,"" and it's unlikely that any other anime targeted at children has ever featured a piece of incidental music such as this. As for the voice acting, I have seen bits and pieces of the Japanese version, and alhough the Japanese is slightly better (especially when it comes to Katy and the baron), the English audio track is excellent as well; Unico, Beezle and the old lady (according to IMDB, the old lady's English VA is the legendary June Foray) are all voiced very well.  In fact, Unico's English VA sounds a lot like Pinky from the TV series NOOZLES (FUSHIGI NA KOALA BLINKY), and given that the voice actors in the English version were frequently used by Saban (who dubbed NOOZLES for America) in the '80s, it could very well be.  Oh, and there are songs too, which were actually dubbed for the U.S. version - same melodies as the original Japanese but with English lyrics. The one exception to this is the closing credits song which for some unfortunate reason was changed to an instrumental.

With all that said, there are definitely more mature elements in this movie that would make it difficult to show on American TV today without some editing. I've heard that the Disney Channel removed it from rotation for violence, but there really isn't much violence in this movie. However, there is Baron DeGhost trying to get Katy drunk and take advantage of her - even in the English dub, the liquid Katy drinks is ""wine"", and wasn't redubbed to ""grape juice"" or something moronic like that as in other anime dubs since (hello, ONE PIECE as dubbed by 4Kids). For those reasons and also for the reason that the last half-hour or so of the movie - chronicling Unico's efforts to rescue Katy - can get quite scary, parents of young children might want to view this film themselves before they let their kids watch it, but there really isn't much in it that's objectionable for older kids. It's mature enough, in fact, that adults can watch it and enjoy it without feeling like their teeth are being rotted with cloying sugariness (I loved it, and I'm 27). And also, the ending is not an entirely happy one (at least it isn't for Unico); in fact, it may leave you in tears.

And here's the best news ever for Unico fans in the United States: our favorite baby unicorn is finally on his way to a legitimate American DVD release! Unico's status in America was in limbo for years after Osamu Tezuka's death in 1989, when the rights to Unico passed from Sanrio to Tezuka's own company which had no distribution arm in the U.S.  But now a company called ""New Galaxy Anime"" plans to release both Unico films on DVD, reportedly with both the English and Japanese audio tracks! I know I will buy both.

Osamu Tezuka may be best known in America for ASTRO BOY, but THE FANTASTIC ADVENTURES OF UNICO is a fine piece of work as well and a true anime classic. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but anime fans should like it and perhaps even non-fans will enjoy it too.",1194566400,,6247,4.595515695067265
208945,5,6300137376,"i first watched this movie when i was 5 yrs old and i used to watch it every day , then my eldest sister threw it away after couple of months(because i didn't allow her to watch anything else) and as i remember i didn't stop crying at that time and i didn't stop searching & thinking about it since then

 until i became 21yrs old i started searching for it through the internet but the problem was that i thought it was called unicorn so i spent 2 yrs getting more and more confused but i didn't give up although i used to shop through amazon for 2yrs now and (i love shopping through it) but it didn't cross my mind that it is available until yesterday

 so i cried because i loved it its my favourite movie i ordered it yesterday and i cant wait to watch it imagine about 20 yrs thinking of it i wish it will be available on DVD soon

as i remeber it was about a baby unicorn (unico) was born with other colorful unicorns, he was sweet, kind and loyal he loved his friends and when he is in danger he gets bigger having wings he was the most beautiful unicorn i ever saw thats why i couldn't forget it, he is there for his friends when they need him a girl and another blue small unicorn and i remember there were two goddess one is evil one trying to snatch unico from the good goddess who is trying to protect him

i advise everyone to watch it its the best i really cant wait TO WATCH IT AGAIN",1181865600,,1399,4.0324909747292415
208946,5,6300137376,"Unico is far much more than just a cute-looking animal and posseses a sweet noble disposition that I've noticed in other Anime characters. In times of trouble they don't burst out into song like Disney characters do or start talking to the trees. They persevere with great determination to face the world regardless of whatever obstacles come their way.

I found Tezuka's film straightforward and charming in contrast to some of the epic action-packed Miyazaki films like ""Castle in the Sky"" or ""Princess Mononoke"". Miyazaki movies are great in themselves but ""The Adventures of Unico"" is a slower and simpler change of pace.

Summary: Unico is a baby unicorn blessed with the power to make people happy. The gods don't think such a gift should belong to a unicorn so they order the West Wind, a beautiful shimmering white spirit, to dispose of Unico. Instead she leaves him on an abandoned island where he befriends a stubborn little devil, meets a wishful cat, and has other amazing adventures. The film sounds like it should be sickeningly sweet to the point of annoying but instead, it flows with grace and gentleness.

Unico is the epitome of Anime cuteness as a cuddly baby unicorn with big blue eyes. But he's not completely naive or helpless. Unico gently chastises his friends when they do wrong against others or to themselves. If they are in danger, Unico charges into battle and uses his magical horn to defeat any adversary in his path.

His friends are less-than-perfect but colorful and entertaining: a prickly l'il devil named Bezel and a headstrong cat named Katie. But Unico's goodness gradually influences and they find themselves helping him through his adventures.

Transformations are also popular in Anime and here they work almost Grimm-esq in fairy tale style. There are ""good"" transformations such as Unico using his magic to turn Katie into a bishojo (Japanese for ""pretty girl"") with large green eyes, a pink dress, and little red slippers. The ""bad"" transformation comes in Baron De Ghost, who appears as a charming nobleman to Katie but in his true form is a monster. The finale introduces the popular ""power-up"" transformation where the hero reveals his greatest form. Unico becomes a full-fledged grown unicorn who is strong enough to vanquish his enemies.

When I was six years old, many of the darker cartoons used to entertain and disturb me simultaneously including ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"", and ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"". But the Unico films never scared me. Maybe I just knew that he'd get up and save the day so I wasn't afraid of any grotesque monsters or creeping shadows that came onto the screen. But I never had to cover my eyes from watching the movie. On the contrary, I loved ""The Adventures of Unico"" from a very small age.

It's a magical film about the triumph of good over evil, loving-kindness over selfishness, and perseverance over despair.  I recommend this movie to kids and adults alike and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",1157673600,21,3014,4.8501945525291825

208949,5,6300137376,"Unico is born in a beautiful forest along with a few others.  He has the power to bring joy and happiness to everyone around him, which makes the gods very jealous.  So the gods send the West Wind to take Unico to the Hill of Oblivion.  But the West Wind is a very kind being, and cannot bring herself to do it, so she leaves him instead in a misty rocky place in hopes that the gods won't notice him.
  Unico awakens all alone.  He tries to make friends with the Devil of Solitude, but the devil gets angry.  It knocks down a bunch of columns and one smashes him.  Then Unico hears crying, so he investigates, and meets Beasel.  Beasel says that he is the son of the Devil of Solitude.  Unico tries to befriend him, but Beasel says that he will only be his friend if he gives him his horn.  Unico refuses, so Beasel leaves.  But later, Beasel gets lonely and befriends Unico, who then gives him the horn.  Beasel accidentally pushes Unico off of a cliff and into the sea, and then won't go save him.  But his conscience gets the better of him, and he gives himself an excuse to rescue Unico, even though he may die in the process.  So he gives Unico his horn, and Unico turns into Adult Unico and saves Beasel.  Unico then tells Beasel that the only reason he was able to save him is because they love each other, and gives Beasel a horn of his own  After that incident, the gods realize that Unico is on the Island of Solitude, and send the Night Wind to bring Unico to the Hill of Oblivion, but the West Wind finds out and gets there first, bringing him to a river this time.  He hears singing, and falls into a basket with Katy, the cat, who was also abandoned. Katy wants to be a witch, and so they go looking for a witch.  They come to an old cottage with an old woman in it, and Katy tries to tell her to make her a human, but the woman doesn't understand her.  Unico then turns Katy into a human, but Katy thinks that the old woman did it.  She helps the old woman out, but then tires of it and leaves.  Unico tells Katy that he was the one who turned her into a human, and she doesn't believe him.  He says that he doesn't like her anymore, and turns her back into a cat, but when Katy the cat tries to save the old woman when she fell into the river, Unico turns her back into a human again.
  One day, Katy is singing by the river, and a beautiful man asks her to come and sing at his castle.  She is delighted!  The next day she sneaks out, and accidentally eats an enchanted strawberry, which puts her in a trance.  She goes to the Baron's castle. Unico follows her. He goes to fight the Baron, and the Baron is impaled (gross) on a spire.  He then turns into a huge demon, and sends a river of fire and lava after everyone.  Unico and Beasel battle the Baron, but Unico loses his horn and falls. Katy and Beasel both say that they would give up the gifts that Unico gave them if only he would live.

The story follows Unico, a young unicorn with the special gift of making everyone he meets happy.  The gods become jealous of this and command the West Wind to banish him to the Hill of Oblivion where Unico will be forever forgotten.  The West Wind takes pity on Unico and instead, leaves him places she believes the gods will not see him.
