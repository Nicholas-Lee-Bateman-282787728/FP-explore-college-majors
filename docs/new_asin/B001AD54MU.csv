8276701,1,B001AD54MU,"It seemed back in the swinging 60s everybody was making spy films, trying to capitalize on the success of the James Bond movies starring Sean Connery. Some like Deadlier Than The Male are quite good. And the spoofs like the Derek Flint series are quite entertaining. But avoid Lightning Bolt at all costs. I had seen trailers for this film before and was never moved to buy it. But judo fanatic that I am I couldn't resist the movie's poster with the leotard-clad blonde tossing a black-garbed baddie over her back. I should have just bought a copy of the poster. This movie is the worst. Hero Anthony Eisley(the former star of television's Hawaiin Eye)walks through this flick doing his best Tony Kendall impersonation,but he doesn't have Kendall's smarmy charm. The special effects aren't very special and the fight scenes are mediocre. The villian comes across as a lame Goldfinger wannabe and the movie moves at a snail's pace. The women are attractive enough,but that's to be expected even in a film of this calibre. This doesn't even qualify as camp. And to top it all off the copy I purchased was washed out.",1264204800,6,1115,4.752577319587629
