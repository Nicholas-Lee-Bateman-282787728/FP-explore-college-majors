2224562,5,B0007OP17G,I went to this event and it was great. There was KO there was submissions and there was Action! I would recommend this DVD to anyone. There were 3 main events and 2 title fights! The fight between Tito and Vitor has been anticipated for years. You will love this UFC DVD!,1110412800,7,271,4.230769230769231
8049672,5,B0007OP17G,"To say the least, the MMA world was shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the loss of former UFC Middleweight Champion, Evan Tanner. And to say the least, UFC 51 was Evan Tanner's night! And in the beginning of the show, a show where there are two title fights, it just happens to be HIS fight that doesn't get a gladiator introduction! WHY? In shows where there have been two or more big fights, they've had three gladiator introductions. One of two co-main events, he's taking on David Terrell. David Terrell made his UFC debut in UFC 49, and he didn't just take out, he knocked out Matt ""The Law"" Lindland in UNDER 25 seconds. Evan Tanner? He's just been around, and he's fought the best in the business. He deserved this shot. Both of these guys wanted the vacant Middleweight belt.

With Frank Mir injured, there was an interim Heavyweight title on the line. And to fight for it was the beginning of a trilogy that began that will long be remembered! Tim Sylvia taking on Andrei Arlovski was a big deal! Tim's prediction was simple, ""I'm gonna knock his ass out."" To which Arlovski would simply reply, ""Tim, good luck.""

The main event of this proved to be interesting. Tito Ortiz taking on Vitor Belfort, two former UFC champions. Which one would prevail and continue with a career in the UFC? Tito's thoughts were which Vitor would show up to fight. Vitor simply said that Tito has a big mouth, and his job is to fight, not to talk.

Two of those fights were featured on the gladiator introductions, and in the end, it should've been all three! But altogether there are 9 fights, and I didn't think any of them were boring. I'll list those fights below.

Nick Diaz vs. Drew Fickett: This is Fickett's UFC debut, hoping he can shut down the cocky Diaz. This fight ends in the first round.

Chris Lytle vs. Karo Parisyan: Two veterans who like to really bring it! It goes to a unanimous decision!

David Louiseau vs. Gideon Ray: A seasoned striker with some razor sharp elbows welcomes a newcomer! That ends due to cuts at the end of the first round.

James Irvin vs. Mike Kyle: Newcomer, undefeated Irvin thinks that Kyle's a prick! That's what he said in his pre-fight interview. And this ends with a KO in the first round.

Paul Buentello vs. Justin Eilers: Eilers impressed in his UFC debut, but what about this Buentello guy? After a first round KO, the message is delivered, ""Don't fear me, fear the consequences!""

Evan Tanner vs. David Terrell: When we say that this is Evan Tanner's night, the winner is probably obvious. Evan Tanner will be missed by many fans.

Tim Sylvia vs. Andrei Arlovski: The first of three fights between these two warriors ends in less than a minute!

Phil Baroni vs. Pete Sell: The New York Bad Ass doesn't like Serra's golden boy. This is somewhat of a surprise ending near the end of the 3rd round.

Tito Ortiz vs. Vitor Belfort: A tough fought split decision, they were both there to fight.

In the end, two champions were crowned. Evan Tanner will always be remembered on the night of UFC 51, Super Saturday!!!",1222646400,,3056,4.544626593806922
8049673,5,B0007OP17G,"I enjoyed this event pretty much from start to finish, and I highly recommend it. All of the pre-fight interviews with the individual fighters are included.",1185235200,,156,5.038461538461538
8049674,1,B0007OP17G,Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.,1152489600,,179,4.741935483870968
8049675,1,B0007OP17G,"UFC 51 is a joke of an event, especially the main event.  The decision in the Tito/Belfort fight is atrocious and robs the rightful victory of the win, leaving a bitter taste in your mouth.  You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.

Pride FC is the top organization in the world.  Sadly, the UFC is far behind.",1152403200,2,403,4.333333333333333
8049676,5,B0007OP17G,"Super Saturday was quite an event.  To be honest, I was more interested in seeing some of the undercard fights than the Belfort/Ortiz fight.  I've seen enough of both of them at this point, especially Tito Ortiz - and after the fight, you will see precisely why in how he carries on in the ring.  He makes a practice of acting like a fool in the octagon that he speaks so highly of, making it difficult to respect him.  He was already on his way out at this point.

In this UFC event, we see Arlovski continue his rise, Tanner surprise the crowd, Baroni continue to slip down the ladder and Buentelo make his opening statement for an eventual title shot.  It was entertaining as hell and the standout star was most certainly Andrei Arlovski.  He suffered a knockout at the hands of Pedro Rizzo a while back and he has yet to taste defeat since.  He is truly an entertaining fighter, as he has the ability to end a match quickly in a variety of ways.  I look forward to seeing more of him in the future.",1141171200,4,1002,4.287234042553192
8049677,5,B0007OP17G,"If you have ever been on an MMA forum, you would no doubt have come across a raging debate over who should have been given the decision in the main event of UFC 51. I have watched it many times, and being a fan of both fighters I have to say that each and every time I see it I have to agree with the decision. It was a great fight from another great night of fights. I highly recommend this event... it is worth watching repeatedly!",1139443200,2,433,3.9885057471264367
8049678,4,B0007OP17G,"Andrei Arlovski is an extremely well rounded heavyweight with exceptional striking skills and great submissions.  He is one of the best fighters in the world today.  He is also entertaining with those artificial Dracula teeth.  He can't do a good interview though, and has trouble with the language.

His opponent is former UFC heavyweight champ Tim Sylvia, who outweighs him by a lot, and is just a much taller and bigger man.  Sylvia is a hard hitter but does not have Arlovski's grappling skills or hand speed.

Vitor Belfort and Tito Ortiz are both former UFC champions in the light heavyweight division.  Belfort is younger, in his mid 20s, and his greatest strength is hand speed.  He is very explosive and has a good ground game.  Ortiz is a tough guy, a ground and pounder and a slugger.  He has an outgoing and brash personality and a dyed blonde crewcut.  He challenges Ken Shamrock and Chuck Liddell, and brings them both into the ring.

I'd call those four fighters, Arlovski, Sylvia, Belfort and Ortiz, the stars of UFC 51.  David Loiseau is quick and a great striker, Paul Buentello is a heavy handed bomber, and Evan Tanner is an experienced pro.  There are also some good up and coming fighters on the show.

The main thing I will say about this show is that Arlovski is something else.  He has the kind of excitement and talent that really stands out.  The Belfort-Ortiz match suffers in comparison because Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell stole their thunder in the LH division, and you can tell by the way Belfort and Ortiz fight.  It isn't anywhere near as explosive or exciting as the amazing Arlovski.",1128729600,4,1622,4.691489361702128
8049679,5,B0007OP17G,"Tito Ortiz and Vitor Belfort had an early match of the year contender. Great battle with Ortiz trying to implement his ground and pound whilst Belfort trying to implement his lightning fast hands. Ortiz weathered a flurry of punches in round 1 and a brutal ground and pound assault in round 2. However Belfort end of round 1 and 2 was on his back at the end of the round receiving vicious elbows. Round 3 Ortiz showed his superior cardio and ground and pounded Vitor the entire round. Ortiz got the split decision which some considered controversial. The aftermath altercation was as great as the fight itself. First involving one with Liddell and then a super heated one with Ken Shamrock.

Arlovski v Sylvia was shocking as it was a short fight, he was able to knock down Sylvia with a single punch and then submit him. People forget his got a background in Sambo.

Tanner v Terrell was great and edge of the seat stuff. Especially when Terell nearly choked Tanner out with a gilotine. Tanner remarkably came out and ground and pounded him into a referee stoppage. Terrell was extremely hyped up especially the fact he knocked out Matt Lindland very quicky in his UFC debut and his a Cesar Gracie product.

Kyle v Irwin was a simple case of Kyle being too big and too strong. Irwin really belongs in the light heavyweight division.

Eilers v Buentello was exciting as everyone was expecting big things for Eilers since he knocked out Mike Kyle in last fight. Buentello showed great stand up skills on verge to victory.",1122508800,2,1520,4.639405204460966
8049680,5,B0007OP17G,"UFC 51 was a great PPV, and a great DVD.  My personal favorite match is Paul Buentello's debut in the UFC facing Justin Eilers.

I would go into detail like the review below me, but since they already did that I don't see the point.  From an MMA fan to an MMA fan, GREAT buy.",1121731200,2,275,3.963636363636364
8049681,4,B0007OP17G,"In 51, the UFC continued it's tradition of great shows. Matchmaker Joe Silva deserves kudos for this show.
It had a little of everything, KOs, Submissions and a couple of hard fought bouts that went to a decision.

We saw the UFC debut of 5 fighter. 2 champions were also crowned, something that was long overdue. We now have champions in 4 weight classes after being down to just 2 a short while ago. We are also treated to what may have very well been Tito Ortiz's final fight in the UFC, as he takes on The Phenom Vitor Belfort.
  -Nick Diaz(9-3) vs. Drew Fickett(21-2)
Nick is coming off a very close split decision loss to Karo Parisyan. Drew Fickett is making his UFC debut.
  -Karo Parisyan(12-3) vs. Chris Lytle(16-10-5)
Karo comes into this fight looking to establish a claim for a Welterweight title shot. His only loses are to Georges St. Pierre and Sean Sherk, 2 top 10 fighters. Chris Lytle is far better than his record suggests, he is 8-2 in his last 10 fights coming into this.
  -David Loiseau(11-4) vs. Joe Riggs did not take place. Joe Riggs had to drop out and was replaced by Gideon Ray(8-1-1).
This is Loiseau's first UFC fight in 1 & 1/2 years and Gideon is making his UFC debut.
  -Mike Kyle(7-3) vs. James Irwin(7-0)
Kyle is coming off a brutal KO at the hands of Justin Eilers, while Irwin is looking to make a impact in his UFC debut.
  -Paul Buentello(16-7) vs. Justin Eilers(9-2-1)
This heavyweight bout sees Paul in his first UFC fight against a very hard hitting Eiler. 2 very serious sluggers.
  -Evan Tanner(28-3) vs. Dave Terrell(5-1) for Middleweight championship. Tanner always seems to be the underdog, but is 3-0 since dropping to the Middleweight class.
Terrell is fighting for the title in only his second UFC match, thanks to an amazing KO of superstar Matt Lindland.
  -Andrei Arlovski(6-3) vs. Tim Sylvia(16-1) for interim Heavyweight title. Heavyweight champ Frank Mir is out after being seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. So Arlovski and Sylvia are fighting to be the interim champ. Mir will have to fight the interim champ when he returns to unify the 2 belts. Alovksi is undeated in the last 2 years while Sylvia is coming off his only defeat, which was at the hands of Frank Mir.
  -Pete Sell(4-0) vs. Phil Baroni(5-4). Was supposed to be Robbie Lawler/Baroni but Lawler suffered an injury training.
This is Sell's first time in the octogon while Baroni has lost 3 in a row and is in dire need of a win.
  -Tito Ortiz(11-4) vs. Vitor Belfort(12-4).
Both of these guys are at the end of their UFC contract and certainly want an impressive win to better their position with the UFC.
For those of you that watched the card live, I will say that the post main event confrontations are here, unedited.
