1674768,3,B00005Y6Z7,"Glen Campbell is no longer thirtysomething.  He has matured and some things have changed.  His voice for one.  On this disc it is much more nasal than when in his prime.  He just doesn't sing as well as he used to.  On the other hand, he is still a gifted guitar player and an enjoyable entertainer.  I passed up seeing Glen live eralier this month and bought this disc instead.  From the current level of his performances, as documented on this disc...  This disc is not for those wanting to hear Mr. Campbell the way he sounded on his Goodtime Hour.",1017014400,2,551,4.3861386138613865
1674769,4,B00005Y6Z7,Good disk.  Worth the money.  He does a song with his daughter! The interviews with Glen and others was also informative.  I'll watch this one again soon.,1016668800,4,154,4.62962962962963
1674790,4,B00005Y6Z7,"What you have here is later-era Glen Campbell, after his unmatchable '60s/early '70s prime, but also after the really unfortunate late '70s-'80s era, when Glen was still working through his demons, the hits had dried up, and by any standard whatsoever live Glen was just phoning it in. (Very little guitar work, lots of lousy medlies of the hits, not much conviction in the singing).

By the time this show was recorded, Glen had cleaned up and he was once again obviously engaged with the music. And, somewhat surprisingly but most happily so, his voice is in very good shape, and he's still amazing on the guitar.

So what you have, then, is Glen when he had started to care again. And thank god for that. It's so nice to hear him sing the songs like they matter, and to sing them really well. He tries for, and hits, the hard notes. He takes a number of melodic guitar solo excursions that are wonderful to watch and which still serve the music.

And the orchestra is terrific.

On top of all this, the concert is extremely well recorded--both the picture and sound are top notch.

There are other live performances of some of these songs that are as good or better, and there are songs I wish were included here but aren't. But ounce for ounce, this is assuredly the very best  live document of a full Glen Campbell concert that exists.

Any fan of Campbell (and, really, if you aren't, you should be...) really needs this.

PBS should reissue this post haste.",1433289600,2,1464,4.5399239543726235

1674793,5,B00005Y6Z7,Love it. Wish PBS would re-release this. Deserves more than 5 stars. An incredible artist/singer/musician backed up by a spectacular orchestra. I never really appreciated orchestra until I watched this concert. Only wish I had followed Glen's career more closely through the years but there is plenty of material to catch up on. Thank you Glen for creating such a great legacy. I am sure the heavens smiled the day you first picked up a guitar and sang. And thanks to Jimmy Webb for the wonderful songwriting.,1416700800,,509,4.862068965517241

1674799,5,B00005Y6Z7,"These are timeless songs and will remain popular classics long after Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb are gone. This is a superb DVD for any longtime Glen Campbell fan and for guitar afficionados worldwide. That it's commercial free, having been recorded on PBS in South Dakota, is simply a bonus. The picture is high quality, and the sound is marvelous. I'm so glad a friend told me about this concert so I could find it on Amazon.com. I'll never discard this recording.",1378425600,3,467,4.7073170731707314
1674800,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Glen Campbell is often overlooked when people talk about great performers. He has been a big influence on many other performers. This concert shows how great Glen is with his guitar playing and singing. This concert was done for PBS and the original air time was about 1 hour so they cut to the credits after 1 hour before the concert ended. However, the additional songs from the concert are included in the extras. I wish they would have just shown the entire concert as it took place instead of cutting away to the credits and then making us go to the extras to finish the concert.",1365465600,,584,4.4672897196261685
1674801,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Too bad Glen's fans who only recently found out about this concert are unable to purchase it because of the DVDs cost.

1674804,5,B00005Y6Z7,"This is a classic concert performance by Glen that showcases many of his classic country hits--Wichita Lineman, Gentle on My Mind, By the Time I Get to Phoenix, Galveston, Rhinestone Cowboy--and his guitar mastery on instrumentals Classical Gas and William Tell Overture.  This concert performance was a PBS TV special in 2001. It's especially appreciated now a decade later since Glen is currently doing his ""Goodbye Tour"" that is being attended by his legions of fans spanning a remarkable career over the last 50 years!!  Kudos to the Rhinestone Cowboy!!",1337644800,4,557,5.177777777777778
1674805,5,B00005Y6Z7,"My dear wife gave me this concert for our anniversary.  Simply put---I love it!  I love good guitar playing, whether it is the classical guitar of Julian Bream, the jazz guitar of George Benson, or the first rate playing of Glen Campbell.  This concert has so much to offer.

First, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra is very good.  An orchestra really rounds out the kind of songs that Mr. Campbell performs.  I love the string section of an orchestra.  They add such beauty to his performance of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix.""  That performance is truly beautiful!

He performs the ""William Tell Overture.""  He tells of being a little boy and seeing The Lone Ranger in a movie theatre in Arkansas. He said that Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels were his first Western movie heroes.  As he  says, ""They were really something.""  While I am significantly younger than Mr. Campbell, I totally agree with him.  I loved The Lone Ranger as a little boy.  To this day I love the ""William Tell Overture.""  It is definitely one of my favorite musical compositions.  I can't listen to it and not smile.  He plays it on the guitar with the orchestra.  It is wonderful!

He performs many of his popular songs: ""Wichita Lineman,"" ""Gentle on My Mind,"" ""Rhinestone Cowboy,"" and ""Galveston.""

If you like Glen Campbell, then this concert is a must.  It is wonderful, and I expect to watch it over and over again.  I suspect you will too.",1324684800,3,1424,4.608
1674806,5,B00005Y6Z7,"All of the songs are familiar to me from days gone by. But I had no idea that Glen Campbell was such a good guitar player. I was shocked.

An outstanding performance from start to finish. Beautifully captured on DVD.",1316217600,,216,4.4
1674807,5,B00005Y6Z7,"We first saw this DVD at my brother's place and it was a ""must have""!!!  We got the name of the DVD from him and started hunting!!!  We found all the reviews on this site really helpful, especially an unexpected comment about it no longer being available in NZ.  So we ordered through Amazon with no further delay and in record time here's the DVD, beautifully packaged, and in brand new condition.  We had a lovely evening enjoying all our favourite Glen Campbell songs with my 80 year old mother, and honestly it was just like being at the concert.  What a treat!  This is a DVD we can recommend without hesitation.  You will want to watch it over and over!",1309737600,3,659,4.396694214876033

we appreciated it that the recording was filled with favorite Campbell songs and not a lot of dialogue.",1285113600,,159,4.714285714285714
1674809,5,B00005Y6Z7,Glen is a master with the guitar and with the South Dokota symphony behind him his singing is excellent. The dvd is full of vey good songs and arrangements and one I highly reccomend. I wish It's Only Make Believe would have been included. Excellent gutars solos by Glen on Galveston and Try A Little Kindness. Gilbert Campagna,1283558400,,327,4.655172413793103
1674810,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Campbell with a full symphony is as good as it gets.
If you're middle aged, you know him best from his many top 40/crossover/county hits and his TV variety series.
Here, you get so see him as a serious musician...and a world-class guitar player.

The trick to this DVD is to enjoy the great symphony and watch his guitar skills.
Outside of attending a live Campbell concert with a symphony, this is the ultimate Campbell experience.
Watch and listen and you'll come away with a greater appreciation of his talent.",1277596800,5,513,4.7
1674811,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Mixing Glen, his band, and the South Dakota Symphony was true brilliance!  This is a just tribute to one of our finest musical legends - Glen Campbell.  He plays a great variety of music, including classic hits and other beautiful songs.  It's nearly impossible to pick a favorite song out of this wonderful selection, but I would say, ""The Highwayman"", ""Still Within The Sound of My Voice,""  and ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" are 3 of my favorites.
Though my kids (in their twenties) are into their own music, they were astonished at Glen's talent and the beauty of this performance when they watched parts of this DVD with me.  This performance is the hallmark of Glen's long and wonderful career as one of music's finest.  Buy it.  You'll be glad you did!",1274400000,,759,4.619402985074627
1674812,5,B00005Y6Z7,"I bought this DVD based on a huge number of five star reviews on this website and wasn't disappointed. I grew up with music from the 70's onwards and like a lot of styles of music including mostly rock music, but Glen Campbell has always commanded my attention. Glen may have aged somewhat by the time this concert was recorded, but fortunately his voice has remained intact long enough to be recorded by modern equipment and the end result is a fantastic concert both visually and audibly. This concert is beautifully performed and recorded and a lot of modern productions could learn a great deal from this performance on how to record a concert well.
The orchestra is a wonderful accompanyment to Glen and the sound is rich and full. Glen's voice is pitch perfect and he does more than admirable performances of all material featured. I particularly like the songs ""Gentle On My Mind"" and "" Galveston"" - the latter ends with a fantastic guitar solo that has had me playing that song endlessly and everytime it gives me goosebumps !!
Buy it and enjoy it - I could still buy it in New Zealand new from a local store ($25 NZ), it is disappointing to see it has been discontinued by the manufacturer and not easily obtainable in the USA.",1261958400,,1236,4.572072072072072

1674814,5,B00005Y6Z7,Bought this Christmas of 2008-very enjoyable music DVD good enough for the whole family takes a nostalgic trip in time with GC and his music. What an artist/entertainer he is. Very happy with the sound recording and the camera angles and high quality. You will not be disappointed- (as if I have to tell you) the man knows how to play the guitar and makes the most of it.,1238630400,,371,4.391304347826087
1674815,5,B00005Y6Z7,"WOW! This man is so talented! I saw this concert on PBS a few months ago. I knew I had to own it. I ordered this and bought some other Glen Campbell CDs. To see Glen perform with the Sioux Falls Symphony is a real treat. Glen is a superb musician, singer, and all around entertainer. He's got to be one of the best guitarists out there. If you watch this, make sure you check out the extra features. There are additional songs and a behind the scenes look at the concert. My husband and I have watched this concert over and over and throughly enjoyed it. This is the next best thing to actually seeing Glen live in concert.",1236211200,2,623,4.2
1674816,5,B00005Y6Z7,"I throroughly enjoyed this DVD! The camera work was top notch and the orchestra backing Glen was superb. He's singing the songs we've heard numerous times in the past, but to watch him as he continues to amaze us with the guitar licks that sends his fingers flying, especially at this age, is wonderful. He's come out of some bad mistakes in his life and is still entertaining at the top of his game.",1232928000,,400,4.418918918918919
1674817,5,B00005Y6Z7,"This was a great concert. We played the DVD on a cross country trip. My kids ages 14-18, my wife and I, and my mother in law ALL loved this video. Great shots, great audio, great songs. I'm so glad we bought this DVD!",1231632000,,217,3.9545454545454546
1674818,4,B00005Y6Z7,"I admit I just rented this DVD for the heck of it.  Of course I had watched Glen on TV back in the day, and marveled at his stage presence and his great vocals, but especially at his smooth and effortless guitar playing.  How can anyone play so well and make it look so easy?

Well, my family laughed at the idea of a GC DVD, until the first song started.  Then they were hooked.

I am amazed that Glen can still sing and play as well as he does.  It's not easy to look and sound great when you are over 60.  He must still work at it really hard, and starting out with a very, very deep well of talent doesn't hurt.  He should be an inspiration to us.

Thanks for that great DVD Glen.  Yes the orchestra behind him was quite good and very effective.

My personal glimpse of Glen:  way back about 1980 I was at a commuter airline gate at Dallas when Glen walked up with Tanya Tucker in tow.  He was going to Texarkana to see family.  Tanya was a cute little thing but very snitty.  She just couldn't be civil or behave, and I could see that her antics irritated Glen.  I thought, ""well, he won't put up with this very long"".  I guess he didn't.",1216080000,3,1143,4.053811659192825
1674819,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Having been a fan of Glen Campbell's for many years, I naturally bought this DVD.  Believe me when I say that I was not disappointed.  This show that was originally aired by PBS is outstanding.  His renditions of his many hits are right on especially Wichita Lineman, Galveston and Rhinestone Cowboy but I was also impressed by some songs that people may not associate with him.  His performance of "" The 1812 Overture is unbelievable, especially when he puts the guitar on his head and plays a portion of the song that way.  Also, Classical Gas which was written by Mason Williams is done expertly by Glen.  And, the show closes with my personal favorite song by Glen, "" Try a Little Kindness "", which is done extremely well.  The Souix Falls Orchestra playing behind him also adds so much to the experience.  I recommend this heartily to all of you who are Campbell fans and to those who are fans of great guitar playing as well. You will not be disappointed !!",1210377600,,963,4.526011560693641
1674820,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Although Glen has lost a bit of his vocal range over the years, he still remains a musical prodigy.  All his hits are here on the DVD and, I think, even the South Dakota Symphony was impressed by his guitar playing. If I had one day left on earth to live, my last wish would be to have Glen Campbell play me a tune on his guitar.",1210032000,,329,3.91044776119403
1674821,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Since purchasing this DVD I am reliving all my favorits songs by Glen Campbell.  It is a must for all die hard Glen Campbell fans.  I also bought the CD from this concert so I can listen to it in my car.  Glen still looks great considering all the hardships he has gone through.  I have found that I like his new renditions of some of his classics better than the original record.  My favorite is ""Wichita Lineman"".  He does an outstanding job on ""MaCarthur Park"" and I have fallen in love with the song ""Still Within The Sound of my Voice"".  I have played this DVD over and over again and will continue to do so until I wear it out!!!  I hope to see Glen perform live for the first time this coming Sept. in Bowling Green, Kentucky and listen to him sing all his great hits.",1208822400,2,775,4.154362416107382
1674822,5,B00005Y6Z7,"I've been fortunate to have seen Glenn Campbell in person several times ~ and ~ I'll go back every chance I get.

This DVD really captures Mr. Campbell at his best.  Not only is his voice as good, or better, than ever, but he is one of the finest guitar players around.  You will witness this on this DVD.

I loved it so much, that I purchased the CD and play it all the time.

His delightful daughter, Debbie, sings with her Dad in this show and adds her own talent and sparkle.

I agree with a previous reviewer that it would have been nice if Mr. C had included some of his wonderful stories.  He tell some very funny ones about Roger Miller.

If you are a Glenn Campbell fan or not, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.  It is definitely worth having.",1205020800,,749,4.145833333333333

1674824,5,B00005Y6Z7,I am a long time Glen Campbell fan and this concert from 2001 recorded live with the South Dakato Orchrestra is must have for any fan.  He does many of his hit songs and several others in his warm and entertaining style and his voice and guitar playing are fantastic.  The DVD is produced very well with great video and sound.  There are 22 songs all together and some interesting backstage interviews.  You will see Glen's super muscianship and ability to sing and play with a great orchrestra in a live concert setting.  Few recording artist could touch his great performance.,1200873600,,578,4.683168316831683

1674827,5,B00005Y6Z7,"After seeing Glen Campbell live and buying the live Glen Campbell CD playing with the South Dakota Symphony I had to get the DVD.  I was a pre-teen in the 1970's when Glen Campbell was probably the most popular and I remember the songs on this DVD with a great deal of nostalgia.

This live performance with the South Dakota Symphony has all the fan favorites from the ever popular Rhinestone Cowboy, Highway Man, Wichita Lineman, Galveston, Gentle on My Mind, Southern Nights, and others.  Even at nearly 70 now, Campbell puts on a great show.  And all his great hits being played live with the South Dakota Symphony puts an added touch to the performance.

This is a great DVD and a great performance by Campbell.",1181779200,2,715,4.5984251968503935
1674828,5,B00005Y6Z7,"A fantastic tribute to Glen Campbell by himself as he looks and sounds fabulous. Glen Campbell has went through many hard times in his life,His addiction to alcohol is well known,but apparently he has pulled himself back to the right side of the road and this concert certainly attests to that. Classical Gas is a highlight in this concert,well worth the price that it is being offered for. On a personal note many years ago in South Jersey we had a place called the Camden County Music Fair on the same lines of a Westbury or Valley Forge type venue,My family had went to see Glen who was then in his prime,after the show you could not ask for a nicer person and I still have the pictures he took with me. A great Artist,A great performer and remember one of the Beach Boys at one time also. Enjoy the DVD you will not have spent any better money than on this.

1674829,5,B00005Y6Z7,"I recently attended a concert with Glen Campbell and the Austin Symphony Orchestra.  It was fantastic and I wished it was being recorded on DVD.  I discovered that a similar concert with the South Dakota Symphony was available on DVD and I found the two performances to be highly similar and enjoyable.  Now I can relive the experience whenever I want.  All the songs have beautiful arrangements but a few especially stand out due to Glen's guitar mastery, notably the William Tell Overature, Galveston, and Classical Gas.  My personal favorites include his rendition of Let It Be Me with his daughter Debbie and his solo of It's Only Make Believe.  My day isn't complete without watching him play the bagpipes and sing Amazing Grace.  It is hard to imagine a performance that is simultaneously stimulating and relaxing but Glen has pulled it off.",1174435200,5,847,4.881118881118881
1674840,5,B00005Y6Z7,"My God, the man takes his classic backlog and actually improves upon perfection with this release! It's all spectacular (not to mention the great 5.1 sound) but I thought tracks such as 'Wichita' and 'Galveston' could not be improved upon. How wrong was I! There are some interesting anecdotes by Glen throughout . My favourite is his story about the backround to the film and song 'True Grit' and the first time he met 'The DUKE'. He goes on to do an outstanding version of the song 'True Grit'. Glen's Fender Strat soars with new breathtaking solo breaks on classics such as 'Glaveston' and 'Wichita Lineman' and his guitar work generally is mean and fast! His daughter Debbie duets on two occasions and does a great job as does the full band and last but not least by far...THE South Dakota Philharmonic Orchestra. WoW!! Top notch!....Glen, long may you shine!.....",1173398400,3,868,4.793333333333333
1674841,4,B00005Y6Z7,"It's funny, but I hadn't heard or thought of Glen Campbell in years (other than the notorious mug shot after his DUI arrest a couple of years ago) and then one day I heard Galveston on the radio and I remembered how much I liked this guy.

So I decided to purchase this live concert DVD where Glen plays many of his greatest hits while being accompanied by a full orchestra.

You don't realize just how talented this guy is until you actually see him perform.

Firstly, he loses nothing live. I've seen and heard artists / bands live and you quickly realize just how much is ""lost"" once they step outside the studio. Not so with Glen - his voice is great for a guy close to 70 and his guitar playing is something else.

I knew this guy was good - I knew he was an in-demand studio session player in the early days, but I didn't realize just how good a player he was until I saw this DVD. Even when I used to watch his summer replacement series for the Smothers Brothers back in the late 60's (boy, that seems like a 100 years ago and a totally different time), I didn't appreciate how talented a guitar player he was / is.

I know Glen is living in the Phoenix area now and playing alot of golf, but clearly he's still picking up his guitar from time to time and honing his craft.

Of course, all of the big hits are here - Witchita Lineman / Gentle On My Mind / Galveston and so many others. And they sound as good today as they did back in the 60's and 70's.

You can say what you want about this guy, but there's no denying that he is one very, very talented singer / musician and I'm very glad that I decided to buy this DVD.

It's going to get alot of playing.",1173139200,8,1665,4.085889570552148

Glen is an amazing musician and he plays so many instuments and he looks and sounds like he did in the 80's. If you like Glen Campbell you will love this concert. The S.

1674845,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Campbell is at his best in this 22 song set.  The audio and lighting are top-notch and the orchestra is excellent.

Those who think Campbell is simply a hokey ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" AM Radio cheeseball would be in for a treat if they watch this DVD.  Campbell's down-home style and his boyish looks seem to have misled the general public about his fabulous talent.

One look at this DVD will bring an appreciation for Campbell as a guitarist, musician and entertainer.  It is no accident that Keith Urban and other current stars count Campbell among their top influences.

Wichita Lineman, Gentle On My Mind, Galveston, Still Within The Sound Of My Voice, Macarthur Park and Classical Gas stand out on the DVD.",1133395200,2,707,4.801652892561983

1674848,4,B00005Y6Z7,"A fine concert perf by Glen, his back-up band, and a symphony.  The song list is a wide representation of his career of hit records and soulful songs

Only detractors are Glen's penchant to go cornball and tell lame jokes as if we were along for the ride on a Branson, Missouri show.  He also blows bagpipes at one point in the proceedings, and, quite frankly, I'm more interested in seeing him play guitar than a mutant vacuum cleaner disguised as a musical instrument. Credit must go to the producers for a first-class production effort and reigning in Glen's cornpone and penchant for getting off track for why we came to the party: music!

Audio quality is very good, and the video director and his tech team execute their jobs well.

Glen's daughter makes an appearance, joining him on ""Little Green Apples.""  The behind the scenes segment is excellent and viewers learn that Glen was a superlative studio musician in Los Angeles in the 60s, and performed on many pop hit classics by Sinatra, The Beach Boys,  Phil Spector and many others.

As for me, I'd love to see Glen put out a video that was along the lines of Frank Zappa's ""Shut Up n Play Yer Guitar"" records.",1114387200,4,1172,4.574162679425838

Wonderful sounds, great stage, brilliant orchestra and the mighty fine and ever so slightly aged (but haven't we all?) Mr Campbell. I watched this concert twice in a row. Went back to hear ""Classical Rock"" again and then started the show again. The bagpipes were great and the songs were all memorable.
Highly recommended, don't delay.",1077062400,15,519,4.591397849462366
1674861,5,B00005Y6Z7,"An American icon of pop-country music is joined by a full symphony orchestra.  Yes, Glen is a bit older (as is this reviewer). His homespun touch is as nice as ever however, and is a wonderful gift to those who remember his music from its first time around.
It's amazing how well this music stands the test of time. It takes us back to a period when radios sang with simple warmth and poetry....and also kindness.
Yes, Glen does a great job. He not only sings and plays well, but also takes us back to when music and people were friendy. It was an era when songs just made us feel good.  Thanks, Glen, for this concert, and for being such a special part of Americana. I never tire of watching this wonderful program!",1074902400,2,716,4.335820895522388

Dressed to kill, full orchestra, great backup musicians, all his hits, very entertaining. His daughter Debbie sings with him too. She always wanted to sing with her Dad and does here. Very touching. And Hey! She's not bad either.  He talks to the crowd, tells stories, he's energetic, excellent sound. Crank up your stereo and enjoy this concert. If he ever plays live in Toronto, I'll be there.",1069113600,,489,4.373626373626373

1674864,3,B00005Y6Z7,"Glen Campbell has to be one of music's greatest crossover artists and this DVD is a great showcase of the many aspects of his prodigeous talent. From his brilliant guitar playing on such classics as ""Galveston"" and the very well done ""Classical Gas"" to his smooth delivery of great songs like ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""Rhinestone Cowboy"". Campbell is an entertainer all the way.
It must be noted that Campbell's voice is no longer what it used to be. It has taken on a much greater nasal sound and he no longer hits the high notes or makes the crescendos but nonetheless his performance is very good considering his age. What he lacks in youthful delivery he makes up for with some great interpreting. A fantastic rendition of Linda Ronstadt's ""Still Within the Sound of My Voice"" and one of the best versions ever of ""MacArthur Park"" along with a lovely cover of ""Time in a Bottle"". These great songs along with many of his classics makes for enjoyable viewing.",1054512000,7,959,4.680473372781065

This is a must-have for any true Glen Campbell fan and even if you weren't a big fan before viewing this....you'll love it!...Glen's performance is TERRIFIC!...  ALL of his great hits are on here and Glen is in great form not to mention his amazing guitar playing skills.  During one song, ""The William Tell Overture"", he actually plays the guitar on his head.  From the moment I put this DVD into my player, I have been unable to stop playing it.  The song selections are wonderful and Glen gives an enthusiastic performance on every song which he sings with such heartfelt emotion.  The resolution is exceptional along with the 5.1 dolby digital surround sound.  He is backed by the brilliantly wonderful South Dakota Orchestra and this is such a pleasure to listen to.  Glen Campbell is like vintage wine.....he just gets better with age.  An added bonus track is ""Mac Arthur Park"".  I don't think I have ever heard this song sung more beautifully.  Get this DVD.....you won't be disappointed  :)  It leaves you wanting more from this GREAT entertainer.",1034467200,42,1082,4.820652173913044
1674867,5,B00005Y6Z7,"I received this dvd as a gift, and am writing this review as a fan who is always looking for opportunities to expose the uninitiated to great music, and a performer who excels in every respect. Glens incredible talent kept him in demand as a session musician for everyone from Sinatra to the Beach Boys. His own records are some the best ever recorded.
  Glen's ability to parlay country balladry with pop sensibility is unrivaled, and this live performance allows him to shine and show why so many people revere him. The excellent South Dakota Symphony join Campbell and play  the gorgeous string and horn arrangements integral to his music....what an orchestra! The camera work and resolution are exceptional.
 This concert resonates, illuminates, and leaves you wanting more. A stunning, entertaining, soothing and unforgettable evening awaits you. Buy it today...overnight it to your door..its worth every penny!  In 2017 this DVD is beyond the price point of what most people are willing to spend on a dvd. I hope the price will come down so even more people can enjoy it.  It's a damn good concert and the ideal way to remember Glen...a true friend of music lovers!",1028073600,22,1171,4.888888888888889

7956462,3,B00005Y6Z7,I had not seen this until it was released on dvd.  Glen  Campbell had not had a hit in awhile.  But he still put on a great live show.  He did his hits like Wichita Lineman abd Rhinestone Cowboy and Southern Nights and Galveston with a blistering lead guitar solo.  Instrumentals like The William Tell Overture and Classical Gas.  And played the bagpipes on his closing song Amazing Grace.  In my opinion there ar entertainers.  Then there is Glen Campbell.,1503273600,,457,4.625

7956468,5,B00005Y6Z7,"Glen Campbell is one of the most talented singers and guitar players in the world.  His performance is captivating and I have watched the DVD over and over.  Even in his 60s, his voice is smooth, with perfect pitch and his interpretation of pop-country classics is flawless. His interpretation of Jimmy Webb songs is unprecedented. His rendition of MacArthur Park, By the Time I Get to Phoenix, It's Only Make Believe, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Still Within the Sound of My Voice, Rhinestone Cowboy, etc. are fantastic.  My only complaint is the Taiwan captions on the DVD that I found to be distracting.  Glen Campbell is charming, relaxed, and puts so much emotion in each song he sings.  I liked the duets he sang with his daughter, Debby Campbell.  Highly recommended, a must have and worthy of repeated viewings.",1449014400,3,821,4.787234042553192
