8278587,4,6305970874,"Good stuff. First of all, you need to be somewhat on the level with what the people in this documentary are talking about. You do not have to be a thug, but if you cannot relate to struggle then you will not feel this movie at all. The shots are bad and the little skit is horrible, but it adds to the grit of the movie I think. Monster is a real G and if you know about the 70-80's then you will feel what he is talking about. Just get it.",1332374400,3,440,3.7934782608695654
8278588,3,6305970874,"I would say it's definitely worth checking out if you read Kody Scott's autobiography ""Monster"". And because I read his book not once, but twice, I was completely sold on viewing this documentary. Especially with Kody making it entertaining getting blazed up and then calling out ""Ice Cube"". Kody even freestyles at the end.",1139184000,3,324,5.018518518518518
8278589,2,6305970874,"The only reason I rented this DVD was to actually see Monster Kody who's book, ""Monster,"" I have just finished reading and loved. And that being said, is the only reason why I would suggest anyone watching this homemade documentary focused on both the major gangs in the LA area.
While I must say I was slightly entertained with the interview in the start of this film, it became hard to watch with every passing minute as each gang member kept saying the the same old thing.. talking about how they started (which is simular in all the members) and telling the kids to educate themselves and get off the street.
If you did read ""Monster,"" then I would say watch it, or at least as much as you can, to see Monster Scott Kody.  I will not get into the interviews with him, but I was surprised as to the life he is currently living and his change after his release.
All in all, there are some intersting aspects of gang life shown and some recreations of some of their lives.  I would not buy this movie due to the fact that I would proboably never watch it more than once, but can recommend as a rental for those who read ""Monster.""",976665600,9,1131,4.305164319248826
