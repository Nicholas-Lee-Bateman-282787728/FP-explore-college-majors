8233737,5,B0001US8AS,Good film for low budget.  I found it funny and I enjoyed Eddie Mcgees performance.,1497484800,,83,4.533333333333333
8233738,5,B0001US8AS,"Low budget dark comedy, beautiful concept - these folks did this all themselves and I loved it. They had no room in the budget for mistakes. The story line is unique and inovative so you know it didn't come out of Hollywood. I love it!",1198281600,,235,4.2444444444444445
8233739,4,B0001US8AS,"2 friends run a flower shop that sells dead roses that you can send to your enemies with a nasty note and/or crushed chocolats. The premise is indeed original and Brian O'Halloran (Dante in Clerks) is excelent, and so is Eddie McGee, playing his best friend who runs the shop with him. The story runs pretty smoothly dispite a few useless early sceens and rather shallow supporting characters that don't add much to the plot and rather slow it down a few minutes. Otherwise once the story gets going it's very cleaver and well played. It won the best Dark Comedy award at the New York Independant film festival, and also won best actor for Brian O'Halloran and best supporting actor for Eddie McGee.",1185148800,,699,4.645161290322581
8233740,5,B0001US8AS,"I saw this movie at a film festival and Brian O'Halloran (who played Dante in Clerks) introduced it. He is really a funny guy, both onscreen and off. This movie has him in another bizarre, dark and yet funny role, and he was lots of fun to watch. The real surpise of the movie was past ""Big Brother"" winner Eddie McGee, who can actually act (!) and was hilariously funny as the slightly unusual sidekick. I love that the fact that he has only one leg was hardly mentioned because it just wasn't important to the role. I would recommend this movie, especially to Kevin Smith movie fans.",1083283200,4,585,4.425925925925926
