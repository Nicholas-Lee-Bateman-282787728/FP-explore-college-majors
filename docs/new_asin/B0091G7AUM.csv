5241746,1,B0091G7AUM,"The good: This movie is free on Netflix. And, if you're wondering whatever became of Marcia Brady, good news-- she's in this movie!

The bad: Every minute you spend watching this movie is a minute of your life you will never get back. There is no puppy in this movie. There's an older, mangy-looking mutt of a puppy that they show twice, sleeping on a pillow, who apparently ""talks"" in the beginning and end of the movie (even the dog was a terrible actor-- it never even looked at the camera). There is no plot in this movie, and what little plot is there doesn't make sense. The unfortunate thing about this movie is that my five-year-old daughter loves it for some inexplicable reason (maybe because it's easy to understand, as there is no plot?) and so now I've seen it about ten times. And it almost gets worse every time. Do not pay money for this movie.",1382745600,11,860,4.443037974683544
5241747,1,B0091G7AUM,Awful! In addition to horrible acting and minimal plot - there is no puppy!!! Seriously the worst movie I have ever seen! Don't waste your time with this one - yuck.,1381017600,3,165,4.354838709677419
5241748,1,B0091G7AUM,"So slow-moving that our six-year-old asked to turn it off after about 20 minutes. At that point, no puppy had appeared, and from reading others' reviews, I now know we'd have been waiting in vain. Glad we gave up on it when we did.

This movie was so awful it's become our standard against which other bad kids' movies are judged. As in, ""Wow, this is almost as bad as The Christmas Puppy!""",1372809600,2,390,4.342465753424658

Okay, this movie, A Christmas Puppy, despite the cover, is NOT about a puppy (I'll explain more later in this review and why it angered me). However, it's about a teenage boy who discovers his Christmas spirit through helping a family reconnect.

A personified Christmas spirit, Hope, suddenly appears and assigns Riley, the teen, to share the spirit with someone else not having a good Christmas. His mother works all of the time and he's used to not spending any time with her. The spirit gives him an address and pre-written fortune cookies. The result is him trespassing into the same mansion seen in A Talking Cat?! So first off, the sets HARDLY CHANGE FOR THESE MOVIES. The only difference is it's raining here.

Weirdly, everyone seems okay with this. Now, here's what Riley faces from the family:

- the mother is trying to write children's books. writer's block has got the best of her
- the father has to close down his company, and is a workaholic. His daughter resents this.
- the daughter wants to see her grandmother, but the family can't because of:
- financial troubles. the mansion is under foreclosure, and their grief
- the daughter also likes the neighbor boy and has been meaning to give him a present

So one by one, a stranger in a random family's home talks and encourages them to cherish what they have and shares some of his own experiences. The spirit comes up once in a while to assist Riley in advice.

The conflict part of the movie comes in after the daughter tries to coerce Riley into stealing her dad's credit card to buy her grandmother a ticket to come to the house. Riley, good thing, has morals, so he does not do this. Instead he calls her grandmother (at the urging of the spirit) in her dad's office and explains everything, mentioning the spirit and everything. She seems okay with this and actually believes him....
The coming scene, the family noticed some of their things are missing. The daughter thinks Riley has something to do with it since she made him try to steal his credit card, and Riley admits to calling the grandmother. They ask him to leave. It's discovered that the puppy, the non existent character in this film, took them.

I have to say the grandmother was the best character. She was pretty much the device that brought resolution to the plot.

(sigh) Okay, I'm done mentioning anything else in the movie.

Though the movie wasn't really best, it was heartwarming (not Oscar-esque heartwarming, but an condescending ""aw"", then you quickly move on with your life). It wasn't 'bad movie entertaining', but it was tolerable. It was very tongue-in-cheek instead of cheesy as some would expect from a movie like this. Hope and Riley moreso from that aforementioned vibe. I wouldn't really recommend this movie. It's actually kind of bland, like wet, flavorless spaghetti.

but wait....

Are you ready for what angered me? There is somewhat of a minor twist (or what I call a ""WTF!"" moment). Remember how I said this movie isn't about a puppy at all? Well, that's half true (or maybe 1/4 true? A fifth? Ah, I don't know...). Throughout the movie, there is a puppy (which ironically isn't the same one displayed on the cover), but is not a major character at all. Basically, at the end of the movie, this puppy finally ""talks"" and is supposedly responsible for helping Riley bring the spirit of Christmas to the family. So pretty much,the eponymous character IS in the movie, but does NOT play a major role but somewhat does and did the entire time, if that makes any sense. This is pretty lazy writing. At least An Easter Bunny Puppy admitted their ""deceit"" (another movie that showed a lazy way to write by ""giving the audience telepathy"").

Ugh, I had higher (note HIGHER) hopes for this release.",1364515200,3,3791,4.718608169440242
5241750,1,B0091G7AUM,"Our family was looking for a nice Christmas movie on Netflix when we came across this one, which was rated 5 stars. Apparently by masochists. Because this is by far the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. And as others here have mentioned, THERE IS NO PUPPY!

Maybe ""puppy"" is a euphemism for something else here, but it's never quite made clear.",1357344000,5,348,4.612903225806452
5241751,1,B0091G7AUM,"There is NO PUPPY whatsoever in this movie. There is a nasty/ugly little mutt that has little to nothing to do with the movie. To sum up this movie you get a HORRIBLE plot, acting, and lack of a puppy. I wish I would take the last 90 minutes of my life back (not to mention my poor children's wasted evening!).",1356652800,9,310,4.098360655737705
5241752,1,B0091G7AUM,"No puppy is EVER present in the movie, I even waited till the very end. It's really about a teenage kid who helps another family at Christmas, with maybe two screen shots of a gruff looking older dog for 10 seconds each. The advertising people really know how to bring in the crowd by just slapping a picture of a puppy on the front. TOTAL scam :P Next time I'll read reviews before watching and wasting my time. At least I learned a lesson.",1356134400,8,441,4.261904761904762

8534137,1,B0091G7AUM,"Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. But what made me write this is that it is completely DECEPTIVE as well. The puppy on the cover is NOT in this movie. There is one old Maltese seen for about 10 seconds at the end of this dreadful excuse for a movie that has nothing to do with dogs whatsoever. It has to do with bad actors in a bad script about bad characters in a tacky house.

The people who have given this movie five stars are doing so as a sarcastic joke. Amazon shouldn't even sell this SCAM product!",1447286400,,529,4.038095238095238

8534140,5,B0091G7AUM,"WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS:
I am not an emotional man. No, I am the kind of guy who keeps all those feelings buried deep, deep, deep below a layer of six pack abs, gigantic biceps, a buzz cut, and some sick tats I got on my chest back in the day when I was growing up in Brazil. I have one tattoo, in particular, right over my heart. This particular tattoo reads ""Dead Inside"". However after seeing a ""Christmas Puppy"", I have no choice but to get that tattoo lasered off, as  ""A Christmas Puppy"" has filled me with a joy and wonder that I haven't felt since I was a small child celebrating Christmas with my family in the Philippines!  The magic of this movie is electric, and you just can't help but find yourself smiling as Riley tumbles into the lives of a family desperately in need of Christmas Joy. You find yourself smiling one minute, and then the next you find yourself breaking out into hysterical laughter as Riley cooks a meal that is too spicy, and chaos ensues! What a goofball! This movie had me laughing hysterically throughout many of its scenes! This cinematic masterpiece is not without its sad parts however. For example, when the family finds out that Grandma is not going to be able to make it for Christmas, the characters are devastated. I couldn't help but cry as I remembered my own childhood growing up in rural Switzerland. When I was 11 years old, I remember the devastation I felt when I heard that my grandmother would not be able to make it to Christmas dinner, and ""A Christmas Puppy"" recreates this devastation in a way that is all to real. All hope is not lost though, and with the help of some Christmas cheer, the Grandmother is able to make it to Christmas dinner after all! Now, I have heard many people complain in these reviews that their is no golden retriever puppy. I would beg to differ. As a small boy living in Botswana, I remember asking my parents for a puppy for Christmas one year. I was devastated when I did not receive said puppy for Christmas. However, when I grew up, I realized that I was way too immature at that time to have taken care of a puppy. Christmas puppy helps prepare kids for this inevitable truth of life. They go in to this movie, expecting to see a golden retriever puppy, but instead they gain something more valuable. A sense of responsibility and Christmas Joy. If your child asks for a puppy for Christmas, I insist that you make them watch this movie first. When they expect to see a puppy in this movie but instead receive a life lesson in love, friendship, responsibility, and Christmas Joy, it will help prepare them for actual Christmas Day when you explain to your kids that ""they just aren't ready for a dog yet"" and that a ""Nintendo 64 is a much better gift anyway."" The golden retriever puppy in this movie is not simply an actual puppy. It is a metaphor for the golden retriever puppy found inside of all of us.  A golden retriever puppy that represents youthful Christmas spirit, and  a playful sense of Christmas Joy! To end this review, I implore you to go out and watch this movie. It is truly a life changing experience, and will change the lives of your children and you. As a child growing up on the steppes of Mongolia, I wish that I had had a chance to view this movie with my parents, as I believe that it may have changed my life for the better. 5 Stars all the way!",1413072000,10,3365,4.396468699839486
