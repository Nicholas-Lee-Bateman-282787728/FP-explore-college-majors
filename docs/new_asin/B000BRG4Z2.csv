8091458,5,B000BRG4Z2,"This movie came recommended to me when I was up in Canada.  It's won various awards (best direction, screenplay, acting) so I gave it a go and I'm glad I did.  It is a dark comedy, with excellent acting, especially by Paul Campbell.  The supporting cast of small town characters is over the top, but in a delightful, quirky way.  The film got me to think about how everyone struggles towards doing something different, to break out of a rut, to move on to something better, but the forces holding one in place can be substantial.  It's a thoughtful film, moving and well-done, funny and quirky.  If you like darkish comedy, give it a go.",1511136000,,637,4.495652173913044
8091459,4,B000BRG4Z2,"Other than the foul language, this could have been a good independent film with lots of interesting twists and subplots that all fit together.  [If you took the 'F-word' out of this movie, I guess there'd be 10-15% less dialogue, unfortunately.]  At its essence, it is a lesson about how one's lies and promiscuous sex can come back to hurt not only oneself, but many others as well.  It is certainly a professionally done movie.  Some of the characters are comic, others downright dangerous, and everything in between.  If you can stomach the relentless use of the 'F-word,' I would think that most people would find this to be a complicated but interesting story.",1154304000,2,665,4.798245614035087

this movie has a ton of twists and turns and will keep you laughing & disturbed at the same time!  highly recomended for people who like older coen brothers material ie; FARGO and are fans of dark comedy!!  RENT THIS!!!!",1139097600,2,909,4.357142857142857
