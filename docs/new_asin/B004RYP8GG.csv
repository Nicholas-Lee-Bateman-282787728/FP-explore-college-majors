8439410,5,B004RYP8GG,"I love this movie!  I show it to my classes every year before we do persuasive writing because it shows so many ways to peacefully persuade:  picketing, letter writing, television interviews, and boycotting - in this case, boycotting baths.  Martin Luther King and his work are also mentioned, and then the kids in the movie adapt what they've learned to helping out in a real-life situation.

I bought this movie because the copy I've used for year's was a VCR copy, and I needed a DVD.

I think this movie shows kids how to stand up for what they believe in and do the right thing!",1369699200,,583,4.462264150943396
