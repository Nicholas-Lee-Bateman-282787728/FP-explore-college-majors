2398829,4,B000AYYVGA,"Good clean fun. Some funny stuff, some silly. It's just ok, but compared to his worldly counterpart, he's outstanding.",1227398400,2,118,5.2631578947368425
2398830,2,B000AYYVGA,"Maybe my expectations were set too high, but ""Tolerate This"" frankly wasn't all that funny.  Not that the material didn't hold some humor in it, but I rarely found myself having much of a laugh at any time during the show.",1216598400,,222,4.414634146341464
2398831,4,B000AYYVGA,"This is a great routine.  Brad Stine combines comedy with some good food for thought.  It would be hard not to laugh a lot listening to this routine.

Like all good comedians, Stine can take virtually any routine situation and turn it into a joke. The main difference is that he is able to get laughs without foul language, which is such a rarity these days. He is also very open about being Christian and conservative.

He has very funny routines on various topics including the following:  applause, common courtesy, men and women, spiders, Jesus' brother, and many more.  I have all of Stine's CDs and would recommend this one as well as all of the others.  He is also great to see live.

Highly recommended!",1203379200,,711,4.587301587301587
2398832,5,B000AYYVGA,"If you're tired of all the dirty words and sexual innuendos that most of today's comics employ, then you'll love Brad Stine. His is good clean humor! This guy has so much energy I get tired just watching him.",1195171200,,208,4.358974358974359
2398833,4,B000AYYVGA,"Again, Brad Stine is in your face with humor and thought provoking ideas.  Whether you are Christian, Conservative, or neither, you should see this DVD.  You will be better off for it.",1178928000,,184,4.71875
2398834,5,B000AYYVGA,Our family loves Brad Stine!  My kids quote some of his lines when the situation fits and we laugh again!  I am so glad we have a comedian who doesn't use fowl language to try to be funny.  He is also one who stands up for the Judeo-Christian principles with which our great country was founded. With humor he gets one to think about these things and join the army to fight for keeping our freedom and one nation under God.,1172016000,5,423,4.197530864197531
2398835,5,B000AYYVGA,I bought the DVD for my son for Christmass He Throughly enjoyed it and it was entertaining for the whole family GOOD CLEAN FUN.,1169078400,,127,4.333333333333333
2398836,4,B000AYYVGA,"Brad Stine has made a name for himself as a Christian Conservative Comedian.  He fills a niche in a market inundated with those of the oppositie political bent.

This DVD, like the last one, Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed, is a live audience performance.  Brad has a nice rapport with his audience and his sense of timing and his clever selection of a wide array of content makes for a solid show.  There's something for everyone here, and its nice to see a comedy act that my 8 year-old could watch that is familiy-friendly.  I suppose if you are a liberal, you may not like some his politically-oriented comments, but if you enter with an open mind there's plenty of 'oh yeah everyone feels that way' moments.  Also, Brad's act is over an hour long- impressive!  Most comedians put in their 30 mins and you are revving up as an audience just as they suddenly shut down the show- not so with Stine.

I am giving this DVD 4 stars, rather than 5, only because the previous Stine work, Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed, was, well...better.  In the prior outing Brad played to a smaller theater venue and the camera work was better able to display his act.  In Tolerate This! Brad is playing to a huge stadium-style audience and the impact of Brad's jokes is lessened(though still far superior to 90% of the comedy out there).

If you are a Christian Conservative(about 50% of the country mind you) then this DVD is for you.  I would suggest that you first grab Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed because it is a better primer for what Brad is all about.  That being said, the two DVD's compliment each other nicely because Brad obviously took care in not using retread jokes from one show to the next. You can't have too much of a good thing.",1156982400,27,1752,4.54140127388535
2398837,5,B000AYYVGA,"Brad Stine shows that born again Christians can be fuuny to!  He didn't give a sermon, but he worked the Bible into the act very well.  This is a DVD that ALL people will enjoy ... religious or not.  He may step on a few toes with his style, but all around this is a great DVD that even the kids can watch.",1155254400,11,306,3.8253968253968256
2398838,1,B000AYYVGA,"Delivery of 'jokes' is pretty flat. I was waiting for it to get better, and then he started a Christian pity-party agenda rant. Geez. By the way, our country is a REPUBLIC, jerk wad, NOT a ""Democracy"". If he wants to push an agenda, maybe comedy is not the place for him. At the very least, he should research the subject matter before opening his gap.",1507680000,,352,4.348484848484849

2398847,5,B000AYYVGA,"Really love Brad Stine! Good clean comedian that gets you thinking. Don't 100% agree with every point he makes but still think he is worth watching. Also, remember he is a comedian not a teacher/instructor.",1403136000,,206,4.914285714285715

2398850,5,B000AYYVGA,"It's very rare these days to find things that are good for the family. Even shows marked 'family friendly' hardly ever are. This is one of those great ones!! I really like Brad Stine's comedy. It's comedy everyone can enjoy. As a conservative, Mr. Stine has had liberals approach him with compliments of his jokes. The best of all is his facial expressions. Brad is open and not pretentious about life, specifically his own. I highly recommend any dvd by Brad Stine",1340064000,,465,4.682926829268292
2398851,5,B000AYYVGA,"Brad Stine is a one of a kind conservative, patriotic, Christian comedian that is truly hilarious.  I can't believe I haven't heard of him before.

Tolerate this is funnier and less political / sermon like than Unleashed.

If you don't associated yourself as being either conservative, patriotic or Christian, then don't buy this DVD and don't leave you stupid reviews.  If you can associate yourself with one, two or all three of these classifications; then I'm positive you will find some material extremely funny that you can relate too.",1330905600,,540,5.033707865168539
2398852,5,B000AYYVGA,"If you've read any other of my reviews on Brad Stine you'll know I am a fan.  There's nothing like hearing the truth in a funny way and in a way that does NOT include rude or vulgar language.  This is a comedian who you don't have to turn the volume down on when a kid walks in the room.  Though some jokes may go over a kids head, my young (10 yr. old) nephew enjoyed him too.",1325030400,,377,3.8076923076923075
2398853,5,B000AYYVGA,"Absolutely hilarious, a must have for the clean comedy fan. Brad Stine delivers, once again, a great comedy DVD. Buy yours today!",1321056000,,129,4.909090909090909
2398854,3,B000AYYVGA,"I liked a lot of what Brad Stine has to say. I agree with the politics.

But to be fair, it feels like - as the audience - you are being yelled at for the entire act.  His delivery is angry.  It's polished, he's obviously very comfortable, but at times I felt it was almost oppressive listening.

Some of it is actually funny.  But it's not like say, Blue Collar Comedy, where you mostly just laugh your rear end off.

I guess it depends on your cup of tea.  I thought it was going to be more light-hearted than it is.",1302048000,,518,4.069306930693069

2398857,5,B000AYYVGA,"This is the best in Christian comedy.  Brad Stein's delivery, timing and quirky sense of humor remind me of George Carlin.  You will not be disappointed.",1229040000,,153,4.846153846153846
8081097,5,B000AYYVGA,"I think this is the 1st truly conservative comic I've ever seen. Whether conservative or liberal this is a must see.
For conservatives so you know you're not alone & for liberals an opportunity to a peak in to why conservatives feel the way they do.
Hopefully it will allow for a dialogue to start rather than the hate of another's belief.
Not all funny but has a lot of truth based on the creators purpose for us.
Last but not least view it with an open mind not filtered through preconceived beliefs.",1524787200,,502,4.408602150537634
8081098,5,B000AYYVGA,"This guy is like the conservative Christian version of George Carlin. Very clever, witty, and animated. And here it is 2018 as I write this and this special of his came out in 2011 and yet it could never be more poignant than it is today. This guy was saying ""make America great again"" long before it was ever printed on a red hat.",1522108800,,331,4.1875

I think many of us know the answer.  I highly recommend Brad to anyone who 1) Has a moral compass and 2) can laugh at yourself.  If you THINK you're tolerant, then take a look.  Caution: Brad only makes fun, he doesn't degrade.  That may be a bridge too far for the less conservative among us.  Enjoy!",1510012800,,455,4.1022727272727275
8081103,1,B000AYYVGA,"About half way through I was sure this was pure parody. Then I noticed the audience (with the exclusion of a few groups towards the back) slowly stopped laughing. You see... the only time he is funny is when he is not using a straw-man to make his point or leaning on a bible lectern. It's not even comedy most of the time. So to bring back some levity he does some actual comedy for a skit and goes back into his lecture. The cigarette trick was interesting especially when performed by someone who claims to be a non-smoker.

It's a glorified kool aid drinking contest with one participant. The cringe at some points is thicker than the density of his arguments. A living cartoon of how many Americans and the international community view the ever shrinking segment of ""Christian Conservative"" America.",1508198400,,804,4.661971830985915

8081105,1,B000AYYVGA,"He started flinging the typical, untrue, Christian political propaganda within a minute or two of the start. This isn't funny, it's just some guy loudly reinforcing what the indoctrination to which his audience has already been subjected.",1507939200,,238,5.45945945945946
