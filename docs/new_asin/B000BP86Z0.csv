to take a resort vacation to Mexico, where they would
definitely become aware of this Latin Star of the 60's and
70's, Jorge Rivero, they all, without a doubt, would vote
Him in, unanimously, as an addition of an example of
the 'Human Man' in the form of a Greek or Roman god.
This guy cannot be surpassed in the HOTT, Hott hott
category !",1389052800,3,400,4.333333333333333
8090437,3,B000BP86Z0,"Not the movie I remember from the drive-in as a teen, but it is enjoyable and mildly humorous. The reactions of the couple to one another are slightly childlike, which is understandable for adult sized newborns. I understood just enough Spanish to note that what was spoken was following the words from the Bible (I believe).",1380672000,,325,4.821428571428571

I remembered this movie from the 60's MEXICO'S SECOND GOLDEN FILM ERA - WHAT I DID NOT REMEMBER IS HOW FRANK THIS MOVIE IS IN PORTRAYING ADAM & EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN ""JUST AS GOD CREATED THEM"". BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT'S TO BE ASHAMED OF? The biblical story evolves during the time before Adam & Eve had ""SINNED"" - so everything is seen from an innocent point of view. This movie gives solid competition to THE BIBLE. The complete story is narrated. Mr. JORGE RIVERO & Ms. KANDY CAVE act their scenes through emotion and facial expressions, not words. Beautiful cinematography that resembles a true paradise and excellent use of technicolor. Too bad Mexico's movie industry died with the advent of VHS. THEY SURE DON'T MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS ANYMORE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1298419200,4,1087,5.514970059880239
8090439,3,B000BP86Z0,"THE SIN OF ADAM & EVE- a Mexican made production of the Bible story - is very hard to find anywhere - It also can be seen as a companion film to the Spanish produced 1954 ADAM & EVE , which can be found on VHS on Amazon.

 The earlier version is more solemn and slow + mainly produced on sound stages. THE SIN.. was made mainly in outdoor locations and benefits from a greater variety of sets. Eden itself though looking a little too fairy tale like is quite lovely.

  In Spanish without subtitles , it can still be easily followed if one doesnt speak the language.
The two actors do what they can with the limited script . The nudity is handled very discreetly - no real full frontal. Jorge Rivero makes a very handsome well built first man . Candy Cave has an unfortunate wig that distracts and detracts from her acting.",1287532800,4,823,4.283870967741936
8090440,2,B000BP86Z0,"I must say that as a comic movie it is Ok, but very poor in Bible teachings, in fact it has so many errors that has confused things and anyone who is has not a good knowledge of the Word of God will confused.  Of course we are not suppose to go by a movie but by the word, but sometimes people begin to understand things by sight and then as he reads the Bible learns more, but I would not give anybody this as a gift. Too bad that the Actors were good but in this film they messed up.",1277164800,,485,3.801980198019802

Good movie if you are into eye candy, otherwise, try another movie.",1167782400,7,244,4.212765957446808
