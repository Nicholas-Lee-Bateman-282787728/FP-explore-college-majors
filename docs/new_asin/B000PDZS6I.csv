Samantha Brown's review of the Hotel Monaco was very helpful, although some of the perks that she mentions are no longer available to my knowledge.  If they are still available, they are not offered.  I like being able to see a hotel room before staying there and this video was helpful in that regard.",1218844800,2,351,4.5396825396825395
