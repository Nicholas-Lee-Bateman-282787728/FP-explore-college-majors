4172089,2,B003QZO8AY,"Amazing that they can include so many great soul artists on this DVD set, but inexplicably FAIL to include by far the BEST live Soul Train performance ever: AL GREEN's mighty, gospel workout HERE I AM from 73!  This is criminal - esp since an amazing snippet from this exact performance is featured on VH1 Classic's recent SOUL TRAIN: THE HIPPEST TRIP IN AMERICA doc that aired to promote this same DVD box set!  Ironically, you'd probably do better to just DVR the VH1 doc, since it also takes time to feature what really drew fans to the show week after week for decades: THE DANCERS and the DANCE LINE! Cmon, to cut all that priceless footage out misses the entire selling point of the seminal show itself.  Also, if you're just featuring performances, why not feature any artists from the 80s or 90s (I believe PRINCE appeared on the show for the firt time ever in '94 on his ""Gold Experience"" era?) and/or groups actually SPAWNED by Soul Train itself, i.e. no SHALAMAR? no JERMAINE STEWART? Really?! I could go on & on, as I'm a huge Soul Train fan, but, sadly, I won't be buying this.",1284163200,44,1090,4.494949494949495
4172090,1,B003QZO8AY,"I have a huge collection of dvds and I was very excited to get this 3 cd set. I was looking forward to seeing the Soul Train dancers...sadly, they have been cut out of the episodes...except for the Soul Train line (and only a few). This set is mostly bad lip-sync performances. There are a few moments I got excited about...but over all a very big disapointment. VH1 produced Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America...it was 5 stars!...I thought this documentary was part of the 3 dvd set...since they advertised the release of the dvds at the end of the show...plus it is detailed in the product description. But again, sadly, this was not included in the set...too bad. So, I thought that the single dvd for sale had the VH1 documentary on it (since the product description is the same as the 3dvd set)...So, I purchased it. It is the same as disc 1 of the 3 dvd set. What a shame...I guess I'll have to go to You Tube (for free) to see the Soul Train Dancers. If I could rate this for ZERO stars I would.",1284163200,16,1007,4.3052631578947365
4172091,2,B003QZO8AY,"While i would be the first to say anything bad about Soul Train as it was and still is one of the best entertainment shows all around,
I must say that this 3DVD pk was not  put together in a way to show case the artists that was introduced, Don Cornelius would
call a group's name but they were not on the DVD,all that could have been edited out. The interviews from the dancers was too long and
some to far out. We know all stars could not be in the pkg but single DVD of various artist have cost less and was a lot better.",1283904000,3,524,3.943396226415094
4172092,3,B003QZO8AY,Would be nice if somebody compared this to the newer Single and 3 DVD sets i.e. are all the performances on the newer disks already on this 9 DVD Set?,1283212800,8,150,4.033333333333333
4172093,5,B003QZO8AY,"Soooooouuuuuullllll Train! I'm as white as they come, but I loved this show in its heyday. I was 12 when it premiered in 1970. It was a window into a culture as smooth and brash in its musicality and vernacular as it was in its dyn-o-mite dancing and day-glo fashion. Don Cornelius was the serene ruler of this kingdom, speaking in a voice both sonorous and mellifluous, wearing royal silk shirts and maroon velveteen suits, not a hair out of place in his afro crown. I tuned in both to groove to the great songs and to make myself just a bit hipper, and my own record collection, bellbottoms, wide lapels, and platform shoes were evidence of my devotion to the music and the people who produced it.

There is no way this 3-DVD set, with its wide array of stars and 50 great songs spread over five hours, could deserve less than the highest rating, even if the mastering were second rate. But the audio and video reproduction are excellent; Time-Life knows its stuff. And there are more than three hours of extras consisting primarily of lengthy retrospective interviews with such figures as the imperturbable Don Cornelius and the voluble Smokey Robinson.

This wonderful compilation is a priceless sampler of the 1970s and a who's who of classic soul, from the Queen to the Godfather. Among others, you'll find represented Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5, The Isley Brothers, The O'Jays, The Commodores, Sly Stone, Barry White, Bill Withers, Gladys Knight, Lou Rawls, Teddy Pendergrass, Curtis Mayfield and, ladies and gentlemen, the hardest working man in show business, Jaaaaaaaaaaaames Brown! ""The Best of Soul Train"" needs a star in its rating for every star on the DVDs!

4172094,3,B003QZO8AY,"This is a good collection but i would have liked it better if it had less popular artists and more people like Johnny Nash who sings ""I can see clearly now"" for example. And it's true that there are too many Affro Sheen commercials but at least you can skip them with your DVD remote. I found that i liked the 6th DVD better than the rest. This collection didn't blow my mind but it's quite enjoyable nonetheless.",1280275200,31,413,4.3076923076923075
4172095,1,B003QZO8AY,"First of all, The Best of Soul Train - 9 DVD Collector's Set are not FULL EPISODES!!!  When my sister and I watched the first DVD we were shocked!!  The so called episodes was only 15 maybe 20 minutes.  Not the full episode (45 min) we were expecting.  Also, they showed so many commercials (the same ones) over and over, we got sick of them.  When you first see the  Afro Sheen commercial you go on a trip down memory lane.  You're all smiles.  But once you've seen the commercials (maybe 10 different ones all together)  You see them after every act and soon tire of them.  People who purchase this should know that the best of soul train (in this time life set) means, the best of soul train performances.  Hey, that's not a problem, but the most disappointing thing of all was they did not show all of the soul train lines.  We expected to see a soul train line per show.  This was not the case.  Every four shows you may see one soul train line.  THAT IS NOT ENOUGH.  I love Don and all of the dancers but not this collection!  Sometimes at the beginning they would announce who would be on the show and only one of the groups announced would actually be on the episode.  NOT ONE FULL SOUL TRAIN EPISODE OF SOUL TRAIN WAS IN THIS ENTIRE COLLECTION.  SO BUYER BEWARE!!  It's still nice to see the performances, but for me it wasn't worth the 150.00 bucks I paid.  On a good note, it was fun watching Don and Marvin Gaye play basket ball.  Don't get me wrong the collection had its moments, but not having full episodes including soul train lines was just to disappointing to me.

No Shalamar perforances!  No Jodi Wotley performance!  No Locketts!!!

Know that this collection focus is on the performances and the performances ONLY.  Hopefully they will come out with FULL EPISODES of Soul Train and I will be there to purchase it.  I wanted so much more than this collection had to offer!!!  But this collection did not deliver.",1274227200,229,1933,4.396600566572238

I understand why you would include legends like Marvin Gaye but no one wants to see him lip sync badly. Curtis Mayfield too.  At least, James Brown's performances saved the set but don't get too excited about seeing Stevie Wonder on there.  They chose to include some 90s performance of Stevie doing some impromptu medley of a few of his songs with some of the female dancers standing behind him as if everyone was huddled around the piano singing Christmas carols.

4172112,2,B003QZO8AY,"I mistakenly thought this set included the VH1 documentary, The Hippest Trip in America.  I figured as long as it at least  has that, anything else is bonus.

I guess the best way to describe this is: imagine going home for Thanksgiving dinner and all they've got prepared is green beans, cranberry sauce and rolls.  It's not terrible; it's just terribly incomplete.

There are some great clips here and there.  The ones with Aretha are amazing, but the rest is so bland.  I mean, I watched this show RELIGIOUSLY each Saturday.  I KNOW what was on there.  This collection has just about removed the heart and SOUL.

Do yourself a favor...next time VH1 shows ""The Hippest Trip..."" save it to your DVR and never record over it or tape it on your vcr and burn it to dvd.  THAT doc has REAL soul.

Don is turning over in his grave.",1388102400,2,827,4.44
4172113,3,B003QZO8AY,"I must not have picked the one that had the artists that thrilled me. Isley Brothers and Barry White just OK. I liked them both but they were not as entertaining as some of the other groups in that era, on stage.",1371945600,,212,4.071428571428571
4172114,4,B003QZO8AY,I just wish I realized which performances were on here; I thought there was going to be something else but in general it's fun to watch the commercials and the interviews and of course the dancers,1359417600,,196,4.472222222222222
4172115,2,B003QZO8AY,"I received this as a Christmas present and being an expert of making mixed tapes, this DVD was atrocious! Here's how it should have been done in my opinion. The Soul Train opening credits, then Don Cornelius introducing the acts back to back or have the artist name flash across the screen before they stated singing. The interviews, questions from the dancers, Afros Sheen commercials, the scramble board and Soul Train line should have been part of the Special Features part of each DVD. I think that would have kept it more interesting since it's a ""THE BEST OF"" DVD. Putting a full episode on a ""BEST OF DVD"" makes NO sense! Some of my other complaints with this DVD is that I didn't need to see the opening an closing credits for each episode, Love Unlimited singing Love's Themes wasn't a hit, the instrumental was. Each artist should appeared only once and it should have been their best performance. The Commodores segment were boring as HELL! They Should have sang Brickhouse and that's it! AND finally I would have like to seen: The Supremes post Diana Ross, hell Diana Ross, The Temptations, Four Tops, Stylistics, Blue Magic, Spinners, Betty Wright, Denise LaSalle, Al Green for god sakes wasn't on here! The Sylvers, Millie Jackson, Joe Simon, Jerry Butler & Brenda Lee Eager, Ronnie Dyson and Tyrone Davis just off the top of my head. Then Don ends the DVD with his love, peace and soul and we watch the dancers get down. Then we go wash up then put the second DVD in! In other words in should have been more exact and concise like the Ed Sullivan Motown performance DVD.",1357603200,5,1585,4.624113475177305
4172121,3,B003QZO8AY,"In a nutshell, this is anything but ""the best"" of Soul Train.
Sure, lot's of great performances, but so many superior performances left out and replaced with mediocre, relatively obscure performances.
Repetitive Afro-sheen commericals, very few Soul Train line dances, and conspicuously left out legendary performances from The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Sylvers, Aretha, Gladys Knight, The Ojays, Al Green, Supremes, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Stevie, etc, etc . Perhaps 20% of what it could/should have been. Please, please somebody release ALL Soul train episodes in their entirety.",1342310400,,588,5.617977528089888
4172122,4,B003QZO8AY,"Despite what some reviews say, this collection is highly enjoyable.  There are Soul Train dance lines, commercials from back in the day, and a lot of great performances from some of the greatest soul singers. See the jackson 5 with Randy after their peak years perform I Want You Back, and songs from Lookin' Through The Windows, plus a solo performance from Jermaine. Many performances are lip synced, but some seem to be live performances such as Barry White and Sly & the Family Stone. It might have been better if it did not include the opening every time a new episode starts or if it was in chronological order.  It's great to see the dancers and the performers, including James Brown.",1342310400,,691,4.655737704918033

4172124,1,B003QZO8AY,"I had been eyeing this product for quite awhile after I saw the VH1 documentary. My expectations came crashing to the ground before I got halfway through the first DVD. To begin with, the roster of artists that were supposed to be featured was thin compared to the packaging hype. The selection of clips appeared to be a random mish-mash. None of the clips featured captured the artists' best appearances on the show; notable exceptions - James Brown & Barry White. One unexpected surprise was the clip featuring L.T.D. (featuring Jeffrey Osborne) singing their first hit ""Love Ballad"". The biggest disappointment was the segment featuring the Jackson 5. As an avid viewer of the show since it's inception up until Don Cornelius stepped down as host, I know the Jacksons made several appearances on the show and I know there were better episodes of them that could have been featured. From what I read on the inserted booklet notes, it appears Don Cornelius had very little (if anything to do) to do with the selection of episodes. One would think out of a 30-year series run, the archived choices would have been immense. But it appears that almost all of the show appearances came from a time period of 1972 thru 1980; and certainly not the best of the lot either. Then I had to suffer through some of those really lame commericals. As a (young) black person, I used those products as much as anybody, but the most of the commercial clips featured in the package only ticked me off even further. To add insult to injury, in one of the ""Soul Train Scramble Board"" episodes that was featured ... the (idiot) ""contestants"" misspelled the word ""ingredient"" while trying to identify the group ""The Main Ingredient""!! This whole package was a comedy of errors!! I bought it because of Don Cornelius' recent death and wanted a keepsake of his iconic show. Most of the performers who appeared during the show's run had either began or peaked in their careers long before music video era of the 80's and 90's. The only visual record of their careers was primarily their appearances on Soul Train. This package is a pi$$-poor representation of the talent that came through or got started on the show!! The only reason I'm not returning it for a refund is that the clothes worn by Don Cornelius and the dancers in their various appearances ... some of them are worth a real belly laugh!! But I didn't buy this package for comic relief and I'm sorely disappointed! I've seen better on Youtube and Centric!!",1332115200,7,2496,4.71395881006865

4172127,5,B003QZO8AY,"THE BEST OF SOUL TRAIN: Billed as ""the hippest trip in America"", SOUL TRAIN was urban society's answer to AMERICAN BANDSTAND, a wall-to-wall assault of the funkiest fashions, fiercest 'fros, and fanciest dance moves ever busted out on the boob-tube. The weekly groove-a-thon (sponsered by ULTRA SHEEN and AFRO SHEEN products) was presided over by the king-daddy of suave sophistication and unadulterated cool, creator/host/entrepreneur DON CORNELIUS, whose dulcet tones welcomed seemingly every 70s RNB chart mover from EARTH, WIND & FIRE and JAMES BROWN to THE ISLEY BROTHERS and ARETHA FRANKLIN, with token white icons such as ELTON JOHN and DAVID BOWIE occasionally joining the party. Regular features included the SOUL TRAIN SCRAMBLE BOARD, a word jumble of black icons, and a loose-limbed line dance showcasing the acrobatic, aerodynamic SOUL TRAIN dancers demonstrating steps like THE ROBOT, THE SLIDE, and THE FUNKY CHICKEN...future celebrities ROSIE PEREZ and FRED ""RERUN"" BERRY sprang from their ranks. The longest running syndicated series ever, SOUL TRAIN was a euphoric, kalaidoscopic ride no self-respecting music lover could afford to miss.

Johnson and Johnson haircare products and other outlets where it got reached.  its hard to iamgine a time when seeing a Black Performer on tv was a rare thing, but there was a time not that long ago and thankfully Don Cornelious filled that void with all the Great talents over the years that gave it there all on stage.  the dancers were always  incredible as was the fashion.  Props to Sid Mccoy and all the folks behind the scenes.  Soul train the Hippest place to be.  Don Cornelious was part of the Civil Rights Movement and lead a wave to include Black People and sadly he passes on the first day of Black  History Month.  He was as  Cool as Johnny Carson if you will and his introductions, interviews and interactions with guests paved the way for what you see on 106 Park, TRL Live on MTV and other Music based shows.  yeah  American bandstand was checking out  Soul Train.  great to hear and see alot of great performances on here.  put it like this  Don Cornelious is one of the Mount Rushmore's of Modern R&B Music. he left a huge mark and I haven't been this sad  since Michael Jackson passed.

4172130,1,B003QZO8AY,"I was disappointed in the DVD set as well. In my opinion, the best part of the early, golden years of Soul Train (71-76) were the young dancers (Patricia Davis, Tyrone Proctor and Swann, Damita Jo Freeman, Rerun, James Phillips, Jeffrey Daniels, The Lockers, Little Joe, etc.), and of course the Soul Train Line. Even Don Cornelius himself admitted that those kids were the reason that the first five years were such a huge success! It really would have been nice if the DVD's included just regular dance footage. And even a lot of the performance footage that they chose is peculiar. Instead of including the Jackson 5 episode where they song their old songs and featured Jermaine, why didn't they use the episode where they rocked it out with Dancing Machine, or the later episode where they tore the stage down with Shake Your Body? Where was the episode with The Sylvers singing Boogie Fever, or young Stevie Wonder performing Superstitious? How about when The Lockers would get the floor to perform their routines? Why wasn't any of this great footage used. To be fair, there are a few moments in this DVD set that I like. But over all, I was disappointed. Hopefully someone with a more keen eye can put together Volume 2 of the classic years, or just release full sets of each episode from each early season and monitor how they sell to determine if feasible to release later seasons.

I cannot imagine being the man who chose what to put into just 3 discs..  But they did one heck of a job.
We let tv come in & out of our lives.  We take it for granted.  So if you are like me you will be really surprised at how much pleasure you get from viewing this small patch of afternoon history.
I set aside the time to really look at everything in this set.  The performances are splendid.  And there are surprise duets between artists as well as the expected.  Live, sometimes cut-down acoustic sets. Big-full orchestra sets such as the one given by Little Richard.  I am certain that care was taken on the last disc to offer some of the more sensational dancing by the Soul Train Dancers.  They are loose & having the most unrestrained time of their lives. It's a reminder of how precious & intimate some time on the dance floor can be.  Oh yes... You get to watch Don Cornelius' hair shrink & grow again!
I send an absolute salute to DC & everyone that has been and was a part in the making of this.

They did place to many unnecessary commercial & Soul Train theme breaks into the programing.  However we got this for less than $20.00. Definitely worth it.,1310256000,3,292,4.918367346938775
4172134,1,B003QZO8AY,"Ok, everyone grew up with Soul Train and everybody knows how great a lot of these episodes were!  Rosie Perez, Jody Watley and several other great dancers appeared on many of these shows.  These dancers were the best of America's street dancers.  I couldn't wait to get the 3 DVD set because I knew it had to be great! ...... Boy was I WRONG!!! ...... This piece of crap DVD collection has the most boring, long, extended crap interview BS with Don Cornelius that you can imagine!  I don't want to hear Don Cornelius ramble on about nothing, or see the same Afro Sheen commercial every 2 minutes! ...And every five minutes they are rolling the credits even though it was a very small part of an episode. Where are all the great line dances!  Where are the great dancer shots???  I could have picked 20 better line dance sequences than any of this crap! .... Who thought it would be great to see nothing but musicians lip synching their hits?  What a BAD mix of material from a great show!  They need to make a different series collection and put some thought into it next time.",1307404800,3,1077,4.431472081218274
4172135,5,B003QZO8AY,"If you are a fan of old school TV, music, and culture, you will love this.  Original clips from the 70s with guest stars like Gladys Knight and Barry White.  Extra bonus - some original commercials from the 70s, too!  The hairstyles and clothes are just too much -- a real feast for your eyes and ears.",1304985600,2,302,4.2631578947368425
4172136,4,B003QZO8AY,"I read a few reviews and was a little reluctant about buying this DVD, and as stated in the other reviews a lot the groups were not there, but wow just to see the groups as they were years ago it took me all the way back to my teenage years. The Delfonics, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes with Teddy Pendergrass it was so good to see them. What i didn't like about it was the commercials over and over again.  One or two would have been fine they could have added more groups instead of the commercials to me that was wasted space. However all in all it was great, i have looked at the DVD twice and plan to look at it again this weekend. My children and Grandchildren didn't like it oh sorry stay home,
 me and the Soul Train Dvd can party alone although the feet and legs don't want to cooperate anymore.  If you love old music and enjoy looking at the groups as they were i don't think you will be disappointed. This is real music",1302048000,4,934,4.092896174863388
4172137,4,B003QZO8AY,"Soul Train was always a part of my Saturday line-up back when I was a young girl. It's how I kept up with all of the latest dances and fashion.  It was also one of the few ways that I could catch a Jackson 5 performance and interview.  So, there it is. The big draw for me was that this DVD set features the J5!!!  I also got excited about the Ultra Sheen/Afro Sheen commercials.  Those took me back and all of it is just an exciting trip down memory lane.  Yep, it's true, the episodes aren't full episodes.  I happen to think that this is a good thing.  I love the dancers, but after I viewed for awhile, I realized that I didn't need to see a full 45 minutes of these people, per episode.  No, Thank You.  Everyone knows that the way you viewed things as a child (in my case a tween) is not the way you view things as an adult.  Some of the dancing is now outlandish and comical to me and even some of Don's interviews (for lack of a better word) were downright cornball.  For me, I saw just enough of the dancers and just enough of the interviews, though I wish some would have been longer than others.

There certainy should have been more Soul Train lines.  That was part of the weekend draw.  That's how you could really focus on and select your favorite dancer. One of my favorites was the Asian girl with hair almost down to her calves, saw her.  Still, it was fun to see Don looking dapper, I never realized the quality of his suits.  Some of them still look good today.  Don was cool.  I was okay with the focus being on the guests.  And even though the purchase was all for the J5, it was so good to see Teddy Pendergrass again, looking too delicious.  I couldn't appreciate that when I was 13.  Then there was Marvin, Aretha, Stevie and Smokey and the Isley Brothers.

Then, there were moments when the dancers just danced and that was done just enough.  I also liked how for the most part each artist stayed within their own segment and you didn't have to skip from episode to episode trying to find all of your artists perormances, though there were some exceptions to this.  I enjoyed this set of 3 disc, I give it 4 stars only because there weren't enough soul train lines and since you aren't seeing the show in its entirety some of it can feel a bit abrupt; but this hardly discounts the set.  I've even thought about getting the 9 disc set, but there is not enough detail mentioned about which artists are featured, so I'll wait for more reviews.  All in all, I am happy with this purchase.",1294444800,6,2510,4.231578947368421
4172138,5,B003QZO8AY,"Yes, it's Soul Train but its not about Soul Train. It's a compilation of songs from great entertainers that perfromed on Soul Train from back in the day.  If you are looking for Soul Train re-runs, this is not it.  If you want lots and lots of Soul Train Dance lines, you may be left wanting.  But if you want to see great artist in their early days, doing some of their most favorites songs, with some Soul Train Dance lines (I counted at lest 5 or 6 throughout), fashion trends and styles throughout the years, and done with a smile on your face, then this is it!!  Get this DVD!!  You won't be disappointed. I'm ready to buy more as gifts just to share the fun with others.  And share it with your children.",1293840000,5,710,4.222222222222222
4172139,5,B003QZO8AY,"WoW!! loved ALL the dvd's, they did indeed take me back down memory lane.  The dance moves, the way we dressed in the 70's.  The color, sound and clarity was magnificent.  I agree with others I wished more of the comercials would've been edited out and more footage of the performers, dancers and the Soul Train line could've been left in.  They also cut out the Whispers in one of the dvds, that  sucked...that's one of my favorite groups of all times.  But inspite of that, I'm sending a BIG ""Thank you"" to Don Cornelius for a wonderful trip down memory lane.  This is a keep sake, I'm looking forward to purchasing other Soul Train dvd's when available and or released.  Even my 2 year old great nephew was enjoying the music and dancers.  Well done!!

4172140,5,B003QZO8AY,"I received this set for Christmas, This is an awesome collection and will recommend it to anyone who love music and artist from the 70's, It does put a lot of focus on the performances and a lil on the dancers, but this is how this collection should be, You will never see artist like The Isley Brothers, Kool and the Gang, The Ohio Players, Barry White, Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrass and more on stage again, it has a right amount of time dedicated to the dancers and the afro sheen commercials..
Christmas Day and we sat around all day watching the DVDs and everyone love them and a few of them went on line and ordered the collection while at my house.

Can't wait tile they come out with the 80's Edition",1293408000,13,713,4.360902255639098
4172141,5,B003QZO8AY,"I purchased this DVD for my 70's birthday party.  I had it playing on mute, for my guests viewing pleasure, while the rest of my guests danced and mingled. The people who were watching the dvd, while on mute, DID NOT MOVE from their seats!  This DVD set was great. Great performances from the past. A great gift for you or someone else.",1292803200,3,336,4.317460317460317
4172142,5,B003QZO8AY,"Who doesn't love at Soul Train Line, I love my DVD, it's great! Live performances by Barry White-that one was my favorite, James Brown and (Slim & Trim) Aretha and she does a duet with Smokey-nice!,it spans 1971 - 1991 (though 2 dvd's and most of the 3rd are from the seventies) nice to see the hair and fashions changes -I just love it because I was a 70's teen.",1290988800,,363,4.2
4172143,5,B003QZO8AY,We purchased this DVD set for our adult day service and use it at least three times a week..it's a step back in time and we LOVE Motown.  It's fun too because the Soul Train shows even have the old Afro Sheen commercials.  This is one of the best media purchases we've EVER made!,1289433600,,279,4.148148148148148

I will buy more as and when available and recommend all lovers of soul music to buy the ticket and get on board the Soooooooul Traaaain! Love and peace.

4172145,2,B003QZO8AY,"I was expecting more performances . . . but instead we also have the show introduction almost before and after every performance, it even included commercials. Good memories anyway and good interviews, good interaction with the public as well. Sound quality is just stereo, picture quality is good. If you are a collector of soul music, then is a good buy.",1287273600,,356,4.852459016393443
4172146,2,B003QZO8AY,The video is full of ads.  It should have been limited just to the show without the commercials...  Half of the time is devoted to commercials of products.  Poorly recorded,1286668800,,172,4.666666666666667
4172147,2,B003QZO8AY,Just featured performances from the show...you're lucky if you run into a Soul Train line or a regular dance sequence from the show. I'd rather DVR a full episode on Centric! Very disappointed.,1284681600,29,193,4.878787878787879
4172148,3,B003QZO8AY,"Most of the best acts from the 70s, 80s and 90s were excluded. But some of the performances such as Curtis Mayfield, Barry White and Marvin Gaye were very good. I would like to see an improvement in the subsequent DVD releases.",1284422400,,227,4.428571428571429

4172150,4,B003QZO8AY,"I have only seen Disc #1 so far. Quality is excellent, no annoying on-screen logos. Marvin Gaye and the O'Jays performances are badly lip-synced, the others are pretty exciting live performances. Oh yeah, somewhat disappointing was the screaming lead guitar in the Isley's ""Who's That Lady"" was way down in the mix, barely audible. I will buy this entire set however, just because it's such a great slice of '70s history.",1284249600,7,421,4.943661971830986
8402699,1,B003QZO8AY,"I bought this set through Time Life back in 2010
The reason I'm only giving one star is because who ever mixed the sound at Time Life should be fired! Even though it was from the 70s it still should be way better even by 70s stamdards. Such a great show with great artists and a horrible job by Time Life! Sad....",1511654400,,313,4.064516129032258

8402702,5,B003QZO8AY,"Was hesitant about buying this because of numerous reviews regarding the show not being recorded in it's entirety, the Soul Train line not being on every episode and too many commercials. However, I was happy and grateful to have the chance to see even PARTS of this legendary show I grew up watching on Saturdays during my teens because it wasn't available for decades. I decided to take a chance on this 3 DVD set and am so glad I did! I think Time Life did an excellent job putting this compilation together. It's true you won't see the Soul Train line and Word Scramble on every episode like we did growing up, but those haven't been left out;  you'll still see some of them. It's also true that you won't see entire shows. But you will see some fantastic performances from great artists and portions of different shows. While the guest artists perform, you'll see the Soul Train dancers doing their thing and all of those outfits from back in the day. You'll see Don Cornelius at his smoothest, finest, doing what that brother did best. If you're anything like me, the Afro Sheen and Ultra Sheen commercials will make you laugh rather than annoy you. At the very least they'll put a smile on your face because it was simply good to just see all of that again. In fact, I think this entire DVD set will put a smile on your face. It may not remind you of a perfect compilation, but I promise it will remind you of some really happy times.",1477699200,7,1441,4.417293233082707
