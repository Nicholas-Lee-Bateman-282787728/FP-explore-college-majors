7934673,5,B00005A07W,"I was very anxious about purchasing this item. I always read the reviews before buying and for this title they were mostly not that great!

i was aware when i purchased this dvd that it was not going to be bbc or national geographic - they have some boring and dull videos !

all i really wanted to see was the giraffe hunt and as soon as i recieved it i forwarded it to see those scenes and was surprised that it was not just one giraffe hunt but 2 !

WOW and were they awe inspiring! 1 of them was unsuccessful but the other was (too bad they cut out the scene of how the giraffe actually fell to the ground) BUT just watching the lions ganging up on the giraffe and some of them getting kicked real hard(they survived! amazingly) made my day as i have never seen lions attack/hunt adult giraffe

This dvd was really worth the money! i only paid $ 4.81 total! for the amazing footages

i actually found the other Dvd :

Wildlife Stories: Elephants And Lions

dull and boring, it can be good information for beginers but i knew most of the stuff they talked about and seeing lions hunt zebra, wildebeest or buffalo is really becoming boring for me! seen too many

i have a new interest of seeing lions go for big game!

seen giraffe and elephant killed by lions

and hippo attacked

never seen lions actually kill hippos, crocodiles or rhinos

i am sure they could in big prides!

anyways i have also noticed that there aren't many videos of asiatic lions why?

id love to see them hunt deer, antelope and cattle! never seen any so far

maybe national geographic that people praise so much will get over afriacn lions and film indian lions for a change

anyways thanks for reading ! in the end i highly recommend this dvd to lion fans ....but i guess everyone has their own taste",1120694400,8,1780,4.316265060240964
7934674,1,B00005A07W,"I agree with some of the reviewers in that this movie has no real action scenes (beyond one scene, shot from a far distance, of many lions ganging up to attack an adult giraffe). The asking price of $3.25 for a new DVD (on Amazon marketplace) should have warned me about its quality and customer demand for it, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. Big mistake! Better to stick to wildlife movies made by reputed names like National Geographic or BBC.

The camera work is shaky at times, the scenes look a little unreal and stilted, the ""plot"" is weak, and there is no real action. Avoid this film.",1116374400,11,600,4.405405405405405
7934675,1,B00005A07W,"This DVD is missing all the action.  The predators are seen eating and walking around but not hunting and making a kill.  All the crucial action kill scenes are cut out and the DVD is very unexciting and the cover is misleading.  They might as well

call it, ""everything but the predators hunting and killing.""  I am very disappointed at this very short DVD.",1113177600,11,358,4.53125
7934676,2,B00005A07W,"Not a whole lot of action and not particularly educational. I was disappointed. From the title you would expect a lot more, but... If you are looking for something more inspiring, educational, and some great footage try the series ""Predators of the Wild"". They have at least three videos that are really worth watching.",1112745600,9,319,4.925925925925926
7934677,5,B00005A07W,"The producers of this DVD really nailed it on this one. I've never seen such action in a nature film before....the lions hunting a bull giraffe sequence is chilling, tragic (for the giraffe) and awe inspiring all at once. I am looking forward to Predators IV!",1042588800,14,259,4.6521739130434785
