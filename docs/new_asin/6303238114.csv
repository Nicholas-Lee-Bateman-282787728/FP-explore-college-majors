602346,5,6303238114,"This movie was considered revolutionary in its day and it's still deeply moving, upsetting and powerful. Shot in the first half of 1945 in the weeks after the liberation of Rome by the Americans from the Nazis, it is raw and immediate, telling of events that are searingly fresh in the minds of the director and actors. Roberto Rosselini had to struggle against a lack of money and a chronic lack of film with which to shoot his masterpiece. He scrabbled to find both and put together a movie that is all the more searing precisely because it has none of the smooth studio production values of Hollywood.

""Rome Open City"" tells of the days when the Italian capital was occupied by Nazis. The main characters are a priest and a resistance leader who is both a communist and an atheist. They are thrown together fighting for the same cause. I will not give away the ending but suffice it to say that both are captured and both endure horrific sufferings. The camera does not flinch or look away. It tells the story in all its horror, forcing the audience to see the entire truth.

Anna Magnani plays the other main character -- an earthy ""woman of the people"" trying to get by, to protect her son and to create for herself a life in which she can achieve some happiness despite the dire conditions. She delivers a down-to-earth performance that is all the more powerful for being so understated.

Rosselini used amateurs and was the first to shoot entirely on location. The bomb-damaged city provides an unforgettable backdrop. This genre of movie-making was later entitled ""noveau realism"" -- but it's proper title ought to be just ""realism.""

The extras included in the dvd set are particularly useful and informative in providing a look at how the movie was made and its historical effect on the art of film-making.",1284249600,4,1817,4.686520376175548
602347,4,6303238114,"It is 60 years since I first saw this film in my teens, and its images have haunted me ever since. I have never had the chance to see it again commercially, or at the several film societies of which I have been a member. I welcomed this DVD opportunity with open arms but the experience was somewhat mixed. The main downside is the picture quality that, far from being ""enhanced"" actually leaves a great deal to be desired. Another disappointment was Anna Magnani's performance. This was far less compeling than I recall, and her exit from the movie is ham-acting in the extreme. But these flaws are compensated by the gritty honesty of Rossellini's film-making, so different from the Hollywood kitsch with which most of my generation grew up and that, sadly, has not improved all that much since these days. More impressive, even, than Rossellini's camera work and directorial style, that were surpassed by many film-makers a decade later, are the magnetism of Aldo Fabrizi as the priest, and the rock-solid acting of Marcello Paglieri and his companions of the Resistance. The themes of loyalty and betrayal are played out with superb drama, and the film reminds us of a time that, for the Western World at least, has passed and one hopes will never be repeated.",1275177600,2,1264,4.776255707762557

Open City captivates the viewer almost immediately as it is a moving story. With our first glimpse of Manfredi on the balcony we get a pretty good idea about what the plot will concern. I found it to be legitimately suspenseful and a classic in every sense of the word. One must remember that artists like Rossellini were the building blocks with which our contemporary cinema was erected. There's much that's ""great"" about this movie. The only contrived element, in my mind, was the speech of the German soldier at the very end which was not believable, but at that time it was the first self-denigrating speech of its kind. What is clich&eacute;d and hackneyed to us now was breathtakingly new back then.

602417,5,6303238114,"Open City is a classic that nearly defies classification of genre. Although hailed by serious critics as a neorealist masterpiece, and understandably so, it's strength, ironically, lies in its starker resemblence to melodrama, similar to Luchino Visconti's The Damned.

 What makes Open City a masterpiece is not only its trim, forceful screenplay but Rossellini's ability to utilize the wartime, grainy film stock and presence of the actual, newly defeated fascist army to portray a sense of immediate reality of the occupation and those who so courageously fought against the fascists.

 Open City's plot and characters are black and white, figuratively as well as literally because, to the courageous resistance fighters in fascist occupied Rome, there was no luxury of quibbling over nuances and perspective. This is what fascism did to art in the 1940s. Rossellini utilized this effect to his artistic advantage.

Rossellini's filmmaking style also includes his meticulously judicious use of closeups, which is still one of the most meticulous of any director to this day. The closeups are used to convey sharp changes in emotion, as vehicles to advance the story at crucial moments.

  This film is an enduring film classic that should be seen by not only students of film but all young people. Open City's stark characterization need to be understood in the context of the situation. Audiences can, with hindsight, make good sense of Rossellini's choices and contextualize them as they gain appreciation for this beauty of film classics.",1167868800,4,1544,5.299180327868853

602420,5,6303238114,"Using simple cinematographic techniques and subtle video work, Rossellini was able to capture the startlingly good acting of his characters. However, the film's power is not in the actors' abilities to portray different characters, but in its stark simplicity that historic Rome is able to live anew for the viewer. (Indeed, Open City was filmed only several weeks after liberation and many of the film actors were unschooled and found off the streets.) One can not help but feel the power, agony and brave fortitude of the film's characters.

It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable.

602423,5,6303238114,"This film is often considered one of the first to come out of the Italian Neo-Realism movement, and to a degree it's debatable but in the larger sense I can see where that epithet comes from. This movie is largely a humanistic heroic statement, but its focus is on the utter importance of life... life that is free and unabused.

The setting is Nazi-occupied Rome, the characters, a bunch of Roman citizens who live day by day under the shadow of the Reich. Key to the action is a priest who practices civil disobedience; his friend, a revolutionary; and a pregnant woman who plans to marry the revolutionary. They all try to figure out what's important to them while the Gustapos search for any signs of rebellion, thus putting pressure on their day to day life.

The real mix that helps make this film really empathetic is its focus on heroic inner strength, which can seem to make matters of real life seem lesser, for the purpose of maintaining free and unconflicted life, which it illustrates as most important. Thus the mere act of living is the goal, and the martyr of a hero so others can live the romance. It's quite beautiful really.

It also adds bits of light humor amidst moments of tragedy in a rather grateful way, thus keeping it from being just cynical and depressing. Overall, it really does take the time to care for the simple natures of noteworthy characters.

602424,5,6303238114,"This is simply a milestone film. A picture that broke the walls, specially in those hard times when the shadows of a recent War waggled over the world, in pain, sorrow, revenge, repentant, deception, sad memories and renovated hopes in search of a better world. Rossellini made his masterpiece based on a fiction story according his introductory words but so vivid and so credible that it makes us hard to think about the whole veracity of the previous statement.

The particular seal of the genius is making us to get inside a play with such invisible force that you do not even realize when or where you were engaged to live shoulder to shoulder the lives, times and disgraces of a group of people joined by the cruel fatalism of the omnipresent and repressive Nazis. A mature woman -my always beloved actress Anna Magnani (one of the ten best actress ever born in any age) waits for her bliss, her fiance Francesco will marry her the next day. But in her neighborhood, we have living her sister who works in a nocturne club with the girlfriend of an important resistance member, a immature woman, who has struck by the life, she has walked too many miles, in search of best positions and living selfishly; a bold priest who will work out as fundamental bound.

What you will see all along this movie is the reality shocking your soul and spirit. This script is so sublime that we forget they are acting, but living the struggling environment and trying to make the best they can according their possibilities.

The misery, greed, double moral, SS nastiness, the bold resistance and the supreme of surviving makes of this film a diamantine and majuscule artistic achievement. We should wait eleven years to presence another invaluable gem in this sense: Wajda `s  Kanal.

602497,5,6303238114,"Roberto Rossellini allows his loathing for Nazism to cry out in his disturbing anti war flick, ""Open City"".  Filmed in recently liberated Nazi occupied Rome, the movie accounts for the actions of the Italian resistance at the conclusion of WW2.

An important leader of the resistance Giorgio Manfredi played by Marcello Pagliero is being hunted by the Germans.  His friend Francesco agrees to hide him at his girlfiend Pina's flat.  Pina played by the tempestuous and doe eyed Anna Magnani is aided by Don Pietro, a sympathetic priest played by Aldo Fabrizi.

All is procedding according to plan until the group is betrayed by Manfredi's addicted actress girlfriend.  The very attractive Maria Michi is coaxed into informing to the Gestapo.  Magnani is shot as is the priest.  Pagliero is tortured to death by lecherous German Major Bergmann whose ruthlessness and disdain for compassion makes him a hated symbol of the master race.

602499,5,6303238114,"I watched Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion and Rossellini's Open City one day apart. Renoir's film about WWI prisoners of war was filled with nuance, ambiguity, and a sense of now muddy the waters are in life.
Rosselini's Open City rejected nuance and ambiguity; it was an angry film and understandibly so. Yet both Rosselini's film and Renoir's film attempt to reveal what is noble in humans.
Many criticisms can be made of Rosselini's film--other reviewers have made them--but it is a film that has an impact on the viewer. But the viewer should be reminded of one of Renoir's points: to what exent does the belief in black and white and the belief that good will eventually triumph serve as a grand--but false--illusion.
The viewer of Open City should keep in mind the real world political context of the film: the resistence movement in Italy was often led by communists. This was true in many other European countries during WWII. Rossellini's film certainly presented a communist leader as noble and heroic.
This was a real problem for the US forces which displaced the Germans. Domestic communists often had the most legitimacy of all groups who resisted the Germans. US policies in the immediate post-WWII period often attempted to undercut the political standing of the communists. Some have argued that the post-war Marshall plan for the reconstruction of Europe was based on the attempt to foster pro-business groups in Europe in order to undercut the social standing of communists.
I'm sure that the US post-war European authorities hated Open City because of OC's celebration of the role of communisits.",1055116800,19,1612,5.018656716417911

The DVD is mastered at somewhat less than perfect standards however and the subtitling is part of the film and not overlaid and clearer in image unfortunately. There are no extras on the DVD, nor is there an audio-commentary track which would have been a wonderful addition! (Maybe next time).

602501,4,6303238114,"Photographed on scraps of film abandoned by German forces as they retreated from Rome toward the end of World War II, Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY was immediately hailed as a masterpiece of realism when it hit screens around the world in the late 1940s.  Seen within the context of its time and with reference to the circumstances under which it was made, OPEN CITY is a staggering accomplishment; even so, by modern standards, it feels visually static and slightly contrived.
The great strength of the film is in the direct way Rossellini tells his story of Italian resistance fighters trying to dodge capture by the Nazis in occupied Rome--and in the performances of Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi as two Italians who become increasingly caught up in resistance activities.  But time has not been entirely kind to the film: the story seems somewhat superficial, portions of it lack expected intensity, and some performances seem more than a little artificial, with a lesbian subplot, the famous torture scenes, and Maria Mitchi's performance cases in point.
Ironically, these drawbacks actually result from comparisons with later, still more realistic films that followed its example--and it is a great tribute to the strength of the film that it survives the revolution it started as well as it does. (One does well to recall that at the time OPEN CITY was made such slick Hollywood films as MRS. MINIVER were considered the height of realism.)  Still, because of these issues I would hesitate to recommend OPEN CITY as an introduction to Italian neo-realism for one not already well-versed in it.  But those with an established appreciation of Italian cinema will find it very rewarding.",1025136000,30,1692,5.053763440860215

602503,5,6303238114,"After Melville's 'Army of Shadows', 'Rome Open City' is the best film about Resistance to the Nazis we have.  From the dynamic opening sequence - in which a man, later to be identified as the leader of the (Marxist) Liberation Committee, runs across high-rise rooftops to escape a Gestapo round-up - the tension never lets up.  Rossellini concentrates as much on the mundane details of clandestine activities, pumped up by context, as on action: the practicalities of finding somewhere to hide and sleep; the concealing of funds in books; the different codes and signals used to identify comrades.  But it is the more familiar aspects of Resistance that carry the most impact - the ambush of prisoner trucks; the unflinching depiction of interrogation and torture (including whips and blowtorches); the ritual of execution.
Melville's film was made with the hindsight of three decades, and he was able to emphasise the ambiguity of the Resistance, their own violence echoing that of the SS; their need to live in shadows dissolving, rather than affirming, their identity, forever removed from the society they defend.  Filmed in the immediate aftermath of Liberation, there is no such ambiguity in 'Rome'.  There are no posturing heroics, but these men are heroes, and every important incident - from arrest to torture to execution, is made into a spectacle, something to be witnessed, affirmed.  This is natural enough, and the spiritual showdown between the priest and the Gestapo chief has a fierce power.
Unfortunately, there is a somewhat distasteful division of moral spoils - the Resistance are linked, no matter how loosely, to the Christ-like clergy, family, community, poverty, the nation.  Betrayal and collaboration, which is female, is defined by lesbianism, drug-taking, nightclubs and material greed.  A woman's role is in the home, taking care of domestic problems, providing invaluable moral support.  It is also true that some of the representations of the Nazis that would become cliches in the 60s and 70s - the louchely decadent, sexually perverse, morally defeatist, piano-playing parties in back-rooms - originate here.
'Rome' was the first neo-realist film to win international recognition, and there is an extraordinary immediacy to the external scenes, the sheer novelty of outdoor locations, the rubble of Rome, the lives of ordinary people (caught between the desire to assert normality and the hysterical frustration of doing so in a crisis that is anything but normal), all caught by Rossellini's amazingly supple camera, which seems to catch the very breathlessness of people running (ditto his abrupt editing).
But, at this distance, it is easier to see how contrived Rossellini's realism is, how he is replacing one constructed Truth (Fascist propaganda) with his own.  There is none of the sensuousness of sound or location you get in the proto-neo-realism of Renoir or his protege Visconti.  Much of the film takes place indoor, with the camera conventionally static - this achieves a certain dramatic force, but one different from 'realism'.  The blaring score is pure Hollywood.  On the level of subject matter, the widespread collaboration of the population and clergy are displaced onto a couple of unrepresentative moral weaklings; many characters have a too-obvious symbolic value (especially the children).
But the sheer unsentimental passion, the attention to detail, the cinematic adventurousness, the conviction of doing something absolutely NEW and the narrative drive of 'Rome' still give it an impact today that most neo-realism doesn't have.",1008288000,,3590,5.343971631205674

However, I think many reviews actually refer to VHS version because DVD (released by Image, I think, from Blackwell Films) is even worse than VHS (released by Connoisseur).  I bought this title as soon as I heard it was on DVD, and I was much disappointed to say the least.  The transfer is substandard in overall, subtitles miss whole bulk of dialogues, and most of all, there is even a missing shot from the film (It is the famous shot in which the resistant is being tortured with torchblow).

Shot between January and June 1945, Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City, chronicles the effect of Nazi occupation on the people of Rome a year earlier. Unlike other films of the time, many scenes were shot on location in a documentary style. The lack of funds and good film stock forced Rossellinni to cut corners so the quality of some of the scenes do not appear to have been lit properlynonetheless, the sometimes grainy images add to the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.

After Italy faithfully followed the fascist dictator Mussolini for twenty years and he was finally deposed two years earlier, Rossellini's main intent was to rehabilitate the Italian people in the eyes of the world. No matter how noxious Mussolini was, his machinations could never equal the sheer terror machine which was Nazi Germany, and the Italians, under the yoke of Nazi oppression, became victims soon after Hitler's troops marched into Rome and began terrorizing the populace.

Rossellini's main protagonist is Giorgio Manfedi (Marcello Pagliero), an engineer and Communist resistance leader, who we later learn did 12 years hard time as an anti-Fascist agitator. After escaping the Nazis by fleeing from a rooming house and climbing over rooftops, Giorgio makes his way to the apartment of fellow Resistance fighter, Francesco. Not home yet, he ends up speaking with his next-door neighbor, Pina, Francesco's pregnant fiance (played by the iconic Anna Magnani, whose performance as Pina made her a star).

We're next introduced to Don Pietro, a Catholic priest sympathetic to the Resistance, who is scheduled to officiate at Pina and Francesco's wedding the next day. In Rossellini's world view, Don Pietro and Giorgio are not incompatible despite past conflicts between Communists and a right-leaning Catholic church. The Nazi terror bonds them together and indeed Don Pietro is more than willing to help Giorgio by taking money and information to Resistance leaders outside the city. As a priest, he is permitted to roam about during the curfew.

The collaborators are represented by two women: Pina's sister, Laura, and Marina, Giorgio former girlfriend, who both work at the same cabaret, and receive financial support by prostituting themselves to German officers. The fact that Giorgio never suspects that Marina is a collaborator is perhaps one of the most glaring weaknesses of the script.

Rossellini did a wonderful job casting a dance hall entertainer, Harry Fiest, to play the SS commander in the City, Major Bergmann. Some have complained that Bergmann appears effeminate and it's been argued that homosexuality was often linked to the perverse evil of the Nazis in films of the time. In reality, Hitler and many of his minions, may have actually been homosexuals (see the book ""The Hidden Hitler"" by Lothar Machtan) but the association of Nazism and homosexuality should not cause those in our own time to conclude there is an underlying pathology to being gay (in fact, the Nazis of course persecuted homosexuals but of those Nazis who were homosexual, it's been posited that they didn't see themselves as ""gay""their wrath was reserved for homosexuals of a more liberal or left-wing persuasion).

Bergmann is aided by another collaborator, the Italian Fascist police chief, and with his help, a raid is ordered at Francesco's apartment. Giorgio escapes but Francesco is rounded up and in a shocking, brilliant scene, Pina is gunned down as she runs toward Francesco, who is being taken away in a truck full of prisoners. Francesco fortunately escapes after resistance fighters ambush the truck and free its captives.

Not all the Germans are seen as evilan Austrian defector comes to Don Pietro seeking help but he's eventually arrested by the Gestapo along with Giorgio and Don Pietro after Marina betrays them for drugs and a fur coat (Bergmann's assistant is Ingrid, an apparent lesbian, who is involved with Marina, and convinces her to give up Giorgio.) Francesco manages to avoid arrest when he tarries for a minute longer saying goodbye to Pina's young son, Marcello.

Rossellini creates an odd set where Bergmann's headquarters is in a room sandwiched in between a torture chamber and bar for the officers. Bergmann is more than a one-dimensional characterhe's nuanced enough to recognize that if he fails to gets his prisoners to talk, they'll be considered on the same level of his fellow Nazis, who he presumes will never break under torturethus negating the theory of the master race.

Another great touch is when Captain Hartmann, Bergmann's underling, blurts out that all the Nazis know is ""killing, killing, killing,"" while he's intoxicatedbut the next day, while sober, ends up executing Don Pietro with glee!

Giorgio is the first to undergo torture, and Rossellini makes it even more horrifying when Bergmann opens the door to the torture chamber and allows the audience glimpses of what's going on. He brings Don Pietro in (since he can't see clearly after breaking his glasses earlier on) and gazes at a Christ-like Giorgio, then realizing his fellow resistance leader is dead. In a brilliant scene, the often self-sacrificing priest suddenly loses his cool and curses out Bergmann and his group including Marina, who faints at the sight of her deceased former boyfriend. Don Pietro is of course only human and we come to realize that sometimes religion is a mask for repressed rage.

The denouement involves the execution of Don Pietro up on a hillsidewitnessed by boys from his parish. Notably, the Italian soldiers intentionally fire and miss at the doomed priest, tied up to a chairand the aforementioned Captain Hartmann delivers the coup de grace.

The brilliance of Rossellini's vision lies in his lack of sentimentthe tragedy of lives lost at the hands of monsters is never soft-pedaled. Rome, Open City is a classic due to its powerful script and indelible images.",1478822400,,5945,5.141821946169772

It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable. There is very little in the way of story and the expected brutality of the Germans is what takes up the greater part of the screen time, how predictable.",1386115200,,585,4.801980198019802
7841422,3,6303238114,"I guess for its time, OPEN CITY was a revolutionary film.  It portrayed the reality of everyday life in Rome.  However,  I had a problem with the writing.  I found the characters to be one-dimensional.  It seemed like they were either good (the Italians) or bad (the Germans)--nothing in-between.  I just didn't find the characters all that interesting because they weren't well developed.  Everything seemed to be black or white--no grey.  This is why I found OPEN CITY to be more plot-driven than character-driven.  I guess that's OK if you want to see a documentary.  But if you want to see a film where you can relate to its characters--OPEN CITY is not it.  And it's funny because I found Rossellini's later films to be very character-driven.  I felt I got into the psychology of a guild-ridden woman whose son died in EUROPE '51.  AND I felt I got into the psychology of a dysfunctional marriage in JOURNEY TO ITALY.  Like OPEN CITY, both films dealt with black and white themes, such as life and death.  However, EUROPE '51 and JOURNEY TO ITALY consisted of complex characters unlike OPEN CITY.",1383955200,,1101,4.721052631578948

7841424,4,6303238114,"Rome Open City is a good film, but it is clearly a far more historically important film than an artistically great one (the predominance of hagiography and agitprop make this almost inevitable). Too many times its lead characters, be they Italians or Germans, good guys or bad guys, fall into stereotypes, and the action plunges into melodrama. Pina's senseless death is the best example, as she would truly have to be stupid to do such a thing in real life, with her son right there. But, it does set up the rest of the film's drama and narrative pieces. And there can be some rightful criticism of the film's dishonest portrayal of the Italian Resistance (which was virtually nothing in comparison to the French Resistance), culpability for the Second World War, and relative prosperity and lack of internal destruction versus other European nations. Nonetheless, the film did sweep the Cannes Film Festival and many others worldwide, and it has a number of touches that redeem its clichs, such as having Don Pietro's glasses be broken so that he can only hear, not see, Manfredi's slow death, or the literal killing of two lambs by the Nazis right before Marina betrays Manfredi, which, in its rendering is far more affecting than in its mere description. It should also be mentioned that in a brief scene, an Italian tot's naked bottom half (including genitalia) is shown, which both adds to the claims of realism, and satisfies the dramatic arc of the moment, highlighting how silly most censored scenes and moments in film are. Rome Open City does not broach greatness, but it does entertain and inspire, even almost two thirds of a century after its conception, and sometimes that's something which has even more effect than hermetic greatness.

7841426,5,6303238114,"This film is a great treat on many levels.  There is the story, of course, about the Italian underground during the period that the Germans took over from Mussolini, essentially occupying what was an ally.  This was undertaken when the population had tired of fascism and expecting the war to end without il Duce.  To hasten their exit, Italian partisans began to violently oppose the regime, which fought back with the methods that everyone knows.  It is a riveting story, complete with slow-working spies who seek weaknesses in those connected to the resistance, exploiting loneliness or discontent and seducing them to inadvertent betrayals.  In this, the actors - many of whom were not professionals - are simply wonderful, from the androgynous operative who preys on  young women to brutal soldiers.  Also, the partisans are very interesting types, though I don't want to reveal secrets in the plot.

Historically, this is an important film, a lodestar for neo-realism and in the next decade, the New Wave.  In many ways, it is anti-hollywood:  the scenes are stark and sometimes of real street scenes, the camera often hand held, and the realism is coldly stark.  There is no glitz, nothing sentimental sudden romances though sensitive to the feelings of all the characters, and the good guys don't necessarily get away or even win.  It is tragic, unjust, and brutally honest.  This perspective spoke to Europeans, the survivors of WW II, and decisively influenced all film that followed.

Owning this is a must for any film buff or collector.  Warmly recommended.",1292457600,2,1570,5.054474708171206
