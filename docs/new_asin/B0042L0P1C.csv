4251520,1,B0042L0P1C,I am waiting for the uncut version to arrive somewhere in the world. The UK version has 49 censor cuts according to one seller on the internet. Censorship is an insult to our intelligence.,1297209600,15,188,4.5588235294117645
4251521,4,B0042L0P1C,"So I see they released ""A Serbian Film"" and as promised is cut which in my opinion is a horrible thing. Yes this movie is extreme to the fullest and doesn't really start getting that way till about half way through but if you did your research on this movie you would know that the director is making a statement of how he feels the people in Serbia are being treated by the government there.
Anyhow this movie is about an aging retired pornstar who is running low on money and is coaxed into doing an art type porno with a new upcoming director, he gets into it and the more he goes the weirder things start to get until it becomes unbearable and uncomfortable at which time he trys and quit. The director has other plans though and drugs the actor than has him do a string of horrible things on film for his project, the things he does are truely horrible and down right messed up all the way to the distrubing end.
If you cant handle gore and disturbing scenes of sex and violence don't watch this movie. If you wanna see it do not get the cut version, find an uncut version for the full affect ala kickasstorrents dot com. Again this movie is very extreme but good, you have been warned.....",1296000000,62,1195,4.292035398230088
4251522,2,B0042L0P1C,"Well,it misses over 4 minutes,which are probably the only interesting ones,given you buy this item  for the gore.
The movie itself is not that bad,but still somehow overlong and not really entertaining. It's worth a look though.
Uncut running time is 99.24 minutes by the way.",1295740800,8,276,5.0
4251523,5,B0042L0P1C,"People love to criticize this film. I personally love this movie!! Yes, it is pretty damn twisted but it's incredible. I love the dark imagery, horror, and gore. It really gave me nightmares. Brilliant.",1520640000,,202,4.970588235294118

4251525,5,B0042L0P1C,"Crazy movie. But everyone says how it's the most intense movie, yeah it has a lot of things that fall in that category but it wasn't all that to me. That probably sounds horrible, like what is wrong with me, right? But i feel it could have been worse in the shock factor i guess. Don't get me wrong tho, it is shocking at times.",1518825600,,328,4.061538461538461
4251526,1,B0042L0P1C,"this is one sick movie that you cant unsee. if you like this crap then you to are sick.. I heard it was on Netflix and was curious.. well curiosity killed the cat.. I suggest don't even think you want to see it. I hope I get over this soon..

4251530,4,B0042L0P1C,On my journey to discover the most disturbing movies of all time I stumbled upon this little gem. I'm pretty sure it's not the unrated version because I remember a certain baby scene being more graphic. Anyway if you're into dark and disturbing this film is for you. Right up there with Martyrs (the original) and Salo or the 120 days of Sodom.,1516406400,,344,4.476190476190476
4251531,1,B0042L0P1C,Ordered this movie because I heard a lot of hype that it was gory and a huge shocker. Well the shocking part is correct the gory part is correct but the content itself is just appalling. After watching the film I put the disc through my paper shredder and said 10 Hail Marys and Im not religious.,1515628800,2,296,4.2105263157894735

The only reason anyone would watch this is for its shock value. If you delete the shocking parts out of it, its worthless. Think of it as if you bought a carton of eggs at the store and after you got home with them, you find out you  have a carton of empty egg shells. That is what the 102 minute version of this movie is like.",1508544000,2,449,4.1022727272727275
4251539,1,B0042L0P1C,"Please be aware before buying that this is a censored version of the movie. A lot of original parts were taken out that made the movie as messed up as it is known for.

4251541,4,B0042L0P1C,Pretty disturbing and an interesting story. The graphicness was pertinent to the tale and not senseless. Not for those who are easily offended. Liked the ending. I probably won't watch again.,1505779200,5,191,5.193548387096774

4251544,5,B0042L0P1C,Sickest movie ever. Seen it awhile back almost didn't make it through the whole movie. Still haven't got the Balls to watch it on Blu Ray yet. Needed it for my collection in case it gets banned.,1505001600,,194,4.27027027027027

4251549,1,B0042L0P1C,I loved this movie before and I came back after a while to rewatch it. I rented it only to find that the subtitles were off quite a bit making it virtually impossible to follow. I couldn't understand why they would make them so fast.,1499126400,,233,4.2
4251550,3,B0042L0P1C,"I rented this as others described it as the ultimate horror movie. It is not. Be warned--if you rent the uncut version there are NO English subtitles. If I hadn't done extensive research before viewing it, the story would have been hard to follow. The film does not live up to its hype. I only wished it had.",1498867200,2,308,4.327586206896552
4251551,2,B0042L0P1C,"Not worth the hype.  Oh, it's the most horrible movie - vile, disgusting, gore ridden thing since Human Centipede.  Um, not quite, which by the way I actually liked The Human Centipede both 1 and 2 for the sheer imagination of it.  Horror had not seen anything like it so the concept was new and fresh.  Ok, so A Serbian Film has its moments of shock value (two in my opinion but I won't spoil it) but imaginative?  No, I wouldn't say that.  A stick with you long after you watch film?  I wouldn't say that either.  The first 45 to 50 minutes is almost unbearably slow unless you just like porn for the pure sake of watching porn.  The 'shocking' scnes do not come into play until much later in the film.  Be warned, if you use the subtitles as this is not in English, the subtitles are way ahead of the actual movie so you are always waiting on the film to catch up to the words.  It can be watched just fine without them, though, you'll get the gist.  Old porn star gets picked up by some guy/people making unconventional porn flicks for elite customers.  He signs a contract to do the films without realizing what they actually want him to do.  It IS pretty vile and as mentioned, your mouth will probably drop a few times thinking, 'they really did THAT?' only to answer youself that yes, they did.  Would I watch it again?  No.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Much ado about nothing.  Sure, watch if you're curious but if you are offended in any way about the thought of porn, small children, newborns, rape and murder all in one movie - don't watch it.  Remember, it's just a movie.",1498867200,2,1603,4.28
4251552,1,B0042L0P1C,"Rating this film as ""I like it"" or ""don't like it"" is not that simple- it is everything that other reviewers have already described it as- sick, depraved, twisted, you name it, it is all of that and other adjectives that don't even exist to describe the level of horrific that it is. But like something you can't bear to watch, repulsive, voyeuristic reflexes compel you somehow to witness it. I have no idea how the actors and crew were even able to work on this with a clear and reasonable mind. You be the judge of whether this film should be vilified for being disturbingly shameless and exploitive or praised for delving into the scariest, most unimaginable recesses of our psyches. I gave it one star because of the content and the extremes to which it went for shock value. However, if you can get past the gratuitousness, there actually is a plot and decent acting to be considered.

That said, on a technical note, the captions don't synchronize with the film at all- they're on FF, which is INCREDIBLY irritating.",1498262400,3,1023,4.6208791208791204
4251553,5,B0042L0P1C,The most disturbing movie of all time. I'm watching it in very small chunks only so I can make a parody of it. Most hardcore horror fans can't take this movie.,1497830400,,159,4.161290322580645

4251567,5,B0042L0P1C,"I bought this for my 7 year old and he LOVED it. He's always nagging me to watch it again. I've seen it several times and I love the chemistry between the husband, wife, and child especially at the end of the film. The portrayal of the main character is a great way to show kids how to treat women and children, as well as the less fortunate. There's a character who only has one eye and you can tell through his actions he is very distraught. Milos, towards the end of the film, gives him a gift that forever changes the way he sees the world. Overall, great movie and would highly recommend.",1492041600,11,593,4.2105263157894735

Justified ""in the name of art"" and the ""Serbian history""? This movie is just pervers, and have a look at wikipedia about this film. I think there were good reasons why the movie was cuted outside Serbia.
I'm against censorship, but there are limits, and this film is above any limits.

4251570,1,B0042L0P1C,This could've been an -ok- movie if it didn't have baby and child rape in it. There's good movies out there that is sick and twisted and then there is this nasty POS that somehow was allowed to be released. It was sort of a drag the rest of the time too. There isn't much else to contribute to my review because I really have nothing good to say about it. If you despise child rape then you'll thoroughly hate this movie.,1491091200,,421,4.146341463414634

4251605,4,B0042L0P1C,"I don't know why I feel compelled to write about this film.  Im not a reviewer, I generally consider myself more of a passive fan of films than a cinephile, and there are already plenty of reviews of this six year old film.

Like many people in the western world, Id heard of A Serbian Film due to its notoriety over  well, over baby rape and necrophilia.  If you don't already know the synopsis, the movie is about a retired actor (Milos) that agrees to do an art film for an exorbitant amount of money.  When things get weird (an understatement considering the nature of this movie) he quits the film only to suddenly wake up the next morning with a gun in his hand, numerous injuries, and no sign of his wife and son.  As he tries to piece together what happened, he finds video tapes that show that he was drugged and made to take part in some horrific acts.

While I am a fan of horror, I like my horror films to be along the lines of supernatural or existential.  I like playful films like The Conjuring and Poltergeist, I like horror films with a deeper meaning and social commentary like the Living Dead series and They Live, and of course Im a fan of art films like Eraserhead and Nekromantik.  In spite of the numerous cute names out there for films like Hostel and The Human Centipede, Im generally not into torture porn or gornography.  Genre conventions are always hard to apply in many cases and as such, I do make exceptions to this in the name of a good story:  Ichi the Killer, The Midnight Meat Train, and the first Saw come to mind.  Call me a chicken, but in general I just don't have the stomach for over the top violence.  The problem is that I love movies to the point where when Im watching them, I get so immersed in them that it feels real to me.  When Im watching Aliens, even though Ive seen it a hundred times, I always root for Ripley when she takes the first real offensive against the xenomorph beast.  I fall to pieces everytime I see The Fountain and watch Izzi die all over again.  I always wish I were inside David Lynchs head when I watch Eraserhead.  Yes, I even giggle like a child when I watch Finding Nemo because Im right there swimming next to Dory.  Sadly, this is probably why I rarely find a movie that I don't like at all, and realistic gory violence is just hard for me to sit through.  When I watch Poltergeist, as dear as that movie is to my heart (thank you mom for making that the first movie I ever saw), that may as well be my face that Martin Casella is peeling off in the mirror.

So why the interest in A Serbian Film?  Well first off, I was curious.  Not curious enough to shell out the $30 it cost for an uncut DVD intentionally made to look like a bootleg back in 2010 (you don't want to know how much that version is worth now), but still curious.  Second off, this is a landmark film of sorts.  Its one that pushes the boundaries of filmmaking in the same way that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did in its time.  I saw Cannibal Holocaust for the same reason.  Mind you, I regret watching that one because the scene with the turtle was taking things way too far, but at least I can say I saw it.  I have High Tension in my DVD rack (Ive yet to manage the courage to watch it mind you) because it kicked off the current wave of French Extremism the same way Ichi the Killer started a flood of violent films in Japan.  A Serbian Film is the same way in a sense.  Many movies in the past have touched on necrophilia and child sex, but never has one come about thats as brutal as this was reputed to be.  Not many films get banned these days (weve become numb to the violence!), so one that manages to get banned in nine countries in the 21st century must really be setting a new standard.

There is another reason I wanted to see it, though:  Artistic merit.  In spite of the notoriety it was getting for its content, director Sran Spasojevi has asserted that at its core, its a critique of the Serbian government (hence the name seemingly having nothing to do with what the reputed nature of the film is.)  From an interview with Spasojevic, This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about.""  Hes gone on to add further explanation to this stating that Serbian cinema has no rules (judging by this movie, not even rules of decency), but the bulk of funding comes from the government and as such, films tend to reflect what the government wants the world to see.  I say the world because in the case of Serbian cinema, they're marketing it toward western audiences.  Most of the world knows Serbia for one thing:  Conflict.  Many Serbian films have an eye toward the emotional and psychological horrors of war and the ensuing poverty.  So at its heart, A Serbian Film is supposed to be a movie with a political agenda, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in horror.  Night of the Living Dead is a classic film not just for kickstarting the zombie craze, but because the core of the movie was a statement on race relations in the 60s.  George Romero has always made a point of incorporating social commentary into the Dead movies; Dawn of the Dead was a parody of consumerism, Day of the Dead was a criticism of military being autonomous from the governments they worked on behalf of, Land of the Dead was a satire on American lifestyles, and so on.  Its the same reason Im a sucker for Disney films:  I like messages encouraging positive change disguised as mindless entertainment (Im looking at you, Inside Out!)

So enough about the premise of the film, what about the film itself, right?  Ill start with the superficial stuff first:  The soundtrack was EXCELLENT!!!  Its electronic oriented, but not in the way that Junkie XL fluffed and filled out the background (in a good way) for Mad Max: Fury Road or Mark Isham abused pop-techno for Blade.  I imagine in 2010 this was very cutting edge music and even now as I listen to it in the background, its beautiful.  It mixes then-current mellow dubstep (think less brostep like Skrillex and more of the original funky and soothing DUBstep like Benga and Distance) and the earliest roots of trap.  Its a brilliant technique not often seen in movies.  There are a few moments in this movie that establish tone and ambiance (car rides, walks through abandoned buildings, etc.) and rather than let some ambient piece play in the background, they have this hard but slow groove pounding out in the background while this HUGE razorsharp synth reaches out and cuts you.  Its hard to explain properly but trust me, in context, its a wonderful effect and really sets the tone of the movie.  (For a great excerpt of the soundtrack, check out Pazi Sta Radis by Sky Wikluh).  Its heavy as hell, but its so foreboding.  The director took a risk in using a soundtrack like this, but it really pays off in the same way that the music for Wrong Cops almost becomes its own character in the movie.  My all time favorite movie soundtrack is Cliff Martinezs orchestra-gone-electronic score for the Solaris remake (completely off topic here, but to this day Im amazed that there were no electronic instruments used in that soundtrack because the instruments were played in nontraditional ways that made them sound otherworldly), but Id have to say this is easily one of my top ten movie soundtracks.  The fact that there wasn't an official soundtrack released makes me sad.

Cinematography?  As dumb luck would have it, I recently stumbled on an interesting article about movie color palettes, so thats fresh on the mind.  In short, color palettes help to establish the tone of a movie in much the same way that a cohesive color set makes artwork become more emotional.  The colors in this movie are stark.  Its like somebody cranked up the contrast, but in a good way.  For the horror scenes, the dark colors are deep shades of black and the whites often integrate hints of brown and red.  When the characters are out in the real world and away from the filth, it integrates bright blues and rich shades of orange.  The camera work is really well done.  One scene that particularly stands out is when they start filming the principal photography of the art film.  Milos is in this hallway with a cameraman on either side of him.  The audience is positioned perfectly in the center at the end of this hallway.  Milos is staring directly at the audience, the cameraman to his left is facing the audience as well (recording what Milos sees) and the cameraman to his right is following Miloss movements at a perfect ninety degree angle.  To me this conveyed a sense that the people behind the art film were professionals in a way that no dialog could have demonstrated.  You know from watching their perfect synchronization that they had done this before.  The cameramen being in black with sunglasses conveyed a coldness to them as if the synchronization were mechanical.  That moment made me afraid for Milos.  If these men turned on him, they would be unstoppable machines.  The horror scenes were very well shot.  Without painting too graphic a picture, I can say that there was a reason why the film was investigated by the Serbian government.  The cuts and the placing of the camera made things look uncomfortably realistic and two moments in particular made me have to pause and reassure myself that its just a movie.

And of course just to get it out of the way, theres the plot.  In case you didn't already figure it out, its graphic as hell.  If you really wanted to see this movie, you probably did six years ago, but if you didnt, its available on Wikipedia if you must read it.

So before I move on to the real meat of what Im trying to write, Id like to touch on the acting.  Its hard to judge an actors ability when they're speaking a language thats different from your own native tongue, so you don't know if they're voicing their inflections properly.  A film like this, a lot of the acting is done less through dialogue and more through expression.  The look on Miloss face as he watches the tapes seems authentic, the victims seem full of genuine horror, the director is believably mad, and Miloss son was convincing in his post-experience catatonia.  Honestly, I hope the kid that acted that part is okay after making a film like this because I really believed in his performance.

So now you know all the technical details of the film.  The soundtrack is engaging, the cinematography is beautiful and clever even during the most relentlessly brutal scenes, the plot is  well, it is what it is, and the acting is worrisomely authentic.  What about the content?  What about the message?  In all honesty, Im still a bit on the fence about it.  As a shock piece, it succeeds most certainly.  Though many movies have scared me, this is one of only two I can think of that I had to take a break from because the violence was hard to handle.  The baby rape scene and the decapitation necrophilia both made me pause.  The camera angles, the cuts, and those god awful sound effects (Id really prefer to not go into this any further because the visual is already shocking enough) were convincing and really makes me wish I could unsee them in the same way I wish I hadnt subjected myself to the tortoise scene in Cannibal Holocaust.

There has always been a line between art and shock.  Its a hard line to pin down and lord knows people have been trying since the very beginnings of cinematic history.  Is They Live a legitimate jab at consumerism or is it just a fun Friday film?  Is Pink Flamingos an exhibition of artistic style or is it just grotesque pornography?  Is Pulp Fiction a social commentary or  just an excuse to be vulgar?  While I watched A Serbian Film, I couldn't help but think back to Jrg Buttgereits Nekromantik.  Admittedly, I hunted down and watched Nekromantik at a time in my life where I was after something truly stomach-churning and a movie about necrophilia seemed like it would fit the bill.  But I was rewarded with something that was far from just a strictly shocking movie.  Without being told to look for it, I found Nekromantik to be a fascinating look at subjects such as existentialism, sexuality, isolation, and even ironically, the desensitization of cinema audiences.  It took scenes of gore and transposed them to a different field where the protagonists girlfriends relationship with a corpse was a reflection of the protagonists own inability to cope with intimacy and dream sequences of a dead rabbit were indicative of the liberation from mortal toils that comes with death.  This movie that I sought strictly for its controversy acted as a lens that allowed me to better see the nature of life itself.  But what about A Serbian Film?  What of the message?  I feel that A Serbian Film is the opposite of Nekromantik.  Whereas with Nekromantik I wasn't looking for meaning but found it anyway, with A Serbian Film I was searching for meaning and honestly its kinda hard to find.  If I hadnt been told that A Serbian Film was a commentary on life in Serbia, I would have never known.

So knowing in advance what to expect as far as meaning and being on the lookout for it, there were traces of it.  Its harder to spot as an outsider to their culture, but there are certain a-ha! moments.  This portion assumes youve already seen the movie, but heres a blow-by-blow of moments I thought were meant to be symbolic.  I feel the fact that Miloss brother was a police officer was important in this role.  Its a little blatant, but in this case, the brothers actions represented a raping of the people.  The government sees something that the people have, and it devises ways to take them.  I feel that most of the raping needs no explanation as we Americans love to use rape analogies when it comes to paying our taxes.  From the newly birthed to the recently deceased, were all raped by the government.  The costar that has her teeth pulled and is raped literally to death could be symbolic of how those that stand up against injustice are themselves attacked.  Most of the dialogue in the movie is about staging events to come, but a lot happens toward the end of the film as far as verbiage that could be interpreted in more than one way.  For instance, when its revealed that Miloss brother is raping Miloss wife while Milos is raping his son (I think Im setting a world record here for how many times a tense of the word rape has been used in a document), the brother comments that Now, were a true Serbian family.  The timing and phrasing of it means more than just the perverse sense of closeness.  The government has taken what its wanted and in the course of its actions, has made Milos, the common citizen, take whats important from his own family to the point where the son is psychologically catatonic for the rest of the movie.  It could be emblematic of soldiers being made to go to war and fight against their own.  It could also mean that the economic ravages caused by the government forced his family to suffer.  I feel that as far as a message is concerned, the real star of the movie is the director.  The director is always pulling strings, whispering in Milos ear, telling him and his crew what to do, and when he dies, hes replaced by another that will carry out his original plan.  I like to think that maybe the director was Slobodan Milosevic, former Head of State of Serbia.  He rose to power and brought his nation to conflict with numerous nations including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, and Slovenia.  When he went away, he was replaced by a new director that continued the same mission, leading to the conflict that caused Kosovo to declare independence.  Alternatively, the director could just be the government behind Serbias film industry.  Before he died, his last words were your actions are worthy of a film.  This could be interpreted as Well, now that we have a battle scene and some sympathy for the audience, the government will fund this film or it could be more in line with my original theory in that now that youve proven you can fight, you should become a soldier and fight for Serbia.  The nurse with the drugs I think is the Serbian film industry.  She exists to provide the people with something that makes them horny and angry.  (I hereby declare the official term to be hangry.  Wait, thats already taken)  She injects people with her harmful product at the discretion of the director (government) and in the end, suffers and slowly dies because of it (the bloody pipe she masturbated herself with) while everybody watches.  Im also seeing meaning in the thugs that beat up Milos in the street.  The thugs were harassing some poor beautiful woman (another country?) and rather than intervene, the Serbian people (Milos) sat there and masturbated to it until the thugs beat up Milos.  When the film crew arrived (the Serbian government) they quickly dispatched the thugs, were about to rape Milos, but they let the woman go.  It wasn't something they forgot in the movie either, they blatantly showed the woman walking away from the scene.  This is deliberate and intentional as the film crew made no move to stop her.  If it had been any other gorno film, she would have been killed too and probably raped.  Its hard to say what this could mean exactly as Serbian political affairs are not something I know much about outside of a casual glance at Wikipedia, but perhaps she was Kosovo i.e. the potential part of the nation that got away?  And the scene where the grandmother offers up the granddaughter after her own daughter was murdered?  The way it was so staged and artificial gives the impression of government manipulation i.e. Well, youve killed my daughter, you want my granddaughter, too?  But also, later in the film, the young girl is found out in the neighborhood unhurt.  The government was willing to rape everything from infants to the dead, but they left the girl alone.  Not only did they not rape her in the end, but she was even specifically shown as the only real survivor of this whole movie.  Why?  Thats a question Im going to have to ponder should I ever decide to torment myself by being reminded of the existence of this film.

So is A Serbian Film an important political message or just a simple splatter film?  Its hard to say.  This movie plays jump rope with the line.  It shocks the hell out of the viewer with imagery that the audience never could have imagined wanting to see.  Though the message does feel intentional, it was very deeply buried in the same way that The Matrix is supposedly an analysis of the dichotomy of human choice. (Yeah right, its a timeless action flick with no inherent meaning or moral lesson.)  The examples above are relatively few compared to the overall movie.  Take for instance the penis hostage scene.  (How often does one get the opportunity to type out that phrase, right?)  I cant think of a possible reason for its existence other than to propel the movie into the next scene where the thugs beat Milos for masturbating in the street.  Why does it matter?  Because I think if this film was truly designed with a political agenda in mind, they would have found a way to make such a climactic event into another statement.  Sure small things could be forgiven for the sake of moving the story along, but something so pivotal as an escape and so deliberate as penis hostage?  It leads me to think that the writers decided that a political agenda was necessary not as the cause of the story, but rather as a supplement, an excuse or a scapegoat.  Yes, were really pushing it with this film, but were sending a message!

All in all, take what you will from it, the bottom line is that this movie is grotesque.  Movies like Nekromantik that deal with lurid subject matter handle it very tastefully.  One thing I am thankful for in this is that I sometimes worry that the internet has made me a soulless monster.  The fact that I had to stop A Serbian Film at the baby rape scene let me know that theres still something humane in there.  Other than that, this movie is very hard to stomach.  Its repulsive on so many levels.  There may be a message to it, but it may not be worth the psychological battering you're likely to take in watching it.  So the questions remain unanswered:  Is this film important?  Only time will tell as its only been six years since its release.  Maybe this somehow influenced the French extreme movies in the same way that this movie was evidently influenced by Italian splatter and giallo films.  (Seriously, what the hell is going on in Europe to make you guys churn out this stuff?)  It certainly didn't have an effect on Serbian politics nor the worlds view of them.

Is it a good movie, though?  Id have to say that it is.  Its well made on so many fronts.  I love the soundtrack to pieces, the cinematography conveyed so much, the actors were flawless at their jobs, and I felt in the moment the whole way through.  It sucked me in and made me personally experience horrors that Im fully prepared to never experience again.

And now the big one:  Can I recommend this movie?  This is a question Ive asked myself through the course of all this bantering.  Is this a movie I could for instance take to my mom and tell her You should watch this.  Its very graphic, but the underlying message makes it worth the experience?  I can justify most things in the name of art.  I think Pisschrist is a profound piece of artwork, I admire the man that painted the Virgin Mary in elephant dung for knowing that it was an honorable and sacred piece that would ultimately be considered controversial, I think Banksy is a transgressive genius, and I will probably end up defending Shia LaBeoufs artistic leanings with my dying breath.  Recently someone posted online about how some glasses were left on the floor at an art gallery and the people at the exhibit thought it was art.  I would have probably been one of those people staring at the glasses wondering at their meaning.  Art is a broad topic, but for each person, the definition of art has those lines.  So would I recommend to my mother that she watch A Serbian Film?  I cant.  Its well made, but the premise that it could be in any way artistically, politically, or socially relevant eludes me.  This is not art, its ultimately very well produced shlock trying to pass itself as a message.  I cant say that Im going to take any long-lasting meaning or insight from this experience.  I will however probably need therapy to erase the sounds of a baby being raped from my head.  Now if youll excuse me, Im going to go wash my mouth out with beer and watch some Disney!",1464307200,5,22780,4.52274951076321

The validity of this idiom notwithstanding, the hope of transcending the very human experience with the most hideous of projections rises to the level of shame and the requirement of absolution.
Some of the scenes within this film are so frightfully celebrated as to render them beyond the scope of human experience. Having the protagonist at a birthing table engaging in sexual intercourse with a baby just delivered. while still holding the umbilical cord speaks loudly about the direction of this project and the need for looking elsewhere.

Never has a film created a sadness for who we are, and what we accept within our midst. While guarding the right of these filmmakers to curry toward their trade we hopefully will guard our sense of separation while keeping our distance and shaking our souls in disgust.

By the end of this film I felt relieved for the main characters death scene. I genuinely wanted these characters to die because what they endured so they could be in peace. This film is banned in many countries and tops the list of most disturbing movies ever made. However, the writing and cinematography is excellent. This isn't a slasher film. You care about the characters and are affected by what happens. If you're in the mood for some visceral blood and gore, stick to Saw or Cabin Fever. This movie will get under your skin and end up reviewing certain scenes every time you close your eyes.",1457481600,3,745,4.609022556390977

I have watched a lot of really crazy sick movies and this one is right up near the top!!! Only a few movies have made me feel really dirty and like I had just done something illegal, Cannibal Holocaust, Human Centipede 2, Gummo and now A Serbian Film. There were many scenes that were hard to watch, the Baby Scene and the Incest Scene were messed up. I have the 104 Minute version and that seems to be the one that is the least edited. This Movie is not for everyone and I am not sure it is smart to tell some people you have even watched it. If they have heard of it or know what it is about then there opinion of you will probably change. The Soundtrack was well done it worked really well with this movie. If you like a movie that will make you change the way you look at how people can treat each other then give this movie a try I highly recommend it. Watch this movie and give the August Underground series a try as well, those are some other hard core violent movies.

4251651,3,B0042L0P1C,"""A Serbian Film"" (2010) is directed by Srdan Spasojevic. This film is about Milos, a porn star, who is misled into acting in a film project that involves being drugged and then led into abusive and violent acts. His journey into a hell leads to the destruction of all that he loves. The movie has ultra extreme scenes of violence that leap into the psychotic and nightmarish. Some scenes are sometimes so disturbing while others are so ridiculous that one feels that they are witnessing a very black comedy along the lines of A Clockwork Orange where the words ultraviolence seem apt for this film. Earlier on the film looks very commonplace and pedestrian so it misleads one into believing that nothing much will really come of it. Maybe for this reason the film is all the more shocking when the graphic violence is heaped upon the viewer into a tailspin of debauchery. There is however the same crazy manic black humour at play when the patron of the film project is lifting himself off of the floor after having had his head beaten into the floor by Milos, as he cheers Milos on like a crazed movie director, and as Milos wrecks havoc on all those who have dishonoured him. The film indulges in the representation of manic sexual frustration as drugs push Milos over the edge of morally permissible barriers. The creepy ending reminds one that there is no end to the cycle of violence.

This blu-ray is an edited version of the film, as the complete, uncut version is 104 minutes in length, while this version is 103 minutes long. As far as I can tell, without going frame by frame, all of the original film is here except for an edited version of the scene with the newly born child, which I think is actually more effective here, since the scene is shot out of view and only suggested, and it doesn't drag on as it does in the uncut version.

Ever since leaving the industry hes mostly been hanging around the suburban abode, he shares with his beautiful wife Marija (Jelena Gavrilovic) and their ten year old son, Peter (Uncredited child actor), guzzling large quantities of booze and sampling his old porn tapes.
The household, however is facing impending financial difficulties, due to Milos inability to find work, so when hes contacted by a former colleague Lejla (Katarina Zutic) who offers him a sit-down with a hot new director whos looking to revolutionize the porn business through his latest project, an highly avant-garde experimental adult film, whom he want Milos to star in, he quickly accepts.
When Milos first meets the director, Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) he instantly offers up a $million contract for Milos participation but theres a catch, Vukmir will neither unveil the screenplay nor enlighten Milos regarding the story, which initially frustrates him but with the promise of a major payday, he nevertheless signs the contract anyway.
As production begins however, Milos finds that Vukmir creation is clearly a much more perverted depiction of pornography than even he cares to be associated with. But when he threatens to relinquish his involvement in the project, he becomes enmeshed in a sickening and ever escalating turn of events involving nauseatingly acts of psycho-sexual madness including paedophilia, necrophilia, torture, desecration of the flesh, from which there is no turning back. As the devilish Vukmir appalling acts of depravity spirals towards its horrifying conclusion, Milos realises that the grotesque narrative of Vukmir wickedly debaucherous vision, might not exclusively pertain to him as a active player but might very well also include that of his family.

Much have been said and written concerning Srdjan Spasojevics shockingly vicious debut feature, A Serbian Film (Srpski Film) but just how much of the various watchdogs contributions constitutes valid constructive criticism and conversely intransient fire n brimstone hyperbole, lets inspect...

No matter how you cut it, theres no point in denying the films controversial nature and savagely graphic depiction of sexual violence, what is debatable is the filmmakers reasons for employing such unflinching tactics in their portrayal of the phenomenon.
After its completion and subsequent festival run, the director Sedan Spasojevic was quoted with saying that the film should be view as an allegory reflecting the anguish and suffering that the Serbian people had gone through in the Bosnian war and its aftermath and that they, for short felt f.....d from birth through death
To which I retort; Why didn't you make that film than! Because A Serbian Film sure isn't it.
In my mind, theres nothing wrong with wanting to push boundaries, especially when you do it as effectively as this film manages to do, but writing off the perverse elements on display as simply metaphorical is at best disingenuous, at worse downright hypocritical.
At no point are we presented to elements such as poverty, class struggles, politics, corruption or the various social institutions within that region, theres simply nothing anchoring the story or its characters to the republic of Serbia (other than the spoken language) and for all intents and proposes this particular story could have play out anywhere in the world.
A Serbian Film is painted in broad strokes of un-nuanced black and white and as a result, the picture comes across as purely exploitative.
Its quite clear that the filmmakers are going for shock value first and foremost, regardless of the claims of it being about so much more.
Any film that has a guys retina penetrated by a monstrously erect penis will have a hard time playing the social realism card.

The violence presented throughout the film, is just as hysterical and over-the-top as its gallery of caricatures on display.
The worst offender being Sergej Trifunovics goatee sporting Vukmir who seems almost animated as a character that isn't so much man as pure unrestricted Mephistophelian beast-man.
He and the rest of the cast aren't bad by any means, just severely embellished, an approach that only serves to further illustrate that the film as a whole, shouldnt be taken all that seriously.
However this certainly doesnt mean that the level of violence on display and the nature of it, aren't among the most extreme and controversial ever committed to film or in this case video.
But I would argue that this is exactly what quality exploitation films is suppose to do, although A Serbian Film does come frightfully close to crossing the line of what is acceptable to employ in the name of entertainment.

Technically the film is marvel to behold; it might even be a tad too glossy and slick given it distressing subject matter (which also debunks the filmmakers art-house claims) but it is nevertheless faultless executed, which is an extreme rarity for a film with such brutal content.
It doesnt make the film any easier to watch, mind you but as viewer I valued it quite a lot as professionalism is always nice addition in regards to cinema.
So forget any and all talk about art-house credentials and instead enjoy the film for what it is; a brilliantly crafted yet vile and tasteless piece of exploitation that is as savage and merciless as anything you could ever wish to see.
This may be too much but might I suggest a double-bill consisting of this and Tom Sixs equally deplorable The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence (2011) for a guaranteed overdose of the sickeningly perverse.
Be warned though, it might make you crave the roughest of sandpaper instead of a loofah, the next time you take shower.

Severely cut or outright Banned in most countries around the world, A Serbian Film did however get a completely uncut DVD and Blu-ray release courtesy of Cinematic Vision in both Sweden and Denmark back in 2011 (But since than a lot of retailers in both countries have opted to remove the film from stock... Controversial indeed)
Since the Swedish version was released first, that was the one I picked up and were going to take a closer look at the Blu-ray now.
There really isn't that much to say as the release is a bare-boned affair, Im afraid but it is 100% uncut which is the most important factor anyway.
The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen, aspect radio 2.35:1 and the print looks fantastic all round.
The soundtrack held in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS-HD and both are highly effective in a forceful and even balanced presentation.
The disc offers subtitles in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish and is a great release from a technical standpoint, at least.
Sadly I don't know where the English speaking audience can turn for an official and uncensored copy of the film, since even the North American release was cut.",1435449600,4,6978,5.064347826086957

There is a scene in this movie where a baby is born and is immediately raped, for crying out loud.  I couldn't get past that, but I have read in one of the reviews on here that a little boy gets it, too.  No one should ever see this, and if you like this kind of stuff, you and anyone involved in the making of the film should be punished in the worst way imaginable. I heard that this was a decent foreign film to watch if you are a horror fan.  I am angry at the magazine that told me that, and I will not be reading that again.  This is not a horror film!  Horror makes you scared, makes you think there is a boogeyman in the closet.  This movie makes you sick, and tells you that the boogeyman is nothing compared to the sickos out in the world.  I am not saying any of this to intrigue you into watching this film.  Please, do not.  I don't want the makers of this film to make any money off of it.

4251675,3,B0042L0P1C,"This movie is about a guy that used to be a porn star.  He has a family now and needs to make a score to secure some money for them.  One of his old female co-stars gives him an oppurtunity to do one last porn film that is ""different"" and will help out with his family issues.  So, it is a fork in the road situation.  Do it and bad things will happen or don't do it and your life will be content.  Well, he chooses to do it.  He meets up with a creepy porn producer/director and tells this guy that they are shooting a new kind of ""porn"" that specific buyers with specific tastes will pay big bucks for it.  The premise of this film is ok but it is a sick movie with some alleged political statements hidden in the more graphic scenes.  It goes to some places that other horror movies or directors wouldn't or shouldn't go.  Research this movie before you watch it so you don't get sick and surprised like I did.  All I heard about this movie beforehand is that it was a good shock film that was doing well around the world in festivals if it wasn't getting banned at the last second.  You won't forget it after you watch it.  It also makes you feel like you don't want to tell anyone that you watched the movie because you don't want them to think different of ya or throw you in the looney bin..lol.  I've seen the cut version and actually prefer that version over the uncut version because it cuts down the two difficult scenes in the movie to watch.  Some people like the uncut version of the movie and hey...to each his own.  I just don't think they had to show certain things in this movie to make its point.  They could've done it in a different way.  Good Luck...lol.  Oh, the clear DVD case package for this release is horrible.

4251679,4,B0042L0P1C,"This film is definitely screwed up, let's get that right off the bat. I put off watching this film for awhile due to the hype that surrounds it. I like watching/seeking messed up films. When I did get around to watching it, I thought it was a decent idea with really effed up parts thrown in here in there. The concept that he didn't know what he was doing is awesome. That way the writers could take the story to the outer limits, so to speak. Of course the ending was nasty but I kept thinking to myself the ending could have been much worse. Maybe I am jaded and have already watched way too much in the shock genre.  The movie is sick, but not the sickest movie ever made. Suffering always hits home for me way more than straight up gore. The newborn scene is ridiculous. I wish the Human Centipede films existed the way this scene did. Meaning, a five minute scene would have sufficed for that idea (and not 3 painfully lame full lengths). The film I happen to think is the ""worst"" or most psychologically damning is ""Men Behind the Sun"".  That's my opinion and it's probably because it's based on reality.

4251687,4,B0042L0P1C,"It took me a while to review because when I first watched this I felt convicted and bad, the very first one I watched was completely uncut and unrated from the DVD but decided to buy the Blu-ray after I realized this is just a film but there's meaning to it; the utter truth is there sick adulterous people out there and I believe the director exposed that in the film. The Blu-ray uncut version doesn't show the child's face revealed after being raped so I'm glad I choose the Blu-ray version. Theres a natural sexual instinct of nature when us men are driven to be animals in bed but the point of clarity in this film is don't be senseless and preserve your humanity with decency. This film was very tough to accept and watch at first sight because of all the sick sexology given but the plot and storyline was very good. Very well filmed. Very graphic in sexual matters! Honestly no other film can compare to sexual horror yet!
Publicity makes it seem like the worst film in the world, but it's only exposing the sickness sadistic people that remain under the sheets; sometimes films are too close to home, that's what's fearsome to others sometimes.
From 44 minutes and below of the film was not disturbing or bad but after approximately 45 minutes and above of the film, that is where suspense and sexual horror kick in. The final sexually graphic scene that begun approximately at 1hr23minutes to 1hr26minutes was at first seeming like a seduction of primitive behavior unfiltered for you'll see 2 individuals on bed with maroon sheets both with their bare bottom showing, while the director welcome Milos to penetrate freely both of them while the 2 individuals were masked. Then when the masked are removed, conviction will follow.
This film I wouldn't say well worth buying but is worth trying, overall I thought it was a good film for Horror, Drama, and Suspense. But definitely not a romance film, the only romance part maybe the very beginning when Milos was having sex with his wife (this scene supported Erotic Rape Fantasy somewhat) and Milos sex tape at the beginning of the film; although the pornographic content of that scene where the boy was watching Milos tape is exposing parents don't apply parental discretion like they should which is clarifying the subversive actions of youths sexual impulses because its based on whats viewed that gives the affirmation of acceptance. The film also demonstrated portrayed scenes of infidelity and unrestrictive sex in most seductive ways by man being worshipped from women in traditional dissensions and actions when shown a woman disguised as a secretary or teachers assistant performing willful fellatio in a private room while hes married, when Milos was provoked to be receptive to allow himself to deflower an adolescent girl with parental acceptance and initiation from her grandmother, and wife giving permission for Milos to prostitute himself to other women for wealth (polygynous marriage). There was also realism of gluttony from Milos brother whom secretly desired Milos wife, even when he had a beautiful woman fellating him, his greed and jealous corrupted him and he didn't appreciate what beauty he had; that scenario can also be reflected on life from a fellow kin, friend or associate.
Even though the film I thought was good, I thought it would have been better if they didn't add that baby part, for that made me sick, I literally hated that scene. The drama was very good and understandable, Milos felt disgusted by the things the director put him through but fought back in the end. The director of Milos film kept ordering potent sexual aphrodisiacs injections that made him become a mindless sex machine, that's the horror but the thought of this aphrodisiac can be interesting; by revealing the harm it can inflict on others if you not sensible in what you do. Thereby, this reflected all those portrayed highly potent male sexual enhancement, by demonstrating how it can truly harm than do good.
Another part was tragic reality that sometimes gluttony will provide the action of adultery and betrayal, this is what Milos was revealed when he notices his brother was having graphic anal sex with his wife, right beside him, when his mask was taken off. A terror that many of us men hope to not go through, for it's a terrible thing witness your brother to rape your wife.
I normally don't write long reviews but this film needed it. People suggest this film is for sick, or sinful people but not true this film creates awareness on how sick the world can be. All the pornography out in the world I believe the director of the film blended the horrifying one's into a film of graphic violence to make awareness and horrify individuals on the negative impact of pornography can have on people.
Not all of the film is sexual graphic violence because some is just kink or sexual nature but the majority is sexual graphic violence and sick sexology. That majority is about 90% sexually graphic violence and sick sexology. Brutality is given, even in the moments when you think it's interesting but you're in suspense of happens next, then there a complete twist unto something unpleasant or disgusting.
The odd thing about this film is that between The Human Centipede sequel and the A Serbian Film; many critics rave that A Serbian Film is worst but I completely disagree, for I think something cinematic-ally shown as mere reflections of reality is more important (referring to A Serbian Film) than some sick surgeons looking to alternate a devilish artistry of wiring a persons mouth to another's butt (referring to The Human Centipede sequel). Personally, I find the opposite, and that opposite is The Human Centipede sequel is the film that's unbearable and nothing of interest to watch but something gruesome and failed cinema. While the A Serbian Film is a mere reflection of majority the bad of sexology and mere reflections of life so this makes it important to have, as a reminder of not to dehumanize ourselves. Media may classify this film as a misogynistic film, but thats just a construction of making individuals feel they should hate misogyny and join feminism but truth is this film is not a misogynistic film but an awareness film based on philosophy, dissensions, realism, primitive sexual responses, drama, victimizing innocence (which is the emotional empathy and conviction portion) and violence.",1427068800,4,6400,4.883272058823529

I love this movie not only because of this, but because its beautifully filmed and you can tell how carefully the films creators put it together.  Theres so much emotion and gore in this film and its done is such an artistic and stylized way it makes this movie, in my opinion, a masterpiece.  Other than the sheer disturbingness of certain scenes, the incredible development and believability of its characters is the reason this film hits the viewer so hard.  We are let into each characters life, behavior, and relationships with each other; we feel as if we know them personally and are let into their deep thoughts without making it obvious. Even the films antagonists are carefully developed as humans with emotions and desires, something pretty rare in horror movies.  Vukmir, the porn director responsible for the shocking events Milos has to endure, shows great passion for the films that he creates. The soundtrack of this movie also intensifies it- changing from a major to minor key and adds tension to the increasingly daunting scenes.

Like Passolini's ""Salo"" this is either love or hate but definitely not easily forgotten.

I can see why the film has garnered its reputation, particularly when dealing with children in certain scenes. This subtext is intregal to where the film ends up. But there is another equally disturbing layer not discussed that doesn't deal with politics or taboo sexuality.

Modern male sexuality, Viagra, and of course the pornography industry are the more interesting aspects of the film.

After being doped with this concoction by the director, our hero loses ALL control of what actually is personally sexually stimulating to him. He prides himself and built his reputation as a porn actor on his natural staying power. This drug triggers instant erections and also something within him that puts his confidence past overdrive and into a power mode. He seems to feel like an unstoppable force intent on ravaging anyone or thing. Scary thoughts... an army of rapist zombies!

I haven't seen this frightening aspect mentioned in reviews. Anyone interested in other films with similar themes might want to check out ""Bullhead"". Not a horror film nor anything like it, ""Bullhead"" is an intense drama about a young man who becomes addicted to male hormones after a horrific attack as a child.

Not sure if the cover has changed but my DVD (uncut of course) came on a piece of brown cardboard (as it was supposed to,, not bootleg). Why'd I bring that up? I guess the different cover art caught my eye. Whatever. Who cares about the packaging anyway! As I was saying, why am I leaving a review now? A big reason I didn't bother with it was because I thought, ""What self-respecting horror freak wouldn't check this out?!""  I still feel that way but something else changed. My understanding of it, in all of its glorious psychological depravity, has since deepened.  At the time of my viewing, I thought that, besides it being an awesome horrorific cinematic experience, it was a fantastic expression, if not sublimation, of the post-traumatic psychic ""stuff"" that the Serbian people are working through. Trauma (in the psychological sense) is a big interest of mine and one of my specializations, professionally speaking.  I viewed it from a culturally bound perspective that I was ever so grateful to be allowed to share.  Since then (all 3 years!), I no longer see it as culturally bound. At all. It is an amazing artistic allegory for our civilization as a whole.  I posted a comment to a movie group that best states what I mean: ""Now, I loved 'ASF'. To me, its the pinnacle of post-new milleniium horror. I mean that in the sense of it bringing something novel to the table, totally unsympathetic to the audience, without limits, transgressive, and genuinely shocking. .As such, it could never have been made in an English speaking country.  It conjured up a definite visceral experience, which is what I hope to get from horror. Also, the film has psychological meaning that transcends itself. Aside from it being born from the Serbian post traumatic collective unconscious, it reflects the current state of the dominant species on this planet as it is consuming itself. And at the 11th hour, it will likely cannabalize itself. ""  To me, ASF(Uncut; anything else is not the whole movie and as such provides only an incomplete viewing, and consequently understanding) is not only a great horror film but it is very compelling.  Provided it exists, in the future it probably will be studied in college critical theory departments, if not forward thinking doctoral psychology departments. Right now, its too raw, brutally honest, and too real to be anything but banned, derided, misunderstood, and relegated to what are considered to be the fringe elements of society to ""enjoy"". More than entertainment: ASF Uncut is uncomfortable horror at its finest.",1403136000,4,2615,4.887133182844244

4251754,3,B0042L0P1C,"Okay so first off, before I even considered to watch this film. I did a number of things, I read some reviews and then watch youtube for reaction videos for the ""Newborn"" scene.

It starts off fairly typical family bs. Guy use to be a porn star and wants a better life for his family(wife and little boy). So he gets the offer he can't refuse. He thinks it basic typical artsy film, but things start to get a little weird for him. There are a few scene in between with his brother and family. You can see the brother has an affection for his beautiful wife. He talks with the Missus and she basically tell him to drop out of the film. He goes to the director says no thank (at an hour in if uncut) This is where the ""Newborn"" scene takes place. It's really not as bad as it is made out to be, but does bother you little. The crying is mainly what bothered me, but it was very minor. Nothing is really shown, but it is very much implied. Your mind will create the scene. Milo (the ex porn star) still leaves and while driving, his vision goes blurred. Things go pretty south from here for poor Milo. The rest of the movie is pretty much, just connecting the memories of the night before. Milo is contentiously drugged from this point on with horny, sleeply juice. There is a scene I consider gore porn, where Milo beheads a woman while having sex. (Not very graphic or goretastic in my opinion) The only other scene that bothered me is, when Milo is taken into a room with two bodies covered on a bed, Milo is done with the larger of the two bodies and goes to the smaller. The camera shows issues and gushes of blood from the smaller body. You find out who is behind it. The ending doesn't surprise me, but it kind of right in my opinion. You don't come back from that.

I am not a normal person. I have been watching tons of horror movies for over 20 years, I would suggest HIGHLY to research this movie before thinking you can do it.

But despite the mediocre  format, I happen to own a copy of that version. Now the run time for it is 104 minutes, and I watched the entire thing.

 Personally, I liked the movie, however, I think it's a bit too overrated when it comes to one of the most horrifyingly disturbing movies of all time. Controversial? Sure, but not as bad as you might think....that is if you're a horror fan. ANd you're used to this kind of stuff.

Anyway, I saw that various websites, like BLOODY-DISGUSTING.COM and MOVIEPILOT.COM, were posting about how this all-new never before seen version of A Serbian Film was finally coming out FULLY uncut. I was a bit confused, because there was already an uncut version of the film released, as I mentioned earlier. So I checked it out on amazon, and right away looked at the run time of the film. 104 minutes. Just like the one I already own. Now I checked both regions (Both are Region 1) and I don't understand why they would release another edition of the movie even though it is the same exact version.

I'm starting to think this is the OFFICIAL release, considering that by the looks of it it is in an actual DVD format. But I'm still not quite sure why they would release the same exact version?

I'm still debating on whether I should buy this and replace it with the one I already have, since this format seems to look a lot better.

4251781,4,B0042L0P1C,"So, with all the hype I finally sat down and watched the film. With much angst over the infant rape scene I had heard so much warning about. Yes, yes, the concept and idea of it was disturbing, but the scene itself was rather unremarkable given all the yammering about it.

I sat there after the ""most horrible"" scene and thought, ""well if this is all the film has to offer, it is going to be pretty damn boring"". I am happy to say, I was wrong entirely. The movie as a whole was much better overall than I expected, especially given the fact that I truly thought I had ""missed"" something given the lack of effect the infant scene had. The acting was actually fairly decent, it had a plot, and yes the movie in general was disturbing.

I am always looking for a film that will mess with my brain. I grew up in a time where slasher and gore films were all the rage, and I lived on a steady diet of them, always trying to find the next great ""horror"" movie. As I grew up the slasher/gore films didn't/don't really cut it so I moved on to find movies that will leave me queasy from a psychological stand point. Something that won't let the brain settle easy after seeing it....this one fit the bill. I won't lose sleep over it, but I agree with other posts/reviews that there is a certain feeling after seeing it. Just as you think ""there is no way what I think is going to happen, is going to happen...they would never do that"" and next thing you know, there it is.

I would not classify this as a horror movie, nor fully as an exploitation film, as some people have...I think it belongs in the corner by itself, in it's very own category.

I would recommend the film to anyone that wants to watch a film that leaves them thinking ""what the HELL did I just watch""?

Fair waring you may feel like you need to take a shower after watching this film.

Overall, I think it is worth a watch....",1379289600,,1887,4.227777777777778

It was so nice to watch a horror movie that was extremely original, it wasn't filled with this CGI garbage like every single horror movie that's popular right now is. If you have a week stomach, you probably shouldn't watch it. But if you're a horror movie buff like me, this movie will blow your mind.
Every single thing about it is original, the story line, the acting, even the death scenes are all very original.
Also, if you like horror movies where it ends happily and the ""bad guys"" get whats coming to them, then you're in for a huge surprise if you watch this.

Story lines (yes lines) firstly how far is one man willing to go to be set for life? that guy, ex-porn star living a miserable boring life being offered to do ""art"" and be set for life. Second story line, the fine lines between art, porn, snuff, and violence. It's a rather blurry line and is ultimately in the eye of the beholder. But that's a different story that I can't type enough for that.

I've seen some pretty messed up stuff. Everyone told me ohhh it's pale in comparison to Serbian Film, watched it, fast forward through a lot of it, called it a mile away, no surprises, nothing. Maybe it was the hype?

Long story short, save your money, it's not worth it. You'll watch it once, wish you never saw it (in a good or bad way) and it will sit on your shelf where everyone will question it. you tell them about it and then you'll be subjected to it again.

Even though this film was the most disturbing film I have ever seen, I give it 5 stars because it achieved a goal that all film makers of gore try to achieve.

4251786,3,B0042L0P1C,"This actually rates between 2 1/2 and 3 stars. I bought the uncut version because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Honestly, all the reviewers calling this flick hard-core pornography, a snuff film, and most disgusting movie of all time are b-sing you. The cinematography is much better than I expected, but the story is alternately boring and ridiculous. NOTHING in this movie is all that shocking, unless you have a really sensitive temperament, are the squeamish, easily-offended by anything type, or an arch conservative. If you want to see real porn, get it on the internet. As far as the plot goes, many critics over-dramatize the events portrayed as being disgusting, over-the-top provocations to test the audiences' tolerance for revolting sexual and murderous acts. The nude sex scenes are soft-core, no actual penetration is shown, no REAL genitalia are shown, and the ""infant rape"" scene is fake, shot in darkness. The rape scenes are no worse than you would see in a Hollywood production with a hard-R or NC-17 rating. In fact, I found the many sex scenes to be so hilariously over-acted that I laughed. I did not find the brutality of the beatings, drug-induced sexual mania, and the beheading scene to be any more gross or gory than what you would see in any guts, gore, and sex horror flick. The over-the-top climax was truly hilarious, with our bug-eyed, enraged protagonist using his supposed over-sized erect member to kill a guy by ramming it into his open eye socket. When the camera pulled back, it looked to me like the lead actor was wearing a fake strap-on dong you can buy at any porn paraphernalia store. The price for this publicity-overblown flick is ridiculously high for a film so overhyped by media critics and film reviewers. If you must see it, buy it. But be warned: lower your expectations to be shocked, horrified, disgusted, or sexually aroused. As I said earlier, if you want to see hard-core sex acts, they aren't in this film.

I was looking for disturbing and difficult to watch, and that's what I found. If that's what you're looking for than this is the movie to watch. However if you can't stomach something like A Clockwork Orange, don't even bother. A lot of people like calling it mindless tripe and nothing more than shock value horror, but I disagree. There are messages to be found in the film, though I think the main directors point was lost. The point was to show the climate of Serbia, it's financial issues and all that, but I just wasn't getting any of that at all. For the main family being poor they sure had a pretty nice home. Again, if you're just looking for demented and disturbing this is the way to go. Very well acted and directed, and even some kind of message in there...somewhere.",1373241600,3,943,4.425287356321839

Big mistake -- for a movie with beautiful cinematography and an attractive and capable cast -- not to mention an extremely provocative plot -- this movie was huge, and I mean huge, let down.  I have heard it described as a masterpiece.  It is a masterpiece, a master piece of junk.  The gore, nudity, sex, and violence did not bother me at all, what bothered me was how it falls apart.  I do think that the gore/nudity/sex/violence was not used constructively and was used, instead, for the shock value that lesser movies employ to make up for other shortfalls.  I think that people who hail this as masterpiece may simply want to appear cool or more hip than people who are shocked and repulsed by the movie.  I know good from bad and this is the latter.  I would love to see this premise re-done into a quality production -- one that totally involves the audience; instead we are mere spectators to exploitive sex and violence that transcends into what it supposedly despises, it becomes a caricature of itself.  I understand what we may take away from the movie on a few different levels but I find it poorly executed.  The most controversial scenes may be distasteful to some but they are not what turned me off from the movie, the movie turned me off from the movie.  Do not waste your time.  One more thing, I have read this compared to MARTYRS -- this movie is nowhere in the league of MARTYRS.  MARTYRS is a brutal wonderful film, this is a wonderfully brutal film and that's all it is: brutal.

If you removed the porn (and there IS porn in here) and the torture/rape scenes, there isn't much to watch. This movie tries SO hard to be over the top & I find the soundtrack to be very very annoying. I guess that was the point.

I think this was supposed to be about what happened in The Balkan War to a certain extent, but I think that would have made a much more interesting movie. It just seemed to go for full on shock and exploitation, nothing more. I don't see how it was so well acted, although this is in no way a low budget movie. It's not in any way shape or form a typical B movie. The torture scenes (which was all the horror there was pretty much) could have easily been made more realistic if they had chosen to do so.

Anyways, if you want to watch it watch it, but if you think it's going to be a horror movie, it's not. It's more like a sausagefest. If they cut maybe 10 minutes from this film, NOBODY would care about it.",1368403200,4,1234,4.03265306122449

This isn't your typical slasher flick, this is what should be called a horror porn flim as it has lots of sex.

This is NOT cut, as the name implies it really is uncut because before even ordering it on amazon (and do not do this) I spoiled it for myself by looking up the entire plot on wikipedia only because I wanted to know what was so controversial about it, and just by reading about it, you question whether you should watch it or not. I say give it a go if your very much into horror, and not for someone who enjoys horror here and there. However be prepared to do alot of reading, as the film does have subtitles in english, and certain parts of the film I had to rewind to read it again because the subtitles go pretty fast.

Only a minute or two has been deleted, but those horrific flashes of deleted film were needed to make the intensity and power of this film palpable.
Among the scenes, two were imperative to the plot in establishing the unspeakable heinousness of the deranged director and in showing what the outcome was in establishing the beginning of Milos' downfall and break from rational, sane behavior.
Other scenes cut may not have detracted from the film's plot, but they did dilute from the ""gore factor"" quite a bit.

The result is that the film's power has been lost and it's imagery rendered impotent in establishing the reaction for which it was intended.
A huge, huge disappointment.
Best to pay the extra 10 dollars to get the ""Director's Uncut"" version if you want this film to have a permanent space in your DVD/Blue Ray collection.
Half way through it I was so keenly aware of the cut scenes that it ruined the entire viewing experience for me.

It made me furious that my money was wasted on this pale rendition of an otherwise unforgettable film.

""A Serbian Film"" is a classic movie of infamous renown that deservedly has it's place in the annals of cinematic history. The film not only aspires to question moral and ethical choices on a personal level, but strives also to serve as an allegory to the plight of the Serbian people and their perceived mistreatment in regard to their history and the government rule that made such a history possible.

To watch it figuratively neutered and castrated was a disgrace to the viewer's
intelligence, the plight of the Serbian people and an insult to the cinematic vision of the film's director.
The producers may have felt that the film served as an allegory of it's government ""raping"" it's own people, but sadly in this version the film itself I feel was also violated and ""raped"" for greed and profit by it's censorship as well.
It may be an exaggeration, but would the film ""Psycho"" be nearly as effective as a ""shocker"" without it's infamous ""shower scene""? Try to imagine ""Psycho"" without it.

To pay 10 dollars more for the 2 minutes or so that were cut is ridiculous but necessary if one wants the intended powerful impact for which this notorious film has deservedly become infamous.",1365724800,2,2304,4.75

This sum of money would finally set his family (a wife and son) for life.  What follows is a walk through hell...where everyone is involved and there is no escape.  I can't give too much away but If you can't handle brutal (and I mean brutal) images, then don't even bother.",1362441600,,1077,4.282178217821782

4251813,4,B0042L0P1C,"Sick, twisted, and disturbing are inadequate terms used to describe Srdjan Spasojevic's notorious new Exploitation picture, A SERBIAN FILM. Reprehensible, ultra-violent pornography is much more accurate, but in a world that has become numbed to sex, violence, and gore in a film, is this not what we crave? Spasojevic brings us the next generation of shock, working off of similar themes to those found in Pier Paolo Pasolini's SALO and Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES. The only world in which A SERBIAN FILM can be made is a world in which it can be sold and consumed, and the record number of reviews for this film show that viewers the world over are ready for this extreme form of entertainment. For those of you who have watched this film and protested its graphic content, you must ask yourself ""Why did I watch this film in the first place? Was it not my own morbid curiosity that drove me to see it?"" A SERBIAN FILM is easy enough to avoid just in reading the film's synopsis:

Milos, a poor and retired porn star, is offered the deal of a lifetime to return to his previous profession for one final film. The catch is that he is unable to read the script, a fact that he will soon live to regret as he and his family are pulled in to the director's horrifying new vision...

Drugs, rape, incest, torture... All of the things that a proper society looks extricate or ignore are prominently displayed on screen in graphic detail, and for no better reason than to disgust. The fact that this film has been censored and re-released in several edited forms in a day and age where 'Uncut' and 'Not Rated' have become huge selling points can speak to the film's power. Its continued sale, however, only serves to prove Spasojevic's point: That there is a market for everything... 'Newborn Porn' not excluded. A SERBIAN FILM is only softened by the fact that it is so professionally made and cleanly shot, placing the filter of fiction over the characters' actions and the audience. Had Spasojevic employed a hand-held approach and bought in to the ""found-footage"" trend, we may have been faced with dangerous and potentially criminal results. We must then ask ourselves, ""What's next?"" Who will be the one that takes that next step, and when they do, will we watch? It is difficult to justify a film with such explicit content, but, if for nothing else, A SERBIAN FILM becomes a valid form of art when it forces us to confront alarming issues such as these in any medium.

Don't watch this movie it's very f***ed up, trust me on this one people, from Salo, to Cannibal Holocaust, to everything else I
I've seen in my life, and trust me I've seen them ALL. I mean every single one of them, each and every scary, frightening, disturbing, you name it, I have it or I've seen it online. After this one, I'm out man, for good and i'm not looking back. The only emotion you get from this film is anger, I can see why some would give this a high rating but to be honest I don't think I can do it, not even a saw or a paranormal, nothing. To the newbies in the game don't watch this movie, but if you do please, be alone don't watch it w/ the homies or the girl, the wife, the son, nobody. Cause they'll think your nuts, and you are... If you are going to watch it be weary and cautious for at least 2 or 3 days you will still be a bit pissy, but I gaurantee you may not watch another that compares. Good luck, and I say to you all in the horror world... goodbye, i'm doing comedies now...

4251815,4,B0042L0P1C,"I just purchased (and watched) the 'un-censored' version of ""A Serbian Film"" - had to get it thru US based Amazon.com as the, much talked about, additional 'minute or so' of excised footage is apparently 'too brutal for Canadian sensibilities' to handle - so Amazon.ca doesn't list it! Certainly didn't appreciate having to pay the stupidly exorbitant $12.95 postage for the US shipping - making this a $40.00 film by the time it arrived in my mailbox - those were some pretty expensive 'minutes' of un-censored action! Was it worth it??!!

I have watched a lot of weird transgressive flix over the years - generally I like them - the 'quality' of that genre of film can certainly be 'all over the map'. ""A Serbian Film"" has excellent production values, acting, and gore FX and in many ways is not really any more shocking than numerous 'mainstream' gross-out horror works such as the 'Hostel' and ""Saw' franchises (despite reviewer's statements like: ""Makes 'Hostel' seem like a Disney film"" etc.) - though it DOES definitely have more overtly sexual elements included... which always seems to 'get people going'. as they say. The 'slickness' of the production decidedly helps to suck one in and as the 'atrocities' presented within the plot gain in momentum and outrageousness there are many 'uncomfortable' moments to be 'enjoyed' (or NOT!) by the viewer until the final scene of nihilistic perversity is played out. I found myself initially sorta 'aghast' in the immediate aftermath of viewing it and went back to look at what other reviewers of the film on Amazon.com had said about it. One of the most interesting 'comments' was the info that the film's director. purportedly, made the film as a 'blackly satirical statement on the condition of the people and government in post-war Serbia"" - IF that is the case it certainly puts a whole different spin on the film and would warrant a different set of criteria in assessing its' subject matter. With or without such a 'redeeming' political sub-text the over-the-top sexploitational aspects of this film certainly seem shocking at first, but (upon deeper reflection and comparison) are not all that different or MORE shocking than much similar fare that has been produced in the past. One of the notorious 'censored' scenes involves a woman who has been tortured by having her teeth knocked out B4 she is orally raped - grim stuff!, but then I remembered an identical scenario in the '70's ""Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Shieks"" where a girl was being sold at a 'sex slave auction' and her prospective 'buyer' demanded similar oral modifications. In another 'censored' scene the infamous 'new-born porn' is 'revealed' - a concept that actually went so 'over-the-top as to become ludicrously hilarious. Other previous 'underground' horror flix such as ""Deadgirl', ""Aftermath"", ""Guinea Pig"", ""Grotesque"" etc,. ad nauseum - ALL feature creepy concepts and buckets of gore that are at least as harrowing as the imagery contained in the 'Serbian' film!

Personally, I feel there is actually something about the word ""Serbian"" in the title that imbues this film with more import and impact than it might otherwise garner. The fact that the real-life war atrocities in the, relatively recent, 'Serbian' conflict occurred lend a special nuance of creepy-ness to the production & viewing experience... without that 'connection' it becomes merely another sick-twisted fantasy to be 'enjoyed' by fans of the genre. One reviewer pointed to the recent film ""Whistleblower"" as an example of a movie that deals with some of the more 'actual' horrific events of human smuggling and sexual violence against women that are still happening in some parts of Eastern Europe (and elswhere!). I gave it a watch and can honestly say that I found it to be way more disturbing than 'A Serbian Film'. In the final analysis, I would say that ""A Serbian Film"" is an 'effective' and, surprisingly. well made bit of exploitation that 'appears' to push the boundaries of the genre - but REALLY doesn't offer much that hasn't been done elsewhere previously - just where DOES one go from here, and WHY?!",1358467200,4,4125,4.994186046511628

It begins like a porn flick (During the first 30 min I was often tempted to switch it off, but I held on.), but then it takes off. Mix porn with horror, add some David Lynch, some Sion Sono, some Gaspar Noe, and serve it cold, and you have ""A Serbian Film"". Compared to mainstream productions of these days, it comes as a low budget film, but that's part of its charme. An Arthouse film. The acting is brilliant! When it begins, the actors are like in porn flicks - bored, doing their job. As the intensity grows, the acting becomes better and better.

The lunatic Vukmir is correct that brutal torture and murder sell like crazy in our world.  If you're on this product page reading this review, you're likely interested in watching fictional graphic violence from ""the comfort of your arm-chair.""

4251823,5,B0042L0P1C,"Okay let me start by saying that I have seen many horror films(in fact I have over 1,500 of them in my collection), however, nothing I have ever seen compares to A Serbian Film in any way, shape or form. Everyone who I have ever talked to who has viewed this film has had different reactions to it. Most reactions I've encountered were either disgust or love toward the film. Before watching the film I decided not to read any specifics about it, and boy did it pay off!! Unlike The Vomit Gore Trilogy, and the August Underground trilogy which were all made to look grainy which automatically puts your guards up to prepare to watch extreme gore, A Serbian Film has AMAZING cinematography which gives the audience a fake sense of comfort, causing guards to be dropped and ultimately not preparing people for the subjects/images they are about to see. Simply brilliant! While the director explains that this film symbolizes the lack of control Serbian citizens have because of Serbian Govenment, some people feel as though the director only made that statement to get away with putting over the top scenes in the movie. Regardless of the reasonings the director had, the fact remains that love it or hate it the images from this film are not likely to get erased from your head. I found myself very sympathetic and connected to the main character Milos (a broke ex porn star, who agrees to go out of retirement for one final film for the sake of his own family's financial well being, little does he know what's really in store for him). Aside from feeling a connection to the main character (showing a well written story and amazing acting), I also praise the film due to the fact that while there are some graphic scenes, many times it is what's left out to a persons imagination which presents true horror, it shows how dark a human mind can visualize things when presented with certain subject matters in the right way. This film DEMANDS attention, and it certainly took hold of mine from the opening scene, and continued on until the final credits!! 5/5 stars. Highly recommended to those who are fans of extreme films.",1352160000,21,2123,4.664
4251824,1,B0042L0P1C,"This is the worst tasteless film I have ever seen,  I literally snapped it in half and tossed it in the trash where it belongs,  disgusting.",1351296000,13,140,4.346153846153846
4251825,5,B0042L0P1C,"The first thing you will immediately notice about A Serbian Film is the quality of the production and acting. For a film of this nature, one would generally expect a B-movie atmosphere. This is simply not the case, and is perhaps the one major reason this film has intrigued me so much. The character development in the early portion of the film was also surprisingly well done, and was very convincing to boot. It has been a long while since I've seen a good horror film that allowed me to feel something for the characters on screen. The family is relatively normal, albeit Milos' taboo job of being a porn star.

As far as porn is concerned, we see very little gratuity in this area. Certainly there is nudity, but it is mostly done in a tasteful fashion. It is a paradox of some sort. To see this piece of cinema that undoubtedly falls under the moniker of ""torture porn,"" yet so much is held back. Indeed, the gore and the themes presented are taboo and will not appeal to everyone. The film is genuinely intense. However, I did not feel that the gore or the nudity itself was the reason why this film was intense. While there are a few scenes that will stick in mind for a long time, the overall somber atmosphere and psychological torture you (as the viewer) will undergo is what I found most gripping.

When it comes to adult themes, this film holds nothing back. We see rape, child rape, genital torture, and similar things. Still, so little is shown. But, what will stick with you is what is said. The final words in the film change the dynamic of the movie, make it far more disturbing, and ultimately cause this film to be one of my favorites in the horror/thriller genre.

So, in conclusion, if you can stomach a good amount of gore, don't mind gratuitous nudity, and are interested in seeing a movie explore such adult themes, you will enjoy this for sure.",1350432000,5,1870,4.478005865102639
4251826,4,B0042L0P1C,"OK. So if you are reading this you are looking to see one pretty sick film. I am going to try to give a review for those people.

When I first started watching, I was really surprised at the production quality. Usually when you go searching for one of these ""underground"" disturbing movies the production value is usually what I would call ""B-Movie"" quality. This movie is not however. It is extremely high quality.

The music. This was by FAR my favorite part of the movie. The music was expertly chosen to create an un-nerving atmosphere through the entire movie. But the music's biggest role was to create that mood up through the slower beginning of the movie till around mid-way through. But honestly, the music really does rock, completely sets that mood.

So now, let's get down to the nuts and bolts. I am not going to talk about the plot or story of the movie. If you want that, google it! I am here just to provide some info. I have heard A LOT about this movie. And being an avid horror/thriller/B-movie fan for a while. I've seen so much of the good, bad and ugly. This is certainly an interesting one. I did my homework on it. Reading reviews, checking websites, etc..... And I wasn't sure what to expect when I finally watched it. Some reviewers were saying thinks like, 'I want to punch the director', 'I couldn't finish the movie', 'It scarred me for life', and much of the like. Now this is where I might get some heat. Don't get me wrong in any way shape or form, this movie has some massively disturbing content. But.... It's a movie. It's not real. The topics, special effects, and content are all disturbing and do push the limit. But it really was just a movie. Some parts were even chuckle worthy. Maybe I'm just a grizzled veteran of horror films, but for me this movie was as disturbing as Saving Private Ryan IMO. Sorry, to burst any bubbles here, but if you are a horror afficionado you might not find this as depraved as so many reviewers are stating. It is most certainly worth a watch as I think it is a very interesting movie with some excellent music and effects. I wouldn't really recommend this for the squimish or easily offended, but for someone who is up for the challenge and has a few horror films under their belts. Go for it.

The movie pushes the envelope in it's effects, music and certainly it's controversial content. IMO though, it is just that. A controversial movie that provides an interesting evening of entertainment for the few sick individuals watching it, myself included. But in the end, it's just a movie.",1348790400,7,2561,4.524838012958964
4251827,5,B0042L0P1C,"Let me start this review by saying that you have to go into this movie with an open mind.  You probably don't want to expect a horror film, for starters.  It is horrific but not a horror film, necessarily.
Review is for the unrated 104 minute film.  I agree with the other poster about the odd packaging.  I opened the box and was like what the...it's a cardboard flat with a slimline CD jewel case intended to look like a bootleg or some kind of snuff film.
This is a study in sociopolitical / economical strife in Serbia disguised as a violent, compelling, often times disgusting film.  If you take this film ""literally"", it could scar you for life.  I `get' the implications and understand them.  I believe this is a brilliant film.  You should watch this by yourself, for sure.  The story line / premise is interesting enough to compel you to watch the film through the end.  Synopsis:  Milos is a retired porn actor looking to support his family and takes a job sight unseen; signs a contract and basically signs away his life.  His morality starts to falter from the inception of the project but he is led to persevere Even against his will).  This is a story about greed, survival, perversion, sickness and how all of these things play into moral fiber.  There are scenes in this film that are abhorrent and sickening but are filmed with conviction skillfully and artfully.  Things are implied rather than, thankfully, shown.  Take my review for what it's worth, but this makes Hostel look like a school project.",1348012800,7,1519,4.611940298507463

This film is so vile netflix took it off its service. Having said that I must say if you are a fan of horror/porn this is for you. It was as disturbing as it was disgusting but I couldn't stop watching. When it was over I felt what the hell did I just see and how could someone make this. The only thing I didn't like was that it was subtitled but don't let that stop you from buying what is probably the sickest film ever made",1347408000,3,578,4.169642857142857
4251829,5,B0042L0P1C,"I recently found out that a new ""uncut"" version of this sick, twisted, and totally brilliant film had been released.  There have been a few ""Uncut"" versions of this film on DVD and all of those versions have, in fact, been cut heavily... despite the releases being named ""A Serbian Film - (Uncut)"". But when I saw that the running time on this new version was 104 minutes, I decided to roll the dice and ordered it so that I could finally own a decent copy, and for all intents and purposes, this new version is the best one available so far.  Here's what you should know:

1.)  The film is uncut. That's the main point.... The official release date on the one I ordered was May of 2012, and THAT'S the one you need to buy if you want the truly uncut version of this disturbing film.

2.) If you do order this new version, the film will satisfy you (provided that you are a fan...), but you WILL be disappointed with the packaging.  I didn't read anything about the packaging before I bought it, and was certainly skeptical when the DVD arrived in a slimline CD jewel case, attached to a DVD-sized piece of cardboard.... When I say ""DVD-sized"", I mean the horizontal and vertical measurements, NOT the width, which is about half the width of a normal DVD case, made from a cut piece of cardboard.... seriously.  The picture on Amazon looks like a normal type of cover if you just glance at it from a distance, but the only art to be found in the packaging is a typical plot description, like the backside of a DVD cover. But the plot description is in fact smaller than a DVD cover, and is merely pasted onto one side of the cardboard cutout. The packaging has all the makings of a bootleg, BUT, at this point, I'm happy to finally have an uncut version on official DVD media.

3.) Despite the ""bootleg-type packaging"", the quality of the film print is impeccable. Quality of the DVD itself is totally good, so don't worry about that.

4.) This version of the film is uncut, but the DVD has NO special features whatsoever.  You can obtain a digital copy, but you must have or set-up a FlixFling account, then you enter the promo code in the DVD package during the checkout process, and you do NOT have to enter credit card information.

5.) I do not understand why Amazon hasn't split the reviews of the various versions of this film into separate review pages.... If ever separate review pages were needed, it would be for fans of this film... so I specifically urge you to buy the same version that I did... the release date of the DVD was in May of 2012.

6.) If you have not seen this movie, you need to read some things about it or ask a friend who has seen it to describe some of the content contained in the film.  Because, quite frankly, this is probably the most twisted, sick, messed-up (can't use curse words here on Amazon, but I mean, MESSED UP with an ""F"" word in the place of ""Messed"") and disturbing film ever made.... The only two films that I've ever seen that rival the graphically sadistic and disturbing content of this film would be ""Salo: 120 Days of Sodom"" or ""Human Centipede 2""...Maybe ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Martyrs"", but I digress. In other words, if you are easily and deeply affected by sadistic, offensive, sick, nasty, vulgar and disturbingly shocking films in a major way, you NEED to read about this film before watching it... Then again, I could provide SOME brief insight with no spoilers, which is key if you are going to enjoy to the film. A shocking film can't shock if you can't be surprised by the shocking parts. So, without much detail, this film contains every kind of depravity that has ever been conceived by humankind when it comes to sex. It's not just explicit sex that you might catch in ""Boogie Nights"" or ""American Psycho"" or some films like those. The plot centers around pornography, and the film in its uncut form pretty much IS a porno film. Quite literally from the opening scene till the end. So much explicit sex is in this film that that fact alone will make some people call it ""garbage"". But, it's not just pornographic sex we're talking about here. Total graphic nudity. The most extreme rape scenes you will ever see. In many scenes, children play a key part in the FILMING of the pornography. We also have LOADS of gruesome violence that goes more over the top that any film I've seen, MAYBE other than ""Human Centipede II"". Maybe. But, this violence will affect your brain more than your stomach. In short, this film should probably not even be viewed by anyone under the age of 25. FOR GOD'S SAKES, DON'T LET THIS FILM FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CHILD. I think it would be considered by the police to be ""contributing to the delinquency of a minor."" Speaking of delinquency to minors, the kids in this film witness sex, violence, drugs, and yes, pornography. That's as far as I'll go, but believe me, words can't really describe the explicitness of the content of this film. As close to a pornographic snuff film that you'll ever see. Only this film actually has production values. The film does however have sociopolitical undertones about life in Serbia. This will not be easy to see for 1st time viewers. You may think I'm nuts if you watch this film after reading my statement there. But, it's true upon subsequent viewings. There IS subtext, but the film is dominated by the shock value.

7.)  Despite the bootleg-type packaging and complete lack of special features, I am totally satisfied with this purchase. I'm a gore-hound sometimes in my horror film tastes, and I've never understood why this film was so hard to distribute in ""uncut"" format when films like Human Centipede 1 & 2 are sold in Target and everywhere else.  Without the scenes that were chopped in earlier releases of the film on home media, the film loses SOME of it's shock value, but either way, it's still pretty darn disturbing.  For my money, if you are going to enjoy a film like this, then the Uncut version released in May of 2012 is the way to go if you like this film.

8.) Enjoy! It's just a movie.... most people will hate it, some will love it, but the film is one that you can't ""unwatch"" even if you only view it once.  But, my advice, grow a pair and have the moxie to take the whole horrific film in, then you'll have an experience seared into your memory for life, for better or worse.

9.) Please give me a ""helpful"" vote if this review was informative.  I'm no professional, but Amazon reviews are an occasional hobby of mine, so it's kinda fun racking up some ""thumbs up"" type of votes. What can I say? I'm a dork obviously, but in my defense I don't play video games or Facebook games often, if ever, due to my workload. Like I said, this is a part-time hobby of mine. I may not be a professional, but I do really try to only help with items that I am very familiar with and like personally.

A Serbian Film - Uncut, finally.... the entire 104 minutes. It's only version to watch if you're going to watch it.  Get sick and twisted one night, and brace yourself for a very shocking and disturbing, yet brilliant film.  Peace.

P.S. - I just read a really nice review that you should check out as well here on Amazon for this film.

Its a descent into sexual deviance of the worst kind. There is some gore but nothing of shock value. The only thing shocking to me is the amount of people that enjoyed this film. There are a few scenes which were done purely to appall the audience but backfired as I don't find (SPOILER!!!) sexual acts with children and infants entertainment...just disgusting and without any type of artistic value. This movie had potential but in an effort to create an intense never before seen work of art they chucked out all vision and just went for pure depravity. Doesn't take creativity to think that up,just lack of! Save your money if you're looking for horror.

4251833,4,B0042L0P1C,"It's hard to know what to say about this.

Quite what the writer and director wanted to achieve in presenting this is not clear. To sell it as ""A Serbian Film"" as if to say- this is what this country is like, or feels like to live in, is a chilling and sobering thought indeed. I certainly won't be holidaying there anytime soon.

The story is of a down on his luck porn actor, given a last chance opportunity to make big money for his family in a too tempting to refuse offer.
What he doesn't realise is the price to be paid in sacrificing his morals, and all that he holds dear, to satisfy a totally insane director, who believes the art/pornographic film he is making will be the ultimate statement to show what real life is all about.
Drugged and fuelled up high on viagra and cocaine, he is forced to perform grotesque acts of sex and violence, involving murder, incest,and all manner of degradation, all filmed by the director and his henchmen.
He finally cracks completely when his own family are brought into the filming, and the climax builds to an orgy of revolting murder and mutilation.

So, this is strong stuff indeed, and not for the easily offended.
I'm not sure what kind of audience would say they ""enjoyed~ this film.
 It is too well made, acted and presented to be dismissed as pure exploitation or simple ""video nasty"" material, so the usual gore lovers will probably be put off by the slow pace and the sub-titled dialogue to stick with it. Lovers of art films will probably just be revolted. The average cinema goer will probably be bewildered. So who it is aimed at, I don't know.

That said, if you stick with it to the end, you will no doubt be devastated, probably feel dirty and ashamed, and certainly have a sense of despair that makes you wonder how sick the world can be sometimes. It is more of an endurance test than a film, to see who can stay the course. I doubt that anyone could say they felt enlightened after watching it, but you have to admire the bravery of the team that put it together, knowing how controversial it would be.

Obviously this is cut in most countries, or banned outright in some. It is a tasteless film, but I think if you are going to bother to see it, you need to see it full strength for the real gut punch effect.

This dvd is a bare bones affair, deliberately packaged to look down-market and sleazy. The DVD comes in a bloodied effect cheap plastic jewel case, glued to a piece of cardboard, with a sticker on the back giving a brief synopsis and credits. It looks like an under the counter porno, which I suppose to a certain extent, it is.",1343779200,10,2606,4.394190871369295

A Serbian Film is one of those movies you have to work yourself up to. If you've seen the Saw movies, Faces of Death series or actual torture footage, you might be ready. If I had seen the EDITED version, I would have thought it was an interesting story, well-shot with a bizarre twist at the end. The problem with the UNCUT is that the scenes that remain are dynamite blasts in a world of gunfire. They not only steal the show, they misplace the peaks and draw away for the dramatic base of the film.

4251835,5,B0042L0P1C,"i picked up this uncut gem after watching a bootleg version(it was uncut as well) and deciding that, to me, it is the most brutal underground gore film since slaughtered vomit dolls.

i usually am a harsh critic on horror films and i must say, i don't have one single bad thing to say about this movie. it had a great, original plot, it was not a remake, it had a soundtrack that went well with the feel of the film, over the top gore and just brutal in general scenes, multiple twists near the ending, and touched on topics that are deemed taboo by even the most jaded gore hounds.

i don't want to give away too much, for the first time watching this without really knowing whats around the corner is priceless. but one of the main topics that caused all the controversy had already been done in the last in the vomit gore trilogy called, slow torture puke chamber(which i had already watched). so, i went into watching this movie, not focused on the very few scenes that closed minded viewers couldn't handle, but i was able to absorb this film for what it is. which to me is just a great exploitation movie. i felt that all the scenes that caused up roars all over were completely justified by the film's brutal story. i don't think the director did these scenes on purpose or to shock rock us, or to get his film talked about. i think this director just had a wonderfully, over the top story and wasn't about to compromise his vision just for people that feel that its immoral. if you have issues with the subjects dealt with in a serbian film(which most of you will), just don't watch it. stick to friday the 13th's and such.

for the gore hounds, and fans that enjoy degrading,filthy,perverted, sleaze cinema, watch this at all costs(avoid the cut version). the idea to cut this film on just a few scenes is ridiculous. any one that can handle the cut version, can handle the extra few mins. for those that have watched this, i have 3 words for you,

I'm not advocating violence for violence's sake, but when done artistically it can be sort of...well, I don't think that I MEAN beautiful; maybe just that it fits and I'd rather take a full shot than just a taste.

Don't get me wrong, a film doesn't NEED graphic violence to be good. The newer BATMAN films are bloodless, but very good. But in those movies the violence is often comical; no one needs SPIDERMAN to have a version with ""ultraviolence."" But those movies are made to watch casually. Anytime.

I personally thought it was a 5 star movie BUT there's one down side to this ""uncut"" version for which I deducted 1 star. You know those really thin DVD cases? Well this version comes in that case glued to a thin cardboard with the label stickered to the other side. I mean, I understand their aim for the packaging but I'm sure most have prefurred a regular one comapared to this cheap one.

But don't let that make you buy the ""cut"" version which is only about 40 seconds shorter because those momemts ""really"" count and makes the difference.

This really messed me up! That is how gross it is. Repulsive is too mild of a word for this trash. I have never felt so dirty, filthy, and bummed out from a movie before.

The other one is a cut version by about 30+ seconds. But those are valuable seconds; if cut you can hardly tell what is going on. So DO NOT buy the cut version.

Yes, the sickest movie ever made --- 'A Serbian Film', has finally been released in the U.S. completely uncut and uncensored for the first time. And it's not for the novice. Look, I don't care if you've seen 'I Spit on Your Grave' and 'Last House on the Left' a hundred times each. They're Disney films compared to this puppy. This is it. This is as far as you can go in a film. The limits have been stretched to the max. Director Srdan Spasojevic takes you on a ride to hell you won't ever forget even though you might want to.

Banned in Norway, Spain, and Australia --- 'A Serbian Film' is, in actuality, a parody of modern politically correct films made in Serbia which are financially supported by foreign funds. Yup, underneath the layer of perverted ultraviolence is a powerful political message. Unfortunately, for some people, the disturbing nature of the movie won't allow them to see it. The story? All I'll say is it revolves around a retired porn actor accepting one last 'job' that turns out to be an utter nightmare.

4251843,3,B0042L0P1C,"I watched this movie last night after hearing all the hype and reading 1 star review after 1 star review. Sure, the core message parallels that of ""Natural Born Killers"": Western society/culture is destroying itself via the media & mass entertainment outlets. Thing is, the shocks are pretty much the only reason to watch it because the quality of everything but the prop, make-up, & art departments suffers due to a laughable script, so-so acting, a conventional music score & sound by the sound department (a few of the ""gross-out"" sounds worked though), and the lighting department did a so-so job. I'm a film buff/elitist, whatever you want to call it; I notice flaws and they bug me--that's just my taste & opinion.

I know lots of people go for these types of horror flicks that are more concerned with the shock factor than the little things that add up to a well-made film; to each her/his own. Funny thing is, after the 1st few shocks I became desensitized towards the barrage of sickness, enough so that I began to find the film funny, like a blacker-than-black black comedy. The edge of realism they tried for turned into surrealism. That surrealistic feel surrounding the gore works against what (I believe)was the film-maker's goal: to have the movie as a whole be like a slice-of-life gone terribly wrong. Instead of making me feel genuine emotion towards the characters and their situations, that surrealistic edge gave me enough SAFE distance from them that I could step back from what I was seeing and think critically. If they could have found ways to remove that safety blanket between the gore scenes, so that I was tethered to the story enough to be unable to step back for a breather, I would've been deeply repulsed for the movies full duration instead of chuckling and shaking my head.

The film-makers were obviously attempting to create a meaningful, realistic film with an important message, but due to the over-all lack of professionalism (exceptions to all involved in the amazing work with the gore)the movie goes from being a potentially important and artistic statement to falling flat as another typical shock flick that, while upping the ante on the limitations of pervasive gore, stays grounded as just another movie in the Netflix ""Horror"" genre because it, surprisingly enough, didn't take technical chances in how it was made to match the chances it took with the limits of gore. The script could've been helped greatly by running it through maybe 3-4 more drafts.

All-in-all, ""A Serbian Film"" should be called ""A Serbian Movie"" or ""A Serbian Horror Flick"", because, unfortunately, those involved in its creation obviously placed all of the emphasis of their talents on the shock factor of the gore alone, versus putting in the time and effort to make the other aspects of the film stand tall with the blood & guts. A tripod falls down every time if it only has one leg fully telescoped. HOWEVER--if you get past the technical misfirings (if that sort of thing even bothers you at all)you'll probably appreciate this movie for the risks the people involved took (everybody whose name is attached to this movie will find their reputations forever changed, for better or worse);or, like me, you'll end up enjoying it as something outlandishly gross to watch a few times (don't see myself watching it more than once more on my own--too many better films to digest),or a ""shock token"" to show friends or bring to parties to witness the certain gross-out reactions.

4251845,5,B0042L0P1C,"A Serbian Film  tells the terrible story of a retired adult film actor named Milos who gets far more than he bargained for when he accepts what he is led to believe is the role of a lifetime. His intentions are valiant. He needs the money so that he can leave the troubled country of Serbia and start a new life with his attractive and frisky, yet intelligent wife and his young son who looks to have Gypsy heritage and is unbelievably cute. His life isn't as good as it could be. Milos is beginning to struggle with making ends meet, and his brother, who is in law enforcement, hates him because he's attracted to his wife. He accepts the job based on the intriguing premise of what film director Vukmir tells him as well as a former colleague. It's a reality based pornographic art film in which Milos is supposed to instead act off of the reality of the situations he's brought into. He is not supposed to be told about what the script entails. Things begin to get a little too weird when the reality begins to incorporate some sort of strange plot involving children in an orphanage. Disturbed, Milos discusses with his wife what backing out of the film would entail, financially, but eventually even she agrees that it's for the best. He tells Vukmir that he's backing out of the project and has no interest in continuing in filming. Immediately following his declining of the role, however, his life becomes a living nightmare.

In terms of the most disturbing films I've seen, A Serbian Film is certainly one of the nastiest. The only films I feel that top it are Come and See(the Russian World War II film about the young boy who goes insane during the 1943 Nazi Germany takeover)and Threads(the BBC mockumentary about Nuclear war). Films that disturbed me similarly would be Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father (the documentary about a child being raised by his father's supposed murderer), Combat Shock (the Troma produced, Buddy Giovinazzo low-budget picture about the deranged Vietnam war veteran), A Clockwork Orange (the 1971 Stanley Kubrick science fiction picture) Possession (the 1981 Andrzej Zulawski horror film with Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill), Dancer in the Dark (the Lars Von Trier/Bjork musical), The War Zone (the incest themed film that Tim Roth directed), Schindler's List (yes, the Steven Spielberg one, it did deeply disturb me), Chan-Wook Park's Oldboy (the revenge picture) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (the Tobe Hooper 70s film that needs no introduction). This is a deeply troubling film in many ways and it ultimately left me feeling a great sadness and frustration. There was not a single positive moment in this film that could really make up for the truly ghastly, cruel acts that are committed against Milos and his family. Part of what makes this film so emotional and devastating is the heavy (and I do mean HEAVY) exposition that makes up the entire first hour of the film. We totally see the family that Milos has and we, as the audience, cannot help but admire how far he has come. This is one of the few films I have seen in recent memory that has a heavy plot, yet has a protagonist who takes his wife's feelings 100% seriously and is, all things considered, an ideal husband overall. He and his family may be on the verge of being poverty stricken, but they have as normal a life as a family like that can possibly have. The wife is a non-judgmental, unassuming, mostly pleasant person who is completely faithful to Milos and doesn't fret at the fact that his profession of choice is what he is most known for in other circles. The son is as gentle-natured as a boy like that can be and, aside from viewing one of his father's films in the opening of the film, is totally normal and healthy and is growing up fast.

Then there's the brother of Milos, whom we only meet a few times and each time he seems like a mostly sleazy, jealous, and unpleasant man. It's no question that his intentions are impure, and that's probably one of the most overtly obvious things about this picture, though it never takes away too much from the gravity of the situations of this film. He is also a police officer, but he seems most distracted by Milos and his wife in particular. He has an unhealthy fascination with his family, and this fact is established early on. At first I was a little put off by his characters antics being one of the key elements early in in the film, but I eventually concluded that it was better for this film to elude to this fact sooner rather than later.. Vukmir seems most suspicious out of everyone, but doesn't seem too obviously crazy, which I suppose may seem jolting for some viewers. He seems more eccentric, but that's true of a lot of filmmakers. I think the fact that this man is eccentric, yet intelligent and thoughtful may be quite scary for many mainstream viewers, who tend to like their villains insane, loud, and obvious. Vukmir may be insane and loud, but obvious would be the last word I would use to describe his overall character. The film takes it's time showing all these characters as fully rounded people who all have their little personality traits and their own agendas. That's why, when things take a turn for the worse, the audience can't help but be jolted and have a strong reaction. Not only do we see these people as genuine characters, but we also jump to our own conclusions about what could happen to them so that we begin to dread when the film turns ugly. Most people who watch this film will likely know about what happens and how notorious the film is for being dark and disturbing. The thing that most people don't know is how, and that's how emotional and devastating the film truly is.

Of course anyone could find films that have horrible and horrendous acts in it, but my question would be how hard do those acts affect the viewer? I ask because I highly doubt that the effects are as devastating as the acts depicted in this. To say the least, this is not a film for the faint-hearted, the easily offended, the pregnant, or for people who have heart conditions. This is one of the only horror films in which you nay need to know about the most notorious scene in the film beforehand before watching because once you know the most notorious scene, you may not want to watch it anymore. Without spoiling anything, one thing I will say is that it is not as graphic and explicit as you probably will picture in your mind when you read about it or hear about it, but what makes the scene (and, really, most of the scenes in this entire film) so horrifying are the sound effects and the editing. The actual onscreen content is mostly a lot of smoke and mirrors, and when some explicit and, some would say, pornographic does occur on screen, it's usually too brief for anyone to really fully take in completely. I think this is a good time to say that the most infamous scene in the picture wasn't even the most disturbing part of the film for me. Take that as you will, as a blessing or as a serious warning that you should never even consider watching A Serbian Film.

Part of what also makes this film effective has to do with how beautifully made it is. With a film of this nature, which is very politically incorrect, over-the-top, and abrasive in it's depraved imagination, it's highly unorthodox that anyone would ever put in so much money and professional talent, and yet that's what has happened here. The film is remarkably well shot and the editing is as fast and as effective as anything you'd find in a horror film. The soundtrack is chilling, effective, and simple. The film has a very deep, gritty, loud techno score that truly enhances the horror and the circumstances of the characters. These elements wouldn't normally add so much to this film, but the fact of the matter is this. A Serbian Film was independently financed. If this much care and attention to detail can be made to this kind of  film with such a low budget, there really shouldn't be any more excuses, in this day and age, for people to cut so many unnecessary cinematic corners. In terms of acting, the performances are absolutely outstanding. Srdjan Todorovic and Sergej Trifunovic(the actors who played Milos and Vukmir) I learn, are two of the most famous and highly acclaimed Serbian actors of the last decade, and their performances are deeply heartfelt. Again, I find this shocking. The fact that two respected actors would act in a film like this really goes to show you the truly professional approach taken with this material. At the same time, it makes me a little sad. If a popular actor in America chose to be in a film with material like this, their career would likely be ruined. Yet these two men are continuing to get roles and are still acting, and now that this film is getting recognition in the states I'm sure they'll get plenty more. Of course this film is probably likely to be banned in Serbia, as well as in a few other places, so I suppose their acclaim may come at some sort of price. Regardless, as far as Serbian film goes, A Serbian Film is as effective as any other.

As a horror film it works wonderfully due to the suspense of the picture. It has a more classical way of plot development and depicting how it all comes together. At times, it feels very modern noir-esque in the same way that the Joseph Gordon Levitt film Brick did. A good chunk of the film is told in hyper real flashback, and so the audience spends a good amount of time wondering what the hell is going on and fearing the worst. Those are the most suspenseful scenes in the film. I like when a film can build so much dread in such a short period of time, and that's one of the things I admired the most about this picture. I like how this film shows events. I like how the film also shows perspective when it comes to what happens. I think one of the more effective parts of this film comes toward the end of the picture when it suddenly dawns on us that this story is not going to have the usual horror film ending. I wouldn't even call this a horror film really if it weren't for the fact that it is scary. It's a horror film in the same way that a film like Brian De Palma's Blow-Out or Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan could be considered horror films even though they certainly aren't. I cannot really complain, however, about whatever elements of genre this film may exhibit, because A Serbian Film breaks more taboos than most films manage to do in the span of two hours, and it does it without sacrificing an ounce of coherency. I'm of the firm belief that all taboos need to be destroyed as soon as possible, and the major one this one breaks is in it's depiction of the adult film industry itself. This film treats the porn film industry incredibly fairly, by depicting it as just another profession just like any other, and by showing the main protagonist, a hardcore porn actor, as being nothing more than just a regular guy who has a normal set of morals and emotions and who happens to just know some very bad people. That's a fact that I feel this film deserves to be recognized for.

This film's way of depicting tragedy is really interesting, because it relies more on genuine personal torment and frustration in order to allow the audience to be emotionally involved in the situation that Milos has undergone and is still working through. It's a tricky technique, but somehow it works. It especially works when the film finally makes it's biggest revelation, which is just terrible and deeply heartbreaking, and then the horror doesn't stop there. To quote one early review that I read before I saw the film, ""penises are inserted into things that they were never meant to ever enter into."" It's true. What works the most about all this, however, is how unabashed and how bizarre and off-the-wall the nature of reality becomes as the film progresses. The film isn't afraid to be even the slightest bit surreal, and one thing I love about a lot of art is a healthy dose of surrealism. The film isn't also afraid to be darkly humorous. Without spoiling anything, there is a scene in this film in which a man takes his own dick hostage at knife point. Nobody could ever take a film that contains such a ridiculous idea completely seriously, and so viewers should certainly not be afraid to find this film entertaining. The film is entertaining in the same way that the hammer scene at the end of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is entertaining. It's perversely entertaining. Director Srdjan Spasojevic creates such a chaotic world that we get involved in, and we, the audience, are led to believe that anything horrible and depraved could happen at any moment and there will be no limits. It's true too, because there aren't any real limits. I mean yes it is horrible, but at the same time the film manages to in fact tell a story and it manages to be scary and effective as a horror film. That's what amazes most about this picture. A Serbian Film is as gory, and disturbing, and as intense as it gets, but none of it ever feels the least bit gratuitous, even if the imagery can be quite jarring and unsettling at times.

Part of me also wants to pay more attention to the political aspects of the film, which come across as more metaphorical at times although they are undeniably still there, despite whatever the naysayers say. This film is more a picture dealing with a collective rage that is garnered from the citizens of the country of Serbia that comes from many years of war atrocities, political corruption, dishonesty, and censorship that befallen Serbia in the last two decades. The acts that are depicted in this film, obviously, are nothing compared to the terrible things going on there in war-torn areas, and I highly doubt any comparison was intended. The idea of soldiers being forced to basically become animals in order to serve their government is a lot more disturbing in itself than what's going on in this film. This film's intention is not to show all that and try to compete with ghastly imagery on it's own, but instead to emulate the same feelings of living in a war torn environment in which the local business and people, so devastated by the atrocities, have crumbled. As the director described, he's taken a profession, in this film being the adult film actor, and has found a way to have it so that the character, so to speak, is raped in multiple ways. In this regard, I think the film works wonders, though I would recommend forgetting all of that if you're going to take the film on an emotional level. Essentially it's kind of like what Eli Roth tried to do with Hostel, though with mixed results. There's nothing wrong with making a horror film, and in a lot of ways Hostel is a much more violent film than A Serbian Film. This is not the kind of horror film that is all blood and guts and sex. This is more the kind of horror film that is like Pasolini's Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom, Von Trier's Antichrist, or Lyne's Jacob's Ladder. Essentially it's a horror film that does a lot more than just horrifies. It's a tragedy that you can't help but have a strong reaction to. It's really no different than Chan-Wook Park's Oldboy, which to me is an equally powerful and disturbing film. My reaction to this film is one of tremendous sadness and anger. Anger at the filmmakers for showing me these things that I don't want to see, and sadness for myself for watching this. Wes Craven did the exact same thing with Last House on the Left. His film was his reaction to the Vietnam war. Films like this are simply reactions to the violence and depravity of the world around us and nothing more. It's difficult to put into words how one would feel, for example, if someone opened up a newspaper and read about a girl getting kidnapped, raped, murdered, and dissolved in acid. It's impossible to find the right words to describe how sad one would feel, and there is nothing wrong with making a film that is meant to emulate those feelings for the average viewer. A Serbian Film is primarily, however, an attack on censorship and political correctness. In a time in which many films are banned in different countries for jokes against the handicapped, for racial humor, and for satiric attacks against political figures, one of this film's major intentions is to destroy taboos, which to me is an important thing. Today, Mel Brooks would never be allowed to make Blazing Saddles without controversy blowing up in his face. I think that taboos are holding the human race back, and in a way it is very refreshing to see a film that is so gleeful in it's destruction of forbidden imagery and ideas.

The big question for me would be, should I recommend it? On one hand, this film angered me and made me feel terrible for poor Milos and his wife and child and the horrible things that they all go through. On the other hand, this film, in terms of transgressive cinema with pictures such as Ex Drummer, Irreversible, Inside, and Martyrs, A Serbian Film is one of the best of it's kind. It's one of the most effective films I've seen in years as well as one of the scariest. It's disheartening, frustrating, and cruel. One thing I can definitely say though is that it's not gratuitous. Brutal? Definitely. Exploitative and over-the-top? Maybe a little, if you want to get really into it. Horrifying? Yes. It's beautifully made, it's heartbreakingly tragic, it's terribly realistic, it's not entirely humorless (some of the violence seems straight out of a Troma picture), and it's one of the most effective and well made films as well as one of the most disturbing. The big question is, does it work? Yes, it works. It works a little too well one could say, but it works. So do I fault it for working? No, I praise it. I wouldn't recommend to everyone, but I'm glad that films like this can still be made and I'm glad that filmmakers have the guts to go all the way with their vision. Srdjan Spasojevic was clearly inspired by the works of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma, David Cronenberg, and William Friedkin. This is Srdjan Spasojevic's first film, and I think a lot of Hollywood horror filmmakers could learn a thing or two from his style and his fearless approach to this rather difficult material. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, and I don't regret watching it for even a second. If a film can get to me this strongly, it has certainly done something right.",1335916800,31,18457,4.5549533273110505

I really don't have much to say about the movie, except that it (shockingly!) isn't really shocking, provocative, or groundbreaking in any way.  The whole film is just.. well... it's really not very good.  It's an odd combination of hard-core porn, ""torture porn"", and recovered memory thriller somewhat in the vein of ""Memento"".  If you want to see lots of fevered thrusting, engorged d***s, and a little bit of family suicide mixed in, go for it.  If you're actually in the mood for a provocative film that is unsettlingly violent yet also has a deeper message, go for Martyrs.

4251848,4,B0042L0P1C,"Absolutely horrifying and brutal, but also has something important to say beyond what is seen on the surface. I think there will be different interpretations of this movie's message for different people, but it's still there if you can get past the shock of what you're seeing. When people are this angered and outraged by a movie, that is not real, how is it possible that we can ever truly comprehend and understand the atrocities that are committed against our fellow human beings on a daily basis- any age, any race, any gender, social status, etc. We can't. It's easier for us to write scathing reviews of a movie like this,calling it foul and disgusting and trying to have it banned, than actually stopping to think about the real violence that's going on in this world and being shocked and appalled by that instead.

The only thing about the movie that is 'negative', of course, is how extreme the violence gets, because a majority of people will focus on that instead of the message of it, but I think it HAD to be like that, how else could the director really have gotten anyone's attention? It's not violence for violence's sake, as other reviewers have said. I personally think it's trying to be a bit of a wake up call. We've all become so desensitized by violence that things that should shock us don't. The only way to really get anyone's attention in this manner is to put it right in front of them and say ""You want violence? I'll show you what REAL violence is like-here it is. Not pretty, is it?""

Aside from the social commentary, this is actually a well directed and well acted movie. You care about Milos and what is going to happen to him and his family, and you feel the panic and terror he does as things get progressively worse. Also, the music was perfect, it built up right along with the movie. Would I ever watch this again? No. This is a movie to be watched once, and remembered forever.",1333756800,5,1918,4.508620689655173

The scenes that are cut in this movie are only two and they are not really cut, they are just altered so you can't see the controversial, shocking stuff.

This movie IS NOT for the tame or meek. It takes a hard heart not to feel outrage and sorrow for the victims of this film. I give this film 5 stars for the fact that it is a very well done movie.

The viewer finds out what happens to Milos through a series of flashbacks and film he finds.  I understand it is suppose to be a political statement but it also makes a good antidrug film.  Things went downhill for Milos when the drug was injected into him.  The film does have some scenes that will make people wince.  It didn't phase us because we already knew what to expect and we have seen quite a bit of ""disturbing"" imagery.  Also, it is just a movie and it has a way of drawing in the viewer.

4251870,5,B0042L0P1C,"I just watched A Serbian Film. I can't recommend everyone see it - it is hard to watch, sick and twisted, and as absolutely brilliant as  Gaspar No's Irreversible.

This movie (covered in previous reviews) has a story, and a damned good one - I expected to see a flick that was one gross-out after another, and while there are some truly horrific scenes, the story is constructed beautifully and does a great job of showing how the main character falls so far.

In an odd way it reminded me of Boogie Nights - a movie that deals with adult subject matter in an adult way, starts out almost light-hearted, and then takes a dark turn. Of course the dark turns in this movie are very dark indeed.

I'm amazed how many prudes flipped out over the graphic nature of this film when all the sex is simulated. There are 'art house' films that have gotten rave reviews and have actual hardcore scenes and not much story beyond the sex. And as for those who complained about the film's sexualization of children, have any of those people watched any music videos by young female performers lately? Turning young teens into harlots is a booming cash business.

People will watch said art house movies and enjoy them. People will watch movies like Saw and enjoy them. For some reason people get upset when you mix the two together. Let's face it, most of the violent scenes in this film are cartoonishly over the top, and any scenes involving children are implied or faked. Brook Shields appeared nude in Pretty Baby when she was 12 freaking years old and the critics LOVED it. Nothing like that is seen in A Serbian Film.

As for this movie presenting sickening scenes, as I said, it is all fake, it's a MOVIE. The REAL thing is happening every day in every town, all you have to do is turn on the news to see that. You want to complain about something, how about fixing the foster care system where real horrors happen all the time?

The climactic castration scene from Hostel 2 is available for everyone, including children, to view on Youtube. It is THE most realistically graphic violent scene I've ever seen in a movie, and it is on Youtube, uncensored. Where is the outrage over THAT? In fact, the violent scenes in the Hostel flicks are far more grotesque than anything seen in A Serbian Film. Yet people rage against this movie that has a great story, wrenching scenes, a fantastic cast, and brilliant cinematography, and it's a film structured so pictures tell most of the tale and the subtitles are unobtrusive.

4251871,1,B0042L0P1C,"Simply titled A Serbian Film, the movie explores themes of violence and sexual depravity in ways you may never have seen before on film. The story follows a struggling male porn star named Milos who takes on one last gig, a supposed pornographic ""art film,"" for a fat paycheck and the chance to break away from the industry completely. Once filming begins, however, Milos gradually realizes it's not quite what he thought, and his life devolves into a hellish and sadistic nightmare for him and his family. A Serbian Film generated much controversy, due to its disturbingly graphic depiction of rape, pedophilia, and necrophilia, earning nationwide bans in countries like Spain, Germany, and Australia, and I was hard-pressed to disagree.

Take your chances, but beware; this is most certainly not for the faint of heart.",1320710400,11,999,4.9880239520958085

I have no one to blame but myself for buying this. The part that makes me upset is the part that implicates the main character is drugged up and unknowingly sodomizing his own young son. It doesn't show the boys face or body, a blanket is thrown over the body, but still,.. Its one thing when he was doing this to his wife but THIS was the final straw. I am surprised someone hasn't brought the director up on legal charges. Perhaps because it was filmed overseas. I have to admit I am planning on throwing this monster in the trash barrel after breaking the disc in half. Sorry folks I am not trying to come off mean but this is too much.

The transfer to Blu-ray is great.  However, the film itself is muddled with the two missing key scenes.  If you are looking for the complete uncut film - this is not it.",1320192000,6,316,4.2
4251874,3,B0042L0P1C,"I heard about this film while standing in line at Human Centipede II. During those conversations, people were claiming how horrible it was. Now, without giving too much away anybody that knows a bit about this film already knows of the awful, vile subject matter so I don't think I need to go into deep detail on any of that.

I will say this, there are some that are making this out to be a film that is so terrible that you throw up, need a shower, whatever....and I admit maybe I'm a bit jaded from YEARS worth of shock cinema...Cannibal Holocaust, Salo, Necromantik's, Aftermath, Singapore Sling, Taxidermia, HC...etc...BUT...although the film's subject matter is vile, it's in no way to the level of how people often claim it to be.

NOW...I'm fairly certain I saw an edited copy, it's the 103 minute version of the DVD that is offered for sale. I can tell where the edits take place, for sure 2 scenes in particular, maybe a third. Bewteen all three...at MOST there can only be seconds missing, I'd guess less than a minute total. And to be quite honest, I myself did not need those few seconds back in to get the point of every scene, I'm sure the missing footage is quite awful, but I can pretty well imagine what it was and really will not go out of my way to find an unedtited copy as I do not think it will change the film  to any degree for me as a viewer.

There is no doubt there are underlying political statements in the film and they are quite blatent when setting them up, I got it and I think most that are not so wrapped up in the degenerate sex related aspects will get it too.

The film is well written, well directed with great photography and excellent acting. The problem I had with the film was the totally fake male anatomy appendages, for whatever reason, they chose to utilize what looked like 14in appendages when a 7 or 8in one would have been more realistic. Some of the scenes with those things are absolutely absurd and laughable. It totally took away from the seriousness of the scenes...and who knows...maybe that's what the director was going for.

Some of the things in the film have been done before, the machete scene in particular was done to a very similar degree in Necromantik II and in Hatchet II in a slightly different way.

All in all the film is a pretty decent shock fest, but I just did not have the same reaction many claim to be having, now I admit that may be due to the edited scenes, but I highly doubt it. In relation to vile sexual horror I myself still found ""Irreversable"" to be worse IMHO.

Worth a look, but be leary if you are looking for the ultimate in gross out horror....for that I'd say take a look at Human Centipede II.",1320192000,13,2689,4.374749498997996

The Serbian Film is a great film.  It's not for everyone, but for those who like extreme cinema, chances are you will love it.

The reason I wanted to add my 2 cents is in regards to the infamous cut scenes.  This version is the same version released on Flixfling (which I rented online a while back).  There is only 30 seconds cut on this version spread over two scenes.  I also have seen the original workprint so have seen both versions.  While I agree it is unfortunate it was cut at all, the cuts are very minor and do not take away from the understanding of, or enjoyment of the movie.

This version is the most complete official release with english subs.  The UK version has 49 cuts that total to 4 minutes and the German version has a whopping 16 minutes cut out!  So we are fotunate only to have 30 seconds removed in the end.

Again, I have seen both versions and I bought this bluray.  Each buyer must make their own choice, but this issue has been a bit overblown IMO.",1320192000,6,1127,4.23943661971831

It is beautiful, funny, captivating, campy, terrifying, outrageous, pornographic, depressing, and hauntingly brilliant all at the same time. You will not be the same human being after you watch this. Your life, and outlook on it, will never be the same after viewing it. This is why I beg you to seek out the truly ""unrated"" version of this film. The Blu-Ray new release version, although visually amazing thanks to Blu-Ray (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), is what I would let my wife see. If you want the real effect of this film, search out the real uncut version first. It is the only way to fully appreciate the effect the filmmakers were trying to achieve.

If other reviews are trying to convince you that it was created for art, political or any other reasons then they are fooling themselves and being dishonest with you.  Plain and simple....If you want to watch a sick and dememnted film involving graphic violence, nudity, rape and child rape/pornography that you will not soon forget, then by all means knock yourself out but if you even think for a second that this is something you would rather not see then you should not watch.

Sure it may only be cut by 30+ seconds...but if you're going to release an unrated version of a film, there should be NO CUTS since it did not go through the ratings board. Incredibly disappointing that such a unique film is still censored in a country that touts FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION.

4251881,2,B0042L0P1C,"first off...this movie is in no way 103 minutes, it's rounded up.  Secondly i'm sure that a good portion of this flick was cut out for whatever reason. I have never watched the uncut version.  I didn't want a grainy bootleg, so shortly after i heard about this movie a while back I found out Invincible Pictures picked up the rights to it.  I was excited because they are also putting out a blu ray. I was super excited. Giddy like a school girl, but with all the giddiness i was sorely disappointed.

I was told that this movie would rip out my soul, put dirt on my hands that i couldn't scrub off...sadly I was disappointed. This film was cut so horribly to pieces that it lost all the power it had in the first place.

It's like watching Phantom of The Opera and having his mask ripped off and then just showing the woman screaming and not his face.  Or like watching the Usual Suspects and after Kevin Spacey leaves the room the movie ends.  If you really want a soul wrenching movie watch Requiem for a Dream or The Informers (not the best movie, but accomplished a lot in the soul wrenching department) or even better and I'm not a fan of bootlegs, get the real copy of this film on a torrent.  OH also the 2nd hit, my copy came with a free digital copy, I thought my final shot at redemption because you get to download it from Flix Fling.  To my knowledge this was the only way that you could see the uncut version ,legally, to my dismay they also changed it to the cut version which left an even more sour taste in my mouth.

The picture is great, the sound track isn't anything to write home to mom about, the acting was really quite good, also another punch in the face was no english dubbing. This all left me quite bitter, angry, and disappointed. Don't let this happen to you.

**Update**
For the record, I just watched the key scenes that, in my opinion, gave all the film the power of anything I have ever watched. I'm not sure if they would make sense or just shock you out of context, but because I knew the context that they were in, and just to see the film itself how it was meant to be, really made me want to throw up a little. My stomach kind of ached a bit. My theory was correct, the scenes made drove the point home, maybe more so than it needed to, but wow. I don't think I've reacted that way to a movie in ages.

4251884,1,B0042L0P1C,"Potential Spoiler Alert:  I will not give you the details of this movie as you can likely get the idea from the plot synopsis.  However, I do want to let all potential viewers know that the following were included in this film:  extremely graphic sex and violence including  pedophilia (in the worst imaginable way), incest, bestiality, torture, etc.  In fact, I'm unsure what vile part of the worst characteristics of humans were left out of this movie.

To provide background, I like horror books and films and did a search to find the best recent horror films.  I read a number of people mention that this movie was better than ""Martyrs"" (which I have not seen) which was listed on a number of people's top 10 list.  Let me emphasize that I do not believe this movie is a horror movie (think Paranormal Activity); rather it is horrific.  It was like a X-rated version of ""Hostel"" on crack.

A number of times throughout the movie, I caught myself wondering why I did not turn it off..as I have done this when movies bore me, toe the line on (my definition of) decency), etc.  I realized that this movie was so horrifying that I watched to see if there would be any shred of redemption.  I needed there to be some type of happiness or healthy resolution.  While I don't blame the film for ending the way it did (before the very last part...disgusting), I was deeply disturbed and saddened to discover there was no such redemption.

Rather than focus on the cinematic quality of the film, as I can not find any possible way to justify this genre of film, political statement or not, I can only focus on the emotional responses this movie invoked in me:  concern rising to disbelief, rising to shock, rising to horror, rising to feeling just a little bit sick.  This movie has been flashing in my mind the whole day and has affected me like no other movie I have ever seen in my life.  That was probably the directors' intent but I am left with wishing I had never watched it.  I am not a better or more informed person for seeing this movie and the fact that these various acts happen in real life has made me feel very, very exposed to the underside of humanity...a lesson I don't think we need to unwittingly learn.

Sergej Trifunovic is brilliant as well.

However the more you know about the politics behind this film the more you will understand why it is a great film and far less a horror film than maybe a satirical commentary on Serbia and the recent wars.  That still will not wipe clean the memories you will have after seeing this but they may help to answer the question of why someone would make a film like this.  Most if not all of the most disturbing films made throughout history have been political.  This one has many similarities with Salo in its debasements of humans.  Maybe it is the basis in history that makes a film like this so much more powerful than a film like Human Centipede which was based on a joke.  A Serbian Film is no joke.
However, for a true journey into hell, nothing I have seen to date beats Come and See...not a horror film in the least but nightmare inducing all the same.

4251889,5,B0042L0P1C,"Where do you even start with a review for this movie? This might not even qualify as a ""review"" in the typical sense. Well to explain my ""paradigm"" from which I'm coming from, let me say i've always had a fascination with violence and ""disturbing content"" on film and in the media. So I've seen a lot of ""horror movies"" but also a lot of other weird things. I've explored the worst of the worst but virtually never is there a film where violence is used to inflict really, really soul-scarring damage. That is because, you see, most ""extreme"" violence films are what I would call ""Trashy"". This can refer to the poor quality of their presentation, but more often it refers to an attitude about violence. Violence used for entertainment, I think, is perfectly okay and sometimes very awesome. On the other hand, violence as a tool to evoke a different emotional effect has an entirely different effect on us as a viewer. And I have always been interested in those latter kinds of things. I don't know why. Humans have always had that curiosity, they just externalize it differently.

Most of the ""most disgusting/violent/disturbing movies"", according to the internet, are actually in this ""trashy"" category, so they aren't _really_ all that disgusting or violent or disturbing. They are just dumb and do not create an emotional effect beyond something superficial and shallow. Often they are just bad movies so they generate contempt for wasting anyone's time. They certainly do not create a real sense of HORROR or TERROR. And you know, I have always wanted to find the pinnacle of _really_ disturbing/violent films for years now.

That movie is definitely _A Serbian Film_, without any doubt. I will not discuss the story at all or refer in detail to any specific scenes. I don't even really think anyone should watch this movie, and you can go read more about it elsewhere. I'm not really here to make this movie sounds interesing so that you go watch it, and honestly the basic premise is pretty clever so if I avoid that issue it's probably for the best.

But I will say -- without hesitation but still feeling a bit weird about it -- _Serbian Film_ is a MASTERPIECE. It is the scariest film of all time, easily. The way it creates an emotional attachment, establishes an atmosphere of utter, paralyzing dread, and its escalation from one unbelievably devastating, brutal, and shocking scene to another, is really, really effective. This movie really really, really terrifying. In terms of craftsmanship, the filmmakers really deserve credit. They know what makes a good horror film, and then they just raised the intensity and brutality to infinity and beyond. The level of depravity and cruelty inflicted upon people in this movie is really unimaginable to the average person. Your heart will feel like it's going to explode about halfway into the film... and then it gets way worse. I almost couldn't bear to see what was going to happen in the end (although it's somewhat predictable, which actually makes it WORSE as the end approaches), but I did and it sucked. No, the ending did not suck in the sense that it was ""bad"", because it was a good ending in terms of climactic narrative, but in the sense that it BAD -- like ""that's the worst thing I can ever imagine happening"" kind of BAD.

Some people will jump in at this point and say, ""Oh well it can't be as bad as X"". No, shut up. You don't know what you're talking about. It's way, way worse than X. I promise you, I have seen all those obscure movies you scour google for days and weeks to find. ""Oh but have you seen--?"" Yes, I've seen it. ""But i bet you haven't seen--"". No, _i've seen that too_. And it's mostly trash.

But here is why this movie is not ""trash"". First of all, it is extremely well made. The acting is very effective, the writing is sharp (even with some nice moments of tenderness and humor early on). But most importantly the story, which is probably not very realistic or anything, is completely absorbing and it makes the viewer care. We can appreciate the main character's situation. He seems to be a likable dude. We want good things to happen to him and his family. But, then he is lured in by what seems to be a good opportunity and becomes quite literally enslaved to evil. Our empathy becomes horror magnified a thousandfold by the fact that we give a damn, and by the unbelievable intensity of evil perpetrated -- manipulating someone into doing something they would never do, something that is so vile that even talking about it will make you puke.

It almost makes you forget that you are watching this movie because it's supposedly the ""nastiest ever"" and not because it's just a good movie. Almost. But then it beats you like a sledgehammer as a good movie AND the nastiest.

And yet here is the paradox. This is not really a good movie, like ""I recommend this"" or ""I would watch this again."" In that sense, it is the worst movie. But because it is the best worst movie, it is actually amazing. But your soul will be shattered when you watch it. The ending is literally the most horrible thing ever on film. I will certainly never, EVER watch it again. Just thinking about it makes me feel bad. But I cannot deny that it is incredibly powerful on its own terms, and it has to be taken seriously. This is not like our normal horror movies where violence is really part of the fun. But here with _Serbian Film_, you dread violence like you do in real life. That is a powerful effect and I can count the number of movies like that on one hand. All possible goodness in this movie is utterly broken, corrupted, and destroyed by the end, through abject violence. Your soul bleeds into the ether as the credits roll.

Is this movie ""deep"" or interpretative on some level? I don't know. Maybe it doesn't matter. ""This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about."" Those are the words of the director. Take them for whatever they're worth. Indeed, truly horrible things happen to people in real life. Real horror is real people dying and suffering and being forced to do awful things with real consequences. In that sense, this movie is not that bad. No one died. No one got hurt. No actual children were exposed to anything inappropriate. But by drawing on some a real sense of loss and tragedy and horror they grew up with, the filmmakers create a really powerful horror film. I find that interesting.

My heart is racing just thinking about this movie. I feel like i could faint. Why did I even write this review? It makes no sense, i gave it 5-stars saying no one should see it and you will be scarred by it and probably react negatively _even if you normally dig this stuff_. Seriously. I could give it one-star and have the same content for this review. Another reviewer somewhere said it best, ""You don't want to see this movie. You only think you do."" Be careful. You can't go back in time and un-watch this movie after you watch it.  And so in seeing _A Serbian Film_, my quest for the most violent and disturbing film of all time is over. After seeing this movie, I am reduced to spending the rest of my days watching nice happy things like episodes of ""Sailor Moon"".",1316476800,51,7338,4.56492027334852

Instead, I will describe simply how this movie will make you feel, and the effect it had on me. And let it be known that I've watched some dark movies. I have watched some bleak movies. I have watched controversial movies.

This movie digs up every vile, disgusting and bloodcurdling perversion you can imagine AND THEN SOME. Amazon will not allow me to describe most of them, and I feel filthy just by even trying to.

It then assaults your screaming brain until you simply curl up on the couch and weep silently into your throw pillows.

This movie makes the ""Saw"" franchise look like romantic comedies.

It made me feel so unclean that I wanted to scrub off my own skin. That didn't help.

It made me want to hit myself with a hammer so I wouldn't remember it.

It is the most likely film in history to inspire people to stick guns down their throats.

If there was a movie that would convince God himself to wipe out the human race in Great Flood 2.0, it would be this one.

It sucks away all joy, hope and satisfaction out of the world, leaving a nihilistic void of pain, blood and death from which nothing positive will ever come. And that's just how it is for the people watching it.

And in my sole editorial from a purely artistic nature: As far as I can tell, this movie was made entirely to shock and revolt everyone who watched it, just because they COULD. In that regard, it succeeds. I'm sure the people who made it would argue that it had lots of metaphor and subtle layers, but I don't care.

So in conclusion, do not watch ""A Serbian Film"" unless you are trying to psych yourself up enough to shoot yourself in the head. Or want to come up with an excuse to make war on Serbia.

For as disturbing as the imagery and subject matter may be I really can't think of one scene that could be lifted from the film without destroying the story. Certainly this was not a filmmaker who intended to use shock for the sake of shock, but some one who meticulously crafted each scene as an integral piece of the story regardless of how atrocious it may be. This is no mere exploitation film, and indeed a film you will hate yourself for loving.",1314144000,9,814,4.292207792207792

This film is not a porno,
nor does it overtly critique the porn industry.
It accuses multinationals, and mainstream news media, for its part in creating and
then covering-up war crimes, and if you do not know what this means see one of the greatest books of the century, ""NEWSPEAK in the 21st Century"", by MediaLens and David Cromwell (the US Amazon site blocks my attempt to put a product link to this book, though they do sell it. The Canadian and British Amazon sites allow the link ... they all sell this. Well worth a read!)

Every day we see images that are much much more shocking - because they are real images of real people suffering, on TV news - than anything in this film. Turn off mainstream corporate TV news if you want to censor something that is really sick, but do not censor this film. Whether or not you can face watching a film that, to all intents and purposes is less shocking than ""I Spit On Your Grave"" was in its day, do not let the hype put you off, nor the frenzied hatred that has been invoked in those who utter such bile in their rabid attempts to stop you from seeing this.

This film points a finger at the war-mad corporate machine that drives governments, and that is backed-up by its own (well-controlled and out on a leash) mainstream media, that lives off the endless death, carnage and suffering perpetrated on millions of innocents (e.g. to date over 1 million dead in Iraq since 2003) to feed the hunger that brings back the viewer, time and time. for more so-called 'news', filtered information that is propagandized by TV corporate cartels who decide what is and what is not the news that you will see. You don't believe that?
Then check out
""Censored 2010 (Censored: The News That Didn't Make the News -- The Year's Top 25 Censored Stories)""
or any of the other books by that title, one of which is issued every year, and has been for the last 30 years. Every year you will find would-be block-buster news stories that were simply 'blocked' by mainstream news, the few with all the broadcasting power (again, the US Amazon site blocks my attempts to put a product link to this book, though they do sell it, and all the others)

MUST-SEE films, really great flix of our age,
that are quietly ""banned""
by corporate media
and blanked by the multinational news cartel: [...]

""A Serbian Film"" plays with an extreme, yet an imagined part of the world of porn, the so-called 'snuff' movie, a mythical & invisible pillar in the darkest heart of the temple of pornography (where, supposedly, some unfortunate porn stars have been lured to meet their fate ... for the 'exquisite' delectation of a select few super-addicts who can no longer get satisfaction from plain old sex on the screen. No snuff movie has ever been proved to have existed but it is a useful and scary tool in showing how state-sponsored terror often ignores the rule of International law(let alone common decency) and bombs or attacks countries to preempt ... ""a smoking gun in the shape of a mushroom cloud"" (as war criminal C.Rice put it); or to 'protect' the poor and defenseless natives (by killing other poor and defenseless natives) and then lets its news cameras in to film the aftermath, the shoe in the rubble, the bloodbath in the sand, the severed bits'n'pieces under makeshift blankets; and the real pain and anguish or survivors and loved ones, all for a strange visual pleasure, for the consumption of 'news' over dinner, or on the move - watch it on the way to work on BBCiplayer - and reassurance of the public that protection is available, at a price.

This film is not a film that abuses minors; nor does it espouse child abuse - no more than Stanley Kubrick did in ""The Shining"". No one in their right mind would say ""The Shining"" was abusive to minors, though it places youngsters like the twin girls aside gushing torrents of blood; and it puts Danny (and 'Tony', 'the little boy who lives in his mouth') in stark view of the blood that gushes when the axe-wielding maniac protagonist chops-up chef Halloran, and threatens to do the same to his son, as he chases Danny from the bathroom to the snow-covered maze.
""A Serbian Film"" is attacked by censors because it shows a child - dressed and doing absolutely nothing to do with sex - on a television screen, whilst unsavory acts are happening in the room where the TV is situated! The denouement and other scenes involving children are not explicit, and certainly not abusive, however, they are shocking to the viewer, as they are meant to be. Compared to what Danny went through in ""The Shining"", nearly 40 years ago, the kids who act in this film are surly guaranteed to come out of it with less mental scarring than the poor lad who played ""Danny"" did. They are seen acting upset and shocked, yes, that much is true, though they are not subject to sexual abuse or used in scenes where difficult scenes are acted out. Remember that thing called editing? Editing often gives us a different impression but that's all it is. Editing can associate a sea-horse with ""The Grand National"" horse-race but it does not mean the little marine creature actually raced there.

This film attacks the pornographic pointing of mainstream news lenses; the invasion of places and lives where those cameras were not welcome, where they should not be; places where, because they are present, propaganda and manipulation become possible.

Serbia - and Yugoslavia before it - was one of the first, modern-day, European victims of a neo-fascism that has been on the rise in governments in the west since the days of Presidential-usurper L.B.J. (upon whom Jackie Kennedy recently was heard to lay blame, for the assassination of JFK - fact : her tapes were just released, mid-August 2011).
The end of Yugoslavia and what happened between the warring parts (no sides taken by this reviewer) and the other people there (the majority, i.e. the non-combatants), is at the cutting edge of this film's visor; seen through the lens that spies-out a family that had thought it had managed to 'retire' from the dangers of the world. It reminded me of the protagonist's family in Michael Mann's Manhunter [DVD] [1989]: a man, his wife and their child; he is trying to get over his past occupation and infamy - as a John Holmesesque porn star - for the sake of the unity of his family. His wife is fully understanding, intelligent and loving; and they have a dream kid.
The family has just about survived being 'bought and sold' by the sex industry; dad has chewed-up and spat out just about every porn starlet on video, and his shelf-top collection of his old porn movies demonstrates so. He is soon lured, once more, by the hard cash of the porn set, but this time he is contracted, unknown to him, by a snuff movie cartel that reaches to the highest (and lowest levels). This cryptocracy of snuff-movie producers, played by darkly attired, heavily 'weaponized' ""Blackwater"" lookalikes (that post-war lot, now called ""Xe"", who work for neo-conservative governments in the west) who employ a legion of 'terminators', young, fit and muscle-bound dudes in black with big ... movie cameras! These Steven Segal types look like NSA Black Opz boys from the darkest of CIA lists (like that one from c. 1997, known simply as ""Al Qaeda"" ... when that name represented little more than a list of CIA-backed fanatics carrying guns into mercenary arenas of slaughter) from where Sarah Palin might have liked to have drawn her front-line fodder; the kind of dudes she wanted to use to execute Julian Assange, for example. Terminators set loose, in the pay of very high echelons within the global corporate cartel.

Without plot-spoiling, at the start think ... ""Resident Evil"", the above ground scenes at Umbrella Corp., at the moment of the shut-down; think ... ""Memento"", think waking-up and wondering where all the blood came from, the back-tracking, re-tracing your steps, this time with the aid of discarded video camcorders and tapes - which show you shocking and graphic depictions of you, yourself, over the last three days; a time you cannot remember...a time you do not want to remember!

In the opinion of this reviewer, ""A Serbian Film"" is a lot less shocking than some current offerings that have gone unscathed by the reactionary fury that has hammered this film. For example, there is the recent French horror film, ""Martyrs"". It is a lot harder to watch. It's about inflicting as much pain as possible on a person, whilst keeping them alive, so as to achieve a modern martyrdom, after a year or more of intense suffering, to briefly 'see' what lies beyond death, and to impart that news to the corporate-like cult that has induced the endless agonies - before the poor victims are finally, thankfully dying. ""A Serbian Film"" is not easy viewing but it is not showing pain for pleasure's sake. It does not show the skinning of a a living girl by religious fanatics, as ""Martyrs"" does. It is a stark commentary on what is happening today, not just to Serbia and other post-war Balkan states, but to Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, Syria; and in Saudia Arabia, to name but a few!

Warning: this is not for the faint-hearted. There is plenty of blood and a lot of sexual violence, against men as well as women.

4251898,5,B0042L0P1C,"Over the course of the last 5 years or so the world of cinema has seen a handful of films whose main attraction, for most, is the hype around the brutality: Pascal Laugier's 2008 film `Martyrs', Tom Six's 2009 film `The Human Centipede' & Srdjan Spasojevic's 2010 film `A Serbian Film'. The thing that differentiates those three particular films from the run of the mill cash grab trash films like the Saw series is their capacity for resonating with the viewer long after initial viewing; there are moments in each three of the listed films that 99% of viewers will never forget for the rest of their lives. Where as a Saw film will shock you for a few seconds, making you turn to your friends in awe asking ""Did you see that?!"", `A Serbian Film' will grasp your mind, imprint its images upon your psyche, and make you ever so slightly more curious about just exactly what the people you know do when they're alone. I'd had the film recommended to me in a sort of roundabout way, ""you haven't seen A Siberian Film yet?"" I was asked.

I searched for a synopsis that only sort of sparked my interest: retired porn star needs money to help his family, get suckered into making snuff films, alright, whatever. About a month later I randomly remembered the film and searched yet again and after reading that the film contained, without censorship, ""infant rape, child rape, necrophilia & decapitation during sex: among other things"" I thought to myself ""I have to see this."" Not so much because I'm a gore junky, this is hardly the case, but every once in a while I get a little scratch in my mind that won't go away until I see what the fuss about a particularly so called ""brutal"", ""extreme"" or ""relentless"" film is all about. A lot, around 98%, of the films turn out to be absolute trash, but every once in a great while one of these ruthlessly brutal films contains more than just what is bleeding on the screen; there's something more, something intellectually stimulating. So, I took the whole 2 or 3 minutes it took to find a torrent of the film, because lets face it it might be a while before this reaches DVD in the US. The copy that I ended up with was the ""Screener Version"" or something like that; it says that its the unedited version and if there is a more complete version than this then I think that maybe Satan is real and he exists as that longer version because all that was found in the version that I saw was more than enough to permanently scar most people.

Spasojevic has said in reaction to the controversy surrounding his debut film that its meant to be taken as a symbolic tale, an allegory of how the Siberian government treats its people. Now, when a director has a bad film on his hands and they know its terrible, or eventually realizes how horrible it is, they will try to play the whole ""Yeah, this is how I meant it to be seen."" (Tommy Wiseau, I'm lookin' at you, no ones buying it.) card, but after seeing `A Siberian Film' I can understand Spasojevic's statement. Now, I know next to nothing about the circumstances in current Siberia so I won't go around saying that this is symbolic of this or that, but what I will say that in a general sense one can view the film as a symbol for the general willingness of humanity to exploit others without sympathy. The powers that be will more than willingly drug those below them, not literally of course, into a state of confusion so that they eventually become nothing more than puppets capable of the most heinous and disgusting acts imaginable, but only after lying to them about how they're simply looking out for their best interests, that whatever is to come will be okay because they have it under control. Now drink this and do what I say. The fact that the film is titled `A Serbian Film' begs the question ""Why this title?"" It could have been given a multitude of other names, but Spasojevic intended for people to see this film and understand that this is his venomously hateful view of his country & government, full of immoral opportunistic scum.

Some have declared that the director is criticizing his country for willing to become more like the West, that the film is nothing more than some sort of fascist fear mongering propaganda film portraying the influence of the west as one of hedonistic and full of decadence and debauchery. This feels like reaching for a grain of sand in a dark room the size of the Atlantic ocean. This simply reads as Serbians, or people of Serbian descent, reacting the way the director wanted them to; shame. Now, perhaps its shame that the director, in their views, is depicting their homeland as a place of nothing but pimps, prostitutes, pornographers and other societal goodies, but again, this just seems like spitting in the wind.

The premise of the film is as simple as they come: A man needs money to help his wife & son. How he gets it is something not so commonly found. A retired porn star he receives a tip from an ex-""coworker"" that there is a new breed of porn emerging from their country to be released to the whole world: Art Porn. Milos, the main character, meets with the man in charge, a man by the name of Vukmir Vukmir (chillingly odd coincidence that a psychotic woman with the same last name has been recently elected to the Wisconsin State Senate.) Milos asks his brother, a man jealous of Milos' family life (obviously indicated by the fact that he got fellatio while watching a home movie he shot of his sister in-law), a cop to check up on his employer and nothing incriminating is found. Things begin to turn dark and darker amd eventually there is no possibility of turning back from the bottomless abyss into which Milos has been flung.

The effects in the film do more than their job in convincing the viewer of their dedication to a realistic depiction of decapitation, forced anal sex and a few other things that I'll leave as a surprise to whomsoever is brave enough to seek this out, or to watch it with me. There isn't really much to say about the cinematography of the film as with a film like this cinematography is of little to no importance; its the impact of the experience that matters the most. There is no real bad acting to be found in the film, from the lead characters to the tiniest role everyone does a compelling and convincing job with their characters. The soundtrack works to create a mood of impending doom and chaos.

`The Human Centipede' is disturbing in a ""what if"" sense; ""What if some guy, or gal, was psychotic enough to do something like this for no real particular reason other than their own gratitude. `A Serbian Film' is disturbing in a realistic, 100% visceral sense, because you know in the back of your mind after watching this that the movies you saw being filmed are sitting somewhere on a shelf in someone's house.",1301184000,5,6810,4.523538961038961
4251899,1,B0042L0P1C,"I'm not easily offended, and in fact I like edgy movies, but this film is totally sick. What is sad about it is that the director is not untalented, and for the first hour this seems to be a very good if disturbing movie. Unfortunately, the last half hour goes downhill in the most sickening way. In Serbia, Milos, a former porn legend, currently out of work and living a family life with a wife and a small kid, is tempted with huge money to step out of retirement to participate in a new kind of artsy porn film. He is not told the argument of the movie (as if porno films have such things) and the mysterious director, one Vukmir, seems totally off the rocks. But since he needs the money he agrees to do it. Unfortunately, his misgivings turn out to be very true, since he is soon forced to participate in increasingly degrading acts, a nonstop parade of horrors (including, and I suppose I'm giving some spoilers here, killing a woman with a machete while he is having intercourse with her, the rape of a baby and of his own small kid) for which he will eventually take revenge. As I said, I think there is some talent here, but is so sick that is not worth it. What is laughable is some reviews I read which try to justify this film as a metaphor or an allegory for the rape of Serbia during the war or something like that. Believe me, there is nothing here about that.",1301097600,11,1375,4.272030651340996
4251900,4,B0042L0P1C,"A Serbian Film (Srdjan Spasojevic, 2010)

Purveyors of overtly sexual, extremely violent, or a combination of the two, films used to have a name: exploitation filmmakers. While they've always been known for pushing the envelope, most of the time it was envelope-pushing for envelope-pushing's sake. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with that; every once in a while you'll come across an ecstatic review for Russ Meyer, H. G. Lewis, Hideshi Hino, the Dark Brothers, Gaspar Noe, Eli Roth, etc. that's ecstatic because said director's film, whichever it may have been, pushed the envelope in an enjoyable or artistic way (I just read Jonathan Rosenbaum's quick explication of Noe's I Stand Alone in his book Movie Wars, so it's not just us amateurs out there saying ""hey, some of this stuff is actually worth watching"").Down the years, however, ""exploitation filmmaker"" has come to be nothing more than a euphemism for ""porn purveyor"", and when one talks about exploitation filmmaking in the twenty-first century, one is almost always talking about porn, unless one is referring to one of the old greats or using the term in a somewhat twee manner. I submit that this is because, in America at least (and, I suspect, many of the other major film markets), we're somewhat blissfully unaware of the film culture in Eastern Europe, where old-school exploitation cinema has been rolling grandly along ever since the fall of the USSR. And if anyone these days should have a license to make exploitation films, it's the constituents of the former USSR. After all, under Stalinist socialism and post-Stalinist capitalism alike, these folks have been exploited through and through. This is a great thesis statement for a paper on Bela Tarr As Exploitation Filmmaker, but that's not what this review is about. Instead, I'm looking at Srdjan Spasojevic's A Serbian Film, a 2010 release that did everything, on the meta level, an exploitation film is supposed to do: it generated endless amounts of controversy, got savaged by the critics who deigned to review it, and garnered more publicity than any other film that's come out of Serbia since the fall of the USSR. Actually, let me rephrase that: no Serbian film in history has ever had news of its existence reach as many ears around the world as has A Serbian Film. Now, if Spasojevic were Herschell Gordon Lewis, or even Gaspar Noe, whose films usually have some sort of underpinning of social commentary even if it's never fully explored, that would probably have been reason enough to make his movie. After all, where there's smoke, etc. But Spasojevic is actually making a serious movie here. It bleeds social commentary, quite literally; A Serbian Film is the first true gorenography film, not that there have been many, that actually works as a movie rather than as a series of cheap (in every sense of the term) thrills. It's no surprise that the critics hated it; most of them have never run across a gorenography flick before, given that most of them are shoddy, stupid direct-to-video productions aimed, like most exploitation cinema, at making a quick buck. Spasojevic, on the other hand, is giving us the dark, ugly underbelly of Alexei Balabanov's absurdist 2007 film Gruz 200 (elsewhere in this issue), and for much the same reasons. Balabanov was already headed for the outskirts of the envelope with that one, albeit in a Pirandello kind of way. Spasojevic, on the other hand, sees nothing at all funny about the situation, and the result is one of the most brutally depressing movies I've ever sat through.

Milos (Underground's Serdjan Todorovic) is a retired star of any number of low-rent Eastern European porn films. (In one of the film's rare touches of humor, Milos keeps his cash in a dvd box for a film he made called Acockalypse Now.) Spasojevic is not going to soft-pedal you into the movie; the opening shot shows us Petar, Milos' son (his age is never given, but he's in the vicinity of eight years old; pertinently, the actor playing him is uncredited, at least on IMDB), having stumbled upon a DVD called Milosh the Horny Stud, which he's in the process of watching, somewhat confused, when his mother Marija (The Beautiful Blue Danube's Jelena Gavrilovic) catches him at it, prompting a family discussion about Milos' former profession. (Porn, Marija tells Petar, is ""like cartoons for grown-ups"". Given the current state of the US porn industry, indeed.) Milos, as it turns out, has revisited the film because his co-star, Lejla (Dorcol-Menhetn's Katarina Zutic; I know you don't recognize that name, so I'll let you know that I've heard it referred to as the worst film to ever come out of Serbia), has asked to meet with him. They do, and Lejla has a proposition for him: do one more film, with a mysterious director named Vukmir (Next's Sergej Trifunovic), for which he is promised enough money for his family to live in comfort for the rest of their lives. You've seen enough movies to know what that promise means, but Milos hasn't, and after talking it over with Marija, he decides to go ahead with the project given the amount of money involved. It becomes obvious, with the secrecy of the filming and the odd choices of sets, which Milos is only introduced to as we are, that something is very, very wrong here. While you've most likely heard about many of the depths this wrongness goes to, I'll not spoil it for you other than to say that this movie goes places you've never seen in a serious movie. Ever.

Even many of those critics who have most savaged it agree on one thing: once it's got its hooks in you, you're along for the ride. No matter how depraved, brutal, and ugly Spasojevic gets, you cannot force yourself to stop watching the parade of decadence in front of you. In an odd way, it reminds me of Tinto Brass' infamous Caligula, with the caveat that Spasojevic has more filmmaking acumen in his left elbow than Tinto Brass had in his entire career, not to mention a better vehicle for getting his point across. Yeah, he ditches subtlety (if anything about this movie can be called subtle) and smacks us in the face with his comparison between obscene, disgraceful pornography and his country's situation, but he only does it for one scene, and it actually makes sense in the context of the film (Vukmir draws a comparison between exploitation filmmaking and Serbian society while attempting to convince Milos to work for him). Perhaps more appropriately, given that, imagine Anthony Burgess, the young, angry Anthony Burgess who wrote The Wanting Seed (which is even more savage than A Clockwork Orange), having grown up in post-Soviet Serbia, and you can imagine him writing this novel, even if you can't imagine Spasojevic filming it so faithfully. (Spasojevic wrote the script himself along with Aleksandar Radivojevic, wrtier of Tears for Sale and son of Misa Radivojevic, one of Serbia's best-known directors in the seventies and eighties.)

I'm certainly not going to say that Spasojevic's envelope-pushing is not a draw here; for those who are naturally drawn to extreme films, A Serbian Film is the must-see movie of the last decade. All the hyperbole that's flown around about letdowns like Grotesque and A'linterieur flies here. I realize that anyone reading this a couple of years from now will wonder what the hell I'm talking about, because any pushed envelope never goes back to shape, but as of early 2011, you have never seen anything like this. Not just because of the subject matter, but because the porn bits are filmed by Spasojevic to hold almost no prurient interest whatsoever, save that first bit we see of Milosh the Horny Stud, which is typical crap-porn. (Another of Spasojevic's little bits of cold humor: that clip is the only part of the movie in which characters speak English, save Vukmir's description of the most disgusting scene in the film. Think on that.) But at the risk of the same proselytizing I often accuse artists of dabbling in unsuccessfully, I rush to add that unlike most extreme violence/torture porn/gornography/modern exploitation (in the classic sense of the term) movies, that is not all there is to this movie, by any means. That is a distinction that many critics missed, presumably because they heard all the same publicity the rest of us did, passed this off as yet another Hostel clone, and then watched it through that filter. Let me go back to Rosenbaum's Movie Wars (and if you can't tell, I haven't even finished it yet and it's already one of my favorite books of the year): to paraphrase, critics bring their own baggage to the table. (I apologize for paraphrasing, but I cannot for the life of me find the quote in question.) We all form opinions about a movie before we see it, and the lenses we view a movie through are colored by those opinions. This is not an unknown thing; I know dozens of fellow film buffs who refuse to read reviews of a movie before they see it in order to avoid just that sort of coloring. I'm hoping to go the other way here, obviously, and do what reviews are supposed to do: get you to see, or not see, a movie. It should be obvious by now that my aim is the former. And given the reactions of a number of critics, I'm going to tell you right up front that unless you already understand the conventions of exploitation film as it's done in the twenty-first century, you will probably despise this movie. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, because Spasojevic's art here is no less valid than Balabanov's in Gruz 200. Or, to keep on with the Eastern European absurdist theme, Makavejev's WR: Mysteries of the Organism.

As an aside, a point of clarification: while I drew a contrast, and it is a stark one, between Spasojevic's and Balabanov's films, I in no way meant to convey that Spasojevic's film is not in the same tradition of absurdity. The difference is in how that absurdity is conveyed. Balabanov works in the same lines as the absurdists of the twentieth century in that he straddles that line between laughing and crying by mostly staying on the comedy side of that line. But remember the old saw in question: sometimes you must laugh, because the only other option is to cry. Spasojevic simply embraces the other option, which is an equally valid, though rare, form of absurdist thinking. And he does it well enough that we can be reasonably certain he is just as aware of Pirandello, Calvino, Milorad Pavic (even more on point, as Pavic is Serbian as well), and that lot as Balabanov is. The end of the climax/beginning of the denouement will show you that in no uncertain terms, if you haven't already figured it out; it should be one of those moments of black humor I was talking about before, but instead it is Spasojevic's finest moment of absurdity-as-pathos, and it is stunningly--one might say absurdly--successful.

But back to the point I was making previously in re: the art of the exploitation film, or the art of this particular exploitation film, since ""art"" and ""exploitation"" have been mutually exclusive terms for so long. The main problem is that this is a film bound to alienate its target audience, that being serious filmgoers, because Spasojevic is as steeped in exploitation film as he is in absuridsm, or even art film. A filmmaker like Balabanov, Gela Babulani (13 Tzameti), or Gyrogy Palfi (Taxidermia) understands that in order to keep an audience of serious art-film buffs in their seats, one has to make some concessions to the art-film crowd, even when one is making that rare beast, a non-cheap exploitation film. Balabanov, as I've said, does it with comedy, as does Palfi; Babulani went the action route, but steered as clear of the gore aspect of his subject matter as he could, preferring to concentrate on the psyche of his main character. Spasojevic is keenly aware of the psyche of his main character; in fact, the phantasmagoric, disjointed quality of much of the film's second half is based entirely on Milos' own emotional state. (Stick with it during the confusing bits of that passage, which seem to make no sense timewise; it all becomes clear eventually.) But Spasojevic was entirely unwilling to make any concessions at all to the art-film crowd, even though this is a film made as much for them as it is for the gorehounds. And while this is not at all a film for beginners (at the very least, ease yourself into Eastern European exploitation flicks with some of those I've mentioned above, especially Gruz 200, Taxidermia, and WR), I think that once you have a handle on the filmic language that Spasojevic is speaking, a sort of odd Esperanto of Eli Roth and Sergei Paradjanov, you'll get a lot more of what he's saying than most critics who reviewed the movie did.

I had originally given this movie three and a half stars (mostly to give myself the option of not integrating it into my list of the thousand best films of all time, which currently ends about halfway through the three-and-a-half star movies), but in the writing of this review/essay/polemic/whatever-it-is, I've realized Spasojevic deserves more than that, not only because this is as important a film in the envelope-pushing realm as were some other films I've given four stars to over the years (Saw, Behind the Green Door, etc.), but because, as a couple of reviews I've read have said, underneath the slick sheen of gorenography on the surface of A Serbian Film, there is, quite simply, a very well-made picture to be had. The acting by all and sundry is top-notch, the script is heartbreaking, and Spasojevic is a true directorial artist, just as much as Noe or Miike, and probably a couple of notches better than Roth. There is also a great deal to be said about the genius cinematography of Nemanja Jovanov, whose understanding of the effectiveness of chiaroscuro rivals David Lynch's, the editorial flair of Darko Simic, and the excellent score from Sky Wikluh, more inspiring because the last two of those are amateurs working on their first features, but I have already gone on far too long about this movie. I have written almost twenty-five hundred words on why you should see this movie; I could easily write another twenty-five hundred telling you why you should appreciate, if not enjoy, it. To call this an important film is probably understating the case, if anything, but it's important for what most serious critics would consider all the wrong reasons. All I can say to that is judge for yourself. This is as solid a piece of cinema as any I've seen this year, but like a number of other films in my top thousand, I may never watch it again. ****",1300233600,6,14607,4.7986497220015885

I can only think of a few occasions where my curiosity drew me toward something I wish I didn't experience.  A Serbian Film is one of those films and probably along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sal/dp/B0019X3ZZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sal</a>&nbsp;the only actual work of fiction.

Those are all hard movies to watch but this was different.  This put my mind at intense unease and put an uncomfortable feeling in my gut.  It could be akin to viewing such non-fiction atrocities like the Dagestan massacre video at the beginning of the Second Chechnyan War or the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs in the Ukraine who video-taped and photographed their killing spree in 2007 (one video of which made it to the internet).  That's how unsettling A Serbian Film was, but in the spirit of William Castle and Wes Craven, remember and repeat; it's only a movie, it's only a movie.

A Serbian Film is also not necessarily out of the realm of possibility despite having scenes that are uncalled for and at times just laughably deranged or absurd.  I simply wish I could somehow erase A Serbian Film from my memory.  With those kinds of warnings I'm sure many hardcore gore fanatics are now curious while reading this, but I strongly caution that even you absolutely do not want to see A Serbian Film.

Milos is a former porn star with a wife and a young boy.  His life has obstacles, most of which is probably his brother who seems to fancy Milos's wife, but it all changes when Milos is given a very high paying job offer for more pornographic work, with a catch that he is not to know what is going to happen as the film is made.  The film's director is extreme to say the least and Milos finds himself in a world of child pornography, necrophilia, rape, and even outright snuff films.  Needless to say the film's arc lends itself to some shocking images but even with that in mind the film goes far enough that we have to think is it being intentionally controversial and provocative.  It wants you to hear someone say its the most horrific film ever made but it is intelligent enough to not only get away with accusations of being gratuitous in some circles, but it is also intelligent enough to enhance its horror with great efficiency.  The story itself also plays on the urban legend of snuff films of course, and even though that has been done before, it is done far better here.  I've always wondered if there could be a market for sick films like that and this film's very existence and potential for success might make a case that there is.  Strangely enough and strictly on a technical level all around, A Serbian Film is actually pretty well done.

There are messages in A Serbian Film that probably have merit.  The idea that it reflects a self-deprecating view of its namesake country, the paranoia toward its authorities, and possible general moral decay there are present in the film, but I simply do not buy the idea that its messages warrant this degree of shocking content.  I don't find it too surprising that some viewers will find that enough to justify its gore and sexual transgressions, so perhaps you may if you decide to challenge yourself with seeing this movie.  But that I can assure you that is a pointless exercise and this kind of shock value is of little to no value at all.  Do not see A Serbian Film.  Seriously, you will likely regret it.",1300147200,6,4733,6.079699248120301

Accepting a job, for a huge sum of money, under the stipulation that hes not to know what hes expected to do; until that moment. Its a metaphor about how the serbian government treat its citizens. Yes, its galvanizing, intense, and shocking. However, its extremely well done and the soundtrack is magnificent. Why the 2 stars then? Because this version is heavily cut and not the intended cut that director wanted to release. Dont bother buying this version. A full fledged better release is in the works for the US markets, as well as in Blu. So save your money and be patient.",1522627200,,650,4.564102564102564
