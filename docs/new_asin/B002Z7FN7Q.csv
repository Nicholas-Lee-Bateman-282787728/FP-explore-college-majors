4013979,1,B002Z7FN7Q,"Looks great...my husband is a HUGE Clint Eastwood fan...I'm just curious as to WHAT this ""collection"" holds...Is it a biogrophy? A collection of movies? A book with some pictures? Hmmmmmmmmmmm. A bit more detail would be nice before paying $125.00 and not knowing what you're getting...",1260057600,6,286,5.239130434782608
4013980,2,B002Z7FN7Q,"This is my second set and I'm still disappointed with the purchase that I originally made. The collection is great, but the copies suck. Both sets  on all movies have froze up and skipped scenes on multiple dvd players. I'm disappointed with the quality of the copies hence why the low rating. Wish I could have rated higher because it is a great collection. The first set I sent back and got a replacement set 3 days later but still has same issues.",1517702400,,450,4.421686746987952
4013981,5,B002Z7FN7Q,Was a gift for someone special.,1516838400,,31,4.333333333333333
4013982,4,B002Z7FN7Q,Loved all of it except for maybe like 7 films (the obscure titles) and the packaging design for the DVD was very awkward to handle.  A simpler design would have worked and Clint only has to have his name in the film credits and people will always think the man was the legend.,1516320000,,276,4.2075471698113205
4013983,1,B002Z7FN7Q,"I picked two of these up at before Christmas at a great price.  One was for me and the other as a present for my dad.  When I opened mine, I noticed the DVD's were very hard to remove from the sleeves.  The first few were actually stuck inside the sleeves. When I was able to break them loose, they emerged scratched and contaminated with a glue-like substance.  This rendered them unplayable.  The next couple I tried removing from the sleeves came out ok and playable.  The next few after that, not so much.  At this point I decided to return them.  I am very disappointed as I love this selection of movies and the print design of the book they come in.  The functionality of the book is another story.  Even though I already owned a few of the titles, the price of this set made the purchase a no-brainer.  I hope these will be available in a different package in the near future.",1515283200,,884,4.296969696969697

4013985,1,B002Z7FN7Q,DVDs are of extremely poor quality. They are scratched and have debris on them. Every one we have watched so far has hung up repeatedly. We are very frustrated.

4014001,4,B002Z7FN7Q,"I have had this collection for a few years now and will not be commenting on the quality of the xfers.  I will leave that to others.  I will be adding my comments regarding the digital upgrade of these DVDs.  There is a downloadable software you can get that will allow you to put the DVD into your drive on home computer and it will read the disc # and tell you if it is upgradeable.  To go from a 480 SD DVD to a 1080 HD digital cloud copy for $5 a piece is a great deal and if you purchase at least 10 at a time you will get a 50% discount, so that's $2.50 a disc.  Plus you then get to stream these ""old"" movies of yours from anywhere...so here goes:

Not eligible - Bronco Billy, The Rookie, Blood Work - really wanted this one as it is based on a novel by Michael Connelly which I like, but no go, True Crime - this one has a nice little ballad at end credits sung by Diana Krall and written by Mr. Eastwood, still not eligible for upgrade -sigh.  Bird can only be up graded to SD, which is basically what you've got with your DVD copy so I chose to forego this one and will wait with crossed fingers that it eventually gets added to available HD titles.

They do seem to add new titles periodically, both recent releases and older movies including some classics.  I am not sure about Million Dollar Baby, Space Cowboys or the 5 Dirty Harry titles because these were already in my UltraViolet digital library and I didn't need to upgrade so I didn't try.  What I can state is that I now have 23 HD copies of Clint 35 Films in my digital library for a nominal fee...so I hope this helps those of you that wish to upgrade their viewing experience.",1464307200,4,1651,4.099378881987578

4014013,4,B002Z7FN7Q,"If you are considering this purchase, you must not think of it as 35 great Clint Eastwood movies in their own protective collector's album at the low price of $117/35=$3.34 per movie.  Some of the DVDs will play only part of the movie, and some will have smudges that indicate prior use.  Some disks will look perfect, but will refuse to play.  So, you need to assume
1) that you'll get between 30 and 35 good movies in which Eastwood acts, directs, or both; and
2) that you'll need to protect them in something much better than the included cardboard album that either
2a) forces you to grasp the disks between thumb and finger, instead of by the edges or the center hole,
2b) or simply dumps disks out of their slots onto the floor.
Personally, I think I acquired about 30 really good movies for about $4 apiece, and I wouldn't have used the album anyway.  I always and only trust my optical disks to VAULTZ CD protector pages.",1440892800,,929,4.447058823529412

A lot of people are complaining about the packaging, but I think its fine.  The discs slide into their cardboard slots with the perfect amount of resistance to keep them in their slot but not rub the surfaces - most of the discs are double-sided.  Yes, you do have to touch the disc playing surface to remove the disc from the packaging, but it's really not a problem (most people don't give DVDs any credit for durability, but you have to really abuse one to ruin it).

Simple fact is all the discs played perfectly for this buyer and the quality was just fine on my 50"" tv.  Not a lot of feature extras - fewer on some titles, more on others - but enough.",1383436800,,829,4.316129032258065

The package is beautifully  presented although it is a little hard to take out a disk from the sleeve however the method that the disks are put into book pages with each of the movies outlined this makes it so quick to find the movie of your choice.

4014078,3,B002Z7FN7Q,"The Good:
I received these movies as a gift for Christmas as it was on my Amazon wish list and the quality appears to be great from what I have seen so far. I look forward to watching all of them as time goes on. Please do not forget to get the Sergio Leone movies as well. No collection could be complete without them but they were not created by Warner Brothers and may never be included in a set like this. This gets five stars from me.

The Bad:
The packaging is alright but could be better. The DVDs are dual sided so they do not have any artwork on them. ""The Eastwood Factor: Extended Version"" was included as an afterthought and was adhered to the outside of the DVD case. This brought my review down 1/2 star.

The Ugly:
Nothing is immune anymore as teal and orange strikes again. For those of you who do not know what I am referring to please do a search for ""Teal and Orange"" or any other search regarding color grading and then do a search for images of Dirty Harry on your favorite search engine. You will notice a color difference between what should be identical screen captures of older versions of the DVD and newer versions of the DVD. The teal and orange color grading brought my review down 1 1/2 stars.

Please note that not everyone is as sensitive to the teal and orange grading as I am and as such may either consider it to be irrelevant or even an added bonus. Because of this your mileage may vary.",1356566400,,1424,4.247232472324724

You could take it into a combat zone and the disks would probably remain safe (unless you wanted to take one out of it's sleeve) barring a direct hit. And therein lies the problem. I don't live in a combat zone. To take out the disks you must grab the disk itself and exert a significant amount of force to pull it out. I watched 3 movies out of this package before I sent it back. The third movie I watched had been so damaged by either it's removal or it's initial insertion that it didn't play well at all. It skipped and froze. If I want these movies I suppose I'm going to have to buy them individually. This problem could be easily fixed by making the sleeves 1) less tight and 2) create a U-shaped cutout so that you could slip your finger into the center hole and slide out the disk without damaging them. Also, the disks themselves are 2-sided disks - something I don't like, but was willing to put up with. You can't tell which movie you are putting in until the main menu comes up. I think that in the future I will avoid ""collections"" since they all seem to be pretty much poor quality, or like this packaged poorly.

Double sided discs I'll accept for low cost budget movies like you'll see on cable TV and the like but for a star of this magnitude it doesn't do him justice. I already have the Dirty Harry box set which has no playing issues on any of my DVD's and has one disc per film. All the others were bought individually over the years at discounted prices and they all play fine. As someone else spotted, where on earth is Play Misty For Me as that was an excellent early movie of his with a serious vein.

Folks, use a small piece of paper to extract the dvds so you don't smudge the disc.  It isn't really that hard.  Backup and re package the discs if you want, but the box isn't that important.  The lead reviewer even returned his set.  Is Eastwood to blame?  Not hardly.

An excellent price for more than 70 hours of very good to excellent Clint Eastwood movies made over a 35 year period, and the emphasis is on the slight, at best, difficulty of removing the dvd from the box?

I'm going to get some cases to put these in, other than the way they are organised, the set itself is a great value, if i'm not mistaken this is all of his films done on WB. The reason the other titles are not in this is because they were done on other labels, Paramount, MGM. etc. If you are looking for a large set of Eastwood films at the best value i recommend this collection along with some of the 3 packs to fill in the gaps but if you plan to watch these films more than once you do want to get some cases!",1330992000,4,796,3.8895705521472395

I normally would not write a movie review for movies that are obviously awesome, but God bless her heart, on paper this is an awesome collection, which it is.

This of course gets them dirty and with fingerprints all over them the more you watch obviously. Even worse, the cardboard they are encased in is rough and scratches them each time you take them out. I think companies like WB do this so you ruin them in maybe hopes you buy them again or something? I really don't know, but they will be ruined the more you use them.

The films have the clarity and richness of colour one would expect from a dvd. The films are basic with very few of the films having special features.

The set is elegantly put together in a book format. The only downside, and it is quite a shame, is how difficult it is to get the films out of the slots. It is inevitable that the discs will have light scratches when one tries to remove them given the way the discs fit into the slots. Some of the discs also had a tiny amount of glue on the surface, which was difficult to remove, but for the most part was  removable with a little abrasion to the disc surfaces. So far all of the discs I have played work fine even if I had to remove some glue, or if they had light scratches. This set may very well drive someone crazy if one is concerned with having mint condition dvds, but for those content to have a great selection of Clint Eastwood films for a cheap price then this set may work out fine.",1322697600,11,1398,4.2679245283018865

4014129,2,B002Z7FN7Q,I won't try to rate the movies as most people already know what they think. I want you to know about the lousy packaging. The discs are tight inside a cardboard sleeve with 2 movies per disc. It is impossible to take them out without fingerprints on your discs. They are labeled with print so small you'll need a magnifying glass to read it. There is no way you'll handle these discs over a period of time without scratching them. The outside sleeve is so flimsy it will soon be split. Really a cheap way to present this set. Thirty-five movies for this price is a good value but plan to put the discs into your own cases or sleeves with your own labeling.,1316822400,117,656,4.298387096774194
4014130,3,B002Z7FN7Q,We are huge Clint Eastwood fans and were thrilled to see this collection. I couldn't wait to see it and share it with my husband for his birthday. The movies are a wonderful collection representing a lifetime of work of Mr Eastwood. The only problem is the packaging is strangely set up in a book form. You have to pull each movie out with your fingers. Difficult to do even with gloves. The slightest grime on the hands make the movies freeze up and start again over and over. When the movies are put back into the book you once again have the chance to smudge up the movie and its quality with your hands. Each movie is dropped into a tight pocket so it is possible they might be damaged in the pocket somehow??? We didn't send the set back because we learned to handle the CDs with rubber gloves. 3 of our movies we ruined but the rest so far are okay. Love Clint though just not the design of the packaging.,1312416000,28,911,4.241379310344827

A lot of gems like ""White Hunter Black Heart "" Honky Tonk Man "" shows just how good an actor Eastwood really is . Great! However the movie disks are all double sided. They re inclosed in a box set that makes it impossible not to smug the disk before playing them. When you open the box set, the carboard book is a bunch of bound together single pockets. You are required to pinch the exposed disk area and pull it out from a very tight pocket.( No paper sleeves!)  This of course will smudge both surfaces.

I also question the resolution of the films. If the dvds are packaged in such a manner, is the copy resolution as high as the single disks we have been buying for years? (more on this later) I will keep the set but I will carefully back up all of them and play those.

If you are expecting a large box set for you book case  where you can clearly and safely pull out the film you need well that's not going to happen.  This is a poorly if not cheaply thought out compilation that due to poor concept packaging does not serve the consumer on the long run if he (or she ) is not carefull.

Basically every disk slides in/out of heavyweight paper pages.

If you really want a complete Clint collection, plan on purchasing some of the 3packs here on Amazon as well. It will really tie things together because there are alot of holes throughout the decades.

4014169,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"The Eastwood Factor: A brilliant, in-depth exploration into the heart of an American icon. His philosophies. His vision. His passion. His films.

Author, award-nominated documentary filmmaker and distinguished film critic Richard Schickel utilizes his experience as a prolific cinematic historian and discriminating film doyen to examine the filmmaking journey of personal friend and venerated actor/director Clint Eastwood.

Schickel's latest film, The Eastwood Factor, is a vivid and intimate documentary that explores Eastwood's unique approach to filmmaking during his 35 year tenure at Warner Brothers' studios. The Eastwood Factor is a fascinating story; a life told in retrospect. Along with commentary from friends and rare photos, Schickel and Eastwood re-visit the sites significant to Eastwood, from his personal costume closet on the Warner Brothers lot to the set locations of some of his landmark movies. Eastwood reminisces about his characters, the movies, and his role, as both actor and director, in some of Hollywood's most celebrated and groundbreaking films.

There is one striking and particularly poignant moment as Eastwood talks about the movie Bird (1988) the life story of jazz musician (and Eastwood's personal musical hero) Charlie Parker, a movie which Schickel refers to as ""a passion project"". Eastwood ponders some elusive connection between Parker's brilliance, talent, insecurity and eventual self-destruction, calling the loss of that talent a crime. Eastwood wonders aloud if perhaps this connection might be true of actors also--a message that resonates with the loss of so many young talents to addiction and overdose in Hollywood.

Eastwood shows his humorous side as well, in talking about his decision to re-write Unforgiven (1992) he says ""I started writing, writing and fooling with things and changing things... and all the sudden I realized I was wrecking it. So I called him [David Peoples] back up and I said forget about that. I'm just gonna shoot it the way it is."" It was a funny and endearing moment hearing this story from Clint Eastwood. A side of him I would not have expected. No ego. No macho preening. A simple admission that sometimes he screws things up, just like everyone else. Except he admits to a bad idea and hands over the reins rather than trying to keep control. A lesson in humility. And probably a large part of the Eastwood factor--His ability to let go of personal ego and let someone else have a shot.

He also talks about his pride in saving the sound stage where most of his film music was scored, now called 'The Eastwood Scoring Stage'. He then muses, with a wicked little humor, that if he had known they would do that he would have asked (Robert) Daly to change the name on the famous Warner Bros' water tower to Eastwood Bros.

On making Million Dollar Baby (2004), Eastwood says that ""Everybody interpreted it as a woman's boxing movie and my theory was... It wasn't. It was a father/daughter love story and that's the way I approached telling it."" It's this type of intimate insight that makes The Eastwood Factor such a compelling film. A chance to appreciate his unique vision, his ability to take what others see as flat black text and pull from it a living, breathing, unforgettable story.

The Eastwood Factor is a rare glimpse into the mind of one of Hollywood's greatest and most driven icons. Richard Schickel has done an outstanding job of highlighting the film career of a Hollywood legend, but more so, of capturing the magnetism and personal filmmaking philosophies of a man that most of us have come to respect for his brilliance, his generosity, his integrity and his passion, not only for the movie making process, but his passion for telling great stories. Stories that have touched us all and sometimes unexpectedly.

The Eastwood Factor was released as part of the Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros. box set collection that celebrates Eastwood's 35th anniversary with Warner Brothers Pictures. It is a must-have for fans and should be requisite in the library of any young actor or director.",1275350400,2,4107,5.074074074074074
4014170,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"Despite some questionable choices with the packaging of this set, the fact remains that you are getting 35 films featuring and/or
directed by one of Hollywood's last great old-timers. A retrospective on Eastwood's thirty five year stint with Warner Brothers
Pictures, each one of these films has merit and value in it's own right. From the zany comedy found in ""Every Which Way But Loose"",
to the grizzled loose cannon cop antics which highlight ""Dirty Harry"", the real appeal of this set is seeing the true range of
Mr. Eastwood's acting and directing ability. No matter the role, he always steps in with great gusto, never breaking character for
even a second. From an acting standpoint, he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors to ever live. From the directing standpoint,
he's skilled in the sense that his vision is always clear; there is never one moment in an Eastwood-directed film that requires
over-scrutinizing a tiny detail. As both a man in action and a man controlling the action, Eastwood is a master of his craft, and will
undoubtedly go down in history as one of cinema's true greats.

This set is a gleaming testament to the range of Clint Eastwood's talent, and is a complete steal for the price; plus, it's a lot
better than wasting a lot of plastic to own each movie in it's individual case. This set is well-designed, sturdy, and
one of the finest gifts you could get for either an avid film buff, a diehard Eastwood fan, or simply as a little treat for yourself.

I great collection of his works spanning many different subjects (westerns, cops, romance, war, space, etc.).All discs played back in fine widescreen quality, not Blu-ray but very good( I watched them on a Panasonic 65"" Flat screen HD TV connected to a Panasonic DMP-BD35 Blu-ray player). The Amazon price was great too, broke down to about $3.65 a film, can't beat that for a great entertainment package. The only film I didn't care for was ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" and that's because I don't like films with sub-titles.

I first heard of this on a sunday morning talk show...I was excited almost as much as when I heard of the Beatles Anthology...

So now you are aware of my age...So what??? Doesn't matter...this release of Eastwood's work is as good as it gets.  Where else can you get a collection of this type for so few $$$...I'll tell you - NOWHERE!

This is the best deal around if you enjoy Clint Eastwood movies...I say 'so what' if the early movies aren't in Hi-Def!  They weren't then either!

And to those comments about enhancing the tapes so they look more like todays releases...I say HOG-WASH!  The original movie experience would probably have left you with, Oh, it was OK but it wasn't in Hi-Def! -or- I liked the movie but it didn't have surround sound!

Go out and watch the new movies with their computer generated crouds and their phony action scenes and leave us older folks with the original experience.

Some of the recent action movies i've seen were so phony that although I enjoyed them the obvious electronic enhancements make me furious...these movies earn Millions!!...so why not use real people??

Long live film and those who seek to preserve it as originally intended...

4014179,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"""Clint: 35 Films, 35 Years""  is a massive, 19-disc box set featuring 34 films starring and/or directed by Clint Eastwood for Warner Brothers over the last three and a half decades.  Because this set focuses on only one studio, a number of major Eastwood films are absent, most notably ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,"" ""Play Misty for Me,"" ""The Beguiled,"" ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Changeling.""

Some of the included titles are ""Dirty Harry,"" ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""Bird,"" ""The Rookie,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" and ""Gran Torino.""  The 35th film is ""The Eastwood Factor,"" a 22-minute documentary from Time magazine critic and film historian Richard Schickel, in which Eastwood visits film locations or sites where his movies were created, on the Warner lot visiting the costume department and Eastwood Scoring Stage, and at his home.  Eastwood reflects candidly about his body of work and the choices he made, and Schickel has included scenes from Eastwood's movies, including his latest, ""Invictus.""

Also in the box set is a 24-page booklet featuring photos from all 34 films, comments by Schickel, studio letters, and quotes from Eastwood about most of the movies contained.",1271980800,3,1280,5.159420289855072

He plays flawed characters that struggle to be better and make the world a better place.  Maybe that's naive today, but still the source for entertaining films and sometimes really excellent films.",1269907200,,549,4.240384615384615
4014185,4,B002Z7FN7Q,"There are 4 factors that seem possibly important when considering this collection: the films themselves; the quality of the reproduction of the films; the included ""extras""; and - particularly for this set - the physical packaging.

THE FILMS: I will not even attempt to ""review"" the films themselves: there is such a broad range that almost anyone is bound to find a few that they like, as well as a few that they do not. Suffice it to say that this is, indeed, a collection for Eastwood fans, who for whatever reason do not already own a bunch of his films. We own a handful - but only ""Josey Wales"" is duplicated by this set, thus its attraction.

REPRODUCTION: This is NOT a blue ray set. Fortunately it is also not PRICED like a blue set. Unfortunately - as noted in other reviews - the film copies presented appear to have been simply duplicated from earlier standard DVD releases. As such, the Picture Quality varies widely, although Audio quality seems to be quite good, even on the older films.
34 films are too many to view in any reasonable time period. We have sampled a subset, viewing portions of films taken from different periods, and trusting (hoping...) that that provides a reasonable expectation for the balance.  Some highlights:

Dirty Harry: The first film in the package, and one of the oldest. Frankly, it looks like a 40 year old film (1971), and one duplicated from a not very well taken care of master at that. This was the first film we sampled, and (equally frankly) my immediate reaction was ""Gee, glad I purchased this locally so I can take it back!""
  Surprisingly, eldest son was less critical: he enjoys a number of older films, and felt the PQ was at least equal to most of the same era.

  In viewing, we noted 3 sources of PQ issues: 1) film grain (of course that is part of what makes a film a ""film"" - as opposed to a Video - which makes it more acceptable); 2) evidence of a dirty / worn master: small blotches that appear to be dust or tiny defects in the original film; and 3) encoding noise; MPEG noise; mosquito noise - or whatever you wish to call it / attribute it to - that appears to have resulted from the compression technique used in the transfer from analog to digital.  All of these were manifest in ""Dirty Harry,"" & in abundance.
  There is, of course, little one can do about the film grain or ingrained dirt / defects, although we did find out that using a Picture Setting of ""Soft"" seemed to help a bit.
  HOWEVER, there is something that can be done about the encoding noise: the ""3D Noise Reduction"" filter in our Panasonic Blue Ray player provides a noticeable improvement in PQ. Using the highest setting, this filter provided a PQ that was at least watchable without cringing.

Where Eagles Dare:  This is the oldest film included in the set: 1968. Similar to ""Dirty Harry,"" it starts out showing noticeable grain & a considerable amount of inherent defects. This happens to be one of my favorite Eastwood films (guilty pleasure I guess....), so we took the time to view additional scenes - and noted something odd: after the beginning scenes, the PQ seemed to improve. Much of the film takes place in rather dark settings, so it is certainly possible that any inherent defects in the original (dust, wear & tear) are simply not as noticeable against the darker backgrounds; and this certainly appears to be true for what we are considering as ""film grain.""
 However, went back and took another look at ""Dirty Harry,"" and it also appears to clear up a bit as the movie progresses. This prompts speculation of whether the outer portion of the film reel is exposed to greater wear and a greater amount of environmental elements (ie: dirt & dust) than inner portions of the film are.
 In any event, after the opening scenes (particularly during & following the parachute landing), PQ improved enough to permit enjoyable viewing - although with the 3D NR still set at its highest level.

Kelly's Heros (1970); The Enforcer (1976): Although older than Dirty Harry, ""Kelly"" seems to be from a much better master. Neither of these could remotely be considered ""High Def"" - and both still seem to benefit from NR - but the upconversion results in a nice viewing experience. Picky viewers might turn their noses up, but would expect most viewers would be able to simply enjoy the movies, at least as far as PQ is concerned.

The Dead Pool (1988); Unforgiven (1992): With a slight edge to ""Unforgiven,"" both of these films upconvert fairly well. Might want to play with NR settings for optimum viewing, but doesn't seem to be critical either way (On or Off). Could probably fool SOME people into thinking these are ""hi def"" - although probably NOT anyone with HDDVD or Blue Ray experience.

Space Cowboys (2000): Another notch better: this is getting close to the PQ of many of our newer (but still SD) dvds. Bet I could fool a LOT of people into thinking it is ""real HD,"" - although, again, would expect most people experienced with HD to notice the shortcomings upon a closer look.

Letters From Iwo Jima (2006); Gran Torino (2008): Both are very good, although not outstanding. ""Letters"" is beautifully photographed, but is saddled with surprisingly chunky subtitling, that often creeps into the Scene portion of the film (as opposed to always appearing in the lower letterbox area).  Although we only viewed a few minutes of Gran Torino, the film did not appear as sharp as expected: there was no particular flaw to point to, so it is possible a more extended viewing would improve this opinion, but it certainly did not seem to further improve upon the (admittedly high) PQ presented by ""Space Cowboys.""

 It is disappointing that the films were not remastered - let alone presented in blue ray - but either of those undertakings would have undoubtedly raised the price of the set by a considerable margin.  In any event, only two of the samples viewed (Dirty Harry & ""Eagles"") had defects that proved distracting, and both of these -  particularly ""Eagles"" - seemed to provide improved PQ as the movie advanced.

 Would, however, suggest running 3D NR, if available, as it offers a noticeable improvement, at least on the earlier films.  By activating this option in the ""User"" (Custom) menu of our blue ray player we are able to leave the settings at ""Normal"" for most DVDs, and switch the blue ray to ""User"" only for those we choose. (Thus being able to leave all tv settings untouched.)  Some the Preset Picture Settings (ie: Normal / Soft / Fine / Cinema) also appear to have a ""softening"" effect on the noise levels of the earlier films, so this might be an option for those without a handy filter setting, or try whatever NR option IS at hand (we have several between TV & Blue Ray, but the ""3D"" seemed to have the most impact).

 As mentioned earlier, Audio quality on all film selections viewed appeared to be fine. All but a couple of the films are presented in Dolby 5.1, although there did not seem to be a lot of content in the surround channels for many of them (as might be expected with earlier films).
 Also, all of the films viewed were presented in Wide Screen format. Watching even the snippets that we did reminded me of how much I have enjoyed many of these films - and how much is lost viewing them on pan & scan or even SD Widescreen Broadcasts (think TCM). Despite my nit-picking above, we expect the vast majority of these disks to provide a most enjoyable viewing experience.

EXTRAS: Enjoyed the DVD covers & b&w photos included in the pages of the binder. The small packet of photos / reproductions of news releases has a couple of interesting items, but is largely a So What?
  All of the films are presented on one side of a DVD (most are flippers), and appear to contain only limited extras. This is regrettable, but understandable given the price point (but then we wouldn't view more than a handful of ""Extras"" for most of these films anyway. Think the HOURS of extras on the Ext Versions of LOTR,  Complete Matrix set, & Complete Aliens set have somewhat burned us out....).
  The included booklet has a few written pages from Richard Schickel - brief, but interesting - followed by a (presumably) complete filmography that provides a short blurb on the films included in the set, but merely lists Eastwood's other work. Would have preferred a bit more info - especially covering the non-included work (although understand why that is NOT in this WB set).  One of the results of leafing through this section is a better understanding of how many of his films are NOT included in the set!  (Beyond the early cowboy movies, this list includes The Eiger Sanction, Escape From Alcatraz, & In the Line of Fire...).
  There is also a DVD with an outtake from ""The Eastwood Factor,"" but ignored it - the complete documentary is supposed to be released this summer, and made available to purchasers of this set. (You can sign up for a copy on the WB website, using a code provided in the package.)

PACKAGING: This appears to be perhaps the most controversial aspect of the set - and other's complaints about it are the primary reason we chose to purchase our copy locally. The package looks nice, and provides room for photographs as well as a pouch for the enclosed literature.
  Disk removal, however, is fussy: it is possible to remove a disk (and reinsert same) without leaving fingerprints, but it requires a) Clean Hands, and b) Some Care in the process - especially as some of the disk storage pouches are significantly tighter than others.
  One of first things I did was to remove, examine, and re-insert each disk: none showed any signs of damage or adhered junk, so would guess / hope that those are isolated cases. Given sufficient care, would not expect any more problems with this arrangement than with some of the ridiculously tight ""nubs"" that hold many DVDs in their traditional storage boxes, although would admit that the dual-sided nature of these disks probably ups the ante a bit.
  Long term storage may also be an issue: preferably, we like to store our DVDs vertically. It seems entirely possible that the weight of this set might eventually break down the spine of the binder that holds the pages up. However, laying the set down on its back for even a few days results in the pages warping (first hand experience....); fortunately, inverting the position seems to put things right again.

 In the end, expect to settle upon vertical storage of the set... And give it 4 Stars as an overall package, with the Price Per Film playing a significant role in that rating, along with the presumption that the films sampled to date - which, all-in-all, do appear able to provide an enjoyable viewing experience - are indeed a fair representation of the balance of those included in the set.",1269820800,6,10794,4.650710152551289
4014186,1,B002Z7FN7Q,"!!!WARNING-WARNING-WARNING!!!

Most of the discs are 2 sided, which is unstable to begin with. Upon arrival and initial inspection, I noticed that almost all the discs were scratched on both sides. They are simply inserted into the packaging without anything to protect them. You have no choice but to actually touch the playing surface of the discs just to get them out, and once out, they don't play! I would not suggest buying this box-set. Spend a little more and get the films individually or do without. It doesn't matter how good a deal this seems to be when the damn discs are not playable.

4014187,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"This collection is amazingly good value. All these classic, enjoyable movies, many commentaries and documentaries, all packaged in a beautifully and uniquely-designed large-format hardback album. It's a pleasure to use and to hold the album and, while it is true you need to pinch the discs between thumb and forefinger to get them out of it, they slide out very readily and easily and I've looked very closely at the discs after doing this and I can't even see a fingerprint on there. On balance I think the packaging design is a real inspiration and is really successful. It's impossible in good conscience to fault this number of great films for this price. I think if Warner Brothers had thrown the discs at me in the street then taken the money from my wallet I'd still be more interested in getting them home to watch than complaining about anything.

Another reviewer incorrectly asserted that the movie names do not appear on the double-sided discs. They do, for example: DIRTY HARRY / reverse side MAGNUM FORCE. Easy.",1268438400,2,1026,4.829545454545454

4014189,1,B002Z7FN7Q,"That describes this box set perfectly (and for what it's worth, that title is not included in this set).

The Good...

I want to point out first of all that this is not a review of any of the films in this collection. What more can
be said about these movies that has not been said many times already? While some may not regard all of the movies included this box in the same esteem and some personal favorites may have been excluded, I think that most people would consider this to be a fine collection of Clint's work at a reasonable price.

The Bad...

The problem is with the packaging of this box set. It is a case where a great idea in concept has gone horribly wrong in the execution. It appears that the designers were more interested in the artistic design (and it does look very nice) with no regard for the functionality of the package.

As other reviewers have noted, the collection is packaged in the form of a book, with pages that are constructed from very stiff paperboard. The pockets that hold the individual DVDs are formed between two sheets of paparboard that have been adhered together. However, the pockets are so tight, it is difficult to remove the discs without grasping them firmly between your thumb and index finger and pulling with some force, resulting in scratches and fingerprints on the disc surfaces. Yet, for me this is not the major issue, since most discs with superficial scratches, while undesirable, will still play with little degradation in picture quality.

The Ugly...

The biggest problem is that the surfaces of about a third of the discs in my set were contaminated with streaks and lumps from the glue that was used to assemble the package, rendering parts of the discs unplayable. I am appalled by the apparent total disregard for quality control. Didn't anyone at the manufacturing facility bother to check out the final product before they began shipping?

It is a shame that an otherwise fine collection has been marred by such shoddy packaging. If I had been aware of this issue, I would not have purchaased this set. I do not recommend that anyone buy this set until it has been reissued in a better package.",1267920000,79,2163,4.629242819843342

4014192,2,B002Z7FN7Q,"First things first, I greatly admire Clint Eastwood as an actor and director ,and he's been the major film star of my baby boomer lifetime.

I just picked this set up so I am reviewing as an OWNER , not someone who has read the contents and wants to prattle on about Clints career at Warners. I was sad to find that the discs are the notorious Flippers (a movie on each side) instead of the far more stable single sided discs. Given that many of these movies are already available for under 10 bucks each This is still a cheap way to buy all of his movies for anyone that is that big a fan but who doesn't already own them.. I'm  a bit confused as to who they are marketing to? I am a big fan and own many of these but thought it might be a great way to house films in a smaller package and looked forward to the documentary and the book etc..

Extras.... the documentary is only a 21 minute ""teaser"" for the real one due this summer and NOT 16x9 but letterboxed 4:3 wow..that's lame. They DO give you a web address and a code to get the whole documentary mailed out in the summer of 2010...but when you go to it, it says that address  either doesn't yet exist or has other troubles and come back later. Who knows what that is about...have so  many people bought this and tried to redeem that their server crashed...not likely, probably just more corporate stupidity  and ""I thought you had set that up"" finger pointing.

Book...is really a big nothing..tease for the real book in stores, and the pouch with a few photos ,again nothing special.

The Films...As I said, being that these are unstable ""flipper discs"" I am hesitant to get rid of the DVDs of the films I have and unlike some other multi disc sets I've recently purchased these will be scratched in removing and replacing for play...in fact you can NOT  remove them without putting your hands  on the surfaces of the discs (never recommended).

Bottom line, This isn't really something for a true fan who would be better off it seems only buying the Clint films one wants in either DVD or  Blu-Ray.  There is NOTHING here for true fans but for  somebody who  owns virtually none of his movies and suddenly wants to spend over a hundred bucks (that seems  a mutually exclusive notion) its a good value.

Were this released on Blu-Ray....I would be very happy and they would need not  deal with flippers due to the storage capacity of Blu-Ray....but we see no such release in the near future.

To summarize...I'd stay away if you are a big fan,  own the movies of CLints you already like and think this is some sort of ""Cadillac"" version..its more of a Pinto.",1266278400,300,2619,4.383022774327122
4014193,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"I remember noticing him in Rawhide when it showed on TV.  He had a presence, clean, youthfully laconic, wry and eminently watchable.  Who knew that he could bang out so many films that 34 in 35 years still leaves out about another 11.  Busy guy.  My guess is his work ethic and sense of honor, commitment and artistic drive have kept him at it.  I'm startled to see that in his late 70's he was able to make Gran Torino.  When I saw it I considered it to be his masterpiece, lean, insightful, an American experience and issues to consider.  What struck me was that not a moment in the film was wasted.  He cut to the bone.  Editing to the fine point of the film.  It's evident that he has chosen to live this way.  In a country in the grip of a weight problem he's kept himself and his movies lean.  I'm dyin' to show Gran Torino to my 84 year old dad for the excellent father theme.  It's darned handy that we can purchase Fistful of Dollars / For A Few Dollars More / The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Hang 'em High in a set on amazon and High Plains Drifter/Joe Kidd and Two Mules For Sister Sara in another.  I've never tried to collect all his movies but I'm darned tempted to get these three maybe with some of my tax refund.  I had my eye on Where Eagles Dare for the last few years and finally purchased the DVD recently.  Very satisfying.  Clever, adventuresome an Clint perfectly cast as the American cool headed assassin in virtually a suicide mission.  I'm sure hoping these films are in widescreen.  I've grown to love that format so I can actually see all that the director intended to be seen.  It's more theatre viewing experience.  Kelly's Heroes belongs with the films I enjoyed in high school, clever, funny, adventuresome and defiant.  Still a favorite.  His lean acting style, a grimace communicating his thoughts on a subject, fit right in with this ensemble war film but with a 60's attitude.  I like buying DVDs to see my favorites without a TV channel logo in the corner, to see when I wanna see them, say, maybe when I retire and to see films I've never viewed before that I think I'd like to see.  This box would accomplish that.  I know I'd like to see the first 3 Dirty Harry flicks again and would like to see the fourth.  I'd enjoy seeing The Outlaw Josie Wales again and would like to check out Honkeytonk Man.  My wife said Space Cowboys was good but I couldn't imagine a geratric space mission would make any sense at all.  Caught most of it on TV recently and there was a real story there.  Not bad at all.  I've wanted to see Bird and this would be the perfect opportunity.  Always had a thing for hardcore jazz.  I love buying my dvds used.  Amazon lets me do that because of the quality rating of the discs.  I get the same chance at local outlets.  If I can get a used movie for $5 or less I figure I'm doing well.  Cheapest typically is $3.  At the pre order price this box is less than four bucks a film.  That's economy I can live with.  I've probably seen fewer than half these films and might not want to see a handful of them.  It'd be great to have Letters From Iwo Jima.  The ol man was in WWII and I'm confident that Clint did an honor bound piece on the subject.  Really something to look forward to.  Clint is our generation's John Wayne, stoic, solitary, strong, confident, iconic, a figure that is recognized world wide as American.  But our generation's cuz he spread his wings, envelopes a core of friends on film, has a squint that questions the foolish things he sees some folks doin' or thinkin' and a moral compass that never bangs out an exploitation film, always has a message of commitment, honor and how to live life with your wits about you not scatter brained, even in his comedies.  I think I'm gonna break down and get this box after the price goes down with some used ones becoming available, not that I expect a lot of them to show up with so many films in the box.  Though I'm a fan I only own Where Eagles Dare and Mystic River and some episodes of Rawhide!  It says something about Mr. Eastwood that he would maintain this long running relationship with a movie studio.  Probably allows him to be so prolific.  In an era of people going company to company over the length of a career he's an example to us of what cultivating a long term working relationship can do.  He's like another of my favorite Americans, Frank Lloyd Wright who, career wise, was astonishing and worked the full length of his adult life deep into what most of us consider will be our retirement years.  We all have a gift.  Clint knows what his is.  He found his character range in film and has kept honing his craft so that his latest films are the fruit of continually working to be more efficient and to tell a story that asks to be told, that commonly enhances our lives by posing some moral questions.

[insert drum roll here]
  Coming on February 16, 2010: Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros., which the studio flaks are promising will be ""a salute to a true motion picture legend . . . the largest single artist box set ever.""
Were you expecting anything else from the studio who gushes Eastwood's ""illustrious motion picture career has spanned more than a half century and has touched generations of filmgoers."" And, oh yes, a man who's films have grossed nearly $2 billion at the domestic box office.
  The collection, considered the largest feature film box set ever released for a single artist, contains 34 Eastwood films from the Warner library, including ( of course, or you wouldn't reading this) the Dirty Harry movies. And please keep in mind that these are WB flicks only . . . no Paint Your Wagon here.
  The 35th film is The Eastwood Factor, an intimate short film from Time critic and film historian Richard Schickel, which, the flaks insist ""presents Eastwood in a way he's rarely seen---visiting film locations or sites where his movies were created, and on the Warner lot visiting the costume department and Eastwood Scoring Stage, as well as at his home. Eastwood's candid, intelligent and often humorous interviews about his body of work and the choices he made, along with Schickel's selection of scenes from his movies (including his upcoming Invictus), results in an up-close and personal portrait of one of the great icons of our era.""
  Here's the icon with one of his most famous co-stars:
  Adds Schickel: ""I've known Clint for most of the time he's been at Warner Bros. I was fortunate to be able to wander around the Warner lot with him and hear his reminiscences. To be able to show him in the places where he works and lives and feels most comfortable is, I think, a unique opportunity.""
  To make sure fans are willing to shell out the $179.98 for the set, a sampling of the documentary is scheduled to run ""on a minimum of 10,000 screens"" nationwide in the first quarter of 2010.
  To make sure things don't head south, the Eastwood event will coincide with the publication of a 288-page book (also from Richard Schickel), ingenuously entitled Clint: A Retrospective. The book will shine as example of cross-marketing: A 20-minute version of the full-length documentary will accompany each book.
  In a perfect world, all would be unforgiven.",1260489600,2,2526,4.785714285714286
4014197,5,B002Z7FN7Q,"Clint Eastwood has a long history with Warner Brothers that goes back forty years. You have to go back to 1975's Eiger Sanction to find a film he did not direct at the studio, and he only directed a total of five films in his entire career that were not made at Warner Brothers. Since Clint Eastwood's film career did not begin until long after the studio system died, this really is unique for a director and studio to have such a long relationship. As expensive as this set is, it is actually cheap per disc. That is because this is a repackaging of stock. Warner's is simply taking existing transfers and placing them in this set, mainly on two-sided discs. This can be somewhat annoying for those of us who have bought multi-film packages of Eastwood's Warner films.

I list all of the films below, whether Eastwood directed or starred or did both, and a short synopsis on the older films. If I do not mention him starring, that means he did not appear in the film as an actor at all.

Don't let that popular internet film database fool you with its ratings. People often rate some of Eastwood's lower key films poorly because they don't get what he was trying to do. If you come to ""Bronco Billy"" expecting Harry Callahan you'll be disappointed. If you come to it expecting a good film, then you won't be. I'd say this is a definite buy if you don't own any of Eastwood's films. If you do, it just depends on how many you own as to whether this big package deal is worth it.

Do be aware that 16 of the 19 discs included are dual-sided.
