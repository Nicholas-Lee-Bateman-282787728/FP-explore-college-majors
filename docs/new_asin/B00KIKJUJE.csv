8659238,2,B00KIKJUJE,"Note that in several of these operas you are not getting contemporary, up-to-date high-def recordings but archival, poor quality transfers of operas performed and recorded in the 1980s or thereabouts that have been ""upscaled"" onto Blu Ray disks. (The worst are the Sister Angelica and Johnny Sichi recordings, which are from the 1950s and unsubtitled, I believe.) In short, in about a third of these performances the images are fuzzy, poorly lighted, and low resolution. If you are listening to opera for the voices, there are some good moments to be had on the PCM tracks (same as CD quality), but if you expect anything resembling video recordings made in the past 20 years, you will (with three or four exceptions) be crest-fallen, as I was. (Note that the image of the album back on the Amazon listing page appears to be deliberately reduced in size to prevent you from reading the recording dates of a number of these productions. And beware of reviewers who don't reveal the age of many of these recordings. They are almost certainly employees of one of the companies that is selling this set, or devotees of antique performances.)",1513123200,2,1137,4.865979381443299
8659239,4,B00KIKJUJE,"The 12"" X 12"" box contains 11 DVDs in cardboard sleeves, and a large hardback book that discusses Puccini and his operas. Most of the included operas are available on Amazon individually. The operas are:

DISC 1: LE VILLI (3.0 stars)  2004
It is available here:

Most of the singing is good. The scenery and costumes support the story.

DISC 2: EDGAR (3.8 stars)  2008
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edgar/dp/B002JP9HIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edgar</a>
The singing approaches excellence. Acting was sometimes overdone, sometimes underdone.

DISC 3: MANON LESCAUT (4.2 stars)  1998
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Manon-Lescaut-Cura-Guleghina-Gallo-Roni-Berti-Banditelli-Mori-Bolognesi-Muti-La-Scala-Opera/dp/B000AMMSQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - Manon Lescaut / Cura, Guleghina, Gallo, Roni, Berti, Banditelli, Mori, Bolognesi, Muti, La Scala Opera</a>
Excellent singing, though not quite the very best. Scenery & costumes excellent.

DISC 4: LA BOHME (4.6 stars)  1988
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-La-Boheme-Freni-Pavarotti-Severini-San-Francisco-Opera/dp/B00003M5GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - La Boheme / Freni, Pavarotti, Severini, San Francisco Opera</a>
Excellent everything. Freni was absolutely oustanding. Pavoratti was a touch off his game, but still well ahead of most singers.

DISC 5: TOSCA (4.4 stars)  2006
Two editions are available:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tosca/dp/B0047VZ8WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tosca</a>
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TOSCA/dp/B005O3XXCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TOSCA</a>
Visual extravaganza in large outdoor arena with no curtains. Mostly excellent singing & acting.

DISC 6: MADAMA BUTTERFLY (4.2 stars)  1986
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madama-Butterfly/dp/B000GNOTZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madama Butterfly</a>
Singing was very good to excellent. Acting was sometimes stiff. The director and two female leads were Japanese. Scenery & costumes were excellent. The angry uncle descended from the sky with two assistants as if by magic.

DISC 7: LA FANCIULLA DEL WEST (3.9 stars)  2005
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-La-Fanciulla-del-West/dp/B0031O7UUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - La Fanciulla del West</a>
Performed outdoors. Singing ranged from very good to excellent. Fabio Armiliato as Dick Johnson had the best singing performance. Scenery & costumes supported the story.

DISC 8: LA RONDINE (4.4 stars)  2008
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-La-Rondine/dp/B001BLR73U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini: La Rondine</a>
Generally excellent singing and acting. Elegantly stylized costumes and sets from the 1950s.

DISC 9: IL TRITTICO (4.5 stars)  2007
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Il-Trittico/dp/B000TXY2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - Il Trittico</a>
Il Trittico is a collection of three one act operas that Puccini intended to be performed as a set. This version contains excellent performances. Amarilli Nizza is showcased as Giorgetta  in Il Tabarro, as Suor Angelica in Suor Angelica, and as Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi.

DISC 10: Turnadot (4.5 stars)  1983
Two editions are available:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Turandot/dp/B004TWOXH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini: Turandot</a>

Excellent everything. Carreras sometimes underacted, but his voice was excellent.

DISC 11: SCHWESTER ANGELICA & GIANNI SCHICCHI
I can't find this individually available on Amazon.

These are German versions of Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi presented as a historical bonus. No subtitles or closed captions are included. Both are black and white, and show their age.

Schwester Angelica was performed in studio in 1959. Sena Jurinac was Schwester Angelica. Argeo Quadri conducted the Weiner Philharmoniker.

Gianni Schicchi was performed live in 1960. Erich Kunz was Gianni Schicchi. Argeo Quadri conducted the Orchestra of the Volksoper Vienna.",1477267200,7,4790,8.11281070745698
