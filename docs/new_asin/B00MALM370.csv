6565686,5,B00MALM370,"I wanted to watch this because of my fascination with Ernest Hemingway, but what really touched me was the sincerity of the documentary.  This is not a case of a celebrity trying to regain some attention, but instead it is about a woman trying to make sense of her childhood, the complicated relationship with her father and sister, and a history of depression and suicide in the family.  I've dealt with depression on and off most of my adult life and this documentary made me feel as though I am connected to others in this world, in the present and the past.  A beautiful piece.",1414800000,6,581,4.514285714285714
6565687,5,B00MALM370,"This was a surprising documentary.  Unsparing, yet not gratuitus or pretencious.

I was always fascinated by Mariel and Margaux, and the mystique of the family legacy.  The shadow and mystery went deeper than I imagined.

This is also a very human and gracious treatment of the darkest of family secrets, and it's compassion is frequently very moving.

If you know much about this family, and the 2 famous Hemingway sisters, you will find this a fascinating and worthwhile film.",1414627200,,478,5.0
6565688,5,B00MALM370,"This is rare opportunity to view a secret that spans several generations.  One of the secrets the public is aware of and it deals with mental illness. The other secret is so traumatic that it only compounds the problems that involve the first secret.

It's a well documented story that follows family members through the many phases that go along with mental illnesses.

Another side effect that reveals itself in this documentary is the avoidance relationship that exist between Mariel and her sister. I wondered if the avoidance is due to the overall memory of family trauma; or did the avoidance enhance her ability to postpone telling her daughters of their family history of mental illnesses.

Nevertheless, this movie celebrates a combination of a life being lived regardless of any historical traumatic experiences.",1411603200,,822,5.157894736842105

Thanks to all the amazing contributing producers, directors etc..that created a wonderful film that opens up about mental health and suicide, a subject that is not talked about enough in today's society, as we face such hard times.  it is also difficult to understanding the core reasons of where suicide comes from regarding mental health.

6565697,4,B00MALM370,Such an amazing and tragic legacy Mariel Hemingway was born into.  She weaves the past and present together in a very cool way. The old footage of her sister Margaux was fascinating.  Mariel is definitely the healthiest of the family and shares her life story and how she has become the holistic advocate that she is.,1467590400,,317,4.642857142857143
6565698,3,B00MALM370,Interesting film. I too come from a family full of mental illness so it was enlightening to see how they dealt (or didn't) deal with it. The reason I didn't give it more stars is because Mariel's boyfriend drove me crazy! She should break it off with him if she hasn't already. He's so full of himself and pushes her around to do what he wants. I lost it when he jumped all over her when she accidentally ran over a rock and then he proceeds to be an idiot and intentionally wreck the car and she is supposed to be okay with it. WHAT A JERK. I would go crazy being around that ego-maniac.,1461024000,,588,4.121739130434783

I feel empathy, but we are all afraid",1454112000,,338,4.296875
6565702,5,B00MALM370,"I enjoyed this documentary for two reasons. Over the years I have read Hemingway's novels and was quite taken with them. I have come to understand him as a literary gift however also a dark man with a few demons. Secondly, I have also watched a few of my own loved ones suffer with mental illness over the years.

6565707,5,B00MALM370,"Poignant story, well received and appreciated. Mariel signed my tattered, first edition of the ""Old Man and the Sea"" this past Saturday, 8-15-15, at CSUN, where she was the keynote speaker for 'The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance"" (DSBA), a tireless advocate for those who are battling mental illness. She apologized to me for her apparent lack of writing skills, as though she felt I expected her to give an account on par with her famous grandfather, Ernest Hemmingway. Believe me, she is her own woman, sharing her personal life on the most intimate scale, allowing the viewer a candid and heart warming insight into her families lives, their strengths and weaknesses, personality conflicts and history of family suicide. I declare that she is a survivor, a warrior in the movement to help those individuals wondering the lonely landscape between acceptance and rejection. Ernest Hemmingway would have been very proud of his Mariel Hemmingway, not only for her compassion and relentless drive as an author and advocate, but for her bravery , a characteristic that he highly valued and incorporated into his novels.",1439856000,5,1125,5.1530054644808745
6565708,2,B00MALM370,"She's running from it but not getting that far.  And she is the least crazy of the bunch? In between clips of all of them making senseless remarks and dramatic faces regarding their history, their unhappiness, their addictions, here is non-crazy compulsively exercising. Seriously. She never stops not for one minute.  I'm still trying to figure out who it is exactly who cares about Hemingway.  I don't.  I care that they show animals being killed and abused for no reason other than stupidity. This is supposed to make them deep thinkers.  Serious. Profound.  It makes them a bunch of winos that like animal torture as entertainment.  From Papa (how many things are wrong with his whole entourage calling him that?).

6565713,4,B00MALM370,"Barbara Kopple is no first timer to making documentaries and she does her usual first rate directing job. The Hemingway family is seen through several perspectives. They liked using cameras so there is direct footage of most of them. The film hones in on grandfather Earnest, his oldest son, that son and his wife's three daughters: Muffet, Margaux and Mariel. There have been seven suicides in this family and Mariel is intent on preventing anymore from happening. She has two grown daughters, also seen in this film, and they too have suffered from depression which is a mental illness closely associated with suicide. Mariel has both strong and weak parts in the film. The weak parts were tangents into some other parts of her life which had little to do with these other main characters. The scene where she goes mountain climbing with her boyfriend and has car trouble was the weakest of these scenes. The most tragic figure in the film is her sister Margaux. There is a lot of footage of Margaux. She was initially the big beauty in the family and had a huge career as a super model. But Margaux had some big demons and as the footage unfolds it is easy to see her deterioration over a relatively short span of years. Ironically, Margaux becomes the star of this film, not Mariel. I enjoyed the film but some of the scenes involving Mariel needed more work. I enjoyed it overall and thought it was very good.",1432166400,,1414,4.637450199203188

6565723,4,B00MALM370,"I'm a fan of Mariel Hemmingway (from her role in Manhattan to her advocacy of balanced living), and was engrossed by this documentary. I ordered the film was because I remembered seeing a similar show that aired on television between 1999 and 2000. I was moved by the story back then, and would be very interested in finding out what program I saw (some of the footage was the same..does anyone remember this?). I imagine some of the footage was originally taken for Margaux's documentary about her grandfather (Earnest Hemmingway) which was never completed.

In Running From Crazy, Mariel offers valuable insights to her family's legacy of tragedies, shares her own coping/survival strategies, and admirably considers personal weaknesses.  Mariel tackles serious issues and dysfunction that so many families suffer to varying degrees. In addition to mental illness and addictions, I think some of the problems her family suffer also stem from the constructs of patriarchal society (which is so prevalent in the world war II generation). The causes and effects of these problems are examined in this documentary.  It's fascinating to watch the various Hemmingway personalities unfold (of Mariel and her sisters especially), and to glimpse the beauty, fortune, and wealth that also accompany their lives.",1425254400,,1303,5.315533980582524

6565726,3,B00MALM370,"Enjoyed learning about this family. We have all heard of them - read them, seen them in movies, but now there is a better understanding of what they are about. I appreciate that Mariel was so honest in presenting this. This took courage.",1424044800,3,237,4.534883720930233
6565727,1,B00MALM370,"Maybe I should find this interesting on the grounds that it gives a look at how the most spoiled and privileged people in history could become suicidally depressed but I can't get past this: The pioneering psychologist Abraham Maslow described a ""hierarchy of needs"" It can be pictured as a triangle. The base level is one's survival needs like food and shelter. The higher up one goes the more actualized they are. Many people never get off the base level focusing on meeting their survival needs. One can't focus on higher needs until the base ones are met. Its easy to understand how those people become depressed and suicidal.  To listen to such spoiled pampered people talk about anything without giving ample acknowledgement to how grateful they are for how lucky they are I find difficult. I haven't finished the movie. It will be a challenge.",1422921600,,850,4.821917808219178

6565733,4,B00MALM370,"Very, very difficult to watch. The awful laughter. In the family footage, when one sister or another interviews her father or other family member, they laugh and laugh inappropriately, to deflect their historical reality, confronting actual emotions. It's just awful. I had to stop watching, there was so much horrible laughter. We're talking some very self-absorbed people here. I'm bothered by Mariel's dedication to self-punishmentl, in a way - the freezing water, for example - almost like shock therapy. This is a depressing movie.

6565736,5,B00MALM370,Absolutely loved the film.  Mariel is a sweetheart. What an amazing person. She shows us real raw emotion and lets the viewer inside her family life.  Very interesting film.  I was so impressed with Mariel.  She gives an honest assessment of the trials of family and so many suicides.  We all have messed up families and she made you feel a part of her struggle.,1418342400,,362,4.507692307692308
6565737,5,B00MALM370,"Ernest Hemingway, Pulitzer Prize-winning American author of ""The Old Man and the Sea"" along with many wondrous works including the astounding, ""A Farewell to Arms"". When he wrote his novels, he explained to the public (paraphrasing his quote), 'There is nothing to writing; all you do is sit at your typewriter and bleed'. He ""lived hard and fast"", played with reckless abandon, and he went to the deepest level of despair. He also suffered the clutches of the darkest Major Depression then took his own life.

The youngest granddaughter of ""Grandpapa"", Mariel Hemingway offers her lifetime remembrances and an opinion of another American family fraught with more than its share of tragedy. Mentioning their American family along with the Kennedys in a quick comparison to legacies right off although does not expound on her viewpoint. She personally seeks to clarify the dark depression that has gripped the Hemingways throughout the years and talk openly about suicide prevention. The family lineage is fraught with Major Depression, her own father, Jack, suffered himself (I will leave the remainder of her father's issues to the film). That is followed by his three daughters, ""Muffet"", who appears to be suffering other disorders also and is presently an artist. The infamous Supermodel/actress and personality who led an always captivating, but tragically an equally haunted life, ""Margaux"", and the youngest who also has not been spared her own trials, ""Mariel"".

The documentary starts off with Mariel at her own home seeking balance for her mind, body, and soul. She slowly begins to explain the reasons she believes may be why the different incidences have happened to her own family and the results of those she does clarify. An intelligent woman in her own right with two grown daughters, quite different from each other, have both experienced the deep and dark place of depression. Langley, who goes her own creative way and along with her mother in her altruism, is artistic in personality and her other daughter, who has followed Mariel's older sister, Margaux (only in her career aspirations) as an ""It Girl"" fashion model. In interjected parts of the documentary, Mariel does talk with each of her daughters who have experienced the depression that at one point is hinted at as a curse. It is not a family curse, but a mental illness that follows down genetic family lines. Certainly, one who experiences it may feel this completely, as it is all encompassing in its grip. Langley and Mariel explain that until you have lived it, you will never really know it. The horrible clutching darkness of depression cannot thoroughly be explained without having been in the mire of it. It is impossible to just explain such an 'unable to escape it' feeling. Mariel is understandable about how she wishes to inform her own daughters about the family's lineage of Major Depression so dark that many people have taken their lives into their own hands. Mariel has become an advocate against suicide, and who better?

The documentary had me in tears many times. They were during the parts of the film that Margaux was experiencing the most reckless, tormented, and broken times. I remember her outward attitude of free-living back then although had no idea what was in store for me as far as Mariel's recounting of what had happened in their home. This shocked me. Things like this go on every day in the 'closest' of families. Of all of the daughters, what took me by heart was Margaux and her (to the world) stunning life. Their real story is within. Mariel tells of all the times she thought of her sister, Margaux, as being ""stupid"" and the pain and regret of her harsh statement shown brutally on her face. Apparently, there had been a rivalry amongst the sisters though Mariel's ability to be painfully honest more than shines a bright light facially on her own private pain.

I loved this documentary, directed by Barbara Kopple, for what it was able to show and to explain, also for its realism within their family unit. Mariel appeared to be much quieter than her other sisters back in their younger years. It actually does bring to the surface very much of Mariel's personal life in the present along with what she does on a daily basis for a lifetime of harmonious balance. Even now while mothering her own two lovely daughters, Mariel is trying to show the pain of suicide by telling her own personal haunting story, to individual people, families, and even to legacies. There is no difference in such a serious mental illness that would cause one to take their own life ...",1418169600,6,4589,4.894601542416453
6565738,3,B00MALM370,"Interesting documentary, full of insights into the Hemingway clan.",1418083200,,66,6.444444444444445
6565739,4,B00MALM370,"Disturbing, haunting, and perhaps more revealing that Mariel Hemingway realizes, this film tells the story of five generations of mental illness in the Hemingway family, from the father of Hadley (Ernest's first wife) to Ernest to his son, Jack, to Jack's daughters (Mariel, Margaux, and Muffet) to Mariel's daughters. All told: seven suicides that Mariel knows of. The stories include depression,  pedophilia, drug abuse, eating disorders, and likely other unmentioned/undiagnosed mental illnesses. There is footage of Jack, his wife, and their three daughters from the 1980s as well as recent footage of Mariel's current life and a visit to her sister Muffet.

All told this is a deeply distressing look at the lineage of Ernest and Hadley. As someone who was a teenager in the 1980s (just a bit younger than Mariel), is a lover if Ernest Hemingway, and avidly interested in mental illness, this was so difficult, so distressing that I cannot stop thinking about it.

Every person profiled is a train wreck, including Mariel who is presented as the strong one and who has now devoted her life to health and mental health advisement. Her boyfriend/business partner (""former stuntman"") is dreadful. He is controlling (and she seems subservient) and berates her until she cries (what does he do when off-camera?) Mariel says she wishes she could afford to take care of Muffet, though surely less wealthy people than Mariel Hemingway care for unstable family members. At least one of her daughters seems to have her own demons to fight. And the big bomb: Mariel tells the camera that her father Jack, Ernest Hemingway's *son*, sexually abused Mariel's two sisters. I wish the filmmaker had devoted more than 20 seconds of screen time to that.

A sad, sad great American family indeed. How fragile life and sanity are.

RIP Ernest, Margaux, and the rest.",1417910400,6,1851,5.055737704918033

6565741,5,B00MALM370,I remember the Hemingway girls when I was young I was so jealous of their life. I thought why couldn't I have had a life like that. Then I saw this movie and it broke my heart. We all have our own journey's and the grass isn't green on the other side. This was such a good movie/documentary. Everyone should watch this movie as its real life real pain and it touches on so many topics that everyone will find one to relate to.

6565742,4,B00MALM370,"I thought this documentary was pretty interesting to watch.  I wasn't that familiar with the Hemingway family and didn't know about the suicides or mental health issues in the family before watching it.

It didn't profess to have all the answers on how to deal with depression or suicidal thoughts, just showed how they were trying to learn from it and deal with it, still going through that process themselves.

It showed what a lasting impact sexual abuse can have on a family and the communication patterns that develop from it, even though the topic itself was probably covered for less than 5 minutes of the film.  The sisters were so competitive with each other and such an emphasis was put on their bodies and their beauty. It didn't seem like the sister bond was encouraged because of how much jealousy and eagerness to please existed among them.

I think a lot of emphasis was put on their depression/mental issues stemming from the family history of it but the reality is even without that being in their history, they'd still be struggling because of either being sexually abused by their father or witnessing their Dad do that.  They had the obvious love for him where he taught them to fish, lived in such a beautiful nature area and enjoyed those things...but the guy was in his daughter's bedroom at night and also they witnessed such a hostile relationship between the parents so balancing all that out in their heads would drive a person crazy even if it wasn't in the family history.

Random observation, I didn't like the way Bobby spoke to Mariel.  If he can act the way to Mariel on film (the scene where they have car troubles) who knows what he does behind closed doors or what little verbal digs he takes at her.  To me it felt like someone taking advantage of a person's triggers and vulnerabilities and like she didn't even realize it was happening.  She stood up to him for a second, but then she caved and he got his way even after talking to her that way.

I could have done without that horrible bull scene too even if it was supposed to be symbolic.",1417651200,3,2080,4.564516129032258

The only thing is that Mariel's boyfriend is a misogynist so it's hard to watch scenes with him in it.",1417305600,2,279,4.833333333333333
6565745,5,B00MALM370,"Running From Crazy examines the personal journey of Oscar-nominated actress, author, and mental health advocate Mariel Hemingway, granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway. The film follows Mariel as she strives for a deeper understanding of the suicide and mental illness that have afflicted many of her family members, including her supermodel/actress elder sister Margaux Hemingway, who committed suicide near the anniversary of Ernests own suicide, and her eldest sister, artist Joan Muffet Hemingway, who was diagnosed with manic depression.

Recalling a childhood framed by alcoholism, cancer, and misery, Mariel attends a support group for families of suicides, shown in the film: Knowing that theres so much suicide and so much mental illness in my family, Ive always kind of been running from crazy, worried that one day Id wake up and be in the same position. Personal footage and emotional interviews with Mariel are interwoven with rarely seen archival footage of the three Hemingway sisters and their parents. Directed by Barbara Kopple (Harlan County U.S.A., American Dream), this documentary underscores the human ability to rise above the sadness of the past and seek a better tomorrow.

There are no bonus extras on the DVD release.",1417046400,,1241,5.424870466321243

8671127,5,B00MALM370,"This is a life story of Mariel Hemingway and dealing with personality disorder in her family.  She is honest and up front with the illness that is within her family. It would be good for someone going through this type of situation and to learn from it. I only hope that some people would seek some professional help or counseling before they end it all or get them some help. Life goes on no matter what, the scenic is so beautiful, I believe it is in Idaho, Camas country and once the land of the Nez Perce Tribe. So many beautiful places to enjoy just hiking. I also really enjoyed her acting in the movie ""Steal the Sky"" with Ben Cross, a great movie too.",1533081600,,659,4.272
