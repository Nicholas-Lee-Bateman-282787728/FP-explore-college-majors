6440552,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef is a straightforward story, which is told in an engaging and appealing way.

The star- Jon Favreau- also wrote and directed the movie. His character- a celebrity chef who falls from grace, then rebuilds his life- is appealing, sympathetic, believable, and most importantly: genuinely funny.

The story comprises several themes:

1. Confrontation between the artistic creative chef (Jon Favreau) and his conservative employer about whether to serve adventurous or conservative cuisine
2. A verbal ""pie fight"" between the chef and a fussy food critic
3. A father disconnected from his son
4. A road trip, where the chef rediscovers his creative roots and reconnects with his son
5. The chef discovers reinvigorated creativity

From these ingredients, Mr Favreau cooks up an entertaining feel good light comedy.

There are good cameo appearances from Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr.

Sofia Vergara appeals as the chef's ex wife.

While the story is simple and straightforward, it is told in an engaging and charming fashion, with a good dose of light humor.

The food scenes are gorgeous: apparently Mr Favreau did his own cooking after training from road truck chef Roy Choi - watch the closing credits!

Also, look out for the animated Twitter tweets- an interesting story telling technique.

This is an entertaining movie with broad appeal- well worth a look!

6440553,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Jon Favreau's CHEF is a medium-well serving of delicious, snappy humour, emotion, culture, and oddball circumstances that are altogether enticing and light-hearted. It is like if Ratatouille (or Remy) meets Anthony Bourdain with the musings of a Guy Fieri Food Network TV show and Chef Nobu's culinary adventures. But all those comparisons just are not enough to tell you the whole package this film serves on a platter.

The story takes you into the rise-and-fall of a haute couture separated/divorced chef from Los Angeles and how a food critic and blogger eventually ruining his instilled pride of cooking at this gastronomy in turn to try to dwindle down and cook Cuban food over in Los Angeles.

While not a lot is going on in the film, its simplicity and familiar culinary curiosity is what keeps the film alive and Favreau's snappy, New York-ish wit and banter which is reminiscent of his work found in Swingers and even Elf lives up to its potential...and then some more with humorous cues from John Leguziamo (who plays Favreau character's side chef) and Robert Downey, Jr. making a cameo. The RDJ and small time Scarlett Johansson cameo scenes are significant given Favreau's work on high-stakes projects like Iron Man 1 and 2. The Twitter scenes are real stealers too and, while it could be seen as another means to do product-placement like The Internship or LEGO Movie, serves as an effective tool to showcase how that kind of medium is important within the business realm.

It also has a great and lively soundtrack full of music ranging from funk, soul, Cuban music, and a Latin American-inspired rendition of Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing which only serves to make a rather melodic experience that is befitting to the almost tantalizing imagery of the cooking, something that Anthony Bourdain would surely call out and say it is adult entertainment but with food instead of women.

However, all the praise doesn't necessarily mean the film is perfect as the film can feel a bit too promising and light-hearted for its own good. The failure aspect is there and the moments of guilt don't detract from the film's moderate, not outrageous comic nature but its the sometimes ""yay"" factor could be its occasional disadvantage. Also, was it really all that necessary to show a child actor drinking beer or spraying starch powder?

All-in-all, in a summer full of franchise fare and a dire year for comedy, Chef is refreshing, fun, lively, and sometimes appropriately light-hearted for its own good. It is an R-rated film with heart, brains, and a tendency to not be too sensational or gross.",1402272000,6,2600,4.926940639269406

There were some very touching scenes which put the hugest grin on my face and made me feel good. Well written and a tour de force for the main actors; Favreau, Vergara, Leguizamo, and the cute kid whose name now escapes me. Well done guys.",1529971200,,387,4.6231884057971016
6440570,5,B00KQTGWPC,My husband and I love this movie.

I really had no idea what to expect but it left me smiling when it was over. This isn't riveting, suspenseful, high drama stuff. Just a good story about a man having a bad time of it and how he finds his way back to a place of fulfillment and happiness. His son, ex-wife and a couple good friends help him get there. You're not getting a deep movie here that will leave a dent, but it's a lovely story that leaves you feeling like maybe the world isn't such a horrible place.",1528502400,,577,4.115044247787611
6440576,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Unnecessary & frequent use of ""F---"" plus some crude guy jokes about anatomy ,as well as Marvin Gaye's song ""sexual healing"" sung enthusiastically in the presence of a 10 yr old boy makes this movie rated R & that's all, cause it easily could have been a G family movie.
Stellar cast: R.Downy Jr, Oliver Platt,Dustin Hoffman,etc add class to a movie with heart. Good acting,enthusiastic soundtrack & a happy ending.
It's kind of a buddy movie, without being dumb & crude.",1528070400,,471,4.7560975609756095

Nothing surprising in the story but it was filled with passion and individuality as the chef battles conformity and the stifling demands of a boss that doesn't ever want to change.  I've watched it twice and will probably watch it at least a few times more simply because it is full of creativity and the bonds shared between family and friends.",1527206400,,510,4.644444444444445

6440589,1,B00KQTGWPC,"I rarely, if ever, write reviews. I thought this was going to be a fantastic film. There were a few touching moments between father and son. As a single dad I'm a sucker for, these type of plot lines. That being said the film was very dull and slow paced. The ending was unexpected in the sense that there was no ending. I was waiting for the next scene until the credits rolled. Maybe I have gotten used to longer productions such as a series where characters are far more developed. This film felt like the first few episodes of season 1 of a new series. Completely underwhelmed, especially considering the undeserved praise this film has gotten. It wasn't that bad just extremely overrated.",1526947200,,693,4.596774193548387

6440598,4,B00KQTGWPC,"What makes the movie work is that you genuinely like the kid and the Chef.  What I also liked about the movie is that the drama scenes are kept to a minimum.  Just enough to tell the story.  The movie gets up on a high note in the middle of it and the movie stays there till the end.  I kept thinking the director was going to ruin the high note by derailing the story line but it stays good ... . .The story is about a father and son getting to know each other.

The movie also has a lot of good actor cameo's peppered throughout it",1526342400,,533,3.8981481481481484

6440663,3,B00KQTGWPC,Annoying at times because the decisions some of the characters made were without any logical reasoning. If one of the biggest food critics in the world is coming to your restaurant for a second time in week and this time is expecting better+different food there isn't a manager in the world that would/could tell his star chef to cook a shitty meal like last time.. yet that is what happens and leads to a 2 hour long movie.

At this very moment I'm at a crossroads where I had a job offer to work some dead-end gig that would make me some good money but eat away at my soul and I decided not to take it, even though I'd already quit my other job for this one. So now I'm in this stressful but actually happy stage of my life where I'm figuring out what I really want to do and even though it does get really hard sometimes this movie portrayed so well a lot of the feelings I'm having and gave me hope (don't worry, I know it's fictional, I'm not going to go to chef school and start a food truck) for the future.

This movie reignited that passion and it is now stronger than ever. I have also always loved Cuban and tropical foods and this movie fuels that passion. I also love that Jon Favreau actually learned how to cook for this film. It makes this film even more exciting. I think that this film should get everyone excited about cooking and the different flavors you can get from so many different foods. Also, I love that they used the farmers market in this film. That is one of the best places to get the best quality raw food anywhere in the world is a farmers market.

Well, I first heard about it through a meme online, so I started watching it thinking it was just going to be another meme movie, boy was I wrong. From the moment you see Jon Favreau is 'his' kitchen, you understand, this man's got passion for 2 things; Food and Movies.  And he's damn good at both. The character development and dialogue may be lacking in some aspects, but what really pulls it up their to being one of the best movies ever made, is the amount of dedication Mr. Favreau has put in to learn the cooking skills in his every day to day life, not just for the screen time.

No need for an overt amount of drama to make an honest portrait  of the American dream; do what you love, love what you do. Many of the films released last year were heavy social commentaries on the current state of the culture and Chef continues this trend. Its no mistake that director, writer, and lead Jon Favreaus follow up to Iron Man and Iron Man 2 (a blockbuster which audiences adore Robert Downey Jr. who maintains perfect control over his technology), is a low key film in which Favreau himself plays a man with no understanding of Twitter, yet evolves into a internet fad.",1514419200,,701,4.519685039370079

The music is top notch and the element of father son bonding very refreshing to see on film.  Too often, fathers are portrayed as a-holes or incompetent drunks but this portrayal of a father committed to his family is a welcome departure from the trash that hollywood often releases.  Some plot elements were a bit too convenient but it wasn't reason enough for a lower score.  I've always enjoyed Jon Favreau's films from The Big Empty to Iron man. Chef is no exception.

Yes, it's an independent film, and no, it's not buffed to a high gloss like a Marvel film. But it is very real, and very satisfying. Combines both laughs and heartfelt moments. Great cast telling a great story, so you may not even notice the one or two places where it lags. This is one of those sleeper films that ends up being a big hit.

There are so many predictable films out there these days, but Chef is a refreshing taste of real life - it's passionate and inspirational, but shows that it sometimes takes a lot of hard work and dedication to pick yourself back up after a fall. Would be a family film if it wasn't for the language, so probably not suitable for your kiddos, but for everyone else, we definitely say Watch it!  Passion, beauty, culture, life, and a visual feast of cuisine! And along the way, some healing of the heart.",1509840000,,600,4.357142857142857

Acting fell into comfortable roles without anyone really extending themselves (except perhaps Martin). Language may it inappropriate for children who might have liked it. Although shallow in many ways, the story, the cities, and the food held my interest to the end. I also liked the star power just playing regular people without fanfare.

I am not usually influenced by food shows, but boy, honey, this little flick was uplifting and a great brief introduction into what really matters in life..

I was ok with that (although I would not watch it with my kids), but the story just drags and strays off-focus constantly. There are long scenes that don't contribute anything to the story and were just boring (the music video-type scene in Miami, the meeting between the two ex-husbands, etc.). I thought the idea of the story was cute and funny if a bit cliche. The execution made it uninteresting to me.

6440839,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Sometimes you just need a feel good movie to get you through your day. There's nothing to challenge your palate here, no sweetbreads, no calves brains, but Favreau and John Leguizamo have such great chemistry it's a lot of fun to watch. I like authenticity, they all talk like real cooks, and it appears Favreau has actual skills in the kitchen. It's doubtful that was CGI. And the all star cast was amazing: Favreau called in some major favors with this one. Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Sofa Vergara, Oliver Platt were all terrific, and Bobby Cannavale played an opportunistic Sous-chef to the hilt.

***Spoiler Alert***
The fact that other than the chef meltdown at the beginning there was no dramatic tension might be off-putting to cinema fans. Too much good, not enough suspense or falling down, but occasionally it's good to watch a story where after the set back at the start of the film things go well for the characters. Favreau could have had a major disaster with the truck on the road trip across the country, or there could have been some confrontation with his son (played  by Emjay Anthony in a solid performance), but Favreau decided, ""nah"" lets just tell a fun little story about cooks having a great time and leave it at that.

It's not a story that will fill you up, but it sure tasted good going down.",1506902400,6,1331,4.6553191489361705
6440840,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I really liked this movie for a number of reasons. First, the father and son interaction reminded me of my close relationship with my own father. We spent a lot of time together and often worked side by side. Emjay Anthony, who plays the son is an incredible actor in that he was on camera for long periods of time and had some complicated fast paced scenes. Second, it was as if Jon Favreau told his actor buddies that he was writing, staring in and directing a movie and they all asked to be in it. Actors who usually are stars and carry movies seemed happy to take bit parts and not overact. Scarlett Johansson kept her attractiveness under wraps. Sofa Vergara as hard as it is to believe gave an understated performance. Still latin. Still hot, but more mother and supportive cheerleader than an object of men's desire. John Leguizamo was the friend everyone wishes they had. Funny at times, reflective at others but always on your side. Finally there is the food, music and scenes from Miami, New Orleans and Austin. Also thought that social media was used as a vehicle to convey a message and not, as it often has become, a story-line crutch.

However, with that all said, if strong language, especially when spoken by a preteen bothers you, be aware that this movie has its moments. The young man is often treated like an adult so the language is not out of character for the roles. But, it still might be a bit strong for some people's liking.",1506816000,,1451,4.517110266159696

6440842,5,B00KQTGWPC,"In a world where movie plot lines have become trite or predictable and so much time and energy has been spent in space or or fantasy, this movie is one of the best that I have watched in a very long time. The human element is not only present, but is raw and real. The main character, played by Jon Favreau, faces problems that most of America is facing today - either a job that a person does but may not love, a job that a person lovse but cannot make one's own, or having no job at all and wondering where food/shelter/money is coming from next. The little truths of job purpose, family connections, and the desire for a father to be in his child's life radiate through a script making it surprisingly funny in the face of the harsh realities this film tackles. The dialogue and the stark virtual role that influences the lives of America are poignant and worth every giggle it sparked.

I love food. I love stories about people who pursue truth, family and purpose. I love happy(ish) endings and this film ends with me wishing it hadn't and so glad I can watch it again.",1506816000,2,1074,4.343283582089552

Movie shows the relationship between a son and father working on developing a food truck business after the father loses his job as an executive chef.  The chef's wealthy ex-wife who was still good friends with  her ex husband could have helped her ex husband start up a new business from the start, but she made her ex-husband re-establish himself with a food truck business.  It would have made more sense if the ex wife was not independently wealthy or that she was more of an adversary towards him than a best friend to her former husband.",1505606400,2,589,4.634615384615385

6440942,5,B00KQTGWPC,"It took me a long time to click play - why did I wait so long? While I feel the ""Chef"" movie theme has been overdone (no pun intended) in the past five years - this movie is really fun. For those that love chef shows this won't disappoint, but it is more than a show about a chef. The location shots in Miami, New Orleans, and Austin Texas are great, and the music is also a big part of what makes this so much fun to watch. Also the theme of relationships, and family are not too sappy. Everyone turns in great performances - Jon Favreau (Chef) has some gorgeous women in his life - Sofia Vergara, and Scarlett Johanssen both look fabulous.

If you've been skipping past this one (like I did) - give it a chance. It hooks you in the first few minutes, and is very compelling to watch.",1504224000,,785,4.130718954248366

I was looking for a wind-down movie at the end of the evening that didn't have a lot of action and one that I didn't have to decipher and landed on this. It's a story about a Chef and a food truck, but the deeper layer involves being true to who you are and what makes you happy, as well as a story about relationships (particularly parent-child). The acting is excellent and Jon Favreau is phenomenal, all the way down to his impressive knife skills (I later researched and learned that he went to France to train for those). I also really enjoyed Oliver Platt's brief appearances as the food blogger. It bumped it up to 5 stars for me when I learned that Chef Roy Choi, an early founder of the food truck movement, was involved in this.",1503792000,8,780,4.3493150684931505

Over half way through before he gets the truck & there weren't really any mis-adventures after he did. That part was a bit utopian, but perfectly fine without any mishaps for the food truck trio. They did a good job of developing his character's change. It wasn't really a forced change. Movies could have ended with a shot somewhere in there of the old restaurant shuttered & for sale.

It is a feel good movie that ends in mom and dad getting remarried. While a ""happy"" ending it is one that is exceptionally rare in real life. The father becomes the perfect dad, the mom is the perfect supportive ex-wife, the friend is the ultimate wingman. The script feels recycled from circa 1997-2001 disney family television. It is a family movie. Unless your family happens to be divorced. I remember watching movies like this as a kid. With divorced parents. It makes you believe in what truly is the impossible. It is a feel good story don't get me wrong. But one that would have made more sense a decade ago. Substitute twitter for ""internet"" and blogging.",1503446400,,851,4.635761589403973

I've found that John Leguizamo adds a lot to any cast so I knew it would all be palatable... (ha ha). Dustin Hoffman as the heavy seemed miscast, and the Robert Downey segment didn't add much either. I liked the way that the kid's tweeting talents to directly help his cause were woven into the story. Passionate restaurant people will enjoy it more than others.",1503360000,,659,4.681034482758621

Starting from scratch never tasted so good  - ""Chef"" tagline

Five CHARMING Stars. Chef is an enjoyable, fast-moving, unpretentious, feel good dramedy. Jon Favreau of Iron Man fame co-produced, wrote, directed, and stars in It. In the plot, a divorced, dedicated, talented chef rules the roost at a local popular restaurant but he yearns to produce his own cutting-edge culinary creations. When an influential food critic shows up, the movie takes off and becomes very social media savvy and very irreverent, with an underlying theme of family relationships and mobility. Bolstered by a lively latin music and blues music soundtrack, it features a great cast of Favreau, John Leguizamo, Sof&iacute;a Vergara, Bobby Cannavale, Emjay Anthony, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris, with Dustin Hoffman and Robert Downey Jr., featuring Jose C. Hernandez, with Roy Choi, Gary Clark, Jr., Nili Fuller, and Russell Peters. Highly Recommended. Five HUMOROUS Stars. (Universal Studios. Open Road Films. Rated R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

The observation is that the boy, who looks to be about 12, is in manifest violation of the child labor laws in force everywhere in the US.

On to the review...this is a feel good movie with a lot of heart and soul. It encompasses a slew of emotions, from laughing, heartbreak, angst, hope and finally pure joy. The cast and acting feel human and not 'acted' like so many stars do. Everyone in it feel as though they could be your friends, your neighbors, or anyone with a culinary love of food. It is a definite must see in my opinion, and I am sure I will watch this movie many times.",1502409600,,674,4.265625

The storyline is about a chef and his talents as he transitions from a restaurant to a food truck. It's fun and captivating plot entertains and leaves you feeling good. No downers here!

If it wasn't for the language, I'd say it's a great family movie but if you ever worked in a kitchen, you'll understand the profanity. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1502150400,3,599,4.495412844036697

6441085,4,B00KQTGWPC,"This is a fun movie, especially given all the reality cooking shows on TV now and the popularity of food trucks.  A chef follows his dream after quitting his steady job when his boss insists he keep the same old menu instead of flexing his creative muscles. There is a food truck road trip where  he forms a close bond with his son, and a funny public rivalry with a food critic (who is his nemesis) which plays out on Twitter.  This movie is rated R likely for an incidence of marijuana use, some crude language and crude jokes but there is no nudity and no sex scenes.  Even if the plot is a bit predictable it is still enjoyable in my opinion.",1501977600,,646,4.227642276422764

There are so many messages in Chef that it is hard to nail down one or two but  here goes:
This move clearly shows us that there are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more, the other is to desire less... G.K Chesterton

Chef also teaches you is how incredibly important family is, and how we all need to find what we are passionate about and makes us happy, and pursue it with your whole heart.

I'll be watching this many, many more times I can promise you that!",1501977600,,707,4.021428571428571

It's an okay film. although very corny in the father / son relationship and with a lot of dopey musical and cooking sequences that most people will be fast forwarding through. And NO ONE appreciates producers who hire actors with doofustoos up one side and down the other to parade in front of our children.

The acting appeared bland with the exception of the food critic who actually played his part well.  The dynamic between Chef, his son and his exwife was a bit odd to me.

One regret: I wish there had been a longer road trip. It was so cool to visit the different areas and their cuisines!",1501286400,6,782,4.843283582089552

6441127,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Love this movie!  Jon Favreau wrote, directed and starred in this lovely, lighthearted story of redemption.  Some family and work drama, lots of laughs, good Cuban music.  He must have owed Robert Downey, Jr. a big favor for the unnecessary bit part he gave him.  I couldn't wait to eat a Cuban sandwich each and every time I've watched this.",1499385600,,342,4.65
6441128,5,B00KQTGWPC,Good movie with spice as the main ingredient.,1499040000,,45,4.75
6441129,5,B00KQTGWPC,Just the perfect movie for the passionate... The people who cook and love life and family.,1498521600,,90,4.6875
6441130,3,B00KQTGWPC,"This could have been a great family film. Great idea, great acting, great casting. But the film falters with unnecessary drug use, sex references, and foul language that adds nothing to the plot interest. And no, I'm not religious, so it doesn't offend me for that reason. The movie could have been terrific, had it passed through the hands of a good editor. Poor Robert Downey''s scene should have been deleted, as it adds nothing supportive to the back story. The plot takes so long to develop, that it almost lost me -- and I'm usually a very patient person. Jon Favreau is top notch; he just needed a good film and dialogue editor to bring out this gem and let the great stuff really shine.",1498176000,,694,4.515873015873016

6441133,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Hmm self-indulgent in the extreme.  Scarlett Johansson dating a 50 yr old, Jon Favreau looking, broke chef is not OK. Sof&iacute;a Vergara is at least closer in age but also ridiculously over-attractive for the part. The movie is inexplicably long and unbalanced and takes forever to get through the setup. And why does a celebrity chef not have enough money saved up to open his own food truck???",1496534400,,397,4.838235294117647

6441136,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I watch the movie a couple of times and had to buy it.  The idea of getting back to basics of what you love to do is inspirational.  Jon Favreau has worked with some of this cast before and they appear to be having fun with the movie not working a job, and for me, that makes the story more enjoyable.  Maybe they are just good actors ;) The movie has some great songs as well that resulted in 2 soundtrack CDs",1494547200,2,410,3.975609756097561

6441156,5,B00KQTGWPC,It's a great foodie movie but it has more than just that and in some ways it focused more on other things than it did on food. It mostly focused on a Chef trying to become more of a family man and finding a bond with his son through cooking and through social media.,1488153600,,266,3.9444444444444446

6441162,5,B00KQTGWPC,"An entertaining movie with many layers to ""chew on"" if you're in a mood to do so. On its surface, Chef provides its audience with two hours of humor, food, and one man's journey to cook food ""he believes in"". However, delve into the movies many layers and subplots, you will also find a film that shows our universal, human struggle to be heard, to be listened to, to be understood. The ramifications of what we say and how we listen are dramatically shown through the evolving relationship between Casper and his son, Percy. What we say and how we listen is also humorously shown through the film's use of social media. A++, I'm ""hungry"" for more great acting and writing like Chef.",1486598400,2,683,4.560975609756097

6441231,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Just watched this movie and it is so good to see a really great movie with a wonderful cast with a lot of heart. Jon Favreau wrote, directed and stars in this great movie. It basically is about a chef in a high end restaurant who finds himself caught between what he really loves and going through the motion. He finds himself opening a food truck, sounds simple but it is how and what happens in between that makes this movie so good. It seems like each cast member was made for this role. I spent most of my working life in restaurant management and worked with some of the best over the years and I loved this movie and you can get it right here at Amazon my choice for music, movies and other stuff.",1476748800,3,703,4.176470588235294

6441255,5,B00KQTGWPC,I loved this more so much that I saw twice at the movie theater and I bought the sound track.  It is one of the best feel good movies out.  So good that I bought an extra one for a friend.  If Jon Favreau had his own food track I would drive for miles to eat what he is cooking.,1474070400,,278,3.6
6441256,4,B00KQTGWPC,Although a melodramatic starting course to set the mood this film is overall a superb representation of the life of an actual chef. Well worth the time and effort to watch this movie if you're in the mood for a field day (cubanos and Cabeza). This flick is perfect for the young at heart 20-50 year old adult who has lost their direction in life and needs a little inspiration to find their path again. The women in this movie are femme fatale types and most of the men are realistic representations of what time does to the human psyche. It takes what's marinating deep inside of your mind and plates it for the rest of the world to see.,1473984000,,638,4.325

Yes, I also like movies where you have to suspend your disbelief such as SUPER 8. But CHEF fits that truly special category of BEGINNERS and TWO FAMILY HOUSE and all the other surprising films where the characters take center stage rather than the action and leave me thinking about the people long after I saw the movie.

This is the most fun I've had in a long time just watching a movie. I then ran it through again to listen to the commentary. That is very good too. Tonight I popped it back into my machine and watched it again.
 If you like cooking type films, this will satisfy your craving for some fine cooking action. The story line is top - notch and the music track will get your blood flowing. I came out of watching this feeling revitalized and ready to get going on things I've been letting go for a while. Scarlett Johansen is sooo pretty here. She stole my heart.

6441317,1,B00KQTGWPC,"It's not often that a film appears so unpleasant, slackly plotted and poorly characterized that one yearns for it to end.

This is certainly the case with CHEF. The plot is straightforward, not to say predictable: Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) has a dust-up with his boss (Dustin Hoffman) as well as a supercilious restaurant critic (Oliver Platt) and leaves his restaurant. He sets up a food truck and by doing so reconciles himself to his estranged family, especially son Percy (Emjay Anthony).

The major snag with Favreau's film is that his central character comes across as a boor; the kind of person to run away from as soon as possible. Foul-mouthed, narcissistic and clumsy, he seems entirely unsuitable for his chosen vocation. Even the supposedly cordon bleu dishes he cooks seem uninspiring, full of cloying sauces designed to obscure rather than bring out the taste of his basic ingredients.

The script, supposedly described as comic, proceeds in a series of fits and starts, punctuated by curses from all the characters. The guiding principle seems to be this: - if you can't get a laugh by saying the f-word once, then repeat it four or five times so as to browbeat viewers into smiling.

The plot is wearily sentimental; we can see what's coming from about half an hour into this 114-minute movie. Perhaps the best advice is to turn it off and go cook for oneself; it would be far more satisfying.",1467763200,4,1409,4.809917355371901
6441318,5,B00KQTGWPC,"We may play it so much that the disc will wear out.  True gem of a film.  The version with the commentary is extraordinarily thorough, entertaining, illustrative and just good fun.  Highly recommend this film.",1467676800,,209,4.914285714285715
6441319,2,B00KQTGWPC,"I had to give it a two on this. 1st. At a glance I never really understood what the ex-wife did to get her bankroll. 2nd. By the end of the movie, I forgot Scarlett was even in it. 3rd. John Leguizamo just got Sous chef status then says ""I heard your voice and I had to come running."" That line normally is used for ""Booty Calls"". 4th. If your coming from Magazine St. in New Orleans, WHY IN EL JEFE'S NAME DO YOU CROSS LAKE PONCHARTRAIN TO TAKE I-12 JUST TO GET BACK ON THE 10 TO GET TO AUSTIN! On a non fuel economy truck, that's a colossal waste of gas! 5th. It almost seemed that this movie was more about the power of Twitter then the actual chef or even the food. And lastly, it seems like EVERYTHING IS IMPLIED! Did the couple get back together? If they did, it was kinda forced.

The reasons I give it two is the Kid acting like a normal kid playing on twitter, and YOU NEVER GIVE EL JEFE 1 STAR! I did have a good laugh after is realized the movie was flawed and looked at it the same way I looked a Eddie Griffin movies. ""So bad that I have to laugh.""",1467504000,,1061,3.957943925233645

6441322,4,B00KQTGWPC,"This took awhile to get into, but if you stick with it for the first 30 minutes, it is a very good feel-good movie. A chef (Jon Favreau) wants, like all artists, to create. He wants to create new dishes for customers to enjoy, but is stifled by the owner of the restaurant (Dustin Hoffman!). Eventually, after a bad review, he tangles his life up in such a way that he is ousted from his position in that restaurant. The movie really begins to take off from this point. This movie shows the power of love: parent and child, friend to friend, and more. It is fully of sterling performances by some very well-known actors in roles we don't expect. By movie's end, I just wanted to sigh and say ""Yes!"".",1467244800,,699,4.343511450381679

This movie has a delicious story with an overflowing basketful of culture, as well as, very talented, well seasoned actors. Heart warming moments and hilarious moments, some that made me so embarrassed for the main character, Carl, I wanted to turn away from the screen. Jon Favreau's range and talent was a surprise to me.

I liked the gutsiness of Carl, in insisting to be creative and innovative with his passion for food and cooking, despite what was safer for his livelihood.  Jon Favreau was excellent and believable in conveying the emotional anguish of choices and defending his cuisine.  The adventure with his son, ex-wife, and friends with a refurbished food truck evolved into a close family relationship, responsibility taught to a child, and parenting taught to his father (all implied, of course.)  If you're looking for realism, this isn't it.  The refurbishing of the truck alone was like a Cinderella story, with real people working the magic of the mice and birds and squirrels in no time at all.  And there is the happy ending, too.....not Disney, but close enough for me.",1458777600,,793,4.880597014925373

It is so well acted that it could almost have been a really well done documentary. It has heart and the characters are as real as it gets.

6441450,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Written and directed by Jon Favreau, this is a pleasant, entertaining, redemption story.  Favreau plays a Los Angeles chef at odds with his restaurants owner.  The chef feels as if hes in a rut and wants to try new things; the owner wants to go with the tried and true.  The chef thinks about food as art; the owner thinks about the number of covers and the bottom line.

A contretemps with a food critic blows the chefs world apart and he returns to Miami, where he made his reputation.  With the help of his ex-wife and her financier ex-husband, the chefs best friend and 10 year-old son, a rattletrap food wagon is rehabilitated, repainted and put back into service.  After initial success in Miami the team heads west, stopping in New Orleans for beignets, Texas for barbecue and, eventually, Los Angeles.

The chef (Spoiler) puts his business back together, puts his family back together and finds himself happy, once again.  He even strikes a deal with the food critic.  They bury the hatchet and start a new restaurant.

Normally I wouldnt reveal this much of the plot, but the movie is (thankfully) completely predictable and endlessly heartwarming.  It takes its energy from the performances, particularly the performances of a succession of A-list supporting actors (Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Scarlett Johansson, Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, et al.)

With all of the foodie movies on offer these days, this is the pure, feel-good, pitch-perfect dramedy.  One issue: its rated R for language.  While kitchen staffs are notoriously politically incorrect and salty in their language, this was an issue that could have been avoided.  In some ways this is a childrens movie; the central consciousness if you will is that of the 10 year-old son.  The good news is that the salty talk is probably nothing that a junior high school student today would find unfamiliar.",1454284800,,1876,4.926751592356688

CHEF is a hilarious star studded (Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Robert Downey Jr. with up and coming actor, Emjay Anthony) movie about not letting anyone drive the train of your dreams.  Jon Favreau (writer, director and producer) played Chef Casper who is a phenomenal chef but he allowed the owner of a trendy restaurant to squelch his creativity.

Chef Casper had been known as a trend setter that created unique mouth-watering foods that teased the palate.  When a well-known food critic was scheduled to come to the restaurant to see what Chef Casper was cooking up next he had to make a decision to either go with what the owner of the restaurant wanted him to prepare for the critic (which was the standard menu that had been prepared for years) or go with his instinct.  If you want to experience a fun, compassionate and warm movie while getting inspiration CHEF is ideal.",1449360000,,988,4.857142857142857

It's not like movie of the decade but fun to watch.
Jon Favreau was doing his part very well. He was a charming guy through the movie.
There are a lot of things to watch but besides that, the relationship with dad and the son, Chef and the critic, father and mother,..so on. They are all so fun to watch.
There are some moments that I felt like what am I watching? A movie about making foods? But hold on. It was not too bad. It was bearable.,
The director was Jon Favreau who made IRONMAN.He knows what he's doing.
Just trust me and watch this one.

John Leguizamo absolutely killed it, and Sofa Vergara was outstanding as well.  The plot is played out, fractured family, father suffers damage to his reputation, father engineers turn around, family rebounds YAY!

That being said the acting was refreshing and that led to a thoroughly enjoyable movie that I think you will enjoy watching.  The scenes that focus on cooking are outstanding, I hope you all enjoy watching this movie as much as we did!",1447200000,2,555,4.872340425531915

6441702,2,B00KQTGWPC,"Oh gord.  So disappointed.  Character development is replaced by characters simply announcing how they feel and what they think.  It is a movie devoid of subtlety, art or grace.  A lumbering, ham fisted outline of what could have been a good movie.  John Favreau is a top flight chef who has a hissy fit at a food critic (which is clearly what he's always wanted to say to movie critics ((and what he probably wants to say to me))(((oh who am I kidding he'd not reading this.)))((((is he?))))(((((probably not)))))((((((wow that's a lot of brackets))))))and loses his job.
Scarlett Johansson plays the hostess who believes in him and longs for him.  Then disappears.  She literally disappears in the 2nd act never to be heard from or talked about again.
Sophia Vegara is his ex wife who is successful, but somehow finds time to help him run his food truck.
John Leguizamo is the ethnic sidekick, who gives up his job to help John Favreau find his passion.
Oh and there's a kid who Favreau reconnects with and who helps his food truck become famous by posting on social media.  Because...reasons.  It must have been a last minute decision to add him because all he gets to do is look disappointed.
I just realized.  Every character in this film has no other function in their lives other than to help the Chef.  There is not one character in this whole film who is ever anything more than a plot device.

6441759,2,B00KQTGWPC,"I hate to sound like a crusty old critic, but for what was ostensibly supposed to be a road movie, it took over one hour to get the food truck rolling, and even then it was nothing more than a Twitter experience.  Jon Favreau may be doing what he loves, but judging by the split frames it wasn't even him doing the cooking.  It seems Jon substituted food for his own frustrations in movie making.  He wanted to go back to his roots and make a fun movie about something he loved, but in the end it comes off as a rather dopey father-son melodrama with John Leguizamo tagging along to provide some laughs.

I don't think Jon did much research here, as it is hard to imagine an LA restaurant forcing a top chef to serve the same tired cuisine day in and day out for ten years.  Riva (Dustin Hoffman) treats Casper (Favreau) like an indentured servant, never allowing him to experiment again after a failed ""sweet bread.""  So, when Casper gets dished by the reigning food critic (a fleeting Oliver Platt) for serving up the same old food, the angry chef takes to Twitter to vent his frustration, amassing an impressive following virtually overnight.  All fine and good for a five-minute intro, but for whatever dumb reason Favreau chose to dwell on this for nearly an hour before finally summoning up the balls to walk out on Riva.

Even when Casper finally decides to take his show on the road there is more vacillation, with a few object lessons passed down to his son, who is really the star of this show.  The boy is instructed on the value of stainless steel pans, as the two clean up the wreck they have been given as a food truck.  If I was Percy I would have walked out at this point, but since this was his surrogate father's movie, he dutifully accepts the lesson and gets back on the food truck.

I must hand it to Favreau in his taste of women.  Only in a movie like this would a down-and-out chef have Sofia Vergara and Scarlett Johannson to choose from.  It turned out to be a pretty easy choice as Favreau used Scarlett for little more than erotically slurping on a bowl of spicy noodles he prepared after bombing out with the food critic.

If you like food movies there are much better movies to choose, such as The Big Night.  This is pretty much Olive Garden variety.",1435968000,9,2281,4.38479809976247

Yes, there are F bombs and explicit language, but no sex and no violence.  And guess what, most kids hear profanity now a days in music and everyplace else.

The themes of following your passion, understanding the impact of social media, divorce and reconciliation are all handled very well in this movie.  Plus the food looks pretty incredible.  It is a fun, beautiful movie with a lot of heart.",1435881600,,570,4.311320754716981

6441806,5,B00KQTGWPC,"There are nearly 3,000 reviews for this film, so I'll keep this personal.  Knowing what being on the road is like, and as portrayed in this film, there is no way that Chef Carl could ever be happy for long in a brick and mortar restaurant.

It's hard to watch the road trip without knowing that, for me, my 4 month trip of this type in 1992 was the star in an otherwise pedestrian life, even with all the risks, and doing it bare bones with nothing to return to.  That was too long ago.

Beautiful film..

The two errors, which, given the incredible detail and training involved in the making of this film, become more glaring each time it is watched:  permitting in New Orleans, and in Austin.  No way would anyone be allowed to open up without one, even for a day.  In Miami, the permit was verified.  You know, it's a really big error not to have one word about permitting in other places.  Sadly, or fortunately, depending on one's point of view, the permitting process is what keeps these open road adventures when they involve food, prohibited.",1433894400,,1050,4.450261780104712

6441817,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Most everyone has explained the story premise so I'll not waste your time.  Here's my honest opinion.  Like a lot of films, the Chef doesn't know it wants to be.  Is it a Father-Son film, a lost-my-way film, a love-lost film, or was it supposed to be a coming-of-age film?  The problem is the film was trying to be all of those things.

I'm big John Favreau fan so I was expecting a little more from both structure and character development.  We meet his ex-wife played by Sofia Verga, she's living large but we never know what she does. At what we thought would be the end of the second act she takes Chef Carl Casper (Favreau) to Miami for a work trip.  We still never know what she does but apparently she's well paid for it.  I'm not sure why that was never explained but apparently Favreau didn't feel it was important.  I mention this is at the end of the second act but in fact it was only mid way through the second act.  We never really know when the third act starts because the film kind of rambles. With that said, just about the time you're ready to give up on it, Favreau brings in some great music and some funny scenes with his friend played by John Leguizamo.  Those two items alone makes the film worth the time.

Chef is worth the watch but I would never refer to this film as family-friendly or a romantic comedy. It does promote drug use and the pervasive use of profanity seems a little uncalled for.  It's fun to see all of Favreau's A-list friends make appearances in the film- he should know he's loved.",1433635200,,1528,4.300699300699301

The concept of a bevy of beautiful women being attracted to an obese short order cook because he knows how to whip up tasty meals is laughable. Sofia Vergara has a minor role in this boring movie although she was billed heavily as having a major role.

6441862,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I like Jon Favreau, but he usually plays the same kind of character - ornery, foul-mouthed, and cantankerous.  Frankly, I like him in that kind of role, and he has elements of that in ""Chef.""  However, by being in the lead, he's able to develop his character into something a lot deeper and shows what a talented and multidimensional entertainer he really is.

Without getting too detailed into the plot, he's a very hardworking and passionate chef, who's trying to use his creativity to make his work more artistically rewarding and to please a local critic he ultimately respects, but he's stuck in a job in which the restaurant owner is not willing to take chances by changing a menu that the public generally likes but that has become old hat.  He's a risk-taker who puts his urge to be creative above his financial security and decides to become his own boss, albeit in a much humbler but more liberating enterprise.  He's a divorced father who regrets that he does not spend enough time with his young son and decides to incorporate him into his business to build his relationship and discovers that his son has very useful talents that greatly benefit him.  He's an ex-husband who swallows his pride and takes his ex-wife's career advice, which not only turns out to be a smart career move but helps him restore his family.

Not only did Favreau do a remarkable job, he got a fantastic cast to support him.  Some are very well-known (Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey, Jr., Sofia Vergara, Oliver Platt, and Scarlet Johansson), and some are lesser known (Emjay Anthony and John Leguizamo), but they're all good.

It was a wonderful cast and story about a top chef who gets stuck in a creative conundrum and stays stuck so long he ends up losing it, literally and figuratively. The result is a search for reinvention and reconnection. The really great part of the story is the story of a dad reconnecting with his son and finding his future in his past. Heartwarming and inspiring in many ways. While I let my 11 year old watch the movie, some may find the language inappropriate.

6441907,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef is a ""slice of life"" story. A fabulously creative chef is forced to make the same food over and over again by the owner of a successful LA restaurant. A popular food blogger writes a scathing review of the meal prepared for him by Chef and an accidentally public war between the chef and the blogger breaks out.

What follows is a journey of the heart. Chef leaves his post and rediscovers his passion. In the process, he also rekindles a relationship with his son and ex-wife.

This film sounds kind of sappy, but it is so well executed that you'll never notice. The script is straightforward. The acting is pitch perfect. The conclusion is satisfying. Overall, a fun and engaging movie.

6441933,3,B00KQTGWPC,"With beautifully shot food images and mouth-watering cast of actors, Chef looks great at first. For all the star/director/writer Jon Favreaus efforts to create a sweet and smart comedy drama, however, Chef fails to deliver because of one simple reason: it doesnt have a story to tell.

Jon Favreau plays Carl Casper, a successful chef at a popular LA restaurant. Panned by a food critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) on the internet, Carl quits the job, buys an old food truck, makes Cuban sandwiches and goes on a trip with his son Percy (Emjay Anthony) and colleagues  even though there is no need to do that.

Maybe Carls culinary journey is meant to represent his looking at himself and his life, and reestablishing the father-son bond. I know, but the films story, which sounds too good to be true, offers no real challenge to our hero. The films another and more intriguing theme, Carl/Favreaus bitter comment on critics in the earlier part of the film, is left undeveloped.

Chef is a light-hearted feel-good movie that could have been better with a decent storyline.",1429833600,,1073,4.8469945355191255

6441944,5,B00KQTGWPC,"This is a pleasant, funny, engaging movie. If you're looking for what I've started calling a ""grown-up"" movie, this certainly fits the bill. No flashy special effects, no car chases, no explosions, and something that more than passingly resembles a real story.  Oh, sure, there are more than a few standard cliches - confusing technology for an ""oldster"", work-obsessed divorced dad, etc. etc. etc. But, it's all done in a way that's enjoyable to watch, and moves right along. Jon Favreau, who in my opinion is criminally underrated as an actor, is excellent in the lead, and the supporting cast is strong.  Even Sofia Vergara, who is often a bit over-the-top for me, is in control and enjoyable in her role. (Slight Spoiler Alert: If anyone can figure out what her actual job is in this movie, let me know!)  Anyway, I give this 5 stars for a couple of reasons. First, we need more movies like this - plot-and-story driven films are a dying breed, and this one is one of the better ones I've seen. Second, there is no 4.5 rating I can give. Is it really a 5?  Well, it's more of a 4.5, but when forced with a choice between 4 and 5, in the case of this movie, I go with the 5. Go ahead, give this film a chance; I don't believe you'll be disappointed.",1429574400,,1252,4.406926406926407

6441993,2,B00KQTGWPC,"A disappointment, unfortunately. No surprises. The idea of getting a food truck was already in consideration before there were any troubles with the restaurant business. How predictable is that? Some scenes were very tedious, such as shopping for appliances or watching a meal be prepared in its entirety. Those dragging scenes should have been edited down. Anyway, you know exactly what is going to happen, but it takes forever to happen. No twists, no big humor, no amazement. Also, few things are explained. The Chef's wife is very rich and does what? Why does the ex-husband have people wear those booties? Sofia is a knock out and acts well. No bad actors in the bunch, just a mildly interesting story told in a laborious manner.",1428278400,,734,4.88

I didn't even make it to the food truck portion, maybe it got funnier. I'm sure there was good messages about loving your job no matter how fancy it is, but I honestly couldn't get into it to find out in the end.

With the intimacy of an Indie film, Jon Favreau has created not only a terrific insiders look into the world of restaurant cooking, he created an intimate family of interesting, real flesh and blood characters that, I would guess, has inhabited his mind for awhile. My son told me about the film, raved about crazy knife skills that Favreau learned for this movie, so I said ok and rented it. I have raved about it ever since. I want to 1. go to any restaurant he is cooking in, and 2. Find that street in LA that the food trucks are parked in.",1428019200,,564,4.280373831775701

It shows the evolution of relationships and how working together on a project can bring people together.  And this project revolves around food, so it's already a step in the right direction for me!

My favorite scene is between father and son when the son wants to serve a less than perfect sandwich:
Father:  Is this boring to you?

Son:  No, I like it.

Father:  Well, I love it.  Everything thats good thats happened to me in my life came because of [cooking].
I might not do everything great in my life.  Im not perfect.  Im not the best husband, and Im sorry if I wasn't the best father.
But Im good at this.  And I want to share this with you.  I want to teach what I learned.
I get to touch peoples lives with what I do.  It keeps me going and I love it.  I think if you give it a shot, you might love it, too.  Now, should we have served that sandwich?

6442118,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Seldom do many people have the guts to throw-in a comfortable job for what they believe in and to also pursue their own creative direction. Chef contains a multi-layered narrative where insensitive criticism destroys a secure world, but drives motivation, and in the process a happier life grows. There were some predictable facets to the plot but the story was truly rich with personal transformation, rebuilding relationships, finding greater satisfaction in life, and a southern east to west road trip across America kept the movie dynamic. An absolutely cracking cast of newer and experienced talent.

6442119,5,B00KQTGWPC,I watched the movie a few days ago who rented it from Netflix. I am so glad she invited me to see it and wonder how such a WONDERFUL movie was in the theaters last year and I never heard of it!!!  I have had it on my mind since I saw it. The last two+ months had been totally frigid and  snowy. Except for necessary trips out of the house...we have been stuck at home. This movie was such a mood lifter. I recommend it to all. My only caution is some bad language...it didn't bother me but parents should be aware.,1425772800,,514,3.9805825242718447

But because everyone in it was likable, there was no ""villain,"" (except Hoffman's somewhat misguided character, and he was far from villainy.)  So there was no dramatic tension, which means the story spun out on a horizontal trajectory, with no climax, no denouement, no peaks and valleys.  Even the ending was no big surprise.

6442134,2,B00KQTGWPC,Can't believe this movie was classified as a comedy.  There was nothing funny about it. It was so dull and boring that it put me to sleep halfway through.  The music was probably the best part of the movie and the actor who played the son.  Very unlikely in real life that the son would turn out to be such a nice kid with such a dysfunctional mom and dad.  In fact one wonders what the mom ever found appealing about the dad.  He came across from the beginning as a complainer and a foul-mouthed loser even if he was a great chef.  Because I fell asleep halfway through the movie I think I should give it at least 2 stars because the chef was in a better place near the end.,1425427200,,675,4.075757575757576

6442193,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Such a delightful movie about the love of food and most importantly family and friends! I had heard such great things about this movie and I was truly not disappointed! I have always enjoyed movies with the theme of food ( Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, Like Water for Chocolate, Soul Food, The 100 Foot Journey) well, because, I LOVE food! And the story itself was just heartwarming, and gorgeously produced and well acted. I have been a fan of Jon Favreau since ""Swingers"" and he brings such a complexity to his role as Carly. You truly understand his passion and art in the food preparation process as well as his frustration in not being allowed to be creative as head chef at the restaurant that he is employed at. I loved the friendship between Carl and John Leguizamos' Martin and they balanced eachother quite nicely. Sofia Vegara, Oliver Platt, Dustin Hoffman and a hilarious Robert Downey Jr. are minor yet key players in Carl's transformation throughout the movie. However,  it is his relationship with son Percy which really establishes the film and you get real life dynamics between a lost father and abandoned tech saavy son with Percy and Carl. GREAT acting all around, with the gorgeous food cinematography and awesome Cuban soundtrack, watching Carl's transformation during the film satisfied me on all levels and I had a smile on my face until the very end. JF did VERY well with  learning the cooking techniques for this role and he was quite convincing as a well renound chef. All in all, a fabulous film and I highly recommend it to anyone.

Jon Favreau has an excellent performance, and really feels what all chefs experience at some point or another. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson makes appearances as delightful characters to support their fellow Marvel comrade.

6442219,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I will admit to being a victim of buyng movies based on the preview. Far too often the preview has all the punchlines, or all the highlights. Given the cast, I assumed the screenplay HAD to have some substance.  I am happy to report that this movie has much more substance to it. It is obvious that it is made for ""foodies"" but the real message is that if you do what you love, and love what you do, nothing can stop you. It's almost a coming of age story, with the ""chef"" realizing that what all his son has EVER wanted to do was for him to be happy and love him.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in quite a while.  It is definitely worth buying.  The musical score deserves praise as well.",1424390400,,702,4.028776978417266

6442271,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Last week I streamed the film ""Chef,"" Jon Favreau's film about an LA chef who has a media blowup that makes him unemployable in LA, who then acquires a food truck in Miami and does a road trip to New Orleans and Austin on his way back to LA. I had wanted to see it in a theater but it had a short shelf life. I enjoyed the film very much. The food scenes are incredible food porn (and food love, it doesn't have to be all porn.) Scarlet Johansen has a role as a waitress, and she looks good but, God, the food looks great! Besides Johansen, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara (using, as a reviewer noted, her inside voice for once,) Oliver Platt, John Leguizamo, all have roles.

A well done small personal film that the reviewers generally found pleasant enough but fainted on praise for not exploring new dramatic ground and having a predictable arc of recovery. Loss due to personal failings greatly assisted by outside factors and then recovery and redemption. How humdrum. Drug or alcohol addiction followed by suicide would have been more compelling?

I heartily recommend the film but I also greatly enjoyed the soundtrack. I immediately ordered the soundtrack CD from Amazon and am listening to it now. Salsa, soul, blues, reggae, country, hip-hop, this is a wonderful collection.

I recommend both the film and the soundtrack.",1424044800,,1349,4.7076271186440675

6442277,3,B00KQTGWPC,"I loved Jon Favreaus exuberance towards cooking, was probably the highlight, I truly believed he was a top-flight Chef.. the rest, not so much...just didn't see him with Sofia Vergara - ex or otherwise. The son ""Percy"" Emjay Anthony was a rather dull addition to the cast which could have made this a much better movie had this been cast better. Little things like Carl ""being broke"" then spending thousands of dollars on restoring the food truck just didn't ring true (on credit?). The feel good ending with him working in the critics restaurant? Why go back to that when he was perfectly happy in the truck? Just didn't make much sense..

It will be in my ""favorites of all time"" list because the script, the acting, the entire production was so well done that it's one of those movies that you just won't forget. It has the effect of not only drawing the audience in to root for the lead, as well as his family and friends, but it had me reflecting on all the blessings in my own life. It does emphasize that you have to find your own happiness before you can truly attend to others' needs. I have many obstacles in my life that would probably have most people drowning in unhappiness, but I found that if I am able to still find purpose in my live and express my creative side, then I have that ""spark"" in my spirit that makes loving others so very easy. I hope this inspires so many to find what fuels their ""spark.""",1423785600,,890,4.120689655172414

6442313,5,B00KQTGWPC,"A complete feel-good tour-de-force, with an all-star cast, (including Scarlett Johannson, Dustin Hoffman John Leguizamo and Robert Downey Jr.), ""Chef"" is one of those movies that you must watch after having a hard day.  A downtrodden former culinary genius meets his public demise ala social media, but finds his passion and makes a spectacular comeback while realizing what is really important in life.

Sprinkled liberally with a great soundtrack and little surprises.  Yes, an homage to Chef Roy Choi, (fantastic chef who is considered the father of the modern food truck movement) via the Kogi food truck in the background.  An unexpected delight, is the cinematography, which is fantastic.  The ending is unsurprisingly predictable, but the ride getting there is so much fun, that you won't mind.

Jon Favreau at his absolute best.....
John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale are delightful, but keep an eye out for the young Emjay Anthony in the future.  If Hollywood doesn't ruin him, this kid is going to be a star!",1423353600,,1018,5.096385542168675

Although I haven't always loved the vehicle (""Friends""), I have always enjoyed his performances. ""Chef"" is a wonderful story with an outstanding cast. As always, John Leguzamo does not disappoint. He & JF have a genuine chemistry which lends credibility to the story and the relationship. I was in the restaurant business for 20 years and lived in the Miami area so maybe I related a bit more but this is a clean, well-acted film. Honestly, just a lot of fun to watch! No swearing, no sex or violence, no trashy, repulsive content. You can watch this one with everybody. You may get a hankering for a Cuban sandwich, or get the urge to Congo by the film's end but unless you're some dark hearted, social outcast, you should really enjoy this film.",1423267200,2,884,4.673076923076923

I have to endure the f-word when out in public sometimes, but I won't buy the movie and endure that kind of language in my home.

Leguizamo and Cannavale do their usual shtick of playing themselves. Scarlett does Scarlett. A doddering, annoying Dustin does Dustin. Sofia does a watered down version of her Gloria from Modern Family. You are always aware that you're watching a movie here. Everyone has their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks. When the ALWAYS ANNOYING and ALWAYS SMUG Robert Downey Jr entered the pic, we were DONE. We kept waiting for something to happen and it doesn't.

6442324,5,B00KQTGWPC,"As books are my favorite form of entertainment, I don't usually review films. But this one shines so brightly that to not share its lights would be like abandoning your own mother.
What is it about these people that is so attractive? I loved Gordon Ramsey's videos, and this is the second excellent film I've seen recently that centered on a struggling chef. The culinary art is truly that - an art - and a mystery to most of the rest of us.
Carl Casper (played by actor/director Jon Favreau) is a famous and successful chef about to introduce a completely new and exciting menu to the patrons of Riva's (Dustin Hoffman) restaurant. It's not an ordinary night: food critic Ramsey Mitchel (Oliver Platt) will be there, and ready to tell all about it. All is ready, until at the last moment Riva exerts his authority and forces Carl to abandon his plans and produce the same old same old. The result is predictable.
All this is not taking place in a vacuum. Carl is juggling visitation rights with his disillusioned son Percy (Emjay Anthony), trying to stay on the good side of his wealthy ex (Sofia Vergara), and working to develop his kitchen staff (scene stealers John Leguizano (Martin), Bobby Cannavale (Tony) and the very alluring Molly, (Scarlet Jonhasson).
And then the review is published.
What comes next is the stuff classics are made of. Watch as Carl cooks for himself - moments of real beauty - and then get ready for a road trip that will fill you with joy.

The biggest flaw that stuck out to me and made the movie almost unwatchable was the casting. The male lead is fat and incredibly unattractive, yet he's romantically paired with Sophia Vergara and Scarlett Johansson.

6442345,4,B00KQTGWPC,"As I've been exposing myself to new types of movies and different filmmakers, I sometimes feel like I'm trying new food. CHEF, directed by and starring Jon Favreau, was a delightful little indie ""dish"" and an immensely satisfying treat. It's about a chef, Carl Casper (Favreau), who works for this French restaurant. One night a critic (Oliver Platt) comes in and later posts a scathing review on Twitter that goes viral. Carl, a little bit new to social media, inadvertently starts a flame war with the critic and challenges him to come back because he'll cook the menu he wanted to cook the first time around. Things don't end up going so well, and Carl leaves his job as chef and takes his ex-wife's (Sofia Vergara) advice about starting a food truck. Narratively, the film is somewhat divided. The first third or so is more of a traditional ""food"" movie with some relationship drama thrown in, but at a critical point the film shifts gears into a road trip movie. Structure aside, I thought that they did a great job balancing the food aspects (which looked amazing) and the character relationships. The key relationship is between Carl and his son, who comes along with him on his food truck journey. It was really great to see how the relationship changed and improved over the course of the film. Something should also be said for the cast. Although most of them have relatively small roles, Favreau was able to call in some favors and get Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara to appear here. Even though most of these people only appear in the first half when Carl works at the restaurant (and are therefore dropped once the narrative switches gear), it was still nice to see them. I thought they all gave excellent performances, even for such small roles. The only iffy member of the cast was the boy who plays Carl's son who, at times, seemed like a blank slate. Maybe that was intentional? I don't know, but he also is a child actor so I won't make too big a deal out of it. The only other aspect of the movie I find fault with is the way in which the film ends, which I won't spoil here. All I'll say about it is that it was a little TOO nice and clean. That being said, I thought that CHEF really worked on an emotional level. Overall, it might not be the best film I've ever seen, but it had a feelgood atmosphere, great dialogue and some great cooking. Bon appetit!",1422576000,,2462,4.5598194130925505

6442347,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I was previously introduced to Chef by an email from an app developer (creator of 1 Second Everyday). They shared that the app played a role in the plot of the movie and I was excited when I finally got to watch Chef.

Chef follows the story of a Master Chef in the kitchen of a well-known Hollywood restaurant. We open with the Chef and his staff preparing a menu for an incoming (well respected) food critic and blogger. The owner, however, view this opportunity to serve the menu that the restaurant is known for rather than something new to impress the critic, as Chef Carl hopes to. A power struggle ensues, but Chef concedes to his owner's demands.

Supported by his maitre d (Scarlett Johanson) and his Sous Chef (John Leguizamo), the night proceeds. Needless to say, the critic is not impressed and Chef Carl is pommeled by the review. He learns from his young son, how to use Twitter after the next morning all of his staff invoke the term ""[forget] Twitter"". Learning that Twitter was being blasted with retweets of the reviews, Chef Carl responds to the critic (thinking it was a private message) thus creating a feud becoming a viral sensation over Twitter.

Having been shamed from his restaurant, Chef Carl buys a food truck and begins serving Cuban sandwiches in Florida. Deciding to drive the truck back to California and stopping along the way, Carl's son documents their journey over Twitter, Vine, and One Second Everyday. Unbeknownst to Carl, initially, each stop is met with crowds of people waiting to meet and visit @ChefCarlCasper.

6442367,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Boy, and I thought the reviews for Begin Again were overly generous.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I turned on Jon Favreau after he stole Stephen Writght's breakfast-any-time gag for one of his films.

As to this pic: there are some very nice bits here, some nice scenes where the acting and writing are quite nice. The scene with Robert Downey Jr.is good, there are others. But Favreau is a very lazy writer. If something doesn't work ... he sticks with it.

Take the scene -- there is no plot giveaway in a Jon Favreau film -- where the John Leguizamo character shows up, ready to join the food truck. This shortly after he told chef over the phone he had been named sous chef at the chef's former restaurant, which was a big opportunity, said chef, and from all appearances John Leguizamo agreed. Then he shows up ready to work! Not even a few seconds back in the kitchen w Leguizamo, hanging up the phone slowly, pondering where his true heart lies...

Then the nonsense wrap-up. (There is no plot giveaway.....) Utterly unnecessary for the Oliver Platt character to back chef in new enterprise. For starters, Platt character -- online food critic -- says he sold his blog for a lot of money; but wouldn't he BE the blog? So what did the buyer buy? Then chef's new restaurant opens -- a kind of upscale Chili Hut, or whatever they're called -- the complete opposite look -- phony -- from the authentic food he spends the film searching for and making.

This is the first thing I've seen Sophia Vergara in, she adds nothing but intermittent cleavage, which Claudia Cardinale did a whole lot better. (Constant cleavage.) And Dustin Hoffman .... he's almost become the white Morgan Freeman, you simply cannot look and him and not think THIS IS AN ACTOR.

6442391,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Im not going to lie, I didn't exactly run to see Chef when it first came to theaters in May. For whatever reason it only registered in my mind as Jon Favreau is starring in a movie? What is this 1996? and left it at that. Any rumblings I heard about it were minor and they mostly left me without much interest in shelving out $15 at the local cineplex. Boy did I miss the boat.

Part coming-of-age story, and part road trip movie (with a twist of rom-con over a bed of mid-life crisis), Chef stars Favreau (doing triple duty as writer/director) as a stagnating Los Angeles chef thats seen better days and more creative dishes. A clash with his boss, Dustin Hoffman, over the staleness of the menu and an unfortunately public meltdown with a prominent food critic, Oliver Platt, force Favreau to get back to his roots on a journey that takes him (and us) to Miami, New Orleans, and Austin with plenty of stops to stare at some of the most delicious food in the country.

To call this food porn would be an understatement, but to classify this movie as any one thing this would be a mistake. Yes, its food porn and yes, its predictable at times, and yes, it can even be a little manipulative, but it works, and who can complain about that? I knew from frame one that this story would have a happy ending (spoiler alert: it does) but that didn't matter because the characters were so likable I couldn't get enough of them. In addition to Hoffman and Platt, Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo, and Robert Downey Jr. take turns brightening the screen with their star power and gravitas, but the real winner is Favreau who has certainly come along way since Swingers. After directing a glut of big budget action films from Iron Man (and its sequel) to the much maligned Cowboys & Aliens its nice to see Favreau, much like the title character of this film, get back to his roots. Keep up the good work.",1421366400,,1910,4.454285714285715

It gets better once he is on the road with his son, but still drags.",1420675200,5,387,4.394366197183099
6442435,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Iron Chef, Chopped Chef, Sou Chef, Zen Master Chef, Chef de Cuisine, hell, salad chef and even dishwashers have grabbed a new found respect in the world of the professions ever since the food craze, fine food mainly, of the last decade or so had swept America (elsewhere too but we will stick to America on this one). Hell, there is even a new awkward and rather obtuse word added to the vernacular over the trend, foodie (ugh! okay). So it was kind of inevitable that a movie audience tired of watching lawyers, doctors, politicians and super-heroes, real or imagined, would be treated a film based on this new trend, the film under simply titled Chef.

Ordinarily the professional chef is well hidden in the back of the house along with his or her staff and the other auxiliary components that make up a restaurant, especially a fine dining restaurant. In this film we find those previously vague figures who work long and odd hours, devote themselves to serving the best meals possible, and trying to keep their weight down and their drinking habits in check have lives and dreams outside of the sweaty hectic kitchen and that is what drives this film.

Our chef du jour is one Carl Caspar (played by the person who wrote and directed the film, Jon Favreau) who is like lots of chefs concerned with providing good food and also being the master of his or her domain, the kitchen. Naturally like any organization there is a certain power structure when the chef works for somebody else while waiting on that dream of owning his or her own restaurant. So that provides one tension (especially when the owner is played by over the top Dustan Hoffman one of many known stars  in a film with many cameo performances by big stars who must sense this food thing will illuminate their careers). But the big dust-up is between Chef Carl and the local blogger and food critic out in Los Angeles who has panned Chef Carls latest efforts. Panned him mercilessly when all Chef Carl wanted to do was showcase his own work and that controversy between boss, critic and chef lead to Chef Carl leaving his cushy job.

Of course the trials and tribulations of any professional are thin gruel for a film of a couple of hours so there is another story-line to draw you in, or rather two parts of a story-line. One is all about owning your own shop and Chef Carl by hook or by crook goes about that task with a vengeance when after he left that cushy fine dining job his options got significantly reduced and he wound up making a go of the latest craze in fast food dining-the food truck. Not just any haphazard food but specializing in cubanos and other culinary delights reflecting his Miami birth and his ex-wifes Cuban-American heritage (played by Soffa Vergara) who helped set him up with the truck (via an ex-husband of hers). Chef Carl would turn out so successful in that enterprise that even the bastard food blogger who had previously panned him wanted to back him into his very own restaurant.

The other part of the story-line is his renewed relationship with his young son (played by Emjay Anthony) who has chaffed under the strain of his parents divorce and his overworked fathers lack of attention to him. That food truck and a cross-country trip from Miami (Little Havana, naturally) to the West Coast is something of a coming of age for both of them. And drives his parents back together. Check this one out.",1420675200,,3407,4.606260296540363

John Favreau has been doing so much work behind the camera that I forgot how funny he could be. John Leguizamo was funny without being over the top. This movie makes me wish he'd be in more movies, TV shows, etc. Sophia Vergara was great in her supporting role. She wasn't in the movie as much as I thought she'd be, but she was good nonetheless. Her character was soft spoken and a lot more nuanced than the one she plays in Modern Family. I can't speak for anyone else, but that was a plus for me.

It's the story that's disappointing.  Things go too easily, work out too well.  It sometimes feels like the movie was written while it was being filmed; seemingly interesting characters just disappear as a simpler, happier ending becomes evident.

If you want a simple, non-engaging movie to have on in the background before you go out to eat, consider this one.",1420329600,2,621,4.80188679245283

6442513,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Pretty good feel good flick about a master chef in midlife crisis who gets an epiphany commandeering a food truck that dispenses Cuban food.  Carl Kasper (Jon Favreau) is a perfectionist cook whose energies are directed wholly on food preparation at the expense of his marriage to a saucy Latina( Sofia Vergera.  Who else?) and his ten year old son, Percy(Emjay Anthony).  Despite his fastidiousness Carl hasn't cooked anything original, just the hits, at the behest of his boss (Dustin Hoffman).  Carl quits after being trashed in print and on social media by a sarcastic food critic (Oliver Platt) and begins a trek on the rehabbed food truck from Miami to Los Angeles with Percy and his assistant (John Leguizamo) in tow.  On this trip Karl reconnects with his life's passion and the long neglected Percy.  There's no real flaws in this film maybe slight overlength.  The cast is uniformly excellent and I love the Latin flavor of the enterprise.  The story offers no real surprises but the movie goes down real smooth like a cold beer on a Summer's day.",1420329600,,1057,4.801104972375691

6442560,2,B00KQTGWPC,"**Spoilers ahead**
You'll learn more about how to tweet in this film than about how to cook. Still, it's mostly pretty entertaining to watch this head chef leave his position in a nice restaurant for being forced to cook what the owner wants him to the night a popular food critic visits, leading to an embarrassing confrontation after the ensuing bad review of the food the owner forced the chef to cook. Our chef ends up getting a food truck with his son and a loyal sous-chef and they journey from Miami back to California having some minor adventures and making some Cubanos and other good food for people along the way home. The biggest problem I had with the film was the two leads, Favreau and Leguizamo, inexplicably singing ""Sexual Healing"" in front of the child actor during a later scene in the food truck. Who thought that was a good idea?! There was really no reason for that, but with all the abuse you hear about in Hollywood, it isn't surprising. That really bummed me out that I watched what was an otherwise pretty good film for what it was. If they hadn't put that scene in, I'd give it maybe 4 stars for liking it pretty well, but even then the characters are kind of deplorable people despite their passion for food so it would still not be something I thought was all that great.",1420070400,9,1301,4.470588235294118

A very influential gem as it does show the art of preparing gourmet cuisine, Jon Favreau plays one of the most believable and strong characters I have seen in recent memory and I thought the interactions with Dustin Hoffman and Scarlett Johanson were amazing. There is some comedy in here but most of it is kind of like a drama. In the end it's a great movie for adults as it mostly pertains to work and family. If you love food and some down to earth comedy with strong characters, have at it! The only knock I have on this, is the social media tweet blobs that will come up, I know that a small fraction of this movie is about social media, well an integral part in some aspect. But I couldn't read what they were presenting on screen sometimes, And if you rented it with low resolution like I did to avoid pauses, I probably missed out on some comedy. Not to mention I just found the technique of presenting these blobs in a ""out of character"" kind of way. Some probably will find the ending abrupt, but then again, how would you end it? It's wonderful and I wouldn't mind owning it so I have to give it some love.",1419984000,,1283,4.283950617283951

6442641,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Great movie. It was nice to see Jon Favreau step outside of the blockbuster to create a movie on a smaller budget that is as captivating as Iron Man. If you like food, then you will enjoy watching the chefs in this movie create food that will definitely instill a desire to seek out a cuban sandwich and the other delicious food created in this movie. It was also nice to see Sofia Vergara in a role outside of her Modern Family character.

I would recommend and I will definitely re-watch.",1419811200,,490,4.384615384615385

6442673,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Perhaps one of my favorite films of the year.

The number of celebs making appearances in this film was a bit frustrating, Jon Favreau must have called upon all his friends to come play a part - but that didn't matter. The movie was still great. I had been searching for an uplifting film, and this was it. A chef shot down by a horrible review, a sad relationship with his son - and the pathway to growth in both areas with his food truck. Much needed, much appreciated. Loved it.",1419724800,,481,4.285714285714286

Longer Review: The movie is a great story and message all the way 'round. The acting, writing and direction is superb. The filming on location in Miami, LA, Austin and NOLA is all exceptional with authentic local flavor.

While there is some cursing that may not be appropriate for some small children, it is otherwise a great flick for everyone. It tells several stories all in one including (1) pursuing one's dreams combined with hard work pays off and (2) family is extremely important. In an age when Hollywood wants to turn every hero into a villain, Jon Favreau tells a story of hard work and success without the need for tearing anyone down.",1419638400,3,753,4.489051094890511

By the end of the movie I couldn't believe how engaging it turned out to be. We loved it, best food movie we have ever seen. I am still craving the Cuban sandwhiches. Excellent acting. Tied it all together at the end. Light hearted feel good movie. I believe you can get the recipes for free online now. This is his breakthrough movie. Supporting cast was huge, surprised at big names he was able to cast. This is a must see movie. I still can't believe how good it was. Especially starting out hating it when there was supposed to be a big named movie on the flight.

6442706,2,B00KQTGWPC,"The beginning was exciting and held your interest.....but probably right after they take the trip to Miami, the movie goes downhill, gets a little lost and unbelievable. A chef that worked in Miami, was married to a Cuban American, and has worked in his LA kitchen for years, but somehow cannot speak Spanish? They drive a food truck across the US? And ""Sexual Healing"" is somehow an appropriate song to sing with a 10 year-old......how did this even make the cut? I did like the relationships that we're being built in the beginning with Scarlett Johansson, Percy the son, and Sofia Vergara....but all of this somehow got lost. The last 45 minutes, I kept checking to see how close to the end we were and I probably could have turned it off and gone to bed, but my husband forced us to finish the movie.",1419552000,6,804,4.551724137931035

It's not just a movie about food, it's about finding your passion, stepping back and simplifying, reconnecting with loved ones, adventure, and friendship.

Even if the backdrop is about cooking and food, non-foodies can find many other things to connect with.",1419379200,,392,5.109375

6442766,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" is one of my favorite movies of 2014. After watching it I had to buy several copies to give as gifts for my family to enjoy. Chef, Jon Favreau,  follows a struggling culinary chef as he tirelessly works to find balance between appealing to food critics and earning a living as an employer at a restaurant. As a hard working parents, chef finds little time to spend time with his son that he shares custody with his ex-wife played by Sofa Vergara. After unforeseen events chef has to take to the road to continue to earn a living and we get to see a special bond grow between father and son and we are exposed to music, food and culture of the great American south. The movie has a wonderful cast and for me was a right mix of comedy and drama that makes this movie as enjoyable to watch as I can imagine the food in the movie would be enjoyable to eat.",1419033600,,873,4.227544910179641

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 'CHEF' is far from the first film where a notable Hollywood figure,in this case, Writer, Producer and Actor Jon Favreau, has gathered up some of his closest pals and associates to make a passion project, but it's certainly the most successful example of it in recent memory, as this movie is a delight to watch virtually from beginning to end. It's the kind of film you wish Hollywood would make a lot more of a risky idea, and was there a big demand for a film about a chef? Yes of course and why not, as it turned into perhaps one of THE best film on Jon Favreau's rsum, and yes, I'm including the first `Iron Man' in my assessment.

Jon Favreau stars as Carl Casper, a chef who works in a trendy Los Angeles restaurant, but who feels pigeonholed by the restaurant owner of the said establishment Riva [Dustin Hoffman], who insists Carl Casper doesn't branch out with the menu, but instead sticks with the same-old menu, that has been making the restaurant money for years. When an online food critic Ramsey Michel [Oliver Platt] decides to come in and review the place for his blog, Carl Casper wants to try a whole new menu, but the owner Riva [Dustin Hoffman] insists he stick with the current one. The result is a scathing review by the critic, which turns into a Twitter war with Carl Casper and results in him being fired from the restaurant.

Carl Casper's home life isn't a whole lot better than his working one. He's a divorced dad to his son, Percy [Emjay Anthony], but still very close to his ex-wife, Inez [Sofia Vergara]. Inez has been telling Carl Casper for years that he should give up on the restaurant business and start his own food truck, and Carl Casper's firing provides the perfect opportunity to try the idea out. The second half of 'CHEF' has our primary characters traveling from Los Angeles to Miami, where Carl Casper establishes a food truck business, then decides to drive it back across the country and making a name for himself and his menu along the way.

There's nothing particularly complicated or perhaps even fresh, other than the cooking angle, about the screenplay here, but it's obvious that the actors are having a lot of fun playing their parts, and that enjoyment is translated to the audience. Jon Favreau has employed a small tribe of Hollywood notables for his film, including and in addition to those already mentioned, Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, in a hilarious dry-witted cameo and Jon Favreau's old pal Robert Downey Jr., who gives a very brilliant [but sadly] short performance. It's also worth noting that while 'CHEF' is certainly a comedy; it's not a comedy in either a one-liner or slapstick sort of way. Rather, it finds humour in everyday life and circumstances, which I think is why the movie appealed to me so much. Despite all the star power, the movie and its characters feel 'real.'

Although I usually don't dissect a single scene in a film and especially my Blu-ray Reviews, because there is one in 'CHEF' that I think everyone will want to check out. It comes about half-way into the film, and it's the point where Carl Casper and his critic nemesis Ramsey Michel come face to face, with Carl Casper basically  unloading a diatribe on the critic about how he does all the hard work, while all the critic does is write about how horrible his efforts and results are. I couldn't help but think, and I'm guessing I'm right, that this was Jon Favreau's sly, or perhaps not so sly way of taking a moment in his film, to rail on all such critics per say, who have panned his films over the years. It's a really terrific over the top fun scene, as Jon Favreau also did a totally brilliant job with his awesome Sci-Fi film Cowboys & Aliens.'

'CHEF' is a surprisingly entertaining fun film, and one that is actually more family-oriented than its Adult Rating would initially lead a viewer to think. At its most basic, it's a road movie that shows how Chef Carl Casper [Jon Favreau] starts up a food truck operation, making Cuban sandwiches, to find the creative spark that's been absent from his well-paid work at a Brentwood restaurant. By the time he's done, his whole family has gotten involved, and he's gone from Miami back to Los Angeles with his truck, sampling as much local cuisine as possible along the way. There's more to the story than that, but that's really all you need to know to start watching it. That and the fact that Jon Favreau and his team really enjoy well-prepared food. As someone who has had serious reservations about Jon Favreau being a director, I was pleasantly surprised to have a really terrific good time viewing the Blu-ray. It is my hope that viewers who haven't tried this Blu-ray out will do so now, as you will miss out on something truly special and very magical.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'CHEF' was shot digitally using primarily ARRI ALEXA Cameras equipment and provides a pleasant, if short of  stunning, transfer to this Blu-ray. There is a lot of warmth and colour to the film, but I'm happy to report that it never becomes oversaturated or overly bright, despite the rather lush Miami location, that takes up part of the second-half of the film. Skin tones are nicely natural-looking here, and consistent throughout, again, even when the film changes locations. Black levels aren't quite inky deep, but they're strong and shadow delineation is good and there aren't many dark scenes in 'Chef', but when there are, crush is never an issue. While the film doesn't quite 'pop' the way the best video transfers do, but there is a decent amount of detail to be seen in most shots, and videophiles should be quite happy with what they get here.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  LIONSGATE has delivered a stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is the only one available here, other than the commentary track, and it's decent enough, although it really only comes to life during the films primarily Spanish/Cuban themed soundtrack. 'CHEF, as one can imagine, is heavy on dialogue and light on action, which means this is primarily a talking film. Dialogue is pretty much exclusively limited to the front centre speaker, meaning when the various musical numbers occasionally kick in, you may be reaching for your remote to turn things down, but do not, as it enhances the film and gives you a feel good feel about the film. In other words, there could be a better balance here between the spoken word and the musical background...but it's not the worst I've ever heard on a Blu-ray, although it is noticeable, and this is definitely a ""Universal"" thing, as I have other Blu-rays from them with a similar soundtracks that plays this way. Aside from that slight caveat, this is a decently rendered brilliant track, with some nice activity and no noticeable technical issues or glitches.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Feature Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director/Actor Jon Favreau and Co-Producer/Chef Consultant Roy Choi: This is a really entertaining scene-specific audio commentary with Writer, Director and Actor Jon Favreau and Co-Producer and real-life chef Roy Choi. Both take time to discuss the cooking seen on camera, and which at times it is Roy Chois hands at work and which at times it is Jon Favreau. Jon Favreau is quite honest throughout about what it took to get this film made, and Roy Choi is straightforward about how much of the fil is accurate or not about the work it takes to keep a food truck enterprise going. This is a fun commentary to listen to, just to enjoy the two personalities bounce off of each other. Given the participants, the commentary contains a lot of information about both the making of the road film as well as the food in it, so if you're looking to find out more about either, again this is a very enjoyable must view/hear listen.

Deleted Scenes [2014] [1080p] [10:30] Here you have a collection of seven deleted scenes, which can be viewed back-to-back or separately. All the scenes are completed, as opposed to rough cuts, but viewers will notice the colour timing is just a bit off when compared to the actual film. The deleted scenes consist of Farmer's Market [1:00]; Gauloises [0:30]; Amy Sedaris Outtakes [3:00]; Versailles Lullaby [2:00]; Cuban Coffee with Music [1:00]; First Fridays Setup [2:00] and Second Line [1:00].

BONUS: If you want to really enjoy this film even more, then you should and must go out and purchase CHEF [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD Album] [2014] as it will bring the film soundtrack to even more prominence, with totally awesome pleasure, as Jon Favreau personal had a hand in choosing the track for the film and cooks up a tasty food movie soundtrack in generous proportions and to make your mouth water even more, here is my Compact Disc Review, now read on . . .

Andrew's Compact Disc Review: Jon Favreau is back in the chair with his awesome road film `Chef' and with his latest CD Album concoction. It is a return to his indie roots peppered with appearances from Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and the irresistible Sofia Vergara. The Soundtrack Compact Disc Album, featuring a song selection by KCRW's own Mathieu Schreyer, perfectly mirrors the road trip. For each town, a sample of food and music: salsa-infused Miami to the sounds of Pete Rodriguez and the reggae beats of Grant Phabao, The Lone Ranger and Carlton Livingston, the unmistakable brass band groove in New Orleans with the Rebirth Brass Band and the Hot 8 Brass Band, the gritty guitar sounds from Austin courtesy of Gary Clark Jr. and, in Los Angeles, a West Coast classic hip-hop tune by Ronnie Hudson & The Street People, which is a great compliment to the fantastic character driven film, that is a 10 out 10 star rating. The physical Compact Disc is held in a high-quality DigiPak designed Cover Album which the artwork was designed by Robert Downey Jr. It also includes liner notes by the director and original recipes from Chef Roy Choi of Kogi Food Truck fame. ""The eclectic mix of musical selections chosen by music supervisor Mathieu Schreyer is brilliantly brought together and the compilation Compact Disc combines a soundtrack full of Latin beats and New Orleans grooves and goes with a film that has a heart the size of Texas and the World. As an added bonus, you get printed inside the DigiPak CD cover is 3 Recipes by Roy Choi and they are: Cubano; Tostones with Chile Vengar and Salsa Verde and they sound fantastic and I think they were used in the film. If you want to see the Track Listing, then please search out my actual Compact Disc `Chef' Review via the Amazon web page. Like the brilliant awesome film, CHEF' has you saying, ""Food, glorious food!"" This is what you will say about this totally brilliant Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD Album, because it goes so well as a good compliment with CHEF' the film Jon Favreau's good-natured culinary comedy directed film, which will works as an appetite stimulant. And where there's delicious food -- there is plenty of well-prepared awesome 17 subline unabashed tracks that you will totally devour. But the only downer to this excellent CD Soundtrack Album is track 13. Gary Clark Jr.: When My Train Pulls In (Live in Austin), sadly this is the only one I really hated, as it is heavy rock and just doesn't do anything to me, as I cannot remember where it appeared in the film. But to sum up about this fantastic compilation CD Album, it is best to leave the last word to Jon Favreau in his printed [sic] Note From The Director on this inside of the DigiPak, because Jon Favreau says, ""We were even able to combine some inspired soulful original recordings captured live on the set. Perico kicked off the filming with this timeless Cuban salsa. We also sought to break down the soundtrack to musical ingredients and mother sauces. Whether it was the original songs sampled by hip-hop ""Cavern"" and ""West Coast Poplock"" or genre-bending covers ""C.R.E.A.M.,"" ""Bustin' Loose"" and ""Sexual Healing."" I attempted to do with music what chefs do with food. I wanted to create a layered menu that worked as a whole, while each course having its own playful personality. None of this should matter however. When I first sat down with Mathieu Schreyer, we tasked ourselves with assembling a soundtrack that could serve in place of score, but would listen like a playlist. You should be able to hit play and one song should roll into the next like an old vinyl album. If you find yourself grooving to the awesome 17 tracks, then we've done our job, says Jon Favreau. Highly Recommended!

Finally, `Iron Man' director Jon Favreau heads back to his roots and makes a brilliant low-budget film drama about a man rediscovering his passion and the things that matter most to him. 'CHEF' proved to be a delightful surprise from beginning to end. And there is a real joy to each and every performance of all the actors, apart from the son in the film, who at the beginning got on my nerves, but by the end of the film I warmed to him and gave a good performance, which makes for a film that's equally entertaining. You don't have to be a foodie expert to get satisfaction from this full course serving of cinema exuberance, especially from Jon Favreau. On top of all that, you have an excellent ensemble cast bringing this ultimate ""feel good film,"" that is an all character driven script, bringing you an excellent performance all round and will give you a warm glow by the time the end credits disappear from the screen. Very Highly Recommended!

6442827,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Over the years I've seen a lot of Jon Favreau movies, and I've learned that he can play a good jerk and he makes one helluva blockbuster. With this movie, he plays a bit of a jerk, but it's refreshing to see Favreau make a movie that's not just another hugely expensive blockbuster. While this movie first intrigued me because I'm a bit of a foodie, I ended up really enjoying the story. On the surface, this movie is about Favreau starting over when he is fired from his job in a fancy restaurant, by starting up a food truck. At its heart, however, this movie is about a father (Favreau) reconnecting with his 10-year-old son (Emjay Anthony). He starts off as a bit of a jerk, but he softens and becomes more likable over the course of the movie.

Throughout Chef, we see a lot of familiar faces, including Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson (who Favreau directed and costarred alongside in Iron Man 2), John Leguizamo, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris, and Bobby Cannavale. Despite all of these great actors, Favreau and Anthony are the main stars of the movie, and some of these big names are hardly seen throughout the movie.

I found the movie to be enjoyable, but the plot was pretty predictable. The scenes with food were great, and I wouldn't recommend watching this movie on an empty stomach. The food and colors were all so visually appealing and appetizing, and everything, both in the fancy schmancy restaurant AND in the food truck, looked beyond delicious.  To me it seemed like the food took the forefront in this film, and the plot was secondary. However, I still enjoyed the movie, and can see why this was a pet project of Favreau. Worth a watch, and make a reservation at a top notch restaurant for before or after you watch the movie.",1418428800,,1785,4.589341692789969

6442844,3,B00KQTGWPC,"This movie left me vaguely irritated, my time had been somewhat wasted.

The boy was good all the way through. We don't learn much about the other characters. The top stars (Hoffman and Johannson) come on in bit parts at the front, then never come back (which is fine with me). Vergara,  his ex-wife, has no depth or chemistry with her ex-husband, just is a beautiful, perfect, encouraging ideal of an ex-wife, standing in long gowns a lot for some reason, in L.A. Who wouldn't want an ex-wife like that? But what is her life like?

But, mainly, (SPOILER ALERT) how can this tunnel--visioned, anxious, obsessed, man go from that to (bip!) being a fulfilled and connective father and husband -- we see no transition.

And how is it that his former sous-chef turns up at exactly the right time and just makes the new team work? Why would he leave his very good sous-chef job to which he's just been promoted? No reason in his life and in his relationship with the Chef is given.

Pluses: A lot of the time I felt grateful when there was dialogue which not only seemed real and genuine -- mainly between father and son -- but was better than in many American movies, in which family dialogue is sometimes withholding and frustrating to watch. The best of this real-people  style is in Sally Wainright's award-winning 'Last Tango in Halifax', 1 and 2, a British series. Favreau approaches that and that is what makes this movie substantitive and OK.",1418256000,,1445,4.625

As a 25 year food service veteran from high end to street food vending and everything in between from coast to coast, I can tell you that ""Chef"" is likely one of the first films to accurately portray every aspect of the business.  I was a little turned off by the fact that 'Chef' seems like Social Media propaganda with all of the heavy Facebook and Twitter references and motion graphic integration.  I also liked some of that as I've never seen texting represented well in a film.  Anyway, rent the film, hunker down, and get ready for a visual culinary feast, a side-by-side ride with a pro Chef and his team, right there in the trenches.

They do, but EVERYTHING in this movie ended ""perfectly.""

The one single tiny fault I found was when he went home and cooked amazing meals that no one are. I've worked in the food industry and didn't know anyone, even the most creative I knew, who didn't need a few days away from food to really get into the experimentation mood - and then would perfect a few items at most not an entire spread. However, it didn't take away from the experience and I would happily watch this again.",1417910400,,617,4.318965517241379

Jon Favreau is divine as a Chef who somehow looses his way, but finds it again. It's an edgy, sweet, touching, funny, wonderful story here, with lots of punch. The cast is perfect, the standout being Emjay Anthony (""It's Complicated"") as ""Percy"" the chef's son. Also noteworthy is John Leguizamo and, Miss Sassy herself, Sofia Vergara.

6442963,1,B00KQTGWPC,"John Favreau writes, direct and stars in a movie which depicts a ""chef"" who is professionally and emotionally troubled by having to having to cook in a way that is old, tired, formulaic and unoriginal and in an effort to make money while meeting the culinary desires of the most common denominator. The irony is the actual movie itself - the plot, premise, casting and dialogue - is old, tired, formulaic and unoriginal.

The only downfall was the end of the movie.  I am someone who loves a happy ending, but the ending of this film was too ""neat and tidy.""
**Spoiler Alert**
99% of the people who are divorced do not get back together again.  The fact that this chef got back together with his ex-wife was a little too ""Hallmark Channel"" for me.  However, the food scenes were beautiful and the depiction of social media was spot on.",1417392000,,561,4.470588235294118

6443002,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef feels like a movie grown out of a love of food and that love shows throughout the film, with close-ups of cooking that would make the Food Network jealous. But food is not the heart of the film. That comes from a father trying to reconnect with his young son, at the same time he's reconnecting with himself. There is plenty of star wattage in supporting roles - Robert Downey Jr (in a hilarious bit as a flaky ex-husband of the ex-wife), Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, etc. - but Jon Favreau is center stage in a charming movie that will satisfy the heart, but make you very hungry for a post-movie meal.",1417392000,,644,4.512820512820513

6443013,5,B00KQTGWPC,"We all have our daemons to face.  For some of us, its complacency.  When you are an individual of passion & talent, not challenging yourself often yields more despair & static in your life than facing confrontation and overcoming adversity; whether it be internal or external, professional or personal.

Reminding ourselves of who we are by rediscovering that which we are best at, once we invest all that is us, into our yields, provides us with the internal strength to weather the external's unknown.  Sometimes the best way to start finding yourself is by realizing that you've become lost in the first place... and there is certainly no better time to do so.

Jon Favreau ignites humanity and empathy as his character, a highly recognized & accomplished Chef dubbed ""El Jefe"" tries desperately to latch onto his internal fire & passion for the culinary investments he shares with the stomachs and pallets of others.  Thwarted at every attempt, Jefe's passion is given a chance to shine after he bobs & weaves his way through his bureaucratic  chain of contacts after he hits a new level of emptiness & despair only to stumble upon a diamond-in-the-rough food truck.

Through diligence, tenacity, understanding, patience, & good old-fashioned hard-work, our Chef tries his hardest to navigate his way through this tumbling turmoil we all call Life, in hopes of achieving what we all desperately desire: internal & external acceptance.  He, much like us, creates his own obstacles and the only question is whether or not he has the awareness to identify & resolve the underlying roots of his chaos.",1417305600,,1601,4.988721804511278

6443017,4,B00KQTGWPC,"We loved it. Cooking and behind-the-scenes life at your favorite upscale restaurant are realistic, funny. The story behind it takes second place and is in the final analysis not very important ... however, father-son-mother-lover story of complete lack of work-life balance rings true to this profession and most others when you reach near the top. Incorporation of social media by way of twitter graphics I found a bit distracting. Jon Favreau is excellent. Scarlett Johannson's minor role as a sex-symbol, muse/family guidance counselor is unconvincing but I love her anyway ... Sofa Vergara performance was great: touching and sympathetic wife who never quite falls out of love with Favreau and is another guide to get back to roots ... which is where the Cuban food truck comes in.

Relationships and dialog are so real - surprising since he appears with major actors from other movies he has done. There are no detectable mannerism carry-overs or character breaks (actors just having fun moments). The supporting cast are heavy hitters who do not steal the show. His character's relationship with the son is evocatively awkward, tender and evolving. The actor who plays his son is so believable and amazingly understated for such a young person. They hit just the right combination of fast pace and unpredictability to pull the viewer in and keep you engaged. And the food makes you want to go out and find a great restaurant.

[Contrast it with Jersey Boys, for example, where there's only ONE character with even a shred of moral character, and that one is the character played by Christopher Walken. But I digress.] Favreau is what we need to revitalize the culture of sensitive American Film - he's our modern equivalent of Frank Capra. See this movie. It's not perfect [Transitions go by too fast, and some nuances of story development weren't fully smoothed into place] but this film is where we all ought to be going.

If this movie was geared towards men who like food and go on road trips, then it fits that genre.  A wider audience could have enjoyed this movie more if it had been dialed down.  I would have enjoyed thirty minutes longer with this engaging story--some background into the food truck scene in L.A. leading up to the ending.  It's hard to see a good movie/story end.  The food segments were fabulous, as some have suggested, more of them would have been great.  I enjoyed the clever way social media was used in this movie too.
It may not be fair for me to compare this with  'The One Hundred Foot Journey', another great foodie movie with a great story line but a good movie doesn't need excessive strong language to get us hooked to a good story.",1417132800,,836,4.3896103896103895

This is not an academy award runaway nor a summer blockbuster, but a light hearted family comedy that stands firmly on its own two feet. I t just so happens that this film is based on a chef. While alot of films have used a culinary background none have show such authenticity like the movie chef. This movie is excellent whether you know anything about the food industry or not. But, if you happen to know anything, you'd be surprised at how close this film comes to reality in the kitchen. From the dialouge to the dishes being sreved. That being said this is a film for everyone. The story is light hearted and fun. With most films you are waiting for the plot twist or the last disaster just before the characters find ways to mend their troubles moments before films end.

Divorced from his wife and with little real quality time for his 10-year-old son, Carl's world tumbles even further when a bad review from a major blogger critic leads to a meltdown that gets him fired, world famous on YouTube for being a nutcase, and - in desperation - purchasing a food truck that, in the end, could be both his personal and professional saving grace, after all.  Written and directed by Favreau as well, the film hits all the right marks and some really sweet moments, but overall for me just felt kind of devoid of real emotion that made me feel connected with the characters.

6443107,3,B00KQTGWPC,"I'd give this movie 3.5 stars, but since I can't give 1/2 ratings, I'll have to leave it at 3 stars (but it was a tough call.)  The performances are all pretty solid. There are a LOT of celebrities in this one, but many of them are drive-by or drop-in performances in what appear to be personal favors to Favreau, but it was fun seeing many of them despite what amounts to glorified cameos.

The movie spends too much of its time in Act 1 and raises the heat on the story very slowly, but sadly it never gets to a full boil.

The story itself borders between good and very good, but there were too many scenes that felt like promotional propaganda for the food truck industry, and several times during the movie I had to ask myself if the the funding came from the Food Channel or some kind of Food Truck Association.  Twitter should have been given top-billing along with the other stars, as the social media tool is given more lines than any of the guest stars. Sadly, even on a 32"" TV screen the pop-up conversations taking place in the Twitter stream which are intended to add to the story take more away from the overall movie because they are virtually unreadable.  Having one of the actors actually read the responses would have been more effective, and they should have known better because this is a movie destined to be more popular with the streaming audience rather than the theater-going crowd.

All said, this is a worthwhile film to stream as part of your Amazon Prime or NetFlix membership, but I wish I had been more patient and waited another couple of weeks to save myself the Amazon rental charge.",1416787200,3,1617,4.464406779661017

6443127,2,B00KQTGWPC,"It was simply not believable that a chef with such a high degree of skill and passion for artful, creative, nouvelle cuisine would be satisfied making Cuban sandwiches for the rest of his life, no matter how good the meat tastes.  And remind me WHY he broke up with his gorgeous wife (Sofia Vergara) who apparently still loves him?  And the whole gruff-dad-learning-to-bond-with-son thing was annoyingly predictable, fake and done too many times in the past to be fresh.

The best moments were some funny bits between Favreau and John Leguizamo, underutilized as a Guy Friday type. Great actors like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Oliver Platt were more or less wasted in predictable or unbelievable cameo roles.

Finally I realized that ""Chef"" was a contrived vanity project for Favreau, who wrote, directed, produced and starred.  I guess he wanted to make a movie that showed off his knife technique and cooking skills and enabled him to appear desirable and attractive to two hot actresses despite the fact that he's gained like 100 lbs.

Despite its attempt to be a feel-good success story, the contrivances and cliches of this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",1416614400,16,1203,4.930693069306931

Favreau holds his own alongside some seriously big names, several, like Robert Downey, playing quirky characters that spice up this tasty dish of a film. The food should be given it's own credit, starring alongside Favreau from beginning to end. As we left the theater, my friend was searching for a local restaurant that made Cuban sandwiches - after watching them being made, explained, served and eaten, we just HAD to have one. Pre-bought it, and when it came, made a movie night of it with the hubby - over Cuban sandwiches. :)",1416096000,,703,4.632

Since I can't stand reviews that give away even more than the trailer, I'll just say that this movie is about relationships, about remaking oneself, and about staying true to who you are.

If you're looking for a movie that shows people who care about each other and have real dialog (the Chef and his son have some VERY nice moments), then watch this movie.  If you are looking for a family friendly movie, make sure the kids are older and can handle the swearing.  This movie will remind you of the dreams you've had and the things that are most important in our life--and it's not about money.

6443264,1,B00KQTGWPC,"We started watching this movie based on its very high rating, nearly 5 stars.  I thought it would be a light-hearted comedy but it fell short in so many ways.  With such an all-star cast, you'd think it'd be better but it was SO slow and boring.  The plot was good... divorced dad needs to reconnect with his young son, needs to find a way to cook what he wants, where he wants, etc.  But the delivery was just awful.  I think there was too much time spent on unnecessary character development.  For example, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Downey Jr.:  totally minor characters that get way too much time to tell us about themselves.  I'm not an expert film critic by any means but something was off; maybe the writing? or the directing?  Save your money and look elsewhere because this will be 2 hours of your life you'll wish you never gave away.",1415923200,12,843,4.422077922077922

NOT. The food truck portion of the movie is practically a cameo and the viewer is forced to sit through over an hour of mundane, predictable, unfunny drama depicting the chef's embitterment at being forced out of the restaurant and the destruction of his reputation by the ""evil"" food critic.

But what I personally resonated so much with - and as will the 30-40something crowd - is how Favreau built up the beginning of the story to when he had to decide at that exact moment whether to stay and continue the status quo. To break what you've accomplished and do what is right in your heart is something many of us have to painfully do. Wonderful food artistry, talented supporting cast and Father-son story aside, the second half journey of building one's re-invention from the ground-up and persistence in seeing that vision through - is something we all mid-lifer's can relate to so much.

It never came (except for the tension at the beginning that sets everything in motion) and we couldn't believe we had actually found a thoughtful, funny, interesting, unique movie for adults!

Ok, ok, so some of the high-brow critics are correct in that it is not one of the deepest and most sophisticated films around. But on the other hand it pushes all of my buttons. Family, comedy, romanticism, drama, redemption, parent-child relationship, and .... FOOD!! The sound track is terrific, and it pushes all my musical buttons as well. And as for the critics, well, screw them. What do they know? Not much, as this movie so delightfully points out. Highly recommended.

My only problem with this video has nothing to do with the video itself.  This package does not come with a computer format file of the video.  Instead it comes with a long passcode that allows you to download the video from Universal Studios.  In order to do that you have to install their download software, which is not much better than malware.  And once you download the video, it is difficult to play the video.

6443384,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Im not going to lie; Chef is a movie that was kind of made to make me happy.  A foodie by nature, and by choice, there are few things to me as rewarding as eating a delicious meal, and the more experimental, interesting and unique the better.  One of the few things that is actually better than eating that meal, for me at least, is cooking it myself.  Yup, not only am I a foodie by nature, but Im a beast in the kitchen (yes, Im modest).  Food is, outside of my children, my biggest passion.  It makes me happier than anything else in the world.  Thats what I do, its how I unwind.  Open a bottle of wine, heat up the stovetop and let the minutes turn into hours as everything just melts away into a pot, pan, skillet or all of the above.

The fact that my dream is to one day own my own food truck was only icing on this cinematic cake for me.

Chef tells the story of Carl Casper, a successful chef working for a hardnosed restaurateur who is stunting Carls creativity by forcing him to stay within a box hes not comfortable staying inside.  Carl is sort of a mess, personally.  Hes arrogant, yet completely vulnerable; alienated from his son and his ex-wife and living in a world where his food is the only thing that matters because it is the only thing he can truly control.  When hes forced to cook food he isn't passionate about for an important food critic, hes annihilated in the blogs and basically feels violated, but when he fires back he winds up losing his job.  At a loss for where to go from here, he is prodded by his ex to start a food truck, cooking the food he loves and regaining his passion.  Hes hesitant, but with the proper backing and friends by his side, soon Carl is back in the game.  Finding his passion sparks a true happiness in his heart that inspired him to make amends, not only with his ex-wife, but more importantly with the son he let slip between his fingers.

Chef has its issues, especially in the third act.  The scripting up until that point feels purposeful and fresh and then it kind of falls apart, drawing to a climax that feels abrupt and unfulfilling despite being semi-fulfilling (if that makes any sense).  The fact that Scarlett Johanssons character is completely disregarded, when she was a seeming integral part of the first half, is part of the problem.  It does feel like Favreau wasn't sure how he was going to tie up loose ends, and so he just moved on to a different set of points.  But, despite this glaring issue, the film still works.  The ensemble works really well, the pacing is great, the repartee between the whole cast is incredible and the foodMY GOD the food has me salivating all over my keyboard right now.  Favreau strikes a really nice balance between arrogant and confident in his portrayal of Carl, creating a man who we can believe in.  Some have balked at Favreau casting the likes of Johansson and Vergara as his leading ladies, but in the scope of this story it makes sense.  First, Favreau is far from unattractive, and hes playing a confident, talented chef.  Women fall for that kind of man all the time, even if he has a beer gut.

With a brilliant selection of music to accompany every scene, and a fresh sense of editing to make this a very visually appealing film (I do love how social media is a plot point in the film, and it is incorporated into the look of the film as well), Chef is a film that is rewarding all the way around.  A sharp look at how misguided passions can derail our inner happiness, Chef is fun and smart and succeeds, despite losing its way a bit in the end.",1415232000,2,3570,4.337349397590361

6443422,4,B00KQTGWPC,"To be clear, really this is what would normally be a 3 out of 5 stars movie - just the really, really well made version of a 3 star movie. Although this film may not have giant ambitions or a high stakes plot, the story is very well told AND told with a lot of heart. Jon Favreau knows how to assemble a film, and so despite a low-budget, the film's production value looks amazing.

The cast us uniformly terrific. Everyone turns in great performances - even the bit turns by folks like Oliver Platt and Robert Downey, Jr.

If you like cooking, delicious food and a good family dramedy, Chef is worth a spin.

PS: On a separate rant, this film really underlines the problems with the MPAA. This movie is rated R because characters swear in a way that is accurate to how cooks talk in the kitchen. But despite that language (which I imagine kids have heard anyways), this is one of the most wholesome and loving films I've seen in years. I'd much rather have kids see something like this than the majority of the uber-violent PG-13 action movies out there.",1415059200,11,1055,4.4

Some it did not quite work.  Why a porky white man decides his life calling is to drive a Cuban sandwich truck is a mystery; the truck section of the movie is about 15 minutes until he is rescued to ... inexplicably open a Cuban restaurant.  He is married to what looks like a telanovella star and she is just highly implausible as the ex Mrs. sandwich cook.  At on point Fav asks his son ""you know what a meme is right""  Huh?

The main plot develops into a father/son thing that is not at all interesting.

The music, the scenery were just icing on the cake. Jon Favreau has a hit, both in the acting, writing and directing. His chemistry with Emjay Anthony who plays his son is perfect, along with his ex-wife in the movie Sofia Vergara. John Leguizamo was hilarious and terrific pick for his part.

6443468,5,B00KQTGWPC,"This movie really was pretty awesome!  At it's core it has two main messages.

1. Always do what you love.
2. Always make time for your family.

This movie follows Carl, played by John Favreau, as he follows his passion, which is cooking.  He wants to cook the food he wants but his boss won't let him  And this results in him leaving his job to follow his passion.  Well that and his inability to use Twitter properly.  He goes crazy and videos of him going nuts end up going viral and he is forced to leave his job.  He ends up buying a food truck and his right hand man, Martin played by John Leguizamo quits his job and helps his best friend out.

Together along with Carl's son, Emjay, they travel the country and cook the most amazing food they have ever made.  Emjay uses social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Vine, YouTube, etc, to market his dad's food truck and they end up being extremely successful.  Carl and Martin are happy they are making money and doing what they love, but Emjay is just happy to spend time with his father and having his dad teach him how to cook.

The only thing I don't understand is why did Carl and his ex-wife get a divorce?  I'm serious, they seem to be great friends, they don't argue, they both really like each other and they both adore their child.  If I had to improve this movie, I would add a scene or two about the history of their relationship to clarify just why they divorced.

But all in all it's an incredible movie!  It makes you laugh, it makes you root for these characters and also shows you how strong the bonds of family are.  Check it out!",1414886400,,1600,4.28

The cast is solid throughout with a great performance by Favreau and all of the supporting cast which includes a lot of big names including John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara and Robert Downey Jr. , among others.

Even though this is classified as a comedy, it isn't one of those laugh out loud kind, although there are some funny moments.  This is more of a family story with heart as it focuses the story on how the chef tries to connect with his young son.

With the help of his tech-savvy, 10 year old son and a loyal sous - chef from the restaurant, the van undergoes a magical transformation and becomes 'el jefe's' Cuban food magnet, thanks to the ubiquitous world of Twitter reviews.

6443613,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef is a perfect movie, but not in a good way and not in a literal way. It is shot well, Jon Favreau is fun to watch, there's decent editing, and it hits every movie mark perfectly.

Unfortunately, it's just not that interesting to watch because the characters and the script don't make any damn sense.

When I say that the movie is perfect, I mean that the characters asides from Jon's character, are flawless.

The ex-wife is understanding of him neglecting his son.
The ex-husband is willing to give Jon's character a food truck with no strings attached.
The sous chef quits his job at the restaurant to follow this man blindly.
The owner of the restaurant which Jon quits, doesn't act like a true restaurant owner.

Why? This doesn't make any sense. The movie starts off with the message about following your dream, then becomes a message about spending time with your family. The very important father/son bond.

If I were to sum up the movie it'd be this. Follow your dreams, food porn, spend time with your kids.

The problem isn't that the characters are unlikeable, no, quite the opposite. The characters are likeable including the little boy. What brings this movie down to boredom is that there's not enough conflict to make you ""feel good"" about the ending. If anything, Jon's character going off against a bad review was probably a cathartic scene for anyone who has been criticized, but it offers nothing more.

It's never clear just why the wife and him split up. From the way she acts towards him and him to her, why were they separated? It didn't make any sense.

Why did the ex-husband happily give him a food truck?

Where's the moment where Jon's character is at his deepest and darkest. He never -truly- struggles for money and never really runs into a problem that brings enough weight to it. It's all very light and fluffy like a creme brulee without the actual satisfaction of a full course meal.

This film was just an excuse to shoot and talk about food with a flimsy script built around it. Again, it's not a bad movie and the message is very pure and clear. But I really can't see myself recommending people watching this film unless they enjoy seeing things get chopped and eaten.",1414195200,,2210,4.614795918367347

The film is story driven, which is nice and the acting is first rate.  There's never a glimmer or hint that the people are playing roles.

6443638,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Jon Favreau is perhaps best known for directing the first two ""Ironman"" films.  Here he dives into what I suspect is a real passion....cooking.  He not only directs but wrote the script and stars.  He also manages to recruit some of his buddies to fill out the cast.

Favreau plays Carl Casper, a successful chef at an upscale restaurant owned by Riva (Dustin Hoffman).  When a well-known critic (Oliver Platt) is scheduled to review the restaurant, Carl wants to change up the menu and try something new.  Riva will have none of it, insisting that they stick with the tried and true dishes that people expect.  This clash eventually leads to Carl leaving the job in a huff.  Now unemployed, Carl's relationship with his 12 year old son, Percy (believably portrayed by Emjay Anthony) is strained even further.  He only gets to see his son on occasion.  Carl's ex-wife Inez is played by Sofia Vergara and they maintain a friendly relationship.  She even encourages him to try something on his own.

Inez also has another ex, Marvin (Robert Downey, Jr.) in Miami.  He has an old food truck and agrees to give it to Carl.  Evidently Inez still has a good relationship with Marvin too.  So Carl, Inez and Percy leave L. A. for Miami.  Inez seems to be independently well off but I'm never sure what it is that she does, other than look gorgeous.  I think she's an interior decorator or something.  Whatever it is, it never made sense to me.  All of this is just background noise anyway for the real star of the movie and that is the food that Carl prepares.

With help from Percy and former co-worker Martin (John Leguizamo), the trio fix up the dilapidated truck and road trip it back to L. A. with numerous stops along the way (New Orleans, Austin, etc.) where they enjoy the local culture while serving long lines of people, Cubanos.  With Percy's social media skills, he's quickly assigned marketing responsibility.  This is lighthearted fare to be sure and very enjoyable to watch.  Favreau moves things along quickly, yet the 114 minute running time seems just a little long.  I just wanted to ditch the popcorn and find an authentic Cuban sandwich.  ""Chef"" gets an `R' rating for some of the language including a few F-bombs, but it isn't offensive.  Watch for Amy Sedaris who plays Carl's agent.  She's a hoot in her short screen time.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p resolution and has the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent throughout.  Digitally shot, it maintains a film-like quality, never overly bright.  Night scenes look very good with proper black levels.  The film locations change from L. A. to Miami, New Orleans and Austin but there is a consistency throughout the film.  Audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  As you might expect, the film isn't heavy on action but dialog centered.  It is solid and easily understood, coming primarily from front center.  Surrounds come into play with some of the crowd scenes and the music of course.  The best perhaps when Gary Clark, Jr. is seen at the stop in Austin.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Favreau and some deleted scenes, including some Amy Sedaris outtakes.",1414022400,,3219,4.741877256317689

6443671,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Great movie

I see a man cooking and after 10 years losing his passion, he gains it back and the process is entertaining.
You see his passion for cooking and food in the making of a simple breakfast for his son...the checking of the hash browns
you see it in the simple Cuban sandwich....the point being food doesn't have to be artsy well presented, decorated and then lauded over by food critic and patron alike for it to be good..it's about the passion

I will echo some reviewers comments there are some not quite believable moments in the movie as the scene with Scarlett Johansson, but then he's cooking for his love, his woman...he's passionate and expressing it through the care he shows
in cooking for her a small masterpiece bowl of pasta.

The cameo performances fit nicely, the well knowns playing bit parts, non-supporting yet important roles that fill in the movie
I found it very enjoyable (cooking a bit myself). because in a sea of post-apocalyptic themed movies that last few years, horrible comic book remakes and re-hashed, unimaginative themes that are little more than a 110 minutes of product placement.

If you find the story lacking or less than genuine...watch it for the macro food porn throughout the movie....I garnered several things, having a few of my own ideas on cooking up something different.

A family-friendly flick, for those with teens or middle-school aged kids (as long as you don't mind frequent uses of adult language - the swearing is profuse, but not excessively vulgar).

Sometimes synchronistic events propel us into change in our lives, in ways we never expect, but which lead us down a wonderful new path...as happened in this story.
Change is portrayed wonderfully here.  Once the main character lets go and seeks new solutions, his life and the lives of those around him change dramatically in wonderful and heart warming ways. Both sides, the frustrations and joys are shown, which
gives the story a human and believable quality.  (Don't watch when hungry...some of the food looks great.)",1413676800,,650,5.046728971962617

If you are a cook you can watch the movie with the sound off and still have a great time because Favreau really nailed the food & cooking scenes. This isn't food porn, it's food erotica, the classier version, like Big Night or Eat Drink Man Woman. However, DON'T watch the movie with the sound off. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Not quite five stars only because the setup takes a bit of time to before the movie reveals itself as a classic road movie (think Hope & Crosby) and the hero doesn't really undergo any ordeal more challenging than losing a job he hated anyway.",1413676800,,720,4.421052631578948

6443812,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I'm confused by the people posting that it wasn't appropriate for young children....the movie is clearly marked rated ""R"". That said I really enjoyed it. It was funny, had a couple emotional parts...seemed pretty believable to me if the Chef was originally as good as the critic claimed and was now the twitter sensation I could definitely see crowds of people coming out to assess his food skills for themselves. Plus, who doesn't love food off of a truck? Okay, not a serious question as I know it's not all awesome. This wasn't a cooking show so the food was not the star but when it was on display it looked seriously good...right down to the grilled cheese!

If you are looking for a bit of entertainment in the form of feel good, breakdown, pick me up, figure out a way to do what you love for the rest of your life type of party...then check out the movie for yourself. You might not give it 5 stars but I don't think it should get less than 3....even if you didn't check the rating first, or watch the trailer to get an idea of what it's about.",1413417600,,1052,4.340101522842639

Having worked in restaurants for years I felt that all of the restaurant scenes rang true. I thought Dustin Hoffman had a great smaller part. The movie started losing me a bit when social media became a major ""character"" in the plot. This will obviously keep happening in books and movies because that's the way life is now.

As the movie builds toward the ending, it becomes more and more Hollywood. I recommend the movie, but don't feel it was as great as it could have been, had it maintained a more independent style, rather than slipping into a sappy Hollywood formula.",1413417600,,677,4.641666666666667

6443822,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef is the story of a formerly acclaimed chef (Jon Favreau, who also wrote, produced and directed) who has become disenfranchised, bitter and jaded with the food he is forced to cook in a restaurant he doesn't own.  After a hot-shot food blogger, played by Oliver Platt writes a scathing and damaging review of his food the two get embroiled in a heated and well-publicized flame war on social media.  A challenge is issued for the blogger to return and try the Chef's new inspired menu. However, because of a disagreement with the owner, Chef loses his job and cannot cook the new food.  The blogger is served the uninspired menu once again; and Chef returns at the last minute and gives a heated, passionate speech at the blogger about how the blogger doesn't know anything. The fight is recorded and goes viral online.  The heart of this story is what happens next; The chef, now desperate to cook and unemployable due to negative publicity is left with only one option; open a food truck, cook what he wants and travel the country.  That alone would make a fantastic story, and it does.  A bonus element that works well here is the subplot involving his young 10-year old son who he teaches to cook and ends up reconnecting with.  Strong performances all around from Favreau and the young actor playing the son.  Supporting turns from John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara and Bobby Cannavale are also worth watching. Robert Downey Jr makes a short appearance and is excellent.

Scarlett Johansson is also in this film; but her character is not well developed and she has little to do.  Overall this movie is easy to watch, is well written and will not leave you disappointed.  The one drawback of this movie is its impossible to watch it and not end up starving from all the delicious food featured in the movie. Well worth a watch.",1413417600,,1830,4.6521739130434785

6443848,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I just finished watching this film, and it is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in the past year. Jon Favreau stars as a chef who takes pride in his creative work, sometimes to the detriment of his family. The owner of his restaurant starts to stifle his creativity, which ultimately damages his reputation and leads to significant turmoil (but ultimately growth and happiness, too). The story is engaging and is well-seasoned with an excellent soundtrack (mostly Latin music) and a hefty helping of food porn. Seriously, I swear you can practically taste some of the dishes they're cooking, and I wouldn't be surprised if I gained 10 lbs just watching.

Although the story is about a chef, I like to think that the film's themes will resonate with many others. It's refreshing to see someone break free of an stifling employer and work a job they love on their own terms. I wonder if this is how Jon Favreau approached it; since Swingers, he's certainly made plenty of blockbusters, but this film came across as a labor of love.

On a final note: I don't usually like Jon Leguizamo's stuff-- not his fault, he's usually cast in some obnoxious roles-- but he did an awesome job in this film as El Jefe's friend and sous chef. His acting and personality added a lot of character and flavor.",1413244800,,1298,4.639130434782609

It was a good attempt to create a movie that wasn't too fluffy but missed the mark on providing something to reflect on.

The film contains some men behaving badly, underaged drinking, and colorful language, but at it's heart, it's a movie about family and food. I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to foodies, long-married couples, and families with children over 13.

6443881,2,B00KQTGWPC,"The only virtue is that it contains no violence and can be watched as a light form of entertainment without needing to pay attention to the plot. All made of cliches and predictable tricks including re-marrying the ex-wife, cute kid who handles the social media better than the parents, old buddies who give up remunerative jobs to help the main character rebuid his career out of a food truck in Miami. Some token latin culture hints, so weak and so embarrassing, to give credence to the Miami part of the plot. A sort of infomercial for Miami Beach, but just the art deco frontline. They even eat at Versailles on Calle 8. Nonetheless, they cannot spend too much time in Miami, the truck travels all the way to New Orleans to sell Cuban sandwiches! Is this movie made for international audience who knows America from a postcard? Could give 3 stars because you feel only you waste $5.00 but not outright robbed.",1413158400,2,913,4.6419753086419755

I think some editing in the the first half of the movie may have helped, as the entire first half is the set up for the comeback story.  Also not billing it as a ""...hilarious all-star cast in this inspiring comedy..."" , would allow people to know what to expect.  We had been looking for a comedy diversion, after 48 minutes my husband was more depressed than when we started the movie and was uninterested in seeing the rest.

While the focus is on cooking, keep your eyes peeled, because the plot does a drive-by on family issues, technology proliferation, employer/employee relations, and American culture in a couple of  languages. I literally snorted and laughed out loud several times and watched over my husband's shoulder for a re-run later.  My only reservation is that there's quite a bit of casual bad language in the movie, which keeps me from recommending it for families. Ironically, at one point the main character is concerned about how/where his 10-year-old is hearing bad language.  Uh, at the movies, maybe?  So pay attention to the rating on this one, but I believe it's possible for adults to chew the meat and spit out the bones on that issue (so to speak -- it's a cooking movie, right?)",1413072000,,810,4.840579710144928

The characters are believable (especially Emjay Anthony -- how refreshing to have a child played as a child!), likable, and we found ourselves really rooting for ""Jefe"" to succeed. This movie could've been corny, or cloying or overly melodramatic; instead it was as wonderfully balanced as the Chef's food creations seem to be in the story. Not too sweet, not too spicy... just right!

The relationship between father and son was very good in it's development. This movie can be watched by young, hip, and old alike. Great soundtrack and visuals.

6444027,5,B00KQTGWPC,"My husband and I watched this one Sunday afternoon, and first he looked at me and said ""Chef? ""Who's in it?"" I got the typical reluctant response that I get, when I want him to watch something he was unfamiliar with. I had a friend tell me about this film at the local Goodwill thrift store, where many of the regulars talk about everything, including movies, music, and politics. (There is a film waiting to be written on this sub- culture) My friend saw it on a return flight from Italy, and said it was a cool little movie. That was all I needed to hear, as i trusted his opinion. Being familiar with John Favreau's work, i was pretty sure we would find something interesting about Chef, and we sure did. Certainly not a big giant blockbuster film, like Iron Man, but a very well written story, and just a very enjoyable movie for a Sunday afternoon, or anytime really. I like the rapport of Favreau and John Leguizamo's characters. I don't understand why Leguizamo's career isn't bigger. He's great How can you not appreciate a film that has Robert Downey Jr. and Dustin Hoffman in it, albeit small, but powerful roles. Just watch it..but have a sandwich first.

Loved this movie. Even comedian Russell Peters makes an appearance.  Soundtrack was fun and if you enjoyed it you can buy it here on Amazon and it comes with a recipe for making CUBANOS.

Jon Favreau (Writer/Director) has a winner here and I hope he sprinkles in more movies like this to go with his blockbusters.

6444079,3,B00KQTGWPC,"I really expected more from Favreau and cast. I'm guessing that Dusty pissed off somebody and got tossed from the set, he's only in a few scenes with Favreau as  the bean counting restauranteur who butts heads with Chef over a creative menu versus a  money making old, tired menu. Favreau cooks up a storm and you get to see some good looking dishes that never get served. Then this milk-toast story leaves LA and moves to Miami with too much annoying Cuban music that's there to spice up the hum-drum life on board a food truck and turns into a three-way buddy flick with Chef bonding with his son and his faithful souse chef buddy. His beautiful ex-wife is even more beautiful than Scarlet, the hostess at Dusty's restaurant.  They get tossed from South Beach, move along to Louisiana and Austin Texas cooking, texting and eating their way across the country and back to LA where the restaurant reviewing blogger, who causes Faverau to go postal, and ultimately viral on social media, offers to back him in a new restaurant he's just acquired with the new found wealth from selling his popular food blog to AOL for $10 million. I think this could have been much more interesting if we could have seen more interaction with Hoffman and Chef and the kid and his wife and buddy. And I can't believe that Chef isn't interested money, just cooking as he claims. R. Downey Jr. is wasted in his short appearance as an eccentric in Florida who sells Chef his cookmobile. I suppose its difficult to make a movie about food trucks and bloated ""El Jefe"" Chefs. I'm more curious about these small slices of life in the city and on the road but the take away was that Cubanos, the Cuban version of a really good looking press cooked pork, cheese, mustard and pickle hoagies, will kill you unless eating them with a glass of Lipator or a side of Red Rice Yeast.

6444132,4,B00KQTGWPC,"""Chef"" starts out as a rather convincing kitchen action flick, and manages to depict the high tension environment of that setting, while interspersing enough glossy images of food that one still thinks cooking might be a fun way to make a living (been there, done that, no thanks).  But, passion, we soon learn, has been made submissive to profit, as the restaurant's owner (Dustin Hoffman) didn't like the way his clientele rejected the Chef's previous attempts to add sweetbreads to the menu, and won't let him change the crowd pleasing formula, even though the big time L.A. restaurant critic who'd discovered the Chef has announced he's coming to dinner.  So El Jefe, as he's styled himself (he's got the Cubana bombshell wife [Sofia Vergara] but he speaks no Spanish) obediently prepares the Standards and gets roundly panned in a review that quickly goes from denouncing the food to an ad hominem rebuke of the Chef.  Unfortunately, this is when El Jefe discovers Twitter.  He doesn't know how it works, doesn't listen to anyone who does, and becomes an internet sensation with one tweet---and not a good one.

So now he's got some time off...

It's here that El Jefe finally realizes (with some help from his ex wife---Vergara) that he needs to be a father to his son (Emjay Anthony) and for once, he starts listening.  It is here that the movie changes course---his relationship with his son becomes the center of the film, and the cooking becomes the vehicle, literally, as they buy a food truck in Miami.  It turns out that the kid is a whiz with social media and now the internet starts working for El Jefe, instead of against him.  Of course, by now the savory element of the film has been completely replaced with dulces and we're bombing for the exit like the Giant Dipper coming off the top of its big hill, and the movie has been about as much fun as said roller coaster, albeit with out most of the twists and drops.

This film is pure entertainment, it's not meant to be taken too seriously.  We could ask why there are only two women of note in the film and both are Barbie dolls, and both are meant to be ornaments to El Jefe, who gives us no reason to understand why (in real life) either would want such a physically unattractive, and self centered, guy.  We could point out that, like the food in the restaurant that starts the plot rolling, the soundtrack is pure crowd pleaser too, nothing unusual, or challenging.  Or that, for the millionth time, Los Angeles' Mexico/Central American latin culture is shoved aside and ignored for a Caribbean centric culture that isn't nearly so prevalent there, and it's not like Mexican Food lacks color or is dominated by tofu and wheat grass...  We could, but at this point, why bother?

What this film offers is rarely seen in a Hollywood product:  A father who fathers.  Once the relationship scenes get going, the kid stays a kid, not some precocious brat;  and the hitherto self absorbed Dad morphs into someone who sees what he has to do, and does it, and does it well.  Thus, when we get to the scene with the Chef's knife, and the burnt Cubano;  when Dad gives his talk, it really works.  That alone scored points with me.

I'll definitely be watching this again, it was fun right out of the gate and managed to stay fun all the way back home.",1412467200,,3314,4.590831918505942

In the end he achieves even greater success with his culinary skills.  But it's dull, dull, dull.  We are glad that he eventually succeeds, but along the way nothing happens.  We see him refurbishing an old truck, being friendly and decent and reasonable throughout his difficulties, but again, nothing happens.  We all love happy endings, and we have one here, but something exciting and stimulating, maybe suspenseful, needs to happen along the way.  Not here.",1412467200,,708,4.801652892561983
6444134,1,B00KQTGWPC,This movie is terrible.  It's kind of like Jon Favreau wanted to make a movie just like the Louie CK show if Louie were an annoying chef and had no sense of humor.  Really awful.  Turned it off half-way through. Wish they accepted returns on these instant videos. Nice library though Amazon!,1412467200,6,291,4.5576923076923075
6444135,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I cook and can appreciate how much time they took to get the life of a chef right.  The clever use, and misuse, of social media adds to the endearing qualities of chef Carl Casper who is definitely good at cooking and reminds us that unplanned change and the accompanying humility often provide the clarity necessary to help us reconnect with the things and people in our busy lives that really matter.  Bravo to Jon Favreau for creating an authentic instant hit that both tugs on our heart strings and instructs us to get back to the business of family, food and laughter.",1412467200,,573,4.553398058252427

It has fantastic soundtrack (which is worth owning), and the food......you could almost smell it! This was the best movie that I had seen all summer and I saw it multiple times.

For those of us who love food and everything related to it, this movie is like a validation. I so understand the chefs passion and conflicts. This movie was inspirational. Find something you love and don't compromise. Just do it. And when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. And the soundtrack!!! Original and bumping!!! If you love a feel good movie, this one is it. it's not over the top and it's believable. This is what I want to see on the big screen.

6444144,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Overall pretty enjoyable, feel good kind of movie. Only two critiques is that it's probably the most blatant advert for a company/product (twitter in this instance) that i've ever seen (apart from the lego movie). The integration of Twitter into the central storyline is pretty well done overall and the subtle(ish) messaging around how to use it, positioning as a better social experience quite authentic, but the frequency perhaps could have been reduced. The second thing is the ending. It was very weak and cheesey - Hollywood at it's most extreme (i.e. everyone is happy, beautiful, everything works out wonderfully, we all live happily ever after etc). Bit of a shame after the fun ride the movie takes you on",1412467200,,715,4.966666666666667

It's just a wonderful experience. It's got all the classic themes - loss, redemption, finding truth on the road, learning what really matters - yet avoids maudlin or trite expressions.

6444184,3,B00KQTGWPC,"The ""It's Okay"" 3 star rating describes this movie accurately; there is nothing particularly off-putting about this film, it's a feel-good movie that ultimately is not that interesting overall.

Warning - minor plot giveaway: I was not convinced that a professional Chef, demotivated by not being allowed by the restaurant owner to push the boundaries of gourmet cooking, would really be that fulfilled by making and selling quality sandwiches out of a food truck. Also was the film sponsored by Twitter? Good grief - a commercial for Twitter could not have done a better job of promoting the service.

By all means rent it and watch it while browsing the web, Tweeting or text messaging - this movie will not keep you that interested.",1412294400,2,735,4.919354838709677

Some small roles like Scarlett and Downey Jr. help keep the film going and keep it away from becoming mundane. And I honestly feel this is a great film to watch with your kids as long as you don't mind a little language.

Also very much liked the 'road trip' that brought Favreau's character back to his roots and restored his passion for his innovations in cooking. A happy movie that is such a nice respite from giant monsters and computer generated effects. This is a REAL story about real people who experience real things.

The food is awesome,and I didn't know it was part of the story before watching it, but I have developed a new hope for the next generation and their integration of technology into daily life in a way that isn't slack-jawed screen-drooling.

6444251,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Product placements are nothing new with movies, Chef does take that to the extreme with Twitter, in fact it's not even being subtle about it, the logo, and tweets appear constantly on top of the footage, (some even pointless as you can't even read the text of the tweet ), reinforced by footage of things like actual small birds taking off when something positive is done using that social network by a character on screen. It is annoying and perhaps a bit of an insult to the intelligence of movie viewers, but I didn't find it ruined the movie though, granted they should mention on the DVD cover, funded by Twitter or something, but if you can accept the obvious advertising it's still a decent film to watch.

It's not a comedy, it's not an action film, it's not a romantic film you can score points by watching with your girlfriend, so what is it? Basically a what did we learn today film. A re-evaluate our priorities, what's important, especially in relation to a father son relationship. Like say the song Cats in the Cradle did, this one revolves around a father who takes a while to catch on to the fact that all his son really cares about, is wanting to spend time with him. Sort of a road trip film, of a father, his son and friend, with food and of course as mentioned, the constant use of Twitter.

The majority of the film revolves around the character Carl, a now overweight and over it all former next big thing Chef (played by Jon Favreau). Other characters only appear on screen when interacting with Carl meaning the big name actors which one or more of might be the reason you picked this up, don't have much screen time at all, such as Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr and to a lesser extent Sofia Vergara. Besides Favereau the other two actors on screen for the majority of the film are John Liguizamo (who plays his colleague and best mate Martin) and a young actor Emjay Anthony who plays Percy the son. Both these, actors do a great believable job in their roles, but as mentioned their names aren't promoting this film on the DVD cover so you may be disappointed they take up the majority of screen time. The big name actors, do a very good with their small parts though, and I especially liked how Vegara speaks more in her natural voice than the exaggerated accent of her Modern Family character which is something she hasn't always done in other films (such as New Years Eve).

I enjoyed the film though, granted it was predictable in parts and I would have preferred if they had invented a fictional social media company, Twitter usage as the sole social media network probably will also date this film very fast when Twitter fades away and is replaced by the next fad in the future. I recommend everyone gives Chef a go, perhaps you can make a game of and bet with everyone else watching it with you as to the number of blatant Twitter promotions that will appear and the person furthest from the correct number has to cook everyone else dinner or something.",1411430400,,3010,4.519266055045872

Essentially we have a middle aged artist at the end of his creative rope, burned out and bored with turning out the same 10 year old menu every night. So far so good. The desperation and frustration feel authentic and human.

Then comes Twitter.

About twenty minutes in, the subject of the film changes from midlife angst to the wonderful marketing potential of Twitter. I'm really not exaggerating. First the Chef shoots himself in the foot by failing to understand how to use Twitter (shame!). But in the end he redeems himself both financially and (gag) spiritually by fully embracing the power of social media (not Facebook mind you---not a word about THAT---TWITTER!).

Of course if it had been Amazon and Jeff Bezos instead of Twitter, well then the advertising would have been laudable and my feelings would be very different. But Bezos isn't crass enough to trick people into watching films about Amazon. He doesn't need to. But that is another story...

That was probably pretty helpful for a lot of food truck owners when trying to gather a crowd for their truck.

Regardless, it was a ""feel good"" movie.  Dad and the kid were cute, Mom was hot, everything was resolved nicely.  Not everything has to be a political statement/I hate myself and want to die/let's bash some demographic kind of movie.  Get over yourselves.  It was a cute movie!",1411257600,,647,4.565217391304348
6444274,1,B00KQTGWPC,"I simply cannot fathom all the five star reviews on this film.  It is truly terrible.  The acting is sub-par (especially given the caliber of actors involved), the story is shallow and pointless, and I couldn't help but feel like I was being subliminally violated by a not so subtle Twitter commercial.  Though Favreau claims publicly that Twitter had nothing to do with the film, I can't help but wonder if he sold his soul for some future high priced deal.  The product placement is non-stop.  Utterly endless.  Almost every moment of the movie is cluttered with marketing for Twitter.  The main character (a very boring Favreau) is a fat washed-up but somehow simultaneously brilliant chef who has strangely never heard of Twitter (which the movie insinuates is partly the reason why he is a failure).  Only when Favreau ""discovers"" Twitter and how to use it correctly does he finally become a success (magical Twitter even rekindles his relationship with his ex-wife).  Sound mind numbingly stupid and grotesque?  Yes, it is, but hey, at least you'll have several overly long scenes of actors explaining in detail HOW TO USE TWITTER to help cheer you up.

People thought the Google backed 'The Internship' was a horrible sell-out, but for some reason, seem to like this movie.  I should say reviewers on the web liked this movie - I've never met anyone in person who liked it.  Maybe I just can't build up enough superficial interest to care about the whole absurd ""foodie"" subculture, and perhaps that's why I ""don't get it"".  But frankly, I know a good indie film when I see one, and this had no redeeming qualities.  I understand that low and mid-range budget films have basically died out over the past decade because of the poor economy, but that doesn't mean we have to settle for this kind of sewage.

I suspect that some folks will simply blow off this review with the assumption that I am taking it all too seriously, and just couldn't grasp the ""uplifting"" feel good atmosphere of the flick.  They would be wrong.  This movie is not uplifting.  Not a single character is interesting, or endearing.  The writing feels like it was slapped together with no care or love for the process.  And good God!  The freaken' Twitter cultism was so distracting that I forgot all about the fact that Favreau was trying to make a film rather than an infomercial.  I come away from it feeling like the makers of the movie think that their audience is too ignorant to understand that they have just paid money to have two hours of their life siphoned from their veins.  And maybe the filmakers are right...

Additional Thought:

I just read a news article which discussed the exposure of Facebook ""Like-Farms"", a strategy large companies are using to artificially build up fake ""likes"" for particular Facebook pages, thus leading real people to believe that the page is legitimately popular.  The strategy involves paying groups of subcontracted web users to go out and pretend as if they enjoy a certain product or brand.  I had to come back to this review because the level of cardboard cutout five star responses to this movie feels suspicious to me.  I'm starting to wonder if there are Amazon ""like farms"" out there as well...

I suggest people read Forbes' article 'Fake Reviews: Amazon's Rotten Core' to understand exactly where all the hollow five star reviews are really coming from.  For $6000 bucks a company can buy up to 300 five star reviews.",1411257600,18,3453,4.762626262626263

When I say commercial, I don't mean some product placement, I mean Twitter is a central character to the plot. And far far worse are these strange, creepy instructional pauses in the film, where characters halt the plot to explain to the audience step by step, how different trends in the internet work. The awkward plot pauses feel like a school film strip.

I believe all the good reviews of this movie are fake and I further think the fake reviewers will overwhelm this review with flags to remove it, otherwise there would be dozens of other reviews that say exactly what mine says.

Being sold in this way is so insulting and feels somehow Orwellian and disturbing
.
Spoiler below;

Twitter changes the main character's life, initially ruining it because he doesn't use Twitter properly.

Then when taught via instructional meant for the audience he becomes an internet celebrity, his business booms , he and his ex begin to tweet each other, all of this also shown through birds that tweet and fly from tree to tree each time a ""tweet"" is made. He gets his wife back, reconnects with his son, he and his nemesis bury the hatchet from their twitter war, bond over a discussion of what twitter has done for them and how it can be used. The main character becomes self employed with his no longer ex wife and son and the birds tweet from tree to tree as it is all tweeted in the end.

Two stars because I still love all the actors -money is money

6444297,2,B00KQTGWPC,"I might have given this film three stars if it weren't for the unapologetic level of ego and vanity that is present in every scene. On it's own, it's not completely a bad film, but it's also not a very good one, either. The story follows every cliche of scriptwriting to the letter, and there is a glaring lack of unique characters and no real meat on the plot.

The story concerns a chef named Carl. Carl is a genius. How do we know this? Never mind about that, he just is. Look at all of these beautiful shots of food. Carl's genius is smothered by his boss, Dustin Hoffman (phoning it in like it ain't nobody's business), who demands that Carl only cook the same tired, uninspired menu that's he's cooked for years. This gets Carl a bad review from a big time critic. Carl loses his top in public, inspiring a viral video, and he loses his job and is forced to work on a food truck, serving greasy sandwiches on the streets of Miami. Guess how his return to humble roots works out? The answer will not surprise you.

Although uninspired and rote beyond all reason, what really knocks this movie down a notch is its weird level of pompousness. Written, directed, and starring Jon Favreau, the movie is obviously a cheeky metaphor about his own life. Favreau was once a rising indie auteur who has since become a huge name in Hollywood with blockbuster hits like ELF, IRONMAN, and THE AVENGERS. Favreau himself even said that this little flick was his attempt to get back to his roots, to stay ""grounded,"" and to tell the story of a guy trying to develop ""an original and creative voice.""

How disappointing, then, that this is one of the least original and creative films I've seen all year. And as far as staying ""grounded,"" let's just say that Carl and his story smack of delusional vanity. His ex-wife is the inexplicably rich and gorgeous Sofia Vergara, who still pines for him from afar. His girlfriend is the inexplicably kind and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, who is totally cool with a friends with benefits type situation. When he loses his job, he is (carte blanche) given a food truck by his ex's ex, played by Robert Downey Jr. (in a scene that is simultaneously so nutty and dismissive that it had to be improvised in one take as part of some favor garnered from the set of IRONMAN). Even though Carl is a complete jerk to nearly everyone he knows -- including his tow-headed son (one of the best actors in the movie) -- he's portrayed as a misunderstood genius who just needs to be given a chance to let his flower blossom, an opportunity he finds in the humble guise of a food truck chef (a low-rent job that he only keeps long enough to get his groove back).

The parallels to filmmaking and Favreau himself are impossible to ignore, and they make the film silly in a really self-congratulatory way, which is doubly painful when the movie unswervingly follows the same tired plot as thousands others before it. Lots of people have called this a ""charming, feel good movie,"" but that only really applies if your tastes require zero complexity or depth.

How many of us are unhappy at our jobs???...., not unhappy because they are bad jobs, unhappy because we know how to make it a better place to work, but are stifled by upper-management (many of you are nodding - YEP).

This is a movie that I believe will be enjoyable for the entire family (though there are a couple of words that some may be sensitive to).  I watched it with my young aspiring Chef (my daughter), and it was a complete delight.  Great acting, a world-class cast of characters, and the little kid steals the show.

6444304,4,B00KQTGWPC,"It seems only fitting that I should write this review as a recipe.

INGREDIENTS:
1. 1 Jon Favreau, back with renewed vigour, enthusiasm, and infectious energy.
2. 1 Sofia Vergara, as gorgeous and strong as usual as Chef Casper's ex-wife.
3. 1 John Leguizamo, stealing the scenes as Carl's best friend and sous-chef.
4. 1 cup despicable Dustin Hoffman.
5. 1 Oliver Platt, subtle as a cruel food critic.
6. A sprinkling of Scarlett Johannson, add Robert Downey Jr. to taste.
7. A cup of folk songs.
8. A sprinkling of Americana.
9. A whole lot of food.
10. 1 food truck. Buy used.
11. A dash of Twitter.
12. 1 bag of conflict. Use a handful, discard the rest.

METHOD:
1. Combine Jon Favreau and food in gorgeously shot, mouth-watering food preparation scenes.
2. Combine cast in large bowl. Mix until the charm and charisma settles in stiff peaks.
3. Place Jon Favreau in food truck. Add precocious, tech-savvy son.
4. Add in the Twitter, folk songs, and Americana. Mix thoroughly.
5. Saute ingredients in morals: integrity, creativity, and happiness.
6. Add in just the right amount of treacle.
7. Discard conflict, replace with humor, heart, and cubanos.
8. Season with product-placement, to taste.

RESULT:
(Let's see how many food-related puns I can get in before I run out of things to say). Serves crowds, and pleases them. If you're looking for a delicious time at the movies, consume Chef. If you're looking for a funny, heart-warming, treacly but infectiously entertaining film, ""taste"" this movie. Jon Favreau's passion for what he does is infectious. His performance is the crucial molten centre of the lava cake: it could have been so easy to get wrong, but when it's done right, its undeniably impressive. Now, his movie isn't perfect. There's no real conflict in the third act, it's a little sappy, and there's some inexplicable Twitter product placement. But Jon Favreau delivers a heartfelt film about doing what you love, the entire audience will be hungering for more.

6444307,5,B00KQTGWPC,"I loved ""Chef,"" written by, directed by, and starring Jon Favreau. It's earthy, funny, and sweet. I have seen complaints from people who thought it was a ""family"" movie and brought their young kids...the movie is rated R! So ...why on earth would they think it was okay for kids? (There is swearing, entirely believable and appropriate cursing and F-bombs.) The cast is 100% terrific, featuring many A-list stars such as Sophia Vergara, Dustin Hoffman, the great John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, and the kid who plays Jon Favreau's son is worth the ticket price alone.

This lovely, fun, sweet story with real guts is obviously a labor of love by Favreau, who trained to do his own cooking for the movie. I really enjoyed this story of a passionate chef who is at a personal bottom when he realizes he can take control of his life, he can be happy, he can cook the food he loves, and he can be a good father.

Recommendation: Hells yeah. Hollywood, please please please, make more movies like this: adult, character driven, funny, touching, all American stories. Loved it.",1409961600,,1091,4.797872340425532

6444309,5,B00KQTGWPC,"The snooty film critic in me might complain that Chef is a bit too predictable, the characters too 2-dimensional and the whole film just not very real. After all, this is the movie where an overweight Jon Favreau has written his own fantasy of having Sofia Vergara as the ex-wife who still pines for him, while Scarlett Johansson serves as his interim girlfriend. Well done, Jon!

But those complaints, while valid to a point, would ignore the immense pleasure and enjoyment provided by Chef, which I saw twice in theaters and now intend to buy on Blu-ray. Yes, I liked it that much. And in the midst of a summer that seem filled with especially dreadful news, I enjoyed the escape of this quintessential, feel-good, ""road trip"" movie, filled with characters I loved, bromance and romance, an awesome soundtrack, plenty of fun and good times, plus a big-hearted plot that leaves you feeling all is right with the world when the final credits roll. It's also a hoot to see that Favreau was able to recruit his ""friends""--who just happen to be the biggest names in Hollywood -- to star in his low-budget indie flick. Nice to see that sometimes it isn't always about the money.

The biggest surprise about Chef is that more people did not see it during its theatrical release, despite great reviews and very positive word-of-mouth. So if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and either rent it or buy it--you can thank me for the smiles later. Chef is one of those ""small"" movies that I predict will becoming increasingly popular and beloved over time.

6444310,4,B00KQTGWPC,"This is a satisfying ""feel good"" movie that really plays up Cuban-American culture. What really impressed me was that all the Cuban cuisine, music and way of life featured in the film comes from the United States. The mother country was never even mentioned or shown. When they want to show Cuba, they show Miami.

The story does have a bit of a dark side though. While the protagonist is dedicated to his craft and to his son (and eventually to his ex-wife, too) he seems a bit of a child himself. He is selfish, petulant, short-sighted, disloyal, unfaithful and not a very good father. The perfect timely hero: flawed. Other than that the movie is really good. :)

Carl is a chef who gets hammered with an on line review. He gets into a Twitter war with the critic leading to his termination from work. Carl most go from being with Molly (Scarlett Johansson) ""will have sex for food"" to living off the charity of his still loving ex-wife Inez (Sofa Vergara). I wish I had his bad luck.

Carl succumbs to his wife's idea of obtaining a food truck which causes him to bond with his son and other formulaic ideas to the point of nausea. The problem I had with the script and film is that it tried so hard to create a feel good formula film it seemed plastic and fake. The characters and situation never seemed real, which makes this nothing more than a substandard comedy.

And not a moment too soon.  Wink.

As has been said, this is a classic feel good movie sitting on a foundation of To Thine Own Self be True/Being Faust is the beginning of the end (which, I believe it is).

The film is brilliantly cast, and Mr. Favreau brings his usual, manic, pseudo improv vibe to the main character.  Eros affirming Latin music tracks & performances populate.

What could be bad?  Well, perhaps not bad, but for me, just too predictable to earn my full engagement.  But, given what pervades re special effects driven blockbusters.....I guess people are starved for some version of human and feel good not involving the destruction of giant mutant aliens.

I was totally entertained.  The characters were believable, as was the situations they dealt with.  There were a couple scenes where I believe the character in question was a bit over the top, but it didn't detract too much.

What did detract, and the reason for leaving off a star, was the amount of unnecessary f-bombs (including one spoken by a child, which I never find funny), and one set of dialogue that refers to women in a very derogatory manner.  Most of this occurs in the beginning of the movie.  (And yes, before you flame me in the comments, I already know I am old-fashioned, or whatever name you want to call me.  If the language doesn't bother you, great.  But I like to be informed of such things beforehand, so I included it in my review for others who might want to know as well.)

From the director of Iron Man and Cowboys and Aliens comes a story about a chef, Carl Casper (John Favreau), who receives a scathing review by a critic and is devastated by it. His son Percy (Emjay Anthony) has been feeling neglected as his father devotes so much of his time at work that he feels like his father has lost touch with him. With the support of his ex-wife, Inez (Sofia Vergara) and his friend Molly (Scarlett Johansson), Carl heads out to Florida where it all began and repairs a food truck and heads on a journey to discovery and to bring himself and his son closer then ever before. With a star-studded cast and heart, director John Favreau presents a film that feels caring and natural that every family should go see.

Not only did Favreau film and produce the movie but he had also partaken as the main lead as chef Carl. Watching Carl go through the ropes and feeling so passionate about his food that you genuinely care for him. The supporting cast was phenomenal and went into their characters with ease. Coming in at 115 minutes, never did the movie feel bloated or overdone, as the pacing and writing flowed throughout the running time. We also got to see Dustin Hoffman and Robert Downy Jr. in smaller roles; yet they played their characters with class. Its nice to see Downy and Favearu together in one scene as it compliments their successes while working together on other projects. And Downys character is no different from what weve seen in Iron Man.

There was even an incorporation of Twitter that showcased how powerful social media and word-of-mouth can be. Favearus character was so out of touch with social media that created a fiasco; leading to a great scene between he and critic Ramsey Mitchel (Oliver Platt) at the restaurant. The son, Percy, and Carl worked well together as it showed a generational gap where one grew up with technology, while the other hasn't fully embraced it. The film almost had a how-to guide in spreading the word and building a business from scratch.

It has to be mentioned that the sound and cinematography was amazing. With the added flavor of Latin music and actor John Leguizamo as Martin, helped make the movie that more entertaining. What you get from the movie is nothing but art at work.  As the food truck traveled across the country; including New Orleans, you get a sense of adventure by the cultural differences in the foods they prepared.

With heart, soul, and flavor, John Favreau delivered an excellent performance as did the rest of the cast. The movie is a story about passion and respect for those you care about most. Although the movie is a marketed as a comedy, it does so by not being overly done or forced. An incredible movie that will surely be remembered and watched for years to come. As a low budget film, Favreau should be pleased with himself by putting together a great story that only comes from within.",1405123200,,2963,4.6558317399617595
6444325,5,B00KQTGWPC,"This indie film is a total delight.  I have seen it twice now, and even enjoyed it more the second time.  A stellar cast and great acting
and script make this light comedy--drama a smiler from start to finish, with plenty of wonderful food for the food porn crowd.  For me,
the best film of 2014 to date, (though I admit I avoid the big budget CGI spectacles).  The film centers on a chef who, after being
panned by an obnoxious food critic at the posh restaurant he works, quits his job and heads to Miami with his estranged 10 year old son
and ex wife, and winds up buying an old food truck. fixes it up with the help of his son, and starts selling Cuban fast-food delights.  If
you enjoy father-son stories, and don't object to feel good films, you should really enjoy this.  It could have focused on the potential
conflicts between Dad and Ex or Son, or a policeman who made him move his truck, but instead stayed positive and fun.  Terrific!",1405036800,2,946,4.340909090909091
6444326,5,B00KQTGWPC,"First, the food porn: Oh my word! If you respond to food with primal glee as much as with esthetic delight, you'll come away with your mouth watering. Some of the preparation scenes in the first half of this flick truly rate as wild sensual excess. It might even take the place of erotic release in one memorable scene. Best, this treats all traditions with equal respect, from the fine culinary art of restaurant's master chef to the street performance style of a food truck. If it's done with skill, respect, and a bit of love, it's all good.

Then there's the family drama. A divorced dad tries, with miserable success, to make an emotional connection with his son. He flames out professionally and hits a personal (and incredibly well-publicized) low. But he rises from his own ashes, and work toward a suitably happy ending. Along the way, he does connect with his son and bonds more closely than he knew possible, all through the magic of food. I've actually seen that at work, a little. Kids seem desperate to find a place for themselves on the grownup world. A ten year old boy, as in this movie, can easily master cooking skills better than most adults', and use those skills to earn his place. Ignore the ""everybody's a star"" imitation of self-esteem from the feel-goodist movement. Making a meal that grownups truly enjoy gives self-esteem of the solid, hard-won kind.

I'm skipping lots, of course, in favor of the parts that I connected with most closely. But that makes this movie distinctive. As much as might enjoy the general run of cinema, in all the different ways a movie can be enjoyed, I rarely find the real, personal connection that I felt in this. Star power, and there's plenty in this movie, doesn't give that. Only the ineffable sense of heart does, and this movie has plenty. All of a sudden this one's near the top of my favorites.

6444327,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Written and directed by Jon Favreau, who also stars in the title role, Chef is an amazing, thoroughly engaging film about doing what you love and loving what you do.  To classify it as a small independent film feels completely at odds with the surprising number of top notch actors who show up in it and the superb craftsmanship it shows. It's more fitting to call it a labor of love that is also absolutely one of the best films to come out in 2014.

Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) is a Miami-born chef working in an up-scale restaurant in Los Angeles.  He's been there for a number of years and his food is a success, and he's well-liked by everyone, from the hostess Molly (Scarlett Johansson) to his assistants Tony (Bobby Canavale) and  Martin (John Leguizamo) and the rest of the kitchen staff.  But lately Carl's feeling like he's falling into a rut, serving the same fare over and over again simply because it's popular and keeps the customers coming in, which is all the owner, Riva (Dustin Hoffman) cares about.  However a chance to prove himself again when a prestigious critic and blogger, Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) announces that he's going dine at his restaurant. Apparently Michel once reviewed him some years earlier and pronounced him as being one of the most exciting new chefs on the scene. Wanting to once again make an impression and exercise his creative side, Carl comes up with a completely new menu, to be introduced the night when Michel is supposed to be there.  But Riva wants to play it safe and tells Carl to forget the new menu and serve the same old classics. When Carl protests, Riva shuts him down with a you-work-for-me serve-what-I-say-or-else and the old menu stands.  As a result, Michel gives the restaurant an unfavorable review on his blog, disparaging Carl personally for his disappointment. Carl, who is completely tech un-savvy and has to be shown how to read the blog, responds in what he thinks is an email, daring Michel to come again and try his completely new menu, not realizing that his response is going out to everyone following Michel's blog.  Michel accepts the challenge, which goes viral and the night of his visit the restaurant is packed.  But once again Riva shuts Carl down and insists on the same old menu being served.  Frustrated, Carl storms out, taking the makings of his new menu with him and then preparing the dishes at home.  When Michel arrives at the restaurant and ends up being served exactly the same menu he panned the last time around, he stares at the food in utter disbelief (Platt's expressions in this scene are priceless).  When Carl hears that Michel is in the restaurant, he comes back in a fury and begins yelling at the critic in the restaurant in front of all the other customers (half of whom end up recording his rant and posting it on Youtube where it goes viral).

Out of work, Carl finds himself not only unemployed but unemployable due to the viral video of his rant.  Carl's ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) invites him to come back to Miami for a while and he reluctantly returns there with her. But the return to his roots seems to help Carl relax and re-focus.  It also gives him a chance to re-connect with Percy (EmJay Anthony), his son with Inez. Gradually he begins to consider an idea Inez pushes on him, to start over and do a food truck where he can be his own boss and serve whatever he wants. Inez's other ex-husband Marvin (Robert Downey Jr. in a fun role) offers to set him up with a food truck, and Carl accepts.

Warming to the project, Carl sets about restoring  the broken-down food truck, first with help from Percy, who really wants nothing more than to spend time with his dad, and later from Martin who shows up out of the blue, having quit his job at the restaurant the moment he heard Carl was doing a food truck.  The newly restored food truck is christened El Jefe, and serves Cubanos, a form of Cuban sandwich.  After some initial try-outs in Miami, Carl decides to drive the food truck with Martin across the country, back to L.A., doing business all the way. With, as it turns out, Percy helping out as well after manipulating his dad into letting him come along.  Which turns out to be a very good thing as tech-savvy Percy finds ways to promote the food truck on social media websites, spreading advance word of El Jefe so that crowds wanting to try their Cubanos just materialize in whatever town they show up.

The cast is excellent with solid performances all around. Jon Favreau (The Wolf of Wall Street, the Iron Man movies) is perfect as Carl, showing the difference passion makes in someone's life.  John Leguizamo (Moulin Rouge, the Ice Age movies) gives fine supportive balance as Martin, the sous chef who decides to cast his lot with Carl precisely because Carl cares so much about what he does. Bobby Canavale (Blue Jasmine, Boardwalk Empire) provides a nice counterpoint as Tony, the assistant chef torn between being loyal to Carl and his shot at moving up to be the restaurant's top chef when Carl leaves. Scarlett Johansson (The Avengers, Lost in Translation) brings a nice bit of sweetness to Molly, the restaurant hostess who understands Carl's desire to serve something new. Veteran actor Dustin Hoffman (do you really not know who he is?) does a deft turn as Riva, the restaurant owner who demands that Carl stick to what's safe. And Oliver Platt (The Big C, Pieces of April) is perfect as blogger/critic Ramsay Michel whose devastating review serves as the spark that sends Carl out in a new direction, and who later brings things full circle once again in a nicely done plot turn near the end.

Sofia Vergara (Modern Family) is charmingly effective as Inez, the woman who clearly knows her ex-husband better than he knows himself.  EmJay Anthony (Rake) is superbly engaging as Percy, hitting exactly the tone needed as a kid who wants to be with his dad but who's also savvy about navigating the tricky seas between divorced parents. Real-life Afro-Cubano salsero Jose ""Perico"" Hernndez lends an authentic feel to the Miami scenes as Inez's musician father, Abuelito. Robert Downey Jr. clearly is having some fun as Marvin, Inez's first husband, who sincerely wants to be helpful but at the same time can't resist the opportunity to needle Inez's second ex-husband Carl a bit. And Amy Sedaris (Alpha House, Strangers with Candy) has some fun playing it straight as Jen, Carl's sympathetic publicist.

But what really makes Chef work is the enormous amount of heart it has, showing us what it means to be doing what you love and to love what you do.  Watching Carl come alive again, finding enthusiasm and drive for each new day and each new stop on the way, is pure joy.  As is watching him re-connect with Percy, reminding us that a lot of being a dad means simply spending time with your son, and that what you do isn't as important to a kid as is the fact that you share it with him.  The scenes where Carl buys Percy his first chef's knife, where Percy rebels at having to clean out a filthy grease trap, and where Carl takes the time to explain to Percy the importance of doing things the right way and why it matters, are some of the best in the film, as are the scenes where Percy in turn shows his dad just what can be accomplished with a grasp of how social media works.

And of course a lot of the film is devoted to food, its preparation and its enjoyment, and how for some people, like Carl, food is a passion, the thing that gives life meaning. On a side note, you might want to stay through the end-credits where they have clips of real-life food truck chef Roy Choi, who trained Favreau for his role, showing Favreau how the food preparation scenes should look to be authentic.

Seriously, do whatever it takes to see this movie.  It's worth every dollar and every minute, and it'll stay with you for a long time after you've watched it.

Highly, highly recommended.",1404000000,129,7922,4.607675906183369
6444328,5,B00KQTGWPC,"My taste buds have been tingling every since I watched that first scene in the restaurant kitchen; this one is a ""foodie's"" paradise! Mouth-watering food, dazzlingly expert preparation and irresistible presentation make it almost pornographic: I wanted the address of that restaurant! Of course when a witty food critic trashes the place, everything comes to a head (I won't tell you how it happens): our chef is fired by his father, who owns the place, so reluctantly he hits the road for Miami, where he ventures into his own business with a food truck.

Producer/writer/director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"") brings us:
  * Jon Favreau (""Identity Thief"") as Carl, the poor fellow we are rooting for. We want him to bond with his son, mend his fences with his ex, and find his way to success.
  * Emjay Anthony (""It's Complicated"") is Percy, a son who really misses his dad. He's a good kid, a hard worker and a willing apprentice chef. And does he ever know how to use Twitter!
  * Robert Downey Jr. (""The Avengers"") plays Marvin, who used to be married to our hero's ex wife. (Ya got that straight?) He's a little odd, but then again, he has a used food truck for sale, so...
  * John Leguizamo (""Ride Along"") is Martin, a guy who loves to work with Carl. He knows how to make Cubanos, and they are the perfect sandwich for a food truck! (They sure LOOK yummy!)
  * Scarlett Johansson (""Don Jon"") brings us Molly; she has her hands full as hostess at the restaurant when they have a full house and no chef!
  * Oliver Platt (""Lucky Them"") plays Ramsey Michel, the restaurant critic, a fellow who enjoys entertaining his readers with his acerbic wit, with absolutely no thought to the careers he ruins. I LOVE Carl's rant about how hard people work in restaurants.

This is a road movie, with father and son traveling from Miami to Los Angeles in the food truck. Dad has a lot to learn about social networking and the son has to learn how to use the grill.

The R-rating must be for some of the language, but I can assure you there is very little profanity, absolutely no vehicular mayhem, no sexual situations, no gunshots and no blowie uppie stuff...although there IS that little bit with the corn starch... These people are decent law-abiding folks who even get permits when they sell their sandwiches. This is just FUN!

6444330,5,B00KQTGWPC,"If you're looking for a happy, charming comedy full of delicious delights that require no sharp utensils for their consumption, look no further than Jon Favreau's ""Chef."" Favreau plays Carl Casper, a brilliant, driven chef whose family life fell apart because of his single-minded devotion to his art. Though a master of his craft, Carl is not master at the Los Angeles restaurant where he works; the owner (Dustin Hoffman) insists that Carl continue to make the dishes he created a decade ago, on pain of being fired. This leads to conflict with a snobbish restaurant critic (Oliver Platt) who accuses Carl of creative stagnation. Carl accidentally touches off a Twitter/YouTube war with the critic that leaves him professionally humiliated and out of a job. In a Hail Mary attempt to salvage his career, Carl flies back to his home town of Miami to start a food truck and drive cross-country with it. In the process, Carl also finds himself reconnecting with his ex-wife (Sofia Vergara) and small son (Emjay Anthony).

""Chef"" isn't deep or profound in any way, but it is a breezy, consistently pleasant film that goes by far too quickly. Just as much as the characters and the dialogue, you will remember the profusion of mouth-watering food Favreau presents--Cubano sandwiches in Miami, beignets in New Orleans, barbecue in Austin. The movie's back-to-your-roots theme has led some critics to opine that Carl's story is symbolic of Favreau's own: after directing blockbusters such as ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and the first two Iron Man movies, Favreau is returning to the low-budget, character-driven comedies such as ""Swingers"" that first made his name. Perhaps that is so; I only know that ""Chef"" is a wonderful movie. Besides the aforementioned actors, such wonderful performers at Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale are also on hand, adding richness and flavor to the mix. ""Chef"" is a must-see--and make sure you've scoped out a good restaurant to go to after seeing it!",1403222400,,2012,5.078549848942598
6444331,4,B00KQTGWPC,"""Chef"" (2014 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Carl Kasper (played by Jon Favreau), a celebrity chef at a place called Gauloises (yes, the French cigarettes!) that is owned by Riva (played by Dustin Hoffman). Carl has just gotten a terrible review from the city's most important food critic (played by Oliver Platt), and unknowingly Carl starts a flame war via Twitter. When Carl is forced by Riva to stick to the ol' menu, he quits/is fired and needs to figure out something else. In a parallel story, we see Carl interacting with his 10 yr. old son Percy (played by newcomer EmJay Anthony), who is unhappy about his parents' divorce and desperately needs Carl's attention. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a veritable tour-de-force from Favreau who stars, directs, co-writes and co-produced this movie. How refreshing is it to see him do this, light years away from ""corporate"" jobs like directing ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"". Second, it appears that Favreau must've called in some old favors, as there is an all-star cast in the movie, with appearances from also Robert Downey Jr., a delightful Sofia Vergara (as Carl's ex-wife) and Scarlett Johansson (as the hostess of Gauloises). But the best performance comes from the little boy EmJay Anthony, who will tug at your heart. Third, while I titled my review that this is a ""foodie comedy"", that is true in part, but it is much more than that. The attention shift in equal parts to the father-son relationship in the second half of the movie, and the misgivings that Carl has on his past behavior as a husband and a father. Last but certainly not least, music also plays a pivotal role in the movie, including lots of Cuban music from artists like Roberto Roena and Perico Hernandez, whose band we see perform in the movie on several occasions. There is also a surprise appearance from Gary Clark Jr. (the movie soundtrack is very much worth checking out).

Bottom line: ""Chef"" is one of the best movies I have seen this year. The movie feels like a breath of fresh air among all those mega-sized action hero blockbusters that keep coming at us seemingly every week. I saw ""Chef"" when it opened some weeks ago here at my art-house theater in Cincinnati. I am happy to say that the screening where I saw this at was nicely attended, so it could well be that this movie will find some success in the theaters. ""Chef"" is worth checking out, be it in theaters or on DVD-Blu-ray. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403049600,52,2589,4.687912087912088
6444332,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Indie films can really be magical - they can hit all the right emotional notes that illuminate the human spirit, or they can be cloying and pretentious. Jon Favreaus Chef managed to get a remarkable cast together despite a tiny, tiny budget and a director who, for the past few years at least, has been doing big-budget studio blockbuster superhero movies. Chef is a passion project, which Favreau had to do a lot to simply get made. And it feels that way from beginning to end.

Favreau plays celebrity chef (and Im using that term loosely) Carl Casper, whos divorced from his wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and has allowed himself to become a terrible father to his son at the expense of a career doing a job that he doesnt even like anymore. He has a feud with a snooty restaurant critic (Oliver Platt,) which leads him to say goodbye to his comfortable job and staff (John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman) and figure out how to fix his life.

This is mainly a character study, and Carl is sometimes an excruciating character - saying or doing the wrong thing at many times, and yet, this means that he is utterly human. He ultimately makes the right decisions in the end, like we all hope to in life.

However, some things in Chef don't work. Its mainly because the film has such a stellar supporting cast and many of them don't get the time of day in the movie. Sofia Vergara has very little comedic material to work with, and Dustin Hoffman and Scarlett Johansson are never seen again after the films first half.

This is mainly a movie about a broken family that slowly finds a way to grow back together. Like the best indie tragicomedies, its about something bigger than it initially seems. While some actors are tragically underused (Amy Sedaris in ONE scene,) Chef will make you laugh, perhaps tear up a bit, and will leave a big goofy smile on your face at the end.

6444333,5,B00KQTGWPC,"Yes - a ""Yogi-ism"" of a title of a Paul Simon song - but this is what the movie is about. We have some great food being cooked and some scenes that are about things other than food. love, or relationships, but the basic thrust of this film is about a father and son really getting to know each other and liking the result.

The boy only wants to hang with dad, but dad thinks he needs to do things with the boy to make him happy. A mother and ex who really is concerned for the boy, not herself, helps the relationship grow.

Through some contrived circumstances, the father and son are together on a trip through the south of America and with social media's blessings, come to realize they really like each other.

OK - the foodies have some food porn thrust at them - but the relationship between father and son drives this film.

The ending is predicable - but what is not is the friendship and trust that a former employee shows the chef as he helps him with the lessons needed to show the son how to cope in a real kitchen.

Being a former Chicagoan - I can only say I give it a full thumbs up!",1402704000,2,1099,4.140845070422535
6444334,3,B00KQTGWPC,"Well if Jon Favreau's Chef had the goal of enmeshing viewers in the sights, sounds and imagery of great cuisine that will have audiences leaving theaters hungry outstanding food than Chef is a complete success, but as a film the romantic dramedy falters as Chef leaves me full, but not fully satisfied with what I just ate.

Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) is stuck in a rout living a mediocre life. Casper is a head chef at an upscale restaurant in Los Angeles, has good friends he works with in Martin (John Leguizamo), Molly (Scarlett Johansson), and Tony (Bobby Cannavale), but life is not as good as Carl makes it out to be. Casper is divorced from the beautiful Inez (Sofa Vergara) with whom he has a son with in Percy (EmJay Anthony) who Carl neglects, and lets down constantly, but Casper's personal life isn't the only part of his life that suffers as his work as a Chef suffers as well as the now famous chef is stuck in a rout not able to cook the food he wants or take a chance with his dish choices, and that all changes when a famous blogger and restaurant critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) comes to Casper's restaurant, and culminates after Ramsey gives Casper a bad review that leads to a major incident that goes viral to millions of people costing Carl Casper his job and lively hood leading the once great chef on a journey to his roots and discovery as he bonds with Percy, and reconnects with Inez.

Chef at times does a wonderful job using technology to display how quickly something and go viral destroying someone's career and life as well as showing how it can be used in just in nearly the same about of time can make someone famous, and like Carl I really don't understand twitter, one second videos or the likes of them or have used them so I felt for Carl. At times the use of twitter and other media outlets is charming and fun, but Chef overuses them turning something that was charming into something that was somewhat irritating. What drew me to Chef the first romantic dramedy I have seen in theaters since Silver Linings Playbook was the good cast that included Leguizamo, Vergara, Favreau, Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, and Robert Downey, Jr. Sadly much of the great cast was wasted on bit parts that didn't add any humor or anything to the film. The biggest standout was Downey Jr. who played Inez's other ex-husband Marvin who had one poorly written scene that seems have been only included to move the plot forward. The bombshell Johansson to was wasted. Though she did have more of a role, Scarlett's Molly seems to only to have been included to tell the audience in the early parts of the film what a masterful Chef Carl Casper was.

What saved Chef from mediocrity or being a bad film was Jon Favreau, John Leguizamo, and EmJay Anthony as Carl, Martin, and Percy. The three actors had great chemistry working together, and the relationship between Carl and Percy is what saved the film. Carl and Percy grow together throughout the film and on their journey on the food truck traveling from Miami to Los Angeles. Through the love of food and cooking Carl and Percy reach a new point in their relationship. John Leguizamo was his usual charming and funny self-bringing as Carl's best friend, and what aids these three actors is some wonderful and infectious soundtrack.

Chef suffers from having around a hours' worth of plot in a nearly two hour film with a slow build up, overuse of social media as a plot device, and wasted actors that is only saved by the charm and chemistry of Favreau, Leguizamo, and Anthony along with some excellent food, and a beautifully put together soundtrack. Ultimately my recommendation would be to skip Chef in the theater, and wait for it to be released on DVD or at Redbox.",1402444800,3,3741,4.595808383233533
6444335,4,B00KQTGWPC,"Chef is a straightforward story, which is told in an engaging and appealing way.

The star- Jon Favreau- also wrote and directed the movie. His character- a celebrity chef who falls from grace, then rebuilds his life- is appealing, sympathetic, believable, and most importantly: genuinely funny.

The story comprises several themes:

1. Confrontation between the artistic creative chef (Jon Favreau) and his conservative employer about whether to serve adventurous or conservative cuisine
2. A verbal ""pie fight"" between the chef and a fussy food critic
3. A father disconnected from his son
4. A road trip, where the chef rediscovers his creative roots and reconnects with his son
5. The chef discovers reinvigorated creativity

From these ingredients, Mr Favreau cooks up an entertaining feel good light comedy.

There are good cameo appearances from Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr.

Sofia Vergara appeals as the chef's ex wife.

While the story is simple and straightforward, it is told in an engaging and charming fashion, with a good dose of light humor.

The food scenes are gorgeous: apparently Mr Favreau did his own cooking after training from road truck chef Roy Choi - watch the closing credits!

Also, look out for the animated Twitter tweets- an interesting story telling technique.

This is an entertaining movie with broad appeal- well worth a look!

That may sound like a vanity project, but what an incredible passionate vanity project this was.

The story is more or less about this incredible Chef who cooks and runs a kitchen at a posh restaurant, but he butts heads with the owner on occasion played by Dustin Hoffman.  Because this Chef wants to cook what he wants, but that's not how it works in the restaurant business.  His ex-wife played by Sofia Vergara talks him into buying a taco food truck, which might sound doubtful, but turns into a real rags to riches kind of story.
