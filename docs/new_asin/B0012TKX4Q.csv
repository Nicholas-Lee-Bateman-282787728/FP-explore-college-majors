8247754,3,B0012TKX4Q,"My kids are excited to use this video all the time, and its a great introduction for them to yoga.  We all line up our mats and follow along.  Some of it is a little fast for my 3 and 5 year old but they're getting the hang of it.  She is engaging and fun for the kids.",1323302400,,269,3.603448275862069
