8733375,5,B015EXJ3H8,"A thrill ride of a horror movie with a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor. Great mix of demons and zombies, and the fight scenes between the Demon Hunters and the various baddies are very well done. You may never want to wait at a bus stop or a commuter parking lot again though!",1442448000,,279,4.283018867924528
