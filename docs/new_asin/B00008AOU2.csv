1833954,4,B00008AOU2,"A very good movie. One of the better films David Hewlett has starred in, right up there with Cube. Definitely worth the price. An intriguing look at the good and bad side of society and human nature. David does an excellent job playing Murray, the advertising executive with dirty little secrets and a dysfunctional family life, forced to take refuge up a tree in a city park when he strikes a gang member intending to rob him.  I don't know any of the other actors, but they did an equally great job portraying the vicious gang hell bent on getting Murray (David) down. If you're a fan of David's work, I'd definitely get it.",1110585600,9,626,4.491228070175438
1833955,3,B00008AOU2,"A WEALTHY WHITE MAN WALKS ONTO A GANG'S TURF. WHEN HE PREVENTS ONE OF THE GANG MEMBERS FROM ROBBING HIM, THE WHOLE GANG TRYS TO GET VENGEANCE ON HIM. TRAPPED IN THE WOODS, HE MUST FIGHT TO ESCAPE THE GANG. THE REAL SUPRISING THING IS THAT MUCH OF THE GANG IS ACTUALLY WHITE. THERE'S ONLY TWO BLACK MEMBERS. ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT MOVES AT A CONSIDERABLY SLOW PACE. THOUGH THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE A GANGSTA MOVIE, IT'S FAR FROM BEING ONE. IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GANGSTA MOVIE THAT HAS A LOT OF SHOOTING AND KILLING, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MOVIE YOU WANNA RENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS A SIMPLISTIC PLOT, THEN I'D SUGGEST YOU GET TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEOSTORE AND RENT THIS.",1067904000,3,756,4.368794326241135
1833956,5,B00008AOU2,"When it first started I thought it was gonna be totally different. I thought that the white guy would be caught in the middle of two gangs and see if he survives. Turns out he gets stuck, they hide from the gang, and they live. With all the anticipation to see whether or not cle' bennet and his gang get the man out of the tree is a cliff hanger. But in the end is a twist. You'll have to watch it to find out. Overrall performance, I'd say the loyalty, and then betrayal of words can separate many people...It's the truth everyone is looking for. What's ur truth?",1059609600,2,565,4.192660550458716

7981239,5,B00008AOU2,"This was a reaaly well thought out movie. The acting was great and the story line was excellent. Just like real life, don't judge a book by its cover. Or in the case of this movie, things are not always black and white, there is a lot of gray in life, that Murray and a band of street punks learn over an evening of trying 0to one up each other. I've seen quite a few reviews that have said, if you're a Hewlet fan that this is a must see. I say, if you're a fan of GOOD psychology drama then this is a must see. Buy and enjoy!",1358467200,,527,3.8440366972477062
7981240,4,B00008AOU2,"I bought this movie knowing almost nothing about it, except that it starred David Hewlett, who I love from the Stargate Atlantis series.

It does not disappoint; the style of the movie is indie cinema (the simple direction and sets kind, not the ""what the heck was that movie about"" kind.) The script feels as though it would have fared equally well on a stage, it is small, intimate, and the focus is on the human interactions, not car chases or large explosions (don't get me wrong, love those too, but that's not what this is about.)

David Hewlett is polished and perfect in the role from start to finish. At first, the performance of the other actors seems a bit forced, but they quickly relax into their characters and open up and you will find yourself consumed by this world, with no idea of what's going to happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed this story about assumptions, preconceptions and the very human tendency to slot other people into ""us"" and ""them"" categories until the complexity of real interaction shows the depth to the people behind the stereotypes -- often better and worse human beings than we'd imagined.

This movie really stuck with me afterwards, making me wish there were more to the story, to know what the characters did with the rest of their lives, especially Murray, but the ending is somehow appropriate -- it leaves you wanting more but is also fitting and satisfying in its own way.",1358208000,,1418,4.686746987951807
7981241,5,B00008AOU2,I think this movie was awesome. David Hewlett was really fantastic and you really feel sorry for him. The kids that played the gang were also very good. I recommend this movie to any David Hewlett fan.,1244851200,,201,4.45945945945946
7981242,5,B00008AOU2,Not what you expect from a gangster style movie-David Hewlett was superb kept you interested and guessing on what will happen next.,1239753600,,131,5.0
7981243,5,B00008AOU2,"Originally I only bought this movie because of David Hewlett. I have seen a few of his movies and love him in Stargate Atlantis, so I decided to see some of his other movies. As always, I am impressed by David's wonderful acting. Combined with the plot of the movie, this was a wonderfully enjoyable movie.

Get Down (or Treed Murray) is a movie that really brings into the light what people will do for themselves, but also what they will do for others. It's the best and it's the worst. This movie was gripping and I really had no idea what would happen at the end. I do not regret buying this movie. Even if I had only rented, I would have bought it anyway. For David Hewlett fans I highly recommend this movie. For anyone who is just interested in the odd title (either one) I say the same. This movie caught me by surprise. I assure you that it will do the same for any future viewers.",1233187200,,890,4.235294117647059
7981244,5,B00008AOU2,"Appropriately titled, ""Get Down"", because that is literally what the main character's assailants want him to do and what he is desperately trying his best not to do, once he lands up in a tree after defending himself in a botched robbery.  While they're waiting each other out, there are moments when each character's own inner turmoils comes to light.  I thought it was quite a different approach and a very interesting concept for a movie.",1191715200,,441,4.7894736842105265
7981245,5,B00008AOU2,The best movie of 2001 by far. A little known Canadian jewel that will leave an impact on you long after the cathode flicker has faded. Superbly layer and texturing psychological thriller which pits a gang of urban thug against a tree-bound wing-tipped marketing executive. It become of war of endurance as wit and psychology pit against each other in a battle of the Minds.,1146960000,4,374,4.769230769230769
7981246,5,B00008AOU2,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Love David Hewlett in SGA and really found his performance in this movie to be fantastic! Really would recommend this movie to all David Hewlett fans!,1140566400,10,181,5.066666666666666
