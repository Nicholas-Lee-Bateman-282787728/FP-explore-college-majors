6697621,4,B00O0MBPOO,"I am not going into much detail because the first reviewer said it all. What I found in this DVD were short and long video clips edited together to form a sort of documentary. It has no beginning, no end, no story line, just clips in a time and place of the Doors. I love the Doors so I enjoyed the film. The video quality was clean and clear as well as the audio. I just wish there would have been something from Jim that would have shown us that his brain wasn't completely fried. Could the man actually hold an intelligent conversation? I don't know. It was more a case of ""earth to Jim"". Hello? What he did manage to say made as much sense as pig fart. The man was way out there. Too bad because he had a genius I.Q.. He was obviously a man with demons that he self medicated with drugs and alcohol. A waste of a fine talent.",1415923200,4,829,4.060975609756097
6697622,3,B00O0MBPOO,"OK. Strap yourselves in. This will not be pretty. From one fanatical Doors fan to another this Dvd/BluRay marketed as a ""Doors documentary"" BY THE DOORS is a joke.
Part 1: This so called documentary is less than 40 minutes long & is 80% musical performances we have seen over & over again on past DVD's or bootlegs with a hint of  Road footage shot with no audio with studio Doors songs playing over them & some chaotic footage of Doors live performances (again with studio versions of songs NOT live). Very unimpressive & not what I expected.
Part 2: The Doors documentary Encore (about 32 minutes)....The freakin' Encore is much more impressive & has WAYYYY more backstage footage of Jim & the band, footage of the band wandering around certain cities on tour, indirect interviews with Jim, footage of the insanity that took place at Doors concerts with LOTS of police presence etc. Much more impressive and informative than the documentary"". It really should have been one long piece & not broken up into 2 separate sections.
Part 3: The Doors Are Open - a 1968 European Doors performance dvd that I have had since 2002. Is the quality wayyy better? Absolutely. Is it something a hardcore Doors fan has not seen before. NO. End of story.
Part 4: The End, Live in Toronto. AGAIN, any Doors fan will have seen this performance before and although it is credited as one of the best live performances by the Doors EVER"" I would say the version of The End from Part 1 is far superior as Jim improv's his way thru the performance making for an epic 17 minute breath taking performance. Overall, it's a bunch of stuff us hardcore fans have already seen. But 20% of this DVD/BluRay will shed SOME light on the Jim that existed outside of the ""Oliver Stone"" version of Jim. Which, let's face it, was just as real as the calm, poetic, loving Jim.",1415836800,17,1839,4.572727272727272
6697623,4,B00O0MBPOO,"""...it was an amazing film, deeply subjective, pure point of view, continually moving through life/space with everything moving around and past you."" Sheldon Renan, talking about The Doors ""Feast of Friends""

""We've pilfered from it in the past. Lets see the whole damn thing as it was intended.""  John Densmore

These opinions run the gamut of opinion on The Doors ""Feast of Friends"" and both are absolutely valid critiques. Although a video of the film has been available in bootleg form for years this marks the 'official' release of the film

In the spring of 1968 The Doors were the biggest band in America hot on the heels of the success of ""Light My Fire"" and ""Hello, I Love You"" about to recreate that feat. Paul Ferrara, who was working as a photographer of the band, as well as a UCLA film school friend of Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, noticing the rising star and power of his friends suggested they make a documentary of the spring/summer tour before the European tour. Ferrara was enlisted to photograph and design the film, he brought on friend Babe Hill as a sound man, and for a brief period an underemployed actor named Harrison Ford as gofer and cameraman.

Throughout the summer of 1968 the ""Feast of Friends"" crew captured The Doors at the height of their artistic powers including the Hollywood Bowl show (of which ""The End"" is included ""Feast of Friends""), some of The Doors controversial moments such as the Singer Bowl riot, and the band backstage relaxing before a show with a practice piano as Jim improvises his ""Ode to Friedrich Nietzsche"", or the somewhat mysterious post-show encounter with Fred L. Stagmeyer, Minister at large. The project had a long gestation period with it being edited and reedited by Frank Lisciandro, until due to financial constraints from ""The Miami Incident"" The Doors pulled the plug on the project until Ferrara and Lisciandro prevailed upon Morrison for money to add credits and clean up the film enough for presentation.

After it's completion the film wasn't widely shown, but it did make a few film festivals (The Atlanta International Film Festival), the Jim Morrison film festival and those trusted by Jim Morrison where it received awards and laudatory reviews.

If you haven't seen ""Feast of Friends"" before you may recognize a lot of scenes from Doors produced videos from the 80's which cannibalized much of the main scenes from ""Feast"" for MTV and other video outlets of the day. That shouldn't detract or dissuade people from seeing ""Feast of Friends"" in it's pristine form, as it was meant to be seen by an audience.

Some what mystifying is the inclusion of ""The Doors Are Open"" and the Toronto 1967 version ""The End"" from the TV show ""The Rock Scene: As It Is"" in the bonus features. Both have been on DVD before. ""The Doors Are Open"" was a bonus feature on the DVD of Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" and ""The Rock Scene"" clip was on ""The Soft Parade"" section of ""The Soundstage Performances"" and the interviews with Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, Robby Krieger and Danny Sugerman are imported whole cloth from that release. What is of interest is ""Feast of Friends: Encore"" which is basically extended scenes or outtakes of what didn't make it into the actual film. The `Encore' section may give you some insight into the band and Jim Morrison more than film because those are the unguarded moments which can reveal our self. Jim Morrison approaching some fans outside after a show is one of those moments. The credits for `Feast of Friends: Encore"" finally acknowledges and includes and credits bassist Doug Lubahn for working with The Doors.

With the release of ""Feast of Friends"" for the first time fans can experience what a theatrical release of the film would have been like. Now Doors fans can get rid of their old grainy 75th generation bootleg of ""Feast,"" more casual fans can get a high quality official release, and the rest of the rock world may see the excitement and danger in the performances that fans have long seen.

6697625,5,B00O0MBPOO,"After decades of buying really bad bootleg copies of The Doors Feast Of Friends film, The Doors themselves are releasing Feast Of Friends completely restored from the original 16mm negative on both Blu-ray and dvd. The film has been color-corrected and mastered in high definition with the original soundtrack remixed and remastered by long time Doors producer/engineer Bruce Botnick. The film was originally shot in 16mm Black and White film, then quickly switched to 16mm Color film by long time Doors friend and Director of Cinematography cameraman Paul Ferrara. The original sound recording was recorded on location live using a portable Nagra reel to reel recorder by Babe Hill- a long time close friend of Jim Morrison. The film was then edited by long time Doors friend Frank Lisciandro. Frank edited over 20 hours of film taken from concerts, recording studios, limos, planes, monorails, backstage dressing rooms and even private moments. The 20 hours of film was edited into this 40 minute documentary. (The bootleg copies I have are all different lengths of time that range from 40 minutes to 1 hour, but the official length of this film is 40 minutes). Frank edited this film on the lower floor of The Doors office in a tiny room in the back that was used for storage. It was common for Jim Morrison to stop into the tiny room and show Frank what he wanted to see in the documentary and what songs would be best to use. After viewing this Doors film on many different bootleg copies from many different countries over the years in it's horrible grainy, blurry faded condition, it will be fantastic to see the film on Blu-ray totally restored in high definition.

Feast Of Friends is a documentary The Doors themselves wanted to make about themselves on the road during their Summer Tour in 1968. It is the first and only film produced by The Doors about The Doors. In March of 1968, The Doors decided to begin filming at their concerts- getting footage both from the concerts and behind the scenes. With Paul Ferrara behind his 16mm camera, Babe Hill with his portable Nagra reel to reel recorder and Frank Lisciandro both helping filming with his 16mm camera and editing, The Doors began filming. The following concerts from the Summer of 1968 were filmed for this Doors Documentary, Feast Of Friends:

APRIL 19,1968- Westbury Music Fair, Westbury, New York

AUGUST 31,1968- Asbury Park Convention Hall, Asbury Park, New Jersey
SEPTEMBER 1,1968- Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, New York- THE END OF FILMING FEAST OF FRIENDS (The Doors would go on to their European Tour, yet continue to film sometimes to hope to make the film more complete, which was never done)

Even though there is no telling exactly where The Doors actually are in this film, some places are recognizable- like The Hollywood Bowl or where you see signs of places or highway signs. I listed these concert's cities for anyone who was at any of these Doors concerts, so they can enjoy memories of any of these places, should they have been used in the film. I was too young at age 14 (my parents wouldn't let me go to concerts until I was 16) to go to the Cleveland Public Auditorium on August 3, 1968 to see The Doors, but my husband and older friends went- and we only see Cleveland in this film as Five To One is playing in the foreground. Perhaps we don't hear the actual sound because Jim Morrison was really loaded and yelling at the audience, instead of singing. This caused the worst riot at the Cleveland Auditorium- everything was destroyed- including these huge heavy doors that were actually ripped off their hinges. I'm certain none of Jim's slurred singing, yelling, throwing himself in the audience with the crowds yelling over the music and the crowd's rioting was used in the foreground of the audio, as it was complete loud chaos. The most famous picture of Jim Morrison at the Cleveland Public Auditorium was at the end, where Jim Morrison makes a face and throws a punch at the camera. The film of the Cleveland Auditorium was of complete chaos and rioting and the only way we knew this was Cleveland, was because we recognized the distinct Cleveland Auditorium's wide low arched ceiling with beautiful windows. Feast Of Friends was shown at a few film festivals in 1968, but an official release would never be seen until now. The film, supervised by Jim Morrison was never completed, making what film there is from 1968 all the more rare. Filmed are both on stage performances and off stage moments of The Doors, including their great songs. Over the years, Doors fans have seen snips of the film here and there on different Doors dvd's, but never the entire film (except on bootleg) up until now.

Feast Of Friends opens with Strange Days playing as groupies chase after The Doors being driven in a limo going to Westbury, New York. The girls all try to touch Jim Morrison, as a policeman tells Jim to wait to get out of the vehicle so he won't get mobbed. At an outdoor concert, you'll hear Wild Child playing as the California Hells Angels are filming The Doors at Santa Clara County Fairgrounds in California. If you notice a young man loading his 8mm camera at Santa Clara, look close, as this is film student turned actor Harrison Ford. Harrison was hired by The Doors to help with the filming. There are many of The Doors songs heard throughout the film- such as Moonlight Drive (playing with film shots of San Diego, Dallas and Santa Barbara), Five To One (begins in Philadelphia, changes to rioting in Cleveland), Not To Touch The Earth (the Singer Bowl and other locations) and The End (the Hollywood Bowl), as you see them riding a monorail (in Seattle), performing onstage, flying in an airplane (in Hawaii), sailing in a sail boat (in Hawaii) and more.

The personal moments show The Doors behind the scenes, traveling, just playing around and even vacationing together. You'll hear Jim Morrison talking with a minister (in Bakersfield), conversing with a girl backstage who got injured at the concert (at the Singer Bowl in NY), reciting in a plane (in Hawaii) and even playing the piano to his own words (in Saratoga Springs, NY). Ray also plays the piano and Robbie is playing his guitar just for their own amusement. Especially touching is the lovely music at the end (in Hawaii) while the Doors are sailing on the sailboat with nothing but the beautiful open sky, water and their friends onboard. The beautiful music playing is titled Neptune, The Mystic from the album The Planets Suite by British composer Gustav Holst (1874-1934).

There are also 3 Bonus Features included:
1.) FEAST OF FRIENDS: ENCORE- This is a complimentary piece using rare Doors recordings and some great unreleased footage. It opens with Peace Frog playing as Ray, Robby and Jim are playing poker. You'll also see the elusive Pamela Courson driving Jim in a car as Peace Frog is playing. Jim also recites in a backstage dressing room and as Summer's Almost Gone plays, there is a really nice homage paid to Jim on film and again a glimpse of Jim's girlfriend Pamela Courson behind some green bushes/trees- look for her red hair. Shown is more of the conversation between Jim and the minister in Bakersfield, California and as Wishful Sinful plays, we get to see more of The Doors at the Space Needle in Seattle. The Doors walk into Richard Avedon's studio, but are immediately told to leave as no cameras are allowed, due to Avedon's fantastic photos, which are not allowed to be photographed or copied. Runnin Blue plays as we see more film of The Doors in Hawaii and we get to see more studio moments of The Doors, Paul Rothchild and Bruce Botnick as they record Wild Child.
2.) THE DOORS ARE OPEN- Previously released British TV documentary which originally aired on December 17, 1968 just after Feast Of Friends was filmed. The film focuses on the band's performance at London's Roundhouse. Bruce Botnick has transformed the sound to be as close to the original live sound as possible, and the image quality has been dramatically improved as well.
3.) THE END- This performance of The End is considered to be one the best performances of The Doors ever caught on film. This was filmed in Toronto, Canada in August 1967 and broadcast in October of 1967 for The O'Keefe Centre Presents: The Rock Scene- Like It Is. In addition to the performance, this includes the introduction by Noel Harrison and later interviews by John Densmore, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and Danny Sugerman.

After waiting literally decades for The Doors Feast Of Friends to be made into a good copy on dvd, I am beyond happy to finally be able to have a Blu-ray remastered, restored from the original negative and color corrected with the original soundtrack also remixed and remastered. The sharp picture and amazing sound on the Blu-ray is just wonderful. To finally own the official Doors release of their film Feast Of Friends is definitely worth 5 STARS and the fantastic Bonus Feast Of Friends Encore with the never been seen before footage is worth the price of this Blu-ray alone. A Million Thanks To the surviving Doors- Robby and John who made this film finally possible, to Bruce Botnick for the GREAT sound and especially of the pristine sounding songs, and everyone at Eagle Rock. Going back to 1968 with The Doors is a fabulous gift for all The Doors and Jim Morrison fans, and with this release, I am keeping my fingers crossed for a Jim Morrison's Highway release in the future- that would be the icing on the cake.",1412380800,104,10641,4.9286510590858414
6697626,5,B00O0MBPOO,Very interesting documentary following the Doors on their 1968 tour. The main feature is live and back stage footage with some great extras. The sound and picture quality is simply amazing for and old film like this. If you have a good sound set up you will notice how much care and time were put into this film. If you are a Doors fan you must own this,1487116800,,353,4.205882352941177
6697627,4,B00O0MBPOO,"While the ""official"" film is short and overly familiar, it's understandable that they kept it intact as the original edit. The newer ""encore"" edit is the better of the two, with unfamiliar bits and a much better representation of the Doors and their era. The ""rare"" music is a stream of consciousness piano piece by Jim. and Robbie goofing around with blues, played acoustically on an electric guitar. Otherwise, it's just songs that weren't the ""hits"". It's actually fairly fascinating.

The cleaned up presentation of ""The Doors Are Open"" is very welcome, as is the Toronto version of The End.",1487030400,,595,4.95

The film itself is nothing a fan hasn't seen in poor boots and grainy older releases. But restored in Blu ray first time makes it seem made yesterday.  The sound playback on my surround sound system is excellent.  Regarding the Encore footage.... It got personal for me seeing Jim & the band exploring The Seattle center!  Riding the monorail, taking the elevator up the Space Needle, and exploring the observation deck.  But the most awesome part being even captured is the band and recording studio interacting and rehearsing, and finally laying down the track for ""Wild Child""!  Watching them critique and fine tune the song was a gem!  Footage of the boys off stage was all too brief, but showed they genuinely got along with each other. I'm so happy it has Close captioning as much of the dialogue is hard to hear clearly.  The Doors Are Open had owned on a previously released dvd, but was cleaned up for BD.

I'm a big Doors fan and enjoyed this BluRay but I will say a lot of this footage has been included on other Doors videos over the years including Jim playing piano.

From what I can tell the only live stuff I don't have already have are just more versions of Light My Fire and Break on Through. I have no interest watching lipsynching and most of the backstage footage on Charlie is My Darling bored the crap out of me so I'm assuming this is more of the same crap except its Jim instead of Mick. Roadhouse Blues at Wight seems cool but I'm betting they'll release the whole gig some day.
(Oh, I also have some crappy Allan Douglas produced DVD that has both the Doors Are Open and the Stones in the Park Granada specials but they're each missing two songs. Allan Douglas didn't just screw up Hendrix stuff I guess)",1423699200,,854,4.516129032258065

6697687,5,B00O0MBPOO,As a Long time Doors fan I thought I'd heard it all but feast of friends sheds a whole new light upon Jim Morrison. Interviews with the people who were Jim's friends was fascinating as well as sad to read. From the interviews you gain insights into a very complex but at the same time vulnerable man. A man who cared more about the art and creativity than the fame and fortune. In the end the rock star persona that had been created. Consumed Jim Morrison. It's hard to say why some stars are able to somehow separate the star persona from the normal person that they are and others become consumed by it. And why those closest to it fail to see what's happening or see it and do nothing to stop it. Overall a good book if you are a fan of the Doors.,1420675200,,750,4.1438356164383565

There are some new scenes and they are worth watching and having this Blu-ray for those scenes I guess. It is all sales marketing  of whatever footage they have left of the Doors , dragging out new clips on each new Doors DVD that comes out. Basically this is for us fans who are in our 50s or 60s in age or new younger fans of the Doors if they even care or exist . I do not know of any young people into old classic rock personally, it was our generation , Just like I do not care for todays music at all which in my opinion is lame to say the least. I am glad I was young in the 1970s and the  music of the 1960s and 1970s, the music was great the cars were great  and just a better time in America way better than today for sure. This  DVD brings back those better days to enjoy again , even if it has  some previous footage .

6697709,5,B00O0MBPOO,"I'm rather shocked by some of the negative things that have been said by other reviewers that call themselves Doors fans. First, it must be said that this release is for the dedicated Doors fan, not the casual classic rock fan. We've been begging for a proper release of this film for decades, now that that they have released it (in HD no less) you guys are going to complain? This is the kind of bickering that's keeping HWY from ever being released.

Feast of Friends:
It was never any secret that the original cut of ""Feast of Friends"" was rough. The truth is that the film was never finished. Once the Miami incident hit, the focus went towards Jim's trial and finding the Doors a venue that would accept them. With this said, Feast of Friends was never polished. I agree, it could've been better, but I'm glad that it was released exactly as Jim saw it. But if any of you are the ""fanatic Doors"" fans you claim to be, you would've seen this movie already and knew exactly what you were getting into when you bought this blu-ray. Kudos to Eagle Rock for not touching a single frame. Doors fans should be grateful to have this footage in HD, rather than complain that ""it didn't flow"". For me, the film was never about a cinematic piece of art (I don't think its fair to judge it as such since it was never completed), but rather about seeing the Doors at their wildest moments. And the claims that this is rehashed stuff is a boldface lie. A huge chunk of the film was never officially released - some segments were, but never in their entirety. Also, the claim that ""The End"" Hollywood Bowl segment is the same as whats on the Hollywood Bowl '68 blu-ray is untrue. Its a different cut of the performance, exactly as they cut it in 69. Maybe not  by much, but it is. What Eagle Rock did was give a beautiful HD print of a Doors film project in progress, and for this I'm very grateful.

Feast of Friends Encore:
For me, this was the most fascinating. Nearly all of the footage in this half hour segment has never been seen before, ever. The only moment I can think of off the top of my head that has been seen before was the card game. Otherwise, nearly all of this stuff was new to me, so it absolutely blew me away to see Jim just being Jim. I get the feeling this is the last of the footage in the Doors archive that is worth sharing. Again, it bothers me tremendously that people are saying this blu-ray is rehashed stuff when nearly all of Encore has never been seen before.

The Doors are Open and the End Performance:
These two extras have been seen before. ""The Doors are Open"" probably looks the best its ever going to look. A lot of restoration had went into it, pulling out a lot of detail. The End performance from a Canadian broadcast is a great color performance, but for some reason didn't look so vibrant.

Features:
I do wish that perhaps there was a commentary track or interviews, with at least Frank Lisciandro who originally cut the original Feast of Friends. I really don't think that would've been too much trouble. The guy does interviews all the time.

Overrall, it was a blessing as a Doors fan to finally get a proper release of this film. The Encore piece was an added treat, but this probably finishes up all of the Doors material. I can't imagine what else they could release other than HWY, which is a Jim Morrison property, and not the Doors. The Morrison family wants to release it, the Coursons do not. They think because it looks so shotty, that it will reflect poorly on Jim's body of work.

Big thanks to Eagle Rock for releasing all this great Doors stuff in great quality. For a true Doors fanatic, its a dream come true.",1416960000,6,3665,4.372980910425844
6697710,5,B00O0MBPOO,Excellent and finally available. Sound is excellent. The video is pristine sharp and clear. You have never seen the Doors like this or the 60's like this. It is so clean its bizarre. From another time or another world. The bonus Feast of Friends: Encore is as mesmerizing. Thank-you Doors for releasing this. I am very pleased by the results.,1416441600,3,342,4.716666666666667
6697711,5,B00O0MBPOO,Well done!,1416441600,2,10,4.5
6697712,5,B00O0MBPOO,"Like other reviewers, I have been waiting to see this footage for a long time.  Also like others, I have other programs/docs which contain some of it.

First of all, the SOUND is so great.  No more pops and clicks.  Especially in the Granada TV show, the sound is amazing.  I have seen this in varying incarnations since the first time I saw it on Night Flight (remember that?), but now it has been restored visually and aurally.

I attended the Doors' Houston, TX show in 1968 and was thrilled to see 3 clips from that show in Feast, especially the one in which HPD was hauling Morrison off the stage.  Alas, that was the only time they played in Houston.  The next concert scheduled was subsequently cancelled after Florida.

What I appreciated most of all were the live clips - from the Granada show and the Toronto show.  I have NEVER stopped listening to The Doors.  However, there is a big difference between live performance and studio work.  Especially in these days of autotune and otherwise enhanced music, true musicianship is even more appreciated.  The Doors were phenomenal musicians!  I was just thrilled to hear again how great they sounded live.  When introducing the Toronto clip at the end, all 3 then-remaining Doors had something to offer about it.  After grudgingly watching the clip, even John Densmore seemed to be reminded as well, exclaiming how great they sounded.

Since Jim's death, it must be almost impossible for new fans of The Doors to see beyond the Morrison hot/sexy/dead mystique.  For those of us around and tuned in then, The Doors were a great band.  In many documentaries which have come out since the early 1980's, the focus has been exclusively on Jim.  However, The Doors as a unit produced some of the most remarkably innovative music and lyrics at a time of tidal waves of innovative music and lyrics.  Feast of Friends shows the Doors as a band better than any of the many other docs I have.  This friend is going to enjoy the feast for a very long time.",1416096000,37,2001,4.625
6697713,4,B00O0MBPOO,"I usually Start with '5-Stars' - then Detract from there. - As I did in this case. I feel like starting with my complaints - so here we go. - -
I am a True Diehard doors fan - with a Massive collection! This is now 2014 - Why does it take 46 YEARS to get around to releasing these things!! I knew a fan - who years ago said - he hoped ""we'd see such things Before We Die!"" - And now he's dead.
The menu on this Stinks - I can barely read it. This Bluray case couldn't be cheaper.
And although Robbie & John are still alive - there is NO audio commentary option. : (
This Does include 'The doors are open' - and even Better - 'Feast of Friends Encore' - and I have NEVER seen this before.
There are more goodies they Could release - but - the best I can guess - is they're building up suspense - for their target clientele - when we're all in Heaven - and they (the doors) are going after the 'Eternity Market'.

6697714,1,B00O0MBPOO,"I am a huge doors fan but I was very disappointed in this newest Doors release. The editing and flow stinks and looks like it was put together by an amateur. The film could have been salvageable if the main film and the encore were edited into one longer film and skipping the rehashed performance of The End from ""Live at the Bowl '68"" then maybe they would have had something to offer the fans. It would have been an easy fix but they absolutely dropped the ball. Save your time and money and don't buy it.
