8646380,1,B00IYJTIP2,"I made the mistake of ordering this based on the title. I remember coming home from school as a kid and watching a show called Fred Flintstone and Friends. It featured teenage Pebbles and Bam Bam, Jeannie and The Partridges In Space. This dvd is not that show. What it is in reality is the first 7 episodes of the original 1960's series. I accept my part in this mistake as I should have researched farther. Still part of me can't help but wonder if this title was not selected to intentionally mislead the consumer. The episodes themselves are of course classic but are not new to dvd.",1399334400,19,586,4.435185185185185
