7807706,1,6300261832,"Ali MacGraw returns to England and the family horse farm run by her older sister after blowing her inheritance while living for two years in America.  Shortly after a young woman is murdered brutally in the woods and then another.  The police are baffled.  MacGraw's character wants to sell the horse farm for 400,000.00 and split the money but her older sister refuses.  But when the older sister dies the younger sister inherits everything and then she can do anything she wants with the farm.

I'm sure you can tell exactly where this is headed based on my description--but despite the fact that it's obvious early where the movie is going it still seems to take forever to get there.  Murder Elite is very slow and delivers little suspense.  It definitely doesn't help that Ali MacGraw makes for such an unconvincing femme fatale--she has no sex appeal, displays no passion and delivers line readings so flat that when explaining why she eats yogurt or trying to talk her way out of getting a shotgun blast to the face she sounds exactly the same.  Presumably Ali MacGraw was cast because she was still a little bit of a name when  this was made but her lifeless performance kills the movie--Murder Elite needed a villain who could speak in more than a monotone and who looked and acted like someone worth killing for but Ali MacGraw has all the passion of a Stepford Wife who wandered in from the wrong movie.

Murder Elite has other problems as well--at 99 minutes it feels very padded.  The movie opens with a murder but after we are treated to a very detailed and extremely slow depiction of life on the horse farm--the chores, the people, the breakfast rituals--it's not exactly the kind of thing that promises suspense ahead and feels like it's there mostly to help stretch the slim material out to feature length.  Murder Elite would have benefited from a lot more murder and a lot less life on the farm.",1418342400,,1915,4.649851632047477
