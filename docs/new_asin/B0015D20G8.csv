Theasylum.cc
 No other studio HAS EVER  attempted a sequel to WOTW, Theasylum has proved it deserved more attention and besides C. Thomas Howell owns the role over Tom Cruise version !

I would advise watching it without any additional out-of-pocket expense, and late at night after you're too brain-dead to do anything else, including watching a more challenging and substantive movie.

3143910,3,B0015D20G8,"Let me just say that there are two movies here, one is a B movie (War of the Worlds 2) and the other is just garbage (invasion of the pod people). I can usually find something positive about the worst movie, but this was just pure garbage.

Let's look at both of the movies individually.

War of the Worlds 2 picks up where the sci-fi channel version of War of The Worlds leaves off. Same main guy (C. Thomas Howell). It's a good movie, sure it's a B movie, but if you go in for B movies this is well worth watching. I am lucky in that I was able to see it on Sci - Fi. The used version I purchased was scratched badly so, I had to miss parts. Eventually, I will get another copy. However, back to the movie. In this movie, the survivors eventually end up going to Mars through a time portal and fighting the Martians. The special FX are poor, but then it's a C. Thomas Howell movie, so low budget. I have to say I enjoyed this movie greatly. So, I recommend it.

Invasion of the pod people. It's an invasion of the body snatchers ripoff, but that we knew from the title. Went in, expecting as much. Well, the acting was worse than terrible, the pod's were really Ginger root in a planter. I would swear they used the same one for every scene. The story convoluted at best. Now, here is the kicker, when a person becomes a pod-person, then become a lesbian. And, very very sexually hungry. So, now all the major players (all ladies)end up in an orgy of sorts with them all topless. But, not for long. If are into T&A, this a waste. Why, because there is not much of that either. Just enough to get you upset that the movie went into that direction. Stay away at all costs, it's a waste of time and money.

3143912,4,B0015D20G8,"Yes, Asylum makes bad movies.  Most are one- or two-star movies at best.  ""War of the Worlds 2"" breaks the Ayslum mold by being a fun movie with good special effects and some memorable characters.  It is far from perfect, but it is fun.  I'm watching it a second time as I write this review.

Yes, this movie is ""Independence Day"" with a twist.  It's fun and makes at least as much sense as ""Independence Day"".  ""War of the Worlds 2"" provides a grim glimpse of the post-invasion world.  Two years have passed since the first War of the Worlds.  The humans have defeated the Martians, but the Earth's technology and industry remain destroyed.  And then the aliens return . . .

The characters are believable, sympathetic, and intelligent.  The special effects are good, especially for an Asylum movie.  The background music is unobtrusive as background music should be.  The plot is farfetched (Martian invasion, what do you expect?), but it has its own logic and physics to make everything work out plausibly.

Bad things:  One character has an impossibly horrid faux-Southern accent.  The audio effects are extremely loud during the battle.  The Martians are still an enigma.

Good things: The DVD extra features some magic tricks performed by C. Thomas Howell.  C. Thomas Howell is expressive.  The other actors also pull their weight.",1278460800,,1337,4.879464285714286

3143917,3,B0015D20G8,"This appears to be one of those films everyone loves to hate. C. Thomas Howell revives his breath taking role as George Herbert to combat the aliens. George has a strong name and an inability to read gas gauges. Kim Little, our overly heavy southern accent cutie is back...not as Rebecca, but a new character Vicki This is because guys like me shouldn't notice because we only watched 10 minutes of the original film before turning it off.

Inspired by ""Independence Day"" a flight crew decides to go after the mother ship and chases it through a wormhole, out sweet speaking scientist calls a ""time hole.""  Memorizing lines doesn't seem to be her strong suit. Dad meanwhile chases after his son by going into one of those ships in order to show up Tom Cruise, which unfortunately he doesn't.

Forcing someone to watch this movie would probably constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention. The acting is so poor it would make blind children cry.

3143919,4,B0015D20G8,"IMO audiences today are just spoiled. They need to be pampered with 100+ million dollar budgets in order to think a movie is good. I loved this movie, because it was fun, told a story, and didn't try and pamper me with over-priced effects. Truthjfully, I would rather watch this version of War of the Worlds than the over-priced Tom Cruise version. Despite what some may say, the acting was not bad, in fact it was every bit as good as any current A-list actor. Most of the key roles were filled with actors who at one time would have been considered A-list. Just because they are less well known today, doesn't mean their acting is bad. My hat is off to the producers of this film who understand, that not all of us have to be surprised, pampered, and emotionally stimulated when we watch a movie. Some of us just want to have fun, and that is what this movie is, 90+ minutes of good solid fun.

Everything about this film is ludicrous, and if C. Thomas Howell had any sense he'd have paid money to keep this movie from being released.  The script is nonsensical.  The acting is laughable.  The costumes and scenery are horrible, even by low-budget standards.  The ""special effects"" are embarrassing.  The music often overpowers the dialogue.  There is not a single redeeming thing about this project.  Most films that get this far off the tracks are canceled before they are completed.  I am stunned that someone thought it was worthwhile to press DVDs of this mess.

I was a bit disappointed in the Steven Spielberg version of WOTW, but this one was so bad that I could hardly stay awake. The only connection between the HG Wells' novel and this movie is the name. Everything else in the movie was at best mediocre and predictible. Some people might like it, but I thought that this ""sequel"" was badly done. The special effects were cheaply done - any highschool kid with a computer and movie editing software could do the same effects and probably do a better job of it as well. C. Thomas Howell was overacting in many of the scenes, and the man accompanying him showed a weak acting ability, and as a sniveling sidekick, it's reminiscent of the old B&W movies where the token black man was the first to die, and showed a huge yellow streak down his back before he was killed by the monster (No, the sidekick doesn't die, but he stills quakes with fear, while shouting profanities at Howell).

  The background noise drounded out the dialog and the 5.1 dolby would not register on my system (I checked with other videos and my system was fine).
  The special effects did not match the dialog. An example would be the order for the earth forces ships not to fire, every one agreeing not to, and every ship is shown firing. They do a very brief FX on the 100s of earth ships vs thousands of Martian ships and show it over and over.

3378407,3,B0015D20G8,"Let me just say that there are two movies here, one is a B movie (War of the Worlds 2) and the other is just garbage (invasion of the pod people). I can usually find something positive about the worst movie, but this was just pure garbage.

Let's look at both of the movies individually.

War of the Worlds 2 picks up where the sci-fi channel version of War of The Worlds leaves off. Same main guy (C. Thomas Howell). It's a good movie, sure it's a B movie, but if you go in for B movies this is well worth watching. I am lucky in that I was able to see it on Sci - Fi. The used version I purchased was scratched badly so, I had to miss parts. Eventually, I will get another copy. However, back to the movie. In this movie, the survivors eventually end up going to Mars through a time portal and fighting the Martians. The special FX are poor, but then it's a C. Thomas Howell movie, so low budget. I have to say I enjoyed this movie greatly. So, I recommend it.

Invasion of the pod people. It's an invasion of the body snatchers ripoff, but that we knew from the title. Went in, expecting as much. Well, the acting was worse than terrible, the pod's were really Ginger root in a planter. I would swear they used the same one for every scene. The story convoluted at best. Now, here is the kicker, when a person becomes a pod-person, then become a lesbian. And, very very sexually hungry. So, now all the major players (all ladies)end up in an orgy of sorts with them all topless. But, not for long. If are into T&A, this a waste. Why, because there is not much of that either. Just enough to get you upset that the movie went into that direction. Stay away at all costs, it's a waste of time and money.

3378409,4,B0015D20G8,"Yes, Asylum makes bad movies.  Most are one- or two-star movies at best.  ""War of the Worlds 2"" breaks the Ayslum mold by being a fun movie with good special effects and some memorable characters.  It is far from perfect, but it is fun.  I'm watching it a second time as I write this review.

Yes, this movie is ""Independence Day"" with a twist.  It's fun and makes at least as much sense as ""Independence Day"".  ""War of the Worlds 2"" provides a grim glimpse of the post-invasion world.  Two years have passed since the first War of the Worlds.  The humans have defeated the Martians, but the Earth's technology and industry remain destroyed.  And then the aliens return . . .

The characters are believable, sympathetic, and intelligent.  The special effects are good, especially for an Asylum movie.  The background music is unobtrusive as background music should be.  The plot is farfetched (Martian invasion, what do you expect?), but it has its own logic and physics to make everything work out plausibly.

Bad things:  One character has an impossibly horrid faux-Southern accent.  The audio effects are extremely loud during the battle.  The Martians are still an enigma.

Good things: The DVD extra features some magic tricks performed by C. Thomas Howell.  C. Thomas Howell is expressive.  The other actors also pull their weight.",1278460800,,1337,4.879464285714286

George has a strong name and an inability to read gas gauges. Kim Little, our overly heavy southern accent cutie is back...not as Rebecca, but a new character Vicki This is because guys like me shouldn't notice because we only watched 10 minutes of the original film before turning it off.

Inspired by ""Independence Day"" a flight crew decides to go after the mother ship and chases it through a wormhole, out sweet speaking scientist calls a ""time hole.""  Memorizing lines doesn't seem to be her strong suit. Dad meanwhile chases after his son by going into one of those ships in order to show up Tom Cruise, which unfortunately he doesn't.

I loved this movie, because it was fun, told a story, and didn't try and pamper me with over-priced effects. Truthjfully, I would rather watch this version of War of the Worlds than the over-priced Tom Cruise version. Despite what some may say, the acting was not bad, in fact it was every bit as good as any current A-list actor. Most of the key roles were filled with actors who at one time would have been considered A-list. Just because they are less well known today, doesn't mean their acting is bad. My hat is off to the producers of this film who understand, that not all of us have to be surprised, pampered, and emotionally stimulated when we watch a movie. Some of us just want to have fun, and that is what this movie is, 90+ minutes of good solid fun.

Everything about this film is ludicrous, and if C. Thomas Howell had any sense he'd have paid money to keep this movie from being released.  The script is nonsensical.  The acting is laughable.  The costumes and scenery are horrible, even by low-budget standards.  The ""special effects"" are embarrassing.  The music often overpowers the dialogue.

I was a bit disappointed in the Steven Spielberg version of WOTW, but this one was so bad that I could hardly stay awake. The only connection between the HG Wells' novel and this movie is the name. Everything else in the movie was at best mediocre and predictible. Some people might like it, but I thought that this ""sequel"" was badly done. The special effects were cheaply done - any highschool kid with a computer and movie editing software could do the same effects and probably do a better job of it as well. C. Thomas Howell was overacting in many of the scenes, and the man accompanying him showed a weak acting ability, and as a sniveling sidekick, it's reminiscent of the old B&W movies where the token black man was the first to die, and showed a huge yellow streak down his back before he was killed by the monster (No, the sidekick doesn't die, but he stills quakes with fear, while shouting profanities at Howell).

  The background noise drounded out the dialog and the 5.1 dolby would not register on my system (I checked with other videos and my system was fine).
  The special effects did not match the dialog. An example would be the order for the earth forces ships not to fire, every one agreeing not to, and every ship is shown firing. They do a very brief FX on the 100s of earth ships vs thousands of Martian ships and show it over and over.
