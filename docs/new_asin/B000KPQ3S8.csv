2696828,5,B000KPQ3S8,great stuff - will really improve your Latin dancing as well as tighten muscles and lose fat.,1183334400,6,93,4.529411764705882
2696829,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I love this workout!  With the full workout (about 40 min) it goes by really fast and I'm sweating like crazy half way through.  The quick workout (20 min) is really great if you don't have a lot of time.  There isn't really any instruction, but at any time you can use the ""help"" and they will show you how to do the move and then it goes right back to the spot you were at.  It did take me a couple of times before I was coordinated with it, but I don't get bored of it and it's fun!",1176768000,32,485,3.82
2696830,4,B000KPQ3S8,"The European women aren't near as annoying as the Denise Austin type. Yeah, they're dancers and they're in good shape, but that's to be expected. They could do this blindfolded, with a broken ankle and look better than I do. But that doesn't have to discourage anyone.

I think they teach you just like any other aerobics class. Slow for a couple steps, then to tempo. The steps I've seen aren't outlandish, though some I couldn't do the first time. I'm not coordinated and don't look good doing it. But I also don't have a problem shutting myself in a room and laughing occasionally.

If you want to get a nice workout, that's different than your normal run-of-the-mill at home fitness videos, this is a good option. It's neat how they work the abs into the cardio routine.

I'm not sure if it's worth 45$ though (that's a month subscription to my gym!).

I think some of the bad reviews on the video are just personal frustrations. The video is nicely produced and coreographed. They're good leaders. The music is made to go with the routine perfectly. You can alternate between front and back views. If the ""Latin"" dvd is too hard, you can try the others. You can skip scenes. And there's an express workout too.",1176422400,119,1215,4.585253456221198
2696831,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I love these workouts. They are high impact but a lot of fun. You actually feel like you're dancing instead of working out and the ""help"" section is very useful. If you have a problem with some of the footwork, you switch to ""help"", and then they slowly take you through the exact steps to achieve the correct footwork. If you join the club you do pay a fortune for the initial starter package DVD, but the other DVDs are reasonably priced.",1171497600,51,440,4.378048780487805
2696832,1,B000KPQ3S8,"The other reviewers are correct.  There is virtually NO instruction whatsoever included on this DVD.  I'm sure it's a great workout if you're already an experienced professional dancer, but otherwise, prepared to feel completely baffled most of the time.

Also, notice when you watch the infomercials for this product, you'll see raves from people of every age, body type and level of fitness (or lack thereof).  Well, of course, it's a commercial, so that's what you'd expect.  But also -- these people took a live version of the class, presumably with the instructors in the room with them to offer guidance, or at least answer questions.  (And presumably those people didn't have to pay for the class, either, which probably helped too.)

Finally, my copy of the DVD has an extremely irritating blue line with a little camera icon on it (I believe it's the angle selection icon) that appears ALL THE TIME, right across my TV screen and you cannot turn it off no matter what you do.  It's not only totally distracting, in my case it even gave me a little bit of a headache after a while.

Overall, I wasn't exactly blown away.",1170028800,30,1128,4.714285714285714
2696833,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I have two left feet, and I can finally dance!! I find myself sweating even after the short workout. It's a great, fun cardio workout. Definitely a keeper",1169510400,15,154,4.535714285714286
2696834,5,B000KPQ3S8,"This is one of my favorite exercise DVDs of all time - and I've tried pretty much every brand, type of exercise, and instructor on the market.  I'm not coordinated by nature, and I agree the routines can be a bit intimidating at first - it took me at least a dozen viewings before I felt confident of my ability - but that's one reason I loved the program. I like to be challenged and learn new things, so it's incredibly satisfying to practice and improve.  Now I have a blast working out, and I feel like I've learned some hot dance moves in the process.  I look forward to working out every day, which is a FIRST for me.  The instructors, Jaana and Julia, are outstanding - their enthusiasm is contagious, and the instruction is very helpful, particularly with the extra ""Help"" sections offered.  Don't be afraid of a fun challenge - if you are bored with the same old calisthenics and predictable routines, Core Rhythms is spectacular and so much fun!",1168905600,28,955,4.497109826589595
2696835,1,B000KPQ3S8,"Beware.  If you call to order this product, you will have to go through a 20 minute ordeal in which you are offered other products over and over.  Also, My brand new DVDs kept skipping throughout and the sound would go off regularly.  Very poor quality.  I was appalled.  I couldn't even use it.  As for the instruction itself, it's mediocre.  The concept is great, but the execution is not so appealing.  The music is boring.  The sets are boring and the interaction between the instructors and the audience is forced.",1168905600,57,519,4.615384615384615
2696836,1,B000KPQ3S8,Watch out. I ordered it once from the official site. They will try to trick you into buying something else. They will guide you to put all credit card information and recommend you a one-click offer at last. There is no turning back. I emailed them when I mistakenly click to accept the offer. They reply and said they had already processed and wouldn't accept a return on that bottle of diet pills. They said it was on sale but I checked on that. They charge double the market price. You should be careful. It will be Dytrexil Hoodia Gordonii. They offerred it at 29.90. Chech this out. [...],1168473600,36,593,4.4495412844036695

I bought this used & the dvds play great! I totally recommend buying used dvds. Saves money & gives someone else the opportunity to benefit.  Good instruction, but I'm quick with choreography.",1472256000,2,356,4.619047619047619

I lost 30lbs when I started it. It's fun and gets you pumped up and really does work your core. The first week I started to see a huge difference in my stomach and hips! Great for people targeting the mid section! As well as all workouts you have to get in the habit! I use he quick workout and its 25 min and condenses all of the extreme stuff in to that short of time, like if your at a crunch for time. Or hate the hour long workouts that are too drawn out.

I just finished doing the full ab workout DVD and the lower body sculpt workout. Boy did I feel it! Terrific workout, and the time passes quickly. It's working your abs and your glutes and your thighs but feels like dancing. I am so happy I found this DVD set. Can't wait to try the Latin dance DVD.",1461974400,,442,4.337349397590361

2696852,3,B000KPQ3S8,This is a first for me.  It was very similar to some other Latin dance exercises but it focuses on the core and so can become tedious.  There are several different DVD's and you can pick what level you want to learn.  They ladies are enthusiastic and not annoying.  I like Zumba better.,1431648000,,286,4.339622641509434

2696867,5,B000KPQ3S8,A friend recommended it to me and I recommend it to anyone who gets tired with the same routine. The instructors are high energy but let you follow at your own pace. Doesn't even feel like your working out.,1396310400,5,206,4.3076923076923075

2696870,5,B000KPQ3S8,"This set of exercise discs is the only one that I've ever tried that is so simple and so much fun that you want to continue doing it. Instead of some skinny lady taking you through impossible steps, the two instructors make you feel like you're part of a friendly group. You can follow the moves from the front or behind, and you can go into the dance studio to be taught the step if you don't get it. Best of all, it actually works! After a couple of weeks of the 20-minute starter program, I was able to do the 45 minute workout without puffing and panting and I felt great.",1388448000,5,576,4.151785714285714

2696879,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I ordered this DVD because I wanted to vary my cardio workouts.  I'm only doing the kickstart portion right now because the other workouts are a little to fast for me, but I will get there.  I've noticed that my hard to tone areas like my waistl/sides, back and sides of hips are slimming down and toning up.  I'm  also getting a lot of shoulder and arm work.  The kickstart movements are very easy to learn, the music is great and the instructors are fun.  The difficulty is  you do a lot of repetitions, but you don't get bored.  You just get so tired that your're ready for the next exercise.  You also have to keep your arms up.  The first couple of workouts, I had to rest my arms, but I'm use to it now.  My flexibility has increased so each workout I feel like I expend a little more energy.  The kickstart is not a high intensity workout, so I am really surprised at the quick and continued results that I' m getting.  The other workouts on this DVD are high intensity and I'm looking forward to being able to do them.",1363737600,13,1026,4.22680412371134

The basics DVD was a perfect place to start for dance novices like me, and even during the regular program, if you got confused with the steps, you could go to the help menu for a breakdown of the moves.

I've done this a few times, and there are a few steps that I don't have down yet. It seems like some of the more challenging steps get rushed. I'm not a dancer, but I think it's fun to try. :)
When I gauge a workout, I look to see if it makes me sweat, and feel sore later. This workout can help you break into a sweat, but it probably won't make you sore the next day. I was hoping that my abs would feel worked out, but i think it would take a little more to accomplish that.
I do like the quick workout option, which is convenient, and helps to cement some of the steps of the full workout.

I only did the Kick Start video for a couple of days to get the basic moves. I do the Quick workout about 3 times a week and the Full Workout 2 times a week (to the best of my ability). I've done this routine for about 3 1/2 weeks now and I've lost an inch in my waist. Both workouts make me sweat. There are a couple of moves that I can't do because of a bad knee and a couple of moves that would bounce the living room too much, but I've modified the moves to something my knee and living room can handle. Also, there are some moves that you need to pivot, which may be difficult if you have carpet.

It also comes with dance instructions for 4 different latin dances and it comes with a dvd to get you started moving (KIck Start).

So, she thinks this is more potent than other things she tried(ie, electric belt, Hawaiian dance moves, and such)

2696893,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I was apprehensive in the beginning after reading the other reviews, but I was willing to purchase it and give it time because dance workouts are never easy in the beginning. When I watched the Kick Starter workout and tried it the moves clicked right away. Then I did the workout and it was so much fun and I was smiling throughout the workout, which is rare. The moves were very easy and I didn't find the workout difficult at all I have rhythm so that's probably why. I was sweating and feeling the burn so I know that it is an effective workout I just have to keep on doing it. I wanted to incorporate dance workouts into my routine and this is the perfect workout to start out with. If you are looking for a workout that is challenging but is also not boring I recommend this workout it is good for all fitness levels, and you certainly won't be going through the motions. I like that the instructors actually teach you the basic moves step by step before going uptempo and watching the instructors using the back view really helps. If you can dance the workout won't be difficult, but If you don't get the moves at first don't get discouraged as long as you are moving that's all that matters, because you are still getting a workout just keep working at it like anything new you start in life.

2696894,4,B000KPQ3S8,"I've been working out with this DVD set since late 2009. Am I as tight as Jaana & Julia? No. Have I slimmed down significantly (and where they claim - core section)? Yes. People have noticed, but more importantly I don't find the exercise to be a burdensome chore.

I had purchased this set for about $50 from Target on a whim, as I was desperate for a ""dance"" workout - something that does the job & fun. I was disappointed at the amount of content on the DVDs (Lower Body Sculpt - 1 workout, Secret to Sexy Abs - 2, Latin Cardio Jam - 1, and Merengue Mania - 2, with one workout being an unusable to me which was the 2-person dance instruction). I had expected at least 2 legitimate workouts per DVD for the money. That is the main reason why the set gets downgraded from 5 stars to 4.

There are a few awkward moves, and there is a learning curve. Yet compared to the more intricate steps of Zumba, this workout is fairly easy to learn. The workouts have a very genuine & happy feel. The workout partners in the back look normal, not plastic. The workout leaders - Jaana & Julia - make some funny mistakes, but it adds to cool vibe of the workouts. [Jaana's colorful hair and Julia's colorful personality make a difference too!] Also, there is variety in this 4-pack DVD (merengue, salsa, bolero, swing). No workout lasts more than 43 minutes; actually, most are closer to 30 minutes. The actual workout music is motivating, not annoying.

Sometimes people have high expectations of exercise DVDs when they don't put in the necessary work. I don't care much for gym memberships and workout machines, particularly during the winter. I aimed to find a workout DVD set that would be interesting enough to help me keep consistent in my exercising. The workout could feature sexy (but not stripper like) moves, but wouldn't require that I sit or lay on the floor. Since late 2009, I've exercised with these 4 DVDs 3 to 5 times a week. Mission accomplished with this set. Thank you Jaana & Julia!

Obviously, the price has dropped dramatically (to under $20). I'm find with it because I was mostly happy with my purchase. You will likely be even happier at the prices offered now.

I would love to purchase Jaana Kunitz's Xtreme Cardio Dance set (2009) via Amazon, but it doesn't seem available. :-( Her web site has ""untrusted connections"" pages at the moment, so I can't purchase it from there.",1298505600,6,2393,4.530092592592593

2696901,4,B000KPQ3S8,"I bought this DVD last month and decided to try it out.  I tried the 40min version first and nearly died.  It was very fast after doing the warm up and sometimes hard to follow but I kept at it.  I could only do half of it, maybe less than that.  I've been doing tae bo for at least 5 days a week for 2 months.  But I needed something that would help with my stomach.  This helps with stomach, your legs and back thighs because of the hip and leg work.  Plus you don't have to get on the floor to do any of the moves.  I'm a big fan of non-floor exercises.  I started doing the 20min version after my 40min fiasco and slowly worked my way up to the longer version.  I've replaced this with tae bo and only do that ocassionally.  I like the dance workout alot better because it doesn't feel like a torture session.  I'm going to buy the other sets of these just to switch up.  Keep at it and you will notice a difference in your hip, legs and stomach.  It will be kinda frustrating at first but you can do it.

2696910,4,B000KPQ3S8,"I agree with another reviewer that most of the low ratings are due to frustrations rather than the actual product. The fact is that this is designed to teach people to dance while getting a workout. Keyword being dance, which is never easy if you are a beginner. It requires time and patience, and results often happen when you least expect it.

I just got this a week ago and started with the kick start DVD. I am very uncoordinated and horrible at keeping time and this was very helpful. Now, the key is, once that becomes easy, don't expect to be able to do the full workout. I did the kick start section every day for a week and often times would repeat the workouts 2 or 3 times to make sure I fully got the moves. The fact is that if you are good, but not great, at those moves then the full workout will be kind of hard. Muscle memory is key.

The other thing I did was watch both the full and quick workouts while I was stretching. It's good to know what to expect so that when you go into the workout you don't have to keep rewinding. When I started out I just repeated the warm up a few times because that alone is pretty energetic (I'm also short on time usually).

Overall I really enjoy this. It's fun, pretty low impact knee-wise (maybe that's because I'm too worried about stomping and pissing off my neighbors below me), and I have actually become a way better dancer - which is shocking considering I have issues walking. You just have to go into this with an open mind and know that you don't have to do the full anything, you can break it down into sections and seriously go at your own pace. Don't let your frustrations get the better of you.

My only complaints are that they don't do enough 8 counts and the music could be a bit better. The thing with the 8 counts is that, for me personally, I can't count music too well, so it'd be nice to throw those in from the beginning so you can train yourself to the beat better.",1252627200,18,1943,4.201072386058981

2696912,2,B000KPQ3S8,I want to start by saying that the Kick Start DVD that I received was a faulty CD. It would not play completely and froze every 5-10 seconds. I now understand what some previous reviews have stated about this DVD. One of the women's accent is very thick and it is difficult to follow her instructions. I have had some dance training before so I thought I could manage but her directions were unclear and she had the dance moves that are very fast paced so that was difficult in and of itself. I found myself skipping her parts and only doing the dance moves that Jaana taught. You can actually feel your core working when you are doing the slow to medium tempo moves. I think I'll go back to belly dancing.,1251849600,3,706,4.315789473684211
2696913,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I bought this after seeing it on tv.  I got the starter pack and the sculpting pack (Lower Body Sculpt, Latin Cardio Jam, and Secret to Sexy Abs).  I must say, I have a blast doing these and use the dvd's 3 to 4 times a week, usually before I do some strength training.

The Kick Start dvd will teach you the basic moves and steps that are the fundamentals for the rest of the dvds.  Once you learn these steps, you won't use this dvd BUT this kickstart is necessary to learn how to do the moves CORRECTLY.  If you don't do the moves correctly, you won't feel the burn or get any benefits from them.

The Full Workout (45 min.) and Quick Workout (20 min.)dvds are fun cardio workouts.  They are good for getting you in basic shape and if you are in a hurry.  I used these a lot in the beginning but hardly use them now because I really like their sculpt ones the best.

The beginner set comes with a Latin Dance Made Easy and I can't comment on this because I have not tried it.  My hubby just thinks this is silly and won't try to learn it with me.

Now onto the good stuff:

Lower Body Sculpt:  It's only 25 minutes long but it is effective!!  You can easily squeeze this workout in before going to work but beware - you will work up a sweat.  I did not think this was going to be that much of a cardio workout but it is, you're doing the merengue and samba in this workout. I'm relatively sweaty after doing this.  It involves a lot of lunges and squats (timed to music while constantly moving your arms) so beware if you have knee problems.  I do this DVD every few days and I have begun to notice my legs are getting so much stronger, firmer and more toned.  I haven't noticed my legs bulking up either which is always a concern of mine.  I just really enjoy this workout and I think Jaana is a really effective instructor (she is ACE certified btw.).

Latin Cardio Jam: (30 min.) This is a cardio workout and it did work up a sweat.  I'm not a big fan of Julia because she seems to have disproportionately short legs and for some reason that bothers me when watching her do the dance moves. (I like Jaana much better)  However, once I got over that, this workout was a lot of fun.  It has the merengue, samba and swing and I think the swing is my favorite because it was the hardest for me and made me feel like I was part of a broadway show.  This is great for days when you're legs are sore from all the lunges in the Lower Body Sculpt.

Secret to Sexy Abs - This is a good dvd but you really need to make sure you know the proper way to perform the moves.  I would not attempt this dvd until you have done the others and feel comfortable with the ""bouncing"" ab motion.  Once you have that motion down, this becomes a nice ab workout.

Overall, I have been really happy with this set and have found that I look forward to the workouts and often will find ways to squeeze them in even when I didn't plan on doing them on a particular day.",1247702400,29,2945,4.092495636998255
2696914,5,B000KPQ3S8,"I loved their first 4-dvd set, and I borrowed part of this set (Body Sculpting)from the library: the Latin Cardio Jam (30-40 min, great dancing) on disc 2 & the Secret to Sexy abs (35 min part dance, part toning) & Abs in a hurry (7 min mostly standing crunch style) on disc 3. The first one, Lower body Sculpt was unavailable.
As always, the women are all great dancers, great motivators & love to have a little fun. I had no problem following, I don't have any dance class experience, they go slow & break it down first for all new moves. This is a little different as it doesn't have the help or back view options, but does have ""make it louder"" option to hear the music more & instruction less. The music isn't bad, it was just good enough to keep me going.

I tried this workout and loved it! As a former dancer, perhaps this is why I find the workout challenging but fun.  However, I also like the fact that I was sweating from head to toe in 15 minutes but did not feel like my heart was going to burst out my chest!  The only downside is that the Jaana Kunitz and Julia Powers do not carefully explain the dance moves before really going into them.  They also do not give you enough notice as to when they are about to switch moves.  Even for a dancer, it can be frustrating.  But stick with it!

2696917,3,B000KPQ3S8,"I've mostly done the ""Full Work-out"" DVD and have mixed feelings about it. The work out is fun compared to other work-outs and very good for hips but not a full body work-out. I actually did lose 1 1/2 inches on my waist in a month and a half (I also did seperate cardio added to my work-outs though), but no weight loss. I like the energy of the instructors, they seem like they really like what they're doing, really get into some of the movements that are more dance-like and smile a lot. I do find that it's hard on my knees. It also, at first, was hard on my back. I have mild scoliosis and often have some back pain but after sticking with it, sometimes pushing it and sometimes taking it easier, I found that my back was stronger and the back pain I normally feel quite regularly was virtually gone. I did find that the instructors often didn't describe or prompt the upcoming step which was frustrating at first but after doing the DVD over and over you come to memorize the moves, still it seemed unprofessional, you should want people to suceed, give them advance notice of what's coming to keep the heart rate up and not have a jerky work-out trying to catch-up. I'm quite coordinated and have done a lot of exercise programs in the past and was disappointed by this. I also thought the stretching part was far less than adequate, way too short and they didn't hold the stretches for long enough, I'm naturally flexible and have actually lost flexibility. Overall I think it's a fun work-out, the instructors have a great energy and I have seen results in my waist and hips but it isn't perfect there are some obvious flaws.",1242604800,10,1635,4.4352159468438535

Nothing to read others' comments and frustrations or suggestions. Just loud bawdy ads bleating success.

For one, there is a bothersome little icon right in the middle of the screen that will NOT go off - it is a movie projector, with numbers that do not seem to correlate to anything.

For another, the FIRST DVD - the Intro one, was good - it was slow and repetitive - I felt very hopeful, and was fun - good moves.

But the ""full workout"" was a MESS. I thought at first that I had skipped an entire DVD - it is soo different from the first one. I am definitely calling for my money back - I read on internet sites that you can slow it down, but there is NO HINT of how to do that (if you can) - and it is very fast and jerky - not at all graceful. VERY, VERY fast. It is difficult to know when a ""new"" move is introduced (it is hard to hear), to access ""help"" menu - and then I am flicking back and forth, and sometimes there IS no new move - it just looks like it (and you must go back to the last new move - skipping back and repeating). It is a mess.

It would be GREAT if you could watch the ""help"" sessions in succession, with more repetitions, to really learn it before it is put together. The setting is much nicer with the ""help"" lessons - not so loud and obnoxious as the staged (very fast) version, with the huge midriff on the screen behind - very distracting and tacky.

The combination of cardio to burn fat and the dance moves in this program would really trim down the waistline. I sweat a lot after I'm done with the full workout and just a light sweat from the 20 min.routine. This program mixed with Turbo Jam, Rebounding, Speed Intervals, different kinds of Strength Training routines, yoga/pilates, etc. and sensible eating gave me results over time.

In the 40 min. routine, I still can't do the ""moving figure 8"". But that doesn't stop me from having this as part of my rotation. I would just do that move in place. Any move that I can't exactly copy, I just keep 'circling' my hips. I also exaggerate the moves as they recommend. Yeah, I look silly but that's the beauty of working out at home, no one sees me. When I do either the 20 min. or 40 min. routine, I don't feel the need to add any ab workout anymore since it's already there unlike my other cardio routines (except for Turbo Jam).

I felt like I just wasn't getting it and it was making me feel very frustrated.  But you'd have trouble too if English wasn't your first language!  What I do love is the two ladies' enthusiasm and spirit in the workout.  Plus, what a great way to get excellent abs without having to lie on the floor and do crunches that hurt your neck and are boring!  I found that, much like most dance/cardio type of workouts I try, I just had to do this a few times before I started learning to do the steps without even watching them anymore.  So if you are frustrated by the lack of instruction, just don't give up.  Keep on trying, and before you know it you will know the workout like the back of your hand.  And then you will really look forward to doing it because of the inches you will be losing off your waist!  I am very glad I bought this workout!",1192147200,16,1019,4.184615384615385
2696936,1,B000KPQ3S8,"I thought the intro package was great, but it went downhill from there.  The intro package has a long and short workout.  The rest of the videos have only the long workout.  In total I have 5 of these videos.  They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive.  DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE!  It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected.  I sent back a duplicate product but they never did give me credit for it.  Kept me on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time too when I had to call; and I had to call at least 8 times!",1187568000,21,594,4.017094017094017
2696937,1,B000KPQ3S8,"This product is terrible. It's hard to understand what the blonde chick is saying, they start dancing and when they want to change a step they don't really let you know they do not do the countdown like any other teaching program, it was very dissapointing. The Music is aweful. Then if you buy it through their own website beware of clicking on products you do not want, there is no remove item buttons, it was insane, I ended up with 3 orders. The only good thins is that they will give you your money back.",1184198400,27,509,4.3125
