257873,5,6300216721,"This film is faithful to the book, which is always a plus for Agatha Christie adaptions. The set and cast are excellent, with the plot moving at a brisk pace. Albert Finney is a good but hyper Hercule Poirot, Ingrid  Bergman won an Oscar for her Bible beating Swedish maid, Lauren Bacall is  an American motormouth, Sean Connery is a Colonel, and Anthony Perkins and  Martin Balsam are brought together again (echoes of PSYCHO?). An odious man  is murdered while the famed Orient Express is caught in a snowdrift, which  means the murderer is still on board. As Poirot questions each of the  passengers, her learns the shocking truth of the solution to the murder.  Excellent.",946166400,9,676,4.775862068965517

257875,5,6300216721,"Colorful characters, a brilliant script, great touches of humor and a cool atmosphere make this a real treat for the mystery buff, especially if you're an Agatha Christie fan. The cast is superb with big Hollywood names  playing the suspected murderer. Twists and startling clues will grab your  attention and will not let go until the killer is revealed. Keeps you  guessing till the final frames of the film. Ingrid Bergman won her third  Oscar for this film, this time as Best Supporting Actress as an emotionally  frail Swedish missionary.

258638,5,6300216721,"Poirot has always been one of my favorite British TV Series because of it's lead David Suchet who is one of the most underrated actors.
He is to Poirot what Sean Connery is to James Bond 007 and his predecessor of the Poirot role is Martin Gabe who would in my opinion be the Lazerby Bond.

That said, Kenneth Branagh is the Daniel Craig of 007 whom has redefined Bond from a comedic role to a serious one with far more depth in the newest freshest and totally different version.

Mr. Branagh has gone beyond even David Suchet's Poirot which is a task in itself, with the same dignity that the Poirot character has always brought to the screen, but in emotional 3D (this film is not in 3D) in depth of character.

Branagh has such a deep body of work, and comparatively one of the still most underrated actors of our time, regardless of his success and critical acclaim.

Ordinarily, a movie with a cast such heavyweights as Madame Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz, the timeless Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnny Depp in a much refreshing role apart from being a pirate, would be easy to distract from Branagh's Poirot if it were not Branagh.

This movie for anyone who loved Poirot will understand what an INCREDIBLE job Branagh has done in what is already in my opinion a classic.

Branagh is unlike many of the great actors of Hollywood in the sense that he so comfortably blends into the character that you see no seam between the character he plays and who you might think Kenneth Branagh is.

Meryl Streep, Daniel Day Lewis, etc. always have that little bit of who they are left to identify that even Tom Hardy is challenged by Mr. Branagh's uncanny ability to become the character without trace of him.

Branagh's Poirot is a more human, realistic character that truly reflects the passion of what a real Poirot would be like.
The constant tension from within for order of an OCD mind to the absolute embracing of the beauty of life even in the simplest things, though expressed with the classic Poirot reserve and candor.

Immediately one could say this will be one of Branagh's best works, but I somehow believe this man is far from his best yet.

Excellent storyline, excellent performances by all of the cast and Bravo! to Sir Kenneth!",1524960000,7,2243,4.598997493734336
258639,1,6300216721,Very boring. The pace of the narration is very slow and it doesnt catch the interest of the spectator.

258770,2,6300216721,"I debated between 1 and 2 stars for this  stinker and decided to give it two because I like some of the stars in it, though they have precious little to do. Johnny Depp, who used to be a fine, though idiosyncratic, actor, continues his string of exaggerated one-note characters. It's no longer funny, just painful to watch. Penelope Cruz, whom I admire a great deal, has nothing to do and the character she plays --a drab with a past-- takes little advantage of her vibrant attractiveness and strong-willed intelligence. Judi Dench --how can anything Judi Dench does go wrong?-- is given little to do as a crotchety uber-rich old woman. She comes across as tyrannical and  spoiled but not as human. Michelle Pfeiffer, another of my favorite actress and an intelligent, capable artist, is missed, cut down, caricaturized. Well, you know, that's what everyone in this clicker of a movie is reduced to.  When you start with one of dame Agatha Christie's most preposterous and poorly written Golden Age thrillers, you're at a disadvantage to begin with. The only way out is effective exaggeration --vide Albert Finney and Poirot in Death on the Nile, the very effective PBS Poirot series and the charming Miss Marple films. This one isn't those. It's dreck.

Oh! I haven't mentioned Kenneth Branagh yet.  He plays Poirot. Again, an exceptional actor but hes maybe the worst Poirot Ive seen. He just doesnt seem to get it. Poirot is a grotesque, intentionally so by the authors desire. He needs to be played that way. The actor filling the role of Ppirot needs to find a way to express Poirots utter ridiculousness in a way that still makes him human. Branagh is closer to a robot.",1524700800,,1676,4.76551724137931

I could not give this movie five stars because it did not have enough of Johnny in it.  I won't say much more- don't want to give the plot away but the little time that he was in it was entertaining and even though he plays a villain, you have to laugh at his funny character and feel sorry for him.  My favorite character that he plays is always Captain Jack in the pirate movie but I digress.  The ending was quite heart wrenching and more brutal than the murders-you will need tissue and find someone to watch it with who won't make fun of you if you cry.  I would recommend this to those who like murder mysteries but not too much gore.  It was a psychological thriller- you find yourself guessing through the whole movie until the very end where everything comes to a grinding halt(yes, I know thats a train metahor.). The scenary is quite beautiful and it was a time when pleasantries and manners were had and shown.  You don't see and hear disgusting language, gore, and nudity.  This is a beautiful movie about the human psychology.  I did not like the crappy song playing at the movie when the credits rolled.  The lyrics and singing were deplorable.  But the good part is that the movies already done before Michelle Pfeiffer starts singing so you either tap to stop on your phone like I did or scramble out of the theatre to get away.",1523664000,,1483,4.3140794223826715

Read the book many, many years ago and knew there was an older film adaption but I've never seen that one. This movie was epic though!
Kenneth Branagh, amazing! He is the perfect cheeky intellect that we know as Hercules Poirot.
The other wonderful collection of cast members helped make this story come alive. Loved the set design too. The hubby and I both had a couple of 'Oh, wow!' moments while watching. Some of the scenes were really beautiful.
Even if you haven't read the book, or seen the older film, see this one. My hubby was oblivious to reading Agatha Christie's book, but still loved this movie.

259715,3,6300216721,"Don't people read books anymore. I have read Agatha Christie's, Murder on the Orient Express, and Evil Under the Sun. In all films, and TV shows, directors, and screenwriters deviate from Agatha Christie's Hurcule Poirot books in a big way.

I know this is always the case, due to box office sales, but to change it radically takes away the originality from the author.

In every film or movie, Hucule Poirot description varies.

If you take David Suchet's head, place it on Albert Finney's body. Trade David Suchet's moustache with Kenneth Branagh's moustache. Use the impeccable clothing of David Suchet's Poirot. You have the true Christie's funny little Belgian. Poirot was a small funny looking man with an egg shape head. Kenneth Branagh's accent of Poirot just doesn't cut it, but Branagh's moustache does. Poirot's eyes are Belgian green, not German blue.

Where in the hell did a kung fu count come from? Did I miss that part in Christie's book where the count, in the movie uses a Chinese scissors kick! I'm surprised the director didn't ask Jet Li to play the count.

I'll write it, I don't understand how an African-American got into the movie. Because in Murder on the Orient Express, ""This coach is empty save for myself and one little Greek doctor."" Dr. Constantine was greek and short. Not black and tall. Did the director or producers fear criticism from the NAACP if they didn't use an African American? Stick to the book!

In finding the killing knife, the movie dipicts it is stuck in the shoulder of Mrs. Hubbard. The authors book, ""Mrs. Hubbard burst in. Its too horrible, she cried. Its just too horrible. In my sponge bag. My sponge bag. A great knifeall over blood.

I hate movies that don't stay true the the book.  Author's work so hard to write a book, only to for directors to get screen writers to change it.",1523318400,,1838,4.70404984423676

259872,4,6300216721,"There are some people who love this and some who hate this. I'm the former.

I admit the plot isn't perfect. There is some difficulty juggling all the characters, some of Poirot's deductions seem more like very lucky guesswork, and not enough info. is given for the audience to look back and say they could have figured the movie out. Still, the movie was still very entertaining to me. Yes, the original movie was far better plotted and made more sense. However, it was very slow-paced. This one is far more breezy and entertaining.

Visually, the film looks great containing vintage-looking sets and costumes with bright lighting and colors. Music and some creative camera work really set the mood. Stick around for the end credits. There's a very good song there. What the script lacks in plotting, it makes up with good dialogue, both the funny and dramatic variety.

The acting's all top notch, which is to be expected from such an all-star cast. Unfortunately, what with there being so many characters, not all of them get the chance so shine as brightly as others. Still Michelle Pfeiffer, Josh Gad, and Willem Dafoe all have some great scenes.

As for Kenneth Branagh, I really liked him in the role as Hercule Poirot. It isn't easy for a mainstream film these days to star an eccentric middle-aged guy who isn't action-oriented, but Brannagh pulls it off. He plays Poirot's many moods quite well. He's at times comically eccentric, a serious fighter of crime, rude, or extremely likable.

If you don't have the patience for following a mystery and drama, this movie isn't for you. But, I highly recommend this to everyone else.",1523145600,,1636,4.807829181494662

This just didn't work for me especially the fight sequences. I've seen Albert Finney's Poirot,Peter Ustinov's Poirot and David Suchet's Poirot, they are much better fits for the character than Branagh.  Poirot was not a fit active young man in Murder on the Orient Express, he was aging and overweight. Also if you are going to remake such a famous story it really would be good to hit it from a different point of view.  The recent David Suchet version was really superb.  Poirot""s character was outraged by this act and it profoundly affected him, because he is a deeply moral man.  See it for the supporting cast which is awesome.

Author Agatha Christie's detective novel comes to life in a motion picture for the first time.

The movie begins in 1930 at the home of the Armstrongs on Long Island, New York. It is 3:00am. People inside the house are either tied up to a chair or knocked on the head unconscious as the baby, Daisy Armstrong, is kidnapped from her home.
  The next day, as a private plane lands piloted by Sonia Armstrong and Colonel Hamish Armstrong, the reporters run to the plane to tell these parents their baby is gone.  They pay a ransom, but Daisy is said to have been slain.

Colonel Arbuthnot (Sean Connery) meets with Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave) on board. They are all on their way to the Turkish train station.  There we meet our all-star cast of characters whom will board the Orient Express train to Calais.
  Bianchi (Martin Balsam) helps his friend Poirot get a seat and a sleeping berth on the train. Bianchi is the director of the line after all.
  After they have left the Belgrade station, later that day, the train is caught in a snow drift in Yugoslavia. It is bed time and Poirot tries to get some sleep, but is disturbed by knocks on the doors and other sounds.

260082,2,6300216721,"As a Christie fan, I find this film to be a horrible ""interpretation"" of her book.  Kenneth Branagh's mustache is so far from what Poirot's was that it's laughable -- and that soul patch is completely ridiculous.  (Oh, for the days of David Suchet.)  Worse than that, they changed the story.  They even changed the ending!  Also, the attempt to add ""action"" to the story is completely misguided.  Hercule Poirot is not an action hero.  This script fails to honor Agatha Christie's legacy and is an offensive attempt to ""rework"" a story that doesn't need to be ""reworked"".  When making a film of a book - especially one as detailed as each of Christie's is -- one should stick with the story.  As far as technical aspects of the film:  the cinematography and set design are wonderful.  The lighting is a bit dark for my taste.  I suppose Branagh (also the director - no ego there!) was going for something dark and mysterious.  If you're a Christie fan, don't waste your time.",1522886400,5,975,4.598837209302325

i thought this different Poirot was a unique interpretation and if you watch the film without making comparisons, it stands nicely on its own.

Well done Judi Dench, the film's only mildly watchable character - the fault of the thinly written plot, not you -  for not having fed your face to the hungry surgeons and ruining it like the other aging actors here have, and who, in so doing, have rendered themselves sadly unexpressive.",1522627200,,685,5.04424778761062

Yes, they could have cast it differently, but I don't think it would have improved the movie.  The one thing, the BIG THING that makes this movie stand out is that they used the actual train cars and photos of the actual train. I've ridden on this train twice and the remakes ignored the fact that the train is out of this world!  It speaks to an era that we've lost in this world and we need to get back (that's why the train is always booked solid).

The opening scenes of the train were shot with cars that were not operating. At the time the movie was shot, if I'm not mistaken, the train was not running and the cars were shot as they were sitting unused.  The car where Poirot does his interrogating is the Lalique car, named that because of the priceless Lalique panels gracing its walls.  The shots of the corridors with a stained glass window?  Those were shot in the current kitchen/baggage car.  Wonderful movie and a great bit of acting (and sometimes overacting).",1522454400,17,1120,4.429268292682927

As with the previous productions, this version was full of world class actors led by Kenneth Branagh, who tried to 'pull off' his idea of Hercule Poirot.

260528,1,6300216721,"I'm not sure why the filmmakers thought they needed to completely destroy Christie's characters, but they did. There's really nothing here that's Agatha Christie. There are a lot of silly blockbuster cliches that just make you want to laugh or roll your eyes, there's quite a bit of misogyny, which isn't exactly foreign to Christie, but at least her brand of misogyny has to do with intent, not male fantasy. I'm so disappointed in this version of the classic. I bought it because I respect Branagh, but he really let down the audience with this production. I do love the way he looks as Poirot -- the best visual depiction I've ever seen. But he completely misses the mark on the deeper qualities.

Anyone giving this movie more than two stars is not a Christie fan and hasn't had the pleasure of her original story. There is a trend recently to redo Christie in a darker, more cynical, more ""modern"" style, but she doesn't need modernizing. Her characters are timeless, her plots are intricate, and her stories are fun and engaging. I will say the cinematography is beautiful.

And the story was pushed too fast. It was very hard to follow at times (and I know the story from seeing the original film and having read the book...and I still found it hard to follow)

The whole bit referencing the Lindbergh Baby wasn't nearly played out enough. It was tacked into the middle of the story then again at the end. It felt like the story was being forced into that story line rather than that storyline forming around the characters.

A black British policeman in 1934 Jerusalem who happens to be the obliging good guy against the corrupt white officer?  Really? I know Sikhs were certainly used to police the International Settlement in Shanghai and no doubt natives were recruited to the police force in colonial British Africa, but Jerusalem in 1934?  Even the hotel employee who serves Poirot his eggs appears black rather than Arab. I found this jarring and unrealistic from any depiction  I've read in first hand accounts,  seen in films or newsreels as well as contemporary photographs. Odom as Dr. Arbuthnot?  I've not seen the guy act before, but he would have suspended by disbelief with both his good looks and his acting ability if hadn't, hitherto his appearance, already seen a stream of  discordant liberal fascist good intentions.  I take it this ""fresh"" angle was a condition of funding?  Or is it  the handiwork of a mediocre director attempting to detract attention from his own banality with flashes of pseudo avant-gard nuances? We're living in strange times and the first ten minutes was more a reflection of the angst of the childish white liberal than about Agatha Christie and her work.

260816,2,6300216721,"Yet another remake of the old preposterous Agatha Christie tale that doesnt add much if anything to previous attempts to film it. The problem with the Christie story is that it makes no sense whatsoever- a dozen (it seems) people conspire to travels thousands of miles in order be be the only passengers on a train aside from their intended murder victim, a thief and con man who probably could have been killed closer to home and with a lot less trouble. The story works if one is willing to suspend all reasonable doubt and rationality, and accept that this is how things unwind in the world. That, I think, is why David Suchets characterization of Poirot was so successful. He appeared to have stepped right from the pages of one of Christies stories, as much a fictional artifact as her plots.

Branaghs Poirot tries to capture the Christie characterization while making him more of a real person, one with emotions and feelings, and that simply doesnt work. (His outrageous mustache seems a very forced mannerism as well). The opening scene, in which he is called away from breakfast to solve a robbery that threatens the peace of Jerusalem is clever, if a bit forced in parts, but once he boards his train things go ever so slowly downhill. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, but they are in the end let down by the story. Branagh is a favorite actor and director of mine (especially for his smaller films like Winters Tale) but this one deserves a miss.",1521676800,,1469,4.671814671814672

I hate when a book is made into the movie and the movie is nothing like the book even the main character was nothing like the description of him in the book.  To me this movie was made to poke fun at Christie and the Hercule Poirot character.  There are many older better made movies made of this book this movie was a waste of money shame on Hollywood actors do your research before you take a role this movie is a giant joke.,1521676800,,577,4.2272727272727275

I hated the overhead shots. Not only was everything claustrophobic but it was unnecessary.  There were ridiculous action scenes that were out of place in a cozy mystery. Too much ""Sturm und  drang"", that might made the plot ridiculous. What they did to the characters of the Andreynis was criminal. The earlier movie was a class act - this was an uneven mishmash of melodramatic misses. I am glad I only rented it but s $4.99, I feel I was overcharged.",1521590400,2,619,4.722222222222222

I had a hard time following the plot and the scene transitions, despite already knowing it from having read the book and watched multiple adaptations in the past.

261139,3,6300216721,"I want to specify that I am reviewing the 2016 version of the film starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh, as it appears that Amazon lumps in the reviews for multiple film adaptations of this story into one place.

I'm giving this movie 3 stars, which Amazon classifies as ""it's ok"". That's really what it is, just okay. As an avid fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot stories, I had a hard time watching this movie despite looking forward to seeing it for a long time. This movie has quite the star studded cast of actors, and it seems like they had a luxurious budget for this film, as the sets were very beautiful. However, the story was lacking. Within the first few moments of the movie I was already annoyed by how much they had taken liberties with the character of Poirot. They push this heavy handed concept of Poirot as this wounded man cursed with OCD-induced hyper awareness, rather than an expert detective who revels in the use of his ""little gray cells"".
For having such a high profile cast, each character felt like a minor role, leaving a feeling that they were chosen purely for their celebrity and not for how well they may or may not perform the role. That's not to say that they acted poorly, so much as to that it really felt lazy. I believe that is largely the fault of the direction. This story is supposed to be a gripping murder mystery, but instead felt like a slapdash action movie with a heavy handed sorrowful overtone that distracted from the actual story more than it helped. This was a somewhat sloppy adaptation of the original story. As indicated by my 3 star rating, it wasn't a horrible movie but it wasn't great either. It was just...okay.",1520726400,,1674,4.524752475247524

It's hard for anyone to replace the Poirot character as developed by David Suchet.  He defines Poirot for those of us who've gotten to know Poirot thru him.  That said, Brannaugh is a superb actor and did a good job.  Likewise, Depp was superb as the evil-doer.  Really hateful man!

If you've never read the book or watched any previous renditions of this story, you might find it more appealing. However, those of us who have appreciated the Hercule Poirot of the days of yore - most notably as portrayed by the late Peter Ustinov in several other Hercule Poirot mysteries - will undoubtedly frown at Kenneth Branagh's decidedly substandard performance. If you're going to play a foreign national, Mr. Branagh, at least get the accent and pronunciation right!

Leaving aside my personal gripe with Hollywoods perennial, ridiculous practice of casting people who are NOT the nationality they portray and then forcing the audience to suffer through variously terrible accents, mannerisms etc...

The whole cast was, at best, ho-hum. I felt that the whole movie rested heavily on what was thought to bring cache to the story - casting previously well-known actresses like Penelope Cruz (with a snooze-worthy, forgettable performance) and Michelle Pfeiffer, whose plasticky face was entirely distracting - alongside Johnny Depp and his equally boring, unremarkable performance, you're left with a story that should be engaging, should be mysterious...but just ends up being tedious and best relegated to the pile of ""movies never to watch again"". Equally groan-worthy was Leslie Odom Jr.'s bizarre accent - variously American, pretend-British...just ridiculous.

Even Dame Judi Dench - an incredibly gifted actress I normally adore on screen - couldn't save this tired snooze-fest.

261330,2,6300216721,"This re-telling of Agatha Christie's classic tale has good points and bad points.  I find the ensemble cast particularly noteworthy; kudos to casting.  Although Kenneth Branagh's Poirot has his problems, the actor still has a commanding presence on screen.  I felt each of re-vamped characters had  at least one golden moment, and the lovely Michelle Pfeiffer practically stole the show.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't mind that the characters are re-written:  I feel it was unnecessary, but even the classic 1974 version (which seems to be the standard of perfection among Agatha Christie adaptations) is not 100% true to the book.  Beautiful scenery.

However:

The film was riddled with problems.  The individual characters each had a golden moment, but each character also had a moment that was sheer nonsense.  I won't write any spoilers, but it is one thing to update and refine characters, it is another thing entirely to form outlandish caricatures of them.  (How much did they pay poor Penelope Cruz, Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton to say those wretched lines?  Not enough...) And WHO was responsible for Branagh's make-up?  With that big of a budget, there should have at least been some make-up that worked with his skin tone!  He looked sallow and in some spots the edges were so visible as to create a mask-like effect.  I don't have enough scathing words for the mustache, so I'll move along.  Hercule Poirot is subtly drawn in Christie's works as cat-like:  finicky, devoted to his creature comforts, and notoriously precise. This Poirot was none of those, but rather portrayed as a victim of OCD.  I said before, I don't mind updating characters, but this was the most un-Poirot-like portrayal to date.  Not bad for a generic detective, but this WASN'T a generic detective--it was supposed to be Poirot! I found some of the camera angles were dizzying and muddled the moments with their novelty.  There were several CGI and blue-screen moments that were obvious and created an atmosphere not in keeping with the emotional points of the story.

SUMMARY:  Starting with zero stars, I add one each for: Michelle Pfeiffer's performance, the all-star cast, the lovely scenery, Kenneth Branagh's command of the stage and the originality of taking old material and making it a current project.  I take away stars for: over-complicated technical tricks that didn't quite ring true, Branagh's distracting mustache and make-up (his make-up is REALLY bad),  and those over-the-top moments that were simply too over-the-top for me.",1520121600,7,2550,5.086746987951807

I am a diehard Christie fan, own the entire collection of movies, so I have been excited to see this since it was first announced. I knew since Sir Branagh was at the helm as well as starring, it should be superb, and it did not disappoint. What an amazing cast and fantastic scenery. I am hoping the mention of the  Murder on the Nile at the end is a hint that he may have a few more Poirot movies up his sleeve.",1519948800,,470,4.164835164835165

261471,5,6300216721,"LOVED every minute of it!!!!  Prior to selecting this movie to watch, I read reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and other sources.  Based on those reviews, especially those on Rotten Tomatoes, I thought this movie would be boring and overly long and definitely not as good as the original.  Kenneth Branagh was criticized for the way he played Hercule Poirot as being too in love with himself in the role.  I don't agree at all.  He directed the movie and was the leading character, which might explain that criticism, but it was unwarranted criticism.  That being said, I was influenced by the negative ratings I'd read and expected not to enjoy this movie.  I am so happy I ignored the reviews because I was thoroughly surprised by how good it was.  And, well worth the cost.  Bravo to Kenneth Branagh!  I've seen the original a few times and if I had to compare the two, the original characters seemed bigger: larger than life, more theatrical and dramatic. For example, Lauren Bacall as Mrs. Hubbard, was a force to be reckoned with, a heavy weight of an actress, bursting with energy which kept my interest and my favorite character in the original.  Michelle Pfeiffer didn't play Mrs. Hubbard with that same crackling fire, devil-may-care attitude. Nonetheless, Pfeiffer's acting chops are well-honed and her balance of vulnerability and quiet strength gave Ms. Hubbard a more human side and emotional life that was missing from the original.  The original Hercule Poirot was a little eccentric, more of a comedic caricature at times whereas Kenneth Branagh's Poirot, was more serious and gave a more intellectual, realistic portrayal which I preferred.  Johnny Depp was in true form and had the character down, I knew from get-go who he was portraying, and I love Dame Judi Dench in anything, she is a tour de force and so beyond good, she can reveal a story through her eyes.  I disagree that the talents of this ensemble of top star talent was wasted.  While each of the actors played a cameo part, each made an equally effective contribution to the overall success of this movie.  the cinematography is stunning and nostalgic luxury train travel setting engaged the senses.  I will watch it again.  And, I highly recommend it!!!",1519776000,6,2230,4.839050131926121
261472,1,6300216721,"Very boring! PBS Masterpiece Mysteries were more exciting than this despite the all-star cast.

The 1974 version was far superior to this one and that one wasn't great.  Both films had the same level of star power.  The 1974 cast was as formidable as this one.  In 1974, the story was at least very much parallel to the book.  This one takes a lot of artistic license and it does it no good.  It is unbearably slow, with gratuitous scenes that add nothing to the story and constant references to what a genius Poirot is.  However much he may think himself a genius, his revelations often occur long after the audience has realized them.  Boring and badly done.  With this kind of cast, it is a travesty.  While yawning through this snoozefest, all I could think was, ""Thank God I only spent 14.00.  I would have spent $30.00 at the movies.""

Certainly not performances: Depp, Pfeiffer and Dench were at their worst, and Brannagh was simply terrible with his hollow parody of Suchet who has always done a perfectly credible performance of Poirot. The worst thing about Brannagh was his terrible accent that wandered everywhere and a ridiculous moustache that also managed to travel a good deal.

Agatha Christie's name is renowned in the realm of ""who done it"" mysteries but if this story is indicative of her plot lines, she's not too adept.  The concept of the plot is fairly unbelievable.  I won't give it away for any who haven't read the book or seen the movie but what the killer(s) set out to accomplish could easily have been done without a trip halfway around the globe.  I think the most absurd bit though is Poirot.  He is not a ""great detective"" as he purports himself to be.  His conclusions are impossible w/o some sort of psychic powers.  Rather than skillfully elicit info from his interviews or from forensic analysis, he  inexplicably presents narratives to his subjects outlining exactly what they did and their motivation w/o the slightest indication of how he came to these ironclad conclusions.

Albert Finneys Poirot is distracting.  Instead of calm and contemplative, his portrayal is rushed and bumbling (for Harry Potter fans, think of the uncharacteristic portrayal of Dumbledore in HP 4). There are few aha! moments during the interrogation scenes. Most interrogations are loaded with irrelevant questions, and then we are left to hear most of Poirots revelations summarized at the anticlimactic end. Poirot makes proclamations such as And youyou are the maids father! that seem to be extraordinarily improbable given the information shown on-screen.",1512000000,2,796,5.352

This was by far the worst, with poor audio and surprisingly bad acting: characters' emotions seemed out of place for the situations they were in and lines were frequently delivered in ways that just don't fit right.

This is the most faithful adaptation of a novel I've ever seen. Albert Finney is superb as Poirot, his hair net and moustache  bib are a hoot!

For me the soundtrack, here, is an awful contrast to the plot, Tony Perkins is terrible (but the more I recall him wasn't he always so) and Poirot is certainly different from Christie's version but still enjoyable. Overall I liked this version better than Branagh's.

I guess I'll look for the TV version and re-read the novel",1511308800,8,718,4.609375

261859,5,6300216721,"Agatha Christie attended the premiere of this film and proclaimed it the best and only satisfying adaptation of her novels and it's no wonder. Superb director Sidney Lumet and a cast that can truly be called all-star make this sumptuously mounted period mystery into a true classic. Lumet usually directed serious films like Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Pawnbroker and Serpico and would go on to direct Dog Day Afternoon, Network and The Verdict. This film was almost like a vacation for him from darker material but of course he gave it his all. it had its own share of potential problems with its large cast, complex plot and confined shooting space. He came through making a film that was nominated for six Academy Awards and won Best Actress for Ingrid Bergman. It also spawned a series of sequels which was unusual then.

The cast also came through, even the smaller parts were excellent; it's no mean feat to get a bunch of established and rising stars to act so well together as an ensemble. Not only that but the tone of the film - which was as a subtly comic rather than a realistic, tense drama -  required them to be just a bit over the top without falling into caricature. Like the extravagant costumes, each character is played as the epitome of their type, a difficult balancing act for an actor who risks overdoing it. The result is that even with such a large cast each character is memorable and the audience can identify each and every one of them. The script is perfectly balanced with each character getting time in what could have become an Hercule Poirot vehicle. Albert Finney is absolutely unrecognizable as Poirot (would you believe Finney was only 37?) and it's not just make-up but his whole way of being. His portrayal is quirky but not buffoonish. Martin Balsam is dependable in a rather large role for him (think Breakfast At Tiffany's or Psycho). Lauren Bacall's talkative American and Sean Connery's Colonel are spot on. John Gielgud personifies the perfect English butler as only he could. The two up-and-comers, Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset make a wonderfully haughty but loving pair of Hungarian nobles. And Vanessa Redgrave is herself lovingly devoted to Connery's Colonel in that way of hers that lights up the screen. Anthony Perkins is appropriately creepy as is Rachel Roberts Hildegarde, a hard boiled German maid to exiled Russian Princess Dragomiroff (Dame Wendy Hiller). Ingrid Bergman's missionary, Greta, is such a country woman that Bergman had to take coaching lessons to develop a thick Swedish accent after her years as a Hollywood actress had erased her own. Everyone else is great as well.

The film is super lush in every way. It's a Valentine, a tribute to old genre films, but done up grandly in a way they could never afford. For one thing it was kept in 1930, the period in the novel and not updated to the present to save money. The Locomotive engine was the actual engine of the Orient Express. The cars were detailed reconstructions. The interiors are letter perfect from the burled wood paneling to the dining car lamps. No expense was spared on the costumes either, which are as lush as all the rest. The music is kept low key and unobtrusive (which Lumet liked) except when the train takes off and Richard Rodney Bennett's delightful waltz appears with full orchestra. Despite it's over two hour running time, narrow set and talky script the time goes by very quickly. It may not have as much ""action"" as current-day movie goers might like but all others should find this a totally entertaining classic.",1510704000,15,3578,4.786407766990291

Albert Finney, literally, threw himself into the role, but I kept remembering HIM as Scrooge. The entire cast is wonderful!

261919,1,6300216721,"Film 4 of 1974 and 15 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

Two strange things happened while watching this. First was the beginning, which was very well done, in which I turned to my wife and said that  this is exactly how I imagined the Charles Lindbergh kidnapping case must have went down. As it turns out that is what inspired some of Agatha Christie's book. It was also a compliment to Sydney Lumet and the power of his directoral abilities. The second odd thing that happened was half way through the film I wondered if this was worse than ""Serpico.""  It had somehow escaped my notice that Lumet had directed both. For the record ""The Orient Express"" is the better film and I think Lumet is a great director despite my not caring for these two movies. Speaking of his expertise I thought his use of flashbacks, which at times seemed excessive and unnecessary, was actually quite brilliant. It set up a God's eye view of the murder quite well without a cheesie dream sequence taking place in the mind of Poirot. Speaking of our main character Inspector Poirot, oh my, quite dull. I have read that he is beloved. Why? Because he's an inspector? That's all that he is. The entire train conspired to confuse him because he is so consumed with being an inspector. I would have liked it more if he was flawed and was dealing with personal demons. The movie, not necessarily the story, lacked tension. I thought the murder was supposed to be a pressing matter that had to be solved before the track was cleared? It never felt that way and that may have been intentional. Intentional or not the story needed a drive of some sort. As it was I felt stuck on the train but not in a good way. Rather I felt stuck with a bunch of people who just talk too much. The golden rule of film is to show me don't tell me. Now I know that would be quite impossible for this story but I don't care. A movie needs to adhere to its own limitations even if a story needs to be changed from its source material. As I understand it Christie thought her book was well adapted here. Uh oh, that's not good. Most productions don't allow authors to be on set and for good reason. Think Steven King and HIS favorite version of ""The Shining."" That's right, the process of writing for a reader is so different from writing a script and making a movie for a viewing audience that the author needs to have a remote relationship to the production. Her praise should have been cause for concern. In short I was bored. It was a similar feeling to when a friend kept me on the phone one time for a half hour describing how to craft a bow and arrow: ruthlessly boring. Two more things, the ending was clever and I really enjoyed it. I would have loved to address the idea of vigilante justice but it would require me to watch the movie again and that's not going to happen. Secondly, the make up is very noticeable. While they made the lead actor look older and did a great job at that I was distracted at times by the make up on other actors. I shouldn't even be able to notice it but I could.
Pros
Well directed
Well acted
Great beginning
Great ending
High production values
I imagine if you like the book this is a faithful interpretation
Cons
Too much dialogue
Boring
Shallow main character (he's an inspector!)

So far I have found these older films to be a pleasant surprise but this one was the embodiment of my apprehension to explore them in the first place. Still 1974 has been quite good for a film buff like me. I doubt any movie this year will be able to top ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" however. I still can't get that one out of my mind.",1502496000,4,3633,4.3460972017673045

While David Suchet portrayal for the long-running BBC Hercule Poirot series is, indeed brilliant, the BBC adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express took too many liberties with the source marterial and, frankly, was plodding, rather than suspenseful.  The 1974 version is so far superior in every respect, that I would advise against even considering other versions.

The delightful score was by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett.

While one or two of these performances are rather externalized, all are of interest, and reigning over all is the immense performance of Dame Wendy as the Princesse Natalia Dragomiroff.  Imperious, fiery, and exotic, in her cabin she is surrounded by photographs of, and decorations from, the last Imperial Family of Russia, as well as a pair of Pekingese and a German maid who reads Goethe to her.  She is seen in heavy, pale make-up, covered in large jewels, and wearing, in turn, furs, veils, and a multitude of feathers.

The Princesse is also droll:  At the end of the interview she has granted to Hercule Poirot, the Belgian detective asks, ""You never smile, Madame la Princesse?""  Her Highness responds, ""My doctor has advised against it.""

Dame Wendy, who in her youth was admired by no less than George Bernard Shaw, is electrifying in one of cinema's great performances.",1501027200,3,1411,5.149122807017544

261999,5,6300216721,"Take the genius of Sidney Lumet, the ability of Paul Dehn to humorously adapt quirky Agatha Christie's bestseller into a fun and frolicking screenplay, then throw in A Dozen Astronomical Superstars backed up by five astronomical stars, and you have one of the most entertaining classic films ever made.  Albert Finney!  As Hercule Poirot, you cannot even tell it is Albert Finney!  Then there is Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Richard Widmark, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, Jacqueline Bisset, Rachel Roberts, and Jean Pierre Casel and Wendy Hiller to round out the expensive star collection, a veritable galaxy of entertainment, which is essentially comedy that slightly bends Agatha's murder mystery with intentional overacting and bluster from the whole cast.

Sydney Lumet uses this vehicle to wink and nod at the golden age of Hollywood, all in good fun and tastefully, even lovingly, crafted as only a maestro director can!  Finney does steal the show with his amazing take on Poirot, but there is a lot of room for Bacall and Bergman, Connery and Perkins, to all pop their respective balloons in time.  In addition to directing and the all-star cast, the cinematography and design for the film and sets are monumental, a colorful feast for the eyes that often gets overlooked because of the cast.  The digital sound quality of the DVD is wonderful but as was in the theatrical release is Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono with a slight upgrade to 5.1 which envelopes you but is not true surround.  The film transfer on my 2004 release (purchased in 2007 and in regular rotation for viewing, still looks fantastic) is beautiful, sharp, and on a 70"" looks every bit as good as the theater I watched it in back in 1974, actually better since the clarity seems to be sharper without any loss or blackening.

This production is 'glorious'. I have always loved it from the very first moment I saw it as a girl back in the 70's on television. In 'Express', Finney's performance is exquisite as is everything about this production. I'm a big film fan of the past...the only reason we kept cable as long as we did was for me to have access to TCM. Recently we cut the cable cord and I am purchasing my favorite films on DVD. 'Express' was at the top of my list. I remember that I used to hear the musical score on the radio as well, it is as lush and sumptuous as is the time period itself (for the wealthy I mean). Lastly, it's truly a feast for the eyes, as Art Deco is clearly on fine display throughout the entire train.",1483747200,13,861,4.161676646706587
262015,5,6300216721,"Thanks to brilliant directing by Sidney Lumet, an incredible immersion into character by Albert Finney, and an all-star ensemble, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is one of the best adaptations of Agatha Christie's works to film.  Virtually all of the action takes place in the confined spaces on a train - the dining compartment, the individual sleepers, and the suffocating hallways in between.  It is amazing to imagine the tight spaces that these brilliant people confined themselves to for months to shoot this film.

Without giving any spoilers, I'll just say, if you have never seen it before, pay attention.  You may be able to pick up on something that will be helpful later on.  If you have seen it before, pay attention.  Those little clues can be put together on the next viewing even better and you may realize how much you missed the first time.  I'm not sure how many times I've watched it, but I usually feel like I picked up on something new.

Christie's writing is faithfully attended to in the film, and as mentioned above, the acting is superb.  Ingrid Bergman won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role in the film, and it's just a shame the other actors (especially Finney) did not.

In some ways, ""Orient Express"" feels like the easiest of Christie's movies to remake, but even if it were to be done again, watch this version.  There is no way to top this star-studded classic.",1483660800,15,1412,4.699186991869919

262041,5,6300216721,"That endangered species, the pure detective story, came back with a star-spangled bang in Murder On The Orient Express, which had no time for the touch violence of the modern private-eye school but plenty (over two hours of it) for the deduction and surprise denouement that have made Agatha Christie a perennial best-seller.  That was its strength and its weakness: the plot and the characters held suspense and fascination, but there were so many interviews by a garrulous sleuth (Christie's immortal Hercule Poirot) with secret-hiding suspects in a confined setting (a snowbound train) that monotony increasingly threatened before the killers of an American millionaire were unmasked.  Practically the whole cast of characters had been connected years before by a Lindbergh-type kidnap case- and what a cast!  Albert Finney dominated as Poirot, with Ingrid Bergman (winning her thrid Oscar), Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, John Gielgud, Wnedy Hiller, Michael York, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, Rachel Roberts, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Colin Blakly, George Coulouris and Dennis Quilley.  That lot ensured big box-office as well as accomplished performances.  The Christie book's 1930s period was retained by Paul Dehn's screenplay, produced in England by John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin, and elegantly directed by Sidney Lumet.",1481155200,,1382,5.721951219512195

This film is gorgeous to look at, it has a fabulous musical score and twelve, count them twelve, major stars as the suspects.  This all makes the tv version with Mr. Suchet look rather dowdy.  His suspects may not be big stars, but they are more than competent, actors, I mean they're British for Petesake!, whose faces, if not their names, you may know.  Mr. Finney and his twelve stars, many cast against type, acting up a storm and having a whale of a good time in the process, are hard to resist.

262420,5,6300216721,"There are films from 1974 which don't age well despite being re-released for DVD/BLU RAY. This is one of those films that have aged spectacularly. Though this was a period film even back in 1974, I think its done most marvellously. There is poise and elegance in the script and though never frantic, the film kept my wife and I enthralled last night. The story though complex is elucidated in a very simple pedestrian manner. I would speak of the story if cataloguing would help my review but hey it is every bit as grasping as an Oscar nominated film should be. We watched it because of how many oscars it had won. The most marvellous facet of the film is life going on somewhere and to be introduced to so many characters so delectably introduced. As a viewer you consider all avenues of course but you never quite know that the film will keep you guessing until is almost over. There is plenty of humour, you would want to be on the correct side of the dialogues [guess thats why we had the english subs on] because so much is sad, miss one sentence and you'll feel...well sentenced.

Full marks for acting and location. This is the sort of suspense, adventurous film that dictates its own term and is beyond the reproach of the critic because it is so tastefully done. I am now very keen to embark on more Agatha Christie books and films. Sean Connery's poise is immaculate and Ingrid B. is ever so unforgettable and then there were those ladies who's name I don't know but they will resurface in many conversations of the future untold. I really really recommend you watch this film, own it, steal it, borrow it. It is every bit as good or better than the films we watch today. In a time where there weren't so many things that occupied us, we were untouched by phones and well were touched or rather amused by one another's peculiarities.

262473,5,6300216721,"Even if you are not a murder mystery fan, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is the all-time masterpiece of crime puzzles and won't disappoint. The film has everything from an interesting premise to a huge cast of kooky suspects that is almost like a who's who of Hollywood in the mid-1970's. The characters include an aristocratic couple, an old Russian princess, a scatterbrained American actress, a neurotic young man, a British military officer, a butler, and an American business magnate. And of course there is the famous Belgian detective who is always being mistaken for a Frenchmen, played brilliantly by Albert Finny, one of the most underrated actors of the 20th century.

A tendency with Agatha Christie murder mysteries is they often follow a predictable formula: introduction of the characters who will become suspects, a set-up for the murder, the murder itself, the investigation and interrogation, and a formal presentation of the solution to the suspects. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" does have many of these aspects. However, there are moments of unpredictability in which the investigation/interrogation becomes a kind of character study of the suspects. And the final solution is one of the most mind-blowing the genre has ever offered.

Briefly, unlike other Christie offerings, the film begins with a kind of movie news story of the kidnapping of a little girl, Daisy Armstrong, most likely inspired by the Lindbergh kidnapping case of the early 1930's. Then fast-forward, and the narrative begins with Hercule Poirot, the internationally famous investigator, being called to London on important business while still in Istanbul. He decides to take the Orient Express back to Western Europe. Because the trip was last-minute, his accommodations are a bit precarious the first night, but after wards he settles into the trip. The next morning while on the train, a fellow passenger, American business magnate Mr Ratchett, solicits Poirot to investigate some life-threatening notes he has been receiving. Ratchett offers $15,000 (probably $200,000 in today's money) to look into the case, but Poirot declines the offer. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment. The manager of the train asks Poirot to take the case, partially to side-step any lengthy investigation or bad publicity the train and the passengers might be forced to endure. Poirot accepts the case and begins questioning each of the passengers. He then learns that each of the passengers have an interesting unforeseen connection to the murdered man...

A compelling case from start to finish with a stylistic flair reminiscent of the days of old Hollywood, which are at least partially represented by Lauren Becall and the late Ingrid Bergman. And, if you haven't seen this film before, part of the fun is to solve the mystery before Poirot does! But know there are many clues in unexpected places... The presentation of the final solution is one of the best of any of Agatha Christie's mystery movies. Great escapist fun.",1431734400,,3038,5.1959183673469385

If nothing else, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is worth viewing for lead actor Albert Finney's performance, French accent-hampered English and all. it is not easy to take my eyes off Finney despite the cast of accomplished actors surrounding him - and many deserve praise, especially Ingrid Bergman, looking remarkably little like the woman who stars in CASABLANCA.",1431129600,2,621,4.980769230769231

My only picky comment - letting the screen go dark with a shot of a train at night, and then suddenly turning on the front headlight right in your eyes ... that was cheap, tawdry and shows lack of respect for the viewer. You could equally well get their attention with an unwarned shot of a bloody dead baby but I wouldn't like that either. Still, that is two seconds out of two hours and some fault can be forgiven.",1424736000,,632,4.180327868852459
262596,4,6300216721,"Having loved the book for years, I'm glad to now own the movie version.

While traveling back to England on the Orient Express train from the Middle East, detective Hercule Poirot is asked by a train company director to investigate the just-occurred murder of one of the train's passengers, a mysterious and malicious character named Rachett.  While investigating the scene of the crime, Poirot remarks that there almost seem to be too many clues present--some that point to an unknown suspect and other that suggest various of the train's other passengers--all of whom have alibis and seemingly no motive for murder.  Seemingly.  Neither was the victim who he pretended to be, and his true identity (that of a man believed to be the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of a little girl several years earlier) may provide something of a possible reason for his death.  But Poirot doesn't stop digging, any more than the workers trying to dig out the stranded train from the snowdrift it became stuck in right around the time of the murder, and presents two possible solutions of the crime to the railroad director.

I do like the premise of the story and how the investigation and solution unfold. I think I would have preferred it the movie had opened like the book did, with the past crime of the victim not being revealed until later on (rather than as a prologue to start the movie as they did here).

I like the cinematography, costumes, and music.  And almost all of the actors are spot on perfect.  My huge issue with casting is with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot.  To me, Poirot is and has always been David Suchet.  He seems to embody the seemingly unassuming and cerebral Poirot; Finney, on the other hand is a lot more bombastic and physical. His accent (real or assumed, I don't know) is very harsh and grating and doesn't seem like a natural Belgian/French accent.  As one of the special features reveals, he wasn't the first (or even second) choice for the role and the filmmakers admit that he was too young for the part.  How much that might play into this, I'm not sure.",1424736000,,2097,4.6811989100817435

262815,3,6300216721,"The first in the quarter of mysteries produced by John Goodwin and Richard Brabourne has the starriest cast of all of them - Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud and Jean-Pierre Cassel all have the chance to flex their acting muscles in a generally acceptable version of the Christie classic.  Albert Finney is miscast as Poirot; as well as being too young for the role, he overdoes the gravelly voice and walks with his head cocked on one side, almost as if he is suffering from a stiff neck.  Nonetheless he has good support from ex-Mercury Theater company member George Colouris as a bumbling doctor and Martin Balsam as the director of the railway, with a ludicrous Italian accent.

In fact, cod accents are one of the hallmarks of this adaptation.  As well as Balsam, we have Rachel Roberts as a German ladies' maid, Michael York as a Hungarian count, Wendy Hiller as a mittel-European aristocrat, and Denis Quilley as an Italian-American car salesperson.  Add to that Bergman's comic Anglo-Swedish series of guttural grunts (she always refers to that ""yung man,"" to complete a the linguistic panoply.

But Christie adaptations are not the place to look for verisimilitude.  What matters more is how the murder and the solution has been staged.  Director Sidney Lumet has great fun directing his large cast in the confined spaces of a luxury train: one can sense the obvious discomfort experienced by Perkins' McQueen as Poirot comes to share his already confined cabin.  In another sequence, Balsam  has to balance Hiller's two Pekingese dogs in both hands while Poirot interrogates her; it's hardly surprising that he cannot drink the proffered glass of brandy.  The film also benefits from bringing disparate sets of characters together: Poirot recoils in horror as he listens to Bacall's Mrs. Hubbard braying at the top of her voice about her second husband's exploits.  Later on, Lumet shows Connery's Col. Arbuthnot becoming more and more disturbed as he sees Redgrave's Mary Debenham (his lover) being closely interrogated by Poirot in one of the train compartments.  In an all-star epic such as this, it's characters that matter, and Lumet does them proud.

The solution is particularly complicated; and the film benefits from showing it acted out in full, rather than letting Poirot describe it to the assembled company in the third person.  For once in Christie, there is a sense of poetic justice about what happens.

An entertaining piece, marred only by one historical inaccuracy.  In the early sequences shot in Istanbul, we see an orchestra of Turkish musicians playing, all of them wearing fezzes.

262947,5,6300216721,"Reviewed by: Revit

Murder on the Orient Express, was one of Agatha Christie's greatest mysteries. It was inspired by the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, written in 1933 and published in 1934. This movie, staring Albert Finney as Poirot, was the first and by far the best of three movies based on Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. It was released in the United States in November of 1974. The other two movies, the second staring Alfred Molina as Poirot and the third staring David Suchet as Poirot, have been reviewed under those headings.

This film was directed by the gifted Sidney Lumet. Its star studded cast included: Albert Finney as Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot, Lauren Bacall as Martha Hubbard, Sean Connery as Col. Arbuthnot, Ingred Bergman as Greta Ohlsson from Sweden, Wendy Hiller as Prices Dragomiroff, Anthony Perkins as Hector McQueen, Ratchett's secretary, Jean Pierre Cassel as Pierre Michel, Sir John Gilgud as Beddres, Richard Windmark as Samuel Ratchett, and several more filling all twelve available births in the Calais Coach. After the first stop of the train Martin Balsam as M. Bouc, a director of the Orient Express Compagnie International des Wagons-lits was the only passenger in the second class car. Twelve is an important number in this mystery; it is also the number of tried and true men in a British jury.

The story begins when Poirot, who had just completed a little affair in Syria and had planed on spending a few days in Stamboul (Istanbul), received a telegram from London asking him to return home with all speed. He immediately booked passage on the Orient Express to Calais; it was the fastest and most luxurious train in the world. At the Tokatlian hotel he met an old friend, who was a director of the Orient Express and would join him on the trip to Calais. They boarded the train which traveled at high speed but stopped in the middle of the night between Vincovei and Brod in north-central Yugoslavia. A heavy snow storm built up so much snow that huge drifts from the high ground slid down surrounding the train preventing it from moving forward or backward and prevented anyone from leaving the train. The next morning Ratchett was found dead in his cabin with twelve stab wounds. M. Bouc pleaded with Poirot to investigate and solve the case explaining that the Brod police lacked the experience.

Poirot soon discovered that Ratchett was really Cassetti the man responsible for the Armstrong kidnapping, the murder of little Daisy Armstrong, and a total of five deaths resulting from that crime. Hours and hours of questioning followed, and even though it all took place in the train's atmosphere of luxury and glamour, tensions mounted. Soon it became apparent that rescue by a rail mounted snow plow was near and they would have to face the police from Brod.

Poirot asked all of the passengers in the Calais Coach to gather in the dinning car where he would reveal the solution to the crime. In a long monolog Poirot described two solutions for the crime and asked M. Bouc, a director of the line, to choose the one that would be presented to the Brod police. The first and simplest solution was murder by an unknown, but possibly Mafia related, person who boarded the train at the Belgrade or Vincovei station wearing a Wagons-lits conductor's uniform with a pass key in his pocket. He repeatedly and violently stabbed Ratchett who was under the influence of a sleeping drug and left his compartment through the pass door to the next compartment where he lost a button from his coat and deposited the dagger in the occupant's luggage. At the next station he removed the conductor's uniform, which he wore over his regular clothes, and departed the train. The second solution involved more people and scandal and although deserved, a repulsive murder. Twelve people from the Calais Coach who had their lives destroyed by the kidnapping and murder of little Daisy Armstrong collectively planned and carried out the sentence on Cassetti that the courts passed but failed to execute. M. Bouc chose one of the two solutions, at which point Agatha Christie's story ends with Poirot saying, ""having placed my solutions before you, I have the honor to retire from the case...""

If you add this disc to your collection you can repeatedly consider and reconsider all of the facts, weigh the emotions and come to your own conclusion; and then compare your conclusion with the one in the movie. We know that Dame Agatha Christie viewed justice as not always being identical to the law.  This is truly a great story, written by one of the greatest mystery writers of all times. It was made into a terrific movie with a stunning cast and deserves a place in the history of cinema and in your library of Great Movies. It has definitely earned five stars.",1389744000,,4823,4.831719128329298
262948,5,6300216721,"what a fun movie with a wonderful cast perfect all round , along with Death on the Nile they stand out as the TWO best Agatha Christie books to be filmed with The Mirror Crack'd coming in third . the rest you can forget . it was great to see misses Taylor Novak and Lansbury in a movie together and talk about bitchy but NOT as good as Nile and Express they do stand out .",1389052800,,372,3.9078947368421053
262949,4,6300216721,"Agatha Christie movies were all the rage for a time, and Hollywood churned them out (and television, and Direct to Video) and the public gobbled them up, and while they can often feel like a slice of Mystery Dinner Theater some of them have sustained our attentions and have continued to deliver welcome diversions from the day.  1974s Murder on the Orient Express is one of those films, and it is obviously bolstered by an all-star cast doing everything they can to make this work (even though I fail to understand Bergmans Oscar, and I love her generally).

The basic premise follows Christies hero, Hercule Poirot, as he tries to uncover the mystery surrounding the murder of a millionaire aboard a train who is stabbed to death in the middle of the night.  He interviews the trains many passengers looking for clues to the murder, and ultimately uncovers something unexpected.

The twist was pretty perfect.

Like I said, the cast is pretty great.  Finney, Bacall, Bergman, Connery,  Perkins, Redgrave, Hiller, Bisset, Balsam, Gielgud, Roberts and York make for a really interesting and well-rounded cast, and while none of them stand out as amazing to me (seriously, I wouldnt have nominated any of them) they all support the film well with uniformly solid work.

Technical aspects keep the film engaging, especially the crisp cinematography, and the plot points are worked out really well here.  It can feel a tad stuffy in parts, and it doesnt beg to be revisited, but if you like a good murder mystery, and one that pays off in the end with a nice twist, then this is one youll watch to watch.",1389052800,,1601,4.771739130434782

The rest of the cast does their duty, but it's an up-hill battle. Also, it's necessary to have read the book to make sense of the movie. Things weren't changed so much as left out entirely.

263062,5,6300216721,"This film has taken a lot of heat in the years since its release, but to me remains an amazing adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's best novels - even if you CAN see the end coming.

Not to age myself, but I ""discovered"" this novel at the age of twelve, when I started seeing TV commercials for the film and wanted to read the book first.  I did, LOVING IT, and that book started my lifelong devotion to Chritie's mystery novels - one that continues to this day.

I was lucky to first see this film in a theater - when all the splendor of the Orient Express was even larger-than-life on the big screen.  The film captivated me with its charm and look and sense of period style alone ... but when you also have a cast that includes Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Dame Wendy Hiller, Sean Connery, Lynn Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins, Richard Widmark, and more, you know you're in for something special.

Basically, while traveling on the Orient Express, the great detective Hercule Poirot (Finney) is approached by a sleazy American businessman named Ratchett (Widmark), who wants to hire Poirot as a bodyguard due to a series of threatening letters he's received.  Poirtot, disliking both Ratchett and his methods, turns the man down flat ... and sure enough, the next morning Ratchett is found in his locked compartment, dead, with drugs in his system and thirteen stab wounds to the chest and stomach.

There are, it turns out, no shortage of suspects aboard, and as the true identity and history of Ratchett comes to light, Poirot realizes that pretty much everyone in the first-class section of the train train had a motive.  And with the train stuck in the middle of the mountains thanks to a snowdrift on the tracks, it's up to Poirot - at the behest of the train company - to solve the murder before the train reaches its destination and the Yugoslavian police take over.

A lot has been said, negatively, about Finney's portrayal of Poirot here, especially in the years since David Suchet began so successfully portraying the character on television.  For me, Finney's Poirot was perfect; vain, fastidious, egotistical, and even slightly manic (sometimes to the point of being a bit intimidating or scary); to me that WAS Poirot in the novels I read growing up.  Even the egg-shaped head is correct, in this film!  =0)

And even with the sometimes heavy-handedness of the material here, this film remains a feast for the eyes, and wholly worth watching for the romantic time period it invokes.  And then there is that cast, the actors in the film who are like the cherries on an already-delicious sundae.",1369094400,5,2641,4.7254901960784315

263121,5,6300216721,"We've often enjoyed watching Murder on the Orient Express over the years on TV and DVD. I've only recently read the book for the first time on Kindle, and was frankly quite amazed to see how faithful the movie was to Christie's novel of the same title written in 1934. Since most of the story takes place on a train, it was relatively easy for producers to keep the movie closely aligned to the book even in many small details, and I'm grateful that they did. After reading the book and seeing how Christie portrayed Poirot as being a more quiet and low key personality, I can appreciate that some criticize the selection and performance of Albert Finney as Poirot because he is often quite emotional and demonstrative, as well as physically different than the Poirot Christie described. This is the only major difference between the 1974 movie and the book, though it can be a crucial difference for Christie fans.

Christie's story is loosely based on the actual kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's 20-month-old son in 1932. A $50,000 ransom was paid but the baby was murdered and his body was found two months later. A household servant who was suspected by the police of playing a part in the kidnapping did commit suicide.

In Christie's story, Hercule Poirot is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. The train is halted at night because of heavy snow and a passenger is found murdered in his bed the following morning. A doctor happens to be on board and tells Poirot that there are twelve stab wounds in the body. Everyone in the coach is a suspect, but what was the motive? Poirot must wade through the maze of contradictory clues and apparent impossibilities, some of which make him recall a child kidnapping/murder that happened a few years previously.

The 1974 movie was stylishly done with great performances by an all star cast, and the music is also wonderful.

263156,3,6300216721,"Murder on the Orient Express is a 1974 British mystery film directed by Sidney Lumet, starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot, and based on the 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie. It demonstrated that ""The greatest cast of suspicious characters ever involved in murder"" could, at a modest investment of US$m2, produce $m36 in box office takings. The film is good Christie and average Poirot, and giving it three out of five stars is generous.

Poirot, is asked by his friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a train company director, to investigate the murder of an American business tycoon, Mr. Ratchett (Richard Widmark), aboard a train with an all-star cast of suspects, including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman (delivering an Oscar-winning performance), Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York and Anthony Perkins. The screenplay was penned by Paul Dehn and an uncredited Anthony Shaffer.

That night the train is caught in heavy snow in the Balkans. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin. Poirot and Bianchi work together to solve the case. They enlist the help of Greek Dr Constantine (George Coulouris), a medical doctor travelling in another coach with Bianchi, as the only other passenger and thus is not a suspect. The victim's secret past indicates a clear motive for murder, even justification, but who was the killer?

Poirot, as expected, cracks it.

263157,4,6300216721,"When this movie came out, I had already read the Agatha Christie novel more than once. I knew it well. And as one usually does who is a fan of the books, I couldn't help being somewhat annoyed at the differences. But watching this now as a DVD, I am reminded that it really is a very good movie. It's probably better for those who have not read the book, however.

How they got so many stars into one film is beyond me. Either they had a huge budget, or some of them worked for less than their usual fees because they loved the movie. Albert Finney plays Hercule Poirot for all his annoying quirks as well as his ""little gray cells."" But Lauren Bacall, Martin Balsam, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean Pierre Cassel, Sean Connery (delicious, senior version), John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel Roberts, Richard Widmark, and Michael York (delicious, junior version) make this one of the most remarkable casts in film history.

The Calais coach (the Orient Express itself) is a beautifully restored luxury train, and the costumes are consistent with the money that was involved in this sort of trip. The plot, in spite of changes to make it fit the movie, is by Agatha Christie, after all, and so has enough twists and turns to keep the best mystery lovers happy. Suffice to say that if you have not been told, you probably will not guess the ending.",1337558400,2,1389,4.642276422764228

In it, you'll find an all-star cast headed by Albert Finney who plays the Belgian detective ""Hercule Poirot."" Although the movie was made in 1974, the time period in the film was set somewhere in the 1930s or so, and captures a glamorous feeling of yesteryear through the music and costumes.

Like most Christie stories, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS has a cast of unforgettable characters, one being despised and ends up dead. It's up to Poirot to solve the case and everyone is a suspect. I won't give away the ending, but it's a real twist, and I think the only one that ends this way in all of the author's books.

The movie's resolution is pretty good and you can see details in things like the wall paper in the background, so it's pretty good for a film that's over 30 years old.

The thing about whodunnits in hooking on the audiences is their ""what will happen next"" quality. This movie suffers from a complete lack of it. Albert Finney playing Hercule Poirot acts like a retired-clown who had to substitute the ring-master for a day in a circus where all the animals whom he has to manage know that he is a substitute-ring-master nothwithstanding his anti-gravity moustache. And the poor audience can not help but agree with the animals. I am guessing that Albert Finney did thetare before he entered movies. I have always felt that actors who have done too much of theatre, often get embroiled in stereotypical charaterisation of their portrayals on celluloid. They forget that the camera which shoots a MOVIE cathches subtility of expression with much aplomb and anything which is NOT subtle gets magnified to make it all look ludicrously THEATRICAL. Dilip Kumar (his work till the 70s) and Clint Esatwood are brilliant examples of how restrained expressions have the most spellbinding effect. This movie has so many stars and none of them have been given the chance to deliver to the best of their talent. I am amazed that this movie has had a cult following.",1320796800,,1314,4.844444444444444

263187,4,6300216721,"This film was shot in the 70s, which was a cute time for film-making -- the music either made or broke this film.  The close-up of the train light, it lights up -- ta da!!  The lilting violins as we tra la tra la through the Slovak mountains on the Orient Express.  Yowza!

Now, I have read the book and the all-star cast made the train ride worthwhile.  Can't help but make a few comparisons.  The film begins with the Daisy Armstrong child kidnapping and the tragedies that followed.  The book actually has the reader eventually discover the Armstrong case as Poirot interviews the passengers.  The film creates a foundation of the motive as a first thing.  Nothing wrong with that, but I liked the book's suspense more.

Mrs. Hubbard in the book was a dumpy, crass woman.  Lauren Bacall's Mrs. Hubbard is indeed gabby, but she has class and style (as only the ex Mrs. Bogart can!).  The stars were each given a spotlight: Ingrid Bergman as the God-fearing, tearful woman who admits to ""being born backward"".  She was so pitiful that she won an Oscar for this performance!

Sean Connery's gruffness; Vanessa Redgrave's walk; and Richard Widmark's gangster attitude (and eventual death -- not a spoiler, that's the beginning!) make for a curious walk in the park for Hercule Poirot, played in a fun but idiosyncratic style by Albert Finney, star of many an English and American film.

The Agatha Christie build-up, the suspense of the locked-door mystery was missing for me.  Several of the clues and goofs that lead to Poirot's discoveries in the book were not in the film which was a disappointment.

Entertaining, fun to see the old stars again, like visiting returning friends.

I noticed some reviewers whining about Albert Finney playing Poirot and, while I am a fan of David Suchet as Poirot, I think Finney did a great job. To say the cast is star-studded would be an understatement. Five stars for a great movie!",1280448000,,398,4.391891891891892
263190,5,6300216721,"For those of you giving only one or two stars...Good thing almost no body agrees with you.
Just watching Finney do Poirot--putting on his hairnet, mustache net, gloves & turning pages of newspaper while playing an air violin was a hoot. And Wendy Hiller, as dowager Princess Dragomiroff, was wonderful right down to her painted dark black fingernails as she offered them out to ""Bianchi"" Martin Balsam to kiss. As was the multiple duels of Poirot wit or charm or anger with train suspects...especially well-played accented parts of ""Hildegarde"" by the lesser knowns Rachel Roberts, and pivotal cabin steward ""Pierre"" by actor Jean-Pierre Cassel.

I guess if you want high action you need to go to the plethera of computer generated movies doing all the ""acting"" as old fashioned dialogue and body language and facial reactions is most of the acting done on this film. The Orient train itself is depicted fabulously and believably.  The richness of many scenes...these characters as each arrives to get on the train is unique from the frazzled Christian missionary to the overprotective Count & wife as they huddle together. But Lauren Becall's arrival is the best to watch.

Each one of the actors did a very specific and unique character piece, which is what Agatha Christie writes in her sleuthing novels.

It is extremely rare to have such a huge cast of famous actors plying their trade in a film together. It is a classic movie worth buying and keeping to view without a swear word necessary at all.",1278892800,5,1504,4.886274509803922

263223,5,6300216721,"When it comes to mystery movies I would have to rank 1974's ""Murder On the Orient Express"" right at the top of my list.  This is a magnificent film that contains just about all of the elements I look for in a mystery movie.  It goes without saying that the writing is first rate.  The film is based on Agatha Christie's 1934 novel of the same name.  ""Murder On the Orient Express"" is directed by Sidney Lumet who has been the guiding light for more than 50 feature films including such classics as ""12 Angry Men"", ""Fail Safe"",  ""Network"",  ""The Verdict"" and ""Serpico"" to name but a few.  Add to the mix an all-star cast including such legendary performers as Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Martin Balsam and Anthony Perkins and you would seem to have all the ingredients in place for a first rate motion picture.  In my view ""Murder On the Orient Express"" completely lives up to those lofty expectations.

Clearly the star of this production is Albert Finney who plays one of Agatha Christie's most famous and long-lived charactors,  the fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.  Poirot just happens to be a passenger on the Orient Express when a gruesome murder takes place in the wee small hours of the morning.  The victim was a gentlemen who called himself Ratchett.  The previous evening Ratchett had attempted to engage Poirot as a personal bodyguard because he had been receiving threatening letters and feared for his life.  Poirot turned down that job but would be persuaded to conduct an investigation of the brutal crime right there on the the train.  Poirot would quickly discover that Mr. Ratchett was none other than a gangster named Carlo Cassetti who had allegedly masterminded the murder of Daisy Armstrong some years earlier.  Daisy was the the baby daughter of a wealthy British Army Colonel who had settled in the U.S. with his American-born wife.  This sensational case was headline news all over the world at the time.  Poirot would also discover that 12 of the passengers on the Orient Express had some connection to the Armstrong case.  After interviewing all 12 of these passengers and sifting through all of the available evidence Poirot would come to a startling conclusion.

""Murder On the Orient Express"" proves that a great movie need not be filled with blood, gore and violence to be entertaining.  I wish there were more films like it.  I recently purchased the DVD and viewed this film for the first time in a good long while.  I found it just as entertaining this time as I did when I first saw it in the theater back in 1974.  Very highly recommended!",1260921600,3,2667,4.785557986870897

I feel Albert Finney does a fine job of more closely representing the character of Poirot. Though if you are a fan of Peter Ustinov as Poirot you may not like this movie at all. There are some big names in here for the time when the movie was made though I doubt most people today will know who half of them are. There are two actors in this story that also appear in a later Agatha Christie Movie (Evil Under the Sun). And there is also a young Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates from Pyscho). It is a fairly long movie when it was released on VHS it actually came on two tapes. The movie has a richness to it that seems to capture what we believe or want to believe that time period was like. Honestly at the price you not taking a loss, I hope you enjoy.",1258848000,2,1023,4.069306930693069
263225,3,6300216721,"I'd heard about this movie and had great expectations but was sadly disappointed in the performance by Albert Finney.  With Poirot movies, he explains the murder at the end and so his spoken words are vital to the film.  Albert Finney's voice modulation (with a profound American 'accent') was extremely difficult and mostly impossible to understand. Oddly, he did not even attempt a French or European accent, but only relied on changing the modulation of his voice - it was very odd and disappointing.
Also strange was his hair which looked as if a bottle of oil had been poured over it and then combed in - the result was a very odd look indeed.

The rest of the cast were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of the cast of famous movie stars as well as the photography.  I've given the movie 3 stars for these attributes.  But over all, it was a disappointment.  I'm looking forward to Murder on the Orient Express with Poirot portrayed by David Suchet.

[Would those peddlers be allowed in the train station?] The train travels through the countryside while the people dine and converse. Mr. Ratchet has been threatened, he asked Hercule Poirot to take a job. The train halts because snow blocks the railway. The morning finds Mr. Ratchet dead, stabbed a dozen times. Poirot will investigate. ""The murderer is with us now.""

Poirot deduces the true identity of Ratchet. He then interviews the other travelers. [What do we learn?] What will they find in a suitcase? What secrets will be revealed? Finally the travelers are gathered in the dining car so Poirot can solve the murder. Is there a complex answer? Poirot begins by explaining the answers of the travelers. Then he reconstructs the murder and provides a solution. Believable? [Only in a fictional world is such a complex plan possible.] The rescue train arrives so the stalled trains continues on its journey. Was justice served by this ending?

The only things that kept me from turning this movie off in the beginning were the costumes and the sets.  This movie is a period piece set in the 1930's.  The train ride was first class all the way.

The opening scene where you see the kidnapping taking place still spooks me. Sometimes I even fast forward through it a little, just because the music creeps me out. I think the cast of this movie is brilliant. Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, etc. All Hollywood legends. I particularly like Vanessa Redgrave in this. She was so good at being evasive and batting her eyes at the same time. Like in the scene where Poirot is getting frustrated with her and begins yelling, I almost want to slap her. She's that good. Everyone is just fantastic in this. I really like the story itself too. Revenge, yet for a noble reason. I won't say anymore than that, though. The ending where the murder is explained is chilling.

263269,5,6300216721,"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is an impressive movie.  Well-acted, beautifully shot and lit, and with a sharp tongued script and stunning sets, it is a masterpiece, much like the genius book by Agatha Christie is considered today.

The story follows detective Hercule Poirot (a heavily accented Albert Finney) as he has to solve the murder of Mr. Ratchett (Richard Widmark) on the infamous Orient Express.  Among the suspects are: loquacious Mrs. Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), Bible-toting Swede Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman), Colonel Arbuthnot (Sean Connery), his lover Miss Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), and conductor Pierre Michel (Jean-Pierre Michel).  Along for the ride are a Dr. Constantine and Poirot's old friend Bianchi (Marin Balsam).  Each of the 12 passengers has secrets and lies, but the big question is: whodunit?

The best thing about the film is the look.  The train itself is created wonderfully and realistically, and the sets of the cars are simply gorgeous.  And if this film didn't win an Oscar for cinematography, it very well should have.  This film is shot in, back then, an unconventional manner including now common swing-shots, rotating cameras, and several flashback scenes that look unique every time, due to different lighting and angles.  The lighting, likewise, is inspired, and while I don't usually pay attention to things like that when I see a move, this time I couldn't help but noticing.  In addition, the score by Richard Rodney Bennett is lush and memorable.

The actors do a great job.  Finney can be hard to understand, but Lauren Bacall is my favorite as the chatter-mouthed, annoying American Hubbard.  Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for her role, and though she is good, she obviously didn't deserve it, as she's only in 2 or 3 scenes and is hardly Oscar-worthy in them.  I also enjoyed Redgrave as Debenham, Cassel as the French conductor, and Widmark in his brief role as the murdered Mr. Ratchett who is, like all else, more than he seems.

The movie is great.  It could have benefitted from a faster pace, but that's about all I have against it.  It's memorable and intriguing even today, more than 30 years after it was made.",1220486400,,2168,4.975

The best parts of the film are in its opening half-hour, when they gather aboard the train in Istanbul and get ready for departure: once the train gets snowbound and the big murder occurs, the enclosed space seems not a little claustrophobic as Hercule Poirot (Finney, in disfiguring make-up) rounds up and interviews the suspects.

The film is immeasurably helped by its famous score by Richard Rodney Bennett and by its brilliantly disturbing pre-title sequence explaining the sensational kidnapping and murder of a wealthy Scottish colonel's daughter that predetermines all the film's later events, and which all by itself is genuinely one of the greatest sequences in Seventies film.

263365,5,6300216721,"In the early 1960s Agatha Christie (1890-1976) sold the film rights to several of her most celebrated novels--and although the public liked the ensuing films, she herself did not.  She was forever after suspicious of the film industry and rejected one offer after another until the early 1970s, when Lord Louis Mountbatten interceded on behalf of son-in-law and film producer John Brabourne for the film rights to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.  Christie reluctantly agreed.  In 1974, upon seeing the film, she declared it to be the ONLY film version of any of her novels that she liked.

The story is famous.  Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is a celebrated private investigator traveling via the legendary Orient Express.  The train is snowbound in the Balkans--and Mr. Rachett (Richard Widmark) is found brutally stabbed in the bed of his luxury room.  At the request of Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), an official of the train, Poriot agrees to investigate the murder... but the more he learns from the numerous passengers, the more impossible the crime seems.

Even today, most film versions of Christie novels are played with a bit of a twinkle in the eye, as if to say ""this is all just in good fun.""  Not so MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.  The all star cast includes John Gilegud, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, and Rachel Roberts, to name but the most obvious, and they play out the story with tremendous style but without the self-knowing cuteness that tends to undercut most similar films.  The novel is among the more convoluted Christie works, but the Paul Dehn manages to encapsulate it without simplifying it.  And then there is the look and sound and feel of the movie, which is simply amazing.

The Orient Express had passed into legend by 1974, but this film returns the celebrated luxury train to sparkling reality.  From costumes to art design, from cinematography to score, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is so richly detailed that it becomes an almost tactile experience.  This is truly an example of ""no expense spared.""  The film was nominated for no fewer than six Academy Awards, winning one for Ingrid Bergman, and was also nominated for no fewer than seventeen awards from other groups, winning at least six.  All in all, it was one of the most celebrated films of its era.

For many years MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was only available in mediocre VHS and DVD transfers, but this particular edition not only returns the film to a near-pristine state, it includes several memorable bonuses as well, most especially a ""making of"" documentary that includes many of the cast members; a short documentary on Agatha Christie; and a short documentary on the Lindberg kidnapping, which was among Christie's inspirations for the novel.  Slick, beautiful, and seductive, the 1974 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS sets a standard for mystery movies that few have equaled--and none have surpassed.  Strongly recommended.

Classic murder mystery, this movie is so entertaining.

An all-star cast, this movie has many lovely faces, multi-cultural humor, and will make you laugh and laugh.

Interesting performance by Ingrid Bergman.  She did a fine performance in her part - it's not what she usually would play.  She is often the leading role, this time she played a dowdy, Swedish woman, and did a very believable job.

In later Christie movies, Peter Ustinov is fine as Poirot, but it is Finney that really defines him. The setting on the train, the cozy feel of the train as it makes its way thru the Asian and European terrain, and then the stark reality of the train's isolation due to the blizzard just as murder is discovered. There is no weakness in the acting, no weakness in the set, no weakness in the screen play, and certainly no weakness in the novel on which this is based.

263433,4,6300216721,"Murder on the Orient Express is a detective story that I think is based on a book by Agatha Christie. Well, it's clear from watching it that it's source material came from a book; Because it's got that classic detective story set up. Instead of a detective trying to solve a mystery and then a (what the writers think is a) big twist at the end. In this story, the detective does spend the whole movie trying to figure out what is going on...But instead of the twist, we have him with all the accused going over his interrogations and reveaaling who he believes is the culprit(s). This film is directed by Sidney Lumet, the director of such films as 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'Serpico,' 'Network,'and 'Find Me Guilty.' I think out of those films, this is his weakest...But it doesn't go without being enjoyed. Albert Finney (with a wonderfully weird moustache) plays a Belgian detective named Hercule Poirot, who is boarding the Orient Express...Much to the dismay of the suspicious looking passengers. During the beginning of his trip, he is stopped by a man named Ratchett (Richard Widmark) who asks him to serve as a bodyguard for him. He's obviously desperate for one, for he offers 15,000 dollars. Poirot turns him down and then heads off to sleep. When he wakes up, Ratchett has been murdered...Poisoned and stabbed and it's Poirot's job to interrogate the passengers of the Orient Express. The very colorful suspects include Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman (in an Oscar winning performance), Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Conney, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates, no less), Jean-Pierre Cassell, Vanessa Redgrave, and many others.

The film is like a stage play, in the story takes place aboard the train and is mostly straight-forward story-telling. There's only a few flashback sequences. It's entertaining though, although the outcome isn't incredibly surprising. The film is funny; Connery's ""pipe"" was worth watching. The film is no masterpiece, neither in general film or for it's genre...But it's a cool detective story and you really can't beat the cast. Finney gives one of his most over-the-top and best performances. Remember, pay close attention to the opening credits (which show newspaper adds about a kidnapped girl). Needless to say, it evolves into a pretty big plot point. Enjoy.

 Ingrid Bergman is good as Greta Olsson and claimed that she was originally offered the Wendy Hiller-role, but wanted to be Swedish(She was of course, with a German mother who died when Ingrid was two years old. Her father died when she was 12 and being a photographer, filmed her at all times. But times damaged the negative and her heritage was thought lost forever. It was only when she came to Hollywood that her boss David O. Selznick restored the footage and she was able to see her mother Friedel on film for the first time).

Lauren Bacall is to my mind - the standout here - in a drama borrowed from the tragic Lindbergh-kidnapping case in 1932.",1142380800,,821,4.423841059602649
263439,5,6300216721,"This was a great book, and an even greater movie. A stellar cast came out for this one, including Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Berman, Michael York and many others. Albert Finney plays Hercule Poirot, the obsessively clean Belgian detective who pre-dates Adrian Monk as an incredibly intelligent but quirky detective.

Right away it's clear that this storyline is based on the Lindbergh kidnapping. The child of a rich couple is stolen and then slain. Only a short while into the train ride, a man is slain - and it's the main accused of having killed that child. Poirot immediately sees the connection and starts questioning all of the riders, one by one, while the train is stopped by a snowdrift.

The sets and plotting are brilliant. You really get the sense that the occupants are all part of a ""well decorated, lavish prison"". The rooms are tiny. The people are all jammed together. There isn't any privacy or room to think. The personalities chafe against each other.

Each actor and actress is given their special time on the screen. The interviews are done one by one, giving each personality a chance to develop and shine. I have to say that Finney isn't my favorite actor in the set - I find his interpretation of Poirot a little ""reedy"" and as if he is hobbling around at times. I accept that each actor that has played this character has his own interpretation of it. That's normal. I just personally like another actor's interpretation better.

I love how the movie takes the time to poke fun at its own genre. One character keeps saying ""HE did it!"" with each new discussion. He even says ""The Butler Did It!"" at one point. I love the glass-clinking sequence at the end.

As much as I adore this movie, I do have to point out a few tiny problems. SPOILERS ALERT!!

Surely, if these people all plotted the death of this man, they would have known it would be VERY obvious to police that they all had a common tie. This wasn't a vagrant that was slain, it was a rich, wealthy man. His death would have been seriously investigated. Surely a great alibi would have been arranged for the situation. Instead they all claim they didn't know him at all. This would have been spotted as a lie almost immediately.

I love rewatching this movie even though I know who-done-it - it's just great fun to experience.",1141516800,2,2323,4.596618357487923
263440,5,6300216721,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1974. I was at the height of my Agatha Christie fanaticism, having discovered her in seventh grade (1972). By 1978, I'd read all of her books.  My aunts took me to see ""Orient Express"" at the theater for my 14th birthday and gave me an Orient Express key ring (which I still use to this day, 32 years later!)

This year a friend, who knew nothing about my secret Agatha Christie past, gave me a copy of the DVD for my 46th birthday. I hadn't seen it at all in the intervening years.  And, lo, it held up to my memory of it.  The cast is superb, the cinematography beautiful, the story-telling excellent.  Of course, it seemed to me like the movie practically screamed ""whodunit"" from almost the first moments on the train, but then again, I already knew. Still that didn't detract from the fun, in fact, it added to it.

Rent this film for a fun evening. It's really the best of the Christie films I've ever seen.

263441,5,6300216721,"Murder on the Orient Express is the best murder mystery ever!  You have all the clues but most people will not put them together!

The film starts with newspaper articles about a kidnapping.  The film advances five years later to the Asian side of Istanbul.  One by one all the characters are introduced.  On the ferry we meet Poirot (Albert Finney), a British secretary Miss Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), her boyfriend Colonel Arbuthnot (Sean Connery).  That night at the hotel we meet an old friend of Poirot's Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the train line.  The remaining cast we meet boarding the train. First is the Princess Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller) and her lady's maid Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachael Roberts).  Next on board are Count and Contess Andrenyi (Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset), followed by the famous American stage actress Mrs. Harriet Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), Swedish missionary Greta Swenson (Ingrid Bergman), Ratchett (Richard Widmark), his private secretary Hector McQueen (Anthony Perkins) and butler Beddoes (John Gielguld).  Each is greeted by the conductor Pierre Paul Michel (Jean Pierre Casal).  On board we meet the last two travelers a Pinkerton agent Cyrus Hardman (Colin Blakely) and a car salesman Gino Foscarelli (Dennis Quilley).

Ratchett tries to hire Poirot because he feels his life is in danger.  He has gotten two threatening notes ""I Kill Killers"" and ""Prepare to Die"".  The next morning he is found dead with twelve stab wounds.  There is a third note with the name Daisy Armstrong on it.  Daisy was the name of the child kidnapped and killed at the beginning.

Bianchi asks Poirot to solve the murder.  And reluctantly, he agrees.  He one by one interviews all the passengers.  At the end he gathers the passengers and reenacts his murder scenario and then presents a simpler solution and leaves the choice to Bianchi.

I won't detail the movie as the twist and turns are better if you don't know them.  All I tell you is listen carefully.  Now some of the conclusions are faulty by today's standards but the overall conclusion is brilliant.  Raves to Dame Christie.

This is a brilliant adaptation by Paul Dehn (he should have won the Oscar) and a great change of pace for Sidney Lumet.  The cast is uniformly superb starting with Albert Finney.  While I think David Suchet is the best Poirot - as he has done most of the books and stories, Finney was perfection in the role and I'm really sorry he did not want to reprise the role.  As for the suspects, Bergman deserved her Oscar and Lauren Bacall was great in her first great role in a very long time.

As for technically, this film deserved more accolades.  Tony Walton's production design and set design were spot on.  No detail was lacking.

This is a near perfect murder mystery film.

Director Sidney Lumet's lavish film adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery is a fascinating entertainment thanks to a clever script, outstanding cinematography, a lush musical score, breathtaking costumes, eye-popping editing, and above all else, the delicious performances of a once-in-a-lifetime all-star cast.  Although die-hard fans of Christie's celebrated fictional detective Hercule Poirot may take issue with leading man Albert Finney's liberal characterization, Finney does in fact perform a highly demanding and technically difficult role with verve and conviction.  His minor tour de force is supported ably by such celebrated stars of stage and screen as Anthony Perkins (eerily channeling the spirit of Norman Bates); the brash and bawdy Lauren Bacall; John Gielgud at his haughty and condescending best; a radiant Vanessa Redgrave; Wendy Hiller as a mummified Russian Princess; a temper-prone Sean Connery; and many others, each of whom is given their special chance to shine.  Ingrid Bergman won the Supporting Oscar for her performance as a mousy, religiously obsessed missionary in this film; but truly, every member of the cast performs at the same high caliber as she.

The DVD presentation of this film is acceptable overall, although there are some minor visual glitches and artifacts during the opening credit sequence that tend to make one leery until the action begins to unfold.  The Original Theatrical Trailer has deteriorated badly, but is still a welcome inclusion to the Special Features section. The DVD extras also include a short feature on author Christie; and four new mini-documentaries on the making of the film, featuring recent interviews with director Lumet and surviving cast members such as Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset and Michael York.

Perhaps the true test of a great screen mystery involves the question of whether or not, once the film has been viewed and the solution is no longer a potential surprise, the movie is worth watching again for a second or third time or more.  ""Murder on the Orient Express"", because of its impeccable production values and the consummate skill with which it was acted and filmed, is just such a movie.",1116115200,7,2235,5.3418803418803416

1. Albert Finney (Hercule Poirot) - Excellent excellent performance.  You can't tell it's Albert Finney, and I think he wanted it this way.  And he loses himself in the part.  Just a great great job.

2. Ingrid Bergman (Greta Ohlsson) - She is arguably the best actress of all time.  The only other actress (that I see) who comes close (and perhaps surpasses her) is Meryl Streep.  Small part here for her, but she makes the best of it.  The interrogation scene, a 7 or 8 minute effort that was made in a single cut, won her the academy award.  And for those who can see it, her efforts include a healthy dosage of female wiles.  Few performers wanted the audience's attention more desperately than Ingrid, and she uses all the tools at her disposal here ... and it won her the Oscar.

3. Martin Balsam (Signor Bianchi) - Great job as the Orient Express stockholder.  Perhaps the pressure was off Martin because of the fire-power around him, because he gives us a solid, believable, and likable characterization.

4. Jean-Pierre Cassel (French Conductor) - Great performance here ... especially after we learn the facts of the case.  A foreigner in a star-studded American cast, he more than stands his ground ... with a subtle and effective style of acting.

5. Wendy Hiller (Princess Dragomiroff) - Great job ... delightful in her delivery and most believable as the aging princess.

6. Sir John Gielgud (Mr. Beddoes) - This was a perfect fit for John Gielgud - a prim and proper butler with a wry sense of humor - and he does a spledid job with it.

7. Jacqueline Bissett (Countess Andrenyi) - A top Hollywood beauty at that time, Jacqueline shows that she is more than just a pretty face.  She hangs in there throughout the entire picture (among her more celebrated co-workers) and stands fairly tall (among them) when it is all over.

8. Vanessa Redgrave (Mary Debeuham) - Not a big serious role for Vanessa, and she seems to enjoy herself on the set ... giving a light flirty performance ... as was perhaps expected of her.

9. Rachel Roberts (Hildegarde) - Good solid effort here by Rachel ... an effective convincing job as Wendy Hiller's maid.

10. Sean Connery (Colonel Arbuthuot) - Sean Connery has this ""greater than thou"" attitude that he carries into all his pictures ... and a lot of people buy into it ... but just looking at his acting ability, it's not that great.  Not terrible, but definately not as good as he thinks it is.

11. Denis Quilley (Antonio Foscarelli) - Good job, believable characterization as the Italian chauffeur.  Funny too.

12. Anthony Perkins (Hector MacQueen) - This is an up and down performance in a role that plays (or should play) right into Anthony Perkins' specialty.

13. Richard Widmark (Cassetti) - This role is a small one, but is very important because it is the bad guy ... a truly sinister evil person.  And Richard Widmark does not do a convincing job.  It is almost as if he does little more than recite his lines.

14. Lauren Bacall (Mrs. Hubbard) - A terrible and annoying performance.  While most everyone around her is giving a well studied performance, Lauren breezes through the picture with a loud voice and little or no effort exerted.  Ann Bancroft would have been a better choice for this part.

15. Michael York (Count Andrenyi) - Not a terrible job ... maybe a bit too much push on the sophistication and aristocracy.

16. Colin Blakely (Mr. Hardman) - very small role, he gets squeezed out by the fire power around him, does OK with it though.

That's it.  Like I said, a great movie ... one that holds up well under repeated viewing.",1105660800,3,3926,4.619942196531792

The night before the train gets stuck in the snow, a man is murdered on the luxurious train.  The murder leads to several questions that Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) has to face as he becomes the lead investigator.  The major question is who onboard the train murdered the man and why?

Sidney Lumet adapts the famous book by Christie with a dozen skilled cinematic stars including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, and Anthony Hopkins to name a few.  The infamous starlet Ingrid Bergman received an Oscar for the part of a Swedish missionary in the film.  Lumet creates a thick atmosphere with dubious intrigue through experienced directing of the cast, sublime mise-en-scene, and skillful cinematography.

263509,5,6300216721,"Agatha Christie's mysteries changed the genre. With twists, turns and credible watertight plotting her novels divorced themselves from the hackneyed conventions of the genre. Sidney Lumet's superb film of Christie's novel looks marvelous on this deluxe DVD from Paramount. The rich, colorful cinematographer of Geoffrey Unsworth (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") looks terrific. Lumet's assured hand guides the film without hesitation to a truly stunning conclusion. Paramount has remastered the soundtrack for Dolby Digital 5.1 giving the sound a richer feel than previous video editions of the movie. While it doesn't quite convey the detail one might hear in a brand new movie, it does a great job of improving an already great mystery movie.

After working on a case, Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) travels home on the Orient Express hoping for a relaxing journey. Instead, when the train is caught in the show he's drawn into a mystery on the very train he's traveling on. A millionaire named Ratchett (Richard Widmark) has been brutally murdered. Who could the murderer be and what was his or her motive? Poirot must work this out and discover which of the train's passengers committed the crime. He discovers an unusual link between the millionaire and many of the passengers on the train. Is this the vital link that will help him solve the crime?

Featuring a stellar all cast of Hollywood and London stage and screen veterans, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" chugs along on the charm of the performers, a solid script by Paul Dehn (""The Spy Who Came in the Cold"", ""Goldfinger"", ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"") and outstanding direction by  Sidney Lumet (""The Verdict"", ""Deathtrap"", ""Network"", ""Prince of the City""). The casting is a bit unusual. While Albert Finney probably wouldn't be most fan's first choice for Poirot, he gives a marvelous performance as Agatha Christie's detective. I've read reviews criticizng Finney's performance and, while he may not be the ""ideal"" Poirot his interpretation is unique and works perfectly for this film.

I'm pleasantly surprised that Paramount has sprung for all the extras here. We get a documentary that can be viewed all at once or by segments. The documentary features interviews with Sidney Lumet, producers John Brabourne, Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset, Michael York,  Richard Goodwin, writer-director Nicholas Meyer (""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"", The Seven Percent Solution) and the grandson of Agatha Christie discussing the hard road to producing the film. Evidently, Christie reluctantly agreed to give the rights to the film to the producers at first but was won over when she found out that producer Brabourne had worked on ""Tales of Beatrix Potter"". Lumet comments on the difficulty in having Finney play Poirot as he was too young for the role (Alec Guinness and Paul Scofield were Lumet's first and second choices). The marvels of make up helped sell Finney in the role and the fact that he played against audience expectations worked for him in the role. Lumet recounts a funny story where the cast got together to read the script together the first time couldn't hear the cast. Why? Because the stage actors were in awe of the theater actors and vice versa. Lumet's challenge was honing an acting style that was consistent between all the very different performers. ""Murder"" is one of those few mysteries that live up to its potential despite considerable odds against it doing so. It's clear that the cast respect and love Lumet-how else to explain Connery, Bisset and York agreeing to appear in a documentary on the making of the film for the DVD? There's also a discussion of the real life inspiration for part of the story-the Lindbergh kidnapping. Another marvelous documentary by the talented Laurent Bouzereau, his work has become the standard against which all other writer/producer/directors of extras on DVDs should be measured. His work here as on ""Duel"", ""E.T."" and other DVDs continues the tradition of digging up the past to enlighten those of us who couldn't possibly have been there.

""Agatha Christie: A Portrait"" gives us insight into the mysterious life of the elusive novelist. We're also told almost as much about her most famous creation Poirot who appears almost as elusive as the novelist herself. This eight minute featurette puts a human face on a remarkable mystery novelist who helped reinvent the genre. We also get the original theatrical trailer which demonstrates how much work went into restoring and transferring this beautifully shot film. Smudged with loads of analog blemishes, the comparison between the trailer and the film indicates the great work that went into improving this film for DVD. There's no commentary track but Lumet's insightful observations in the documentary more than make up for the lack of such a track.

 Beautifully restored with enhanced sound, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" probably didn't look this good when it showed in theaters in 1974. The outstanding international cast of screen and stage veterans along with Dehn's sharp adaptation and Lumet's assured direction makes ""Murder"" one of the best films made from one of Christie's convoluted mystery novels. It's a joy to watch.",1095206400,175,5216,5.121034077555817

263511,5,6300216721,"Sidney Lumet's 1974 film version of Dame Agatha Christie's famous 'whodunnit' ""Murder On The Orient Express"" is a cinematic excercise in class.  I'm not talking about class in the sense of social status (although class in that sense is definetly a major part of the films characterizations) but 'class' as denoting something of high quality and prestige. From its all star cast down to its exquisite production values MOTOE positively drips class.

Made at a time when class was mostly lacking from much of pop culture and there existed a huge demand for nostalgia MOTOE really struck a chord with 70's movie audiences and became a huge hit.  Sadly, today's audiences may have a hard time appreciating this film as nothing more than a quaint curiosity.  A mere ensemble piece of cinematic fluff.  I can agree to some extent with that argument but I also happen to feel that this film has much more to offer.  Mainly as an object lesson in quality film making.

From a logistical and technical aspect this film could have quite easily, if you'll pardon the pun, become tragically derailed.  Just think about it.  A two hour plus film with out any car chases, shoot outs or huge explosions and consisting of a huge cast who do nothing but talk to one another while trapped within the confines of a snowbound train for the films duration could quite easily have become a tedious bore. Better yet, try and imagine a film like that even getting made today.  Why you'd get thrown out of every studio you broached the idea to.

So why does this film work?  The answer is craftsmanship and talent.  Paul Dehn's smart screenplay is lean and taut with lots of great dialogue.  The actors are all hugely talented and never seem to be trying to out do one another.  Sidney Lumet's direction is sure handed and keeps all the action flowing at a reasonable pace.  The costume designs and art direction are lavish and the music score is marvellous.  Sum total: a finely crafted film that succeeds admirably as grand entertainment. The film works because the people who made it actually cared about what they were doing and were also very talented.  Sounds simple doesen't it?  Yeah, well, let me just say that before I shell out any more money for another ""Van Helsing"" I'll just stay at home and watch ""Murder On The Orient Express"".  A lot of the cinematic eye candy I've seen recently can't hold a candle to this film.

You'll hear lots of people complaining about about Albert Finney's portrayal of Hercule Poirot and will go on and on about how David Suchet is better.  I happen to think that both men offer fine interpretations of Christie's famous little Belgian detective.  Both are equally valid.  As to which is better is just a matter of taste.  Try not to let it spoil your enjoyment of this fine film

As to the DVD: the film could use some restoration (I'm not gonna hold my breath for one) but this transfer is nice and easy on the eye.  There is a very nice 'Making Of' feature that runs for at least 45 minutes and frankly I was quite suprised to see that Paramount took the time to do something like this for MOTOE.  Also included is an interview with Dame Agatha's grandson and a film trailer.  All in all this is a very fine DVD for the price.",1094601600,4,3248,4.570934256055363

I watched this movie without reading the 1934 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it is based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

As a brief synopsis, the murder by multiple stab wounds of a wealthy businessman named Mr. Ratchett (Richard Widmark) takes place on the famous train, the Orient Express (that travels from Istanbul to Paris).  On the train, thanks to his good friend and director of this railway line Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), is non-other than the super-sleuth himself, Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney).

Who are the passengers (besides the three above) on this train?  They are as follows:

1. Socialite Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard (Lauren Bacall)

2. Missionary Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman)

3. Colonel Arbuthnot (Sean Connery)

4. Mr. Beddoes, butler to Ratchett (Sir John Gielgud)

5. Hector MacQueen, secretary to Ratchett (Anthony Perkins)

6. Russian Princess Dragomiroff (Dame Wendy Hiller)

7. Hildegarde Schmitt, Maid to Dragomiroff (Rachel Roberts)

8. Teacher and Arbuthnot's lover Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave)

9. Countess Andrenyi (Jaqueline Bisset)

10. Count Andrenyi (Michael York)

11. Conductor of the train, Pierre Paul Michel (Jean Paul Cassel)

12. Undercover Pinkerton Detective Hardman (Colin Blakely)

13. Car Salesman Foscarelli (Denis Quilley)

14. Dr. Constantine (George Coulouris)

Of the above actors, I feel that Bacall, Connery, Hiller, Roberts, and Cassel did superb jobs in their roles.  This was Connery's fifth movie role after he finished his last 007 movie.  Bergman won an Oscar for her brief acting role in this movie.

This movie is filled with witty dialogue.  One of my favorites is spoken by Poirot: ""Only by interrogating the other passengers could I hope to see the light, but when I began to question them, the light, as Macbeth would have said, thickened.""

I enjoyed the end of this movie.  There are two scenarios that Poirot deduces of how the murder was possibly committed.  He terms these the ""simple"" solution and the ""more complex"" solution.

This movie has a moody period-piece atmosphere.  Except for the first half hour, all the action takes place on the train and we get plenty of interior shots of the train.  (Real Orient Express cars were used.)  All costumes are authentic looking.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.

The lush feel of this movie (filmed on location in Turkey and France) is captured by the rich photography and its good transfer onto DVD.  It's not perfect, but the pictures are clear and don't have any major flaws.

There are only three DVD extras:

(1) biography of Agatha Christie

(2) four-part series on the making of this movie

(3) theatrical trailer.

I enjoyed the four-part series on the making of this movie.

Considering the cast involved in this movie you might have thought that there must be some good behind-the-scenes information to be included with these extras.  Unfortunately, there wasn't.

Finally, the major problem I had with this movie is Finney's portrayal of Poirot.  Poirot is portrayed as being cranky and somewhat rude.  He yells and gets angry at points in the movie.  Also, Finney gives Poirot a heavy accent that comes across as garbled.  I thus found Poirot difficult to understand at times.  (I got around this by using the closed-captioning.)  For those who have seen Sir Peter Ustinov's or especially David Suchet's portrayal of the Belgian sleuth, they will find Finney's performance quite a deviation from what they expect.

In conclusion, this mystery movie is a dialogue-driven movie.  It's a perfect escape from those over-the-top action movies and gives the viewer a good brain workout.  As well, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

263513,5,6300216721,"To me the definitive Hercule Poirot will always be Peter Ustinov, but in 1974 Albert Finney tackled the role in this excellent adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel of the same name and the movie continues to this day as one of my very favorite whodunnit's - thank goodness it is finally making its way to DVD.
  Starring a cast that is simply incredible this movie set the standard for the Ustinov star studded movies that would follow (starting with 1978's DEATH ON THE NILE). Included on the list of stars are such names as Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset, Sir John Gielgud, Richard Widmark, Vanessa Redgrave, Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Perkins.
  Aboard the Orient Express a businessman (played by Widmark) with a mysterious past is murdered in the middle of the night. Desperate to resolve the matter before they arrive at the next major stop on the line (to avoid a lengthy police investigation) Hercule Poirot is persuaded by an executive for the train company to begin his own investigation. An avalanche over the line gives Poirot plenty of time to interview all the passengers and make his conclusions as to the guilty party (or parties).
  When Finney's Poirot faces off with the fellow passengers and describes his account of how the murder was committed and by whom you will be amazed - astounded. It's this very element and the star power of this movie that carries this intriguing mystery far above the standard whodunnit fare.
  The movie is well plotted, the acting beyond reproach and the direction steady and inspired.

263546,5,6300216721,"Thirty years ago in 1974, Sidney Lumet (who is known for directing ""Network"" in 1976, ""Serpico"" in 1973 and ""Death Trap"" in 1982) directed a murder-mystery film based upon the 1934 novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (a.k.a. ""Murder in the Calais Coach"").  The novel was written by the famous murder-mystery author Agatha Christie (1890-1976) and was the ninth book in the series that featured her famous fictional detective named Hercule Poirot.  The Orient Express began service in 1883 as a passenger rail service between Paris and Venice.  An additional southern route (known as the Simplon Orient Express) was started in 1919 that ran from Paris to Istanbul that also passed through Venice.  It is upon the Simplon Orient Express that Agatha Christie placed the location for her novel.
The 1974 film adaptation included an all-star cast, including the famous actor Albert Finney who played Hercule Poirot, for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  (Albert Finney has been nominated 4 times by the Academy for Best Actor and once for Best Supporing Actor, which was for his role as Ed Masry in the 2000 film ""Erin Brockovich"".)  Poirot boards the Orient Express on his journey home after solving a murder case.  On the train, in the sleeper cabin next to his is the millionaire businessman Mr. Ratchett (Richard Widmark), who is accompanied on the train by his secretary, Hector MacQueen (Anthony Perkins, 1932-1992), and his butler, Mr. Beddoes (Sir John Gielgud, 1904-2000).  Other passengers on the train include the Countess Andrenyi (Jacqueline Bisset), Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman, 1915-1982), Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), Colonel Arbuthnot (Sean Connery), Princess Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller, 1912-2003), Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), Hildegarde (Rachel Roberts, 1927-1980), Count Andrenyi (Michael York), Mr. Hardman (Colin Blakely, 1930-1987) and Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam, 1914-1996).  The conductor was Pierre Paul Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel).  One night with the train en route, Mr. Ratchett was murdered.  When Poirot learns this, he begins an immediate investigation in the hopes of finding the murderer before the train reaches its next scheduled stop.  As Poirot questions the passengers, he is amazed that many of them may share something in common from many years earlier.  Tension on board mounts when the train becomes trapped following an avalanche covering the tracks ahead of it.  Before the tracks can be cleared, can Poirot solve this very mysterious murder on board the Orient Express?  You'll have to watch this very well made film to understand the mystery.
In addition to Albert Finney's Oscar nomination for Best Actor, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" received four other nominations including Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Ingrid Bergman won her nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Overall, I rate this outstanding film with 5 out of 5 stars.  It is a tribute to the great mystery and literary skills that Agatha Christie shared with the world in her many novels.

263547,4,6300216721,"One of Agatha Christie's most famous mysteries was adapted to the big screen in 1974, two years before the author died.  Murder On The Orient Express was the first in a brief series of cinematic and TV movie Christie adaptations continuing with Death on The Nile, Evil Under The Sun, Easy To Kill, A Caribbean Mystery, The Mirror Crack'd, and Appointment With Death.
Mr. Ratchett, an American businessman, tries to employ Poirot after he has been getting threatening letters.  Poirot turns him down, and the following morning, he is found dead in bed from multiple stab wounds.  Clearly, it was someone on the coach, but who?  And before the murder, there was a lot of weird activity going on.  Someone wearing a fancy nightgown knocks on Poirot's door.  Ms. Hubbard calls the wagon-lit conductor and reports a man in her room.
There then follows the usual Poirot method of questioning the suspects one by one, sifting out lies and clues, of which he notices there are too many, after speaking to them.  Poirot discovers that Ratchett was the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a young girl who was ransomed and murdered despite the money being paid.  But Daisy was not the only casualty.  A maid was falsely blamed in collusion and committed suicide.  Ms. Armstrong gave birth to a stillborn child and died later, and Colonel Armstrong ended up shooting himself.
One of the key motifs of Christie mysteries and others was the use of flashbacks to accompany testimony of the people being interrogated, as well as the denouement, where in tried and true Christie fashion, Poirot gathers everyone in the room and tells them who did it, with scenes of what actually happened, something used in the later movie adaptations.
Murder On The Orient Express boasts an all-star cast of the top draws at the time, Sean Connery (Colonel Arbuthnot), Vanessa Redgrave (Miss Debenheim), Jacqueline Bisset (Countess Andrenyi), and Anthony Perkins (Hector McQueen), as well as some old veterans such as Dame Wendy Hiller (Countess Dragomiroff), Martin Balsam (Mr. Bianchi), Richard Widmark (Ratchett), and George Coulouris (Doctor Constantine).  Despite being more svelte than the character to the novel, Lauren Bacall is the strongest actress as Harriet Hubbard, and one who exasperates Poirot and the other passengers with her aggressive bossiness, although her character's name was Caroline Martha Hubbard in the novel.  Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar, albeit for Best Supporting Actress as the simple-minded Greta Ohlson.
Some changes made in the movie is John Gielgud as the elderly and masterfully unflappable valet Biddoes.  In the novel, it was Edward Masterman, who was 39 years old!  And originally, Mr. Bianchi was a Monsieur Bouc, a fellow Belgian friend of Poirot.  And the second set of interviews with the suspects is deleted from the movie.  Other than that, I was surprised that the movie more of less followed the book.
There is a splashy elegance to the whole thing.  The music veers from the sumptuous glamorous orchestra to the eerie horror sounds given in the prologue and in the reenactment of the murder.  However, the biggest debit is Albert Finney (Poirot), who doesn't fit Agatha Christie's famed dignified Belgian sleuth.  He's tall, has a rough voice, laughs like he's on drugs, and looks more like a grotesque gargoyle than a calm and refined gentleman.  A pity David Suchet wasn't born sooner, as Peter Ustinov's Poirot is only slightly better.",1088208000,6,3480,5.061295971978984
263548,3,6300216721,"While the movie is a faithful adaptation of Agatha Christie's book, Albert Finney's portrayal of the quirky but brilliant Hercule Poirot is disappointing.  Even those who are not familiar with David Suchet's interpretation will be disappointed if they have read many of the Poirot mysteries.  Gone are most of Poirot's most obvious traits--his enormous vanity, his charm, his fastidiousness.  If Albert Finney was familiar with Agatha Christie's character at all before the movie, it was only a very slight aquaintance.
The rest of the cast is impeccable--Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Ingred Bergman--the list goes on and on.  While some parts of the story have been changed, they are only slight changes and the movie remains true to the spirit and story of the book.",1087084800,6,768,5.169354838709677
263549,5,6300216721,"Take a star studded cast with legendary actors such as Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Richard Widmark, John Gielguld, Wendy Hillier and many more and put them on a train together and what do you have?
You have one of the best ""whodunits"" of all time.
Even now I can watch this film again and again even though I know who killed the ""baddie.""
With a deliciously complex plot, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" takes you on a suspenseful train journey across Europe in which one man will die a gruesome death and another will attempt to find out the truth surrounding his demise.
Hercule Poriot, Albert Finney at his best plays the diminutive but brilliant Belgian (not French) Detective who by a quirk of fate finds himself on the Orient Express with an odd group of people, from a Regal Russian Countess, to a loud mouthed American woman, a Hungarian diplomat and his fragile and beautiful wife, a well spoken English Butler, a nervous female Swedish Missionary out to save ""little brown babies,"", an ex-British Military Officer, a young woman on a touring holiday, an educated young man acting as a personal secretary to a shady art dealer, a surly German cook, a timid French Conductor, an Italian salesman, a Pinkerton Detective whose lives are to interlink in the strangest of ways with the despised murder victim Ratchett (the shady art dealer) played by the often under valued actor Richard Widmark.
This case of murder most vile will be one of Hercule's most difficult cases and as he systematically digs for the truth among the frightened and sometimes hostile passengers he is eventually confronted with a moral dilemma of frightening proportions and a question arises that he never thought he would have to answer.
Should he bring the killer to justice or should he let sleeping dogs lie?
A remake of this film was made in 2001 putting it into a modern context and though it was enjoyable to watch it was not a patch on the 1974 version.
A treat of a film for all you Agatha Christie and Hercule Poriot fans out there.",1073606400,3,2039,4.714285714285714

263551,4,6300216721,"Nearly 30 years after its release, the star-studded ""Murder on the Orient Express"" remains one the the best of the big screen's adaptations of Agatha Christie's works. Confined to the fabled train with the richest of the ultra-privileged class and trapped by a mammoth snow drift, everyone comes under suspicion when a self-described businessman (Richard Widmark) who turns out to be the mastermind of a child kidnapping that ends in murder of the child, is himself murdered (who can ignore the obvious similarity to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping?). Everyone in the all-star cast comes under suspicion, from Lauren Bacall as a character intended to scrape the nerves raw, to Ingrid Bergman in an Oscar-winning supporting role, to the breathtakingly beautiful Jacqueline Bissett, to Anthony Perkins, the late Sir John Geilgud and a magestic Wendy Hiller. But Albert Finney, as celebrated investigator Hercule Peroit, is amazing. True to Christie form, we come to a totally unexpected solution and resolution that doesn't deter us from watching this film time and again. Lavishly produced and rich in scenery, we actually get a sense of being trapped on the motionless train wondering who of our fellow passengers did the dirty deed, which is what makes this film so enjoyable with every viewing. More satisfying is that the viewer won't feel cheated by an ending that one critic at the time dismissed as ""too easy."" That aside, it's little wonder the film was an Academy favorite in multiple nominations.",1043193600,14,1503,5.163934426229508
263552,3,6300216721,"Murder on the Orient Express would appear to have all the necessary ingredients for a classic film. It is arguably Agatha Christie's most ingenious and atmospheric novel, and her cosmopolitan dramatis personae aboard the famous train are vividly brought to life by the largely outstanding star-studded cast. Yet it somehow seems to fall strangely flat.
Having said that, the induction of the viewer into the mise-en-scene is superb. In an eerie silent sequence, drained of all colour and interspersed with newspaper headlines, we are acquainted with the kidnapping and slaying of little Daisy Armstrong. So when the perpetrator of the kidnapping is himself murdered, even the famous detective Hercule Poirot is inclined to consider it natural justice. But still, murder *has* been committed and somewhere amongst the strangers - whose destiny is controlled by the train - a killer is at work. But who is it? For they all have alibis, and yet, incredibly all have a motive.
Aside from some initial scenes in Istanbul, the action is confined to the train, making this a psychologically interesting and character-driven story. Hence, it is a pity that many of the parts have been reduced to little more than cameo roles. In addition, Albert Finney (whilst visually very much Christie's Poirot) plays the Belgian sleuth with unfortunate crudity.
The multi-cultural hustle and bustle of Istanbul Station is portrayed with vibrancy, but so much of the movie is spent in setting the scene and in the lengthy denouement, that important plot components are rather rushed and lacking in impact. Indeed, Poirot seems to deduce the killer's identity almost immediately, and with only a modicum of detection. However, in the end the excellent storyline carries the film to its unexpected and triumphant conclusion.",1032134400,3,1801,5.235294117647059

It's got stellar performances from Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall and Wendy Hiller, and only slightly less impressive ones from most of the rest of the cast.  The look is just too 1930s retro chic for words, and the balance between comedy and drama is deft.  If you're looking for a film to sink down into like a big, comfy sofa, look no further.",1022544000,17,412,4.466666666666667

263585,5,6300216721,"One of Agatha Christie's best novels has been transformed into perhaps the best feature film based on her works.  Of the six I have seen, only the 1945 version of ""And Then There Were None"" rivals this one.
After a newsreel style montage descrbing a kidnapping, based on the Lindbergh case, which is backstory for the film, we open in Istanbul.  A group of passengers board the famous Orient Express for a journey across Europe to Calais.  On board, among others, are a railway executive, Bianchi, and his friend Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian (don't call him French) detective.  Also on board are an American businessman, Mr. Ratchett, and his secretary and valet, as well as about 10 other passengers.  One night, the train is forced to stop by a snowstorm, and the next morning, Mr. Ratchett is discovered murdered in his berth.  Bianchi persuades Poirot to determine who has killed him, and the real story begins...
As Poirot, Albert Finney is the center of this film.  While his Poirot may be jarring to those used to David Suchet in the BBC series--Finney is far more animated, even histrionic--he nevertheless conveys the character's intellect, and his ego, quite ably.  Finney is superb in the extended final scene, where Poirot reconstructs the murder.
The supporting cast is glittering, and generally very strong.  Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, although her role is actually fairly small.  Lauren Bacall has the meatiest role aside from Poirot, and she is in splendid form.  Vanessa Redgrave, despite having only minimal dialogue, makes a very strong impression, while John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are nearly as fine.  Only Anthony Perkins, somewhat miscast and stammering through his lines, and Michael York, whose accent, ostensibly Hungarian, comes and goes, fall short of the high standards of their costars.
Richard Rodney Bennet's score is very nice, and well matched to the action, and the opening scenes, before the action closes in on the snowed-in train, are visually beautiful.  While the pace may be a bit slow for those accustomed to action films in the ""Lethal Weapon"" style, I encourage everyone to give ""Murder on the Orient Express"" a try.",1006473600,11,2198,5.022038567493113
263586,1,6300216721,"I had intentionally not read this book because I wanted to be able to watch the movie without spoiling it and to avoid the inevitable disappointment with the way a movie mangles a book.  I was excited to finally be able to watch this.  I very much wanted to be pleased and overwhelmed by this movie because I was led to believe it was WONDERFUL!!  I WAS overwhelmed, but I was not pleased.
The cast was definitely star studded - it seemed that every star available was in this.  The setting / props were gorgeous.  So why 1 star?  Albert Finney as Poirot was horrible - you could not understand a single word he said - we constantly rewound but were still unable to understand his garbled mockery of a foreign accent.  Some of the other characters had the same problem though not nearly as bad.  What is the point of spending all that money on a movie the audience can not understand or follow?  I'm not comparing Albert Finney to David Suchet, I don't think that is fair or appropriate (different times, different budgets, etc) to do this.
I was excited to watch this movie and I had great expectations, but within 15 minutes, I was disgusted and the only reason I continued to the end was because I forced mysself to - ""I looked forward to this so much, I'm going to finish it even if it stinks"" idea.
I'm sorry, but I don't see how any one could give this movie anything but a bad rating if they are being honest.  Agatha Christie, Poirot, and a wonderful cast and set do not automatically equate to a great movie.",994118400,12,1517,4.366548042704626

Albert Finney embodied Poirot from top to bottem so much so that all other portrails pale by comparison.  Even the remarkable work of David Suchet cannot touch Finney. Poirot is an eccentric ego-ist who is also one of the most intelligent characters ever created and Finney captures his qualities perfectly. The rest of the cast is equally superb! With an interational cast of Vanessa Redgrave, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Wendy Hiller, Sean Connery, Richard Widmark, Jean-Pierre Cassel etc. one wonders why all of them were not nominated for Oscars. The entire film is a work of art from the production design to the costumes, make-up and music.  All these elements under the direction of Sidney Lumet are kept flowing swifty so that you have to rewind over and over till you catch all the nuances.  The book can be a bit confusing and plodding despite the wonderful prose but the film clears away any clutter and solidifies the story.  Yes the film changes some names and some early locations but it also clarifies some plot points particularly the Armstrong case.  Agatha Christie saw this version of her story brought to life on screen and approved of it.  This film will delight the viewer with each repeated playing to the point that after a while you're going to have to get another tape the old one will become so worn!",988070400,12,1411,4.7818930041152266

Surprisingly, my only criticism of the film is the lead performance by Finney, which is mannered, difficult to understand at times, and not at all what I picture Poirot as being like, having read a number of Christie's books.  The rest of the cast is terrific, with special praise going to Ingrid Bergman and Wendy Hiller.  The final scenes of revelation are very well done, and whether or not you already know the story and solution to the crime, I think you will find this movie to be very entertaining.",986515200,13,927,4.739130434782608

In the end, when the ""great detective"" is telling us who the murderer is, you suddenly have access to all kinds of facts and things you NEVER saw before that time. I wasn't along for the ride.
