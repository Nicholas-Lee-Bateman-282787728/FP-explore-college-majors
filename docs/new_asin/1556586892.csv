180162,4,1556586892,"I just bought this DVD five days ago and I've watched it 12 times.  I just can't stop looking at Warhol. I wish this DVD were longer and had more shots of ""THE MAN"", but overall, it represented him as I remember him from my youth in the sixties.  I also liked the interviews with the people that made the Facatory what it was.  I was left feeling that I wanted more; more pictures, more narative, more interviews, just more of everything.

I would buy it again, but I really do feel the need to acuire more of the same type of thing when and where I can!",1158969600,7,554,4.101851851851852
180163,3,1556586892,I found the DVD enlightening even though it did not provide an indepth look at this very complex man.  Missing were some very important details of his early life.  Things which were important to shaping his career.  Also there was not enough emphasis on the Factory people.  I did appreciate the fact that Gerard Malanga was a producer and did a great deal of narration.,1155945600,6,370,4.6461538461538465
180164,4,1556586892,"It is ironic that many of our most creative Artists are never truly appreciated until they are gone.  The Superstar DVD affords us an interesting insight into the life and times of Mr. Warhol.  I especially liked the Directors Commentary option where Mr. Workman speaks about the film.  If you are into Andy Warhol, this is a nice remember when.  That being said, I would be remiss if I did not mention a living Artist, who I would like to be so bold as to call the ""Andy Warhol"" of the new digital age.  His name is Laurence Gartel.  He is called the ""Father of Digital Media"" and to any Multi-media student, Photographer, or Artist, he is truly unique.  He has a new DVD out entitled Trance, Dance and Other Living things which features thousands of his photo's and art in a surround sound multi-media format, the likes of which I have never seen. I read mediamaniacs review, and it was great.  If you liked Mr. Warhol, you are going to love Gartel.  I bought the DVD, and then emailed Mr. Gartel, who actually responded to my email (himself), and answered several questions.  Imagine being able to communicate directly with a guy who is in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian.  This is truly a digital age, and I think Gartel can become our Warhol of the new millenium with alittle support from all of us.  I do not want to get to stuffie, but this fellow is truly and National Treasure, and the Arts really need to support him.",1097712000,3,1439,4.492307692307692

7795874,5,1556586892,"For more indepth study of Andy most any of the biographies would do nicely. The Life and Death of Andy Warhol by Bockris is good vulgar journalism, now on to the movie. There are things missing from this film, of course, there's so much to cover for a 90 minute film. But they did a great job. It will pique your curiosity. Please, seek out more. It's always rewarding to delve into Warhol. I particularly like the openning talk with his relatives, as one of his cousins, a middle class housewife(everybody's mom type), admits to reading Andy's Philosophy and shockingly agrees with most of it. ""He's just like us"", she quipped. I was hooked immediately. The early childhood drawings and art work are shown. It was clear genius was at hand. The movie draws you in. There's plenty of Art and cameos of the famous. Roy Leichtenstein,Grace Jones,Liza Minnelli,Dennis Hopper is extra special, and many more. Really fine mixing of the various film types home movies to 90's digital. It is quite fun to see some of these wonderful paintings and portraits on your big jumbo tron plasma TV screen. It instantly transforms your living room into the Whitley Museum. Loved it, so does Roger Ebert. Ps be sure to get any of the art books about Andy, they are all good. I recommend the one by Cotter Ratcliff.",1347840000,2,1296,4.663755458515284

7795876,5,1556586892,"I find myself turning this film when I can't sleep and need a little cheering up...  What a beautiful documentary!

Done with music of the day, chronicling Warhol's life through those who knew him, it's a quick and fun sweep of imagery, inspiration and nostalgia.  What stands out for me is Warhol's penchant for being able to mix with different kinds of people from all walks of life.  He was by no means perfect as a person, but he was special, with a knack for teaching himself how to celebrate life.  Certainly he is an exemplar for anyone who struggles and wants to make his or her way in the world!

This film will remind you to be thankful for being alive.",1251331200,,663,4.39344262295082
7795877,4,1556586892,"I have 3 other dvd documentaries on Andy Warhol ( ""Life & Death of Andy Warhol"", The PBS 2 disc set & ""Andy Warhol: The Complete Picture"" ) and this is the one which has stood up to repeated viewings. It features more interview clips with Andy than any of the others, and the opening title sequence actually demonstrates how Warhol and his assistants went about creating the large screened portraits for which Warhol is so well known. There are interview clips with many of the Warhol superstars as well as an informative and thoughtful audio commentary track by the director. The black & white interview footage of a very consciously spaced out Warhol being questioned by an interviewer as he sits with fingers lightly touching his lips and a great befuddled look on his face is the best!",1198800000,9,789,4.683453237410072
7795878,3,1556586892,"I think this is the weakest of the 3 comprehensive Warhol documentaries, (the best being the PBS doc - Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film, followed by: Andy Warhol - The Complete Picture). It just seems lightweight compared to those and the background music in this I found really distracting. There is some  specific footage of the Velvet Underground playing @ the Factory, footage of Edie Sedgwick, and others that I hadn't seen before and is noteworthy, but it is very brief.",1188432000,3,475,4.864197530864198
