7994499,5,B00009ZK6M,This DVD truly is exceptional. Dalke Sensei's technique is precise and timing is phenomenal.  I'm not a veteran in the Martial Arts by any means but this DVD has been a great help to me thus far.  Can't wait to view the rest of the serious!!!,1131926400,,242,4.239130434782608
7994500,1,B00009ZK6M,"I have been looking for some decent Karate DVDs for quite some time and thought I would give this series a try. After purchasing and watching this DVD, I am at a loss at what the point is. This man shows the viewer nothing, and explains very little. None of it is useful.

There is quite a bit of discussion regarding the way someone with Karate knowledge and skills should be behave. Staying out of fights and so on. The idea behind this good, but the execution is lacking. It doesn't really matter however, as people watching this won't learn anything that can harm someone else anyway.

It appears that the point of this DVD is for Mr. Dalke and friends to talk about how wonderful he is, and how wonderful the rest of the series will be.

He places an incorrect meaning onto a Japanese word, gives an incorrect explanation of what it means, then uses it throughout the DVD. The visual quality is that of a 15 year old VHS tape that has been viewed 1000 times, and the sound quality is pitiful. You hear more breathing than you do instruction (when there is instruction).

I could do a better job myself using my limited Karate experience and a cheap digital camcorder. Don't waste your money on this. You won't learn a single thing no matter what your level of experience.",1099094400,6,1276,4.463519313304721
