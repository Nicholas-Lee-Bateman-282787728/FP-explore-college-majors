4307245,5,B004AE3QUS,"More of the same fantastic Midsomer Murders style, for now, while we have leads like John Nettles (DCI Barnaby), Jason Hughes (assistant copper), Jane Wymark (wife Joyce), and Laura Howard as daughter, Cully. That alone guarantees 5 stars for performers, add the writing for plots to the multiple murders (a signature must) and don't forget the divine looks at country life in England. These ""sets"" are the real thing, great locations scouted for picture perfection. Sure adds to the complex murder investigations and the suspense that is sustained throughout each episode. Add a bit of good family life of the cops and some family humor at times, and you have above-and-beyond the best British Mystery Murder Crime series ever produced. OK, that's an opinion, but one shared by millions on both sides of the Atlantic.

No foul language issues, but plenty of good family murder mystery--the murder is almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body. How many ways can a person be murdered? The shows seem to be released to DVD faster than ever, considering showing schedules in multiple countries. A tip of the had to Acorn Media. Also SUBTITLES. Not rated by good for teens and older.

The episodes each about 100 min.: Inspired by Caroline Graham novels.
The Dogleg Murders, aired March 2009
Whiteoak golf course in Worthy is found Crisp's Folly, hole 13 and a blind dogleg. While searching for a ball, a rude golfer is ironed to death, his own club. Suspicious death! As in the Barnaby and Midsomer tradition, the murders accumulate faster than pars. And a club member tells Barnaby about gambling on the greens. Duh, it's golf for Pete's sake. What a delicious golf course to see, outstanding scenic tour, as is all of Midsomer Murder episodes. Is that another murderous ball sliced? Fore!

The Black Book, aired March 2009
18th Century art lovers will enjoy this forgery, swindling, murderous episode. A lady sells a newly discovered local artist, Henry Hogson, oil for a bundle and is immediately murdered. Don't seek Hogson under real Art History. Midsomer's art community, or forgery club, is a tough group to crack. Barnaby is up to the challenge but will the body count be higher than the forgery count at the end?

Secrets and Spies, aired July 2009
A `safe house' run by an ex-spy for other agents may not be as safe as believed. The keeper of the spy house is the first to find out how truly unsafe it is. Then his son is killed in a similar fashion, apparently by an animal or wolfman. Barnaby's too quick to fall for that one and heightens his search for clues. A spy vs spy thriller with Barnaby to save the day.

The Glitch, aired July 2009
Bucketman comes to the rescue, avenging all those mistreated by Midsomer road hogs, by tossing red paint at them. There is plenty of action scenes to impress paint-ball fans. Locals think it fun, till murder catches on as well. There is also espionage and blackmail plots at work, keeping Barnaby and his helper, DS Jones (Jason Hughes), very busy. Then comes ""The Glitch"".

If you've missed out on some of the past Midsomer Murders releases then you can find catchup sets to save money. ""Midsomer Murders-The Early Cases Collection"", ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" & ""Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files"". Those 3 sets will get you 51 more feature length mysteries.",1290038400,90,3365,4.803108808290156
4307246,5,B004AE3QUS,"Based on a set of only seven novels by Caroline Graham (beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killings-at-Badger-s-Drift/dp/1933397047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killings at Badger's Drift</a>), Midsomer Murders is a long-running and very popular series that debuted in the U.K. in 1997. The series features the likable Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and is set in the fictional English county of Midsomer which consists of several villages each of which seems to rival Cabot Cove, Maine for their improbably high murder rates.

Agatha Christie, the world's most successful mystery writer, considered plot to be of utmost importance when crafting her stories. Graham, on the other hand, has said that she prefers to start out with interesting characters and allow the plot to form around them. And it is certainly the characters that are the centerpiece of Midsomer Murders. Unusual, odd and memorable are all words that could be used to describe the show's colorful collection of villagers - including the murderers, the victims and the bystanders, very few of whom could be described as ""innocent"".

Part police procedural, part quirky cozy, part traditional whodunit, Midsomer Murders should appeal to a variety of murder mystery fans. Even after seeing nearly 70 episodes, I find the show remains dependably entertaining with strong writing, intricate plots and uniformly first-rate acting. Episodes exist more or less independent of one another and need not be viewed in broadcast order. However, because of Barnaby's changing Detective Sergeants over the years, viewers might wish to do so.

One of my favorite aspects of the series is the gorgeous glimpses it provides of the English countryside and the picturesque villages, vine covered cottages and grand estates in which the stories are set. For true devotees, the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-on-Location/dp/1901091376/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders on Location</a>&nbsp;provides information on where each episode was filmed. I'm also inordinately fond of the theme music which seems to suit the quirkiness of Midsomer Murders perfectly.

The following episodes are included in Set 17:

* The Dogleg Murders (Episode 67): After a player is murdered on the course at a prestigious golf club, Barnaby and Jones discover a bevy of crimes, and more murder, among the club's members.
* The Black Book (Episode 68): The sale at auction of a newly discovered masterpiece by a Midsomer painter seems to be the catalyst for a series of murders.
* Secrets and Spies (Episode 69): Barnaby's past as a secret agent comes into play when another former agent is murdered after a cricket match.
* The Glitch (Episode 70): Barnaby suspects that the threat by a local university fellow to reveal a glitch in a new software program mistakenly caused the hit and run killing of a local school teacher.

All four episodes have SDH subtitles.

Because of the somewhat unorthodox behavior of a number of the characters, some rare flashes of nudity and the often gruesome nature of the crimes, I feel Midsomer Murders is best suited to older teens and adults.

Highly recommended.",1288828800,177,3282,5.643002028397566

If you're a fan of British TV and particularly crime dramas, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this collection. Sadly, these later seasons are not so difficult to figure out as the earlier seasons won, but they're still enjoyable..",1412035200,,403,4.771428571428571

We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The motives that caused the villagers to murder are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.

What fun to read the cast interviews - Nettles as a wicked sense of humor. The filming is of course a treat, but so are the stories, absurd as they are at times. ""Midsomer Murders"" often deftly explore not only British history, but the class-system. In ""The Dogleg Murders"" bribery and caste meet, i.e. my kingdom for a golf course membership. In ""The Black Book,"" painted poser pigs reveal fraudulent art. In ""Secrets and Spies,"" Barnaby is revealed as a former MI5 operative. ""The Glitch"" entertains with more class issues and business dealings, with cyclists enjoying the lovely countryside. You simply can't go wrong with any of the Midsomer series.

4307333,5,B004AE3QUS,The Midsomer Murders series continues to be very well done.  We have viewed every episode produced and look forward to the next release.,1316304000,,136,4.913043478260869
4307334,5,B004AE3QUS,"Midsomer Murders is one of my all time favorite BBC series, and this set ranks with the best of the collection. The entire format was based on the novels of Caroline Graham, whose first Inspector Barnaby novel, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift,"" was published in 1988 and named as one of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time.

The tone of the series as a whole is one of dark humor and stark contrasts.  Murders are often spiteful and apropos of the victim's life ways, in short they often get their just deserts.  For all the insanity of the small village murders, their suspects and victims, Barnaby's private life is completely normal.  He argues with his wife over the details of their life together, forgets, remembers or inadvertently misses important events, and manages to make up for his mistakes in agreeable ways.  Joyce is a woman used to doing things alone.  Forced by her husband's career to endure his absence, she has become a strong central character with a life of her own; my favorite statement by Joyce about her policeman husband is that at their wedding, ""Instead of saying 'I do,' he said 'I've got it!'""

In this set and as usual, the evil doers are a bit crazy, the victims numerous, and inspector Barnaby quite ingenious. My favorite of the set is ""Secrets and Spies"" which features 007 types in later life; one does tend to wonder what happens to the James Bond types when they hit their late 60s and early 70s).  Here an attempt is made to sideline Barnaby to prevent him from getting too close to the truths behind past deeds kept hidden for years. Frustrated by ""old school ties"" that prevent him from doing his job, he resigns, leaving those now in control to sort things out as more people die. Proving by inaction his value as a skilled policeman and as a brilliant solver of mysteries, he is quickly reinstated and given back control over the case, which is then speedily resolved.  Lovely story.

The regular characters are a treat as always. Their interpersonal relationships are a pleasure because they are so normal amidst the insanity of events. Joyce's responses to Barnaby's resignation in ""Secrets and Spies"" is so typical of their life together.  Barnaby may be a genius at crime detection, but to Joyce he's her spouse and treated accordingly and endearingly.

4307339,5,B004AE3QUS,"This show unlike other detective shows was never played straight. It's always been over the top and fun.
Midsomer has more murders than a large city and each episode has lots of eccentric characters. HOwever the characters probably do have real life counterparts somewhere. Each set gets a one star review from a serious detective show fan. Ah.... this is semiserious and well more like a grimms fairtale sometimes! That's why this show is so loved that even with the main character leaving it this year in episode 81 the show is continuing on quite well! This show is fun and unlike past sets this actually has extras on each disc. Basically interviews from cast members (guest) and other facts. That's more than we got in the past. This one like all midsomer shows has themes in them, we have a golf episode, a cricket episode, a spy episode, a art forgery episode. This was a few years back and with the newer releases we are getting closer to the new series out now on tv.  The guest stars in this one are as good as ever and that helps, it's always good to see peter davidson too, he was once the youngest doctor who back in 1980-83! And he was the star of the classic 'all creatures great and small' series as well for many years.
Well nettles is gone but we still haven't gotten his classic 1980's tv show ""bergerac"" on dvd here yet. Wake up acorn and lets see that one too, it ran for ten seasons!",1311984000,,1405,4.403846153846154

4307386,5,B004AE3QUS,"Set seventeen (17) of the series of ""Midsomer Murders"" finds the viewing audience, again, looking at some very good British murder mysteries that are set in the beautiful and seemly peaceful little quaint village of Midsomer and its surrounding picturesque areas.  Again in Set seventeen (17) on four (4) discs running about 1 hour and 40 minutes each, one is not allowed to get too comfortable with the beauty and outward appearance of the locale because behind the doors and garden gates, there are loads of dastardly happenings to a lot of fascinating and sometimes very weird characters that are played by some of Britain's finest and well-known actors.  Be aware that the episode ""The  Black Book"" is really good.  It's all about folks being killed for Forged Art Works with a very surprising ending.

In light of the above folks are meeting their demise in a lot of unthought-of, by me, ways.  Of course Barnaby (brilliantly played by John Nettles--he is so very good often very funny and always mild mannered with no barking of orders!) and his assistant (wonderfully  played very  humorously by Jason Hughes who is featured more in set 17) solve the ""who done it"" element brillantly with especially Barnaby's keen insights, intuition and very mellow manner.

The viewing of and subsequent enjoyment of the ""Midsomer Murder"" series has been part of my life for many years.  Again without gratuitous  visible violence, set seventeen (17) is no exception to my admiration of this series; I still indeed do find this British murder/mystery/detective series to be so very well written and acted.",1299024000,,1598,4.992452830188679
4307387,5,B004AE3QUS,"We are nearing the end of John Nettles' portrayal of the indefatigable DCI Tom Barnaby.  Yet, he has aged very little since the series started in 1997.  The four stories are just as we now expect them--quirky people living in Midsomer, horrific murders, and with the truly valuable aid of DI Ben Jones (Jason Hughes).  I actually believe that after having a new, not formally educated DS Troy who was truly a grunt (but a nice and good grunt), and DS Scott (John Hopkins) who was sent down from the Met for doing something we are never told, Barnaby is now a better DCI because of the intelligence of Ben Jones who is more a help than a hindrance to solving the crimes.

The colleague/colleague relationship rather than the father/son relationship with the other two, has now mellowed into a fine wine, with a great body, a superior nose and a wonderful taste on the tongue.  Thankfully, there will be probably three more sets to come out before Tom retires and his relation (I think cousin), John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) replaces him.  After 13 years of watching Midsomer Murders and watching and re-watching the DVDs, we Americans, as usual fall in love with Buckinghamshire, where most of the stores are filmed.  We love to see homes and estates that are not usually a part of the typical American landscape and I think we lose ourselves in the background, even though over 200+ murders and suicides have been committed in must one county in Britain.

If only Morse could have had more episodes to watch; but since only 33 were made and Nettles will have made 82 episodes when he leaves.  There is no telling how many Dudgeon will make, but if the stories can remain fresh as I think they will, I am hoping for another 82 to watch.

So, now is on to Set 18, 19 and 20.  Many a tear will be shed when TB's final episode is watched just as it was when Troy left when he became a DI.  Thank, John, for 82 great episodes and to all the great writers and actors many of whom are making their second appearance.
