149325,5,0792843991,"This was a great movie. It's funny but it's there's a certian sweetness to the story as Thorton Melon goes back to school to help his son, Jason, stay in school. It takes a turn when Thorton was there for himself and loses his  objective to help Jason. In the end they help eachother out to foil the  plans of the evil teacher. Get it it's funny every step of the way.",951868800,,368,4.097222222222222
149326,5,0792843991,"While indeed a very funny film, it is also a biting commentary on the unjustified arrogance of many academicians: those who know do, those who don't publish! (Yes publish not just teach.) In addition, the film cleverly  binds the generations and inspires one and all to avoid myopic ageisms.  If  Rodney Dangerfield is ever to be credited as anything more than the  ""very-well known comic,"" Back To School, then, is clearly his  defining moment.",914198400,3,445,4.95945945945946

149399,5,0792843991,"When Thornton Melon was a young lad, his hard working father told him that he was a Melon and could do anything, but with out a formal education he was nothing. But Thornton instead went into business and made a fortune. Today he has a son and told him that he also is a Melon and can do anything. He sends his son to collage to get a formal education. Soon he finds his some can use some help and that tempered with a divorce spears Thornton to finally get the education he missed.

Rodney has been in many films. However this is the one I will always relate him to. Aside from his one liners and ""I get no respect"" gags he does a good job of bring out the best (and worst) abut collage. I will admit that he does not look like Bing Crosby in ""High Time"" (1960); however we have just as much fun watching him adjust and then do one better.

On of my favorite parts is when he has Kurt Vonnegut Jr. doing his homework; that is called delegation.

One annoying part of school is when someone says there is so much ""picture framing material"" and asks how do you make a picture twice as wide as it is high? People usually measure the picture for the frame. So when the professor said let's build a factory and Thorton Melon asks what are you going to make? I about fell off my seat.",1502236800,,1279,4.128514056224899

149694,5,0792843991,"When I think of Rodney Dangerfield, I think of Caddyshack first and foremost. Then, of course, he has Easy Money and this one. A great guy and very funny all around. The movie itself is pretty good and has it's humorous moments for certain. Keith Gordon plays his son away at college. One day, his dad gets a divorce and decides to visit his son, unannounced. Well, things get dicey from there as his father soon enrolls as a student as well! Hilarious. I would recommend this if you really like Rodney and his comedic style.
This Blu-ray is okay, but I think could have been done better, picture wise. The special features are pretty good, however and they are far better than the lackluster DVD bonus features.

149853,4,0792843991,"THE STORY (contains mild spoilers): Rodney plays Thornton Melon, a successful 'Tall & Fat' clothing store tycoon who enrolls in college in order to spend time with (and bolster the confidence of) his waffling, seemingly unpopular son, who only wants to drop out and get a regular job. In typical blustery Dangerfield fashion, Thornton takes over the campus and inadvertently ends up further alienating his son, who just can't seem to get out from under the shadow of his popular father.

THOUGHTS: Probably my favorite Rodney Dangerfield film, not including his guest-star role in the classic CADDYSHACK. Rodney seems relaxed and confident in this film and the laughs come more naturally and don't seem as forced or like bits of stand up that are inserted into the script. He has a natural affinity with Keith (CHRISTINE) Gordon, who plays his son, Jason. It is actually a really good film in its own right and the Dangerfield bits are just a big, hilarious bonus. There are some strong supporting turns by actors Ned Beatty and the lovely Sally Kellerman (she looks scrumptious in all of the simple-yet-elegant outfits she wears), and a side-splitting bit part by the late, great 'scream-comedian' Sam Kinison. Burt Young, (""Paulie"" from the ROCKY films), is Thornton's chauffeur/best friend, the gruff, lovable Lou. Adrienne Barbeau and Robert Picardo have small but memorable roles as Thorton's adulteress wife and her flaky Latin lover. It was also great fun to watch the hilarious performance by a young Robert Downey, Jr., playing Derek Lutz, the oddball roommate of Thornton's son. You could see even then that his rapid, smart delivery, quick-wit and comedic timing were already fairly well-honed. He would go on to snag a few other excellent roles, then hit a rather rough patch in his life & career, before eventually blasting his way to movie superstardom as quirky ""billionaire genius playboy philanthropist"" Tony Stark/Iron Man in the wildly popular Marvel Comics series of films. (It's quite obvious that at some time in the past Downey got his teeth fixed, too.)

THE BLU-RAY: Now the not so good news. Once again, poor Rodney Dangerfield gets no respect. The Blu-ray presentation of BACK TO SCHOOL looks passable but sadly is nothing to write home about. Lots of pixelation & video noise in low light scenes. Audio is solid & level, thankfully. There are some decent bonus features included on this Blu-ray that offset the lackluster presentation. This is NOT a reference copy of the film by any means. If you don't have this film then it's still worth it if you like Dangerfield. Perhaps one day it will get a proper crisp, razor-sharp well-balanced transfer, but until then this Blu-ray is still a recommended purchase because it can be had for just over $5 (used) here on Amazon. That's a deal. 5 STARS for the film, minus 1 STAR for the crummy transfer.",1431129600,,2873,4.946169772256729

In this day of rising educational costs, where graduates are more unemployable than their ""uneducated"" peers with no mortgage level debt. It typifies the age old saying. ""Those who can, do.

The plot is tissue-thin: Dangerfield is a wealthy clothier for the 'big&tall' crowd.  However, he never got a college degree and always felt incomplete without a diploma.  His son now has a chance to do what he never did but he's blowing it big time.  Dangerfield leaves his beautiful home(after a fight with his harpy spouse played brilliantly by Ms. Barbeau)to visit the son.  The twist is that Dangerfield gets so hung up on smoothing the college experience for his reluctant son that he jumps in to really show him how it should be done.  Now it was father AND son trying to cope with faculty and courses.  With a strange history prof(played perfectly by the late Sam Kinnison), plus a moving poetry teacher(wonderfully played by Sally Kellerman), Dangerfield takes it all in and somehow gets by with his street common sense and business experience(as opposed to Ivory tower book learning).  Ned Beatty(Deliverance) is wonderful as the dean whose primary concern is not the school's standards but just what Dangerfield, as a future alumnus, can contribute to the school funding.  Robert Downy Jr. is a perfect straight man for the father/son duo, playing the kid's college friend.
The secondary plot is the diving team; strangely, Dangerfield is cast as an old stunt diver who is drafted by the team to fill in at a competition.  The 'meet' is a means of having the good guys triumph in the end, I suppose...

This is strictly a zany fun movie; you can leave your brain in neutral and just let Dangerfield take control.  There are no down moments; it's all fun all the time.  If it's not quite at the level of the Blues Brothers or Caddyshack, it's 95% there and well worth what you see here...",1413763200,,1902,4.7272727272727275

This is one of his better movies. Again, Caddyshack did a wonderful job for showcasing his talents, but this one is right up there in the top.
This movie is definitely out there on some of the stunts pulled, but I would be willing to bet, if one thought about it, they knew people in college that were similar. If not, that person went to a way serious school, which meant they didn't have much fun. The acting is crazy. The characters are larger than real life, but I can't think of anyone in there I despised. The story line was real. Deal with school the best way you can if you are going to stay. Thornton just didn't want his kid to suffer up the ranks like he did. And yes, us parents are willing to do just about anything we can for our kids. If it is in our power, we will. Well... Maybe not hire NASA to do the astronomy papers.
The disc is not crisp, but when it was made, it looked just like it did when I saw it in the theaters. Some people don't like perfect technology, but for me it is a good reminder of the time of the movie. It's like Gone With The Wind. I don't think having it in color does it justice. It is an old movie, shoe me that. Back To School gets the same echo.",1409616000,2,1351,4.026022304832714

There's also a subplot about his son's love life.

Rodney Dangerfield could be very funny as a stand-up comic. He could be funny in small doses, but in this film his chemistry isn't quite enough to carry the film through. Still, a lot of funny bits. It's worth watching just for the performance of Sam Kinison as a history professor. Also, a brief appearance by Kurt Vonnegut.",1406937600,,686,4.532258064516129

The contrast between his view of the world and the academic environment leads to some very funny scenes.

This movie showcases all his comic ability and timing and got him the respect he deserved.  A huge hit it tickles the funny bone and has a great plot that showed Rodney could hold his own with the young people as well.

Seeing the developing Robert Downey Jr. as well as Sam Kinison at his finest in the film was a treat also.

He essentially plays his Rodney persona, but his character is Thornton Melon (changed from Meloni) a tall and fat clothing tycoon. The characters tend to be stererotypical and sometimes caricature, but done deliberately to make you like or hate them as Rodney wishes.

150190,5,0792843991,"One of my favorite comedies has always been CADDYSHACK. Many of the best laughs came from that great character actor Bill Murray. But the real high points in that film were from Rodney Dangerfield. Every time he came on screen he made me roar with laughter, then he would disappear only to come out again. With BACK TO SCHOOL, he plays a similar character, although a nicer one. And unlike some other comedies starring a famous funnyman it doesn't depend 100% on that comedian. It contains other actors who also make me laugh.

Dangerfield plays Thorton Melon. His birth name was Meloni and was the son of a New York tailor. But at some point in his life he changed his name to Melon. His dad told him that a man is nothing without an education, and he could do anything he wanted in life. Thorton went into the business and became a millionaire by opening a clothing franchise to overweight people. He was also at one time a show diver in New Jersey and had a wonderful first wife who gave birth to his son. After the opening credits we see Dangerfield in an obnoxious TV commercial for his company: Tall and Fat. Right away I was laughing out loud. And that was just for starters.

Melon attends a meeting with his company Board of Directors. All of them are overweight and when he walks in the room Dangerfield delivers a funny line. But even though Melon's business is important to him, the one thing he really cares about besides his bodyguard Lou (Burt Young) is his son Jason (Keith Gordon), who is a freshman in college. This isn't surprising, since he is married to a two timing lady (Adrienne Barbou). During a party he delivers a tasteless insult to one of her friends, which made me laugh out loud. Thorton thinks that his son is on the diving team and in a fraternity. It turns out that he is the team's Towel Boy, and is not in a fraternity. The team's star diver is Chas (William Zabka). Although he doesn't like Jason he doesn't cause the kind of problems the same actor did to Ralph Macchio in THE KARATE KID. Jason is in love with Valerie Desmond, but she doesn't notice him. And the only friend he has is Derek Lutz (Robert Downey Jr.), a beatnik-like nutcase. Jason feels he would be better working like his dad then to complete college.

When Melon comes to visit the campus and discovers the truth about his son, he decides to enroll in the college himself. He never finished high school, so how is the dean known as Dean Martin (Ned Beatty) supposed to accept him, despite his business status? Melon opens up the Melon School of Business, and we meet what would become his biggest adversary in the school: Philip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), who is the head of the school's business dept. Barbay is a complete snob who hates Thorton immediately, but he gets his comeuppance in a dedication ceremony to the school. Thorton makes him look like a goon the first day of his class. That's two big laughs after another. Another one comes from a completely psychotic history teacher (Sam Kinison). Kinison was one of those comedy discoveries by Dangerfield and he uses it in his scenes, as a loudmouthed screamer.

Thorton believes that every obstacle that gets in his way can be solved by throwing money at it, or by using a romantic charm he uses when he falls in love with his English teacher Dr. Turner (Sally Kellerman). Dr. Barbay loves Dr. Turner as well, but he treats romance like a corporate manager. She prefers to be more free-spirited. He hires Kurt Vonnegut to help him with his work, and other assistants to help out with his homework. At first, this appears to be working out, but it soon turns against him.

Jason is a little bit embarrassed with his father, since he knows the man has to work to finish school and that Money and Love don't solve everything. His is even enraged at his dad when the man tries to solve some of Jason's troubles, especially when he's rumored to have paid the coach to get him on the diving team. But Keith Gordon is capable of delivering big laughs himself. In most of the movies he was in he was good for at least one laugh. There is a scene when Thorton's secretary sits in his regular seat during a class lecture. What she is doing is good for a laugh, but watch Keith next to her. The look on his face creates even more laughs with the scene. And he delivers a verbal comeuppance to Chas during a diving meet that gave me another laugh.

In the midst of the comedy there is even a music scene. The film's composer is Danny Elfman, and he makes a cameo with his old band Oingo Boingo. They perform a great song at a party Thorton throws to celebrate his son's acceptance into the team. But Jason already learned about what his father did with the coach and isn't enjoying the party. Derek tries to cheer him up, but Melon delivers a perfect rebuttal to his attempt.

I hope I haven't given away any of the laughs. I only described them vaguely. In a lesser actor they probably wouldn't be funny. But Dangerfield has such excellent timing in his one-liners and insults that he gets away with them. (For a clearer example of that you should see him in Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS) But his character is pretty much a likeable guy. That is true of the other characters in the film. The film ends at a graduation ceremony that looks like a real one. I had the feeling that Dangerfield improvised his speech to the class, and it's good for more laughs. Of course, I'm sure he improvised all the way through this movie.

Rodney Dangerfield never topped this movie in the rest of his career. But as I said about him in the previous paragraph, he had a little bit of a triumph in NATURAL BORN KILLERS. He is even more obnoxious and really cruel in that film, but he gets some laughs because of his perfect timing. He continued to act until his death in 2004 and I do miss him.",1349049600,2,5840,4.451401869158879

The plot is simple but Rodney Dangerfield's acting empowers the film.  He plays the role of an extremely wealthy but uneducated businessman whose son is not doing well in college.  To keep the son from dropping out, he decides to enroll himself.  What follows is a laugh a minute as the father, who is worldly wise and used to running an extremely successful business, has to deal with college classes as well as the snobbery of some of the teachers, especially one who is romancing a female English professor played by Sally Kellerman.

Dangerfield throws great parties, embarrasses the professor teaching about business and answers all questions with wisecracks.  He's a very sympathetic character and I loved the way he punches holes in the pretentiousness of academia in a way I could well relate to.

Of course the story is predictable and of course there were no surprises.  But it sure was a lot of fun.",1307750400,3,1085,4.693121693121693
150216,5,0792843991,"The only reason I'm not giving Back to School a 5-star rating is because Rodney Dangerfield isn't *quite* as funny as he normally is (or was, rather).  His style of humor is absolutely amazing to me because of his ability to whip out a witty, creative (and usually offensive) joke at the drop of a hat that cover a wide range of subjects, but there's several portions of Back to School that don't quite have me moved to tears of laughter, which is a bit out of the ordinary for a Rodney Dangerfield movie.

I believe Rodney Dangerfield is one of the best, if not the VERY funniest, comedians of all-time.  Easily in the top 5.

Anyway, Rodney goes back to school as a relatively old man (I guess considering Back to School was made in 1986 he wasn't *that* old yet) and goes through all the college courses only to quickly discover he's not cut out for most of the classes due to the high difficulty in learning the majority of the class work.  He's there with his son, who has problems of his own (such as trying to make it big on the diving team but failing for one reason or another) and of course, he has to deal with troublemakers who feel the need to constantly pick on him and give the poor kid a hard time.

Of course you already know Rodney will be there to stick up for his boy during times of great need.  As you can probably tell, this is very typical and predictable storytelling stuff for an 80's comedy movie, but it's not so terrible in this particular case since it stars such a funny comedian.

Overall, if only Rodney Dangerfield delivered even MORE jokes this would have definitely been a 5-star movie without hesitation (though one joke about elephants throwing peanuts at people at the zoo STILL has me in tears, at the moment I write this, lol).

Update- March 7th, 2014.  Okay I re-watched Back to School with my dad tonight, and probably because my dad's also a fan of Rodney (in fact he thinks Rodney Dangerfield is one of the funniest comedians of all-time) I've changed my opinion, and now I've found that there ARE in fact just as many classic Rodney jokes as usual despite my original review claiming Rodney was more tame than usual in this movie.  I guess I was too wrapped up in the 80's way of filmmaking to take notice of them all when I wrote my original review.

Anyway this movie is terrific.  We both enjoyed the segments where Rodney was jumping off the diving boards at a professional level (the triple jump was really hilarious) and admired/reminisced Rodney's trademark approach to telling a joke.  The man's perception was simply astounding!  He could grasp anything, take any line in the world, and make a joke out of it.  Sometimes crude, more crude the second time around than I originally noticed.  The one strict/tall teacher who never once cracked a smile was perfect material for Rodney to make fun of.  Anyway this is now a 5-star film.",1307664000,,2887,4.487571701720841
150217,5,0792843991,"Before getting to the film itself, I need to say something about the Blu-ray transfer. Though you can find the BD for substantially less than the price shown, you should be aware of the problems.

The first is that the transfer is from a theatrical print. There's the occasional white speck -- and a rather big white chunk missing (briefly) during the oral-exam sequence. There are also occasional density fluctuations, not surprising in a DeLuxe print (which uses the same IB process as Technicolor). Second, in scenes with very dark backgrounds, the dark areas break up into squares -- not unlike poking your nose near a window screen. IMPORTANT  It turns out that this is a side-effect of having Sharpness turned up all the way, and is not a flaw in the transfer. See my review of ""Highlander"" for a detailed discussion.)

On the other hand, the image is sharp and detailed, with no grain reduction. However, in the scene near the end where Jason is kissing Valerie, the grain on his over-lit forehead ""pops"" in a way that looks like an encoding artifact. In short, the transfer would have been better had the composite negative been used. But it's ""good enough"" that I can reasonably recommend it without feeling you're going to be badly disappointed.

The film itself is one of those ""guilty pleasures"" one needn't feel guilty about. It's one of those rare comedies that's actually funny -- and from beginning to end. Dangerfield is funny simply standing there -- his face was its own caricature. The casting is well-nigh perfect, with actors you'd never expect in such a low-budget film. Sally Kellerman and Ned Beatty are standouts, with the latter demonstrating that he can pull off just about any role. (Read the cast list and be prepared to be surprised.)

The writers aren't afraid to steal. The Melon/Turner/Barbay triangle parallels the MacMurray/Olsen/Reid triangle in ""The Absent-Minded Professor"", and even the opening visual gag of that film is taken. They also swipe the Marshall McLuhan gag from ""Annie Hall"".

A ""great"" film? No. Just a very entertaining one that, for this viewer, has not worn out its welcome.",1307059200,9,2131,4.905555555555556

150220,4,0792843991,"""Back to School"" is a cherished member of my VHS collection not only because of the late but inimitably immortal Rodney Dangerfield and his outrageous persona, but also because of its laceration of a favorite satiric target - college. ""Back to School"" came out in 1986 -a year after I graduated from Tufts University- and it nearly perfectly encapsulates (if slightly exaggerates) and skewers college life during the heedlessly hedonistic and materialistic '80s.

At first Thorton Melon (Rodney's character in the movie) seemingly has two altruistic motives for applying to college: 1) personal improvement, and 2) desire to help his only son Jason (Kevin Gordon) succeed, especially when Thorton discovers that Jason is not exactly the epitome of the BMOC. However, once he essentially bribes his way into college by convincing the venally avaricious Dean Martin (he, he) to let him endow the Thorton Melon School of Business Administration, high school dropout Thorton apparently has it made. One might argue that this scenario is implausible, but given universities' insatiable hunger for more cash, I could believe they would bend the rules to let wealthy Thorton in.

Thorton then proceeds to embody every college student's wet dream - to be the perpetually fun-loving slacker who has the dough to show himself and others an endless good time and buy himself out of any trouble! Again, philistine critics may argue that no college would tolerate Thorton's party-boy persona.  Wouldn't the cops arrest him for the voyeuristic female dormitory scene or the out-of-control party scene, instead of merely reprimanding him or bringing Lite beer (remember Rodney was one of the shills for Lite)? However, ""Back to School""'s college satire necessarily must employ a little hyperbole to get its point across.

For example, in the classroom scenes with the history professor (the late Sam Kinison) and the business instructor (Paxton Whitehead), the movie also does go a little over the top but also tweaks college for its well-meaning but unrealistically theoretical approach (i.e. head up its a$$ approach) to working and life. Thornton's take on the corruption and shady dealing it would really take to start a business really does have a germ of truth. Also, the way Thorton ""prepares"" for his classes -his secretary takes notes for him in class and his research team does his reports and homework- is off the wall but also possesses scientific truth. I'm sure that at Tufts and other colleges, some students never went to class and got others to take notes and do reports. However, (and this is one of my favorite scenes from the movie) only Thornton would heft a report created by his research team and crack, ""I dunno; it feels like a ""C""; add some more multicolored graphs""."" And of course only Thornton would hire Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. to appraise his own work.

Nevertheless, ""Back to School"" lets Rodney collide with harsh, poignant reality without sacrificing laughs. Thornton is failing his classes; even the professor most sympathetic to him (Sally Kellerman) suspects him of plagiarism. His son Jason angrily refuses to let Thornton's think tank do his astronomy work. Thornton will be expelled unless he passes a multi-part oral exam (!) by all of his course professors. After a pep talk from Thornton's chauffeur (Burt Young) about Thornton's ""School of Hard Knocks"" life, Jason realizes that just as his dad came to school to show him how to loosen up and enjoy life, he must show his dad how to handle college responsibilities. And isn't that what college is all about - balancing responsibility and fun to have a meaningfully productive experience?

Therefore, ""Back to School"" is more than just an ""Animal House"" retread. It uses Rodney's older, wry perspective (and those priceless one-liners) to point out both the absurdity and importance of college life. Heck, I would even recommend high school seniors applying to colleges to give ""Back to School"" a look if only to show them (with a grain of salt, of course) that while college is a worthwhile experience, it's also a unique, unfamiliar world all its own.",1285286400,4,4126,5.078171091445427

150278,5,0792843991,"What would comedy be without Rodney Dangerfield? After decades of trying to make it big, took his self-depreciating stand-up act of one-liners to new heights in the 1980's & paved the way for thousands of a new generation of comics to do the same. Eventually Hollywood called, and after a noticable bit part (Caddyshack) and a middle-of-the-road starring piece (Easy Money), it was time for Rodney to get the respect he always deserved with what now most consider his greatest film, 1986's Back To School.

Playing Thornton Melon, a successful clothing chain owner, he decides to join his college-going son by enrolling himself, having a grand ole party and fun every step of the way. This was a role tailor made for Dangerfield, and still after all these years is as funny and fresh as ever. However, MGM first released this film in 2000 with a bare-bones edition that at the most would earn it a D+. So seven years later, it now has been given an ""Extracurricular Edition"" that for the most part makes the grade.

First off, the picture has been completely cleaned-up, barely a blemish or speck to be seen all the while with still keeping it's '80's film look. 2000's included a new 5.1 audio mix but now offers the original 2.0 as well for purists. But the main reason to double-dip would be the brand-new-to-DVD extras that fill most of it's second layer. Ranging from 5 to 18 minutes each, there's six new featurettes here discussing the making of the movie, to the styles of the film's signature dive ""The Triple Lindy"", to a very thoughtful looking back of the life of Rodney Dangerfield as told by those who knew him personally (Rodney passed before this version came out in 2004). Each new feature is entertaining, informative and quite a trip to see some of it's actors & crew today, like Harold Ramis, Sally Kellerman, Burt Young (with even a feature about his rise in acting from Rocky to BTS), 80's Blond-Haired Bad Boy William Zabka (yeah, he talks about his career typecasting here...finally!), and as Rodney's son Keith Gordon (wow, he really looks different now!). These are worth the double-dip alone besides the great presentation of the movie it belongs to. Of course it would have been nice to have a commentary track with these people and more stock footage of maybe Rodney himself being interviewed during the time of the film, but MGM did do a pretty good job here and what we got should do quite nicely.

Back To School unfortunately did such a good job for Rodney, that he never made another comedy that came close to it in his career again (No, Natural Born Killers doesn't count...put down that Little Nicky case too).

A great look back at what fun we had at the movies in the 1980's and at a man that always received our respect no matter how many times he said he didn't.

150281,5,0792843991,"In the course of cinematic history, many standup comics have crossed over into films, and most of the films have been truly abysmal.  Even a comic like Richard Pryor, who is considered the best standup of all time, made some of the worst films I've ever seen (like The Toy).  Some will argue about Robin Williams and Bill Murray, but Williams's work is uneven (he's been great in some dramatic films like Good Will Hunting and has done some true crap like RV), and Murray is in another league together, as he is doing much more dramatic work, much more introspective than most comedians would ever dare.  Some of John Belushi's work is very good (notably The Blues Brothers), and Eddie Murphy made a few great films (48 Hours is probably the best), but the most notable exceptions to this rule is Rodney Dangerfield.  Rodney didn't make any cinematic masterpieces like Satantango or Berlin Alexanderplatz, but a good number of his films were hilarious, true to life, and they are still good today.  This is his best work, a consistently hilarious film where he plays a successful, street smart businessman who decides to go back to college to help out his son.  It works so well because Rodney himself is so damn engaging and so likeable one forgets the rather predictable (but still funny) plot.  Dangerfield is my favorite standup comic (a part of the entertainment field that I have to admit I don't really like).  His comedy never became dated (like many comedians), it was never topical, it was always universal, it was never cruel, never crass, never smug (a quality I hate about most modern comics), and his films had these qualities too.  He was just a real guy who never got any respect.  He plays a character like that here.  Despite his character's success, the faculty at the school still looks down on him (except for Sally Kellerman, who kind of loves/likes him).  Dangerfield one liners abound, and the rest of the cast is very engaging as well.  It's a very good picture, Rodney's best and one of the few examples out there of a standup making a pretty damn good film.",1197504000,3,2084,4.676712328767123

150303,5,0792843991,"This is a great movie and fairly tame by 1980s standards.  You might look at this film as a more intellectual version of ANIMAL HOUSE.

This film is a mix of Dangerfield styles.  Essentially we have the family man from EASY MONEY combined with his rich eccentric character from CADDY SHACK.  The story is simple.  Thornton Melon, a hard working self made multi millionaire, visits his son at (the fictional) Grand Lakes University.  There he discovers his son Jason (Keith Gordan) is struggling with college life as well as life in general.  Melon decides to show his son that he can do anything he sets his mind to do.  As such, Melon makes a generous donation to the university and is rewarded with acceptance as a student in the upcoming semester.

Thornton Melon has his own challeges as he is used to having things his own way and eventually realizes that money cannot buy everything. Melon's nemesis is his business science professor Dr. Phillip Barbay.  Melon's real life success and experience in business come into conflict with Barbay's pure academic teachings.  Barbay rejects Melon as a legitimate student while Melon unwisely refuses to at least pretend to respect his professor's teachings.  Adding to the tension is that Melon has eyes for Barbay's girlfriend and peer Dr. Diane Turner (Sally Kellerman). Turner is a woman seeking old fashioned romance and fun, which is something totally alien to Barbay.

Meanwhile Melon's son Jason becomes ever more confused about college.  Though he finally makes it onto the school diving team he wrongly assumes his good fortune is solely due to his father's checkbook.  Jason is also vying for the affections of his nemesis' girlfriend.  By the film's conclusion both men win the affections of their respective love interests, have moved closer as father and son, and emerged from the semester a little smarter.

BACK TO SCHOOL was a belated follow up to Dangerfield's successful EASY MONEY.  Its premier in 1986, a full three years after EASY MONEY, meant that it could not ride the successful wave of its predecessor.  Basically it was a Rodney Dangerfield movie starting from scratch.  The original script called for Dangerfield to come from a somewhat impoverished background thus explaining his street-wise approach to college.  This would have been a better link to his previous character Monty Capuletti.  The screenplay was later changed to make Thornton Melon wealthy.

BACK TO SCHOOL hosts quite a few great performances by actors in minor supporting roles.  Adrienne Barbeau is perfect for her brief but outstanding role as Vanessa Melon.  E. Emmet Walsh (Christmas with the Kranks, Fletch) does a good job as the swim team coach.  Dangerfield protege Sam Kinison has a very memorable role as a history professor.  Let us not forget Ned Beatty as Dean Martin.  Also virtually unrecognizable in the film is actor Robert Picardo (China Beach, Star Trek Voyager) as Gorgio.

One of the questions that is never answered in the movie is when this story takes place.  The younger Melon, while talking to his father from a phone in the locker room, says that it is during a break -- and thus his apologies for not visiting home during break. From the colorful changing leaves we see that the story logically begins in the early autumn.  The exterior shots of the University of Wisconsin also support that the film was lensed in the Fall.  One has to question what sort of lengthy college break takes place in autumn?  The never explained break allows Thornton Melon to enroll as a freshman in time to begin one of the semesters.  Later we see the lush green background by the swimming pool for the scenes shot in southern California.  The bottom line is that Melon's visit and subsequent enrollment timeline is of no consequence to the story.

BACK TO SCHOOL was the last of the great Rodney Dangerfield films.  Although he appeared in various television series episodes and numerous films, his subsquent ""Dangerfield"" films, such as MY FIVE WIVES, THE FOURTH TENOR, THE GODSON, MEET WALLY SPARKS, and LADYBUGS paled in comparison.  Shortly before his death Dangerfield was reportedly involved in preparing a sequel to BACK TO SCHOOL, but it never came to fruition.  Remember that a similar circumstance occurred when Dangerfield was to originally reprise his role in CADDY SHACK II, but was dropped from the project.

The internet abounds with reports about a 21st century remake in the works for BACK TO SCHOOL.  In my opinion they should never tamper with the original.",1190505600,2,4532,4.949668874172185

150309,5,0792843991,"Having recently turned 34, I decided to go back to college.  These last few weeks have brought back memories such as standing in long lines, worrying about financial aid, exorbitant book store prices, finding my way around campus, entrance exams (which can be quite challenging if your math is rusty like mine), and trying to find classes that best suit my work schedule.  All of this has to happen before the first minute is actually spent in class.  Being an older than average college student prompted me to write a review on this comedy classic about a college freshman much older than myself.

The sorely missed Rodney Dangerfield plays Thornton Melon in perhaps his greatest performance ever.  Melon is a wealthy self-made sixty year-old entreprenuer whose massive retail chain specializes in clothes for large men.  What Melon lacks in formal education, he makes up for by being hard-working and having a solid business know-how that is not taught in the economics classes.  Two things happen that bring his life to a crossroads.  First of all, he catches his no-good wife (played with perfect bitchiness by Adrianne Barbeau) making time and a half with another man.  Secondly, his awkward, unhappy son Jason (played by Keith Gordon) calls him to say he wants to drop out of college.  So, what's a rich over the hill fatcat to do?  Enroll at his son's college, what else?

Thornton initially has a good thing going at school with partying, cutting up in class, and lots of beautiful female students.  His wealth and fun-loving personality make him a hit with most of the other students.  He doesn't just throw parties; he IS the party.  His popularity even begins to rub off on Jason - which is a mixed blessing since he wants to succeed at school on his own merits.  But soon his partying and the fact that he has paid consultants to do his homework  illegally begin to catch up with him.

As I mentioned earlier in the review, Rodney was at the top of his game here.  He was cleary having a good time making the movie, and that good time works its way to the viewer.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Paxton Whitehead is perfect as an aloof Economics professor who serves as Thornton's diametrically opposed antagonist.  Robert Downey Jr, an actor who normally annoys me to end, is hilarious as Jason's punked-out diver-heckling best friend.  The late Sam Kinison is especially memorable as a psychotic History professor/Vietnam veteran.  You even have a cameo by Kurt Vonnegut Jr (yes, the same Kurt Vonnegut Jr who wrote _Slaughterhouse Five_).  Back to School is a textbook (bad choice of words) example of how great comedy films used to be before the comedy genre became hijacked by disgustingly unfunny toilet humor mavens like Rob Schneider and bland rom-com chick flicks.

Not only is Back to School great for those times when you just need a good belly laugh, it also has a great message about the importance of both having to work hard and also having a good time.  Thornton was having a hard time with college because he partied too much.  Jason, on the other hand, was unhappy because he worked too hard and didn't take time to smell the roses.  Both of them needed to find a balance. Everyone going to school (college, high school, etc.) should take that lesson to heart. I certainly intend to.",1170201600,6,3322,4.7486910994764395

150330,4,0792843991,"Thornton Melon has a head for business. Even though he never went to college, he took the family tailoring business and transformed it into a chain of successful clothing stores. It's made Thornton (Rodney Dangerfield) a wealthy man who can send his son Jason (Keith Gordon) to the elite Grand Lakes University. Thornton also shares his wealth with his unfaithful second wife, Vanessa (Adrienne Barbeau), who is unsatisfied with the life Thornton's money could bring her. She not only wants his money, but she wants to control Thornton. The last straw between Thornton and Vanessa comes one evening at one of the parties Vanessa insists on throwing, when he catches her in the act of cheating. Not only does he serve her divorce papers, but he shows her photos of her cheating. Both Jason and Thornton's driver, Lou (Burt Young), say how much better a person Thornton's late first wife was.

Thornton uses the divorce to make a trip to Jason's college to visit him. Thornton discovers that Jason's been lying about how well he's been doing in school. Thornton offers this fatherly advice: ""You don't lie to me. You lie to girls."" Jason had claimed he was on the school's diving team when he was only good enough to be the towel boy. When Jason admits he's getting mostly Bs and Cs, Thornton is happy that his son is in some of the top three grades. Thornton decides he'd like to see Jason do better in both academics and athletics, and have some fun in the process. In ""Back To School,"" Thornton decides to go to college with Jason in an effort to not only be with Jason, but also to get a formal education himself.

To get into the college without the benefit of SATs, Thornton makes a deal with Grand Lakes dean David Martin (Ned Beatty) to make a sizeable donation to the university - a business building dedicated to Thornton himself. The actions of Thronton and Dean Martin draw the ire of business professor Philip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), who thinks Thornton's presence undermines the ideals of the university. Thornton further upsets Barbay by taking an interest in English professor Diane Turner (Sally Kellerman), whom he's been dating. Thornton's knowledge of business is merely an extreme distraction to Barbay, who insists on teaching his class how to conduct business legitimately.

Meanwhile, with Thornton's help, Jason makes the diving team. Team captain Chas Osborne (William Zabka) is certain that Jason's father bought Jason a spot on the roster. Coach Turnbull (M. Emmet Walsh), however, is more interested in Thornton's diving experience. Jason also takes an interest in Valerie Desmond (Terry Farrell), a student that Chas also likes. Thornton uses his money to make life as full of ease and fun as possible. However, Thornton takes that too far when he brings his people (and special consultant Kurt Vonnegut, in a cameo appearance) to the school to write papers for himself and Jason. Not only does Jason reject the work, but Barbay also believes Thornton isn't doing the work for class he's been assigned, and demands Dean Martin expel Thornton. Martin, instead, makes Thornton take oral exams with all of his professors. Expulsion awaits if Thornton fails the orals.

""Back To School"" is one of the best college comedies I've seen. It's not quite in the same league as ""Animal House"" or ""Horse Feathers,"" but it's close. The story is filled with Dangerfield one-liners that could easily have been preceded by his trademark line, ""I don't get no respect."" Thornton certainly doesn't get respect from Philip or Vanessa, but they are people who don't like Thornton as a person. Both have issues that involve Thornton's money. Everybody else sees beyond his money and knows him to be a generous, fun-loving businessman. When he's in the bookstore, he not only insists on buying Jason new textbooks, but he announces to the other students, ""It's on me. Shakespeare for everyone."" A host of writers, including Dangerfield on the story and Harold Ramis on the screenplay, maximize the joke potential of every scene. Some of the story is a bit stereotypical, but the film's good nature and consistent humor compensate more than adequately for the stereotypes.

In addition to all of the jokes, the actors make the relationships credible. Thornton may not offer Jason tpyical fatherly advice, but Thornton generally offers advice that is beneficial. Diane first takes notice of Thornton at the campus bookstore, and enjoys his enthusiasm. Philip simply dismisses Thornton as ""the world's oldest living freshman."" It's Philip's stuffiness and dismissiveness that creates trouble between himself and Diane, as well as between himself and Thornton. Dangerfield is not a great actor, but he does well here because the humor is tailored to his comic persona. One of the highlights of his performance is his recitation of Dylan Thomas's famous villanelle, ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,"" and the interpretation of the poem he gives to Diane. In addition to the performers I've already mentioned, three others deserve mention for their comic support. First, Robert Downey, Jr., is hilarious as Derek Lutz, the dormmate of Jason's who puts blue streaks in his hair and stands against any conformity. Sam Kinison is just as funny as Professor Terguson, a history teacher who's not afraid to get sarcastic and loud with his students. His verbal exchange with Thornton is another of the film's best moments. Jason Hervey also makes the most of his brief appearance as young Thornton, doing a good job of copying Dangerfield's mannerisms.

The eighties were a time where Rodney Dangerfield took his brand of comedy to the big screen with great success. College will change Thornton Melon, but not as much as Thornton will change college. He may be one of the oldest people in the school, but his behavior is just like that of the much younger students. ""Back To School"" stands as Dangerfield's biggest achievement on the big screen. He stayed true to his brand of comedy, with very humorous results. He's the regular guy who found his niche in life, and made a fortune as a result. He's also the family man looking to prove a point to his son, as well as to himself. Thornton Melon is a man of means, yet he knows money isn't everything.

What's not to respect about that?

My favorite scenes are: 1) when Dangerfield shows us his Tall & Fat TV ad, 2) when he goes looking for his son, in a female dorm where he 'accidentally' ends up with two peeks at a nude girl taking a shower, 3) where they have Kinison as a disturbed history teacher, making his own comment about the Vietnam war, which was, ""I WISH I COULD BELIEVE IT WAS OVER, BUT I WAS THERE!

The story actually begins in 1940, where young Thornton Meloni (Jason Hervey, who would become famous two years later as Fred Savage's older brother on the TV show ""The Wonder Years"") is being exhorted by his immigrant father to stay in school and not to take over his tailoring business.  The kid ends up not listening to him and becomes a high school dropout, taking over the business and changing it to a ""Tall & Fat Store"" while taking the ""i"" off the end of his last name and making a fortune.  The fifty-something adult Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) is having an awful second marriage to Vanessa (Adrienne Barbeau in full vamp mode), but is proud of his college freshman son Jason (Keith Gordon), whom he thinks is in a popular fraternity and on the school's diving team.  Soon after arriving for a surprise visit, however, Jason admits the truth that he's not in a frat, is not popular and is, in fact,  the 'towel boy' for the diving team.  Jason wants to leave school because it's not going the way he thought it would.  The tall, beautiful Valerie (Terry Farrell) won't even notice him, and his roommate and only friend Derek (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a complete weirdo with wild hairstyles that appear to change daily.  Rich Dad has an idea: he'll enroll as a freshman himself and that will influence Jason to have a better time and to stay in school!
After pulling some strings, including donating a huge sum for a brand-new School of Business (it is, after all, not everyday that a well-respected university will take on a student who never finished high school, even someone as rich as Thornton Melon), fun-loving Thornton proceeds to throw his weight around, changing Jason & Derek's room into a plaza suite (complete with a hot tub), throwing awesome parties and even romancing his English professor (Sally Kellerman), much to the chagrin of her uptight boyfriend, Business professor Phillip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), who would like nothing better than an excuse to drum the impudent Thornton Melon out of the university!  Meanwhile, Thornton uses his considerable influence on Coach Turnbull (M. Emmett Walsh) to let Jason officially join the squad, which upsets the snobby star diver Chas (William Zabka) who suddenly finds himself competing for his girlfriend Terry, who begins to take a liking to Jason.
If this all sounds like too much plot for this 96-minute movie, let me just say that BACK TO SCHOOL makes very efficient use of its time (no slow points here), and equally good use of Mr. Dangerfield's comedic talents, that the plot itself is almost secondary to the one-liners Rodney uses in his usual self-deprecating way.  Plus, the cameos are real fun, especially Kurt Vonnegut Jr. as himself, being hired to write a paper for Jason about--what else?--Kurt Vonnegut Jr.!  The music is very upbeat 80's here (as you would expect for a movie of this type); however, it does mark the film scoring debut for Danny Elfman of Oingo Bongo who appears in the film (as themselves) performing their great classic ""Dead Man's Party"" (which, incidentally, had been on the soundtrack to WEIRD SCIENCE a year earlier).
Even if certain occurrences are patently unbelievable, such as the oral exam scene late in the film, BACK TO SCHOOL is so much fun to watch that it doesn't matter what happens, just as long as Rodney's and Gordon's characters win in the end and make us laugh while doing it.  It is of definite interest to us Star Trek fans that Terry Farrell would eventually go on to play Lt. Dax on TV in ""Deep Space Nine.""  Also, watch quickly for a cameo by Robert Picardo (who would join the aforementioned Jason Hervey two years later in ""The Wonder Years"" playing the dreaded Coach Cutlip, then later on joining Ms. Farrell in the Star Trek series in his wonderful role of the holographic Doctor) as the guy Thornton catches Vanessa fooling around with at a big party.  Oh, and Sam Kinison is hilarious in a small role, playing himself as a shell-shocked History professor who never quite came out of Vietnam.
Everybody is great in this mid-80's comedy classic.  Lastly, you have to love a Rodney Dangerfield movie that features a university dean by the name of Dean Martin (the always-wonderful Ned Beatty).  BACK TO SCHOOL really takes us back to school on what a great film comedy should be.  Add this one to your DVD library! Even with the lack of a lot of extras, it's still very much worth it.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1079654400,14,4712,4.7844827586206895
150356,3,0792843991,"In the mid 1980's, Rodney Dangerfield had a surge of popularity, after starring in hits like CADDYSHACK and EASY MONEY.  BACK TO SCHOOL is arguably his second-best film, in which Dangerfield portrays an obnoxious businessman who goes back to school, with the intentions of helping his discouraged son (Keith Gordon).  There's enough jokes and comedy in here to last the whole film, thus it's very, very entertaining.  Dangerfield is great, displaying a type of charm as he attempts to start a relationship with a Language Arts teacher, played by Sally Kellerman.  The film also marks Danny Elfman's first on-screen appearance.",1063411200,,626,5.23
150357,4,0792843991,"Rodney Dangerfield's follow-up to Easy Money (1983)is as equally funny as said movie. This time he plays Thornton Melon, a self-mad millionaire owner of a chain of Tall and Fat clothing stores. His son, Jason (Keith Gordon), is up at college, living the sweet life... at least in the phone calls home. He only has one friend, the campus weirdo (Robert Downey, Jr.), and is the lowly towel boy for the swim team. After a divorce with his shallow second wife (involving pictures of her with the butler and a midget), he comes up to the college, and winds up enrolling as the world's oldest freshman. He helps make college life fun for his friends, and winds uop ticking off his finance professor by stealing his poetry professor girlfriend (Sally Kellerman), who vows to make college life a living hell. Can Thornton make it by, even with the trouble he lands in?
A good, solid comedy with great performances all around, the best by Dangerfield, Kellerman, Gordon, Downey Jr, and Sam Kinison as a crazed vietnam vet-turned-history professor(according to Thornton, ""He's a good teacher. He really cares.... about what, I'll never know."") The disc gives you a choic between widescreen and full frame presentations of the film, bot with good video, with little to no grain present. The sound is presented in Dolby Surround 2.0, and sounds great. the only feature is the trailer (in full-frame), and this is a title that screams SPECIAL EDITION. Where is it?

150358,4,0792843991,"Back to School Rodney Dangerfield's best movie since Caddyshack. He plays Thornton Melon, a high school dropout who owns a chain of suit stores called Tall and Fat. After splitting from yet another wife, he goes to visit his only son at college. He finds out when he gets there that his son has been lying to him about where he lives on campus, his grades and his status on the dive team. He decides to join his son at school and truly turns the campus upside down. He turns their dorm room into a palace, makes registering for classes a breeze and dates a professor. His number one adversary is the uptight Dr. Barbay, his Econ. professor who does not like the fact that Melon bought his way in by donating a building. Meanwhile his son is battling super-jock Chas for the affections of Melanie.

There are lots of great moments, and characters, in this movie, one is Dangerfield's confrontation with his American History professor, the late, great Sam Kinison.  Even though there aren't any extra features, the DVD is worth it. This movie will make you laugh time and time again.",1042934400,2,1081,4.595854922279793
150359,4,0792843991,"Rodney delivers the goods here.  I mean, let's face it, he was the ONLY reason to watch Caddyshack.  He is one doggone funny guy.  The one liners here are great and there are plenty of 'em.  Plus you get to see Robert Downey Jr. in an early role as a wigged out college guy (now that he's a, you know, very conservative adult, catch this movie to see how much he's really changed).
Yeah, OK, so maybe it's not exactly credible that a gorgeous babe like Sally Kellerman would fall for a goofy overweight guy like Rodney, but then again, he's loaded. And what babe would turn down a loaded guy, even if he's chunky?  But he shows a lot of heart here which is what makes this work.
Rodney (Thurman Melon, short for Meloni--I guess he didn't want to reveal his Italian ancestry) never finished college--actually, he never went to college.  So he accepts a challenge from his college-age son to go to the same school his son attends to show how hard it is--or isn't.  We find out that Thruman was a diving champ in high school and he gets to prove it in the story.  Plus he belts out a great rendition of Twist and Shout.
You also get to see Oingo Boingo when they were at the top of their game do a few numbers.  (For those of you unfamiliar, they were a great party rock band from the mid-80s to the early 90s.) Thurman is married to catwoman Adrienne Barbeau who, despite her obvious, shall we say, endowments, is mean-spirited (Rodney loves to have a mean-spirited woman in his flicks; check out Geraldine Fitzgerald in Easy Money).  But she fools around once too many times and the marriage is bust.
Off to school Rodney (uh, I mean Thurman) goes which is where he meets Sally Kellerman's English professor with whom he's smitten immediately.
It's predictable, but a lot of fun.  Rodney is one of the very few guys around who really makes me laugh.  Pretty hard thing to accomplish, but he does the job.  So if you're feeling low, stick this in your DVD player and for at least 90 minutes or so you can relax and laugh a lot.",1042243200,4,2025,4.368
150360,5,0792843991,This is one of those movies I can watch every six months because of the great humor and story Dangerfield stars in.  Dangerfield goes back to college to be closer to his son and the funny one-liners and humor really come together in this funny and intriguing comedy.  I also enjoyed Dangerfield's acting in which he has to earn the respect of his son at school and how he cares about father-and-son issues.  I think Dangerfield is at his best here and it's unfortunate we haven't seen another film like this from him and I simply have to call this film a comedy classic!,1032652800,21,570,4.461538461538462
150361,5,0792843991,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. It isn't as 'dumb-hilarious' like Austin Powers, but it is hilarious.
Here's an overview:
Mr. Mellon (Rodney Dangerfield) owns a 'Big and Fat' store. His son goes to college, however, he tells his dad that he is going to drop out. Mr. Mellon is distressed and says, ""I'll do it with you."" Mr. Mellon has a personality that is hilarious. He keeps giving things away, and gives money away too. He also gets in trouble with the professors. See the movie to see how it ends.
Now I had a very dull description of what was actually going on in the movie. Rodney Dangerfield is absolutely hillarious. This is a must see movie.",1009929600,,655,4.559322033898305
150372,5,0792843991,"This is one of those movies. Everything is good about it, I love Rodney because as an actor you get the feeling that's really him. I have seen this movie literatly dozens of times. There are so many funny moments, it's not even funny. Rodney is great, he's rude, he's funny, he's loud but hay, he's Rodney! That is what makes him so charming. The story here is actually pretty good, when you look past the obvious humor.  You have Rodney trying to get close to his son, which doesn't seem to work well, well because he's obnoxious and too care free. Where his son is focused and serious. I think the chemistry between them is a thing of beauty.  There are moments where you almost believe they are father and son, and moments where you feel the son's embarrassment of his ""pops"" Lots of slapstick here, there's not really much bad langauge, and only about 1 second of nudity. I wouldn't say it's the best movie for kids, but I would have no problem letting my kids watch it. Lou, Rodney's limo driver, and body guard is WONDERFUL! Some of his lines blow me away
""your fathers tough, but a good guy. Like me, I'm good but I'm tough. I put one of my kids through college, and I put the other threw a wall"" haha priceless. This is a must own for everyone if you ask me. As Thorten Mellon Rodney shines, I can't get enough of this movie.",999388800,3,1333,4.306772908366534
150373,5,0792843991,"Don't you just miss 80's movies like Back To School?  A film starring one of the funniest men on the planet (Mr. Rodney Dangerfield) with an ensemble cast of famous names unto themselves, has got to have SMASH MOVIE written all over it, and it does!  A simple premise: Thornton Melon (Dangerfield) has become a wealthy millionaire even though he dropped out of high school, and now his son, Jason (Keith Gordon) wants to drop out of college, so in order to keep him from leaving, Thornton decides to go to college too!  There are so many hysterical moments I just can't print them all.  But some favorites are the big scene with Sam Kinison as the crazed history teacher, Professor Terguson (""Good teacher.  He really seems to care.  About what I have no idea"".), Thornton doing the Triple Lindey swimming dive  (with Derek[Robert Downey Jr.]distracting the rival diving team with loud noise and reflecting light to the face), Thornton's rendition of ""Twist And Shout"" at a local bar, and of course, the party in Thornton's dorm room, with Danny Elfman's band, Oingo Boingo and a killer hot tub, complete with BUBBLES! (""Now that's what I call marine biology"".)  But a truly winning comedy can't be completely great without heart, which is what this film has.  Keith Gordon (John Carpenter's Christine), who is sorely missed in the acting world since he changed his profession to directing, is great as Thornton's son, Jason, who loves his father a lot but feels like Dad's always trying to do too much to make him happy when all he wants to do is live his own life.  Terry Farrell (TVs Star Trek: DS9 & Becker) makes a good love interest for him too.  I always knew she'd make a name for herself one day.  Of course you can't make this sort of film without the bad guys and both father and son have each of their own: William Zabka (who we all should remember as bad boy Johnnie from The Karate Kid) as Chas, the snotty swim diver, and Paxton Whitehead as Philip Barbay, Thornton's economics professor are both out to give our duo a not so sweet time at college.  But with Sally Kellerman as the funloving literature teacher, Diane, helping Thornton with reading (and biology) just made things a whole lot more fun.  This film has such a great mix of comic chemistry and one-liners that you may miss after the first viewing from laughing so hard.  But it's also a movie that just makes you feel good when it's all over.
The DVD isn't much on special features, only a trailer, which has a scene not in the film of Thornton and his bodyguard, Lou (Burt Young of the ""Rocky"" movies as Paulie) looking at a college sex book (""Well, they left out the most important thing...where to get it"").  But at least they give you a letterboxed version (1.85:1) as well as a full framed version.  But for the asking price, this disc is worth it.  Maybe someday they'll get the gang together and make a documentary and audio commentary.  Until then get this DVD.  I haven't seen the picture look this good in years.  The VHS pales in comparison.
So, if you're tired of all the bland humor that seems to be coming out of the Hollywood machine these days, go Back To School with Rodney Dangerfield, who will show you just how funny Comedies should be.  ""Ooh, I'd love to tame your shrew!""",991699200,10,3271,4.555555555555555
