5932553,5,B00EPFEVUG,"The documentary wasn't very long and it wasn't like I expected because it was more talking than showing us
stuff like her singing or even talking about her life on the road. It was actually entertaining though I really loved
it besides those problems. She did rap and sing songs that we haven't heard before.
Ariana was also in interviews with people such as Big Boy and others.",1388534400,6,378,4.573529411764706
5932554,2,B00EPFEVUG,"The narrator in this video mispronounces Ariana's last name.  The video is simply made up of three interviews that can already be viewed on the internet (e.g., Youtube).  Nothing new, nothing special.  A bit of a disappointment.",1388361600,3,228,5.108108108108108
5932555,1,B00EPFEVUG,"I bought this for my daughter and she was so disappointed. It was filled with interviews readily available online that she had already seen. Worst of all, the narrator pronounced her name Grand the whole way through. I can't believe they produced this and put it on the shelves with such a glaring error. I am really not happy with this purchase. At all.",1388016000,3,354,4.546875
5932556,1,B00EPFEVUG,"This DVD is ONLY a few live radio You Tube interviews (you can watch for free).  The narrator (ON PURPOSE) says her name incorrectly which one can only assume it is an Ariana unauthorized DVD.  By saying her name incorrectly there are no copyright or trademark issues.  You are simply watching You Tube radio interviews with terrible narration.  IF you have a CRAZY Ariana fan it may not even be an issue and you can get through it with no sever dissapointment.
ONE MORE THING!  They show Ariana swearing (beeped out) and also the radio DJ's swear and even drop the F-Bomb with NO filter or bleeping out.  So if you want your 9-year old to watch this they are going to be schooled in some serious vulgar language.",1388016000,3,713,4.488372093023256
5932557,2,B00EPFEVUG,I thought this would be a great present for my Ariana grande lover but we watched it together and it's basically a bunch of really long interviews that are super boring. Wasn't impressed and did not share much about her life at all.,1387929600,2,232,4.4186046511627906
5932558,1,B00EPFEVUG,I would rather see Sam & Cat than to see this stupid interview. The narrater totally sucked.. Pronounce Grande's name wrongly.,1387584000,4,126,5.0476190476190474
5932559,1,B00EPFEVUG,It is only a compilation of interviews my daughter had already seen.  The narrator didn't even pronounce Ariana's name correctly!!  It was terrible.,1386979200,8,148,5.391304347826087
8607914,1,B00EPFEVUG,This is an unauthorized publication.,1511049600,,36,6.4
8607915,5,B00EPFEVUG,"I had already been a fan of Ariana Grande for over two years when I bought this last December. I was wondering what it would be like, what kind of clips or stories about Grande. would be on this disk? I liked this  movie because it traces a path in her career. This movie is old: Ariana hadn't even released her first album at the time it was made, but it doesn't just throw together entertaining videos and clips like some of these behind-the-scenes movies do. We see interviews from different points in her career leading up to the release of her first single ""The Way"". The interviews and clips we saw were actually real. We watched some of Ariana's experiences in the starting days in her life as a music artist. Ariana was really sweet back then, and she still is. She's always beautiful. Great movie because we don't just see random slips, we see a path of her experiences.",1453939200,,879,4.459627329192546
8607916,5,B00EPFEVUG,its good just wished you would have pronounced her name correct! its nothing special but i recommend for the arianators who love to collect all her merchandise like me!,1423785600,,168,4.827586206896552
8607917,1,B00EPFEVUG,"This is nothing more than pieced together interviews that aren't even very good. Do not waste your money. The narrator doesn't even pronounce her name right...through the entire boring mess. That being said, the girl isn't very interesting to begin with.",1410480000,4,254,5.219512195121951
8607918,1,B00EPFEVUG,Not a good purchase...my daughter was disappointed and gave it away,1407801600,3,67,5.181818181818182
8607919,1,B00EPFEVUG,"I am not a saint - I definitely use terrible language at times; however, the cursing on this was terrible.  You have to think about your target audience!  Mostly children...my daughter and her friends (ages 9-11) said they thought the video was boring.  It's a shame because there is not a lot of Ariana Grande things to purchase for my daughter.",1400284800,4,346,4.639344262295082
8607920,5,B00EPFEVUG,Just a lot of interviews but still good but I expected like childhood pics and growing up but not what was given,1394409600,3,112,4.136363636363637
8607921,3,B00EPFEVUG,Case arrived cracked but DVD is fine.  Not so much her life story but pieces of videos that mostly can be viewed elsewhere.  Warning about some not so great language if its for a younger viewer.,1391731200,2,194,4.361111111111111
8607922,5,B00EPFEVUG,"If you're a fan of Ariana Grande, you will want to own this DVD.
Gives a nice behind the scenes look into one of the most fastest rising stars in the music industry.",1390608000,4,165,4.03030303030303
8607923,4,B00EPFEVUG,"It was a christmas gift for a little girl...and she loved it. I just wish the video had more into her personal life, rather than just interviews.",1388793600,4,145,4.407407407407407
