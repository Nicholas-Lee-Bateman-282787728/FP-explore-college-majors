4497715,5,B004XWGYZG,"This is a great peek at the man who was Gregory Peck.  It offers a fascinating glimpse of how he viewed his career when he did his one-man show.  Then you see the family man and view his life off camera.  It shows that he was a dying breed:  a man who truly was a gentleman, who had impeccable manners, dressed well, loved his wife and his family.  He was someone who wasn't affected by his fame and viewed his acting as a craft.  The fact that he was able to make lots of money doing that also afforded him the ability to provide a great lifestyle to his family.  Interestingly enough, his kids were raised ""normal"" vs. in ""Hollywood style"" and this is thanks to both his wife and him who seemed both to have a grounded self-esteem about themselves.  Many of today's actors should take a lesson from Gregory Peck on how to live/work in Hollywood and perhaps they all wouldn't be married 8 times with children who can't keep track of who their father or mother is.",1315785600,12,964,4.316666666666666
8447533,5,B004XWGYZG,"I saw this loving portrait of the remarkable and beloved Gregory Peck last night,and of course I now HAVE to own it.  He is a most admired movie star, and seeing him in this informal setting involving Q&A's, I am an even more ardent fan.  Beautiful production.  Congratulations to all involved, and thanks too.",1504396800,,310,4.703703703703703

8447537,5,B004XWGYZG,"This is a sensitive and heartfelt portrait of an American icon, the likes of whom we are unlikely to see again. I really loved this documentary. Highly recommended!",1463788800,2,164,4.892857142857143
8447538,5,B004XWGYZG,"This is more than a bio-pic of one of Hollywood's greatest movie stars.  It is a glimpse into the life of an actor who found his success without being a slave to the box office, choosing meaningful roles, often shunning the more lucrative route.  Apart from the public movie star, this documentary also offers down-to-earth insights into one man's life, its struggles, hearthaches, joys, and the role of family.
  Built on a series of ""Conversations"" in which the actor tells stories, screens clips, and answers questions from the audiences across America, this film succeeds in painting a rich portrait of all that Gregory Peck was and is.",1427500800,4,640,4.953271028037383

8447540,4,B004XWGYZG,"THE FILM IS REMARKABLE FOR FRAMING THE END CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE. ALTHOUGH HE WAS UP IN AGE WHEN IT WAS FILMED, IT IS A REMARKABLE TESTAMENT TO BOTH HIS INTELLECTUAL ACUITY AND SOLID VALUES.",1393891200,5,188,4.4
8447541,5,B004XWGYZG,"I absolutely loved this documentary - a mix of anectotes from the past told by the man himself, 'behind the scenes' with his family, his answers to questions from the audiences of his tour (hilarious!), interviews and movie clips.... and very moving end, when he explains what he would like to be remembered for.... a must see for every Gregory Peck fan!",1379808000,5,354,4.725806451612903
8447542,3,B004XWGYZG,"I had previously seen this documentary on TV and enjoyed it thoroughly which is what prompted me to buy it as a gift for someone who is a big Gregory Peck fan. A while later, however, I found out that the DVD was actually defective and would not play at all! Unfortunately, I received this news too late to orchestrate a return (the return window had closed). So, if you do choose to purchase this product (which happens to be a very enjoyable look into the life of a great actor), I would encourage you to try out the DVD soon after you receive it, in case you encounter the same problem.",1362009600,6,589,4.267857142857143
