I didn't  know what to expect from this movie and I was wonderfully surprised by the wonderful directorial work of Diego Luna, I was born and raised in Aguascalientes so the references and pictures of the temple of temple of the Purisima (where I grow up) kept me interested and kept me watching.
It's a movie dealing with the topic of mental health and totally worth watching, wonderful directorial  work and acting!
Bravo Diego!! 5 stars worth!!",1504483200,,466,4.7407407407407405

8501297,5,B006NA0IHQ,"Abel returns to the family home after two years in hospital for an undisclosed mental health problem which has rendered him silent. He is nine years old, and doesn't know what his role is in the family, until he finds an old family photograph and realises what the family in the photo had that the family he has encountered upon his homecoming does not have. It does not have a father. Christopher Ruiz-Esparza, as Abel, delivers a subtle but powerful portrayal of a boy locked in to himself who is desperately trying to find a role that will help him make sense of his life. Diego Luna gets as captivating and mature a performance out of him and his real life younger brother Gerardo as Michael Winterbottom did from his sibling child actors in the film 'Everyday'. A remarkable and disturbing film all round.",1411257600,,810,4.631944444444445

8501299,3,B006NA0IHQ,"I couldn't get through this. Perhaps it's my own personal bias, but I have a very difficult time watching children boss adults around, especially their parents. I couldn't stomach that. It's very slow moving. Some folks will like it. It's a creative endeavor & I give credit for that. You'll have to watch it to see what how you feel about it. I hate rating things & especially judging someone else's creative work, so I will give it three stars.",1358208000,,446,4.5875
8501300,4,B006NA0IHQ,"A spectacle for the eye with its color mixing and influence from Mexican film culture. Love the time period portrayed, scenery, art direction, and lighting--it's all a bit extreme but somewhat captures the essence of Mexican cinema. An interesting film overall.",1342742400,,261,5.390243902439025
