4171671,2,B003QR2SRC,"A really homely, epileptic, emotionally mute girl spends her spring break with mom and a friend in her hometown. She goes to a few parties where other homely girls congregate. Her boyfriend breaks up with her but she doesn't say anything. It's a fine line between trying to show the inner emotions of someone without dramatic dialogue and showing that someone is emotionally dysfunctional. This one veers too far toward the latter.

Also, the dialogue between the characters makes them seem like Middle School students, not college. I mean, this guy tells his friend that he's been hanging out with this girl for a few months and he thinks he ""likes"" her and they almost kissed... but not quite. How old are these people? It's very hard to feel empathy towards these do-nothing characters. They are boring. To live an entire sexless week with these people in which no one has any conversation of meaning or depth... is truly, sadly average.",1294012800,,940,4.838509316770186

4171674,2,B003QR2SRC,Some unexceptional people spend most of the movie talking about their relationships and some trival matters. That's about it.,1283644800,4,125,5.631578947368421
4171675,5,B003QR2SRC,"As a snapshot of NY, the protagonist at film's center and the myriad ways she negotiates daily life, this ""Girl"" is every bit as relevant as Lena Dunham's amazing show of the same name. If only there were room in people's hearts for art that favors the cerebral over exuberance. If you have a twenty-something daughter/friend/sister in your life who's making the move to the big city, I can think of no better film to pair with Ms. Dunham's breakout show than Mr. Grey's excellent THE EXPLODING GIRL. This is American cinema at its finest.",1360627200,2,539,4.684210526315789
4171676,4,B003QR2SRC,"This film deserves more than 4 stars, maybe 4.75. It was surprisingly engaging, and the right length. One very moving scene has no dialogue, just a closeup of people's hands. So much is said in this scene without words. The human hand is extremely expressive. That scene reminded me of a similar scene in Kieslowski's ""A Short Film about Love""(extended version). I hope Exploding Girl's director makes equally good films for me to enjoy in the future.",1355616000,,451,4.87012987012987

4171678,4,B003QR2SRC,"I kept thinking there was more to come.  The movie was low-key and slow paced.  I'm OK with that.  I watch international movies and many movies from other countries are like that.  But, I thought that the character development left something to be desired.  I didn't know the characters any better at the end than I did at the beginning.",1351036800,,337,4.55
4171679,5,B003QR2SRC,"Exploding Girl starring Zoe Kazan may not make everyone feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Some people might think this film is boring and that nothing significant happens to Ivy (Kazan) or that they might think this film tries too hard to be current or hip. The thing I take away from Exploding Girl is that this is a story of a young College girl who feels alone and out of place in the world and somewhow I can relate to that which makes this a memorable film to me. I've seen Zoe Kazan in a few films prior to this one, I never really took a strong interest in her before but after watching this film, I think it is very obvious that Kazan is an exceptional, gifted actress. Her character Ivy suffers from seizures and her relationship with her boyfriend Greg is on the verge of collapse whom she communicates with via cell phone. I like her friend Al and how their friendship takes an unexpected turn at the end of the film, it's beautiful and subtle and oh so realistic! I love this film, it's my own secret treasure! It might not move everyone but it moved me.",1332288000,2,1064,4.298507462686567
4171680,5,B003QR2SRC,"I have always admired indie films because I feel like there is something to gain from them that you won't gain from your typical film. While I will admit I have seen some that seem completely pointless, I have also considered the fact that some of these films have forced me to look at its content through a different kind of lense and to see the world from the characters perspective. The Exploding Girl in particular was one of the more interesting indie films I have seen recently. Ivy's character seemed slightly lost in her world yet still has a strong sense of identity; she is a character I could closely relate to and I can see how many people in high school and college could appreciate this film because it strongly focuses on understanding and accepting oneself. It also has a romantic side and shows how apathetic people can be in their relationships early on in life. The film quality is very artsy and colorful which in my opinion, draws in the auidence and gives the film much more character. I ordered it off of Amazon and was very satisfied with the packaging of the DVD. According to the box, 80% of it is made out of recycled materials (I've always been a big supporter of eco friendly things). The Exploding Girl is a film I am more than happy to add to my DVD collection.",1325548800,6,1292,4.455696202531645
4171681,5,B003QR2SRC,"A short, yet slow film, that obviously isn't for everyone, but, for those who it *is* for, those who'll enjoy this ultra low-budget examination of friendship and romance, for us, it's like bittersweet candy. Ivy, played by the beautiful Zoe Kazan, has epilepsy(The name, Exploding Girl is a double entendre, for one, she has epilepsy, shown in one scene to heart-breaking effect, and also in regards for her angst and ennui regarding her relationships and confusions with them.) Her friend Al, played by Mark Rendall(Who really should be in more and more movies, he seems like a star in my opinion.) is staying at her place during a break in College(I think Spring Break, but I'm honestly not sure.) But over the course of this 80 minute film, Ivy goes back and forth emotionally with a boyfriend she only hears of in brief, uneventful phone calls that mirror the phone conversations we have in real life, we attempt to have long, rich conversations through a hand-held device, yet end up saying ""good-bye"" before anything of use or wealth is said. The fact that the film unfolds slowly, and feels slow, and yet only lasts 80 minutes is a toast to the writing and performances. Some will say its boring because of this, but to me, it was just about as realistic as you could get, and very fun and heart-warming to see these events play out the way they did, because, in real life, relationships don't get kick-started with a jolt of energy like they do in most movies, they take a lot of time and a lot of missed opportunities and seemingly lost chances and inhibitions. To me, this film was just about perfect. Its what I love in modern independent film-making, short, cheap, to the point, effective, lovely, and sweet. Whilst also being true. And if you are the kind to be able to sit through a movie like this, the ending will definitely pay off for you. But for those unaware of what they're getting into, expecting a John Hughes romance, you're not gonna get it. But, as said before, if this is what you want, what you're looking for, then seek no more, you've found it!",1312761600,2,2075,4.610810810810811
4171682,2,B003QR2SRC,"This film is fairly recent. It was very hard for me to finish watching it on account of how slow the pacing of the film was. Ivy and her friend Al come home for summer break. They hang out, go to a few meaningless boring parties, and talk. Ivy has a few epileptic episodes. Her boyfriend breaks up with her over the phone. Her mother is always working at the dance studio. ""Hey.....Hey.....Hey....Hey, ok bye"" composes the majority of her phone conversations. Ivy is basically limited on things to do and people to do them with. Her life over the summer had been so boring to the point where she actually wanted to EXPLODE. They best thing that came from Ivy's break was her new relationship with her friend Al. Unfortunately, I think many girls can relate to the character of Ivy. A lot of white college kids are really sheltered and don't do anything. Ivy's life is a sad example of that.",1310601600,,890,4.466257668711656
4171683,5,B003QR2SRC,A very successful film that shows a few days in the life of a college girl on spring break.  The film tells its story between the lines of dialogue and reveals the highs and lows of life without ever breaking a sweat.,1301961600,,217,4.166666666666667
4171684,1,B003QR2SRC,"I'm willing to suspend a lot of my criticism for microbudget films as they are the purest form of filmmaking.  But the film then needs to have a very strong story or message.  I just didn't see that message anywhere and the story wasn't strong enough to be anything worth making a movie about.  This microbudget film was so full of potential as the premise lays the ground for something really good, but it completely falls flat.  It's like the writers had these good characters and a good situation to put them in, and then didn't do anything with them.  As a viewer, it felt like after the writer put together the initial premise, the writer just quit.  But they shot it anyway for some reason even though they didn't have a script or any ideas.

I thought the cinematography was terrible with one or two exceptions which were nice moments.  But cinematography is reinforced by editing and that is another point of failure.  I know those are harsh comments, but if a viewer is going to pay money and spent two hours to see something, make it a worthwhile experience.  No bad cinematographers have a right to shoot movies simply because they own or know how to operate a camera.  And all editors should know that if you don't have enough material, go back to the director and tell them to shoot more.  Don't just ""make it work"" with what you have and call it a movie.  At that point, it's a high school project.

I'm a filmmaker, photographer and editor.  So I look at movies differently than my friends.  But I don't see too many reasons for this movie to be made or funded.  I would have done another few months of tweaking the script and then would have spent much longer shooting it.  Great shots can be few and far between if you don't have a full crew or an ASC certified DP.  This DP was able to get a few nice shots on that rooftop, but they were edited together poorly.  Yeah, the light was failing and you only had a few minutes, but go the next day and the next if you need to.  Exploit the scenery and force those actors to act.

DP and editing problems aside, the movie ended with me thinking, ""That's it?  I feel ripped off.""  This movie gets one star for getting a distribution deal and one star for getting me to watch it (good premise, good cover art, good trailer, good title).  Then it loses a star for failing to properly exploit that rooftop scene.  It loses another star for terrible acting and directing and editing.  Overall rating should be zero stars, but I give it 1 star because I have to give it something.",1300492800,,2536,4.386266094420601

8402464,4,B003QR2SRC,"This movie was designed to be a portrait of a girl and as such does not have much plot. Basically, Ivy comes home for spring break and at the end of spring break goes back to school and not much happens in between.  I'm not into art musiums.  I look at a picture for a few seconds, say ""Huh"" to myself, and move onto the next one.  In this case, however, you are watching Zoe Kazan, who is a brilliant emotionally expressive actress.  Without her, I would have been bored to tears.  If you like thick plots, don't bother to watch.  If you are impressed by Zoe Kazan's artistry you'll be glad you took a look.",1468022400,3,608,4.198275862068965

8402468,4,B003QR2SRC,"This is slow paced but beautiful movie.  It's a tender and sweet coming of age story.  Zoe Kazan is the glue that holds the movie together, with the very realistic angst and turmoil she feels as a college student who is struggling with juggling her life as a college student, her health issues of epilepsy and a boyfriend whom she is trying to stay attached to while she and he are apart on spring break.  In some ways there is a real beauty in the slow, more real life type pace the movie reflects, the lack of big giant exciting moments in the movie, instead show the real life struggle of dealing with the day to day.  This movie is so un-Hollywood in it's shooting.  I also think Zoe Kazan's character as Ivy shows the very real side of life in that Ivy is dealing with an illness, epilepsy, that is scary at times and she isn't the bravest soul who just shrugs it off, but has to cope with balancing this in her life, which is very true for millions of people who have things like severe asthma, epilepsy or dozens of other illnesses that effect the choices they make.  This is a really poignant film that is more reflective of a true coming of age story, and it shows what a really good actress Zoe Kazan was right at the outset of her career.",1425168000,2,1249,4.271186440677966

8402470,4,B003QR2SRC,"The Exploding Girl (2009) is an independent film written and directed by Bradley Rust Gray.

Ivy (Zoe Kazan) is a college student who returns back home to Brooklyn for summer break. Her kind-natured childhood friend, Al (Mark Rendall), needs a place to stay over the summer and rooms with Ivy and her mother. As the summer progresses Ivy's increasingly disinterested boyfriend, Greg, ends their relationship via cellphone. Ivy's a sensitive soul struggling with epilepsy, keeping her emotions wrapped up tightly inside. Her faithful friend, Al, reaches out as Ivy sinks into despair. Will Ivy reach back? Will romance spark?

The Exploding Girl is a sweet, little film which explores the angst of young love. Zoe Kazan, the granddaughter of legendary film director, Elia Kaza, gives a wonderfully touching performance. Rendall does a nice job as Ivy's good-hearted friend. Eric Lin's cinematography is exquisite. The pigeon scene near the end of this film is clearly an homage to Zoe's grandfather's masterpiece, On the Waterfront.

Thank God for independent filmmakers. You'll never see a movie like The Exploding Girl from Hollywood.",1366416000,2,1135,5.329608938547486
