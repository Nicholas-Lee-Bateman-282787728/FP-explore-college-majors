8613941,4,B00FAY7F2W,"OUTSTANDING INTERPRETATION, PERFORMANCE, AND AUDIO-VISUAL CAPTURE!

Riccardo Chailly conducts a brilliant performance, with a magnificent sounding Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6. Sound and video quality are comparable with the very best DVD's of the 6th, including Abbado's with The Lucerne Festival Orchestra (which, incidentally, is a very fine performance in its own right). I recommend your obtaining a copy of either, or both, DVD's. You won't be disappointed  I promise.

The most recent Mahler-ologists' (sic) research holds that the Andante movement be performed 2d in order of performance, while the Scherzo, which, up until 2010 was performed second, is now third in order of performance. The Finale (thankfully) remains last in order. In sum, the 4 movements of Symphony No. 6 are: Mvt. 1 Allegro energico; Mvt. 2 Andante; Mvt. 3 Wuchtig; and, Mvt. 4 Finale Allegro Moderato. Many listeners will still prefer the older order with the Andante Mvt. performed 3rd. I might have cast my lot with the former arrangement of movements, but as I have listened to more performances, such as this one, in which the Andante is second, I am now convinced that the newer order of performance is preferable, and I'll give my reasons why that is so.

Background. I first heard Mahler #6 in 1968, performed by the New Philharmonia Orchestra, Sir John Barbirolli conducting, a boxed set of 2 LP records from EMI Angel Records. I was relatively new to Mahler's music at the time, but I had previously bought No. 7 (New York Philharmonic Leonard Bernstein) which I adored; and, Nos. 1 & 2, both making deep impressions on my young imagination. No. 6 blew me away, and profoundly affected my own growth as a musician and performer. I wanted to play Mahler in symphony orchestra for real, and I did!

I wasn't wholly content with the 6th as issued by EMI, however, the problem being the Scherzo immediately following the 1st Movement. It seemed quite odd to me, given that both movements had recurring strong march rhythms at their foundations, to play them in succession. I never fully embraced the work with, I felt, a discrepancy in the order. Only very recently I learned that it was not Barbirolli's intention to place the Andante second, but EMI's editors who made the change without consulting Barbirolli.

What difference does it make in which order the movements are played? Mahler himself went back and forth about the question. It is not a minor matter which precedes which, I believe, because, put 3rd the Andante takes on a greater prominence in context of the entire work than it ought to have. It also tempts a listener to turn the Andante into a kind of sentimental escape from the darkness in the other three movements, or, a deepened sense of the Andantes tragic significance. The symphony as a whole is composed in the traditional Sonata Allegro form, which consists of a fast tempo in movement one, slow number two, third another fast movement, and, generally, a fast, or fast with slow introductory section, for the final movement. In the 6th Symphony, if the slow movement is positioned 3rd in order, it is easy to discern great beauty, hope, and love, which then will be crushed by the overwhelming weight of the last movement: a tragic"" ending to a tragic symphony. Placed 2d the Andante is no longer in the position to experience symptomatic relief from the darkness and mystery of movements one and two, combined. It is not indicated by the qualities inherent in the music  the notes, or structure  is transcendent, nor is there beauty other than for its own sake. The movement in reality provides little else but cold comfort, when performed more straightforwardly, lacking the sentimental underlining which a conductor might stress, I think, erroneously. I'm not suggesting that the Andante should be interpreted as expressionless or emotion free. Instead, it could be more easily flowing and tranquil in feeling, an expression of love and beauty dimmed by the enclosing darkness of the 1st and 3rd movements.

Counterpoint to the beauty and tranquility, the almost menacing major-to-minor sense underlies the thematic line. In addition, some of the most dissonant chord progressions Mahler, or any other 20th Century composer, wrote at that time. Mahler might not so much have been expressing himself as *being* himself, in the most transparent and available way he knew how, being the modernist he almost certainly was. He might have been aware of how it could throw off conductors and orchestras, as well as listeners, who might not expect such candid self-disclosure, anti-cathartic replacing total release.

But, Mahler was quite up to composing music that shocked and threw into confusion, his friends and his enemies, alike, at that moment of his life. His vulnerability to doubt and disappointment for the way his personal spiritual quest, for redemption, had already diminished to the point of his despairing the quest would fall short of its goal. The composer was healthy, vigorous, and productive. As far as anybody knew, the man and composer were flourishing that summer when Symphony No. 6 was in progress. Below the surface, Mahler's psyche was suffering, his seeming super strength and power beginning to fail him. Time was clearly running out for a glorious end to his spiritual journey.

Tragic is an apt characterization for the 6th, but maybe not the way we might imagine. The opening march of the 7th Symphony, which Mahler started composing even as he was completing the 6th, is tortured, hectoring, and very dark. Possibly, the 6th was, in a way preparation for its successor, No. 7.

I give Chailly's performance highest marks, even if he might not get it all down perfectly. Few if any conductors do get it all, which is a further example why enjoying this most magnificent work, however troubled or tragic, should come easily to the dedicated Mahler devotee, and enthusiastic fan, alike.",1430092800,2,5963,5.012121212121212
8613942,5,B00FAY7F2W,"One of the best interpretations of Mahler in the 21st century. I have not heard better. The sound and picture quality are first rate. As one reviewer put it Riccardo Chailly is turning Leipzig into 'Mahlerville'. Be sure to watch the bonus feature which will explain differences you will encounter from almost all other interpretations. Without it I was a little confused by this interpretation. All in all, this Blu-Ray was a bargain considering the number of times I have listened to it. You would do well to spring for this 6th. It is marvelous.",1428105600,,548,4.778947368421052
8613943,5,B00FAY7F2W,"A magnificent Mahler Sixth from Chailly/GHL in excellent sonics which are about the best I've ever heard on Blu-ray. This new rendition of the symphony is vastly different from Chailly's first go at the work with RCO, faster, gutsier, meatier, but also more refined and beautifully nuanced.

The Gewandhaus is technically a formidable band with virtually no weak spots to complain about. Its sonic timbres are well balanced from bottom to top, left to right, lean, and beguilingly effective in delivering the sheer scale and power of this masterpiece. This orchestra is what Berlin Philharmonie might have become but failed under the auspices of Simon Rattle.

Two thumbs up, way UP!",1425859200,2,683,5.1441441441441444
8613944,4,B00FAY7F2W,"Next to Bernstein this reading is less manic, steadier of gait, and decidedly less emotional. If I prefer both Bernstein and Abbado, it's because I miss the emotion, and the borderline insanity I believe Mahler built into his music. The Leipzig Orchestra plays very well, and the sound and picture quite good. While the camera work is not always where I would like it to be, it is certainly never less than decent.",1401062400,3,414,4.684931506849315
8613945,5,B00FAY7F2W,"This disc was recorded over three performances in 2012. The final result is a seamless 'performance' as if recorded in one single 'take.' The order of movements places the scherzo third and the slow movement second which relates to the second and final printed edition of the score.

Chailly takes a markedly forward-paced view of the work and this is established from the start with a driving and biting attack from the lower strings. The effect of this insistent approach is to produce a dramatic rather than a tragic effect. This is in marked contrast with Abbado's performance from Lucerne where Abbado lays great emphasis on the emotional content of the work which delivers an almost spiritual experience, Chailly, in contrast, aims primarily for structural clarity which in turn delivers a work of dramatic drive and intensity. He justifies this by emphasising Mahler's own preference that the music should be able to speak for itself by way of its compositional structures.

Thus Chailly, in his post performance discussion, makes the point that Mahler valued clarity above all in his music making and that is what Chailly absolutely delivers here. The 'fateful' hammer blows in the finale are therefore dramatic rather than tragic in their effect. Overall this is large-scale music making of real muscularity supported with superb individual and corporate playing. The reading is bitingly dramatic for much of the time, with the slow movement offering respite from the on-going drama of the rest. It would be misleading to describe the performance as refreshing as that would possibly imply something lightweight. However it does deliver a refreshing concept by its emphasis on clarity and drama rather than tragedy as the ultimate goal.

The sound is particularly vivid with wide range and depth and is fully up to the considerable demands of this score with its huge orchestral forces requiring an enormous range of timbres. The camera work is typical of this producer and offers an ideal combination of non-invasive detail as well as more distant shots. The imaging itself is crystal clear and of high quality resolution and colour reproduction. The sound is provided in DTS 5.1 and stereo of great clarity and range and of considerable realism.

The bonus feature of this disc amounts to an 18 minute discussion in front of an audience with two colleagues. During this, matters such as the order of movements, the reduction of hammer blows down from the original 5 to the current 2 are discussed in some detail. Also discussed are interpretive details of the actual performance and various influences upon the presentation of the work historically and currently. It might be a good idea to watch this bonus feature before the performance although I personally watched the performance first.

This, therefore, is a very impressive concept, performance and recording which is certainly the equal of the fine Abbado alternative. I would hesitate to describe either of these disc as the better as they really offer two alternative but complementary views, both done very well and convincingly.

In summary, I would suggest that committed collectors would probably benefit by opting for both discs while others, not so committed to collecting multiple versions, would probably be content with either and should consider themselves lucky to have such a choice at this level. This is an excellent disc on all counts and will arguably be the preferred choice for those who resist Abbado's more emotional reading.

8613946,5,B00FAY7F2W,"Riccardo Chailly continues to convert formerly dour Leipzig into a modern day 'Mahlerville'. In the accompanying 'panel discussion' on the sixth symphony, Chailly states people on the street ask him when the next Mahler performance will be happening. Another commentator points out that there have been two back-to-back Mahler festivals in Leipzig. Wow! - as I've said before, this is a great time to be a Mahler enthusiast. Anyway, this is a really fine performance of Mahler six that, in my opinion, is even better than the already fine dvd issue of M6 that Claudio Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra put out just a few years ago. That said, no one would go wrong by either one. Let's talk about the differences between this one and Chailly's '80s audio recording for Decca with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

In the accompanying panel discussion, Chailly states that he based his earlier Concertgebouw recording on Wilhelm Mengelberg's marked-up score (complete with metronome markings, which Mahler almost never used). As a result of that, the first movement is three minutes faster here than in Amsterdam! (22:30 vs. 25:30). I like the deep pitched cowbells better from the Concertgebouw percussion section, but they're perfectly adequate in Leipzig as well. There's definitely a more 'manic' energy to this Leipzig first movement. This is followed up with the Andante Moderato movement, whereas Chailly recorded M6 in scherzo/andante order in Amsterdam. So far, I'd call it a tie.

It's interesting to note that the timings for the slow movement are identical for both performances, even though the order has now been switched. I think the movement sounds a tad more spontaneous and 'heartfelt' here than in Amsterdam, but that may simply be a matter of 'live' vs. studio recording. Both are good (with great cowbells in Amsterdam - again). Slight edge to Leipzig, but not by much.

The scherzo is where we find Chailly's most radical 'rethink'. In the Decca recording, Chailly pretty much took the scherzo at the same tempo as the end of the first movement (which he already took a tad slower than usual). As a result, there was a sort of 'cubistic' feel to his earlier scherzo that may have better suited Adorno's description of the scherzo as being a, quote, ""Laendler dance with a Polar Bear"". Chailly now takes the scherzo at a very fast clip, with strong contrasts between fast and slow sections (the numerous variants of the trio section). As a result, this scherzo now times in at less than 12 minutes (vs. 13:20). I agree with Chailly's comment (from the panel discussion) that if you're going to place the scherzo third, then you have to do it at a tempo that's very different from the first movement. I'm not sure, however, why that same comment can't apply when performing M6 in scherzo/andante order. Advantage: Leipzig. I like this scherzo much more. Now the finale.

The booklet timing of 34:20 for the finale is deceptive, as there are several minutes of applause and soloist acknowledgments at the end of the same track. And that particular fact brings me to my one and only complaint: I think any dvd of Mahler 6 would be far more effective with a visual fade-out shortly after the symphony's audio fade-out. Let the screen go completely black for 20 seconds or so. Better yet (and more dramatic as well), turn the screen completely black at the symphony's final A-minor outburst - before the audio fade-out, in other words.

I really don't understand why musicians and recording companies feel so insecure, that they think it's necessary to show several minutes of ovation and self congratulations. Let Mahler have his say and then get out. Enough of that.

I would have to re-listen to the Decca finale to comment on any minor differences between the two. This Leipzig finale seems very similar to me. In both instances, Chailly uses a large wooden sound box and wooden hammer for the two hammer strokes (this is becoming the norm everywhere). And in both instances, Chailly elects not to employ the optional cymbals and tam-tam (large gong) to reinforce the second hammer stroke. In both instances, Chailly takes the final A-minor outburst at the very end of the symphony at a slower than usual tempo (I like it!). Chailly is good in both finales.

Given the additional, interesting panel discussion (available with English subtitles), I would recommend this Chailly dvd over the Abbado. But as I stated earlier, both are good. I like it that the panel discussion sticks to musical issues pertaining to the sixth symphony, and doesn't bother to rehash the same-old, tired biographical and autobiographical comments. Excellent picture and sound quality. Fully recommendable in every respect.",1386806400,18,4723,4.9860406091370555
8613947,5,B00FAY7F2W,This is a magnificent performance and outshines the very good Abbado recording from 2006. The camera work is outstanding and the sound rich and beautifully focused. I wish Chailly would do 5 and 7.,1385078400,12,197,4.823529411764706
