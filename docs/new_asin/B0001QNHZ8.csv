8016207,5,B0001QNHZ8,"I saw this when it first came out as a Project 20 documentary on TV. Alexander Scourby does a first rate narration and the very last sentence stuck in my head ever after. As the camera pans the ruins of Berlin Scourby intones in regard to Hitler's death: ""If you seek his monument, look around.""",1468022400,,295,4.381818181818182
8016208,5,B0001QNHZ8,"An excellent documentary compiled from Allied and German sources describes well the rise and fall of Adolph Hitler and the National Socialist German Worker's Party.  The musical background to this filmography is stunning and carries great drama. Project 20 made great television drama with more than a little accuracy.  The last words describe Hitler, ""if you seek his monument, look around.""",1434326400,,392,5.409836065573771
8016209,5,B0001QNHZ8,"Who better to narrate a clash of idealogies than Alexander Scourby. Another splendid work, brilliantly compiled for the
Project 20 series.",1361836800,2,138,5.619047619047619
8016210,4,B0001QNHZ8,I have used this video in school for years to teach the basics of the time period.  It flows smoothly and the music is fantastic.  The re-enactment sequences are easy to identify.  It always promotes discussion.,1336176000,2,211,4.805555555555555
8016211,5,B0001QNHZ8,The Twisted Cross is an excellent portrayal of the rise and fall of Hitler's Third Reich.  I used it in high school history classes for many years as did several other history teachers.  It should be required viewing in schools today.  It should provoke questions and more student research into the dark days of Germany.,1289174400,3,320,4.781818181818182
8016212,3,B0001QNHZ8,"""The Twisted Cross"" is an excellent documentary on the life and reign of Adlof Hitler.  The vocabulary used is definitely high school level.  However, the sound creates a real problem for classroom use.  Whenever there is music used it is twice the volume of the spoken word.  It was loud enough that the classes next to mine could hear the music thru the walls.  Constantly adjusting the volume is a problem.",1237161600,,409,4.704225352112676
8016213,2,B0001QNHZ8,"I have watched this film on several occasions and first saw it in high school back in the seventies.  Even then I was shocked at how many staged and fictional scenes were interspersed with genuine film footage.

In one instance we see actually see 'Hitler' running away and jumping into his car after the failure of the 1923 'Putsch'.  We are also privileged to see 'actual' footage of people being executed during the 'Roehm Purge' of 1934.  There is footage of 'Stauffenberg' and his 'conspirators' planning their assassination attempt of July 20, 1944, of Jews being 'executed' en masse, of 'Hitler' sitting in the dark, in the depths of his Berlin bunker, contemplating the end of the Third Reich in 1945.  It is interesting to note that nowhere does the film provide a disclaimer nor any other kind of acknowledgement that many of the scenes shown are, in fact, 'recreated'.

All of this proves that the producers could not or would not produce a factual, accurate film about Hitler's rise to power.  Instead, to support their obvious bias, they make liberal use of fictional and staged footage in a sloppy attempt to 'document' their prejudiced point of view.  In addition, a rather harrowing Wagnerian musical score dramatizes melodramatically the 'evil' they plainly have great difficulty sifting from the historical record.

The 'Twisted Cross' is nothing but a piece of Allied propaganda and is a very poor substitute for an actual portrayal of the Nazi years.",1161475200,3,1470,4.96734693877551
