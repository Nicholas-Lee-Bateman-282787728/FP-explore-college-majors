8378238,5,B000068MAN,"This is the last episode of Mini Goddess series. As others, this one is named by one of the goddesses (Sculd), but also like others, not exclusively for Sc8ld's story. This episodes have a great plus factor, if you are familiar with some Japanese anime such as Captain Harok or GalaxyTrain 999. Because some episodes used that motive quite a lot, and if you can appreciate the similarity of looks and tones of the vision and the music, it's just so exciting. Beldandy in Metel's black suit, can you imagine that? That's just me giving me a blast! Again, the vision is gloriously cute and ultra hyper super duper charming. It may sound strange, but after watching this fantstically pretty anime, I kind of feel sad, because they are so unrealistically charming and cute. Any way, great great anime. Lovely lovely pictures. Pinky winky songs. And, funny funny stories.",1147219200,,866,4.818791946308725
