8112153,5,B000EOTELS,"I didn't get one of two of this 2 Disc DVD Six part PBS Nature Program on this site in time for my animal loving son since it's currently unavailable right now. But we found the two remaining good and excellent conditions on Ebay. With a little help from his two Uncles my Brothers. The two remaining 2 Disc DVD Six part PBS Nature Program Triumph Of Life are playing very well & my son is enjoying the episodes just as he used to see on TV in 2001. Especially seeing some of his favorite Animals like some Mammals, Birds, Reptiles and of course some Dinosaurs that featured in the six episodes of this six part PBS Nature Program.",1516060800,,631,4.310924369747899
