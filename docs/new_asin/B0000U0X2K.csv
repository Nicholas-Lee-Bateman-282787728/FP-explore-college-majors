1946255,4,B0000U0X2K,"Now that Bill Maher has been booted off network TV and onto HBO, he is finally free to really speak his mind.  His most recent HBO stand up special is scaldingly funny, riffing on the failures of Bush Administration in Iraq in particular.  Maher is a Libertarian, not a Liberal (yes, there is a HUGE difference), but his disgust at the course American has taken the last three years is obvious.  Particularly poigniant is Maher's overall theme, that during the war in Iraq, the government has made no effort to get civilians on the home front to sacrifice in any meaningful way.
The only knock on the CD is that the show is only an hour, and there are no extras included on the disc.",1080259200,8,683,4.448
1946256,4,B0000U0X2K,"Besides watching this DVD, I also went to this show (there were about 20 of them with slight variations) and I must say that he is very provacotive, thought provoking and humorous. Perhaps there were a few segments where he went over the board with cursing, but nonetheless it was almost necessary to insert into the show to depict a point.
It's obvious that he has a liberal agenda, like myself, but unlike most left and right wingers who fall into those categories by a mere conviction from media and the like, Bill explores the topics with careful analysis and satisfactorily provides reasons for being a liberal. He also clears up the myth that ""liberal"" is a negative term, which is true if one is to look it up.
I gave it 4 stars, not because he wasn't good - in fact he was brilliant - but because I felt he should have included more topics and more humor into the show. However, I like his insensitivity to religion and catholic church as well as his promotion of racial profiling in the times of war if we are to win it. He also explores the war in Iraq, oil, SUV's and sale of diamonds.
All in all, good work and a clear voice of reason!",1078876800,13,1147,4.339534883720931

If I can be proven under-informed, if even wrong.in my worldly views, and then made to laugh either way, then I'd say this comic did much more than made me laugh.  My favorite teachers did just the same thing; I was totally engaged and perfectly accepting that my preconceptions could be proven wrong.

1946334,4,B0000U0X2K,"Bill is a very funny guy, and I love him. So I enjoyed this show enormously. It's an hour-long stand-up show in a New York theater, and the bonus materials include another 20 minutes or so of him fielding questions from the audience, mostly with a serious bent. As most of you know, much of Bill's humor is political, and so in 2003 it was about Iraq, George Bush, and related overtly political issues. There are also discussions of feminism, relations between men and women (""Explore our mutual fantasies? Folks, there's no such thing."") He's one of the few Americans who gets away with pointing out that men and women really are different, and it's no good pretending this is not so. But he does it with what I consider to be real respect for women, although during the Q&A session, one woman called him out on it, and he managed to confuse her sufficiently to have her retire laughing.

He also pokes fun at religion, as you all know from having heard about Religulous, a movie he has done more recently. Further, he makes the very valid point that we cannot win the war on terror while still fighting the war on drugs. He downplays the extent to which the terrorists finance their operations with drugs, possibly because the extent of the connection was not known at that time. His big target for financing is oil, and I'm sure he's right, but there are indeed huge opium poppy fields in Afghanistan at least.

If I enjoyed it so, why did I give it only four stars instead of five? Because it has been 6 years and some of the material is pretty dated. And some of it, sadly, is a little tasteless. Not bad, but not as good as to merit five stars. Don't worry, Bill, I still love you, and I know that like fine wine and Sean Connery, you have improved with age.",1336867200,,1764,4.4079754601226995

This man has a beautiful mind, so enjoy the laughter while thinking: are married people happy? Do we really support our troops? Do we really respect our politicians? Do you really understand the real reasons behind the wars we are involved in???

This DVD is for people looking for some comedic relief, in perilous times of scandal and corruption. It is a partisan tour de force, for sure, but Maher knows that he is a rational viewers last best hope, and he doesn't disappoint. He is fearless in this special.
I will recommend this to moderates, as well. It is just hilarious. There is one great rip on the Vatican that you will never forget.

1946342,4,B0000U0X2K,"It is almost ashame that North Amercian culture needs Bill Maher.

After all, shouldn't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind.

Maher's central premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement. Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match.

Maher does this by not pretending he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion.

On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor conservative, right-wing or left-wing.

The end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media, political columnists and special interest groups, know wonder we need him so much.",1110326400,11,1282,4.889400921658986
1946343,3,B0000U0X2K,"This DVD was on one of my recommendations so I rented it. This was the first time I heard of Bill Maher. First the good stuff:

- Talks about Bush and about Democrats

- The way words are used in debate and Americans with their short attention span decide like a hamster

- Right on about the drug war. He makes great points about how we are ruining the farm land in Columbia. And how those drugs aren't as bad as some stuff we see on TV.

- Makes good points about the absurd tax cuts for the rich

- I liked the question and answer session which is part of the extras

- There were some funny parts

I read that Bill Maher was on a show called Politically Incorrect. Basically, if you are a Catholic, Muslim, female, and other things, you may be offended. Some of the stuff he said about females offended me. But plenty of women in the audience were cheering... which made me sad.... Anyway, even if I disagree with some of what he says, I would always fight for his right to say it.  Freedom of speech is one of the things that makes this country great.

The audience was crazy about Bill Maher. That's why I wish he had used the opportunity to tell these people really important stuff.

Maher comes to the conclusion that we can end terrorism in the following ways:

1. Stop the drug war

2. Eat less (be less gluttonous)

3. Do racial profiling at airports

While the first two suggestions are very good, none of the above three things will end terrorism. Only a massive overhaul of our foreign policy will do that. (since the 1950s, we've been pursuing imperialistic interests in the Middle East to control their oil, and we've overthrown their democratically elected leaders many times)

Then Maher states the following:

- Muslims hate us for our freedoms

- We are better than them

- America foreign policy has nothing wrong with it

- He states Muslims stay quiet when someone tries to make the country democratic (gives Salman Rushdie example)

- All Muslim countries are the same (he gives some accurate lifestyle stories of Saudi Arabia - but countries which have Muslims in them like Morocco, India, Syria, etc. are vastly different than Saudi Arabia - but someone would walk away from Maher's speech thinking they are all like Saudi Arabia)

All of the above are things that Republicans have stated. Our government and our corporate owned media state the above things all the time. Aren't liberals suppose to tell us the story that Republicans don't mention?  Maher says that Muslim people don't stand up when injustice is done. But when 1.5 million Iraqis - 500,000 of them were children, died from 1991 - 2003 because of U.S. imposed sanctions, why didn't most Americans do anything? Maher doesn't mention that. (Madeline Albright, Secretary of State under Clinton, said the deaths from the sanctions were worth it)

I think Maher is right on for some things, but he totally misses the mark for others. If you want to know the real reason we invaded Iraq, you only have to read: Confessions of an Economic Hitman By John Perkins. Everything will make sense to you if you read it.  Also if you want intelligent progressivism, I would recommend renting ""The Awful Truth"" series by Michael Moore.

Or for well thought out, intelligent, and rational arguments which make me proud to be a liberal, any books by Noam Chomsky, Molly Ivins, Howard Zinn or Jim Wallis are good.",1110153600,13,3386,4.6033333333333335

Bill wears many hats, political analyst, a formidable debater, social conscious for the political arena, religion and the world situation.

2.)  That this guy is friends with Michael Moore, and together the two of them are poisoning the minds of millions with their hatred and contempt for Americans.",1097971200,5,388,4.550724637681159

1946349,5,B0000U0X2K,"This is typical Bill. He never changes. In all the years I've followed him he's been consistent with his stance on Republicans, Democrats, drugs, marriage, religion, etc. He does seem to be preaching at times but he's always witty and hilarious. I don't agree with everything he says but he's honest and I respect that.",1088812800,14,319,4.818181818181818
1946350,5,B0000U0X2K,"The controversial Maher is a voice of reason in a nation obsessed with terrorists, religious dogma, political partisanship, and male-female roles.  The comedian tackles these and other hot topics in the way that only the former host of ""Politically Incorrect"" could.
I don't think a certain Mr. Bush would find much to laugh about in Maher's routines, but the rest of us should find some food for thought, especially in light of the current anti-American climate in much of the world.",1084060800,41,484,4.9753086419753085
1946351,5,B0000U0X2K,"I've loved Bill's analysis of things in his two shows (Politically Incorrect and Real Time), and I knew I was in for a treat with this new DVD.  I was more than satisfied.
The topics he discusses are varied, and he dissects them with a common-sense style that is hard to argue against it.  Better yet, he does in a way that has you laughing all the way.  Definitely one of the best comedic social criticism I own, alongside other greats like George Carlin.  Buy this.  No matter what your political persuasion, you won't be disappointed.
Bill, just want you to know that, I was with you when they took your show unfairly for saying the truth about the terrorists' ""cowardice"".  Don't let the establishment silence you.  Keep the good work coming!",1082764800,10,746,4.606060606060606

For those that don't like to hear the truth about priests,  the church, lies that you are suppose to believe because of the source, well all of these people would not find it funny because they live in denial. Bill speaks the truth about recent events and things that are brushed under the rug. Buy it, watch it, and repeat. This is well worth your time, over and over again.",1081555200,8,401,4.346666666666667
1946353,5,B0000U0X2K,"OK, the title is a little suck-up sounding and was more or less meant as a play on words but in some ways not. As far as political commentators/entertainers go, most just don't get it. The majority of celebrity ilk who think that they have some politcal axe to grind fail miserably at everything except constant sloganeering. It's almost as if they see it in a magazine or on a sign at a protest and they simply repeat it everywhere that they go. Then, there are a small group that pay attention to what is going on, ask questions, demand answers and make suggestions. This is what sets Bill Maher apart from the armchair activists in the entertainment business. While you have Michael Moore on one side and Rush Limbaugh on the other screaming at each other that they are always right, Bill Maher steps far away from the namecalling and posturing and more or less strives to engage in a discussion on not who's necessarily right but how do we fix what has been broken.
Through humor and keen insight, Bill Maher breaks down his views on the day's most pressing issues and offers up ideas on how to really fight terrorism through everything from separating religion from state to boycotting diamond purchases. Initially; and especially if you take the conservative word for it, one might gather that Bill Maher is a ""liberal"". In truth, he is a liberal but not even close to the way that most of Holloywood leans. Bill Maher cuts through the fat and gets to the heart of the matter and in the end, his opinions really lean neither right or left but Bill Maher has more or less created a niche all his own which seemingly leaves him open to a barrage of criticism but as one quickly discovers, he's all too ready to defend himself with a large success rate.
My favorite part of the DVD is the Q & A Session where he takes a series of questions from his audience. It is so very rare when someone with a certain modicum of fame gives his fans the floor to voice their opinions and concerns and Bill Maher approaches this segment in a very even-handed and rationale manner and for that, I tip my hat to him. He proves himself gracious and humble and that earns a monster amount of respect.
Despite what trappings conservatives have set for him, Bill Maher does a splendid job of dodging them all and proving that liberal doesn't have to equal the steroetypes that; unfortunately, many famous liberals espouse in droves. Bill Maher is a stand alone person who deserves to be heard by anyopne who thinks.",1081296000,10,2498,4.528761061946903

8003005,5,B0000U0X2K,"I admit that I do not agree with everything that Bill Maher says, but even when I disagree, he makes me think. He is an intelligent fellow and his remarks are incisive and causes people like me to think. This show was from a live airing at the Hudson Theatre in New York City. It was a 2003 HBO show. He was emphasizing, so he said, that victory is achieved at home.
He spoke among much else about the war in Iraq. He emphasized that we are misled by the US propaganda about the war, about the Clinton-Lewinsky Affair, about the assurance that we have an alliance, and much more. He mocked Dick Chaney and said he came from a city that was more white than a ghost. He said that Muslim men keep their women in bee-keeper suits and can get away with it by mentioning the secret word religion. Focusing on the US, he said, we prefer to undress our women rather than place them in bee-keeper suits and asked what can a whore wear that other women are not already wearing.",1514678400,,967,4.260869565217392
