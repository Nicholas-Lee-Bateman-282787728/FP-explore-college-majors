8174783,1,B000N4SHUS,Only a 15 minute excerpt.  The original is much longer. It is one of my favorites. I have it on VHS and was hoping to add it to my DVD collection.,1392681600,,146,3.7096774193548385
8174784,5,B000N4SHUS,"If you like the smell of the ocean, the feel of salt water between your toes, and think knot tying is a lost art, this movie is for you.  Beautifully made and with truly magnificent narration, this film is a piece of sea history.  If none of the above apply to you, then don't bother.  For true lovers of the sea, this movie brings you to places where sailing isn't a weekend adventure but a way of life.  This may be the last chance to peer into the past and see what it is really like to live and die by the sea.",1104969600,7,514,3.9611650485436893
8174785,5,B000N4SHUS,"This movie is a piece of living history that is rapidly vanishing.  For anyone interested in maritime history this movie takes you back to the days of sailors that worked with the wind.  A little bit of everything is thrown in; sailors lives, types of boats and sails, and boat construction techniques from a wide variety of cultures.  The cinematography is stunning.
This is not a movie for refrigerator boat sailors.  These are not finely kept yachts with exquisite brightwork, they are working boats that real sailors make their living from.  If you want to get the last chance to see traditional wind craft at work this is a great movie.",980380800,6,641,4.738738738738738
