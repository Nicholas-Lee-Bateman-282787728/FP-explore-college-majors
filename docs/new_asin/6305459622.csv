7890674,4,6305459622,Every person over 60 years old will love to see and hear these classics.  I have the entire program memorized.,1383091200,,110,4.5
7890675,3,6305459622,"I think Sinatra's voice was excellent during the decade of the 60's.  It could be powerful, and it could be soft (as in the Jobim recordings).  So it stands to reason that his voice is excellent in this 1960's television special.

I particularly like his rendition of ""Cycles"" on this DVD.  With his beautiful voice, and the equally beautiful orchestra behind him, he conveys a mood that another singer would have a hard time duplicating.  I've heard it said that Sinatra sang a song for every mood.  The performance of this song confirms that to me.  His renditions of ""Nice 'N' Easy,"" and ""How Little We Know"" are equally beautiful.

I enjoyed The Fifth Dimension and Diahann Carroll.  Is this my favorite Sinatra DVD?  No.  That honor goes to the Sinatra DVD which has Ella Fitzgerald and Antonio Carlos Jobim on it.  That show was the best!  However, this one is worth watching.",1346025600,,882,4.686274509803922
7890676,3,6305459622,"I own almost all things Sinatra. All I can say is this is a video full of gaps. I enjoy a couple of the songs on here and the medley - which I think is great.

However, this is Frank trying to maintain his classic style. While at the same time attempting to stay modern. The hippie movement must have been big at this time. Glad I didn't have to live through this time period....yuck!",1138233600,,384,4.12
7890677,1,6305459622,"I see that a deluxe five DVD set of Barbra Streisand's TV specials has been released recently... So why doesn't Warner/Reprise do the same thing for Frank Sinatra's classic TV specials? Could ""The Family"" be involved perhaps...? Sure, they can get behind a phony ""Sinatra at the Palladium"" multi-media extravaganza where you watch 20-foot projected videos of Sinatra singing accompanied by a live orchestra thanks to ""unprecedented access to Frank Sinatra's film archives""... but they can't seem to get Sinatra's video performance legacy released appropriately on DVD...

The classic 1960s, 70s, and 80s musical TV specials (A Man and His Music Part I & II, Sinatra+Ella+Jobim, The Main Event, etc...) are still being sold as individual DVDs at full price ($15-$20 each). They are each about 50 minutes long with ""stereo"" sound (actually ""2-channel mono"" I think) with no bonus features whatsoever, packaged in flimsy plastic and cardboard cases.

Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.

Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part). Wouldn't a DVD set like this be a better 90th birthday ""limited edition"" release than reissuing the sub-standard Duets CDs again? And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!

I am truly very happy for all you Babs fans though! You're ""the luckiest people in the world...""",1133827200,3,1754,5.165492957746479
7890678,4,6305459622,"This special remains one of Sinatra's weaker ones only because he gets too silly at times trying to be contemporary (e.g. wearing love beads).  However, it is a fun show and in some way reflects the uproar and uncertainty of 1968.....
Sinatra also includes classics from the past - the NICE'N EASY & HOW LITTLE WE KNOW medley is great and uses the original Riddle charts.  You can see Frank being backed up by about 40 musicians - a lot of fun.
But the highlight has to be the saloon song medley especially HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY with a DON COSTA chart which is much more modern than the one by Gordon Jenkins but equally as moving and a bit more reflective perhaps.  I remember watching this saloon medley about 2 days after Frank had died......it was touching.
So to me the classic tunes mentioned are worth the whole special!",1042416000,4,827,4.5
7890679,5,6305459622,"I brought this mainly to hear Diahann Carroll sing the Barbra Streisand standard ""The Music That Makes Me Dance."" It's a great reindition that stands up to the original perfectly.",1005264000,2,179,5.0
7890680,4,6305459622,"I was at the taping of this show at NBC Burbank, CA. Studio 4.  Mr. Sinatra came into the studio to do the dress rehearsal.  I remember how touching his rendition of ""Cycles"" was.  After the dress, he left  the studio and did not do the actual show for an invited black-tie  Budweiser audience.  We later found out that he had just broken up with Mia  Farrow.  Cycles had so much more meaning after I found out.",949449600,5,411,4.246753246753247
