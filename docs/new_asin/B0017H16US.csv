8326158,5,B0017H16US,"""I am Special Police Negotiator Reiko Usagi, Let's begin our negotiation,"" is what Ryoko Yonekura says at the end of the movie trailer.  This is one of the best police dramas I have seen in a long time.
Usagi Reiko is the first woman negotiator for the MPD in Tokyo Japan.  She walks right into a hostile enviroment with her coworkers who don't seem to want her there.  Her Cheif Kirisawa Keigo, played by; Jinnai Takanori would rather see her fail and crawl home to lick her wounds than to give her any bit of encouragement.  But, through perseverance she proves herself as not only a good negotiator but, the best that Division 1 has ever seen.  This is worth seeing again and again, I wasn't able to get enough and can't wait for the movie. ;)
