3969403,5,B002R0ELCY,"I loved this movie. Truly loved it.

Is this movie a faithful adaptation of a previous DC story? Nope. Is it a composite of several great DC stories? Yes, and I think it improves upon the source material by eliminating many extraneous elements and even expanding motive for Good Lex and Owlman.

Myself being a long term martial artist, I also have to say that Wonder Woman really knows her Greco-Roman wrestling... rather fitting, don't you think? The fight choreography in this animation is stellar, and especially imaginative when incorporating superpowers with martial tactics.

Finally, I have to applaud the inclusion of many obscure DC characters that are represented in this movie as Crime Syndicate ""Made Men."" My favorite example... SORTA SPOILER ALERT... is the evil version of the Marvel Family, normally Captain Marvel (Shazam,) Captain Marvel Junior, and Uncle Marvel... among several others. In this animation, Superwoman is accompanied by the ""Super Family,"" of Captain Super, Captain Super Junior, and Uncle Super. Captain Super even has the characteristically squinted eyes of Billy Batson, and Uncle Super's grunting is voiced by none other than Bruce Timm. Hilarious.

I have nothing negative to say about this movie and would recommend it to any true fan of the DC characters, many of whom receive their first animated treatment in this movie!",1266537600,4,1364,5.2146118721461185
3969404,3,B002R0ELCY,"REVISED REVIEW --

I have noticed that there have been many reviewers who've said that they don't have a point of reference for this film. First, I will provide the background, then I will give my review of the film.

BACKGROUND --

This film is loosely based on the 1999 graphic novel ""JLA: Earth-2"" by Grant Morrison, Mark Waid in the 2003 and the 1980s ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" mini-series by Marv Wolfman. Both feature a group of supervillians from an alternate universe intermittently referred to as the Crime Syndicate who are the polar opposite of the Justice League.

The core of the group features the following characters:

1. Ultraman -- Superman's counterpart; he was an ambitious astronaut who had a space shuttle accident.  Aliens discovered and saved him from his near fatal wounds. Their medical assistance, while sparing his life and giving him superhuman powers caused him such post-operative stress that it destroyed his mind. When he returned to his Earth, he started his reign of terror. His deadly sin is Anger.

2. Owlman -- Batman's counterpart -- both Batman's and Owlman's relatives were brutally murdered when they were very young. While Batman made the decision to hunt down and capture criminals, Owlman learned a different lesson from this traumatic event. He identified with his murderous oppressors and became a head of organized crime in Gotham City. His deadly sin is Envy.

3. Power Ring -- Green Lantern's counterpart -- The premise of the Green Lantern is that a brave, worthy soul is chosen by a ring and he uses said ring as an instrument of justice. Conversely, Power Ring's ring, Volsthom, is subtly in control of its host and uses its human vessel for its own ends. The human's deadly sin is Sloth; his ring's deadly sin is Avarice.

4. Superwoman -- Wonder Woman's counterpart; in the Earth-2 graphic novel, she has a secret identity as editor of the Daily Globe. While Wonder Woman is something of a Amazonian diplomat, Superwoman is a viking. In comic books, she also is secretly married to Ultraman despite the fact that she truly despises him. Her deadly sin is Lust.

5. Johnny Quick --- Flash's counterpart; while Earth 1's Flash acquired his powers by a freak accident, Quick possesses his because he is taking radioactive steriods which seem to be slowly killing him. In many ways, he is the most unstable of this group. His deadly sin is Gluttony.

The Syndicate's primary nemesis is none other than Earth-2's intelligent, impossibly vain but nonetheless well-meaning Lex Luthor.

REVIEW OF THE FILM --

I don't believe in spoilers.

With that said, I want to tell the readers that the three most compelling characters in the movie were Superwoman (Wonder Woman's counterpart), Owlman (Batman's ""anti-ego"") and Batman, himself.

Superman, Green Lantern, Flash, Ultraman, Johnny Quick and Power Ring were given very little to do in this film and the Martian Manhunter's role seemed forced. [ The underutilization of these characters was a bit disappointing and the gratuitous Manhunter subplot caused me to rank this a bit lower than I really wanted to.]

However, Superwoman, Owlman and Batman chewed up the scenery!

SUPERWOMAN --- Superwoman (and her surprising crew of henchmen) was given a lot of screen time. Her action sequences were amazing and her twisted interaction with Batman was to die for. If you ever wondered what Wonder Woman would be like if she ever stopped repressing her hot-blooded Amazonian tendencies, this rendering of the breath-taking reckless Superwoman will be a treat.

BATMAN --- For his part, Batman is presented as his most Machiavellian self. He makes moralistically ambiguous decisions in this film that remind the viewer of just how he can be. If DC decides in future films to detail Batman's eventual expulsion from the JLA (a retelling of Mark Waid's ""Tower of Babel"" would be an excellent sequel to this film), the viewer can point to the decisions Batman made here as part of the reason why. While there is very little examination of Batman's actions here, his teammates must have been stunned by his ruthlessness.

OWLMAN ---- And I believe Owlman will become a fan favorite. While each character's reaction to the discovery of parallel universes is unique, Owlman's is as poignant as they come. In reflection (and Owlman's reaction is certainly open to several interpretations), it appeared to me the revelation of anti-matter universes caused Owlman to have a (very understated) nervous breakdown.

James Woods does a fantastic job showing the nuances of Owlman's character. He is equally a frustrated genius, opportunist, philosopher and (in the most nihilistic of ways) nearly heroic. While many villains we have seen in the DC animated past have been driven by money or a desire to rule the world, we have never seen one who so aggressively rejects the premise the super-criminal as alpha-male archetype.

I give this film a 3.5.",1264982400,50,4930,5.009791921664626
3969405,2,B002R0ELCY,"Mark Harmon as Superman great choice, and may be the only reason I buy this. Tim Daly would be great to have back for this as well but for a fresh change you can't go wrong with Mark Harmon.

Billy Baldwin as Batman just may kill it for me though and be the deal breaker. As far as I'm concerned there can only be one voice actor to do Batman or Bruce Wayne and that's Kevin Conroy. They used him for Batman/Superman Public enemies I don't understand why they could not get him for this as well.

As the saying goes if it ain't broke don't try to fix it. I see where getting some new blood in for the voices could be good and for some of the characters it can be a nice change. But for Batman, Lex Luthor, and Wonder Woman there can only be the originals in my book.

After watching the movie I will say all the Actors except William Baldwin were great. William Baldwin was just not convincing as Batman, and that must be much the reason why he was overlooked on the shortlist for 2 of the Batman movies he mentioned in his interview. The story was fairly solid except for the fact they made Batman really weak in this show. If you hate Batman and want to see him get slapped around like a sissy you will love this show. I now see why even if Kevin Conroy was offered Batman in this show he passed on it.",1262217600,7,1304,4.0859375

the plot

As Wonder Woman, Superman, Martian Manhunter and Flash are helping Batman finish his amazing high tech space station for the Justice League, word comes over the wire that Lex Luthor has turned himself in to the local police station in Metropolis. The team goes back down to earth and question Luthor. He claims that he is from a parallel earth where he is the head of the Justice League and that there are some super beings he battles that hold the Earth's populous inside of a prison of fear and submission. These super villains have also been killing off the heroes of the Justice League where The Jester was the last casualty.

Will the ""Super Friends"" travel to this other earth and face their villainous equals? Of course they will. Yet the problems do not begin and end with attempting to liberate a frightened earth. Owlman (Batman's parallel other) has found that there are many earths, each one either slightly different, very different, or very much the same. This gives Owlman a sense of smallness and insignificance. No matter what heinous crimes he and his crime syndicate buddies commit, it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. He figures that if he is able to destroy the ""prime"" earth, then all versions will cease to exist.

the breakdown

These kinds of stories are among my favorite. I love the parallel universe stories as well as the time travel stories even more. What would the evil twin versions want out of life? What will their names be? Well, Crisis on Two Earths answers these, despite having the feel of being slightly unimaginative. The super villains aim in life is to become rich beyond belief and to rule over all. I'm not sure why the super villains need all this money. What are they going to do with it, take a vacation in the parallel Disney World? Ruling the world seems more plausible.

I found it interesting that on the parallel earth, that despite the unparalleled power the Crime Syndicate possesses, they were still held in check by Lex Luthor and his Justice League, as well as the US government. There were still boundaries that the Syndicate had to adhere to. Plus, Luthor was quite powerful in this alternative earth, where he in nowhere near as strong on this earth. Superman's alter ego was named UltraMan who was voiced by Brian Bloom, a native New Yorker, whose accent came in handy to bring the stereotype mafia type of personality. Who would have thought that Superman's alter ego would be Italian?

I liked that the studios don't skimp on the voice talents as they used to do in the 60s, 70s & 80s (and before), where they'd hire one guy to voice almost everybody. (Mel Blanc or Casey Kasim anybody?). Here they have almost one actor per character. Mark Harmon as Superman, James Woods as Owlman, Billy Baldwin as Batman and Chris Noth as Lex Luthor. Their individual personalities emerge through the ink and paint, and it gives the movie an easier flow.

I appreciated that while Owlman was to be understood as an evil genius, it was clear that he was crazy as well. His obsessions with making a difference stems from his own Darwinistic beliefs which only seemed to fuel his self-insignificance and total dismissal for any life, but especially human life which he also views as the ultimate enemy. Crisis on Two Earths is pretty violent, which may come as a shock to some, but when you read the PG-13 rating, it should really come as no surprise. The flick serves up some pretty good laughs especially coming from The Flash voiced by Josh Keaton. It's a lot of fun; it's over pretty quick anyway at 75 minutes long. I recommend this for fans from about nine years old and over.

And in the next fight they forget about the Kryptonite!

3969581,3,B002R0ELCY,"I know I would enjoy superheroes more if I took the time to read the comic books.  Its just a case of too many books, not enough time.  But when I heard of the idea behind Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, I was definitely intrigued.  So I jumped into the movie without the benefit of the TV show or knowing who all the members of the Justice League are.  Maybe that was part of the problem, but I found it just average.

Its a typical day for the Justice League as they are working on their new base of operations.  That is until Lex Luthor (voiced by Chris Noth) shows up.  He claims to be from a parallel Earth, an Earth that is being overrun by the evil twins of the Justice League.

While Batman (William Baldwin) is hesitant to leave their Earth to go save another one, Superman (Mark Harmon), Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshall), Green Lantern (Nolan North), Flash (Josh Keaton), and J'onn J'onzz (Jonathan Adams) quickly go with Lex.  But fighting a league of villains like their own may prove to be too much.  Can they defeatthemselves?

As I say, the idea is intriguing, but it doesnt really get developed.  Then again, maybe Im asking too much out of a 75 minute movie.  It was produced around the same time as the Justice League TV show, and maybe that would have helped me some since part of my concern with the movie was the characters.  I felt like they were pretty much all flat.  Heck, the one guy Id never heard of before isn't someone I still really know.  And if it weren't for the Green Lantern movie last summer, Id still be lost on who he is.  And we don't really learn anything about the bad guys other than that they're bad.

The story is really just an excuse for a bunch of super hero sized fights.  There are a couple of small twists to the story, but for the most part its straight forward.  Nothing wrong with that, but it could have been more entertaining.

The voice work was fine.  The big names (among those not already listed we've got Gina Torres and James Woods) and the small names worked well together.  Again, there was nothing that made it stand out, although any time emotion was called for, the cast did deliver.

The animation was hand drawn but done for TV.  It tells the story, but it was produced fast with little to no attempts to be more artistic.

Its not that I hated the movie; I was entertained while watching it.  But when it was over, I was left asking if that was it.  I guess I was just expecting something more epic.  They certainly could have gone there from the premise.  But to do that, it would have had to be longer.

So if the premise interests you, youll enjoy Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths.  Just don't expect anything mammoth from it and youll be fine.",1432771200,,2726,4.347222222222222

3969613,5,B002R0ELCY,"The superhero known as Lex Luthor travels from a parallel Earth to ours and summons the help of the Justice League to take on the Crime Syndicate, an evil version of the JLA from his own Earth. Agreeing to help him, the Justice League travels to Luthors Earth and takes on the Crime Syndicate, pitting the likes of Superman against Ultraman, Wonder Woman against Superwoman, the Flash against Johnny Quick, Green Lantern against Power Ring, Martian Manhunter against Jedd Jarkus, Hawkgirl against Angelique, and, soon enough, Batman against Owlman.

In a true case of looking in a mirror darkly, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths is a super heroic and super villained thrill ride that gives you two Justice Leagues for the price of one!

Such a simple premise but such a cool story. Why not have the JLA face themselves from an alternate reality? Who would win? If you're fighting someone every bit as powerful as you are, would someone come out on top? What if they thought like you? Talk about playing with ones shadow.

Theres superpowers galore in this movie as each hero gets to take on their counterpart and show what they are fully capable of. More so, you get to see what our beloved JLA would be like had they taken other paths in life as the similarities and differences between them and the Crime Syndicate are explored.

A bunch of other heroes make an appearance in this flick as well, guys like Aquaman, Black Canary, Red Tornado (a personal favorite), Firestorm (another favorite), and more. Kind of a throwback to Justice League Unlimited in that way.

Dont be fooled, though, as this movie is more than just a superhero/supervillain slugfest. It gets into the deeper issues, the big one being about choice. In the context of the movie, if every choice we make spawns an alternate reality where the alternate choice(s) was also made, do any of the choices we make ultimately matter?

This movie is smart, interesting, and grabs you from the get-go. The action is top notch, the animation is ultra sweet, and if these direct-to-video DC Universe movies have proven anything, its that they know how to make a good Justice League flick. I cant wait until they transfer that same know-how to a live action Justice League movie. Can you imagine how awesome thatll be?

Anyway, back to this one. This is such a good movie and is a must-have on any superhero fans movie shelf. You not only get DC Universes all-stars, but the all-stars of a parallel universe as well. Like I said above, definitely a two-for-one ticket and definitely worth checking out.",1424390400,,2565,4.750561797752809

3969636,4,B002R0ELCY,"This DVD movie, in my opinion, is not quite up to the standards that I have grown to expect in my superhero movies. Yes, it is hard to write a Team movie that successfully looks at each character as an individual.

However, we do get some negative development, character references by opposites. On one Earth, we have our regular heroes, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern and the Martian Manhunter, all teaming up with the Lex Luthor from another Earth. This Lex had been the leader of the Justice League on his own Earth, which is victimized by the opposite of the Justice League, an evil version of each member of our Justice League.

It is fun to watch, but as I said, it's just not as good as ""In Blackest Night"" which is part of ""Justice on Trial.""",1420156800,,772,4.507142857142857

Will the Justice League be able to save the world again?

Crisis on Two Earths features some great animation, an interesting storyline, and our favorite superheroes. James Woods is great in his voice role as Owlman while Mark Harmon just doesnt work well as Superman.

3969754,4,B002R0ELCY,It was very interesting. The level of explicit violence made this an animated feature for teenagers/ adults.

3969771,5,B002R0ELCY,"Armed with a script by the talented Dwayne McDuffie
that was originally intended to be the third season of
Justice League Unlimited, producer Bruce Timm and
company have fashioned an epic homage to the silver
age of DC Comics.  Parallel worlds and alternate
destinies are explored as a noble Lex Luthor enlist
the aid of our Justice League in a battle with an evil
alternate version of themselves.  A decent if not
outstanding cast is assembled (by Andrea Romano)
who are all sidelined by James Woods as a clever,
calculating and totally evil Owlman.  The personal
contest between Batman and his doppleganger
make for an intense and exciting climax.  Aquaman
fans also get their geek fix thanks to the pen of
Dwayne McDuffie.  An excellent production with
lots of good bits longtime comic fans will definitely
appreciate.  On target all the way.",1393200000,,845,4.915492957746479
3969772,4,B002R0ELCY,"When you're dealing with anything that runs for a while and has a fantastical element to it, it's almost inevitable that eventually there will be an ""evil duplicates"" story. This is a very well executed and fun take on a very tried and true premise. In an alternate dimension there is a parallel team of heroes to the Justice League, only they're called the Crime Syndicate and they're on the opposite side of the law. When someone crosses dimensions the confrontation is inevitable.

Long time fans of DC animated material may take a minute or two to get used to some of the voices, and for me Mark Harmon as Superman never really clicked. The highlights in terms of voice work are Chris Noth as a heroic version of Lex Luthor, Gina Torres as the villainous Super Woman and James Woods as the nihilistic Owlman. Woods will especially be surprising for those who are only familiar with his more over the top voice work on ""Family Guy"" or ""Hercules.""

The action scenes are extremely well executed, with a multitude of ""that's so cool!"" moments, especially during the climax. Thankfully the story holds up well enough that the fights are able to be properly spaced apart and the bits in between aren't dull or boring. Given the overall simplicity of the story, this is a case where the 75 minute runtime doesn't hurt the film and it feels just the right length.

While the film holds strong, the special features are disappointing. There's no commentary track, which is usually a highlight for these releases. Even more annoying is the featurette on various ""Crisis"" story lines in the comic books. It's an interesting topic but somewhere along the line the decision was made that it be spoiler free. The writers, editors, etc. who talk about the comics don't even really tell the initial premise, to say nothing about the content of the comics. If you happen to have actually read all of the ""Crisis"" stories then you already know what they're talking about and will be ok (assuming your memory holds up well as the story details.) However for those who haven't read them all you'll be left very underwhelmed as people talk about the importance and impact of stories without letting you anything about what actually happened in them.  The ""Spectre"" short is decent enough but it's really too little too late.

The film is worth owning, but it's not worth shelling out extra for the ""2 Disc Special Edition"" because the second disc isn't worth watching.",1393200000,,2452,4.746478873239437
3969773,4,B002R0ELCY,"Loved the story on this one.  The pace was good, keeping your attention throughout.  It was good to see the Justice League fighting other baddies this time - helping Lex Luthor in an alternate universe.  There is the PG-13 rating to consider, so watch it first before you show it to your kids.

The voices were so familiar - Mark Harmon as Superman, William Baldwin as Batman.",1393200000,,376,4.567164179104478

3969779,4,B002R0ELCY,"Forget the Avengers. The Timm/Dini WB cartoons at their best are the best super-hero adventures outside the comics and this is  the last thing written by the great Dwayne McDuffie. It is a near brilliant twist on the alternate universe idea, or rather several brilliant twists. Ultraman, the dark version of Superman, is nothing more than a gang thug while the dark version of Batman, Owlman, is the ultimate nihilist. In between these interesting characterizations is exciting action. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the extra of the Spectre short is a waste and you should just  probably instead get the single disc.",1392508800,,635,4.925233644859813

OK, all decisions create parallel universes.  This only seems to involve humans, as no other planets *cough*Krypton*cough* have intelligent life *cough*Green Lantern Corps*cough* capable of making decisions and splitting universes *cough*Martian Manhunter*cough*.  Owl and Bat go to Earth Prime.  By the logic of the story, either BM stops OM or he fails.  Universe split.  Even before that, the second OM shows up on Earth Prime and decides to take his first step w/ his right or left foot, you have a split.  Earth Prime is effectively unreachable - you leave it the second you make a decision and just wind up on a parallel Earth that branches off closer to Prime than yours.

That, and they overly ramp up Batman who goes toe to toe w/ enemies who should have a hard time not accidentally killing him, and who doesn't let a thing like broken ribs slow him down in a fight to the death against an evenly matched counterpart.  Batman has his purpose in the JLA; punching a WW counterpart isn't one of them.",1391299200,2,1127,4.651515151515151

3969837,5,B002R0ELCY,"I've been a fan of the Warner Brothers DC animated shows and videos for some time. This is one of the best. Imagine a world where everything is backwards, where every hero on our world has a villainous doppelganger on theirs and vice versa. A world where a Justice League led by Lex Luthor and Jester (Joker) takes on a society of villains ked by Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Power Ring, and Johnny Quick. A world where the Justice League is losing.

Fortunately for Luthor, he manages to create a device that allows him to travel to alternate worlds, where he can seek the help of the alternate Justice League. And he needs that help because the foes he is facing have created an ultimate weapon, one capable of destroying the entire multiverse.

The action sequences are amazing, the voice acting superb, with world class performances by Gina Torres and James Woods, in particular, as Superwoman and Owlman. A side plot of a romance between the Martian Manhunter and the daughter of the President of the alternate world slows things down a bit but it's only a few brief sequences. These truly are foes worthy of the Justice League: powerful, murderous psychopaths that will take everything they've got to handle. Highly recommended.",1390608000,3,1235,4.848341232227488

3969893,4,B002R0ELCY,I like cartoon.  I like the new characters they came up with for the parallel world. The show was long.,1388793600,,103,4.15

3969895,4,B002R0ELCY,"This was a decent adaptation, I assume it's based on the the graphic novel ""JLA:  Earth 2"".  It's probably been around a decade and a 1/2 (I'm honestly thinking somewhere in the last 7-15 yr. range, since I read ""Earth 2""), this story reminded me of it, so I assume it's based on it and a pretty reasonable replication on what I remember after after such a long time.",1388793600,,367,4.304347826086956
3969896,5,B002R0ELCY,my son (7) says he likes it a lot. I was caught by surprise by some of the language. but I need read reviews before I let him watch these things.,1388707200,,145,3.7096774193548385
3969897,4,B002R0ELCY,"What can I say, it is a solid story with all the characters we love. I enjoy the parallel earth personalities and it is a joy seeing the justice league and the crime syndicate go at it. It is not a perfect movie, but it is enjoyable.",1388620800,,233,3.978723404255319
3969898,5,B002R0ELCY,Great movie and story line.  My son and I watch it and both us really enjoyed it. I highlhy recommended.,1388620800,,104,4.2

3969903,5,B002R0ELCY,"I saw it a while back and decided to buy it in support of or hope of they make more Justice League animated movies.  It has an epic story, well developed characters and everything that makes a good animated story.",1388361600,,213,4.325
3969904,4,B002R0ELCY,I have always liked watching a lot of super hero movie. Cartoons are very different from the real world. I like that.,1388361600,,117,4.363636363636363
3969905,5,B002R0ELCY,I love the Justice League.  The art work is outstanding.  The storyline is exceptionally. The cast is remarkable. The heroes are legendary.,1388016000,,139,5.2727272727272725
3969906,4,B002R0ELCY,"One of the best superhero action flicks I've seen. Good storyline ,great dialog,Great action except for the Batman beat down by Owl-Man near the climax. What is it with Hollywood, that the hero has to absorb so much punishment in the fight scenes? Masochists?",1387843200,,259,4.909090909090909

3969908,4,B002R0ELCY,"I enjoyed this movie.  It's a great introduction to the Crime Syndicate and how they all started.  These guys are the bad guys in the current 2013 DC ""Forever Evil"" story line.",1387670400,,176,4.46875
3969919,4,B002R0ELCY,"I liked it. It was interesting to see justice league members from another earth. Not a big fan on how they looked though, I'm so used to the originals.",1387584000,,151,4.241379310344827
3969920,3,B002R0ELCY,The stench of Dwayne McDuffie's mediocrity still hangs about the perimeter of this production. Still an enjoyable and entertaining show it lacks the depth. and vision of DC's best animated offerings.,1387497600,,199,5.451612903225806
3969921,3,B002R0ELCY,"If you like a lot of super-hero battles and a semi-creative plot, then you'll enjoy this movie.  Of course, if you like the Justice League in general, then you don't want to miss this movie.  However, the general plot, once established, does not go very far or become more interesting as the movie plods along with one fight after another.",1387238400,,339,4.633333333333334
3969922,4,B002R0ELCY,Love animated super hero movies. Movies better than live action movies now  better than marvel in that aspect  see if they do live action now,1387152000,,141,4.6
3969923,5,B002R0ELCY,"Love the Justice League. But other than that it finally introduces to you Earth 3 of the DC universe which is an awesome take on the DCU that will definitely make you ponder. A lot of it is just action packed fun and the other half is almost philosophical and makes you delve into the human mind and your mind and make you ask, what if?",1386806400,,336,4.106060606060606
3969924,5,B002R0ELCY,This series narrowed the gap that Marvel had on DC for years. DC attempts to bring some continuity in all of its brands through this series.,1386720000,,140,4.423076923076923
3969925,5,B002R0ELCY,It's an excellent show and great for little kids  and it makes a lot of sense and I love it,1386547200,,91,3.55
3969926,4,B002R0ELCY,"Its light mindless 'feel good' entertainment, and it fulfilled its purpose admirably. I enjoyed watching it, it tugged the nostalgia strings, and brought a smile to my face...which is what I wanted.",1386547200,,198,5.21875
3969927,4,B002R0ELCY,"Good storyline, my favorite heroes!  Reminded me of what impact those Saturday morning cartoons had on me.  Wish they could have shown the heroes in everyday life too.",1386547200,,167,4.928571428571429
3969928,1,B002R0ELCY,This movie is not NOT Good for kids.  There is strong language in it with very dark overtones.  Our children did not like it,1386028800,,124,4.125
3969939,4,B002R0ELCY,A nice twist to the Lex Luthor character.  Moving between parallel worlds to track down the Justice League we know and love in a last ditch effort to rescue his version of Earth.  A great story that will make you think while bringing in some of the well-worn and familiar comic book themes at the same time.,1386028800,,307,4.368421052631579
3969940,5,B002R0ELCY,"If you've played the Injustice game, you'll know where its storyline is based upon.  Alternate Earth's, a dying hope.  The qualms about trust and whose alliance to take up.  I never really complain about the DC Comics movies that come out and this story doesn't disappoint.  Highly recommended.",1385769600,,294,5.0625
3969941,5,B002R0ELCY,"even though I did not purchase Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths from amazon the real hero is  Dwayne Glenn McDuffie whose writing & productions has inspired many in both the DC & Marvel, Omniverse from comic books, video games, TV shows both animated & live action.",1385424000,,269,4.723404255319149
3969942,3,B002R0ELCY,This movie was really interesting at first until it started being about Batman all over again. There was no point in making this exclusively about Batman at the end. He isn't the only superhero in the Justice League.,1384819200,,216,4.7105263157894735

3969944,5,B002R0ELCY,It is an excellent movie. No dull moments. Begins with a bang ends with one as well. Perfect for a D.C. Universe retrospect. Great voice acting. Perfect if you are far behind on anything up to that point. Wish it was 2 hours long. However the 1 hour 16 minutes is a great time filler. Great for parents who want quiet for a while. Just a well rounded cartoon. Worth getting a physical copy. Excellent for fans and non-fans alike.,1384387200,,429,4.375
3969945,3,B002R0ELCY,"The other earths heroes were lousy.
Seems that just putting the justice league on the cover.
Will sell it by itself.",1384300800,,116,4.571428571428571
3969946,4,B002R0ELCY,Excellent movie if your a fan of the Justice League. To bad it didn't have the wander twins and Gleek. Reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid.,1384214400,,160,4.193548387096774
3969947,5,B002R0ELCY,"This movie had incredible action, good voice acting(James Woods as Owlman was the best), and a good storyline. You have to see the last Batman vs. Owlman confrontation/fight!",1384214400,,174,5.25
3969948,5,B002R0ELCY,"It was a very good movie, dealt with complex issues with believable characterizations of the Justice League, with a very satisfying ending.",1384128000,,139,5.363636363636363
3969949,3,B002R0ELCY,Worth watching but not  real great. Recommend for those who like animated super hero movies but not for casual viewers.,1383523200,,119,4.95
3969950,5,B002R0ELCY,Loved seeing more characters in the Crime Syndacate's world than just their Big Five.  Would love to see the counter earth's Jester again.,1383436800,,138,5.0
3969951,5,B002R0ELCY,This is a great storyline from the comics that translates well to the screen.  All of the DC movies (**except live action Green Lantern) have the best production value.,1383091200,,168,4.793103448275862
3969952,3,B002R0ELCY,"That's all. I just don't think any Batman animated should be done without Kevin Conroy, at this point. It's just ... jarring.",1382659200,,125,4.7272727272727275
3969953,4,B002R0ELCY,"I'm a Marvel guy. DC is mostly ""meh"" to me. So I was surprised this was as good as it is. Good voice acting. Good plot. Characters with depth. Best two lines at the end.  :-)",1382572800,,174,3.8333333333333335
3969954,4,B002R0ELCY,It seemed a little gloomy but overall it was an enjoyable movie. It had my 4 year old daughter begging for a chance to watch it again the next day.,1382400000,,147,3.933333333333333
3969955,3,B002R0ELCY,Not sure why the Super Heroes in this movie had to talk PG-14.  Otherwise it would get 5 stars.  These type of movies shouldn't be just for teen or older.,1382140800,,154,4.1

3969957,5,B002R0ELCY,I really enjoyed watching the Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths animated film. It was entertaining and fun to watch. I like all of the Justice League movies that have been made so far and am looking forward to the new one coming out.,1381708800,,236,4.386363636363637

3969969,5,B002R0ELCY,"Seriously, unless you're on of those super duper ones, this movie is the Greatest Story Ever Told! I can say that because this is America and we can say stuff like this here.",1381536000,,174,4.303030303030303
3969970,5,B002R0ELCY,Great story line! Fantastic voice casting! This is a great addition to the DC universe! A must watch for fanboys!,1381104000,,113,4.7
3969971,3,B002R0ELCY,more of a two part series on tv - but worth the time to watch it.  Art work was fair - but the lower quality could be due to issues with line quality forcing a lower display res.,1381017600,,178,3.6842105263157894
3969972,3,B002R0ELCY,"The movie was fun, don't get me wrong. Everyone likes seeing Superman beat the snot out of some villians, and watching Batman out-think the enemy. The only problem that struck me is that there is a pretty major plot hole that they just kinda ignore (although to be honest, I may be more prone to seeing it that most people would based on my personal background).

***spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead***
***spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead***
***spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead******spoilers ahead***

The whole plot revolves around the idea that there is an entire world devoted to every single choice we make. Every time you go left instead of right, there is another world where you go right instead of left. A popular idea and it's certainly a familiar one to anyone who studies philosophy or reads science fiction. The problem with that idea and this movie is that... well exactly the fact that there is ALWAYS a world where the other choice is made. So, there MUST be a world where the same exact thing happens that happened in the movie, except Batman (or really anyone else that contributed to the victory at the end) failed. And that means that Earth Prime would have been destroyed in at least one reality (or if you want to be technical an infinite number of realities). Which means that Earth Prime may not have been destroyed in the story that we saw, but given that the technology to do so is possible, it would have happened in another story we didn't see. And as we are told, once Earth Prime is destroyed, all of reality is destroyed (not going to even touch why that is ridiculous). So it doesn't matter that Batman won. He only needed to lose once, in one version of reality, and we are assured that he must have by the story's own words.

That probably doesn't bug many people, but it bugged the hell out of me. So I gave it 3 stars for being mostly fun, -2 stars for having a plot with more holes in it than there is actual plot. An excellent example of why time travel and multiverse stories are way more complicated to tell than most people think. They took a stab at it here and fell short.",1381017600,,2160,4.664041994750656
3969973,4,B002R0ELCY,"A little dark at times, but an interesting characterization of owl man and one that will stick with me to compare against future attempts. Worth the watch",1380758400,,154,4.7407407407407405
3969974,5,B002R0ELCY,"I have watched this a few times so my review might be biased. This is a good comic movie. I am a comic book fan so when they make a movie I have to see it. It's got a good storyline too, that's a plus.",1380499200,,201,3.488888888888889
3969975,2,B002R0ELCY,It was okay to some degree. Watched it just to see what it was about. Thought it was gonna be a little more combative action between heroes and villains.,1380412800,,153,4.310344827586207
3969976,3,B002R0ELCY,Basicly it's Justice League vs The Watchmen. The origal voices aren't there. if you like comics and JA then you might like this,1380326400,,127,4.565217391304348

3969978,4,B002R0ELCY,Pretty decent story with good animation. The best part of the video for me was the voiceover work done by a range of well known Hollywood actors.,1380153600,,145,4.407407407407407
3969989,5,B002R0ELCY,DC has done it again with another great cartoon movie!!!  Love this story and the disk was great!!!!  Dc slacks on live action but not on their cartoons.,1380153600,,153,4.428571428571429

3969994,5,B002R0ELCY,"Excellent story with the Justice League battling their evil counter-parts, the Crime Syndicate. Batman's evil double - Owlman- is perfectly voiced by James Woods. Art and animation are top notch!",1379808000,,195,5.533333333333333

3969996,3,B002R0ELCY,"The storyline is somewhat predictable, but I was entertained. It's interesting to see how they created the mirrored characters. The science was definitely questionable however. Terms like Heisenberg's uncertainty, quantum element were bandied about with absolutely no relation to their actual meanings. And that thing with the other Flash was exactly the opposite of what should have happened. Moving at close to light speed would cause him to be young while everyone around him aged...

3970027,4,B002R0ELCY,"I read the negative reviews and lowered my expectations with this one, expecting a mediocre to average movie, but it was actually good. It was awesome seeing the bad guys being the good ones in a ""parallel universe"" and as the movie progressed and I found out that the Joker was one of them and then what happened to him afterwards (in the first 4 minutes of the film) I felt sympathetic and sad for him. That scene of the film and a few others were not only unexpectedly original, but they were also more real in that their characters experienced things that they normally wouldn't in the cartoon-world format where characters are rarely affected in the long-term. What happened to Johnny Quick towards the end of the film was another instance of that (which also occurred to a character-Morgaine Le Faye's son-in the episode entitled ""Kid Stuff"" in the Justice League Unlimited series).

As a Batman fan, William Baldwin's voice acting as Batman initially didn't do it for me, but towards the middle to end of the film, I was over it. I don't get why they didn't get the original voice actors from the animated series to do this.

I don't think this film gets enough credit for its insightful and philosophical value in debating whether man is evil or not. It was a central theme of the film that prompted the main antagonist (Owlman) and protagonist (Batman) to quarrel over. And the scenes where he talks about the different worlds and what became of man in a few of them was something that I found interesting. And Owlman as a character, made a good antagonist to argue that pessimistic view of man.

I give the film 4-4 1/2 stars. It exceeded the expectations that I had for it from reading the cynical and unfavorable reviews beforehand and it provided me, the viewer, with some intellectual/philosophical nutrition. The voice acting initially turned me off to the film (I was actually going to stop it five or ten minutes in because of that) and even though the story isn't as bad as some of the negative reviews claim it was (it was actually very interesting) it just wasn't brilliant and I didn't feel as though the film came seamlessly together. Also, the film is only an hour and fifteen minutes. These were a few of the reasons I couldn't give it a five out of five. Still, 4-4 1/2 is still really good. I might even watch it again, to be honest, just so that I can view the social aspects of the story from a different perspective to see in what ways they're relevant to the world we're living in now and have lived in for years.",1377388800,2,2543,4.5359477124183005
3970028,4,B002R0ELCY,"""Crisis On Two Earths"" has a a very interesting story and the it's also an enjoyable DC super-hero movie but it could have been much better. The Bizarro world I guess you could call it is introduced here where the Justice League is known as the Crime Syndicate. They all have counterparts to the League members and are very bad. James Woods stands out amongst the evil heroes as Owlman, Batman's counterpart.
Speaking of Batman, his portrayal in this movie does no represent the Batman I have always envisioned. This is largely because William Baldwin has a higher pitched voice and cannot really project the rage or toughness that Batman requires. For me, I for the most part only enjoyed the parts where Batman was fighting or not speaking. On the otherhand, Superman is a commanding force here; Mark Harmon does an excellent job.
All in all, it's a decent movie but Batman was ruined for me so there is no way I can rate this 5 stars.

I recommend the double-disc version of this because of the special features. Check out the pretty amazing short animated movie of a lesser known DC character named the Spectre, voiced by the wonderful Gary Cole. I was surprised how good this short was.
You also get 2 episodes of the Justice League Animated Series that basically have a very similar storyline to ""Crisis"". ""A Better World"" parts 1 and 2 almost surpass the movie in terms of quality and intensity.

Again, buy this but only if it is the double-disc package.",1377216000,,1462,4.640926640926641

3970070,5,B002R0ELCY,"This is one of the better DC animated movies. Its straight story line and action from beginning to end. The animation and voice overs are excellent. Great job on Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Flash, and their counterparts. Lex Luther from the Syndicate universe was refreshing as a hero who choose never to give up on his world. The Green Arrow as the President of the United States in the Syndicate universe offered a very appealing perspective as to why some people chooses to be passive than fight their oppressors.

I really would have love to seen how the Crime Syndicate came into being. Perhaps a quick origin story would have helped but I don't think they were ever told in the comic books either. Also, the Shazam family are seen several times in the alternate universe as criminal counterparts, why the heroic Shazam family in our universe never showed up to fight them, I will never know.

Owlman is a bit perplexing as a guy who just doesn't seem to care about anything except destroying all reality. I really enjoyed the mafia setting between the Crime Syndicate during their meetings. I never seen that in the comic books either. Great imagination went into this project which could have turned up as dry material if it wasn't in the right hands.

It provides the most flexibility at the least cost.  For those that don't know what an ultraviolet copy is, it is a digital copy of your movie stored on cloud based server (that is, somewhere out on the internet).  You sign up for a free account with Flixster or Ultraviolet (something or other, sorry, forgot the exact name).  Once you have an account you enter your code from the sheet enclosed with the movie and bam all your ultraviolet associated account now have the movie.  Different movies may use different web sites to enter the codes, but once done all accounts have access.

This is a decent show, and I liked the conflict between Batman and Owlman, but most of the rest of the feature is mindless superfight boilerplate that doesn't reach the heights of the fights between Superman and Captain Atom or Supergirl and Powergirl from the first season of JLU.

So my jaundice opinion aside. I think this is a very good story. I didn't read the comic, being an indy comic and marvel fan girl growing up, so I assume it's a close tie to the comic.

What sold this movie on me is James Woods. He has a great voice for villainy and he was the reason I watched Spirits Within and Vampires.

3970221,5,B002R0ELCY,"I'm a big fan of the DCAU (the interlinked animated TV series made between 1992-2006), but most of the DC direct-to-DVD movies I've seen haven't been worth my time much less my money. I'd been interested in this one for some time, but bought it only when the price had dropped.
My interest is because it was written by the late Dwayne McDuffie, it was originally going to be part of the DCAU, it's story taking place between the ""Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited "" TV series, and bridging those shows. McDuffie was an excellant writer (one of the best in the DCAU's Emmy-winning staff), and the story was inspired by one of the best known of DC Comics' Silver Age stories.
In this film, super-hero Lex Luthor - the last surviving member of his Earth's Justice League -  recruits the Justice League to return with him to his world to stop the murderous Crime Syndicate (made up of evil counterparts of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.) Unlike past incarnations, this Crime Syndicate operates like a super-powered Mafia, having divided up the world, and each 'godfather' backed by super-powered lieutenants. They haven't taken over the world because this is more profitable.
Now, I would have snapped this up on it's release had it stuck straight to the DCAU framework, but it was altered to fit into the hodge-podge of DC direct videos, abandoning the familiar DCAU voice cast and  character designs. To my amazement, though, that appears to be all that was changed.
The movie has an ""all-star"" prime-time cast, including NCIS star Mark Harmon as Superman, and James Woods as lead villain Owlman.
Voice acting is different from on-screen acting (on-screen, body language does most of the talking; in voice work, you have only that - your voice - to create character as well as deliver dialogue). So Harmon and Woods came across as subdued, and the best performances were by those with voice acting experience (especially Gina Torres of ""Suits"" as Superwoman, Brian Bloom as Ultraman, and Jonathan Adams as the Martian Manhunter).
Visually, the character designs are in keeping with the DC direct videos, meaning good comic book styling, but only Owlman and Superwoman stand out as memorable.
The final result was a fast paced movie, full of action and good characters, and included a twist (of course), that upped the ante on the final battle.
Had it been made as part of the DCAU, It would easily have been one of the DCAU's best adventures. But the downside is that it's not really DCAU canon, and will probably be lost in the mixed bag which is the DC video releases.
Either way, I'm surprised to say I can recommend this one!",1359590400,,2645,4.798245614035087
3970222,5,B002R0ELCY,"It's easy for superhero movies to get tangled up in their own dizzying realities, be it magic, mutants, robots, aliens, or plain old mad science.  There can never be a single overarching philosophy because superhero comics have all absorbed each other over the decades.  If you keep this big picture in mind it tends to minimize the struggle of weaker superheroes when Superman could show up at any minute and just literally blow the villain away.

One of those challenges is time travel.  Sci-fi authors have railed against this challenge -- that time travel is actually interdimensional travel, and that each time anyone travels backwards through time, they are in fact creating a new reality.  By this logic, it's not possible to change the future of your old past -- you just create new ones.

That suits the superhero just fine though, because it neatly explains why there are so many alternate dimensions.  This can potentially go on for infinity, particularly if there are a lot of time traveling villains messing with the timeline.

""Crisis on Two Earths"" feels like authors fed up with the whole concept.  There has to be only one Earth where everything started.  And if there are infinite realities, then there are infinite opportunities to mess up the other universes.  And if that's true, well we all know Batman (William Baldwin) would be the one to do it.

In this new reality he's Owlman (James Woods), and the only surviving hero fighting back is a ""good"" Lex Luthor (Chris Noth).  It's basically a bizarro version of the DC heroes we know and love, with the gloves off.  Owlman is playing for keeps -- he convinces the other villains he wants to hold the Earth's governments hostage with a bomb, but in reality it's a dimensional bomb that will wipe reality off the map.

There's some great writing and acting here, particularly fleshing out many well-worn characters with their own intricate backstories.  But the acting burden is shouldered most between Batman and Owlman, who demonstrate just what it means to take an ethos to an extreme. In the end, once Owlman realizes that he essentially lives in a comic book universe, he comes to the cold but logical conclusion that he should blow it all up.

Why?  ""Because it's the only thing that matters.""

He's right.  The futility of heroes means fighting in spite of that knowledge.  It's heavy stuff for a cartoon about masked crimefighters in space.",1359072000,,2418,4.8345498783454985

Although this film seemed very rushed it had a fun story and lots of nice battles and a cool story line.

I think Owlman was a bit over the edge in the ""I'm so dark no one understands the world like I do"" department and Wonder Woman was watered down especially considering that her counterpart Superwoman was pretty amazing.

Basically an alternate earth where the Justice League are actually criminals want to invade the normal DC earth and our Justice League has to prevent it by teaming up with the alternate earth's Lex Luthor.

I was happy to see that most some of the voices from the 90's JL was there but the new Lex voice and WW voice were weak.

One thing I did like about this film was that even though Batman/Owlman played
important roles it wasn't a Batman film with the Justice League as window dressing.

Overall I really enjoyed it but was not as good as the JL or UJL of the 90's or even the Superman or Batman series of the 90's. It seems that they have lost the formula that made those so good.

This movie has something truly great to it and that's excellent fight scenes, some of the best I have ever seen and I collect ALL DC and Marvel animated movies and series including the dogs and the ""I wish I could unsee it"" stuff. Even small fights were excellent in this but the major slugfests were epic and incredibly well animated. Owlman has to be one of the coolest bad guys ever! Superwoman was incredible and perfectly voiced by Gina Torres, even coming off as more bad@ss in many ways than Ultra-man. This movie has a lot to offer whether you are a hardcore dc fan or just like superheroes. While Miss Romano has changed up the usual voice cast that we are all used to it was nice to get some different talent in there and with it's incredible fight scenes makes this movie a great addition to the DC animated collection while also letting it stand out if not above other titles.

""Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths""
----------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a life-long comicbook reader, but haven't watched Saturday morning cartoons (or cable) for decades, so the revolution in superhero cartoons has mostly slipped past me. Recently my daughter and I checked out the Batman ""Brave And The Bold"" series, enjoying Season One and all the various team-ups. I picked up this feature-length JLA cartoon once I realized it was a continuation of the Earth One/Earth Two storyline seen in the B&B series (where in a parallel reality all the villains of the normal DC Universe are good guys, and the superhero equivalents are all evil... and guess who has to shut 'em down?)

It was great!  Everything we could have hoped for: a fast, intelligent script, great action, nice touches of humor and a classic super-team super-saga story arc. A couple of unnecessary (but relatively mild) swear words (""hell,"" ""a**"") and a few dark, violent touches, but mostly this is good, old-fashioned, traditional comicbook action -- if you grew up on the '60s/'70s JLA, this animated feature will definitely rock your world. Recommended! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1344816000,,1282,5.8138297872340425

3970267,5,B002R0ELCY,"In ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"" , the D.C. Comics superheroes face off against parallel Earth counterparts the Crime Syndicate, led by Ultraman, the mob-boss alternate-Superman. However, the real danger lies in the secret plans of Owlman, the other Earth's equivalent of Batman gone bad. Owlman has gone mad in his brilliance and is bent on destroying all reality by using a new doomsday device on yet another parallel Earth he calls Earth Prime, the Earth that determined the existence of all the other versions. It is, as he calls it, the only act that would carry any meaning since it would affect all worlds and not just one out of an infinite number. Can Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and the Flash, with the help of a good Lex Luthor, save all human life as we know it?

Okay, so there are a few questionable plot points in this one, in my opinion. Like, why would destroying Earth Prime destroy all the other Earths it spawned through alternate choices? Wouldn't you have to go back in time before the other Earths came into existence to prevent that course from happening? Maybe I missed something that WAS explained, or maybe I'm just supposed to assume there are details to this that Owlman and Batman understand and chose not to go into explaining. That's cool, I can live with that, because frankly, this film is pretty awesome! With James Woods as Owlman, how can it not be? Most of these DC direct to DVD/Blu movies are awesome, really, but this is among the best. The characters, animation, and the cool concepts like the exploration of parallel world theories and much of Owlman's twisted logic are all awesome. There is a slight bit of corniness with the plotline about Martian Manhunter's romance, and this is largely a problem with dialogue that comes up frequently in animated features. Most of the dialogue in this film is great, but when they try to do certain things or introduce certain types of characters (like the President's daughter here), that's when things sometimes get a bit cheesy in animated films, and this one doesn't escape that. It's hard to pinpoint the issue, and some of it is the voice acting (it's generally believed you have to overact a bit in animation voice acting, something I've never quite agreed with, and when the lines get a little cheesy, I think that's when it really backfires). The main problem with some of the romance dialogue in these films could be that they are using words when action may be the more realistic way to show something, but that is just one theory, and I'm throwing that out in retrospect when I really would have to rewatch to analyze the issue. Actually, the biggest problem is probably the cheesy lines they use, let's be honest. Anyway, putting that aside, as I said, this film is a great one, highly fun and entertaining with fascinating ideas and really cool and sometimes humorous stuff throughout. It's true Justice League, and if you were a fan of the Bruce Timm/Paul Dini animated series, you'll really enjoy this one, which was also produced by Bruce Timm.

The Blu-Ray is excellent and loaded with bonus features. You get an excellent, exclusive DC animated short, ""The Spectre"", animated with a retro, grindhouse feel to it. And though they are really here to get you interested in buying the DVD sets, you also get 4 episodes of the Justice League animated series (A Better World Part 1 and 2, and Twilight Part 1 and 2) and the pilot episode of Wonder Woman. All of them are great fun to watch, although the Justice League episodes looked really bad on an HDTV, even after I adjusted the viewing format to suit their full screen format. ""A Better World was really perfect to accompany this one, as it dealt with an alternate Justice League from a parallel Earth too. Twilight was about Darksied and Braniac. Another great and much appreciated inclusion was the pilot episode of ""Aquaman"", which was a sort of spin-off series of CW's ""Smallville"" (with Aquaman recast with the actor who later played Green Arrow/Oliver Queen on Smallville). I was under the impression the show was going to be titled Mercy Reef (the setting of the show), but it's full on called ""Aquaman"" here. It's not the worst pilot ever, either. Pretty standard CW show stuff from the creators of Smallville. Why it didn't get picked up, I am not sure, though I'm guessing it's because they killed off the really cute girl in the pilot. Why do shows always kill off the cutest girls in the cast? Anyway, really grateful to finally have this show in my collection.

More bonus features included are DCU: The New World, a documentary about current Justice League writers and certain Crisis storylines, and four ""First Look"" featurettes about the other DC Animated Universe features already released or in production at the time of this release: Wonder Woman, Batman:Under the Red Hood, Green Lantern: First Flight, and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I seem to remember Public Enemies being the weakest of the bunch, but then I don't remember it well enough to say for sure. I'll have to pop it in and review it soon. The others are great, I own them all, and Under the Red Hood is particularly awesome. In fact, though I'm a little behind on the more recent of these animated films, I think it's been the best one (or, at least, it is definitely the best from among the ones I've seen). Others in my collection are Superman: Doomsday and Justice League: New Frontier, both excellent as I recall (need to rewatch them, it's been a while), but there have been several more since then. I have Batman: Gotham Knight, an anthology film, but still need to upgrade it to Blu, and then I have some that pre-dated Blu-Ray which varied in quality, from the bigscreen's Batman: Mask of the Phantasm to Superman: Brainiac Attacks and everything inbetween, some on VHS, some on DVD. Need to do some upgrading amongst those too. Point is, there's lots of DC animated feature stuff out there produced directly for the home video market since the days of VHS, and most of it is really, really good, with just a couple of so-so's. I highly recommend getting into them, and this is a fine one to start with, though you could say that about many of them. But, I'd say this is among the best!",1340496000,,6281,4.708181818181818
3970268,4,B002R0ELCY,"Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths is a DC stand alone movie featuring the Crime Syndicate, a dark version of the Justice League from another dimension.  The leader of that world's heroes, a noble Lex Luthor, escapes to our dimension in search of help for a last stand against Ultraman, Owlman, Superwoman, Power Ring and Johnny Quick.

""Evil twin"" stories are obviously nothing new, and the Crime Syndicate has starred in several comics and adaptations.  Crisis on Two Earths does a good job of distinguishing itself though, seeming to take the base idea from Grant Morrison's Earth 2 but dropping some of the sillier aspects, simplifying the plot and building toward a more appropriate ending for a movie version.  The animation is very good and there is plenty of action while retaining a solid progression of events.  A couple of subplots are a bit rushed and some of the large cast could've used more screen time, but it is a hour and fifteen minute movie afterall so these things are somewhat expected.

The voice acting is decent, but has been better in other DC movies.  Some of it isn't the actor's fault, such as the rather poor decision to emphasize the ""syndicate"" part of the Crime Syndicate's name complete with Ultraman being referred to as the ""boss of bosses"" and having a stereotypical mobster voice.

Despite these small points Crisis on Two Earths is a fun movie and an interesting twist on ""evil twin"" stories.",1339804800,,1433,4.820408163265306

3970280,4,B002R0ELCY,"Better than most live-action films. And along with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Under-the-Red-Hood/dp/B003ITZBW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Under the Red Hood</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Beyond-Return-of-the-Joker/dp/B00005Y71K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker</a>', another example of the excellent standalone movies that DC Animated has produced.

As always, the key for any production, regardless of format, is the story - and 'Crisis' delivered in spades. The dialogue and screenplay were very sharp; capturing the essence of the characters, particularly the ever-comical Flash and brooding Batman, in a way that few animated films ever achieve.

The story opens as two familiar, but oddly different, bad guys break into a massive facility. Purpose? Unknown. Lex Luthor and The Jester are making a heck of a go attempting a futuristic snatch-n-grab. But an alarm is triggered and sadly, they both realize their time has run out. Very powerful forces are on their way. The Jester, who looks remarkably like our notorious psychopathic murderer The Joker, activates a hand-held nuke when he's caught; sacrificing himself so that Lex has a chance to escape.

So begins 'Crisis', as we learn that the Lex Luthor in this parallel world is actually one of the good guys and now the last living member of The Justice League. He's desperate to save his world - even if it means taking Alice's route through the looking glass to get help.

A couple of minor criticisms:

- Can't say I like the way they drew Superman - guy looked like a complete tool - both versions of him.

- Personally can't accept anyone other than Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman. Nobody should ever do Batman save that one guy. And if he passes - then we find another actor with the exact same voice. Seriously. I understand that creators want to innovate, but sometimes when you find a home run swing - you stick with it until you can't swing any longer.

Overall, a superior and entertaining animated flick that fairly bursts out of its seventy-five minute screen time.

Personal Notes:

- Was deeply, deeply fascinated with The Owlman - one of the most compelling animated characters  since the elder Bruce Wayne of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Beyond/dp/B003XMZVHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Beyond</a>'. And I just loved that he was voiced by James Woods, the absolutely perfect choice for the pragmatic nihilist of a crimemaster. Just a slightly altered history, a tiny slipped fraction of fate, and what would our world have seen had Bruce's life changed ever so slightly? Terrifying. But nevertheless, a completely engrossing character in my opinion.

Kinda sad his story ended the way it did. Would've loved to screen another film with him. But his end made absolutely perfect sense for the character. Loved that the writers and director didn't cheap out and gave Owlman the only ending that truly befit his character.

- Thought it was really clever how they explained Diana and her plane. :-D

- I'm a solid few decades from having read my last comic book, but I can't help take pleasure in knowing that the classics maintain. After so many upheavals and varying transitions - the core foundation of the best continue to be as fascinating and fulfilling as ever before. A wonderful testament to the strength of the characters and their creators.",1335657600,,3529,5.488929889298893

3970285,5,B002R0ELCY,"Justice League: Crisis on two Earths, A Box of Great things.

The good in a nutshell: Deep ideas from mainstream science fiction. Good animation. Powerful, iconic, action-scenes and tight, intelligent writing. Star-power voice acting.

Justice Leaque: Crisis on two earths is just so well made, it's hard to do it justice. It makes you wonder why DC doesn't do more in the live-action movie business.

Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (from here on, JLCOTE) is very, very good.

With a story derived from an aspect of quantum physics, and edgy philosophical questions, JLCOTE mixes jaw-dropping action sequences, with, well-thought-out pieces of meaning to provide an animated movie that goes beyond whether or not 'x' is going to break through a wall after being punched by 'y'.

JLCOTE shines in many places, but the first of them is its action: how the writers use fight choreography to talk about the heroes and their evil or deranged counterparts.

When you watch JLCOTE, you understand that how the characters fight mirrors their personalities, and histories: Superman and Ultraman are brawlers who have seldom had real opponents who could hurt them and teach them a need for skill or caution. Wonder Woman combines kicks and punches with tricky greco-roman wrestling. Owlman and Batman go after one another with animalic fury, with vicious jujutsu techniques and hidden weapons.

It is impressive to see how much thought the writers put into avoiding all the usual ""fly-and-tackle"" hack-work that turns so many animated fight-scenes into baskets full of yawn.

But if the action is in JLCOTE is great, the thinking is even better: you have to be impressed by how much faith the writers put into their audience's demonstrating brain power.

JLCOTE uses ideas and themes that originally appeared in Larry Niven's, quantum physics-based short story, ""All the Myriad ways"" to create the story's driving conflict between Batman's defining need to create an order, in which people are forced to be good, and the deeper darkness of Owlman's nihilism, a hatred that defines humanity as a problem with a simple and very final, solution.

All in all, JLCOTE is a good story with intense action, high-quality ideas, and stand-out performances (from inter alia: Gina Torres and James Woods).

If you like brilliant things, you should have it.

3970286,4,B002R0ELCY,"Let's begin by discussing the Special Features. There are a number of first looks at other animated films in the DC Universe.

A new Spectre short is included on Disc One.  It's a good story, even though the vigilante aspect is a bit chilling to be included on a Justice League feature since the Spectre is both judge and jury with no recourse for appeal.

On Disc Two Bruce Timm presents A Better World where the Justice Lords from a parallel earth imprison the Justice League because they believe the Justice League needs to be shown how to deal with criminals and crime. I would give A Better World five stars.

I found Crisis On Two Earths to be a bit lacking in story and animation. There were some good moments.

The conversation and fight between Batman and Owlman on Earth Prime was probably the best part of the film.  Owlman explains to Batman his theory why there were so many earths and why Earth Prime had to be destroyed to cleanse the Universe of humans.  To destroy Earth Prime is to destroy all earths according to Owlman's theory.

The touching love story between J'onn J'onzz and Rose Wilson, daughter of the USA President, is well done.  Getting to know you takes on a whole new dimension in the Maritain style of a mind kiss.

There're plenty of fights.  It was good to see Lex Luthor playing a good guy and the sole remaining member of his world Justice League.

Lex and Batman being the non-super-humans in this bunch took as good as they gave.  Well trained humans can fight super villains. President Wilson finally proved to his daughter that his war hero status was not a fluke.

This is worth buying for the Special Features.  The 75-minute film could have been better.  Three stars for the film and four stars for the Special Features.",1329177600,,1763,4.549206349206349

3970288,5,B002R0ELCY,"The Justice League finally meets a foe worthy of it -- themselves, or rather, their evil alter-egos from a parallel earth.  This concept (Earth-3, dominated by villainous super-folk) was first explored in the 1964 JLA comic crossover series with the Justice Society and the Crime Syndicate, and has been updated and expanded for this original story.  The twist opening -- where we see an unexpected set of heroes -- launches an exciting, tense, action-packed adventure that threatens ALL the multiple earths and challenges the Justice League to their limits.

A huge cast of characters is adroitly presented without bogging down the plotline or defying logic (comic book logic, at least).  Usually these super-team scripts become pretentious or confused, but the action here  is crisp and clever and the characterization is sharp focused and fascinating.  Batman and Owlman in particular match wits in a duel only one can win, while the seductive but wicked Superwoman is a worthy foe for any of the Justice Leaguers.  Luthor, of all people,  demonstrates a surprising savvy and an unlikely ""Joker""  makes a brief but memorable appearance.

An outstanding achievement, and an ideal comic book movie to show to friends who might not normally like a comic book movie. (If only the live action films were this intelligent and engaging.)

I remember watching that ""Better World"" episode and thinking how evil the other world counterparts of Super Man and company were, but boy were they slightly stern compared to the other world doppelgangers portrayed in this!!

The story here is solid and the production values of the animation, story, and tone are very cinematic. This is a real movie, folks, you'll be forgetting this is a cartoon before it gets past the first half hour. The character choices are the key to making this a success. Some had to hold true to who they are, but others had to surprise you. As an avid fan of all of the Justice league tv shows, I wasn't expecting to be surprised by any of the characters, even the doppelgangers; I figured they'd be evil and the others good. It is that way, but the little touches are what make the difference here. I'll go on record as saying that at least two characters will throw you for a complete loop as to just how ""different"" they are portrayed. One character is the complete opposite of herself and the opposite's unshakable determination to be bad only amplifies and pin points, like I've never seen before, the original's resolve to be good. The character that most surprised me however was Batman. The series so far has gone to great lengths to paint him as stern and anti social, which I always got it, but this movie takes the character far beyond just a personality type. You see growth in him and gain a greater understanding of who he is...possibly beyond just the series, but how he was meant to be originally (whoa).

Evil Super Man is the comic relief and doesn't illuminate anything about the series Super Man or resemble him in any way, which is what is so funny! The Evil Super Man is basically a (spoiler) and he's created a (spoiler). Now, I mention the term ""prospects"", just to put something in your ear.

Prospects are lower level recruits in motor cycle gangs who must ""prove"" their worth. The DC writers could have gone this route, which a biker gang Justice League would have been something to say the least. They could have also fashioned the league to be cops (scary cops, like Judge Dread cops), or a religious sect hold up in a Justice Fortress ""Church"" with a pious contrite Super Man residing over and protecting his team's dirty dealings under the veal of religious purity. LOL, I'm dying over this as I write it. I also get a kick imagining the DC team kicking these ideas around. However, they settled on what they did and it is a great choice; it's a menacing angle. The Biker Gang idea could have gotten too violent and the church angle could have gotten too HEAVY!

I digress though. Wait until you see him, this Super Man is a hoot. The other character's doppelgangers are really just glib or funny re imaginings, like other world Flash is really not so different from the series Flash except he (spoiler), Green lantern's counterpart looks to be (spoiler), and Martian Man Hunter's and Hulk Girl's counterparts are drawn to be more (spoiler) than alien.

3970320,3,B002R0ELCY,"When I started to watch this feature I was pretty excited but I have to admit that three quarters of the way through it kinda of died for me.  It quite simply just fell off for me, Crisis on Two Earths is one of DC's most noted graphic novels and I believe that this feature didn't do it enough justice.  All around it was an ok feature but I feel like the characters didn't have enough involvement in the end, grant it when Batman decided that he was the only one who could stop Owlman is usually what you expect from Batman but I think Batman should have been a litte more cunning, the movie made him out to be kind of secondary and for me that's not what I like to see with such a great, long-standing presence that Batman has had in these features.  Also, William Baldwin I believe was not a correct fit for the character.",1296259200,,826,4.182389937106918
3970321,3,B002R0ELCY,"I somewhat enjoyed ""Public Enemies"", and ""Under the Red Hood"" is by far the best feature ever, but this edition really could have used some work. It has the same problems as a lot of its predecessors, delivering solely action and a pretty basic plot outline of the much deeper graphic novel. This was pathetic to me, because the premise was pretty promising. Not only that, but Batman spends 90% of his time in the movie getting his ass handed to him, which was insulting really. Chris North, Mark Harman, and William Baldwin, all were decent, but nothing compared to Kevin Conroy or Tim Daly. Although give credit where credit is due concerning James Hood, who did pretty damn good throughout as Owlman.

If you're around 10 this will be the best thing you've ever seen, but if you were born in the 90s or older then it will pass off as mediocre.",1295481600,,847,4.5359477124183005
3970322,2,B002R0ELCY,the story is so so. Batman looks really ugly too. Don't like the ending of the Flash of the other dimension either.,1295049600,,115,4.2727272727272725
3970323,2,B002R0ELCY,"The movie really had a lot going for it.  The idea of an alternate Batman (Owlman) who was never a good man is an excellent one; and Superwoman and Owlman are quite compelling.
The movie really revolves around Superwoman, Owlman and Batman, and the particular mental instability of the two primary villains is disturbingly believable.  The writing flows smoothly and doesn't jar.
But in spite of these strong advantages, ultimately I thought the movie was something of a flop.  Other than the three mentioned, the other characters are mostly filler, and as good as Batman in some ways is in this one, the voice was utterly and completely wrong (perhaps chosen to sound very similar to Owlman's).  The use of characters who serve no real purpose (Martian Manhunter) and acquire no real development acts as a brake on opening up the genuine dramatic possibilities offered by the situation.  Had this been a Batman movie, rather than a Justice League movie, and had Kevin Conroy or Bruce Greenwood played Batman, it could well have been one of the best animated movies; but bad acting and a failure to excise irrelevant material severely weakened the film to the point of disappointment.
I think the root of the failure is that they took a clearly conceived Owlman, and used him as the base for Batman, modifying him just enough to be a pretty dark hero; whereas, given audience familiarity with Batman, the reverse procedure would have made more sense.  Indeed, the reverse procedure does seem like what they did with Superwoman: they took Wonder Woman and twisted her enough to really become a sadistic villain - and the scene where she snaps Batman's rib is one of the two most memorable in the movie.  But the other villians, indeed, the other heroes, don't have much of a defined character, and certainly were not genuinely alternate versions of their putative counterparts.  If they had taken with everyone the approach they took with Wonder Woman/Superwoman it would have been a much more significant work.",1294012800,3,2010,4.908554572271386

3970325,5,B002R0ELCY,"Once again DC has put out a great movie with story and action throughout. This one makes you think as it takes you on a journey through parallel earths. It's a branch from the Infinite Earths crisis in the comics and reminds viewers of the Justice Lords episode in Justice League season 2. It's a darker plot line than most animated films, but since these movies are made for adults, that makes sense. It is a good journey throughout and would recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Justice League, the DC movies, or comics in general.",1293494400,,532,4.552083333333333

Honestly I'm kind of tired of seeing them rehash episode ideas into standalone movies.

I know I've seen an episode of Justice League where the Justice League from an alternate universe started ruling with an iron fist after Flash was killed and Superman decided murder was an acceptable means to end a situation then come into conflict with the straight and narrow JLA we all know. Yeah basically take that idea, turn the alt. universe JLA into an organized crime syndicate where batman has watched Watchmen one time too many and decided the only thing cooler than Night Owl and Rorschach is Night Owl merged with Rorschach and happens to be a villain. Throw in the obligatory ""destroy all universes"" plot and that's basically what this movie is.

The ""good"" justice league show up, and try to save the day.  Doesn't really sound that interesting, and isn't at the begining.  But about half way through the movie, the story gets more focused, the lines of morality a bit more blurred, and Batman gets a little more awesome.  I don't want to ruin it for you, but I was sufficiently thrilled with the second half to buy the movie to watch again.  Though I can't call it perfect, its a pretty good movie.

3970335,4,B002R0ELCY,"Over all, this was a really fun movie to watch. The action was amazing and well animated, I mean well animated. It's nice to see DC really putting good effort into deeper, darker more adult story lines and action as well as spending a few extra bucks on much better animation. My only issue with this movie was some of the voice actors. William Baldwin as batman? Seriously....William Baldwin? The voice just didn't fit and it showed in every line batman had. Mark Harmon as superman was good but it wasn't quite there for me but it still `worked' unlike the voice of batman. Other than that the movie was spot on and it is a welcome treat to see DC taking batman to darker areas than before, how he handles the owl and the evil flash is.....unexpected perfection. The fight sequences were well done as well with the chaos well spread out and not focusing on just one or two heroes and it all flowed well imo. Great movie with lots of good action. Good for a watch in my opinion.",1286582400,,979,4.384615384615385
3970336,3,B002R0ELCY,"This was good. To me it was not as good as Superman Doomsday, that one was awesome. This one played like a regular season episode were they meet there doubles and battle it out. It was cool to see the alternate versions of some sub characters here and there like, Hawk Girl, Joker, Static Shock and some others. It reminded me of Kingdom Come the comic book. Action scenes were not disappointing. Superman gives it and gets it, Wonder Woman had some good fight scenes as well. DC has really been stepping up on the animated cartoons but this one just seems like it was borrowed from the unlimited series. Like it, but story not so original. If you have the series and other movies you will want to add this to your collection. Great action, characters but re-hashed story.",1285804800,,772,4.521428571428571

3970348,4,B002R0ELCY,"I don't know why I was so skeptical of this movie, at first, because Warner Brothers has not disappointed me yet.  The voice acting was my main concern and afte watching the film, twice, I can say that the entire cast did very well.  Batman was my biggest worry and William Baldwin did a very good job.  Of course, he is hardly in the movie at all, until the end, and even when he is present he doesn't say very much.

Although haven't read that many comics, I'm really interested in all comic book characters and I really enjoy being able to see new characters in animation.  While they don't really give you much backstory on the villains, it was interesting to watch the Crime Syndicate in action and their minions (evil counterparts of the expanded Justice League, i.e. Black Canary, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Vixen, and many others that I can't remember).  It's also fun to see Lex Luthor and the Joker (known as the Jokester on Qward) as good guys.

The story was good, although as with most WB/DC films, a bit too short.  It felt a little rushed.  I also feel that they could have explained just a little more about the Crime Syndicate.  The fight scenes were exciting and fun to watch and there's even a bit of romance for one of the Justice League members, which I found unnecessary but I'm sure some people will enjoy it.

I was again disappointed with the special features.  There is a featurette on the comic books with interviews of DC's writers and illustrators.  I'm sure that loyal comic book readers would find this very interesting but as a casual fan, I found it a bit boring.  There are previews for all the other DC movies (nothing new that I can remember).  The Silver Specter short was very good.  Done in 1970's style with a kind of gritty look, I thought the animation was amazing and Gary Cole was great as the main character.

Overall, I enjoyed this release and look forward to the next one.  I just wish that WB would get back on track with their special features.",1285113600,,1990,4.480555555555555
3970349,4,B002R0ELCY,"This was a fun & entertaining movie.  I was a big fan of Green Lantern: First Flight, and I liked The New Frontier pretty well.  This one was well paced, and the fight scenes (specifically the first one) were top notch.  Overall, the voice actors did a nice job.  Gina Torres was great as Superwoman.  James Woods was a good Owlman, and Lex & Flash were also noteable.  I didn't so much have a problem with Batman as a lot of reviewers here do (though Kevin Conroy is still the best).  I wasn't a fan of Mark Harmon as Superman.  It just didn't seem to fit and seemed awkward at best.

Overall, this is a really good film that is well worth your time.",1285113600,,651,4.185483870967742
3970350,4,B002R0ELCY,"I liked the movie but what I'm not getting why there really needed to be two discs? I mean one disc had a deeper look into the DCU that New Frontier had kinda explored then there was a JL episode, which was cool to see how the show did touch on the two earth theme. What I missed and was looking forward to was the commentary part. Where was that at and why was it not here? I never bought the two disc stuff but when I bought Public Enemies and there wasn't a commentary part on the single disc I figured maybe I need to start buying the two disc sets. The movie in itself is great, I liked it I watched it three times in row. I am starting to wish the movies were longer since they are now having way better scripts and stories in general. Again my only complaint is the lack of a commentary would have been nice to the behind the scenes, I'm a geek like that.",1283990400,,862,3.9884393063583814
3970351,5,B002R0ELCY,"What a great episode of Justice League, huh? I don't care what the producers behind these movies say, this is the bridge between JL and JLU. Of course there are some cosmetic differences but they're too few. The difference? A different Green Lantern is present, the rebuilt Watchtower looks slightly different than the one that would appear in JLU and Batman, Martian Manhunter & Aquaman look different. My explanations for some of these discrepancies? John Stewart went away after Hawkgirl's betrayal so the Guardians sent Hal Jordan or Kyle Rayner (its never stated who it is) as his temporary replacement while J'onn's new look could be attributed to a Martian style of mourning (note the black costume). Other than that, yeah its pretty much the DCAU. There's just too many similarities for it not to be linked to it. Though while Power Ring & Johnny Quick don't get much screen time and Ultraman is just a stereotypical Mafia boss, Superwoman and Owlman are given more development; Superwoman for her sexual thrill of combat & power and Owlman for his cold, calculating genius and general disregard and uninterest for all reality. The Syndicate subordinates were fun and I enjoyed trying to figure out who was their JL counterpart.

Again nothing but praise for the voice cast, who pretty much nailed their parts. While the animation models looked the same, the cast was able to take the characters and make them their own. Mark Harmon's Superman sounds a little older and wiser than George Newbern's interpretation. Like Jeremy Sisto in New Frontier, William Baldwin (Miss Romano must also like working with the Baldwin family, it'd be kind of cool if she could get all the Baldwin Brothers in a project like this. If Alec could do Spongebob, he could do something like this) gives a more gravelly performance as the Dark Knight (I was also surprised at how little Batman's even in this until the end). Though again the praise goes to the actors of Superwoman and Owlman. Gina Torres (the voice of Vixen in JLU) was excellent, ably portraying the deadliness and sexuality of the character. James Woods portrays Owlman with a dry sense of humor and makes him a genuine threat, both against the Justice League and the Multi-Verse.",1280102400,,2234,4.894459102902375
3970352,4,B002R0ELCY,"Based on Grant Morrison's JLA: Earth 2, the Crisis on Two Earths story beams us to an alternate dimension where Lex Luthor is the hero and the ""superheroes"" are evildoers called ""The Crime Syndicate"".  When a heroic Lex Luthor from an alternate timeline transports himself to our Earth to beg for help, the Justice League decides to return with him and kick some serious butt.  Traveling to Earth-2, our heroes Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, (and eventually Batman), encounter their alternate (and thoroughly evil) selves. Evenly-matched but quickly outnumbered, the Justice League must find a way to defeat their sinister counterparts.  But the clock begins ticking when Owlman (Batman's alternate) makes a discovery that could threaten not only Earth-2, but all existence.

Crisis on Two Earths showcases the highest stakes I have ever seen, in any film, ever.  Crisis dares to deliver a plotline that's epic in scope while maneuvering around most of the pitfalls that come with such an attempt.  The characterization is quite good, especially considering they had two entire teams to develop.  The evil Superwoman and Flash are notably good, while Owl-Man's character (voiced by James Woods) is absolute genius.  The Crisis villains are interesting and threatening, the stakes high, and the fighting awesome.  Wonder Woman and Owlman have some fantastically well-choreographed fights.  Crisis' only major pitfall is the voices for our heroes.  It doesn't bring back any of the familiar voices from the TV Series or other animated movies.  It's not that Crisis has bad actors, far from it, but the change is hard to get used to.  I liked Superman (Mark Harmon) having a Kansas accent, but Batman (William Baldwin) was ineffective as the Dark Knight.  Couple that with a ton of good and evil superhero incarnations and it all gets a little hard to follow.  (Although that Aquaman cameo was pretty sweet.)  I wouldn't say its script or storytelling is weak, per se, it just lacks the pacing and consistency of the best animated features like Public Enemies.
Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths is a success in it's high stakes action and unique setting.  A spectacular showdown between Batman and Owlman with a quote from Nietzsche lands it solidly in the `Great' section of my list.",1278720000,,2299,5.10427807486631

3970355,4,B002R0ELCY,"I was extremely happy to see the Crime Syndicate getting the full star treatment in a DC's latest animated movie as I've been a huge fan of theirs for decades. The Crime Syndicate was created by Gardner Fox way back in 1964 in the original two part `Crisis on Earth Three'. It wasn't a perfect story but the idea of an alternate universe with the heroes and villains reversed was a goldmine of potential. Perhaps even more intriguing was the idea of an Earth where the villains rule. The Crime Syndicate was given the opportunity to do what no DC villain could ever do and that's win; not temporarily win but continue to control Earth Three and essentially keep it enslaved. Earth Three is even more terrifying than Darkseid's bleak Apokolips because it maintains the faade of normalcy. However even the president of the United States can do nothing when Ultraman (Superman's opposite) walks into the White House and threatens his life. Gardner Fox also did a great job of creating the alternate characters with completely different origins and unique personalities. I particularly enjoy Batman's opposite, Owlman, who may be even more brilliant and resourceful than the Dark Knight himself. Ultraman by contrast is the ultimate bully which is probably a more likely outcome of someone with Superman like powers than ending up a boy scout. Earth Three was so influential that it was used as one of the primary driving forces behind both Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis.

The movie opens with Earth Three's Lex Luthor and The Jester (a good guy Joker) invading the Crime Syndicate's base to steal some important piece of technology. Luthor manages to escape and opens a door to the parallel Earth One where he implores the JLA to help him fight against the Crime Syndicate. The movie expands greatly on the roster of the CSA which originally featured just five members including Ultraman, Superwoman, Johnny Quick, Power Ring and of course Owlman. The big five remain in charge but now they each have dozens of lieutenants that are all reverses of Earth One heroes. This is not the first time other characters have been shown but Crisis on Two Earths probably has the most expanded roster.

The movie is very good but not without flaws. My biggest issue was the casting of voice actors and one in particular. They went with name actors rather than the actors from the cartoons and Billy Baldwin was completely miscast as Batman. His voice is neither intimidating nor authoritative. I'm not sure how I feel about James Woods as Owlman with his nasally delivery. He sounds kind of nerdy but maybe that was what they were going for. Baldwin gets a failing grade but otherwise the voice acting was decent. The script is very intelligently written but one plot point seemed silly. The JLA meets with the president and implores him to stand up to the Crime Syndicate and the President gives the completely logical response that if they do that the Syndicate will kill them all and notes that unlike Superman they're not bulletproof. Superman replies saying that he stands up to foes stronger than himself all the time but that argument is silly. Ultraman isn't merely stronger than the President or the Secret Service he is a homicidal Superman. If the President stands up to Ultraman he will absolutely unequivocally be killed. When Superman tells the president that they will take care of the Syndicate the president responds with the most powerful line of the movie asking, `Will you kill them?' This dialogue between Superman and the President is very well written but at the same time completely nave. The fact of the matter is that the Crime Syndicate has gone easy on Earth Three allowing the people some sense of normalcy and even apparently a pseudo democracy. What Superman is asking is for the president to essentially commit suicide. Grant Morrison came across this situation in JLA: Earth 2 and resolved it by creating some kind of cosmic balance that would only allow Earth Three to be saved at the expense of Earth One and the book ended with the Crime Syndicate retaining control. This is not the route the movie takes. One interesting idea that isn't explored is the whole idea of the `Crime' Syndicate operating as a criminal organization. If you can walk into the White House and threaten the President you don't need to commit crimes. You've won. In the movie the Syndicate is kept slightly in check by the threat of nuclear bombs but it seems dubious to think that the U.S. could somehow target individual members of the CSA for a nuclear strike. And would even that kill Ultraman or Power Ring?

My final issue was with the nefarious plan of Owlman. The one big issue I had with the 1989 Batman movie was that the Joker's plan was pointless outside of killing as many people as possible. Even if I bought into the idea that the Joker was just a homicidal nihilist why would his henchmen go along with it? Owlman's plan is essentially the same but on a far grander scale. His motivation is philosophically intriguing but probably more than a younger fan might be expected to digest.

Despite my issues Crisis on Two Earths it's a very well done production and the actions scenes are phenomenal. The animators do an awesome job of capturing fights between beings of unfathomable power. There were also some little touches that I really enjoyed. Superwoman has three lieutenants that to the best of my knowledge are never named but it's clearly Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr. and Uncle Marvel. Yeah, Uncle Marvel. Seeing that fat, white haired Uncle Marvel beating down the JLA is magnificent.

I really enjoyed Crisis on Two Earth but a few plot problems were just too much for me to award it a full five stars. There are a lot of idea's that could have been explored but weren't and other extraneous storylines that could have been jettisoned (The Martian Manhunter's romance). Ultimately it's a really good direct to video movie but just not up to the level of a Pixar or Miyazaki movie.",1276473600,,6020,4.7846153846153845
3970356,4,B002R0ELCY,"Justice League: Crisis on Two-Earths is the latest original DC animated film and takes on a legacy that is forty years in the making.  The idea of parallel Earths has been a staple in DC continuity since the advent of the Silver Age of comics when it was decided that the Golden Age and Silver Age Superheroes came from different Earths.  Longtime DC writer Gardner Fox penned the first ""Crisis"" story involving the parallel worlds way back Justice League of America #29-30, in 1964.  Since then, Crisis has become a regular plotline in DC comics...some may say its even an obsession.

In this story, the Crime Syndicate is an evil version of the Justice League.  They control their Earth in an organized crime manner with each of the core members controlling a territory with a ""family"" of under-villains to help enforce their rule.  Here, Lex Luthor is one of the last superheroes alive and he uses a dimensional transporter to travel to the Earth of the JLA and enlist their aid to save his world.

While most of the League is in favor, Batman refuses, believing they have more important tasks on their own world.  Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, and J'onn J'onzz travel with Luthor back to his world to confront the villains.  Here they will not only fight their own evil counterparts, but also evil versions of heroes such as The Marvel Family, Green Arrow, The Elongated Man, and Vibe.  But a more serious threat is soon uncovered...Owlman, the parallel to Batman is hatching a plot that could destroy the entire universe.

One of the strengths of DCs animated films over those of Marvel's is their use of well-known actors to voice the characters.  This works both for and against DC in this film, however.  The familiar voices of Kevin Conroy and Rino Romano as Batman, and Tim Daly and George Newbern as Superman, have been replaced by William Baldwin (Batman) and Mark Harmon (Superman).  Baldwin is passable as Batman but Harmon just doesn't sound right.  His voice doesn't have the power and authoritative tone you expect from Superman.  On the other hand, James Woods is brilliant as Owlman.  He single-handedly raises the bar for the other actors with his voice that oozes sinister evil.  Chris Noth is fine as Lex Luthor but you definitely miss Clancy Brown's deep resonations.  Another notable actors include Bruce Davison as the alternate Earth President and Kari Wuhrer as Black Canary.

Justice League: Crisis on Two-Earths is a solid story although not quite on a par with Green Lantern: First Flight or Superman/Batman Public Enemies.  It plays like an extended episode of the Justice League TV show with nothing truly making it momentous.

The DVD also comes with a short animated feature starring The Spectre and I'm tempted to say this is worth the price of the DVD alone.  The Spectre is the most important DC character yet to appear in animation.  The story is written by Steve Niles is largely influenced by the 1970s incarnation of the Specter in Adventure Comics, written by Michael Fleisher with art by Jim Aparo.  This was a Spectre that dealt with criminal in the most gruesome fashion and Niles has brought that style to this short.  It's even set in the 1970s with Jim Corrigan as the Spectre, trying to track down the murderers of a top Hollywood film producer.

The acting is fantastic, the show itself is perfectly well produced with a grand story.  The only thing wrong was that the special features on this DVD were not that good, the previews gave more behind the scenes and special features materials than these discs do.  So I would buy the one disc or Blu-ray.  Still, great show, can't say enough good things about it.

3970360,4,B002R0ELCY,"Overall this was a strong entry in the ever-expanding line of DC animated features. Its main downfall, to my obsessive mind, is its somewhat shabby treatment of my favorite hero, Green Lantern.

The first line GL has begins with ""For all my power..."" Sadly, in the rest of this film, he rarely demonstrates this power. He never really steps up, has little to say, and never does anything really remarkable or impressive. In his first battle, he is completely dominated by the evil Marvels, who effortlessly plow through his shields to get at him. Later, these same Marvels who made such light work of Green Lantern are punched around by relative lightweights like Aquaman. If Green Lantern is so helpless against these underlings, you have to wonder what chance he'd have against any of the main members of the Crime Syndicate, unless it's his own counterpart, Power Ring. He even has trouble handling evil Halo, of all people.

GL is generally considered the second most powerful member of the JLA, after Superman. In the early comics, it was usually Hal who would, at the critical moment, do something ingenious and unexpected with his ring that would turn the tide and save the day. There's no sign of that here. He shows no initiative and no personality. They might even have remembered that Hal is one of the world's greatest pilots when Owl Man's plane becomes available.

My main consolation in this is that Batman is stripped of the weird mantle of invincibility which has clung to him in recent years. I enjoyed seeing him manhandled by opponents who are vastly superior to him. He is just a guy in a suit, after all.",1273017600,,1626,4.738515901060071
3970361,4,B002R0ELCY,"Originally meant to be the lead-in from Justice League to Justice League Unlimited, Crisis On Two Earths was rewritten to be the first genuine movie of the JLA. Where as The New Frontier was more of a Silver Age story where the characters all got together in the end, this one has the League already formed in it. Although the word ""crisis"" in the title might give off illusions of epic crossovers featuring heroes from every timeline, the story only deals with the regular DC universe and one parallel to theirs. Also, this movie has no connection to any of the other previous DC Universe animated movies.

The Justice League as we now it has just recently set up business in this storyline, but unlike most other animated versions in recent years, Hal Jordan is the Green Lantern in this group. They are visited by a good Lex Luthor from an alternate reality where he is the surviving member of his world's superheroes. There, the JLA are the Crime Syndicate, with evil counterparts to Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and so on. Luthor convinces the League to come back with him to defeat the Syndicate. They manage to take down a few of the Syndicate's sub-groups, as well as Ultraman(evil Superman), which turns out to be ultimately pointless as they are all released from prision because of the hold that they have on this world. After chatting with President Slade(aka: Deathstroke or ""Slade"" from Teen Titans), Martian Manhunter forms yet another one of the weird pairings that the DC animated stories have with its characters by dating the Chelsea Clinton of this universe, who is really Ravager back home. Batman's evil twin of Owlman meanwhile plans to use Luthor's dimensional-hopping tech to create a doomsday device that will destroy every universe once he locates Earth-Prime, the Earth that all other realities stem from. Batman is able to stop him in time, and order is restored to the counter-world. On their return, the JLA opens up their doors to some new members.

This movie like the other DC Universe productions was produced by Bruce Timm, plus Super Friends alumni Alan Burnett. The original concept was written by Dwayne McDuffie from Static Shock and Ben 10. The animation is pretty standard of the previous DC DVDs, of which the character designs are similar too. There aren't any of the regular voice actors you're used to though in it, although Gina Torres as the sultry Superwoman(evil Wonder Woman)and James Woods as the sadistic Owlman absolutely steal the show. It's refreshing to see some of the DC heroes featured that they've never animated before, like Looker and Halo, even if its is their evil counterparts. The special edition DVD and Blu-Ray also has a bonus segment they'll be adding to future releases of Showcase where they do a short film of some of the lesser-exposed comics characters, this time around with an awesome grindhouse-like take on The Spectre. I'd recommend this one to all comics fans and superhero fanatics!",1272931200,,2968,4.886904761904762

The story, written by Dwayne McDuffie, a talent writer I really admire, is solid in every respect.

3970366,3,B002R0ELCY,"I'm not going to give this DC Title a glowing review. I'm a real fan of animation, but I think that this one really missed its mark. I'm a big fan of animation --you can see my other reviews and tell that for yourself. The voice acting was great, and the animation was excellent as well. The things that truly bothered me about this movie is that it felt like they were trying to do two stories at once and falling short. The Crime Syndicate story OR Crisis on Infinite Earths. Pick one and stick with it. After 30 years of reading DC comics, it just feels like the studios are really thinking too small when it comes to animated features. Each of these stories in their own right need to be told, but as they were written, not making things up and borrowing things from this story or the other.

That's what this feels like. I will say this --if I'd never read comics as a kid, then the movie wouldn't have bothered me at all. So if you're not a serious comic book fan, watch away. Even if you are a comic book fan, if you put aside your fanboyness for a little while, it was an entertaining movie. But after its over, I felt cheated of the story that I remember reading. I honestly wish that DC would stop letting studios re-write stories just to suit the production and make them stay true to the original plot. I don't mind it when they change things for the sake of different time periods like slang or dialog, but come on. There's a reason the story was popular enough to make into a movie --so stop messing with it!

That's really all I have to say. Again, if you're buying this for your kid, then by all means --I don't think they'll be disappointed. But if you're a DC aficionado like me, then you might want to skip this one if plot deviations upset you.",1271376000,2,1764,4.247023809523809

Mark Harmon and William Baldwin are excellent actors but in these roles they felt flat ,they were missing something and you can feel it while watching the film. If the DC folks would have been smart they would have used Kevin Conroy & Tim Daley for these parts instead of Superman/Batman: Public Enemies it would have been probably DC best Project to Date But Chris North as Luthor and A Super performance  by James Woods as Olwman saves it.

3970397,4,B002R0ELCY,"Owlman was awesome.  James Woods did a superb job with the role.  Gina Torres was a phenomenal Superwoman.  I hope she accepts more voiceover roles in the future.  Brian Bloom's portrayal of Ultraman reminded me of the Crime Syndicate's appearances in the Justice League comics.

William Baldwin did a good job as Batman given the script he was presented.  Andrea Romano made a wise decision saving Kevin Conroy's vocal talents for a Batman or Justice League movie with a script equal to or greater than Superman/Batman:  Public Enemies.  I enjoyed the romance between Manhunter and Rose Wilson.  It showed how emotionally complicated it can be for a hero to visit a parallel Earth similar to ours.

The only negative was Mark Harmon's portrayal of Superman.  I watched the movie three times and could not accept him as the voice of the most powerful member of the Justice League.  George Newburn should have been asked to reprise the role.

I would recommend this movie to Justice League fans.  The Two-Disc version is sufficient.  The Blu-ray DVD does not have to be purchased in order for fans to appreciate the animation.",1269993600,,1125,4.878306878306878

3970411,5,B002R0ELCY,"...and the Spectre short is just as good.

This hour and ten minute feature is loosely based on the two part ""Crisis on Earth Three"" story in Justice League of America #29 and #30 back in the '60s. Having watched the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited DVD sets I fairly jumped on this one.

I'm pleased to say that that this is a very fine effort. There is substantial evidence that this was produced some years ago. The lack of a Hawkgirl and the hint of a membership drive place it squarely between the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited seasons.

The plot is relatively straightforward. Lex Luthor, the sole surviving member of the Justice League on his world, comes to the ""our"" Justice League's world for help against the super powered Crime Syndicate (doppelgangers of the Justice League). But the Crime Syndicate's Owl Man has his own agenda...

The story is exciting and action packed. It's well acted, despite missing some of the regular voices. Perhaps it wasn't voiced over until much later? Especially good are the scenes with Owl Man and Superwoman.

The Spectre short is very moody and atmospheric. I thought there might be something wrong with my DVD or TV but the phony defects are for effect only.

3970417,5,B002R0ELCY,"Being an older follower of the Justice League since comic books, I was used to the voices of Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly as the icon voices of Batman and Superman in the original animated series.  When I heard Conroy and Daly would retire from doing the voice over, I have to admit I felt like I had just lost my best friend.  It was bad enough that Batman was ALMOST killed in Batman/Superman Public Enemies...  They had to uproot our icon performers!!  What an outrage!!  BUT, being a die hard fan, we gave this new movie a try.  I have to say, the new movie follows the original stories and adds content for this YouTube generation that's still faithful to the original series.  I didn't particularly like young Baldwin's performance as Batman, but I can live with it.  He'll never be the same as listening to Kevin Conroy say the famous line ""I am vengeance, I am BATMAN!"" but gave the character its due respect.  As for Mark Harmon's Superman, I liked the treatment!!  My kids like his performance as Leroy Jethro Gibbs on NCIS (free advertising for the series), so it was a surprise to them, and to myself to hear his voice as Superman.  I was impressed.

Anytime you get to see ""doubles"" of the main characters, it's a plus and this movie didn't disappoint in that regard.  Seeing Luthor as a genuine hero (although it wasn't ""our"" Luthor) was so nice and showed a side we seldom get to see some ""our"" heroes and villians.  I had to watch it a couple of times though to see a couple of nice ""easter eggs"" and ""fan service"" references written into the story and the characterizations of the Crime Syndicate were nice to see.

I wish there would have been more fight scenes but the movie itself was very watchable.  After seeing more of Owlman I think it is safe to say that he needs his own movie to tell his story on how he became the man that he is.  My only gripe is (and yes I am one of those people)Batman is just not Batman without Kevin Conroy doing his voice.

3970433,4,B002R0ELCY,"Justice League new movie ""Crisis on two earths"" is a really good project. The picture quality and the sound are superb. The story is quite interesting but the voice acting has it ups and downs. The tecnical aspects shows how animation has evolved and it's funny how us adults are day by day more into animation (of course it has a deep root in our childhood when we dreamed and fantasize about those heroes!). The story although it colud be more ambituos it was engaging enough and well executed (for the most part). Although leaving Luthor in the Watchtower without supervision was not a smart move. The fights are SPECTACULAR!!!! Being the most exciting and well coreograph the showdown between Wonder Woman and Superwoman, AWESOME! I have always been a Wonder Woman fan and although I was satisfied for the most part in how she was portrait in JL & JLU I think that finally she has been shown as William Moulton created her; a true and fierceless warrior but with a compassion heart! Batman is presented in a realistic way, he is the biggest hero at heart but since he is only human he has his limitation and can't compete physically with superbeings as Superwoman who owned him good! Superman didn't impress me at all, Flash is always fresh and entertaining and Green Lantern bored me to death, he didn't stand out at all!

The voice acting, completely uneven! Miss Romano, is something isn't broke don't fix it! No one embrace Batman as Kevin Conroy. This Batman sounds old, tired, with no sparks, like an old man in a ventilator, BAD CHOICE! Superman was not that bad but Tim Daly is ten times better! Although I LOVE how Wonder Woman was portray here, Susan Eisenberg voice was a better fit (to me the best! She has that royal attitude in her voice) even Kerry Russell was better. Some people has been complaining about not having Clancy Brown as Luthor, let me tell you this isn't our bad Luthor so it can't be deceiving and sneaky as ours. But hands down the best of the movie are Owlman (James Wood) and Superwoman (Gina Torres) both are phenomenal. He is dark, creepy but not too evident, she is FEISTY! She is my favorite in the movie, her voice is so warm and compelling she transmit a lot of emotions. I gave it 4 stars because I hated this Batman, HATED IT! As I said was completely flat and Green Lanter was boring. But I love the movie as a whole, GOOD WORK and please don't delay anymore the Wonder Woman live action movie, I believe it's time!

3970434,4,B002R0ELCY,"I enjoyed watching JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS BLU-RAY but I wish that these features would take the action a step further into realism. I know that these movies are targeted toward a young audience but on some of the fight scenes, though brilliant and action packed, our heroes don't get too messed up, if at all, though they take a serious beating. Their costumes don't even show any wear and tear! I'm not asking for blood and gore and I know that these are super-humans, but give us a little more.

Something along the lines like the included special ""The Spectre."" In it, the bad guys get cut up and there's blood, not in excess, but enough to lend a little credulity to the scenes.

The story is about two parallel universes where, on one universe, the Justice League stands for good, and on the other, the heroes are actually bad and are gang lords. Lex Luthor from the alternate universe is actually a good guy and he comes to get help from the good Justice League to stop the bad ones, one rogue in particular, who is trying to annihilate all universes so that nothing exists.

Aquaman, Black Canary, Red Tornado, and Firestorm make appearances so ""Crisis..."" is a cool, action packed movie that should satisfy most comic fans.

The Blu-Ray  edition is jam packed with extras!

3970436,5,B002R0ELCY,"It seems there are two dimensions which is ours and another one which is very similar but way way different. The other dimension's good Lex Luthor (Voiced by Chris Noth) has come to our Earth to seek the help of such Justice League members like Superman (Voiced by Mark Harmon), Batman (Voiced by William Baldwin), Wonder-Woman (Voiced by Venessa Marshall), The Flash (Josh Keaton) and Green Latern (Voiced by Nolan North) to help him go back to his world where it seems a gang of criminals who are similar to them but evil are trying to make crime a worse place in the other world.

Co-starring the voices of James Woods, James Patrick Stuart, Gina Torres and Bruce Davidson this is one of the best DC animated movies around. Bruce Timm and company really outshined themselves here with a very original story to the DC animated universe. The action is non-stop, the voice acting is terrific and so is the animation but what is important is that is has a complex storyline that is quite compelling. So far DC animation has been making impressive animated movies from ""Gotham Knight"" to ""Green Latern"", i hope they keep on making more great animated movies.

This Blu-Ray offers a flawless picture quality with surround sound that blows away your ears. The extras are plentiful such as two BD exclusives like the live-action pilots to the Wonder-Woman and Aquaman TV Shows, a documentary, exlusive sneek preview to ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"" and an all new short based on DC's The Spectre.",1268352000,,1490,4.771317829457364

It easily exceeds the comic it was loosely based on as far as quality, and it's almost a lost episode of the great animated series that sadly was killed off by cartoon network.

The Animation style was true to form of the comics, and I preferred it over that used in ""Public Enemies"".

3970453,5,B002R0ELCY,"The Justice League has done it all in the DCAU. Saved the world from alien attacks, saved other worlds in need of help and even saved themselves from the people they have sworn to protect. Now, they face something new. What would you say if you suddenly visited by your arch enemy claming he is from another dimension, and in his world he is a good guy?! Well, in Bruce Timms newest DCAU film, `Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths' Superman, Batman and the other JL members will find out.

The whole `Crisis' Story line has a grand history in the world of DC comics. From the Silver Age all the way to the mid 1980s there was a great deal of confusion around the story arcs of the heroes we have grown to love. DC had a great answer, let's bring all these arcs together, say they are all from different Earths in different dimension and kill as many characters as we can. The `Crisis' story in this film is actually one of the very first that has been re-visited a few times in the past 25 years, and for a 78 minute movie it is also one of the simplest to follow. That is a big plus for fans of the DCAU who might not be knowledgeable on the Crisis Lore. So the JL are visited by a good Lex Luthor who tells them about a world where the super powered men and women just happen to be the bad guys and what is worse, they like to kill. They are pretty much the JL through a broken mirror and Lex has no choice but to bring the good guys from another world to his to win the day.

I have been a fan of the DCAU for a while and so far I have enjoyed all the Warner Premiere films they have given us. Crisis was a fun movie to watch. While the character development was nowhere in sight it was a blast. I think that this film was made more for the comic fan. You know your characters you know the Crisis lore, just sit back and enjoy. What character development they did show in this film was done very well. Martian Manhunter had a great role to play, while he was not part of a great deal of the action. The voice acting was top notch. It was a little discomforting at first to hear Batman with a slightly higher pitch than normal, but the Batman persona was still there and at times he even made me laugh. Mark Harmon was great as Superman and Gina Torres was deliciously evil as Superwoman. Still, by far the best acting came from James Woods. Owlman was a villain that kept everything low pitched and emotionless. That is the kind of villain that becomes very frightening because the mystery leads to extreme unpredictability.

DC fans are gonna love this film, especially with all the surprises that are thrown in. You are going to see a few additional familiar faces and a few new faces that are going to make you love it even more. This one made me very happy because it was taken from a story I wanted to see brought to the DCAU and the next film, is based upon the aftermath of `Death In The Family', another story I wanted to see. Take the time to see this movie, and make sure you see the two disc addition so you are able to see the DC Showcase short of `The Spectre'",1267747200,4,3077,4.159395973154362

Idiotic plot holes.  Why do the ""evil"" JL'ers have to sound like Godfather wanna-bees? Why is the mafia superman incredibly stupid?  Why do nukes frighten them? The list can go on for pages.

The voice-overs were just as bad. This is not what Superman and Bats are supposed to sound like.  Half the voices sounded like an agent from ""The Matrix."" No inflection, no emotion - poorly read. Were the sneers permanently painted on the evil JL'ers faces?

Mark Harmon as superman? Awful. Don't quit NCIS.

Chris Noth as Lex? Pathetic. He should stick to cop shows. Some of the worst monotone voice-over.

I simply loved this movie. It's full of action and the characters they pull in are fantastic! The thing that really made the movie for me is the group of villains the JLA fight during the second battle. DC managed to work-around their Shazam legal issues by bringing in the alt-universe, EVIL Marvel family. Clearly there's Black Adam, Marvel Jr. and the goofy Uncle (forgot his name). LOVED this!!

Owlman was great IMO. James Woods was a cool voice for a nihilistic character (although I kept wanting Batman and Superman to come up with a way to lure him into a box using tiny pieces of candy. LMAO!!! ""ooh, a piece of candy! ooh, a piece of candy!""

The Wonder Woman fights were the best though. Ultraman was a bit lame (but he's lame in the comics too).

I also loved who the President is. I can't remember if Slade was Prez in the Earth 2 comic.

Bruce Timm is the master Engineer of the DC animated universe and has ""done it again"". I found myself cheering for the good guys - That's the kind of movie I like.

Clancy Brown's ""Lex"" has presence, and if they wanted to go away from Clancy, it would be fine as long as they got a voice more distinctive.  Batman's voice was terrible.  I know Kevin Conroy can't be Batman forever, but couldn't you have borrowed the Brave and the Bold Batman voice?  TBATB Batman's voice is decent and passable, but this one was dreadful.

I liked watching the movie, but couldn't help but want a better Lex or Batman voice.  Again, better casting needs to be made for roles such as these two characters.  They did a good job with the other voices, and even Superman was surprising good.",1267315200,3,877,4.619354838709677
3970472,3,B002R0ELCY,"I just finished watching Justice League Crisis on Two earths for the second time. And after the double viewing all i can say this that this is a good movie. Not great, not awful just good. Good action sequences, repetitive story telling and UN even voice acting held this movie back from being truly great.

The Action sequences where great(Especially Wonder Woman Vs. Super Woman) But ultimately this movie could not be great for the same reason most if not all DC comics Movies and yes even comic books fall short. There is no real character development from the main stars and no real sense of danger or emotional connection with the character. Even the Martian Manhuters subplot falls some what short and flat. Its just that you feel like you have seen this before and really nothing new is being offered.

The voice action also had its short comics, precisely in the form of James Woods and William Baldwin. First Woods as Owlman Lacked any of the menace and stoic madness i though that character needed. The character is suppose to be the mirror image of Batman the reverse of a good man, determined to destroy all humanity, but Woods lacked all of those qualities. Baldwin also fell short if delivering the sort of performance a character like Batman deserves. His voice lacked authority. Even when given some prime lines Baldwin was just lifeless and didn't seem to embody the character the way other actors have in the past.

Overall despite some of its short comics is actually entertaining. Its beautifully animated and directed. I hope the next Justice League movie ups the quality as this one has done and that they can fix some of the mistakes made in this one.",1267315200,3,1675,4.709897610921502

James Woods and Gina Torres were great Owlman and Superwoman, I didn't care if they use the original DCAU continuity. Dwayne McDuffie can write some badass stories and is one of the best at it,
But I wish there would have used Tim Daly,Kevin Conroy,Susan Eisenberg,Michael Rosenbaum,Carl Lumby,Clancy Brown,Ron Perlman and Christopher Meloni from Green Lantern: First Flight it would have made the characters sound so much better (IMO)",1267228800,2,498,5.397435897435898
3970475,5,B002R0ELCY,"So first things first, a little history and clarification on this project. This film started life as a script written by Dwayne McDuffie (Justice League/JLU) to bridge the gap between ""Justice League"" and what was initially pitched as a spin-off show but became ""Justice League Unlimited."" When JLU became a continuation of the JL the film was scrapped, but the idea eventually became the episode ""A Better World"" featuring the ""Justice Lords,"" totalitarian versions of the Justice League. The original script titled ""Justice League: Worlds Collide,"" which borrowed ideas from an old Gardner Fox ""Crisis"" storyline that first introduced the ""Crime Syndicate"", and Grant Morrison's ""Earth 2,"" which reintroduced the group into modern day, was shelved but remained a plausible idea for DC's then upcoming series of direct to DVD films. Years later with a few tweaks to make it follow a continuity not connected to the JL/JLU universe, but still great if you were a fan of the show.

With an art style that is reminiscent of ""Wonder Woman,"" ""Crisis on Two Earths,"" (from here on to be referred to simply as ""Crisis"") comes out the corner swinging. The story: a good Lex Luthor from a parallel dimension travels to the Justice League Earth to recruit help to stop the powerful being on his planet that rule with an iron fist. Simple enough, and in some cases could be very predictable. And yet it still feels fresh. Sure there are clichs, like the villains being the heroes and the heroes being the villains, reversed organs and the obligatory slugfests, but that's the stuff we look for in stories like this. What was fresh and new was the take on the Crime Syndicate. Instead of just being morally ambiguous or just dark versions of our heroes, we get villains. Crooks. Killers. VILLAINS! The Crime Syndicate is portrayed as just that, a super powered mob that runs the world, complete with families of criminals under each member. I loved this take on the characters. Seeing some of the B-list or second tier heroes (villains) show up early was a blast too. We get looks at evil versions of Black Lightning, Black Canary, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Gypsy, and Elongated Man just to name a few. But it wouldn't be fair if the villains stole the show so we get some B-listers fighting on the side of the angels on regular Earth too.

The one thing I was disappointed with Morrison's ""Earth 2"" was there wasn't enough action, as in that story the teams had to switch Earths and really didn't fight. That isn't the case here. This film has more fights than all the other DC/Warner Premier films to date. I mean it. It's action packed and crazily done. There were times someone would be hit and their head would drag across the ceiling completely wrecking it. Everyone fights, and not everyone you think would win does. Okay I'm just gonna say it. Batman gets owned. Sorry. I'm a Batman fan. Hardcore! But he actually should be getting owned to a point. In most cases he holds his own but there are two fights in particular where he's just overpowered. And he should be. He may be peak human condition, but he's still ONLY human, and when he's going up against people who can lift cars with one hand, run at the speed of sound, or whatever eventually he's gonna run out of luck, but that won't stop him from getting up, and THAT is a true testament to the man.

As usual the voice talent for the film is phenomenal. Andrea Romano has done it again. William Baldwin does a surprisingly good Batman. Not as perfect as Kevin Conroy, but still rather good. Mark Harmon was pretty good as Superman as well, though sometimes he sounded a little off. Vanessa Marshal voices Wonder Woman, and was apparently up for the role in JL, but they went with a different choice. Chris Noth was a great Luthor. I firmly believe that Clancy Brown is THE voice for Luthor, just as Conroy is THE voice for Batman, however I don't know if he would've worked as Noth's voice has a heroic and noble quality, while Brown's Luthor, I don't think I could ever use the word ""Heroic"" when speaking of his voice. Even when played benevolent, he sounds untrustworthy. But the real runaway voice talent has to be Gina Torres as Superwoman, and James Woods as Owlman. EVIL PERSONIFIED!!!! Woods has all the calculatedness, with none of the attachment. He's just cold and too the point, and quite psycho. Torres is just as bad, except she exudes sensuality and entertainment. She enjoys violence and killing, and you can see it when she fights. She's always smiling as she puts someone through a wall or something. It's great stuff. ""I'm a murdering psychopath. It's part of my charm.""

All and all its DC's best effort since ""Wonder Woman"" and the debated ""Green Lantern: First Flight."" Some liked it (I loved it!), some hated it, but everyone thought WW was great. This is definitely in that same line of work. A co-directorial effort from Sam Liu and Lauren Montgomery both of who have directed a DC film, this film is definitely great fun. Great action, great dialogue, great film.
Extra features include DC's standard look at some of the goings on in the comics world that prompted the film to be made, as well as Bruce Timm's picks of Justice League cartoon episodes, and sneak peeks at other DC animated films including the newest, ""Batman: Under the Red Hood."" On the two disc set the first of DC's Showcase shorts is included. A 12 minute short about DC's avenging spirit, ""The Spectre."" This alone is worth the extra cash for the 2-disc set. If the next one (about Green Arrow) is as good then my complaints about not getting behind the scenes featurettes and making ofs will be a moot point. More animated goodness please.",1267142400,2,5689,4.686
3970476,4,B002R0ELCY,"Two years ago February we were delighted with Justice League: New Frontier and now, Justice League: Crisis of Two Earths continues that tradition (although it should really have been another Crisis of Infinite Earths, it's really about two Earths and their conflicts and resolutions).

Bruce Timm and Lauren Montgomery put together a story that in many ways is not new to the grizzled, baby-boomer JLA fan!  Per a Wiki article (take it or leave it): ""The premise of ""Crisis on Two Earths"" is borrowed from the 1964 Gardner Fox-scripted Justice League of America #29-30 as well as the 1999 Grant Morrison JLA: Earth 2 graphic novel, with a heroic Lex Luthor from an alternate universe coming to the Justice League's universe for help against the Crime Syndicate, but it is not an adaptation of either story.""

Even so, the viewer will be impressed with the mind games and character flaws in our heroes.  Jonn Jonzz will be tempted by a woman whom he falls in love with.  Superman will be beat up by a Superwoman with powers similar to his own.  And we get to see our second-tier heroes in the fray as well:  Aquaman and Firestorm hold their own.

I don't want to go over the plot points too much since these are amply done in other articles and other reviews.  I will say though that the story is essentially about an alternate universe Lex Luthor, who is the last remaining Justicer.  The rest of the heroes have been caught and killed by The Crime Syndicate, who rules the planet with an iron fist.  They run the planet like a business, and even have their bribery budget accounted for, in the millions of dollars.

When Lex arrives, no one trusts him, naturally.  He convinces the JLA to come with him but he does not tell them everything, which is part of the story.  Batman thinks this is a bad idea, that our own Earth has problems of its own and that we should tough it out here.  He's out-voted and they leave him alone at the JLA Satellite, currently under construction.

However, the fight comes to him!  He holds his own against super-powered villains quite nicely.

The fight scenes are awesome (to use an overused word)!  The hero of the piece though really is Batman.  He figures out along with everyone else that The Cowl (Batman's counterpart but a lot darker, if that's possible), wants to destroy Earth Prime and thus wipe out the entire universe of the plague of Mankind.

The Syndicate wants to use this bomb as a blackmail device, but The Cowl wants to detonate it on Earth Prime to thus wipe out all the alternate Earths.  When this is found out, Batman and the other heroes and villains freak and try to stop him.  That's where the crux of the story goes and I thought they played it well without going over the top.

Subplots such as Jonn Jonzz falling for the President's daughter are cute and The Red Arrow attempting to assassinate her keeps the story going.

How the bad guys make more bad guys and grant powers to those criminals who help them as a reward is touched on but not delved into much.  They use these three guys called The Made Men, who actually kick ass on the JLA quite horribly.

If you liked New Frontier, Doomsday, Green Lantern and other DC Comics direct to DVD productions, you will love this.  It is flawed, but it's great entertainment and that's the point, right?

I watched the rental version and so did not have access to the other features on this DVD such as the Spectre release.",1267142400,,3432,4.543973941368078
3970477,4,B002R0ELCY,"I love all of these movies.  In fact the only one they have missed on was the Batman Gotham Knight and that was because I wasn't a fan of the animation at all.

This story parallels some episodes that occurred during the Justice League TV show of which I own them all, so it was easy to skip the extra DVD offerings here.

My one issue with this movie was that I honestly liked the voice acting of Owlman better than William Baldwin's Batman, and you really shouldn't like the bad guy over the good guy in these type of movies.  I am all for using tons of A list voice actors for parts that are interchangeable like Green Lanterns and Flashes because there are so many versions of these characters throughout time, but there has really only been one Batman so stick with Kevin Conroy and if he isn't available go with someone else you've already used (maybe Jeremy Sisto).

I am cool with using different voices for Superman, because the latest actors have all read him fairly closely (Mark Harmon, Tim Daly, etc.)",1267142400,,1014,4.45945945945946
3970478,2,B002R0ELCY,"This movie is quite mediocre, and far below the standard set by other DC animation - Justice League series, Batman movies, Green Lantern.  Voice work was bland and lackluster.  Batman was an idiot most of the time (practically a moron compared to his JLU counterpart).  The plot itself was only OK.  Probably the best that they could do when working with the silliness of Morrison's original comic.  Although the ending and Owlman's nihilism IMHO was actually a pretty good alternative to the ending of Earth-2.

One of the most disappointing things about this movie was the voice acting.  If the directors used the original Justice League voice actors, the movie would have earned two more stars in my book.  They should have at least called Kevin Conroy back!  He has been Batman for so long that this is just embarrassing.  Most of the voices here were rather pathetic and unbelievable.

Overall this movie pales in comparison to any Justice League episode.  Luthor or Batman from JLU could have thought rings around these people.  The writing in JLU was sharper, more thoughtful, and far smarter.  Voice acting was also much more distinctive and impressive, and the characters far brighter.  I actually wanted to learn more about them, buy comic books where they appeared, and read more stories starring them.  With this movie I am at best indifferent.

The only bright thing on the two disks is the ten minute Specter special.  It is quite fresh, has an awesome style, and deserves to be made into its own movie or series.  The ten minutes of ""The Specter"" has far more flavor and emotion than seventy minutes of the movie itself.

So my suggestion would be that you spend your money on the ""Justice League"" or ""Justice League Unlimited"" TV series box set instead of this movie.  There is far more material there, it is better written, better acted, and IMHO also better drawn.",1267056000,,1882,4.8006230529595015
3970479,4,B002R0ELCY,"I know that the DCU animated films are largely streamlined and not terribly complex thematically. We, as fans, want to see big fights, cool characterization, and fun voice talent.

JL: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS is a perfect example of this. But where the JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED cartoons were so successful, that's exactly what is lacking here: time. And obviously a several episode cartoon is going to do more justice (no pun intended) to its characters and to its fans and to its source material than a 70-minute film. But perhaps this is something that they really should have taken more time with, because there is one huge opportunity to make this a more complex and more mature tale. That opportunity is with the premise itself. Plot-wise, it's pretty straight-forward: There is an infinite amount of Earths out there, and one such earth is a mirror image of the DCU's Earth. The good guys are the bad guys and vice versa. A good guy Lex Luthor comes to our Earth asking for assistance from the Justice League with freeing his Earth from the cruel injustices of the Crime Syndicate, where versions of Superman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, et. al. are controlling everything through fear. Naturally, most of the League wants to help.

This is the where the opportunity they missed comes in.

How can the Justice League agree to help just ONE alternate Earth? The injustices and cruelties on our own Earth are insurmountable. Why are they so quick to rush to the aid of another Earth? It just sends a very weird message.

Aside from what could have been, I accept what is, again with a few complaints, and that mostly surrounds Batman and his somewhat callous regard for one of the villains on the other Earth. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but there is a moment that just seems too un-Batman, which is a shame, because there are a number of moments where writer Dwayne McDuffie, one of the show-runners on JL and JLU, really gives Batman his perfect moments. Batman is all about contingencies, and he does have something for everyone, even if they're 100 times stronger than he is.

Yes, some of the voice work is just unusual for the heroes. Why couldn't Kevin Conroy have been Batman instead of William Baldwin? Or Tim Daly (or even George Newbern) as Supes instead of Mark Harmon? Michael Rosenbaum as Flash? Clancy Brown as Luthor other than Mr. Big himself? It's just strange, but I'm not complaining, per se. However, I loved some of the voice casting for the baddies. James Woods as Owlman... Well, that's just perfect. And Gina Torres (who voiced Vixen in JLU) as Superwoman is also awesome.

The real highlights of the Blu-Ray edition are the extras, though, as always with DCU films. The biggest one is the DC Showcase short THE SPECTRE, which is a new presentation for the DCU films, which is a short film based on a specific character that they wouldn't want to do a major feature about... which in the case of THE SPECTRE is really sad because this could have easily been feature-length. The short is created and animated to reflect a Grindhouse Noir effect that's become so popular lately with Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL films and his INGLORUIOUS BASTERDS, and that really helps the atomsphere. I've always felt that a character like The Spectre has been short-changed, and while the short is great, it still sells him short by not giving an incredibly powerful and complex character like Jim Corrigan more screentime. And Gary Cole as Corrigan/The Spectre is great voice casting. I also credit writer Steve Niles, a great horror comic writer, with giving a great representation of The Spectre.",1267056000,,3690,4.794025157232705
3970480,1,B002R0ELCY,"Ouch! This has to be biggest disappointment of the year for me. I love these DC animated features but this one isn't 1/10,000th of what Justice League Series was. God awful dialog, one dimensional characters. Angry superman with no other personality but with big name actor billing. Funny looking constipated Batman, again with big name billing and terrible personality. Flat as can be Flash that nearly had me in tears if you every watched the show version that completely makes you adore that character even if your not originally a Flash fan. Another version of wonder woman that isn't of the quality the show had. J'onn J'onzz was more passable though the romance was completely hammy. No personality, charm, or comradery between these justice league allies. I cared nothing for them, nor of the parallel earth. Even the action sequences were boring compared to past efforts which is saying alot as this is all it has since the dialog and story is so painful. Since Wonder Woman they really hit every feature out of the ballpark, not sure what happened here but I am very concerned now for future efforts. I even liked Frontier more then this. Too much emphasis on new characters designs and new voices each time that don't fit or hold a candle to past efforts especially when this film so closely parallels JL series. The bar was set too high with the Justice League show to recommend this release to anyone over 10 years of age that truly likes grade A animation for adults. I would beg the teams to rethink this experimentation as it gone too far with changing voices for the worse and character designs. Your a victim to your own past efforts and there is no shame to use such great accomplishments of the past.",1267056000,10,1719,4.695364238410596

3970482,4,B002R0ELCY,"The Justice League meets its match in ""Justice League: Crisis in Two Worlds"", the latest animated feature from the creators of ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" and ""Superman Batman: Public Enemies"". In a parallel universe, a group of superpowered villains known as the Crime Syndicate have become so powerful that the governments of the world have allowed them to act freely. With no one left to stop them, a heroic Lex Luther (Chris Noth) enlists the aid of the Justice League to save his world from chaos. Though not the finest of the DCAU library, ""Justice League: Crisis in Two Worlds"" is certainly an action-packed animated adventure that will surely satisfy fans of the comic book genre. The story is pretty straightforward but still interesting. Due to a large number of characters and a short 75-mintue running time, the film lacks much needed character development and emphasis on some minor subplots, but does deliver some very exciting action sequences and fine animation. The voice cast also includes William Baldwin, Gina Torres, Mark Harmon and James Woods.

If you're looking to pick up ""Justice League: Crisis in Two Worlds"", then make sure you purchase the Blu-ray edition. The animated feature is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. Though the picture quality is truly great, the 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track isn't as impressive. The 12-minute animate short ""The Spectre"" is probably the best extra of this release. Other goodies included are the 33-minute featurette ""DCU: The New World"", preview of the upcoming animated feature ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"", previews of previously released DCAU titles, two 2-part episodes of ""Justice League"" (Twilight & A Better World) and the live action television pilots of ""Wonder Woman"" (1975) and ""Mercy Reef"" (2006). Overall, ""Justice League: Crisis in Two Worlds"" scores a ""B"".",1267056000,,1842,5.202020202020202

3970484,4,B002R0ELCY,"I had a tremendous amount of fun watching this last night.  Like most of the people hear I grew up (in th 1970s and early 1980s) reading every comic book I could get my hands on.  The Justice League was always a favorite.  This movie ran along just fine with only a few minor flaws until the then.  I won't spoil the absolute ending, but I found the end of the climactic battle to be extremely greazy, corny and cheezy.  Surely, somebody did not know how to end this battle well.

In short this is another outstanding release by Warner Bros Animation, and they are on one hell of a roll right now.  I just wish the ending had been better.

Also watch for the 11 minute Spectre short.  It is intended as a proof of concept for a full-length Spectre feature, and it is pretty solid.",1267056000,,780,4.2517006802721085
3970485,5,B002R0ELCY,"I too will try and keep this short, though I will probably fail at that goal.  This was possibly my favorite, and at least tied for first among all of the Direct to Video DC Universe animated features so far.  I loved the story, the music, the characters and MOST of the voice acting (I will explain below).  It was a definite ""auto-buy"" for me and I am glad I did (and pre-ordered).

The animation and character design was excellent.  The story and action was very exciting.  This may have had the BEST fighting scenes so far.  It was almost like watching a good kung fu movie in certain scenes (more in the ""flying people"" sub-genre than the ""old-school"" just plain good fighting, but there was a lot of that too!  The moves, both in blows as well as holds and throws, seemed and felt real.  As a martial artist and one who loves good martial arts in movies, this was some of the best I have seen in a American animated movie).

I found the music very moving and would love to have a soundtrack CD of it, Very inspiring.

 I found myself getting so lost in the story that the very few weaknesses got left in the dust after awhile. The voice directing by Andrea Romano was superb as usual.  However, I did find some of the voice acting to be the weakest link in a very strong chain.

The Good: well, James Woods performance as a very evil, dark and twisted Owl Man (Batman's counterpart on the parallel Earth is just outstanding.  He gets the MVP among the voice actors in this one for me. He played it very cold and deadpan and it just worked like a charm.  Creepy and scary.

James Patrick Stuart's performance as The Jester (the parallel's Earth good counterpart to our evil Joker) was another great performance (albeit too short). I found myself really liking and cheering for this character, which was so weird because his evil counterpart (who does not show up in this movie at all) is fun to watch, but not someone I ever CHEER for.  This guy is also nuts, but truly a good man and a hero.

 I really found myself buying Mark Harmon's voice as Superman after a few scenes, whereas at first it bothered me.  He totally worked as Superman. Still miss Tim Daly or George Newbern a bit, but Harmon did just fine.

Now for the main bad:  I really missed Kevin Conroy as Batman.  Unlike many reviewers here, I did not hate Billy Baldwin as the voice of Batman and I also found myself letting go and enjoying his performance, as I did with Mark Harmon. But he was not perfect for the role.  Not like Kevin Conroy is. I do not understand what the motivation was to not use Conroy, except for possibly to make the movie its own thing and not connect it to any other product released so far. I still think no matter who else they cast for other roles (and I still like Tim Daly best as Superman and George Newbern second best), they should keep Conroy for Batman for all their projects. I think he helped define the DCU Animated almost as much as Timm, Romano,Walker, Dini and the other creators of those early Batman Animated series and should be used almost like a trademark.

Anyway, none of the above was enough for me to give the MOVIE itself less than five stars.  It is easily tied for first in my collection and may end up being my favorite over time (time will tell). And all the other voice actors did just fine.

As for the DVD set: I really want to give this set 4 stars for the lack of a commentary (I have missed that on the last few and I think it is a mistake for them not to include those anymore. I hope they bring them back. IT makes the product more re-watchable), as well as a really good featurette about the movie.  Now, the mostly talking heads ""First Look"" at this movie that was on the Green Lantern set last year was okay. BUT IT IS NOT EVEN ON THIS SET!  They don't have any NEW stuff about this movie, they could at least include the 10 minute ""preview"" that they made for it, just as many DVD's include (or at least used to) the trailers for whatever the movie is (this is still done for certain kinds of classic movies, such as golden age classic Hollywood movies and classic kung fu movies).  Having nothing about the making of this great movie on the DVD itself, is a crime to me.  Now, there are some hidden locked features that you can unlock, I think if you collect the virtual cards that they have on their FaceBook page (or maybe they just show it to you there). If those are any good, that would bump it up.

The talking heads featurette about the DC Universe and how it developed as a contiguous, coherent universe and the various epic Crises that have been used to explore that more is... just okay.  It is interesting in parts, and as a comic book geek, I did like hearing some of the creators talking about how they developed some of these projects.  But it does not make up for nothing told about the making of the movie.

And including the Bruce Timm's picks from the Justice League Animated series, ""A Better World"", was fine, but I already have these episodes in the collected set.  I can see how this might be great for those who don't yet have those sets.

And the other First Looks are also okay, but again, I already have all of these on other sets.  Except for the new one BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD. And that was awesome! I am so looking forward to that one!  It looks very scary, dark and more along the lines of some of the darkest Batman stories, such as Frank Miller's Dark Knight stories and the recent DARK KNIGHT movie.

But the thing that really bumps this up to a solid four and half stars for me (along with the excellence of the feature film itself) is the short animated film of DC PRESENTS: THE SPECTRE!  That was so very cool.  This idea of bringing a short subject onto the disc I wholeheartedly applaud. I actually liked it a lot when they did this with the mostly silent (no talking) Catwoman short on THE MYSTERY OF THE BATWOMAN DVD set. And this one is just superb. They truly captured the horror, the dread and yet still the coolness factor of The Spectre.  The mystery was good for a short 13 minute animated movie, the voice acting was great (not directed by Andrea Romano!  I was surprised, but they did a good job on this, nonetheless), the music was excellent and I like how they made some parts of the movie ""scratchy"" to make it look classic and old.  It was just great.

Conclusion: So, I give the set a very solid four and half stars and I always round upward with half stars.  The half star missing is because of the casting of Batman, the lack of commentary and any other special features about the making of the movie featured on the disc.

A must purchase for any DCU Animated fan.  IF you can save some money, and don't care about the talking heads featurette about all the Crises (mostly about IDENTITY CRISIS and INFINITE CRISIS) and the two episodes from the Justice League series, you can easily get by with just the single disc set (if there is one) because the movie itself, The Spectre short and all the First Looks (including the new Batman one) are all on Disc 1).  I am glad I got the two-disc set, because as a pre-order it was only about $13 shipped and well worth it.  But I could easily be happy with just the first disc if I could get it for less than $10. And I did fail to keep it short, as per usual, although I hope I gave the most important stuff in the beginning for those who didn't want to read the entire review.",1267056000,,7421,4.2983465132997845
3970486,4,B002R0ELCY,"Good movie, only thing that bothered me was that Kevin Conroy or THE BATMAN was substituted by William Baldwin. He didn't do too bad but the movie would have been sooooo much better with the real voice of Batman. Must be Arkham 2 that is taking up most of his time at the moment but I don't understand why Bruce Timm who always casts Kevin Conroy as Batman did not do so for this movie. I liked James Woods as Owlman, hell of a villain as usual. Still I liked the movie and am awaiting Batman: Under the Red Hood. Thanks Bruce Timm!",1267056000,,532,4.174757281553398
3970487,5,B002R0ELCY,"What can I say, but....this is the best DCU animated movie to be released so far. Freaking AWESOME!!! This movie is wall to wall action. One super powered fight after the next speeds the pace along, plus it has a kickass story line and great dialogue too. There are some slight changes from the DC graphic novel which inspired this movie, but those changes are welcomed and very logical. There are tons of hidden little gems as well to keep every fanboy entertained and testing their DC Universe knowledge.

Okay, now for the bad stuff. Yeah, some of the voices are different from the original Justice League Unlimited. The most missed will be Kevin Conroy as Batman. But this is really only a minor complaint that you get over easily. But...the one thing that I really didn't like was the DVD extras, namely the total absence of a director's commentary for this movie. There is a half ass ""History of the DC Universe"" which is nothing more than okay, but a full ""making of"" would have been better.

So, should you buy this movie? HELL YEAH!!! If you liked the superhero fights in Superman/Batman Public Enemies, then Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths totally surpasses that. It is a must have.

James Woods is as brilliant as Owlman as Baldwin is inadequate as the Batman and the scenes with the two characters prove my point. The story is well written the pace great.

3970500,5,B002R0ELCY,"I just finished watching the newest of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths. Though this is the 7th movie that they've produced, it is only the 4th film that I have fully enjoyed. The others being Justice League: New Frontier, Batman: Gotham Knight and Wonder Woman. These are the DCU productions that I really have not had any complaints about.

A quick synopsis of the film. On a parallel Earth in an alternate universe, all of the superheroes we know are evil, and all of the super villains we know are good. The only remaining survivor of this Earth's Justice League is Lex Luthor. He travels to what we know as our Earth to enlist the aid of our favorite superheroes. After agreeing to help, they travel back to good Luthor's Earth and begin battling the Crime Syndicate, made up of our heroes evil counterparts. That's all I will say because I know that I hate spoilers so I assume you all do as well.

With voice talents such as William Baldwin and James Woods, voice direction by Andrea Romano (Batman: The Animated Series, The Boondocks), a script by Dwayne McDuffie (Justice League, Justice League Unlimited), produced by Bruce Timm (Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond) and being directed by Sam Liu (Superman Batman: Public Enemies) and Lauren Montgomery (Wonder Woman, Green Lantern: First Flight), this certainly made up for my disappointment in Superman Batman: Public Enemies (I'll explain in a later blog).

None the less, every film that the DCU has produced up to this point is worth seeing. I didn't like all of them but perhaps some of you will, and with the way things are going, their next films may just continue to get better. One can only hope but for now I will continue buying and watching the DC Universe Animated Original Movies!

3970502,5,B002R0ELCY,"Having bought the other six movies and enjoyed them to varying degrees, this latest entry into DC's Direct-to-DVD Library is the strongest entry so far. The plot is very strong, characterization spot-on, and the voice-work is close to perfect.

Now, I say close to perfect, because as you may be able to predict, Billy Baldwin is a weak Batman. His voice just sounds wrong coming out of the Dark Knight. Thankfully, Batman doesn't talk much. And the characterization is so perfect. Superman is leader-ish. Wonder Woman has the right kind of spunk. Martian Manhunter is reserved. Flash is playful. And Hal Jordan just blends into the background. Just like in the comic books!

I'm just ribbing you GL fans.

Like all Crisis stories, this is a visual treat. I love spotting all the alternate versions of characters we know. Evil Elongated Man, Evil Vixen, Evil Black Canary, Evil Jimmy Olsen, and ""Superwoman's Three Made Men."" they make me smile. And the Crime Syndicate is a good set of villains. Owlman and Superwoman steal the show, but Ultraman has his moments. Johnny Quick, too. Power Ring, eh, not much. But, its a great plot, with great pacing for the action, and it's funny! I love it.

I should mention that this is NOT an adaptation of Grant Morrison's ""JLA: Earth-2."" Other than a good Lex Luthor asking the JLA for help, and Owlman and Superwoman being an item, this DVD and that book are nothing alike. It's apples and oranges. Maybe because it's not an adaptation that this DVD is so strong. When you have to adapt from another medium, you have to sacrifice something along the way, to the detriment of the piece. Having this written specifically for a movie dodges the ""Oh, you have to read the Graphic Novel,"" excuse that some of the other DTVs suffered.

EXTRAS on this Bluray are pilots for the Linda Carder - Wonder Woman TV series, and the Aquaman TV pilot, that spun-off from Smallville, this is exclusive to the Bluray edition.

Four episodes of Justice League: A Better World, parts 1&2 (AKA the Justice Lords episodes). And Exclusive to the Bluray: Twilight, parts 1&2 (AKA, when Superman fights Brainiac and Darkseid).

What is the first in a series of animated shorts, DC Showcase Presents - The Spectre, a 10 minute cartoon. It's good to see obscure characters given a spotlight. Nice and simple. Can't complain.

A documentary, DCU: The New World. It looks at the creation of Identity Crisis going into Infinite Crisis. As a person who has read all of what they're trying to describe, I found this Doc to be very ""airy"" - lots of big words, without actually telling me anything. Something about how 9/11 changed everything, BAM - Identity Crisis. Very disappointing. JL: The New Frontier still has the best extras.

And a First Look at DC's next Animated Project - Batman: Under the Red Hood. Which, in my opinion, is looking great.

Plus ""Looks"" into GL: First Flight, Wonder Woman, and S/B: Public Enemies, pad-out the rest of the disk.

A really good feature. Some decent extras. The only thing I miss are the commentary tracks. I found the bluray for the same price as the 2-Disk Edition, so it was a no-brainer which to pick: I get the the Wonder Woman and Aquaman pilots, plus Twilight 1&2 in the bluray.

Presented with a noir-ish tone and featuring the voices of Gary Cole and Alyssa Milano, saying this bonus should be made into its own ongoing show is a serious understatement.

Anyhow, the story was definately action packed and although Manhunter's Romantic Encounter seemed a bit rushed, it was somewhat believable.

This Green Lantern could have been explored a bit more, but again, not a major issue as they use him more to flesh out the backround.  This is the first movie that truly does Wonder Woman justice in action, attitude and fighting skills.  She kicks major butt here.  Martian Manhunter actually is presented well and not someone who has these massive personal and power defiencies.  Heck, you even briefly get to see characters (in villian form) like Halo, Vibe and Gypsy, and they don't make you cringe.  Then there is the Crime Syndicate, great character development in the villians as these are the characters many people wouldn't be familiar with from anything previously done.  Think Justice League without the self sacrificing for humanity.  Instead, total self serving attitutdes, and in the case of Superwoman some s/m subtext thrown in.  All in all, considering what had been done before, I was interested in watching it, but wasn't expecting to be blown away by it.  I was happily proven wrong.  This just made my top best Justice League episode/movie list.  Would I want more character development in an on-going series? Yes. Hoever, for a movie to give you the flavor of what the comics are like this was great!  I would love to see another movie done with this animated style, acting/voices and story.

What I really was looking forward to seeing was the Spectre back-up feature.  If you've no clue who the Spectre is, I'll give you the general synopsis.  Created by Jerry Seigel (1/2 of the Superman creative team) in the 1940's, the Spectre was cop named Jim Corrigan who had been killed by mobsters, and was brought back to Earth as a ghost who seeks vengence for the murdered.  Up until the early 90's, I wasn't a Spectre fan.  That was until the John Ostrander/Tom Mandrake series really delved into the complexities of the character's mission, faith and of being human in general.  From that point on, I've made it a point to see where they've taken the character and have always wondered what it would be like to see in film.  This short proved that this should be an on-going series, probably made for Adult Swim on Cartoon Network as it can be a bit classic horror in nature.  Even better, they decided to give it a slight 70's film noir feel in music style and animated film look.  To answer quick questions by people who know the character.  Does the Spectre kill the ""bad"" guys in this short? Yes.  Does he do it in classic ironic Spectre style?  Yes.  All in all, a perfect first introduction to the character that needs to be continued!

3970522,4,B002R0ELCY,"The Blu-Ray version of this movie has a lot of plusses and very few minuses.  Rather than go into the story at length as others have done, I'll concentrate more on the features of the disc.  Besides, who wants to give the story away, right ?

Suffice to say that the theme is pretty straightforward with Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, and the episode doesn't link up to any other storylines in the DC Universe that I am aware of.  If you are DC Comics aficionado, don't be confused by the title and think it has anything to do with the 1980's ""Crisis On Infinite Earth's"" storyline which attempted to tie up the many different multiverses in the DC universe with different Flashes, Green Lanterns, etc.  This storyline revolves around a single solitary parallel Earth and the superpowered entities residing on it.  The Justice League, with the 'good' Lex Luthor from the parallel Earth, have to cut down to size a crime syndicate run by JL-type superheros (note the 'Goodfellas' accent on Ultraman).

PROS:  The Blu-Ray quality is excellent.  I watched the movie on my 720p plasma HDTV and a brand-new Sony 460 Blu-Ray player.  The picture is sharp border-to-border and the audio quality is excellent.  If you are on the fence for getting a new Blu-Ray player, this disc as well as GREEN LANTERN:  FIRST FLIGHT should convince you to finally spend the money.  The DVDs play fine, but the improvement in audio and video quality - especially if you have a TV larger than 50"" and/or an audio home theater system - is noticeable.  The Blu-Ray is putting out about 3-5x as much data per second in operation as a standard DVD, and you can see and hear the difference.

Finally, the 1975 TV pilot for ""Wonder Woman"" (remember when a 75-minute movie fit into a 90-minute time slot without a ton of commercials?) is included and Lynda Carter looks great in HiDef.  Ditto the never-aired (?) pilot for the ""Aquaman"" spin-off from ""Smallville.""

CONS:  The voice animation is fine, but it is tough getting used to new voices coming out of your favorite characters after you've been used to certain actors and actresses for 8 years on the earlier cartoon series and movies.  I wouldn't have minded a few more time-traveling 2-parters from Justice League Unlimited in the bonus episodes (I guess they don't want to give away the store and give you no reason to purchase them elsewhere, right?).  The storyline in CRISIS is pretty traditional and has no link to either of the two Justice League TV series.

The bonus Justice League episodes are very appropriate for CRISIS.  You get two 2-parters:  ""A Better World"" which features the Justice Lords (a parallel version of the Justice League) and the key incident that led to their creation.  This storyline ties in very well with the Cadmus arc storyline in Justice League Unlimited and if you like alternate-universe storylines, you may like that story more than CRISIS itself.  The other 2-parter is ""Twilight"" which was the final episode(s) of Justice League before it became Justice League Unlimited.  These episodes have relevance to Brainiac's entrance in the Cadmus episodes as well as the re-appearance of Darkseid at the conclusion of JLU.  My only quibble here is that the 4 episodes were not upgraded to HiDef before being put on the Blu-Ray.  Since the originals were not HD quality, any upgrade would never look or sound as good as CRISIS but the drop-off is noticeable.  There's also some minor glitches in the credits at the end although thankfully they don't seem to crop up during the episode itself.  Almost looks like they rushed the inclusion of the standard-def TV series onto the Blu-Ray without looking to upgrade the quality.  Let's hope for some HD remastering in the future.

The Blu-Ray version also includes the `free' digital copy for use on your iPod or PC and which can be burned for a regular DVD copy for your traditional DVD player in the home, car, etc.  Take note of the expiration date (February 2011 for mine) to unlock the digital copy.  And remember that if your PC crashes or you buy a new PC, the digital copy will NOT transfer/unlock on your new system so burn or store a copy elsewhere if you want a copy for posterity.

I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think that while the storyline is OK, it is nothing spectacular.  In fact, I think that a continuation of the ending of JLU with Darkseid's return or some of the other bad guys from Justice League might have made more of an impact (let's hope if or when they bring back Darkseid that Michael Ironside is once again doing the voice).  Conversely, I think that GREEN LANTERN:  FIRST FLIGHT did an outstanding job in re-telling the traditional Hal Jordan-Green Lantern birth while also introducing some new angles and elements to the story to keep it fresh.

All-in-all, CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS is a fine Blu-Ray addition and worth the purchase price.  In the future, however, I'd like to see more of a link-up to the great storylines, episodes, and story arcs created in Justice League and JLU.  Bruce Timm and Dwayne McDuffie did spectacular work in the earlier TV series and it would be a shame and a waste not to rely on them for future DTV releases.  Remember, the first ""Star Trek"" movie was a flop and it wasn't until ""Wrath Of Khan"" reached back to the 1960's TV show that the franchise was resurrected.  Timm and McDuffie should take advantage of the critical acclaim they received for their work on the earlier cartoons and not be afraid to 'reach back.'  And as with PUBLIC ENEMIES, getting the phone numbers for the original voices can't hurt, either.",1266883200,,5604,4.691914022517912
3970523,4,B002R0ELCY,"Title says most of it.  The movie is good, but not epic.  Voice acting was great, loved Owlman (James Woods).  Also Superman (Mark Harmon) did a great job.  What seemed lacking, and perhaps a bit of a personal bias, was not enough Superman, too much Batman.",1266883200,,257,4.521739130434782
3970524,1,B002R0ELCY,"With more and more Blu-Ray titles released with Digital Copies, I was disappointed to find that my  Blu-Ray copy of Justice League : Crisis On Two Earths only allowed for a Windows Media Digital Copy. Not iTunes, not for the Mac. I would give more stars for the quality of the movie itself, but the fact that the Blu-Ray and its Digital Copy factor into the total cost of the Blu-Ray makes me think I might have been at a monetary disadvantage as a Mac user as compared to Windows users. This movie is available for purchase on iTunes and if I wanted to, I would have to pay more for what a Windows user is basically getting with their Blu-Ray. WB does allow Digital Copy downloads through iTunes for other movies, but not this. Why so selective?",1266883200,7,746,4.405797101449275
3970525,5,B002R0ELCY,"Simply, the movie rocks.  On top of that on the blu ray includes 4 episodes of JLU, the live action Lynda Carter Wonder Woman & live action Aquaman pilot, and a Spectre short episode.  Great stuff!  One warning for Mac users, the disc comes with a  digital copy, that is PC only!  Kind of a disappointment.",1266883200,,306,4.392857142857143
3970526,2,B002R0ELCY,"Now, it's no secret the DC original animated movies have been a mixed bag.  ""New Frontier"" was genuinely excellent, ""Superman/Batman"" was very fun and watchable... but unmistakeably a big, dumb, action movie, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern were decent if unremarkable, and Death of Superman and Gotham Knight... well, they were better than Marvel's Ultimate Avengers, anyway. I knew this one wouldn't be on ""New Frontier's"" level, I hoped it would be on the ""Superman/Batman,"" but I suspected it would be on level of ""Green Lantern.""

And it seems I'd set the bar too high.

The art (with the odd exception of Batman's coloration) is crisp and fluid, the voice acting, however, is a mixed bag.  Characters that weren't stunt-casted (like the Flash or Wonder Woman) are the standouts while Mark Harmon's Superman (and oddly Billy Baldwin's Batman) merely sound old.  I'm always in favor of bringing in new voice actors for these characters, but how is it that no one realized in the course of production that Chris Noth (here playing Lex Luthor) could have done a better job as either hero.  The biggest problem, though, is the writing.

Dwayne McDuffie is a talented writer, but he's always had problems with the Justice League's moral code: his Superman more practical at the expense of the character's trademark morality, and while his Superman states that the Justice League doesn't kill, at least three members of the League certainly seem to trying to kill people throughout the course of the film.

As for the plot, it's nothing that hasn't been done before: the Justice League crosses into the evil Anti-Matter Universe to fight their evil twins (none of whom are given a back-story beyond their often-ridiculous mobster accents) and save the alternate world.  Anyone who knows the comics has seen it done many time before (McDuffie himself did it better in Justice League: the Animated Series) and the only thing this version adds is a bomb shaped like a giant Easter egg for Evil Batman (Owlman) to putter with.  The casual fan might get something out of Superman beating up the Evil Superman... but this movie isn't for the casual fan, a fact made more than evident by barrage of needless cameos (although it was cute giving Captain Marvel a Spock beard), while the lead villains are just sort of... there (except Gina Torres, who gets more screen-time then any other villain combined).  The dichotomy between the characters is explored in exactly one scene... and that was by in large the best scene in the movie.  The movie's other great crime, of course, is to repeatedly remind us there are an infinite number of worlds in the Multiverse... and never show us any of them.  I would have killed to see Vampire World or Kamandi World by the end of this... if only because the world I was stuck with seemed so boring.  I honestly went into this wanting to enjoy this, but by the time the credits rolled, I realized I was actually angry at a cartoon for the first time in my life... there's so much potential and it's never even tapped.

In the end, the best version of this story is still Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JLA-Earth-2/dp/1563896311/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JLA: Earth 2</a>&nbsp;, which actually examines the issues and moral implications of the JLA interfering with another world's infrastructure while simultaneously having better action, better characterization, and vastly better art, or if just want a fun cartoon movie about Batman and Superman blowing stuff up, this one delivers much better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Batman-Public-Enemies-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0027FG2CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.",1266883200,2,3839,5.385642737896494
3970527,5,B002R0ELCY,"I haven't had the time to watch JL: Crisis on Two Earths yet, but it includes a 12 minute Spectre short film that was worth the price of the DVD all by itself.  I loved it so much, in fact, that I'm giving it a separate review here.

The Spectre film has a vaguely anime style presented in a grainy reel-to-reel format which gives the Hollywood-based mystery a 70's TV show feel, while mixing in a distinct and unique horror twist. But in this case, it's not the villains who are the horrors--it's the hero.

I would love to see this made into a series, or even a full length movie.",1266883200,,582,4.225225225225225
3970528,4,B002R0ELCY,"Definately a good adaptation of the Crime Syndicate...... a bit off kilter however - a bit of research could've lined things up with the comics better -

I'm guessing this is supposed to take place in the modern DC era... well, for one thing, in the DC Multiverse, 'Earth Prime' doesn't hold together the copies of earth (Earth Prime is the home to the evil Superboy), it's 'New Earth/Earth-0'that serves that function - which is the universe that most of the DC Comics take place....How much effort (ie looking thru 52 or at wikipedia) would it have taken to get that point right?

Anyhow, the story was definately action packed and although Manhunter's Romantic Encounter seemed a bit rushed, it was somewhat believable.

The characters were definately interesting and Owlman was a total psychopath.....would have liked to see more suprise by the characters at meeting versions of themselves that were polar opposites, throwing some mystery in..

Other than that, a great story.",1266883200,,980,5.030864197530864
3970529,5,B002R0ELCY,"The Crime Syndicate has always been a favorite of mine since reading reprints of Fox's original Earth-Three version of JLA #29 (Aug 1964) and for a long time the only thing even close in attitude to them in animated form had been the SuperEnemies in the ""Universe of Evil"" episode of the 1979 ""World's Greatest SuperFriends"".  Morrison's Anti-matter Crime Syndicate of America in 2000 brought a re-imagined Crime Syndicate to a new generation of readers and the 2009 Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode ""Deep Cover for Batman!"" gave us the animated Injustice Syndicate which was again close but not quite there.

This Crime Syndicate captures elements seen in the versions that came before.  The public being against the Crime Syndicate as well as bomb Owlman is building (a variation of a right at the end plot twist) is nearly straight from Fox's 1964 version, the ruthlessness and tough attitude of the SuperEnemies and Injustice Syndicate is there, as is the mob like mentality seen in Morrison's version and expanded in the Syndicate Rules saga.

Unlike the Justice Lords of the JL episode ""A Better World"" this version of the Crime Syndicate like all the other versions does not see themselves as heroes doing what needs to be done for the betterment of all but as criminals taking what they feel they ""deserve"" and not above doing whatever they need to do to make sure they get it.

As long as you go into this with the mindset that this is NOT an an adaptation of any one story (even though the Morrison's version clearly has the largest influence) you should enjoy this.",1266883200,,1582,4.759124087591241

Acting gets a solid ""A"", different for some characters that im used to, but a definite, strong job all around.
Character design and animation is where this one shines for me ""A+++"" the flow of the battle scenes especially, are well written, choreographed and executed, super fun watch.

alot of these animated releases from DC and MARVEL can kinda show the scenes thatve been rushed, on only one viewing, im gonna haveta say i see very little in the way of shortcuts, either they're getting better at quickly adding stuff, or the animation team was allowed enough time. all i know is it looks pretty solid start to finish. the spectre short was alot better than i thought itd be, whomever decided on the overall look and sound needs a steady job cranking these things out. put this cat on a SWAMP THING feature plz.

3970531,5,B002R0ELCY,"DC is on a roll with these straight to DVD animated features. The latest installment of the DC line, Justice League: Crisis of Two Earths, is just as good as the preview made it look. Being an avid fan of Justice League adventures, I've been itching to see more stuff involving all of the Justice League in a collaborative adventure rather than the individual ones.

The plot breakdown goes like this:

The Justice League, in the midst of building its Space Station (circa PRE-Justice League Unlimited era I'm guessing) is visited by Lex Luthor from another dimension, who desperately begs them to help him take out the bad guys back on his world calling themselves the Crime Syndicate, who happen to be the polar opposites of the JLA. What seems like the traditional ""stop the baddies from taking over the world"" plot eventually gets a little deeper as the Crime Syndicate, in their efforts to become nuke proof, uncover an incredibly deadly secret that makes an already formidable team of foes even more lethal.

Personally, I really enjoyed watching this, probably on a higher level the Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. Whole Infinite Earths thing that DC has goin on is pretty interesting to me, despite many missteps the over all plot has had in the past in regards to the comic. Seeing the opposites of our favorite DC heroes and villains is really something to see. Well, if its done well anyway.

Unlike the comics that follow similar plot lines of multiple Earths, this story is pretty easy to follow and straight forward. You didn't have to know anything about the comic history to get into it (but it does help you appreciate the guest appearances a bit more), and that will help broaden the target audience. Also, this is a PG-13 flick, so this isn't the kid friendly Justice Friends we're lookin at here, no sir. Hearing the alternate Earth's Lex call Ultraman an ""arrogant a**"" had me grinning a bit. About time they start getting real with the dialogue.

Speaking of which, the voice acting was pretty good here. Although the iconic voices of Clancy Brown, Kevin Conroy and Tim Daily for Lex, Bats and Sups are absent, the cast for the main characters and even the supporting ones were done well quite well, and the overall chemistry between them keeps you in the movie. Oh, and James woods as Owlman is an interesting thing to behold. It disturbed me, but in a good way. Kudos James.

As you can expect, this movie is packed full of superhero smash em up goodness. Lots of big brawls go down in this movie, usually involving all of the JLA and a majority of their counterparts. The animation is quite good, and a little different from the more smooth, bubbly muscle type style that we're used to seeing from the comics. Its a nice change of pace, and it fit really well.

As far as replayability goes, I think its moderately high. If you are a die hard DC fan or a JLA fan, then you will probably enjoy watching this more than once. I've already watched it twice. Buuuuut if your just checking it out cuz it looks cool, its a 50/50 toss up. I'm willing to put my money on the fact that most will like it if they take it for what its worth.  This isn't the overall best DC movie put out, but its still very good. Good plot, good script, good voice acting, and good villains. A solid 5/5.",1266796800,,3302,4.565878378378378
3970532,5,B002R0ELCY,"This won't be the longest review, but I really enjoyed this.  This is one of the best stories from Warner Animation for DVD to come out for a while.  All the characters on both earths were well done. Don't be afraid to stand up to a corrupt power, ""Evil only wins when good men do nothing"".  How can you not like a superhero movie with a ideas and quotes like that?",1266796800,4,365,4.112676056338028
3970533,1,B002R0ELCY,"I've been a big fan of the Alan Burnett/Paul Dini/Bruce Timm/et. al. animated series since the original Batman: The Animated Series. Justice League of America and Justice League Unlimited were great entries in this enduringly successful partnership that brought the same thoughtful writing, clever art style and great voice talent to the small screen.

This straight-to-DVD production bears the names of Burnett and Timm in the producers list, but aside from that, it has little in common with the TV series. The art style and voice acting are not similar to the JLA TV series, the on-screen action is not as well-executed, and worse, the plot is far less sophisticated than the writing in the TV series.

You see, it's a parallel Earth, with parallel evil criminal versions of the superheroes we've grown to know and love. Kryptonite is blue and Green Arrow wears crimson! Don't worry, I'm not spoiling the plot, it's right on the front cover. And that's about as complicated as it gets. James Woods puts in a memorable performance as Owlman, a disturbingly robotic, nihilistic criminal version of Batman, but that's about the only highlight in this piece.

I don't expect to watch a 90-minute JLA episode that's precisely the same as the original TV series. I *want* new and different; I have no loyalty to comic continuity. I could have forgiven the somewhat weaker voice acting and action plotting in this production, if there was story to make up for it. The problem is, this plot was not new and not different; it was basically a less nuanced treatment of a concept that was handled far more cleverly in the TV series.",1266710400,8,1624,4.855595667870036

3970535,5,B002R0ELCY,"Parallel earths, an evil Justice League, and Batman being badasss... JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS gives the people what they want, and that this flick touts a PG-13 rating is yet one more treat. I've missed the Justice League since the series went off the air, and the solo adventures of Bats and Superman, Wonder Woman and GL are great, but I miss all the interaction.

The plot could've been convoluted, but the clear storytelling makes things easy to follow. It starts with a bare-nekkid Lex Luthor seeking help from the Justice League. Luthor claims to be from an alternate universe, one in which that version of the Justice League calls itself the ""Crime Syndicate,"" and not because someone was trying to be ironic. The Justice League agrees to cross over to put a stop to their crooked doppelgangers, even though everyone's pretty suspicious, especially Superman (because it's still friggin' Luthor) and Batman, who decides to stay behind. I think I'll stop right there with the plot breakdown, other than to mention that, as it falls out, the stakes are much, much higher than mere world domination. The main bad guy spits at world domination.

The pace really moves. The story's good, and it's big in scope. I'm a sucker for mirror universes. But the highlights are the action sequences, thanks to some sharp animation and a pretty good voice cast (although, I miss Kevin Conroy's iconic timbre and I'm still not sure about Mark Harmon as Supes). There are several awesome battle royales, pitting the League against folks who can match and sometimes surpass them in power. Three pick of the pack moments for me: Aquaman actually not being a sissy; Wonder Woman demonstrating crunching warrior skills in her scuffle with Superwoman; and Batman's extended contest of brawn and wits with Owlman. Owl Man, by the way, is about as dangerously unbalanced as they come and in him, Batman finally meets someone who not only can outfight him but is even more detached than he is. James Woods is superb as Owlman. I mentioned earlier that I love that the Dark Knight comes across as a bad mofo here, clearly the underdog in his tussle with Superwoman and then with Owlman, until he applies the underhanded technique of trickeration on them. And - maybe a SPOILER alert here for the rest of this sentence - for someone who doesn't believe in killing, Batman sure has no qualms about offing off two of the more noticeable villains.

It's fun, also, to see how familiar faces are presented in this alternate reality, and can you identify each side character? That's not a Barsoomian; that's an alternate J'onn J'onzz with four arms. On the other side of that coin, I like that they've put the ""real"" Martian Manhunter in his more updated, much cooler threads. But poor Harley Quin...

Other than the absence of Kevin Conroy and perhaps the presence of Mark Harmon, the only other beefs I have - and they're very minor - concern Ultra Man speaking like a two-bit thug. I dunno, maybe I expected more gravitas coming from the most powerful despot on the planet. And I don't know that the unlikely romance which surfaces halfway thru the film doesn't feel like a filler.

Also on this DVD is the first in a series of animated shorts which will hopefully go on to feature the more obscure DC superheroes. DC SHOWCASE, in its debut, presents the Specter. This 12-minute-long short reeks of that film noir vibe, bolstered by a first person narrative and a funky 1970s-type opening score. Set in Los Angeles, police detective Jim Corrigan investigates the murder of a film producer. If you're not familiar with the Specter and his gristly brand of justice, then you're in for a treat and for a great reveal at the end. Even if you're already down with the supernatural, pasty-skinned Spirit of Vengeance, this short is still very well done, with excellent near-anime and sometimes purposely scratchy visuals and outstanding voice work done by Gary Cole and Alyssa Milano, who plays a femme fatale role.

What I've got is the two disc set. Disc 1 has the feature film, the Specter short; an exclusive first look at the next direct-to-DVD film from DCAU, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, and previously released first looks at three other DC Universe Animated Original Movies: GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT; SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, and WONDER WOMAN: THE AMAZON PRINCESS. There are also trailers for HALO LEGENDS and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: THE MOVIE. Disc 2 has: ""DCU: THE NEW WORLD"" - a 26-minute-long segment in which several of DC's creative forces discuss the evolution of the modern-age superhero and the relevance of a shared superhero universe, from when Superman first appeared with Batman & Robin on the same cover in 1940 to ALL-STAR COMICS #3 and the JSA's debut, from CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS to IDENTITY CRISIS and onwards. Also here are two bonus episodes from the JUSTICE LEAGUE television series, the pivotal classic two-parter ""A Better World,"" a parallel Earth story in which Superman finally frags Luthor and what happens after that.",1266710400,80,5043,4.871794871794871

They don't charge you until they ship it, and if the price goes down before ship date, you get the discount refunded to you.

A side note; I wasn't able to access the digital copy online, since the release date isn't till Tuesday.

Now, if you're curious about this specific title, I gave it four out of five stars because though I enjoyed it, I could see how people who didn't know anything about the Crime Syndicate before they saw this might not be able to relate to them.

8378211,5,B002R0ELCY,The story line flowed well and the characters were developed well enough to the point that it added to the content instead of distracted from it. This Movie convinced me to buy more JLA movies.,1528070400,,193,4.542857142857143

8378213,3,B002R0ELCY,"It's okay.  That's about as much as I can give it.  I was looking forward to viewing it...and then I was looking forward to it just ending out of pure boredom.  And that isn't because it not full of slam bam bang superhero vs supervillian action.  That's actually part of the problem.  It mostly went from one over-the-top fight to the next over-the-top fight (that gets old), only rarely slowing long enough to reveal tidbits of its thin plot.  The Blu-ray special features were more interesting and enjoyable than the main feature.  I really miss the substance and nuance of the old DCAU which is often lacking in these newer, ham-fisted DC animated movies--which is odd considering that the DCAU's own co-creator, Bruce Timm, is still the producer.",1525737600,,751,4.8203125
