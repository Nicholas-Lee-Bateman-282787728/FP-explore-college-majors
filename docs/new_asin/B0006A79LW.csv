8040794,3,B0006A79LW,"I bought this VHS tape a number of years ago in a bargain bin at KMart. It has two Ben Turpin shorts on it, ""A Clever Dummy"" from 1917 and ""The Eyes Have It"" from 1928. The total running time is only about 40 minutes.

This tape was produced by a company called Burbank Video. This is a cheap tape in every regard: it was recorded in the LP mode, only two short films are included, and the ""music score"" is from a recording of random piano music that never matches the on-screen action. The films might play better if you turn the sound off, and play a CD of fast, light instrumental music.

The two films are in the public domain. Apparently, in an attempt to ""copyright"" their own verson of these films, Burbank added a bunch of completely needless subtitles on the bottom of the screen! These subtitles are IN ADDITION TO the original silent-film inter-titles. When the actors communicate very effectively in silent-film body language, there are inane subtitles underneath to tell us what they are ""saying"", even though their body language already makes it perfectly clear. Adding new subtitles to a silent film undermines the eloquence of the body language; it's like adding narration to a performance by a mime.

I still gave it three stars because, despite the shortcomings of Burbank Video, the two films are still funny and entertaining. They are, however, devoid of any plot structure, which is typical of Mack Sennett-produced films of this period. They just meander from one comical situation to another, and wrap up with a slapstick chase. That's not necessarily a bad thing; and what matters is that there are still many good gags in both films which are still funny a century later; the humor still comes through despite the aforementioned ill-fitting music and pointless new subtitles.",1387929600,,1800,4.8
8040795,5,B0006A79LW,"When I was a kid, my dad bought super 8 films of old silent classics. They were the most affordable. My mom liked our family home movies. I liked the silent films my dad bought. We had a 12 minutes film starring Ben Turpin, the cross eyed comedian. Now that we live in the DVD age, I have looked and looked for Ben Turpin comedies. His films just weren't preserved like other more famous silent comedians. This tape has two complete shorts starring Ben. They are about the only films you buy. It is worth owning. Ben Turpin is on some compilation videos and DVD's. You have to hunt for them. I wish this tape was on DVD, but I think it is worth to have a glimpse of a great comedian.",1257552000,2,683,4.181818181818182
