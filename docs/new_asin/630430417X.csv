7867866,4,630430417X,"Star Wars all together is excellent and this specific cartoon series is a great way to spend family time together. It also is a way for the new generation to experience the vast Star Wars galaxy. I watched it as a kid and it what got me started on my way to become a great fan! The movie is very interesting becuase it shows those furry ewoks George Lucas created not as primitive life forms to be looked at like animals but as small creatures very much like us in the way they feel, think, and live. It expands on much of what Mr. Lucas created and it is a must for any fan.",1076284800,4,575,4.052631578947368
7867867,5,630430417X,"This is a wonderful video for so many reasons. 1st of all, it's the closest fans can get to the magical cartoon of the mid-80's. Unfortunately, the whole series (both EWOK seasons) are not out on DVD...yet. 2nd of all, it's fun for the whole family. One of the more innocent cartoons, it stresses family & friend bonds while exploring the best planet of the STAR WARS series. Wicket & friends get into more escapades in this conglomeration of 4 original Ewok adventures than the 2 live-action films combined. It harkens many native legends as well as emphasizing the conflict for good & evil. It combines STAR WARS & hints of LORD OF THE RINGS. Also, the Duloks (evil cousins of the Ewoks) are some of the best characters ever developed for the immortal saga.
There is nothing not to like about this video, except that it does not use the original music from the series. The music made for it isn't half bad though. Enjoy it with your kids & let it take you back to 1985 & a sweet age of innocence.",1036800000,6,998,4.429347826086956
7867868,5,630430417X,I love this movie. I literally watch this film 4 or 5 times a day! This is a special spinoff of the cheeky little characters from Return Of The Jedi. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time! I also got a little scared  when the ewoks went into the haunted village.,958521600,7,272,3.9454545454545453
