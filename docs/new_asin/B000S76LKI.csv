This is by far one of my favorite adult animation series. Though the later seasons aren't as strong as the early writing, Early Cuyler still keeps the show very much alive: the main character voiced by the musician, performer, actor and unique ""Unknown Hinson"" (wikipedia him! if you like squidbillies --- you will likely enjoy his tongue in cheek, redneck lifestyle misogynist music - he plays a character as a musician as well).

2883301,1,B000S76LKI,"I watched abuot 3 episodes of this ""show"". It was hard to understand the very southern accents of the overtly racist and biggeted characters. It was as moronic and offensive as it was strange and bad. If this show was about an ""urban"" group of walking talking squids (that's right walking talking squids one squid uses a walker. just too stupid to even comment on) called Squiggers it would've lasted half an episode. For some reason being racist against white people is ""funny"". The evil and mean and terrible dynamic between the dad squid and the son squid is scarry and sad. This show is for all those videogame players who feel anonymous means free to be hatefull and sexist/racist/homophic.

This show has zero reviews on metacritic and rotten tomatoes even after 7 seasons, because it's not worth reviewing.

It's should be baned from TV.

Bought all 4 sets together(well why not,if your gonna do something why not go the whole hog,or in this case,squid ho ho)! This series just creases me up,dont know why it has never been released here...guess they think we won't understand it or the humour but they are wrong!

It's probably going to take a little effort to get past your first impression of this show to get to where you appreciatate it correctly.  Let's be clear: this show is funnier'n hell, but most folks are gonna flip the channel after a look at the animation style or hearing one of Early's hyper mysognistical or racist lines and not take it as sarcastical genius-type humor.

2883323,5,B000S76LKI,"Somehow the novelty of the fact that the Cuyler family is one of the rare, endangered ""North Georgia Mountain Squid"" never ceases to be hilarious as they do stuff, usually involving lots of mayhem and insanity and drunkenness.

Unknown Hinson's voice is a goldmine that makes any and all lines spoken by Early into hilarity waiting to happen, or not.  The accents, the butchered english, the jokes, the sounds, all the sort of things, all done to a poorly animated, poorly drawn visuals that nevertheless are fun to watch because of their grit and filthiness.

Unfortunately for the show, it's one of those ""Adult Swim"" originals that typically will have a fanbase only as large as a hatebase.  As many people would/will hate the show as much as people would love it.

Surprisingly, the creators, in one of the DVD bonus documentaries, take the show idea quite seriously, and detail stories of how hundreds of people put together crappy auditions for the roles, and how they did not want to ""mock"" Southern people or accents, but wanted genuine Southerners in the roles so as to make it sound more natural.

Another feature is an introduction to the character (because he sure as hell ain't real) of Unknown Hinson, created and played by Stuart Daniel Baker, a creation of his he's played on local television in the South, and has released several albums of genuine music for.  You can find his album ""The Future is Unknown"" on Amazon, and see clips from his live performances on Youtube (including a masterfully done cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"").

He's a genuine artist, musician, performer, and actor, and even though he sounds identical and seems similar to Early Cuyler, he's completely different and a delight to see in this feature on the DVD, from behaving like a diva for the show's production, berating Dana Snyder for using a ""girly"" voice when voicing Granny, and chasing people around with a gun.  It's all great.

Ultimately, though, the show is about crazed dialogue, overt offensive humor, and seemingly ""random"" things (such as aliens who befriend the Cuyler, and shout ""Death to America!"" at random moments, which no one seems to notice).

This is a show that is immensely quotable.  So I leave you with quotes:

""Granny: When I was little, we didn't have fancy ketchup. We just had ketchup. We used to make it out in the back out of possum tails. Only we just called it blood.""

""Dan Halen: And what about your work ethic?
Earlie Cuyler: I don't think ethnics do no work, I mean that's they problem really. If you ain't like me go hang from a damn tree.
Dan Halen: Overt racial prejudice. Impressive.""

""Early Cuyler: She was my dream, my muse. A vision suitable for the wide-screen format. I can still taste her fist against my face. The sweet sugary sweat from a lifetime of diabetes. A heartbeat you could hear from six blocks away. One big pump every hour.""

""Dan Halen: Good work, Denny. You've arrested a fish... and your car.
Denny: Mmmhmm. Yep, I done it. Thank you.
Dan Halen: Any reason?
Denny: Suspicion, collusion... That that car goin' use that wide mouth bass goin' turn into a robot. Probably.
Dan Halen: Denny, I highly doubt that. But, if that's how you choose to spend your weekend.
Denny: I reckon I do. I'm the law. Tell 'em I done whittle this down to get that piece of corn out of my teeth that's been buggin me for two weeks.
Dan Halen: Very impressive. Do you see that cloud outside?
[indicating poisonous cloud killing the townspeople]
Denny: Yeah-huh.
Dan Halen: Direct traffic into it.""

""Early Cuyler: Godalmighty, we ask you to bless this feast that lie before us, and please allow these spent lottery tickets with their silvery scratchery seasonings to nourish our bodies as they were unable to do the same to our wallets. Lord, thankya for the untimely frost you sent what claimed our pointless bananer orchards. Oh I was a fool to plan bananers on a mountain, you made sure of that.

Having grown up on the edge of Appalachia (and experiencing more than my share of rednecks and hilljacks), I also love the authentic terms and phrases that lace the Squidbilly dialogue.  A lot of my laughs can be attributed to the recognition of just that!  ""All up in my business,"" ""the TV looky-box,"" etc.

But there's a sharp, satirical mind behind these shows that lampoons more than just redneck culture.  From what I've seen so far, everyone and everything is far game for the SQUIDBILLIES, from corporate exploitation to government incompetence to even NBC's Dateline ""To Catch a Predator"" series.

A few weeks later, I discovered that my mother had been telling the truth. There was a cartoon called Squidbillies. I went onto youtube and viewed a few clips then purchased this dvd. The rest if history! If you are looking for a very unique, odd but unbelievably funny cartoon- then this is the one for you. This was right up my alley. It truly is a guilty pleasure. You just can not stop watching and the theme song is addictive. LOVE IT! My favorite character is granny. Enjoy!",1228608000,3,993,4.287234042553192
2883332,5,B000S76LKI,"This is one of the funniest, if not the funniest, Adult Swim shows. Very crude and offensive humor at its best. Unknown Hinson cant not be beat as the lead character voice. The first episode in not so great, but everything after that is great. This dvd has some great features, especially with Unknown Hinson. The animation is different and just takes some getting use to. The hillbilly humor is great. Adult Swim fans must have! Can't wait for the next season.",1220832000,3,461,4.634146341463414
2883333,5,B000S76LKI,"Squidbillies is of course a funny show.  Aqua Teen's Dave Willis is one of the creators, and freqently does voices.  Anyone addicted to inexplicable Master Shake speak will find similar comedic gold.  And some brutal rape and incest humor.

The thing I don't hear enough, or even at all is that this show is beautiful.  The backgrounds have gorgeous brush strokes, scratches and spots.  The characters have a squiggly ""drawn"" look, and at the same time move remarkably smoothly and are extremely expressive and articulate.  If this show sucked I'd turn the sound off and just look at it.

I feel guilty watching Squidbillies because so much love obviously went into it.  I don't think I have half as much love in my heart as is in this show.",1219190400,10,741,4.682170542635659

This family lacks any modern day form of inhibitions.  Running around scantily clad and often times only wearing a hat.  Through good times and bad the family is continually brought closer together, so that they may once again beat the ever living crap out of one another.

This 2 disk DVD collection is a real keeper.  You won't be disappointed in the mind numbing display of violent, corruption, and extreme overt racism.  Makes a great stocking stuffer and if it don't fit, what were you thinking its a box of DVD's they go in the DVD player not a stocking.

I have watched this DVD collection twice over and continually on adult-swim as often as I can.  Season 3 will start in 2008.  I highly recommend this DVD box set be added to your collection.  If not yours then perhaps the collection of a roommate you owe rent money to as a distraction to the fact that your a lazy bum that spent the last of your money on a DVD box set and are to busy watching one of the best shows ever made to go get a job.

2883358,4,B000S76LKI,"From one of the creative minds behind Adult Swim's smash Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Squidbillies pushes the limits for offensiveness compared to some of the other shows on the Adult Swim lineup, and in some cases, even goes over it.  It's all good however, considering that Squidbillies is mostly pure comic glee.  The show revolves around an ex-con, hillbilly, talking squid named Early, who is re-united with his illegitamite son in backwoods redneck country.  In between the series of mis-adventures that the two embark on, they deal with crack-pot family members, and a sheriff that has his share of problems.  There's plenty of gross out gags and cliche' hillbilly behavior, and for the most part it's all frequently hilarious throughout.  The animation style may not be everyone's cup of tea to be sure, but it suits the environment and the setting.  As said before, Squidbillies is definitely not for everyone, but it keeps on supplying the laughs, and in that department alone, is worth checking out.",1184889600,40,1005,5.024096385542169
