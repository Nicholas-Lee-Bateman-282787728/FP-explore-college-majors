7813184,5,6301627318,"Wonderful movie that should be re-issued in DVD.  Great performances by Glenda Jackson, Mona Washbourne, and Trevor Howard.  It made me buy the collected poems of Stevie Smith.  The movie comes from the stage play about Smith, and is almost entirely in her own words.",1415318400,2,267,4.888888888888889
7813185,5,6301627318,A wonderful film about the life of Stevie Smith the poet with Glenda Jackson as Stevie & Mona Washington as her aunt. A very touching film brilliantly acted by both Glenda Jackson & Mona Washington. I do wish they would release this film on DVD. I would like to buy my friend a copy but she no longer has a VHS player.,1274918400,4,318,4.145161290322581
7813186,5,6301627318,"I just watched this wonderful film last night, making due with the VHS fomat I taped from TV years ago.  How I would love to have it on DVD.  The other reviews have explained its many strengths.  I merely wanted to add another, more current, voice to the plea for it to be released on DVD.  There is an audience out here for it-- really there is!",1236124800,7,346,4.119402985074627
7813187,5,6301627318,"This movie was one of my formative movies.

It NEEDS to be available to the current crop of humans.  They need to have alternate images of a 'hero' in order to get a well-distributed variety of individuals.

I agree, it needs to be released on a disc format.

Please, put it out on a High-Def format.  It was a beautiful movie as well as a poignant one.

Might as well do it right if you're going to bother at this point, eh?

And you could put nice links to her poems and such, given the new formats for the HD discs.

I'd prefer Blu-Ray, if given the option.",1201737600,,560,4.12037037037037
7813188,5,6301627318,"There's sooooo much dreck issued on DVD nowadays, day-in and day-out; so much stuff surfeited with car chases, shootings, bombings, chases, meaningless special effects out the ying-yang. All the while there are gems like this movie, out of print even in VHS, waiting to be released, and which probably could be for very little.  This filmization of a stage play makes no apologies for being so, and need make none.  Like all the best filmizations of great drama, it is the drama, the acting, the words, the direction that matter.  This play, about British poet Stevie Smith, is very fine-- but it is the magnificent work of Mona Washbourne, Trevor Howard, and most especially, the great Glenda Jackson, that give this film a weight and vividness and compassion that flashier films, for all their plottng and special effects and gimmicks, often lack.  It preserves one of the truly great performances on film, by one of the greatest of actresses:  Jackson is simply brilliant. I had never been especially fond of Smith's works, and this film fleshed them out and breathed life, soul, and urgency into them.  A true treasure for people who like films with substance, rather than eye-candy. Sometimes very funny, it is also truly, poignantly, moving. The relationship of Stevie and her aunt-- a no-nonsense woman, so different from Stevie herself-- is beautifully drawn.  A great film-- not in spite of its ""staginess"", but quite irrespective of it.  It should be released in a fine DVD format forthwith.",1106611200,31,1501,4.976
7813189,4,6301627318,"The best type of film, one that stays with you and intrudes your thoughts for days and days. Glenda Jackson is as always excellent and Mona Washbourne is a wonderful actor, effortlessly balancing Jackson's genius.
It should be seen over and over to appreciate the beauty of the words of Smith on film",1073260800,6,300,4.679245283018868
