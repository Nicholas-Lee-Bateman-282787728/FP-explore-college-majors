7983796,5,B00008G7BI,"Caution: Do not confuse with the Sci-Fi Channel's series of the same name!

No theatrics here, just sober investigations into several purported hauntings. This is not a ""balanced"" documentary: The emphasis is on evidence in favor of the proposition that these hauntings are real. The film features extensive witness monologues instead of sound bites intercut with special effects and spooky music, as is too often the case in this genre. Some, including at least one reviewer here, may find this approach dull. I found it informative and serious. Usually I find shows like this funny or embarassing.",1139702400,11,599,5.175257731958763
7983797,5,B00008G7BI,"We shot this series back in the UK in 1997 and it was the first of a whole host of ""Paranormal"" programmes on TV.  It came long before ""Most Haunted"" and the like, and was the Discovery Channel's biggest programme in the UK with over 4 million viewers.

All the stories were so well researched, I believe it is still one of the most honest ghost documentary series ever produced.

My main appearance was in The Phantom Schoolmaster (Disc 1), and that one episode took almost 4 days to shoot which is something not heard of nowadays!  The research was real and the stories came from reliable witnesses.

But I could be biased!  Have a look for yourself.  If you don't like it then you can sell it on an auction site!

After all, there must be something in it.  Discovery are still re-running it in the UK after 8 years!

Cheers!
