8411013,5,B003ZUTTD6,"I personally like her yoga. You start all the practises with Sun Salutation. She repeats the sun salutation several times and she is quite fast. Sometimes I can go on so I just stay in Downward facing dog or in the child position until she is done. Then they are standing positions or back bend positions (depends on the DVD you choose) and then some exercices to strenghten the core. As I practise yoga since two years, I know the positions so I know how be careful with the knees and so on because she doesn't say anything about that.",1410652800,,536,4.37
8411014,2,B003ZUTTD6,"I tried the 30 minute vinyasa practice. I have practiced both Ashtanga and Hatha quite a lot and was hoping this would be an ashtanga-type practice. It started out well with the sun salutations, besides this lady's voice. I'm sorry, but it's like doing yoga narrated by Ben Stein. Very monotone and not at all soothing or relaxing. And she kept reminding me during every downward dog for 30 minutes to relax my teeth and tongue. Are people's tongues really that tense? Is this the tongue relaxing series? Distracting.

I also was annoyed that she threw in a couple pretty intermediate/advanced balancing poses without giving you any warning to set up the pose, and there was only time enough to get into and hold the balance for about 2 breaths and no time to recover. Quite jarring. And the ""core"" exercises at the end were just a few leg raises that did not really work my core much at all. I found the practice to be pretty unsatisfying. Will be storing this DVD away for a while.",1370649600,4,983,4.553672316384181
8411015,1,B003ZUTTD6,"I ended up receiving the wrong item. All 3 of the Nicki Doane DVD's have similar titles.
Maya Yoga: Vinyasa Fusion - Standing Flow
Maya Yoga: Vinyasa Fusion - Bending Back Flow
Maya Yoga: Vinyasa Fusion - Core Strength Flow Series
I ordered all 3 of these. However, I received 2 of the Standing Flow Series.
I found out what went wrong, they had the Core Strength Flow Series SKU sticker on one of the Standing Flow Series DVD's.
So the sticker was right, but it was the wrong DVD.
I got 2 of the Standing Flow series.
So beware, you might not get the correct DVD if you order one of these.
I talked with customer service & told them what had happened & they did ship me out a replacement. But I was worried I would get the same wrong DVD again. I was worried they were all mismarked. But luckily, I did get the Core Strength Flow Series this time.",1325030400,,848,4.208588957055214
8411016,4,B003ZUTTD6,"I really like Nicki Doane's intro to Ashtanga Yoga so I thought I'd try her Maya Yoga. It's a really great work out and flows well, but some of the positions are very difficult and she doesn't explain how to get into the positions very well. I would recommend this for people who are experienced at practicing yoga.",1262563200,8,315,4.448275862068965
