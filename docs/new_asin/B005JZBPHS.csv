4713453,5,B005JZBPHS,"I love watching these DVD's. It makes you feel better about who you are. It would be great to see more of these types of programs on TV.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-L-Word-Complete-Series-Pack/dp/B002JIOOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The L Word: Complete Series Pack</a>",1258761600,2,315,7.777777777777778
4713454,5,B005JZBPHS,"The L Word series is about the lives, loves and friendships of a group of lesbians living in Los Angeles. The casting is superb:  Jennifer Beals  (Bette), Erin Daniels (Dana), Leisha Hailey  (Alice),  Laurel Holloman  (Tina),  Mia Kirshner  (Jenny Schecter),  Katherine Moennig  (Shane),  Pam Grier  (Kit),  Rachel Shelley (Helena)  and Daniela Sea  (Max),  only to name a few.  In addition, there are guest appearances by Cybill Shepherd, Gloria Steinem, Ossie Davis, Billie Jean King and Snoop Dog.  Every element in the series is first class: the photography, scenery, costumes and story lines.  The music is among the best I've heard in any series.  I never realized there were so many talented women artists. Plus there are performances by many well known artists, including Heart.
The series deals with a number of serious gay issues:  coming out, gay adoption & parenting, coming out to parents, gays in the military and trangendering from female to male.  Plus it puts a lesbian perspective on issues common to us all:  love, relationships, monogamy, promiscuity, breast cancer and job discrimination. It includes women from all age groups: from their early twenties to their mid-fifties. I was pretty naive about transgenders and was quite touched by Max's struggles as she/he goes through the transition process.  Dana's struggle with breast cancer is absolutely heart wrenching.  When Phyllis (Cybill Shepherd) comes out as a lesbian after twenty years of marriage the story is both touching and hilarious. There is a lighter side: The Gay Pride Parade,  The Lesbian, Gay Bisexual, Transgender festivities at the 11th Annual Women's Event in New York and when the gang goes on an Olivia Cruise it made me want to immediately jump on the boat and ride away into lesbian heaven.
The show does not portray your typical butch-femme stereotypes.  Instead you have gorgeous lesbians dressed in exquisite clothes.  The lingerie only adds to the sexiness.  The love scenes are not just hot, they are sizzling.  Most lesbian love scenes are done by straight women and appear  fake and sometimes look downright painful.  Not here!  The kissing, touching and simulated sex are absolute erotic.  Shane, who is known for her promiscuity, steams up the screen with her seduction of an array of women.
The only disappointment is the ending of the series.  It leaves more questions than answers.  Who really killed Jenny Schecter?  It could be that way because they are leaving the series open to a sequel.
The cost of the series may seem expensive, but consider that you are getting a total of 81 episodes.  Plus each season includes a number of bonus features.  This is a series you will watch over and over and is well worth the money.",1256860800,34,2733,5.00445434298441

Loved all the design and artwork in every parts. It's like having pink photo cover expect it's more like having complete series in a nice half hologram dress cover and inside all discs that appears in each seasons instead.

4713478,5,B005JZBPHS,"It's embarrassing to say that I missed this show while it was being produced and bought it five years after it went off the air.  This is one where you want to find six people and ""discuss"" motives and reasons and outfits after each episode.  If you haven't seen it - and you can get past the fact that it's Jennifer Beals (she makes 40+ look so easy) in designer clothes (even lipstick lesbians probably were a little taken aback), then you will enjoy this show.  My thanks to Little Chicken Productions for creating this show and taking on such interesting topics.  I don't know anyone that would have been 100% represented  by any of these characters or their story lines, but I bet there was 20% in each episode that strongly resonated for every gay woman out there. I will take 20% over the zero I get from Cops/""Real Life ANYTHING""/Zombie Shows.  Sad that it is over - but at least I have the DVD's and YouTube can't do anything with these!",1431561600,,946,4.4393063583815024

4713484,5,B005JZBPHS,"Alice. Tina. Bette. Shane. Jenny. Carmen. Helena. Kit. What more is there to say? This show is ICONIC. The first and, unfortunately, only of its kind. I love that this shows the intricacies of lesbian relationships and how they're both similar and different than heterosexual ones. As someone who discovered this their first year in college, I think it's so important to have this kind of show around and we definitely need another. However, be warned, this show is definitely for a more mature audience, as The L Word does not shy away from sex.

As far as the complete series, I love that everything is in one place. Makes it less likely I'll lose a season. Everything is clearly labeled and easy to grab. The ""bonus"" features aren't plentiful, but I'll take what I can get!",1424217600,,776,4.664233576642336

However, the product itself is only worth 1 star for me, just on the box set itself. I absolutely love the show but I really wish the studio would have put more into this box set or maybe it's just me. I feel as if they just threw something in together within 10 minutes and just started mass producing them. Anyways, I bought this box set because it was way cheaper than buying each individual seasons. I ended up throwing the box away and putting each seasons in a DVD case and created my own artwork for them, it was easy and it looks a lot nicer than the box set itself",1419033600,2,674,4.037313432835821

Although laws have been impressionable since the development, I think this show was pathetic. The characters where fake, and cheap. Not to mention that the producer seemed like a male 'horn-dog' with no consideration to the reality of emotion in being homosexual female. It was insulting to watch. I would never buy the CD. Cheap for Showtime.",1392681600,,455,4.772151898734177
4713535,4,B005JZBPHS,"I was so happy to get this set on the gold box deals during Christmas. It was cheaper than the Groupon deal I missed. This is a great show and has so many interesting characters that I had so much fun meeting all over again.

Several of the discs stuck in the case and were very difficult to get out. It's like they were glued in. I was afraid some of them might actually break because it they were so hard to get out. Some of the discs had to be cleaned before they would even play. That was disappointing.

The special features are probably the worst I've even seen. I feel like they just put them on to say that they had special features. There is a silly puppet show that gets boring after about two minutes and a few very short clips of PSAs that I didn't find very interesting. I was hoping there would be a blooper reel or more interviews with the cast. The most interesting feature is about Dana leaving the show. The ""reunion"" special wasn't very good. I found the host annoying and they didn't discuss much. It was sad that Mia Kirshner did not take part in it. It was nice to see the ladies back together but it seemed like creator, Ilene Chaiken, kind of took over -- without giving much insight.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase but I'm taking one start off for quality of the discs and the lack of special features for an entire season.",1391126400,,1353,4.256809338521401

4713548,2,B005JZBPHS,"I purchased this series for light entertainment, never having seen it or researching it.  The relationships are really fluid and fun to follow, but I must say I was very disappointed at the anti-Catholic/Christian themes.  Of course, you can expect a pro-lesbian theme, but this series crossed the line horribly.  One episode depicted Jesus having sex under the guise ""art"".  Honestly, this ruined my opinion of this series for me.  Also, not hidden is the anti-Bush (George W.) and anti-Republican insults throughout.  I did not think this added anything to what I had hoped was light entertainment.  Just my humble opinion.",1388275200,,625,5.128712871287129

4713550,4,B005JZBPHS,"Great series.  The only thing I did not like was the packaging.  The booklet is made of cardboard and you have to be careful not to scratch the disks taking them in/out of the sleeves.  Also, if you drop the book it is really easy for all the disks to come flying out.  Had that happen once.  Lightly scratched a few disks when it happened.  Knocking a star off for that.

and find solutions.  I feel like the characters depict real relationships
In society. I particularly enjoy watching each character ""come out""
or help others to do so. It helps people who are gay to know that is okay.
I just wish we had a place like The Planet, where we could meet other
lesbians and share our trials and tribulations together.
I learned that finding your true self can be done best through exploration.
I relate to each character in some way, which I'm sure we all do.
I've learned that being in a monogamous lesbian relationship, relationship can
be very difficult at times but so can being in a straight one.  If you follow
your heart, be true to yourself, everything else will fall into place.

a replacement.  Thanks for reading.",1361491200,2,900,4.54320987654321

I would recommend this series to anyone whom I felt would like to see it.
I loved Bette and Tina and wanted them to get it together and not fluctuate all the time.
I was disappointed in Kit because clearly she was so straight it wasn't funny but the writer wanted us to think that she wanted to dabble in the other side...didn't come across too well so it was annoying me.

4713640,5,B005JZBPHS,"Ok, I watched this show from beginning to end on Showtime, I awaited the show after an interview with Guin Turner speaking about an idea for a lesbian show in the works and after the show was over I bought the dvds and watched them again.
  Its a show about a group of friends in West Hollywood.  Most of them are gay but some are bisexual and straight.  You have your 2 domestic lesbians Bette and Tina, you have your player Shane, busybody Alice, gay athlete Dana, temptress who likes to woo with words (amongst other things), Jenny, who's a self centered head case who thinks her coming to the realization that she's gay is the most important thing on earth, Tim (straight guy trying to make a life with his girlfriend) and Kit, the troubled alcoholic.  Later on a number of other characters come into it Lisa (male who thinks he's a lesbian), Max (transgendered), Carmen (hot dj with a heart of gold), Papi (female embodiment on Don Juan), Sasha -or was it tasha-(soldier trying to avoid a dishonorable discharge because of being gay, Jodi (deaf artist who doesn't care for monogamy), Tom (gay interpreter for Jodi), Helena (millionaires) and Paige (sweet, openminded single mom).  Oh, there are more.  The first set of course being the beginning characters.
  One thing to know about these women- during at least one occasion in most of their lives they get exactly who they want and then as soon as they get them they decide they want someone else.  It gets aggravating.  These women just love to kick themselves in the butt.  Most of them seem to have everything in the world going for them but to keep the show going they ruin everything they work for.
  Some of the women are rich, some aren't rich and some are downright struggling for money but they all wear designer clothes.  There are a lot of things about this show that are so far from real life that its ridiculous BUT I love this show.  It keeps me entertained from beginning to end.  These peoples lives get so crazy that it never gets dull.  You basically over a series of 6 years watch most of their lives fall apart.  Its showtime so of course its really sexed up. It has  tons of gay and gay loved groups come through the show like Goddess and She, Betty, Peaches, Sleater Kinney and more.  The music on the shows basically consisted of similar groups though there is also some hip hop.  Snoop Dog was on it for a while as a recurring guest star.
  The show can be a big predictable but this is my 3rd time going through the series and I still love it.  Season 1-4 were my favorites. After that the characters become more and more unlikeable.  By the time season 5 starts to unfold Its like looking at the pile of unfortunates that have gotten jilted and trampled going through the web of the group of central characters insanity.  By the time Paige left the show I really didn't care so much what happened to Shane, I didn't care what happened with Jenny earlier on than that, Bette and Tina didn't have anyone to blame but themselves for their problems but they didn't seem to see it that way and Max like Bette and Tina blamed others for his own mistakes BUT I love the show.  If you don't watch it all six seasons and stop at 4 you never discover what the show is ultimately leading to.
  I give the show 5 stars because after watching it in 3 rounds Id be a liar if I didn't.",1347580800,,3353,4.413680781758957

4713648,5,B005JZBPHS,This product is authentic and complete. All the seasons of L Word in a convenient and sturdy case. Packaging was durable and the set arrived unharmed and ready to be given as a gift.,1329350400,7,182,4.382352941176471
4713649,5,B005JZBPHS,"Exactly what I wanted and paid for at a decent price. Every disk worked perfect, love the casing for the series. Excellent delivery time and packaging.",1328400000,15,151,4.846153846153846
4713650,5,B005JZBPHS,"I love The l Word, but then again who doesn't!? I was amazed I could get the entire series for under $100. Ordered on Friday, received on Monday....doesn't get any better than that! I like the way the disk are held (Book like) but wish there was an episode list.",1328054400,3,262,4.26
4713651,2,B005JZBPHS,"My partner and I have been together for many years now and we had never seen or even talked about the L Word--ever. The show has been off the air for a couple of years and had basically left my consciousness altogether, so I was surprised when the COMPLETE SERIES showed up on my doorstep. Since then, I have been subjected to one of the worst shows to ever hit the television screen--gay or straight. The character of Jennifer ""Debbie Oxnard"" Schecter has to be one of the miserable and wholly unappealing ever written. Why Ilene Chaiken felt that America should be introduced to Miss Schecter is beyond my comprehension--the fact that Chaiken admittedly based Schecter on herself is even more confounding. I am not better or worse for being exposed to this character, just out several hours of my life that I can never get back.

Leaving the Schecter character out of it, the L Word continually brought up important and complicated issues only to barely deal with them, and in the most superficial of manners at that. In fact, I kept waiting for Carrie Bradshaw's voice to come in and say, ""and just like that, Kit's abortion/relapse/homicidal thoughts were over."" Wow, great! Glad we tackled those issues! Phew! Give me a break. In the end, the only things that kept me going were Alice's one-liners and Bette's hotness (minus the sometimes ridiculous hair/wardrobe).

All in all, the L Word proved to be a disappointing waste of time and missed opportunity by Ilene Chaiken. Of course, could more truly be expected from the writer of Barb Wire?",1327363200,2,1548,4.772388059701493
4713652,4,B005JZBPHS,My roommate loves this series and she had only watched a few episodes. So I bought it for her and it is all she has been watching. I would say it was a great purchase.,1326758400,4,167,3.8
4713653,4,B005JZBPHS,"This series is completely amazing. Too bad the special features are really dumb. I was excited to watch the cast reunion special thinking at least that might be good. No, it was terrible too. But I didn't buy this for the special features, I bought it because I LOVE the show.",1326499200,11,276,4.431372549019608
4713654,5,B005JZBPHS,"my friends & i are introducing ourselves to this series again...we LOVE IT!! :)  we watch at least 2 to 3 episodes each week.  next week we'll wrap up season 1...quote from our straight friend, "" this is just like sex in the city...just with lesbians!""  :)  yay!  so much fun!",1326412800,4,276,4.333333333333333
4713655,5,B005JZBPHS,"Saw this in the theaters and am usually grossly disappointed in movies with a lesbian plot but this one got it right.  It was enjoyable and light, had some laughs while touching at the same time.  I think if it was American it wouldn't have worked as well.  Of course with all rom-coms, there are the inevitable cliches but show me one that doesn't.  What was nice was the fact that this could have been interchangeable with a straight couple, it wasn't an in your face gay movie so I always recommend it to my straight friends and fellow gays.  Also makes a good in-house date movie ladies (free helpful tip).  Check it out, cute movie, but don't get too attached to Luce, she's mine!! ;p",1325376000,3,689,4.428571428571429

4713658,5,B005JZBPHS,"Don't sterotype anyone that buys this set. It is excellent and no one should be ashamed to watch any of the dvds.

4713669,5,B005JZBPHS,"Since we did not have Showtime for much of the ""L Word"" run and since iTunes fails to offer Season 1 - it has been great fun to watch the series on DVD.  The show has great humor and always very entertaining ... the best part is it shows an overall positive view of the Gay Ladies.  Where is the ""L Word"" movie!?!",1277337600,10,313,3.9523809523809526

4713672,4,B005JZBPHS,I would have gave it 5 stars but I was really disappointed at the quality of the video. 4 one hour episodes on a single layer disc? The compression artifacts are really bad on some parts. It's obvious that the manufacture was not interested in putting out a quality product. It's actually a disgrace to the DVD format.,1273104000,51,318,4.5

4713674,2,B005JZBPHS,"After hearing so many great things about 'The L Word' I went ahead and bought the entire series. While I admit it makes an effort to be relevant and inclusive, I could not get over the shallow treatment of transgendered individuals and bisexuals on the show. I also failed to see the relevance of the death of someone very likeable in the third season. The moment that happened, I lost all faith in the show itself and in Ilene Chaiken. I thought this series was shallow and failed to go underneath the surface. I also found the writing to be tedious and self-indulgent. This could have been so much better. The only relationship I actually liked was the one between Lara and Dana, although Tina and Bette were not bad either. A disappointment all around, but that is just my opinion.",1269734400,6,784,4.567375886524823

I watched the series when it debuted and absolutely loved the show, however now that I am ""older and wiser"" I see how far-fetched the show is. I see it as a lesbian soap opera. All lesbians are not this glamorous, dress well, or look like they have eating disorders.... but I'm not reviewing the series... The DVDs are for collectors who want to keep watching the show even after it has left...",1264982400,,477,4.195652173913044

The day it arrived at the house I opened the package and was pleased to see it was completely sealed in another package so there was no risk of damage. My girlfriend loves it. We have only viewed up to the 3rd series but so far no problems. The great price (almost half price!) was also a bonus! Thank you.,1263168000,2,372,4.253521126760563

There are so many causes and issues brought up in this show and go further than what you would see on any other show or the news and I think that is part of what makes it wonderful..
