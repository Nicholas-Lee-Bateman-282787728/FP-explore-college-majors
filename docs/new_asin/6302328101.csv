452905,5,6302328101,"I remember seeing this on Showtime or HBO a long time ago, and have been talking about it ever since.  The humor of this movie is very dark, but very enjoyable.  Billy Zane has since become one of my favorite actors.  Except for Titanic(I just can't even begin to imagine why anyone would give  up Billy Zane for Leonardo Dicapitated).  The imagery in this movie is  astounding, and the plot compelling.  A definite must see.  Its worth the  $70, but unfortunately I have to wait until the price comes down.  If you  have the money, you won't be dissapointed.",925257600,4,559,4.545454545454546
452914,2,6302328101,"Love Billy Zane and he's his most handsome-est young self here, but the goofy film is not just a B-film, more like a D-minus or E film, or NEAR-film (like NEAR-BEER and near-sex and near-coolaid, etc.) but he's worth looking at if yer a fan o' Billy Z, which I have always been.",1420329600,,278,4.264150943396227

452919,4,6302328101,I enjoyed both Billy Zane and Jennifer Beals performances in this 1991 movie. I also enjoyed the song that JB actually did in this movie.,1400198400,,137,4.52
452920,5,6302328101,"Rented this back in the 90's while I was in college and besides the fun and bizarre story line, it has Jennifer Beals singing a song, ""One in a Million"" that I have NEVER been able to get out of my head! I ended up buying the videotape and watching it over and over, and recording her song onto a CD (back in the early days of creating our own CDs) so I could hear the song constantly. Now that I've FINALLY found this movie on DVD I WILL be watching it again and again, and can share it with my wife!",1397520000,3,501,3.9215686274509802
452921,5,6302328101,"One of my all-time favorite movies. Great, off-beat comedy.  The story is ridiculous. The characters and dialogue are brilliant. The setting is LA. Absolutely perfect casting for such unique and entertaining characters who compliment each other. The film is fast-paced and never drags. One of Billy Zane and Jennifer Beal's best, as well as Darin McGavin's. Very underrated and little known, which only adds to its mystique and excellence.",1382400000,2,439,5.36231884057971
452922,5,6302328101,"Caught this by accident on cable years ago.  Hilarious dark comedy.  Darren McGavin is priceless as the over-the-top street-wise gritty cop ready to retire and sick of it all.  Worth the price alone for Jennifer Beals surprising singing performance on ""One Girl In A Million"" .... a catchy, accordion-driven ditty that should have lived beyond this quirky film. Harry Shearer was great in this too.",1380067200,,398,5.092307692307692
452923,5,6302328101,"I would have loved to have seen this creator of this movie give Jennifer more of an important and sound role.  But of course, I enjoy Jennifer's acting no matter what is done in the movie.",1378857600,,188,4.222222222222222
452924,4,6302328101,"This movie is great.  The cast is good, the acting is good, the story is good.  It is very bizarre but that's what makes it so fun.",1360972800,,131,3.814814814814815
452925,4,6302328101,"Blood and Concrete is a way out comedy with some bad language, though used to add humor. The actors are all very good. Jennifer Beals sings a song & gives a good performance.",1322092800,5,174,4.303030303030303
452926,4,6302328101,"I bought this for someone who didn't have a DVD player. I watched it a few years ago and it was entertaining, in a dark way. Personally, I would try to stay away from building a VHS tape collection...",1240012800,,200,4.153846153846154
452927,4,6302328101,"My favorite Billy Zane movie. Excellent offbeat, off color independent film that made fun of independent films by cramming as many independent film stereotypes and cliches into the movie as possible without being too obvious.  loved the movie.  I still don't understand why this hasn't made it to DVD when every day there are more and more sub par movies make the DVD jump and this one (that so richly deserves it) hasn't made the jump to DVD.
On a side not Don Adams the Nude Bomb (get smart movie) is another movie that should be on DVD but isn't yet.",1211155200,2,553,4.465346534653466
452928,4,6302328101,"I didn't know too much of what to expect when I bought this film.  All I knew was that my Uncle was in it.  His name is Bill Bastiani, he plays Mort a wealthy drug dealer who gets killed in the beginning of the film.  And boy does he have a great scene!  I couldn't stop laughing through his opening segment where he goes on a cursing spree after he stabs Billy Zane!  As a kid I always wanted to see his films but wasn't allowed.  All of his films were R and he usually played a sleazebag.  Anyway the film was very enjoyable.  The beginning stumbles a bit (after my uncles part) but it soon finds it's place.  Billy Zane plays Joey Turks a small time theif, a basic nobody.  Soon after though he finds himself caught up in the middle of a crazy drug scandal.  Zane is great, I'm surprised he didn't get enough good parts after Titanic.  He gives a certain life to Joey Turks, and makes him a likable character.  Mark Pellegrino (Bart)is also very enjoyable as drug dealer Spuntz's gay number 2.  I don't want to give too much away but this is a great film and I encourage everyone to go see it.  However it is not for everyone, and I can understand that.  It's a low budget film, and is very quirky.  I was reminded a lot of Pulp Fiction, however Pulp Fiction is a classic.  If you don't like the film the first time watch it again; it may take a litle while to get into it.  However, I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars for being very original and quirky,strange and surprising, with likable and offbeat characters.  Especially my Uncle, I loved his role in this.  Just watch it!",1176508800,3,1578,4.193333333333333
452929,5,6302328101,"I love this movie. I had been told that Jennifer Beals sang in the movie. I didn't think she was a singer. She was great. I think she was great playing a mixed up druggie who wanted to get straight. The story has some strange twists but it was great. She played oppisite her than ex-lover, in the movie Wishful Thinking.",1126569600,,320,4.262295081967213
452930,5,6302328101,This movie is a classic indie. It has all the elements you would expect from an indie comedy/drama. A must have for any funky film fanatic.,971136000,2,139,4.384615384615385
7824293,5,6302328101,"I first saw this ""film"" on Joe Bob Briggs Drive-In, a show that used to be on The Movie Channel in the 90s, in which Joe Bob featured various indie and B-movies. He showed this movie specifically because it had a lot of drug-use that he found entertaining. When it comes to drug use, Blood and Concrete definitely delivers.

The whole movie has a hazy but strangely alluring psychedelic nightmare mood, but is interspersed with plenty of comic relief (albeit mostly super low brow) and amusing characters - from the ridiculous character Mort, who spends most of the movie floating in a pool, to Joey's low-life but hopelessly cool style, and the predatory, techno-pumping gay henchman Bart. The soundtrack, which contributes significantly to the mood of the film, is surprisingly good and includes a lot of environmental, acid music, as well as old-fashioned singing (Sinatra), as well as Mona's catchy hipster-polka band.

If you're a fan of Billy Zane, this film is a must. And I can assure you that if you ever meet Billy Zane and reference his ""work"" in Blood & Concrete (as one of my friends did), you will get genuine shock / surprise followed by hefty amount of laughter from him.",1525219200,,1187,4.785365853658536

7824298,5,6302328101,"I completely love this movie.  I bought the VHS tape ages ago and held onto it religiously.  Now that it's on DVD I'm acquring one of those.  This is one of my fave Billy Zane movies.  It's quirky, crazy, but lots of fun.",1456876800,,221,4.069767441860465

7824300,5,6302328101,"I recall this film from when it was first released. It features one of the best curse-filled rants near the beginning of the movie that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. It is nineties fare and no awards, but it was a fun movie with plenty of violence, sex, and odd behavior to make nearly anyone feel offended or giddy.",1434931200,,330,4.338709677419355
7824301,5,6302328101,"I can still remember the first time I saw this movie and laughed until I cried!  This film is HILARIOUS, subversive, foul and brilliant.  It's not for the faint of heart (there's lots of cussing, violence and drug humor), but if you're looking for a great indie gem, you've just found your ticket to 100 minutes of pure pleasure. Do NOT miss this film!",1432252800,2,352,4.484375
