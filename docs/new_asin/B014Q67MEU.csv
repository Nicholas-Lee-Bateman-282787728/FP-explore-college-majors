Richard Attenborough's directorial debut is a film version of the tremendously successful West End Musical compilation of World War I songs.  Very high production values, and very strange.  Sadly it's 'only' a DVD, because there is - currently - no Blue Ray version available.",1492646400,,428,4.72972972972973
