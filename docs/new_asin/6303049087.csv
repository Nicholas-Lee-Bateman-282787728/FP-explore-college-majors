8324543,4,6303049087,"If you love the best-selling books, you love this video. There are some great acts including ""The Renegade Whiteman"" Ollie Joe Prater and Marsha Warfield with small clips of the infamous Andrew ""Dice""  Clay. In between acts, there are jokes told by audience members. If you're  into truly tasteless jokes, this video is for you. Caution: There is harsh  language but that's what this is supposed to be.",943833600,4,402,4.882352941176471
