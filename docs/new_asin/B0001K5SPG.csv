Thanks",1127606400,,21,6.0
2009312,2,B0001K5SPG,"The BCI/Eclipse release of Karate Warriors is available at your local Family Dollar Store (for $1.00 +tax).  But buyer beware!  The video and audio transfer on this release is very, very poor: a fuzzy picture and a nearly inaudible soundtrack.

The (all-too familiar) plot traces the mercenary Chiba pitting two rival gangs against one another.  In the process he befriends a young boy whose father is an apt Samurai.  Chiba's and the Samurai's paths eventually collide.

Admittedly, there is some fine karate entertainment here.  Also, Sonny shows a very believably gentle side to his character in his relation to the young boy.  In fact, next to the first two Streetfighter episodes, this is probably my (third) favorite Sonny Chiba film.

Too bad the DVD transfer is so pitiful--bordering on the intolerable, otherwise I would easily have given the film 4 stars.",1122422400,3,865,5.078014184397163
2009313,5,B0001K5SPG,"Sosai Masutatsu Oyama.....the legendary Japanese Karate Master who revolutionized Karate forever........The Japanese Famous Anime Karate Baka Ichidai has been released in Japan for decade. The story of Kyokushin Kaikan and its history. Ever since the Anime has been released in Japan, it has gained such popularity and fame of this Mas Oyama's Karate all over the nation. Today, it is THE most popular, and most practiced Japanese Karate Style in Japan, and world wide. Mas Oyama has passed away back in 1994. This film is based on his life, and character. This complete the trilogy which are both entertaining, and now classic. However, it is NOT a biography film. The Media 8, the Japanese Kyokushin Kaikan film production has produced tons of film about Mas Oyama as well as Every single All Japan, and World Open tournament footage which is only available in Japan. The latest Asian number one hit movie ""Fighter in the Wind"" from Korea is the closest it can get if you would like to see the biography based movie of Mas Oyama. However, it is not 100% accurate for some reason. It plays a little politic and prejudice. After all it is a movie, and has to entertain the audience. The ""Figther in the Wind"" is currently only availabe in Korea, but soon I hopt to hit USA. OSU~!!!",1106265600,4,1281,4.748878923766816
2009314,2,B0001K5SPG,"A KUNG-FU FIGHTER [SONNY CHIBA] BECOMES CAUGHT UP IN A GANG BETWEEN TWO GANGS. THE FIGHT SCENES ARE MOSTLY BORING UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM AND THE STORY IS EXTREMELY WEAK. BUT HOPEFULLY, THINGS TEND TO GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF. AT LEAST THE MOVIE DOES END ON A GOOD NOTE. THIS IS NOT ONE OF SONNY CHIBA'S BEST MOVIES, BUT IF YOU'RE A DIE-HARD MARTIAL ARTS FAN, YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE THIS MOVIE.",1104883200,,411,4.35064935064935
2009325,5,B0001K5SPG,"Domestic violence isn't funny, but the slap at around 36 minutes is. She goes the opposite way he slapped her... I mean, I know this isn't the most recent movie, but they didn't notice that during filming? Gratuitous violence, a samurai, and a karate master - what more does a movie need?",1403395200,,288,4.5576923076923075
2009326,4,B0001K5SPG,This is the third installment of movies about the life of Masutatsu Oyama (played by former student Sonny Chiba) which is loosely based on his exploits. The opening fight scene is worth the price of the dvd alone. Oyama is a drifter who finds himself involved with anything from gangsters to pro wreslers in this one. The wreslers are played by Eddie Sullivan and Rip Tyler. Oyama takes up tag team fighting to make some quick money. He is teamed up with The great Yamashita (played by Hideo Murota) but is disillusioned when he has to throw a fight which goes against his honor. He also befriends a few homeless kids and helps out one of the boys sister who is a hooker. There's also an interesing climax at the end of this movie that can be seen as a salute(not a ripoff)of a famous Bruce Lee film.  It's a good movie and i'm sorry i started the series at the end instead of the beginning. I will be getting the first 2. The dvd looks great and has excellent picture quality. The soundtrack is in japanese with english subtitles. It has liner notes and a few Sonny Chiba movies trailers.,1395100800,3,1089,4.417910447761194
2009327,5,B0001K5SPG,"Have to have all Sonny Chiba films, not all are great and remember it is mostly in 70's so some times a bit cheesy. You cant bet it for the price.",1395100800,,146,3.7419354838709675
2009328,4,B0001K5SPG,"Video and audio quality are what you would expect from a '70s ""classic"" like this. Enjoyed the storyline and the action sequences and would recommend to anyone who is interested in the genre.",1394582400,,191,4.818181818181818
2009329,4,B0001K5SPG,They want a long winded review. Like Sonny Chiba needs that. If you know Chiba or if you're looking for the consumate Ki using hard hitting karate warrior for the ages then Sonny Chiba is your guy.,1392681600,,197,4.351351351351352
2009330,3,B0001K5SPG,"Not the greatest martial arts flick, but still a decent story. Fair amount of martial arts and swordplay, Sonny show his moves, so the fight scenes are not too bad. There are quite a few pretty Asian breasts, too. Although this is a low-budget chop-socky, it is still a fair movie. My favorite fight scene uses both slow-motion filming to show the moves, and regular speed to show the aftermath, and I was hoping that there would be more of that, but there wasn't. It's not a bad time waster, and if you're a Chiba fan, you'll get to see his softer side, which actually was pretty decent acting. I always did like the Asian aesthetics during this period of film- the bad guys were always ugly, the women typically pretty, and the antiheroes/troubled leads/good guys had a code of ethics. I would watch it again on a rainy day. Can't rate in half stars- wish Amazon would fix this, so 3.5 stars rounded down. Not quite good enough to rate 4, and Amazon can take the blame for not having a more accurate rating system.",1392076800,,1016,4.467741935483871
2009331,4,B0001K5SPG,"The movie Karate Warriors was decent by Sonny Chiba. It was not the 75% of a fighting kung fu movie that I expected. It had a nice plot though. One guy complained that it could be bought cheaper in a store. Hea, if so, do like I did. Buy the Prime time from Amazon and get it even cheaper.

Anyway, good plot, the sound and picture were good too. I saw some reviews that complained about this. But otherwise, a movie worth watching anyway.",1373414400,2,439,4.226190476190476
2009332,5,B0001K5SPG,This an excellent film if you're a Sonny Chiba fan. The story is based on Kurasawa's the bodyguard. Its the perfect plot for this type of film.,1372550400,2,143,4.333333333333333
2009333,2,B0001K5SPG,"The Good:
""Karate Warriors"" is an entertaining
martial-arts/gangster movie.
Sonny Chiba is, well, Sonny Chiba,
and that's a good thing.
Some of the fighting is quite good
when you can see it (see The Ugly).
His character is similar in nature
to his ""Streetfighter"" persona,
but with a bit more compassion,
which isn't saying much.

It's another two-rival-gangs
-fighting-for-dominance-when
-the-independent-loner-soldier
-of-fortune-guy(Chiba)-shows-up
to-spoil-all-their-plans-and
-take-the-booty-himself type story.
There are subplots that make it
more interesting, but that's the
basic theme. It's been done many
times; most notably by
Akira Kurosawa (""Yojimbo""),
Sergio Leone (""A Fistful Of Dollars"")
and Walter Hill (""Last Man Standing""),
All much better movies,
classics in my opinion,
and highly recommended.

The Bad:
""The Bodyguard"" is lame.
It has Sonny Chiba as
Sonny Chiba (!?) on a quest
to take out the drug dealers.
There's some weird pseudo-
Christian theme and...
it doesn't matter because
it's lame.

The Ugly:
This DVD version of these two movies
is terrible.
The audio and video quality is poor,
but that pales in comparison to
the cropped image issue.
Much of the image is missing,
having been simply ""cropped""
(horizontally and vertically).
It seems that the film image
was simply zoomed-in until it filled
the standard television screen.
It really that bad.

Example: Two men sitting at table
facing each other in a dramatic moment
-you don't see either man, just table.

Example: Man walking on beach being
followed by boy
-you do not see man or boy,
 just sand and surf.

Example: Hey! that was some great
karate fighting action
-I wish I could have seen it.

Conclusion:
""Karate Warriors"" is alright.
If you liked Sonny Chiba
in the Streetfighter movies,
then you will like this one,
but not this release/version.",1285286400,,1839,5.339100346020762
2009334,5,B0001K5SPG,"I have to say, out of all the sonny chiba collections I have seen so far,this one is the best. This movie bascically is the last sequel to the trilogy of oyama's portrayal. Sonny chiba gives his best performance.

The movie starts off when oyama (sonny chiba)tries to prove to a secondary school that his art, which is contact karate, must be the only art that schools should be studying. Masters or sensei's already know that he is a fearless fighter. He has a rap sheet of hurting people and animals,such as bulls and bears.

He then begins to prove himself by beating the crap out one hundred students. It was funny to see the plan a way to cheat by spreading oil on the dojo floor to beat oyama, but he still overcame them. He then defeated the master and prove himself.

The story actually begins when oyama is bribed sigining a contract to fight in a wrestling match. He later finds out that the fights were fixed where he would have to loose. So he decides to quit. But comes back when he came into conflict with a sick woman that was in desperate need for medical insurance. oyama begged the contracters that they pay him in advance,so he can save the young girl. When the fight begin, the challenger tried to kill oyama. Oyama had no choice but to use karate in order to pertect himself. The contracters was angry and killed the woman that oyama was trying to save. Oyama and his judo sidekick Futysaia went on a massive rampage in a impressive climatic all out karate expo.

The movie itself is incredible. The picture quailty on this disk is great. To see a movie this old in a smooth widescreen presentation is truly remararkable.",1196208000,,1642,4.481605351170568

8013768,4,B0001K5SPG,"Sonny Chiba is a wandering martial arts master who travels to different dojo's to challenge the masters one on one just for prides sake. He then ends up in a wrestling ring fighting for money but in this case,he and a partner are supposed to lose to entertain the foreign crowd. He then befriends a girl who is dying from TB and asks the foreigner's for an advance of money to buy the girl medicine. Here's where it get's stupid. He doesn't throw the match so they kill the girl. What kind of a movie is this?If anything it was like a sophomore 'Killing Machine. I only rated it as excellent is because this movie has some good action in it. Let's face it. Sonny Chiba(of which I own 10 different movies of) put out more lemons than a lemonade stand with no sugar. This one's Okay!!!",1403827200,,783,4.333333333333333
