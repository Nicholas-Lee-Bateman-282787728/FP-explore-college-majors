5967936,5,B00F5VQIZK,Great set of movies! My daughter loves watching Octonauts!,1430784000,,58,5.555555555555555
5967937,3,B00F5VQIZK,Item arrived as expected would order from seller again. Would not recommend the it if you are looking for a book that doesn't fall apart. The pages come apart easily so for a child who loves to flip through over and over this book doesn't hold up to one flip through! Disappointing because we were so eager to get the creature report.,1426032000,,334,4.403225806451613
5967938,5,B00F5VQIZK,"My 3 year old son loves Octonauts! It's very entertaining and educational show. It will teach your child about different sea creatures you didn't even know exist.

This DVD includes 3 great octonauts episodes
1. Humuhumunukuapua'a
2. Narwhal
3. Undersea Storm

At the end of each episode is a creature report in the same way than in the TV shows. This is nice because in some DVD's 'creature reports' have been separated and don't play in the end of each episode.

As Peso would say it, Flappity flippers !",1425254400,,506,4.662921348314606

5967940,3,B00F5VQIZK,"A great group of cartoons that my daughter never seems to tire of. She's three and her cousins thoroughly enjoy it too and they are five and eight. I can't give it any more than three stars though because this indicates that it comes with a puzzle, and it does not. If you're choosing this one over the other DVDs because of the puzzle, skip it because there is no puzzle.",1421107200,,372,4.253521126760563

It came in handy when we lost our TV connection and were able to put this on instead of our Octonaut DVR episode recordings.  Great starter DVD for little Octonaut fans, and as a bonus this version comes with a puzzle!",1416268800,,310,4.237288135593221
