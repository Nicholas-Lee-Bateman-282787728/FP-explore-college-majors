Most people's exposure to Shao Lin kung fu are from the movies and TV shows, maybe some exhibitions on stage. Most of what is demonstrated are more acrobatic and flashy, oftentimes choreographed.  Jin Gang Quan is an actual combat form that Shao Lin monks learn.  It is very different from what we normally associate with 'Shao Lin' and is worth it to get just to see just how 'unflashy' a practical form can look like.

Anyone who actually learns the Jin Gang Quan form knows how tough it can be.  Learning from the DVD? Sure, the instructions are clear, but nothing beats learning live from an instructor.  Having said that, because this form is so different than other kung fu forms, I needed to go back to the DVD frequently to remember and fine tune what I learn in class.  As a reference, I find this DVD invaluable.",1353024000,,902,4.565217391304348
