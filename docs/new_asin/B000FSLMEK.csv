8126183,4,B000FSLMEK,"Great DVD! Would have liked even more recipes. Have been enjoying the recipes I did try!
Chef Kathleen offers great advice on trimming down!",1353542400,,140,4.875
8126184,4,B000FSLMEK,"I enjoyed watching the video `Cooking thin and loving food with chef Kathleen' by Kathleen Daelemans. Daelemans cooks healthful recipes and interviews busy moms and health professionals in this dieter friendly DVD.

I was amazed at her super simple recipe for soup - gather veggies from a supermarket salad bar, combine water and stock (I use bullion cube) in a pot, add the veggies, bring to boil and simmer for 7 minutes. Voila - a vegetable soup!

I am now using her recipe for Tuscan White bean salad as a snack at work. I don't like the taste of plain raw celery, so I never knew how to add celery to my diet. The celery with the red wine vinegar sauce tastes great to me!

Runners like me do not need a reduced calorie diet, but I can benefit from simple recipes that emphasize whole grains and fruits and vegetables. So many chefs recommend recipes that are not healthful, I am glad to find Chef Kathleen.",1252886400,,912,4.481927710843373
8126185,1,B000FSLMEK,"I was so disappointed with the content that I honestly have gone blank on what the dvd offered as I ultimately chose not to spend anymore time wasting energy being disappointed...If my lack of dvd bashing details leaves you unsatisfied, i highly recommend renting it from netflix before forking over your hard earned cash...you'll be glad you did.",1207785600,,347,5.0
8126186,5,B000FSLMEK,"I just loved it :) I really loved the ""message from Kathleen part"" as well as the ""7 day Jumpstart"" sometimes I struggled with motivation and it's nice to have that daily pep talk from someone who's overcome the same struggles and been there herself.

She has alot of cute catch phrases that she uses that seem kinda cheese at first glance but then they stick and you remind yourself just how true they really are. ""Do you want to be a weight-loss success story or and obesity statistic?"" That was one of them and I actually use, that one along with a couple other things she said that just clicked.

I didn't really follow the menue, but did my own healthy diet. But just having someone say a few encouraging words everyday, as if she was talking right at ya, it was great :) I would recommend it hands down :)",1196553600,,811,4.328947368421052
8126187,3,B000FSLMEK,"I am a big fan of Kathleen Daelemans and have all her cookbooks.  They are amazing.  I was very excited to find a video, and I was hoping for a lot of techniques for making healthy, low fat foods.  It was nice, but I would have liked something with more philosophy, instead of a few meal ideas.  Overall, I think I'll stick to her books.",1167782400,4,337,4.138461538461539
8126188,1,B000FSLMEK,"Haphazard 7-day diet plan with pushy presentation (e.g. do this ""because I said so"").  Each day has a two videos.  In the first video the host jabbers on telling you what to do all day.  This is a verbal presentation of exactly what is already provided in writing so I cannot imagine its purpose except the host likes to tell you what to do.  The second daily video is an instructional cooking video in which the host demonstrates that night's dinner.  This is what I was interested in.  And I would have watched the preparation video on mute, but it was only a tiny window in the corner of the screen.  For good instruction, tasty meal plans, a database of recipes with healthy food, and wine pairings without the diet plan or jabbering try Good Cooking: The New Basics + CookDisc DVD by Jill Dupleix.",1167609600,4,802,4.489655172413793
