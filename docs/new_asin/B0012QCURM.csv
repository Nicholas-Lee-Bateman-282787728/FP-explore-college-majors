8247237,4,B0012QCURM,"Although it appears to have been rebranded as ""Before the Storm,"" the literal translation of the film's French name is Bad (or Ill) Wind.

I'll be honest, I ordered this from Europe because Aure Atika stars in it. As it turns out, the entire cast is wonderful.
The plot:
Franck (Jonathan Zacca) is a very underemployed tech temp worker who takes a gig that entails traveling to a coastal town to work on a computer system at a mega-supermarket that has gone on the fritz following a storm. As he starts working for Hopquin (Bernard Le Coq), the unpleasant man who manages the store, he notices some irregularities in the system that lead him to discover embezzlement. Meanwhile, back at his hotel, Franck has an eye for Frdrique (Aure Atika), who runs the place in its off-season. She has little interest in him unless she happens to be bored or the recipient of a gift from Franck.

While this doesn't sound especially enticing, there's something about the way it comes together, with Ill Wind's seamless mingling of romance, humor, danger, desperation, and scheming. The script is solid and the actors know their craft. While the outcome of the romance is not surprising, the outcome of the scheming is not predictable, and remains the strength of Ill Wind. Perhaps I am biased towards liking French film, but I feel that this is a well-spent 92 minutes.

A strong 4 stars.",1445731200,,1375,4.7447698744769875
