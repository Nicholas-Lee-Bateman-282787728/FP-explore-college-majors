3103318,3,B0013D8LB8,"I happen to catch the trailer and was blown away. I had to go out that night and get that movie. I was shocked that  haven't heard of it before, a Game Of Death parody.. the story writes itself. However, the movie was just ""OK"" some funny spots here and there but never quite delivers. Maybe I am spoiled because I was expecting something along the lines of the classic spoof ""fistful of yen"" from the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"". All this movie made me do was appreciate the genius of that great classic comedy.",1215648000,,507,4.3936170212765955
3103319,3,B0013D8LB8,"I'd known about this movie for quite some time.  Various Asian American websites had hyped this movie for more than a year.  I knew the movie played at the Asian American Film Festival but I couldn't catch it at that time.  When the film was released to theaters in mid-2007, I eagerly looked forward to it.

When I finally saw the film, I left feeling slightly disappointed.  While there were some funny bits in the movie (mostly during the auditions), I couldn't help but feel the movie was ""lacking"" something. I think I was expecting a major laugh riot but instead got a movie that subtly pokes at how Hollywood treats Asian American male actors.

I don't regret seeing the movie as I support Asian American films and entertainment as best as I can.  It's worth at least a rental to see if you like the film.  However, as far as I am concerned, the film didn't quite live up to the hype.

EDIT ON 03/24/09

The film has been playing on cable TV recently and I watched it twice in the past few weeks.  You know, without remembering exactly how the film was in the theater, it's not ""as bad as I thought"".  I think the hype and expectations may have skewed some people's view on the film.  I would slightly upgrade the rating this film to 3.5 stars.",1214265600,,1251,4.386956521739131
3103320,5,B0013D8LB8,"Ok first of all, I enjoyed seeing Roger Fan, Dustin Nguyen, Brian Tee, and Sung Kang in a movie ALL together. I just luuuv them!!! This movie was hilarious. It made light of the serious plight of an Asian American male who goes for casting calls in Hollywood. One of my favorite scenes was with Brian Tee playing a Vietnam Vet. I thought it was brilliantly done and after renting it this past weekend from Blockbuster, I'm gonna buy it!!!",1207526400,10,438,4.4875
3103321,1,B0013D8LB8,"The idea for this movie is ripe for parody and should have made for some easy laughs.  Unfortunately, that ain't the case.  The GAME OF DEATH that actually got made (with Hugh O'Brien and Dean Jagger and several really bad Lee doubles) is far funnier than this supposed comedy.  Do yourself a favor and rent that instead.  Or go to YouTube and check out the martial arts auditions there.  Now those are a hoot!",1206403200,2,410,4.486486486486487
3103322,5,B0013D8LB8,"Saw this at a film festival last year.  Thought it was really funny!  Very satirical, with surprisingly good performances by Roger Fan, Sung Kang, and Dustin Nguyen.  MC Hammer is hilarious, too!  Would have been good if they at least had one shot of the real Bruce Lee which would have shown how good Roger Fan actually is in immitating him (even though his character is the one ""replacement candidate"" who claims to be his ""own man"").  Highly recommended.",1206316800,9,457,4.734177215189874
3103343,5,B0013D8LB8,"This is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. Well written, well-paced and hilarious performances. If you like the comedy genre, you will love this! You don't need to be a Bruce Lee fan to appreciate this -  it's definitely on my list of must-see comedies!",1260316800,,272,4.333333333333333
3103344,2,B0013D8LB8,"Done in the style of a 1970s mockumentary, ""Finishing the Game"" is based on the premise that, when Bruce Lee died in 1973 at the age of 32, he left behind twelve minutes of footage for a movie entitled ""The Game of Death.""  Determined to bring Lee's final dream to fruition, a group of dedicated filmmakers set out to find a replacement for the star in the hopes of finishing the project.  ""Finishing the Game"" is a fictionalized account of that search (the actual movie was released in 1978).

Unfortunately, beyond its spot-on `70s fashions and hairstyles, oh-so-groovy soundtrack and overall air of genial good-naturedness, ""Finishing the Game"" offers little of quality for anyone craving a good behind-the-scenes movie parody.  Lacking both polish and finesse, the movie represents a major comedown for director Justin Lee after his stunning triumph with ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" a few years back.  The half-hearted Josh Diamond screenplay scarcely makes an effort at being funny, and the concept itself is simply too thin to be successfully stretched out over even a relatively meager 84-minute-long running time.

Barely flash-in-the-pan cameo appearances by the likes of James Franco, MC Hammer and Ron Jeremy do little to support an otherwise likable cast.  And there isn't even any decent martial arts action to make the movie much fun for fans of the genre being satirized.",1253232000,2,1381,5.111111111111111
3103345,1,B0013D8LB8,"Yes, I want 84 minutes of my life back (the time it took to finish watching this sorry excuse for a movie). This movie is so stupid I'm not even kidding you. Very boring. I wouldn't even recommend this to someone I held contempt for. I feel I have developed a high tolerance over the years when it comes to movie viewing. Meaning, I'll finish watching a movie no matter how bad it is. I must say that tolerance was put to the test here.

A bunch of wanna-be Bruce Lees come to audition as his ""replacement"" in an unfinished movie. About 80% of it is uninteresting interviews of these said wanna-be Lees. The remaining 20% are the actual auditions. This was supposed to be a comedy yet wasn't the least bit funny. Other reviewers state how ""hilarious"" this movie was. I don't think I laughed once throughout.

Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Let my suffering be worth something and keep you from suffering as well. If you like martial arts, comedies, or Bruce Lee don't watch this. Seriously.",1251504000,,1015,4.510869565217392
3103346,3,B0013D8LB8,"Amusing mockumentary. The setup: Bruce Lee recorded 12 minutes of a new movie before dying. The studio wants to hire a double to finish the project. This is a documentary of those auditions, where we meet varying prospective Bruce Lees (some who look like him, some... not so much.)",1250640000,,282,4.775510204081633
3103347,5,B0013D8LB8,"Very funny movie on several levels. Looks at discrimination, which is very real and hurtful, and by laughing at it helps diffuse the hurt. Even the most unlikeable characters become real, and likeable. Finishing the Game is a great watch with a group of friends, and even better the second time. I nearly fell off my chair laughing a few times, but look for the subtleties as well. Goes far deeper than one might think, but is a lot of fun on every level.",1236988800,4,455,4.428571428571429
3103348,5,B0013D8LB8,"I stumbled across this gem on cable tv, halfway through.  Watched ten minutes & thought, if this is as good as it seems to be, just gotta watch this from the beginning.  Think Spinal Tap--but with the plot involving finishing a Bruce Lee movie.
I have now actually bought this film!",1232582400,4,282,4.509803921568627
3103349,4,B0013D8LB8,"Finishing the Game was an Excellent Parody of the Classic Martial Arts movies of the 70's. The script for this Mockumentary was hilarious, and the Casting was brilliant. The storyline involves the casting of a body double who can pass for Bruce Lee, so the film company that holds the remaining small amount of Authentic Bruce Lee footage, can complete and release his last film. Roger Fan as Breeze Loo isn't the typical martial arts hero -  He looks and acts the part Perfectly but doesn't do any of his own stunts at all. Still, One look at his facial expressions would make any opponent think twice. Sung Kang as Cole Kim may be the most likable of the wannabe action stars who's enthusiasm is over the top overwhelming as he issues his intense lines with a smile on his face. Bernardo Pena as Remi Nguyen is the exact opposite as he recites his lines with absolutely no emotion or facial expression. The Audition Scenes for the coveted role are one of this film highlights. Dustin Nguyen and James France are seen in a hilarious send up of American (Buddy)Crime Dramas of the 70's (Think Streets of S.F.) And MC Hammer is fun as a Shrewd entrepreneur making money exploiting the need for Minorities in Hollywood films. Oh Yeah, And I can't leave out the (obviously) caucasian dude who thinks he passes for being asian because his mother was asian. He even crusades for the rights of all exploited asian americans,.... including himself. There is even a familiar sounding Voice (Think Classic Sci-Fi) as one of the Dubbed Voices in a classic Kung Fu clip earlier in the film. I probably should've given this movie a  5 star Rating but it felt too short, perhaps partly due to the way it  ended. It's around 80 minutes or so long and I think a bit of that may have been credits as well. It definitely left me wanting more, BUT the movie time it did have was Excellent. Thumbs Up.",1228608000,2,1882,4.545722713864307
3103350,5,B0013D8LB8,"This movie is fantastic! I love the way Justin Lin, The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, filmed this as a 70's documentary. It was a totally unepxected surprise to see MC Hammer as Roy Thunder. That was so funny and worth the purchase price right there. Hammer should be in more films because he can really act. In fact, one of the funniest lines in Finishing the Game, is when MC Hammer says, ""I'm always on the lookout for the next Pat Morita.""
After Bruce Lee died, several Asian actors tried to make Bruceploitation movies that had such stupid titles as Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave and Re-enter the Dragon. The Hong Kong film industry was in a panic to try to prolouge Bruce Lee's star power as long as they could by hiring look-a-likes and wannabes. Lin wonderfully satirized that with Fists of Fuhrer and he nailed it in the character Breeze Loo.
This film is also a look at how Asian actors were treated for a long time by Hollywood in such roles as delivery boys and servants. The real Bruce Lee did a lot to try to change the way Asians are looked at in film. Ironically because of Lee's achievements, now Hollywood is trying to sell Asians as martial arts stars, which means that few Asians are represented as being real. They are mostly reduced to oriental exoticism to sell tickets. Hollywood has yet to make a movie with Asians actors that really show a good well written story that doesn't exploit.
This movie is a lot of fun. The fact that it doesn't take itself so seriously makes it an enjoyable ride. Its worth a rent or to buy if you want to see an amusing look at how directors and producers attempt to create a film after the star's death.",1221264000,,1667,4.415584415584416

A few mildly good scenes (and I liked the Aussie-Bruce who bails on the production) do not a movie make.  Character arcs do not satisfy and the movie just ends with a thud (with a cameo by Bottoms.)

8249970,5,B0013D8LB8,"Very funny. Another reviewer wrote, ""Even the most unlikeable characters become real, and likeable"". There's a good naturedness here, perhaps it's necessary for a comedy like this. I think I felt kind of sorry for the fictional characters being portrayed. The movie goes in different directions tho. At one point one of the Bruce Lee tryouts stands next to a scruffy, bearded guy (always wearing the white Karate outfit in the film) and says, ""I always try and look good, that's why I always stand next to him"". I'm not up on this genre but I suspect it was an inside joke about the Chuck Norris types present in some of these films. It was funny. Hope I laughed at the right thing.

I Caught this on what must have been free HBO night and missed the very beginning. Didn't completely understand the premise. I thought they were trying out to portray Bruce Lee, the way Will Smith has portrayed Muhammed Ali, etc, or they wanted another star who simply could conjure up the same image as Lee.

There's a sort-of conservative element to this movie (aside from the part where a tryout beats up his hero, the guys he's worshipped onscreen, for moving in on his girlfriend and then she goes back to him - I was Ok with that bit of myth making). Late in the movie the producer or the big boss comes in to see how the casting process is going and hes very dissappointed. . . they've narrowed it down to a prospect who's 7 feet tall, a white guy, and another guy (forget his problem). The producers says, ""Darn it, #!#!#!#, I could go to Chinatown and be back with a guy who looks like Bruce Lee in 10 minutes!"" If he said this at the beginning of the movie it would have been one of the most insensitive to say things ever, by the end of the movie when he says this it seems like he's the only one who makes sense.

I thought it was very funny. Perfect rating.",1304035200,,1854,4.337175792507205
8249971,4,B0013D8LB8,"This is a fictional comical 70's documentary style movie to find the next Bruce Lee. It makes fun of plenty of things from the era. Its a lot like the Office only instead of being in an office, its on a movie set. Its a movie about characters, 10 of them and you really see inside their personalities. The B-Movie star, the nice guy aspiring actor, the Hollywood washout, the white asian, the 20 year old director, the aged casting director, the Indian stuntman with a beard and William Hung (yes). If you're looking for slapstick or Hollywood movie humor, this isn't for you. I couldn't imagine sitting around with friends and laughing my ace off either.
