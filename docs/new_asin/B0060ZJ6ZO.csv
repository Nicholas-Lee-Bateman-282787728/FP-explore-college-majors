8490724,5,B0060ZJ6ZO,"Always fun to see big robots in big action.  lots of plot twists and turns.  did seen a little crunched up at the end, like they were trying to finish it up in the allotted time.  on well better then anything generated in the states as most here think that animation is for kids on saturday morning only",1401580800,,303,4.189655172413793
8490725,3,B0060ZJ6ZO,"Yushiro is a member of the Gowa clan. The Gowa clan is about to start a revolution. They will use a new mech that Yushiro pilots. He is also a Kai. He has the power to summon a god called Gasaraki. The Gowa clan will use these powers to overthrow the government and take control. Yushiro has a secret that he doesn't understand himself, and his brothers aren't talking. He meets a girl named Miharu. Miharu has a strange connection to Yushiro and may hold the key to understanding his purpose.

This anime has a very well written story. It's carefully thought out and has lots of suspense and mystery. A lot of people say that it's very complicated. I don't think so. It's very easy to understand if you pay attention. The downfall of this anime is the terrible character development. Even at the final episode, you feel very distant and know next to nothing about the characters. I'll give the story 5 stars, and the characters 1 star. Unfortunately, it takes solid character development and a solid story to make a great anime. Gasaraki only has 1 of those aspects covered. I can't give it any more than 3 stars. I can't recommend Gasaraki to anyone that wants to see an anime with good characters. If you don't care about that and only need a good story to be happy, then you may enjoy this series. Personally, I was very annoyed and forced myself to finish it b/c I had bought the entire set based on good reviews.

I have tried to be objective and give good information about this series' strengths and weaknesses. There are lots of people that get pissed if you give an anime a bad review. I have only been truthful. The only people that should be angry with what I said are the people that made Gasaraki. I don't want a bunch of hateful comments and not helpful votes for being honest.",1355443200,6,1792,4.443768996960486
8490726,5,B0060ZJ6ZO,The full series dvd collection of gasaraki came to my house with no damage and with haste. The price i paid for it was well worth it. One of the most entertaining series i have seen so far.,1352332800,,189,4.0
8490727,1,B0060ZJ6ZO,"As an American I had a hard time watching this anime all the way through. The story, what little there is of it , basically was the evil Americans needed to be taught a lesson and who better to do this than a 15 yoa(?) Japanese kid who operates a mech. This kid, don't remember the name and don't care, single handedly defeats a covert American invasion of Japan and the Americans beg for peace. The moral and honorable Japanese show mercy on the Americans and don't destroy the US econonmy, of course the US must sell grain to the Japanese, you know kinda like paying tribute.

  There is a Heroine in the story who had operated mechs with the Heroe back in the medieval peroid of Japan and was forced to kill her Brother, but this part of the story was very muddled and seemed rushed ,kinda like the writers decided they needed to add to the plot beside America very bad and Japan very good.
  As an old anime fan I am used to the Japanese hatred of anything American and I have problems with what my Government and other Countries' Governments have done, but it was a waste of my money to buy what I could only describe as a political hit piece which had little story or character development.",1329955200,4,1223,4.433035714285714
8490728,5,B0060ZJ6ZO,"after ignoring the fact teh reviews here are for X and not Gasaraki; move forward and read this; this anime is one of the most compelling mech animes made in teh past several years.  it details the creation of mech in its infancy as mobile units are only just being developed so you see the trail runs with mechs. on top of that the sub story lines involved political intrigue; physiological issues.  all the characters are very well done and i didn't think there was any characater that was a complete hyperbole of some sort; everyone has pros and cons and the build up to the ending was very good. an excellent anime check it out!!!
