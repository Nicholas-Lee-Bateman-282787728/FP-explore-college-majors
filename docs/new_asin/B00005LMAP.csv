7943973,2,B00005LMAP,"I wanted to like this movie; in fact, while watching it I found myself kind of enjoying it.  Only after it was over and I started thinking about it, I realized KILLER INSTINCT is really a disjointed, poorly conceived and performed film.  The identity of the killer is pretty obvious, and talented character actors Corbin Bernsen and Dee Wallace Stone are wasted in poorly written roles.  From the opening scene of the lynching of a maniacal killer, we know that somehow the goings on in the asylum have to be connected.  Since we know someone was watching the lynching from a distance and it was obviously a little girl, we just have to guess which of our female performers is that little girl all grown up.  There's little coherence as to exactly how the killer was ""made"" a killer by the good townspeople, so the tale of revenge falls short in that category.  And we have seen so many movies where a gang of stupid kids go off to a deserted asylum or school or hospital or etc., and get knocked off in unimaginative ways.  KILLER INSTINCT is no exception.  I give it two stars because I did find myself at least wanting to know what was going on; too bad I'm not sure I truly understand what I watched.",1108857600,,1204,4.4409090909090905
7943974,4,B00005LMAP,"I hated this film the first time I saw it.  It was disjointed, with weird stuff going on in town that didn't seem to relate to the kids locked in a house, getting killed one by one.  Yet something about the movie appealed to me, so I watched it again.  Then again.  Finally, it all fit and I realized that this is an interesting tale of revenge.  Worth a watch!!
The movie also has a great soundtrack by Bonehead, who went on to become Familiar 48 and then drop off the planet.  A shame.",1088899200,,487,4.127659574468085
7943975,1,B00005LMAP,"This movie is an insult to intelligent horror fans. Killer instinct is so predictable. I figured out who the killer was in the first 10 minutes of the film. This film also has its share of the horror cliches for example(Phones Dead!,shower scene,everyone who was sex is murdered,characters wander off alone only to be killed one by one when they could have just stayed together and survived.) This film is your typical slasher film and it doesnt add anything new to the genre. Dont buy or rent this because it (...),YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!",1005523200,2,543,4.849462365591398

7943978,4,B00005LMAP,"This film was shot in and around the West Chester, PA area and I was fortunate enough to be a part of the film through my place of employment (Good Fellowship Ambulance of West Chester).  The story involves a group of teenagers who spend the night in an abandoned insane asylum on a dare.  One by one they all wind up dead at the hands of a mysterious killer.  As the film evolves, it intertwines the lives of the kids as well as their parents (who are prominent townspeople with their own disturbing pasts).  Cinematically the film is moderately well done, with some fairly well achieved special effects.  The use of the historic Oakbourne Mansion, lends realism and a dark brooding affect to the site being a former asylum.  In all, a well written and performed story by an up and coming local production company.",998006400,4,815,4.586206896551724
