8419763,5,B004A8ZX50,I loved the this DVD on Zenyatta. It was a wonderful story about a beautiful and talented female horse that won races and people's hearts.,1372550400,,138,4.56
8419764,5,B004A8ZX50,"If you are a Horse Racing Fan, your will want to have this to see again and again.  My only regret is that that they did not include the footage on CBS Sunday Morning the following week when they acknowledged that Zenyatta did not win but was very noble in defeat.  I thought that that follow up on CBS Sunday Morning was the class act I have come to expect from CBS",1297382400,4,366,4.069444444444445
8419765,5,B004A8ZX50,Zentatta is perhaps the greatest Thoroughbred racemare ever to set foot on a racetrack in America. This segment from 60 minutes illustrates Zenyatta's unique personality as well as her prowress on the racetrack. It is a must watch for all fans of racing as well as those interested in the unique relationship man can establish with horses.,1296518400,3,339,4.964912280701754
8419766,2,B004A8ZX50,I was very disappointed and expected a lot more from this video.  It shows only one race for this great horse and more on the trainer and owner than the horse. Plus the DVD runs barely 15 minutes. If you are expecting to see a lot more about this horse and a lot more races showing her at her best this is not the DVD to buy.,1296518400,22,325,3.8507462686567164
8419767,4,B004A8ZX50,"This DVD is excellent as it was prepared to be televised by 60 Minutes.  Having watched the tv presentation I knew it was a ""keeper"" if available on disc.  Upon finding it at Amazon I immediately ordered it and now have it ""on ice"" so to speak.  I will save it for posterity.  My only complaint is that the package it came in was not the one depicted at Amazon.  Instead of the cover showing Zenyatta (large portrait) centered with a second picture of her running below (all in her pink and teal silks), the one I received showed the large clock as shown in the regular 60 Minutes ad that you see on tv with ""Zenyatta"" printed in the bottom corner.  That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  So, if you are only interested in content, don't miss getting this one but if packaging is big, think about it first.",1293494400,5,812,4.2
8419768,5,B004A8ZX50,"Very well done and well rounded.  It presented such a great picture of a wonderfully amazing creature.  I do wish it had included the portion about the young lady who helped to show the reporters around the world of thoroughbreds and racing.  The ""rash to riches"" comment was clever and I hung on every word being so caught up in the wonder of Zenyatta.",1293321600,3,353,4.484375
