1691158,5,B000063RQO,"Definately not for the kids. If you are trying to kick it or had a really bad day at work or school, you need to see this film.  If you are not familiar with the ""nature"" of Red and Meth, this film may be a little wierd to you so stop ""HATIN ON THE MOVIE MAN!"" BUT if you know that these are two crazy ... uh guys (you know) This movie is off the HOOK! And as Redman said in one of his song, ""If you ain't figured it out, laugh now, and figure the .... out when you get home!""

1691159,1,B000063RQO,"Whats to say about this movie? ..Except for the fact that its the single biggest piece of garbage I have ever set my eyes upon.
The Plot of this movie is way too shallow. Famous rappers (Red Man and Method Man) getting As to get to Harvard- then decide to have some er...""fun."" Of course, being rappers, lots of drug and sex references. This is a rapped up version of Legally Blonde. If i were in Harvard Law, I would be ashamed to say I went there after seeing this movie!
I can only think of two reasons why these two idiots made this movie: 1). They were smokin something quite strong or 2). They know in the real world Harvard would laugh in their faces if they applied. Although I wouldn't make Harvard either, I sure as hell don't dumb things down for Society. Do yourself a favor. Dont see this movie. Instead, spend your 8.50 on a movie that contains a brain cell.",1010361600,2,872,4.290909090909091

1691161,3,B000063RQO,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""How High"", it presented a simple plot that interjected fast-witted, urban, yet tasteful comedy.  The genius stroke of casting key characters with minimal parts such as, (Hector Elizondo as the coach of the rowing team), a friendly ghost (a friend who suffers an unfortunate accident), a low-budget pimp, and a character named ""I need money"", formed part what could easily be described as the best urban comedy since ""Friday"".  Method Man and Redman could easily bank on this comedy for future ""hookups"".",1009152000,5,534,5.126436781609195
1691162,2,B000063RQO,"Well here is the deal, this movie is just plain bad.  The storyline is incredibly dumb.  There is really no interesting or different concepts in this film this is basically the naked gun set in a Harvard atmosphere.  Unless your a die hard fan of Redman and Method Man or you are entertained by simplistic and just plain silly jokes than go see it.  If your expecting a funny movie your looking in the wrong place",1009152000,2,413,4.394736842105263

Just  combine  both Red  and  Meth's  street-sense of  humor and  a  soundtrack  that's  fire, and  you  have  a blockbuster like  Friday  was! These  guy's  are  hip-hop's  safe guards. Trust  me!

It's hysterical, and methodman and redman rip it up.  It is BELLYesk, but it's much more of a comedy, not a drama.  And the green product isn't just props, it's real deal, it made for some interesting filming.  When the DVD comes out get that too, it has all the screw up scenes in it, they are just as funny, if not funnier.  There is also some sweet ghetto booty in this too.

1691178,1,B000063RQO,"I went to the movie theater to see this movie. It looked funny in the trailers but its for a specific target audience. Many of the white characters especially males are portrayed as racist or at least jerks. The one and only black female character in college had a scummy white boyfriend. Obviously she dumps him for one of the leads who is a better man. It's offensive that almost anytime a white male character has a black girlfriend in a movie... he is portrayed as a racist or some kind of bad guy. In real life, many nice white males who went out with beautiful black women were harassed by racist black men. And some have been attacked. That is reality. But nobody cares and it's ignored. Movies like this do what? How do they bring people together? In the nineties I met many black women that felt white males would beat them or kill them because they are simply ""white"" males and movies like this just reinforced that ridiculous and prejudicial ignorant belief. Anyone who thinks this movie is hilarious thinks so simply because none of the really bad negative stereotypes apply to them. Its ok to look down on white males or Asian males or any other race as long as you are not that particular race. If you don't like watching a negative stereotype of your own race... then don't be a hypocrite and laugh and encourage negative stereotypes of other races you don't belong to. Personally this movie would have been way better if they simply portrayed hateful people of all races in it. Since that is actual reality. That way it doesn't offend any particular male of any race and ALL people could watch it and enjoy it. Movies are meant to help us escape and have some fun. Not offend. If racism needs to be part of the story for whatever reason... then I suggest show ALL forms of bigotry from all races portrayed in a movie. the irony is... pretending or actually believing only one race can be racist is actually a racist belief. Assuming anyone knows the actual difference between prejudice and racism. I also would have left out the prostitutes in the movie based on comedy. Especially lightly slapping women in the middle and end by a pimp is funny because...? I guess anyone who thinks its funny if they are not a woman who gets beaten nor a prostitute.",1505692800,,2267,4.53170731707317

It doesn't have a great sense of humor, but it manages to illicit the types of laughs it sets out to (I was NOT high when I watched this, although I have been told numerous times that it helps) and so I can't say I was disappointed.  The plot is not anything you'll need to remember.  I mean, Method Man and Red Man smoke a genius (literally, not figuratively) and wind up in Harvard.  After that, well it's rather generic teen/sex/com fun, and it mostly works.

Mostly.

Red Man and Method Man deliver respectable performances considering who they are and what they do (they are by far more superior rappers than actors) and the supporting cast is predictably sufficient for what they need to do.

1691483,1,B000063RQO,"I saw this film for the first time last night.  Two of my friends insisted it was very funny and I needed to see it, so I did.  The beginning of the movie showed promise, and I expected it to be something in the vein of Half-Baked.  It wasn't.  Except for a couple laughable moments, How High is nothing but an incredibly racist piece of trash.  I am white and found the movie endlessly offensive.  I'm disappointed that my friends (also white) enjoyed it at all.

  There is no question that many films have been made that disparage black people and I in no way approve of that, but two wrongs do not make a right.  Every white character in this movie was either a racist jerk or a complete moron.  I'm so tired of seeing these films that treat all Caucasions like wimpy, thoughtless idiots, sending a message of black superiority.  Everybody just needs to stop this kind of nonsense.  It's fine to have a racist character in order to make a point, but this story had absolutely no heart and was utterly dispicable!

  I remember hip-hop culture becoming trendy when I was in my early teens.  Everyone started wearing the baggy clothes and talking like an ignorant gangsta.  I even did it for a while, but soon got over it.  The people who act this way need to grow up.  Life is too short and important to waste being fake.  So many black folks seem to detest other black folks who speak clearly, are educated, and successful.  They say that these people have compromised their own culture and are ""acting white.""  What?!  You cannot act like a different race!  I have all the respect in the world for anyone who wants to make something of themselves and doesn't resign themselves to drugs and violence.  Also, know that blacks who are proper and respectable HATE blacks who embrace the stereotype of lazy pot-smoking loserdom.

  You may think I am taking this movie too seriously since it was intended as a comedy, but I don't think so.  My purpose in writing this review is to say that racism of any kind is not funny.  I hope Method Man and Redman realize that before making another picture.",1187740800,4,2096,4.49468085106383

The rest of the movie is minstrel theater at its unforgiving worst.

The Gayans Brothers?). If you like corny humor ala Half Baked this ones for you. If not then use this one as a projectile for rabid pitbulls.

1691487,5,B000063RQO,"This college professor lives right around the corner from me.  One day we were talking about movies and I told him about one of my favorite guilty pleasures, How High.

I told him it was about this guy who sprinkles his dead friend's ashes into a growing marijuana plant, and when he smokes the plant he can see and speak with ghosts that help him cheat on the SAT and get into Harvard.  Then I told him Spalding Grey was in it.  My professor friend was like, ""wait, what's this movie called again?""  I guess there's a little something here for everybody who enjoys the absurd.

Spalding Gray really did have one of the funniest cameos I've ever seen.  Another thing I liked about this comedy was the way our heroes Jamal and Silas help those around them.  When they first meet their roommates I was all, ""no way these guys are going to get along,"" but then they pull it off.  Actually, Jamal and Silas save all of their friends.  Instead of trying to be what they think they're supposed to be, their friends become who they really want to be.

So why laugh with How High?  It's all of the seemingly random, silly little details they put in there.  Those really get me every time.  The pork chops-a-chunky commercial.  The dialogue between the pimp and the assistant pimp.  Redman thinking that maybe he's a ghost and trying to walk through pedestrians.  Everything that I Need Money does in the background.  Everything Justin Urich says is actually pretty funny.  Actually it's all pretty funny.  Watch the deleted scenes on the DVD.  I remember there being some dream sequence that takes place inside I Need Money's gold tooth, and that was really funny.

If you like a little of the absurd in your comedy, then you may enjoy this flick.

Just keep in mind that the story is about succeeding on your own terms, getting what you want and having some laughs along the way.  The story isn't so much about a realistic portrayal of how different socioeconomic and ethnic groups relate on a college campus.  Fair warning.",1157760000,2,2017,4.567039106145251

1691489,1,B000063RQO,"How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech & Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clichs that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clichs that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.

Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech & Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clich jock, the clich frat boy, the clich Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clich rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.

I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a ""cut and paste"" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!

I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded ""Truth Serum"" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and ""cult-like"" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential ""weed"" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.

Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.

He/she forgets to mention that the character of Silas (Method Man)is a young man who is the neighborhood's drug dealer/""witch"" doctor.  He creates medicine with the drugs he sells, and actually shows some intelligence and interest in his studies.

Also, ""alphaspace"" forgets to mention Obba Babatund who plays the DEAN of Harvard university. He is a (gasp!) black man that is actually trying to keep Silas and Jamal out because of their first impression to him. He thinks they're brain dead, and he does everything he can to get them out of Harvard. Not to mention he forgets the character that Lark Vorhess plays.  She is an intelligence black woman who also goes to Harvard.

The movie makes of all the characters, black white men women. Notice that when you actually sit down and watch the movie. They make fun of Silas and Jamal's roommates, which are actually white and Asian.

Method Man and Redman are not serious actors.  If anything they're more jokers (check out their previous acting experience to see). If anyone takes this film seriously they really have NO IDEA what background the main actors have. This movie doesn't show anything of reality so don't take it so much to heart.

Personally, I like this movie when it came out. There's no meaning to it, and sometimes you need to watch such things. If you're interested in one of those stoner/dumb movies get this.

1691510,4,B000063RQO,"Method Man and Redman show strong comic sensibilities and timing in their debut, How High. The story is funny enough, two bud loving slackers are forced to take the THC exam by their parents. Before the exam, Meth's friend dies and he grinds up his ashes and plants them with high powered cess. The result is that when Meth and Doc blaze before the test, it brings Meth's departed friend Whitey back as a ghost. He's real smart and helps Meth and Doc to ace their tests. The path eventually leads to Harvard and you can pretty much guess what happens from there. I was really surprised at how funny this movie really was and both of these guys have the potential to make some more real funny films, I just hope they do. Mike Epps has the funniest role in the film as a small time pimp whose obsessed with baby powder. The end starts to get a bit crazy(ala Animal House) but this is definitely worth a watch.

Dont expect chekov or anything, this is not a movie to go into w/ high cinematic expectations but expect mindless, funny, stoner ""guy humor"" thats light on gross out (which seems to be way too common today) & heavy on adult humor, classic insults & stereotypes of all kind--which can be funny as long as everyone gets their share...& they do!
the jokes are fast & fresh, the setups are funny & the acting wasn't bad either considering i've never seen meth or red act in anything except a music video. the film was directed by Jesse Dylan (son of Bob) & is the perfect stoner movie that will have you laughing out loud...high or sober. the perfect accompaniment to ""Up in SMoke"" if you & your buddies choose to smoke & laugh your head off one night.",1038182400,2,1084,4.452261306532663
1691513,2,B000063RQO,"I saw a review calling this a poor man's Cheech and Chong, and I have to aggree for the most part.  Fans will appreciate the soundtrack, but in the comedy realm, How High certainly doesn't stack up to its collegiate comedy peers like Road Trip and American Pie 2.
Let me compare it to something similar.  Half-Baked was not a good movie.  It did have Dave Chappelle, though, and it had some pretty funny parts.  It was probably worth the price of admission just to see the Sampson music video.  Anyway, Half-Baked was a movie about a pothead who gets the girl in the end.  It was a low-budget movie with mediocre production, but it had funny parts and an actual storyline.  How High is also a movie about a pothead who gets the girl in the end.  It had a decent budget and some legitimate names producing it, but that couldn't save a story where every element of plot and humor was either laboriously contrived or else predictable enough to see coming ten minutes ahead.  The most interesting part of How High is the cinematography and camera angles, if you overlook the fact that the actual location they were filming wasn't anywhere near Harvard.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far, though, and it seems extremely odd that this movie obviously doesn't take place in New England and that there is a hot black girl (Essence Atkins) with an attitude strutting around campus with the Secret Service because she's supposed to be the Vice President's daughter.
By the time you're five minutes into How High, you've got the idea that every white guy is an imbecile and every black guy is an urban Einstein.  The crackhead in the opening scene is a white hippie.  The Black History professior is a [not very bright] cracker.  The main girl's obnoxious jerk of a white boyfriend Bart might as well just be referred to as ""The Man.""  It's not particularly offensive, it just makes things even more predictable when the whitest good-guy in the film is played by Hector Elizondo, a Spanish guy from Harlem.
The part that keeps you guessing is trying to figure out just who the main characters are.  Is Redman supposed to be a main character?  He certainly doesn't contribute to the plot.  He is just interjected into the storyline when Method Man sees him in a parking lot and they decide to smoke up in his car.  Is Method Man supposed to be a genius?  He seems to know everything, and takes a break from his gangsta slang to correct white people on their grammar, but if he's so smart, why did he have to cheat to get into Harvard, and why does he have to cheat on every test he takes once there?
The main character is a drug dealer.  Method Man and Redman meet in a car billowing with pot smoke.  They need weed to wake up.  They need weed before tests.
It gets better near the end, and there are actually some funny parts.  You get to see them dig up the body of John Quincy Adams and drag it to their dorm to grind up in a blender and smoke.  Lauren discovers the world's first bong invented by Ben Franklin.  The movie closes with Lauren telling her boyfriend that he never satisfied her, then Method Man looks at the camera and says, ""But I can.""  It's the type of thing that worked for Burt Reynolds in 1977, but seems a bit lame in 2001 movie.
One good thing I can say is that a lot of effort was put into the subtitles for the hearing impaired.  They're put on different areas of the screen depending on who's talking, and even included all the lyrics for the songs.",1035072000,8,3473,4.436908517350158

When they smoke weed, it brings about his dead friend as a ghost who knows everything and helps them get the highest score ever on the college placement test.  Harvard finds out about their high scores and actively recruits them.  How High has no plot, no moral message, and the acting is rather bad.

1691515,5,B000063RQO,"I have listened to Wu-Tang Clan since their brilliant first album and have all their albums since and got my wu wear, so natural I rented this film when I saw it at the video store out of curiosity to see what Method Man would be like in a movie.
...
I was totaly blown away though by how high, it was sooooo funny and although to a certain extent it had the tired old plotline, it was still so fresh and full of energy that it is easily the best comedy I have seen in recent memory. The characters played by Method Man and Redman aren't reduced to typical black stereo types and also it's really great that Method Man's charater has intelligence and integraty, I'm sure that anyone like me who listens to his music and respect the talent would hate it if he appeared as a mindless one dimentional joke on screen.
I laughed at every joke in the movie and laughted hard. I found the humor to have more in common with good classic stoner comedies like Cheech & Chong, than any of the Chris Rock/Tucker type of flicks. And when I watched it the next day it was just as funny.
This is the kind of comedy I hope to see more of in future, it really stands out from the other ... out there. If Method Man and Redman aren't enough, Cypress Hill (the only other rap group I like as much as Wu-Tang) also make an appearance.",1032912000,,1314,4.177165354330708
1691516,5,B000063RQO,"""How High"" generates considerable hilarity when it turns loose rappers Method Man and Redman on an unsuspecting Harvard University.
  The way they get there is pretty funny in this raunchy, good-natured comedy from Universal. Written by Dustin Lee Abraham and directed by Jesse Dylan, it features a fine mix of several generations of comic talent plus a terrific soundtrack from its stars. It blends tracks old and new and features cuts from and pairings with other hip-hop artists, which are in turn incorporated into Rockwilder's lively score.
  Method Man's Silas is content to make his living as the medicine man of his Staten Island neighborhood with his herbal brews, caring for his elderly father and spending his money on hookers. He pays no attention to his best friend Ivory (Chuck Davis) urging him to try for medical school until Ivory meets with a freaky fatal accident. To honor his friend's memory, Silas plants some seeds with Ivory's cremated remains, which yield a lush plant with outsized buds. He dutifully decides to submit to a college entrance exam as well.
  Meanwhile, over in New Jersey, Redman's Jamal, after six years of goofing off in junior college, is at last expelled. Jamal's fed-up mother (Anna Maria Horsford, in a gem of a comic turn) points to the pictures of her older son and daughter on her living room wall and reminds him that at least his brother earned a certificate as a trained barber in prison, where he's still doing time, and his sister holds a diploma in weaving hair.
  ""Six years in junior college was not what I had in mind for you,"" she says irately. The prospect of being thrown out propels him to the testing center, where he meets Jamal and shares some smokes derived from those ""Ivory"" buds, only to have the white-suited Ivory emerge from the haze, promising to supply the answers to the exam they have scant hope of passing. (The aura of old Cheech and Chong pothead movies is as strong as a contact high.) Perfect scores zoom the new friends to Harvard, purportedly lacking in multicultural diversity, where Ivory continues to materialize to help out on tests.
  Chasing girls and having fun are Silas and Jamal's top priorities, and as broad as this comedy gets, there's a satirical edge in the clash between the duo's brash style and academic pomposity. They immediately run afoul of the dean (Obba Babatunde), a smug figure of propriety. The casting of the actress who plays the dean's wife--Melissa Peterman, as good a sport as Babatunde--is surely intended to bring to mind an image of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, so similar-looking are the two couples. The dean makes it clear that, in his view, Silas and Jamal are disreputable types he intends to send back to the ghetto--that's his word, and he utters it with undisguised disdain.
  Meanwhile, Silas is taken with Lauren (Lark Voorhies), with whom he shares a class in botany, while Jamal is bowled over by Jamie (Essence Atkins), the daughter of the vice president (Jeffrey Jones), not of Harvard, but of the United States of America. Silas and Jamal's search for a good time culminates in a wild Halloween dorm party complete with pimps and hookers.
  But what's to happen to them when they run out of those special ""Ivory"" buds? Could it be that they would have to buckle down and study? ""How High"" is careful to make it perfectly clear that, like students of every possible background, they have what it takes if only they apply themselves.
  The Harvard University of this film is so much a fantasy that it matters not at all that UCLA is standing in for it; the difference in architecture and age of the two institutions is so radical that even the color of the bricks of their buildings differs in hue. ""How High"" is not really about college life, other than its nearly subliminal nudge about the value of higher learning.
  Although ""How High"" begins to run out of inspiration before it's over, it manages to take some jabs at the hypocrisy and condescension of the snobby academic and social ruling classes and, in turn, at whites who feel compelled to assume blacker-than-black attitudes in communicating with African Americans instead of simply being themselves.
  There's a spirit of generosity to ""How High"" that allows many performers to shine beyond its sharp and amiable stars. They range from such veterans as Spalding Gray, Hector Elizondo, Tracey Walter and Fred Willard to younger comedians like Davis (who's so sly it's a good thing that his Ivory returns as a ghost), Chris Elwood, Dennison Samaroo, Al Shearer, T.J. Thyne, Justin Urich, Trieu Tran and, above all, Mike Epps as the endlessly comical pimp Baby Powder and Scruncho as his put-upon assistant, Baby Wipe.
  That what is often described euphemistically as an ""urban"" comedy such as ""How High"" should turn up amid a clutch of prestigious year-end Oscar contenders is downright subversive--and pleasingly so.",1032825600,,4934,4.8697729988052565
