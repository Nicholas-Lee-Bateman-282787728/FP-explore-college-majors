294806,3,6300270149,This movie includes a cameo appearance by Dale Earnhardt. Isn't that enough to recommend it?,1016236800,2,92,5.2
294807,5,6300270149,"This movie is a great example of an American Classic.  They just don't make movies like this any more.  Burt Reynolds and the entire cast kept me laughing throughout the entire story.  Nascar is America's fastest growing sport and I recommend this for any of it's newest fans.  The cameo appearances by several of that day's top drivers put the finishing touches on a great project by Burt Reynolds and Hal Needham.  Incidentally, this duo were partners in a Nascar team with Harry Gant as the driver along the time this movie was produced.",1006819200,2,540,4.702127659574468
294808,5,6300270149,"as a racer myself, i have to say that this is one of the best race films on the market. It has a great cast and is verey funny. Cameo appearances by real Nascar racers makes it even that much better. It reminds me of what it  is really like at a race track. If you love racing, this is a must see  movie!",957484800,8,304,3.734375
294809,1,6300270149,Ol' Billy Bob needs to set foot outside the trailer park once in a spell and get a good ol' hunk a reality! There is nothing to recommend in this film outside of serving to kill the first phase of Reynold's career. Any  film that features the singing of Nabors is clearly not covered by any law  and should be banned immediately. Are there really people out there who  emjoy good ol' boy humor and macho posturing?,930096000,5,414,4.35064935064935

Sharky's Machine was shot in 1.33:1 and so appears here. I was looking forward to seeing all three; now I'm going to have to think of it as ""Sharky's"" and two imperfect ""bonuses.""

295159,4,6300270149,"I'm a Burt Reynold's fan and I have to say this is the only reason to buy this collection.  However, for racing movie fans, Stroker Ace is hard to beat.  It's definitely better than Driven and far less effective than Days of Thunder.  It offers a comical, honest view of the sport through the life of Stroker Ace, who has secured a ride from a novice car owner intent on leveraging every ounce of Stroker's fame to sell chicken.  It's the only race film to cover sponsorship honestly (sorry Talladega NIghts).

Few know, Burt Reynolds was a stunt man before making it as an actor.  He has always had an affinity for stunt men and this is homage to these icons that entertain us at grave risk to themselves.  Hooper is a stunt packed film that is entirely over-the-top in scope from Westerns to bar brawls to cars, you've never seen all of this in one flick.  It's a solid movie that.

Stroker Ace and Hooper are easy rewatches for me.

Sharky's Machine I just can't get into.  The other two films are worth the price of admission easily.  I'd love to see Bluray versions of both of them.",1423440000,,1087,4.407035175879397

I already own Sharky's Machine and could care less about Stroker Ace but for the price I'm not complaining. It's been a while since I have watched Hooper but I always ranked it as one of Burt's best along with Sharky's Machine, The Longest Yard and Deliverance. As an older person myself I can relate to the slow loss of physical abilities that the passing of time eventually forces on us all. I'm glad I had the good fortune to be able to climb glaciers and raft class 5 whitewater when I was younger. There is what I would call a personal aura that each star has and I like Burt's persona.  There is just something I like about him that shows through in every role that he has played from Quint Asper on Gunsmoke to Lewis Medlock in Deliverance. This movie is defiantly worth owning if you like Burt.",1408147200,2,881,4.365853658536586

Before Schwarzenegger and Stallone, my go-to cinematic action dudes were Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds. Now, there's no doubting that Eastwood is the more celebrated actor and director, while Reynolds's flicks are more often dismissed as lightweight and mindless material. There's truth to that. Yet I find plenty of Burt's stuff entertaining. And several of his movies do have some measures of depth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Longest-Yard-Lockdown-Edition/dp/B0007TKHI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Longest Yard (Lockdown Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starting-Over/dp/B0008KLVBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starting Over</a>, etc.). This particular triple feature dvd set focuses on two of his better films, the atmospheric crime thriller SHARKY'S MACHINE and the very good HOOPER. Rounding the set out is STROKER ACE, which isn't as good.

Before the baby, let's get to the bathwater. 1983's STROKER ACE is harmless and vacuous. If you're into auto racing or just into cars running amuck and slamming into each other, then you might enjoy this one. Plenty of dumb jock shenanigans here, and whirls around the motor speedway. Burt, firmly entrenched in his good-old-boy persona, plays Stroker Ace, one of the top stock-car racers around, and, boy, he knows it. But the flamboyant Stroker learns a lesson in humility when he agrees to be sponsored by a fried chicken franchise, as he signs without first reading the contract. It's not too long before he's parading around in a chicken outfit and having ""fastest chicken in the South"" painted on his race car. And, in between one-upping his main rival (Hardy Boys' Parker Stevenson, cast against type) and his various schemes to get out of his sponsor's contract, Stroker is trying his bestest to bed the buxom but very chaste Sunday school teacher (Loni Anderson).

It all ends well, of course, with Burt zooming over the finish line upside down in his race car and winning the girl. Cooperation from NASCAR and cameos by NASCAR drivers lend a certain authenticity, for whatever that's worth in a film so bogged down by insipid comedy and a forgettable story. Two things going STROKER ACE, though: the theme song sung by the marvelous Charlie Daniels Band and the outtakes shown during the closing credits.

""You can hit him, kick him, generally abuse him. Set him on fire...will amuse him. Heaven knows, he won't hold a grudge."" As HOOPER's theme song will let you know, the Hollywood stunt man tends to live life rough and rugged. Sonny Hooper (Reynolds) is the world's greatest stunt man. But he's getting old and really starting to feel his aches and pains. Nowadays, he stays on top by virtue of sheer guts and lots and lots of pain pills. On the set of the spy epic The Spy Who Laughed at Danger, Hooper begins to second guess his longevity in the business, what with his body breaking down and the arrival of a younger stunt man who's being touted as a ""young Sonny Hooper."" But, before Hooper rides into the sunset, there's one more stunt to do, this undoubtedly his greatest and most dangerous...

HOOPER is a fond cinematic salute to those wild movie stuntmen and women. There's an elegiac flavor to the story as the aging Hooper contemplates hanging it all up, even as machismo wars against good sense. The cast is very good, with Burt, Sally Fields, Jan-Michael Vincent, and James Best (The Dukes of Hazzard's Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane) investing depth into their characters. Oh, and Adam West plays himself. HOOPER was shot in 1978, when special effects were still predominantly achieved with blood, sweat, and tears, instead of CG. Two particular stunts to watch out for are when Hooper drives backwards on the road going 55 miles per hour and, of course, the showpiece sequence near the end, as Hooper and Ski brave that daunting chasm in their rocket-charged car. HOOPER is also noteworthy for reportedly having inspired THE FALL GUY, one of my childhood television staples.

Changing it up now is Burt's taut and sexy crime thriller SHARKY'S MACHINE. This film is supposedly Burt's response to his buddy Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry series. And, truly, SHARKY'S MACHINE stands up very well to Harry Callahan's exploits. Burt directs and stars as a narcotics sergeant in Atlanta PD who gets busted down to the cesspool-like vice squad. As the film goes on, he develops an obsession for a hauntingly beautiful prostitute who had just been murdered. This happens to tie in with his ongoing attempt to take down a shadowy underworld boss who's got his fingers deep in political corruption.

Borrowing from LAURA's key premise, SHARKY'S MACHINE is still very much its own picture, in its grit and moodiness and exciting action pieces. The jazz score sets the melancholy tone, and the love story is surprisingly well developed. The supporting cast is superb, with particular nods to Brian Keith as Papa, Richard Libertini as Nosh, and Bernie Casey as Arch. Burt himself turns in a layered and sensitive performance. And I must say that Rachel Ward is a straight-up stunner as Dominoe. Everything is right with SHARKY'S MACHINE. It's Burt's most perfect film and, hands down, my favorite Burt Reynolds flick (with THE LONGEST YARD a not-that-distant second).

In his heyday, Burt Reynolds was a walking sex symbol and lovable rogue, his box-office reign spanning the mid-70s and early '80s. These three featured films were made during the height of his popularity, with STROKER ACE and HOOPER exemplifying his brand of raucous, good-old-boy comedy. For the asking price, this triple feature isn't a bad get, although, as mentioned, one beef I do have is that all three films aren't in widescreen format. There are two discs, with STROKER ACE and HOOPER on opposide sides of disc 1 and SHARKY'S MACHINE hogging disc 2 to itself. Admittedly pretty barebones stuff, with no bonus features. Still, if you already don't have these films, this collection is worth a look.",1220227200,26,6176,5.169
295459,5,6300270149,The main reason I had bought this movie was because my favorite Nascar driver (R.I.P.) Dale Earnhardt and my bf's favorite (R.I.P.) Neil Bonnet are in it.

295498,3,6300270149,"An often heard line throughout this movie from many of the characters is ""whatever"". That about sums up my reaction to this movie. It is fun at times and has some good lines but it is not a great work. It is silly but entertaining.

Burt Reynolds plays a conceited NASCAR driver who foolishly signs a sponsorship contract with a fried chicken chain. The problem is that the contract he didn't bother to read requires him to do many things that are, frankly, embaressing. He wants out of his contract but the chicken tycoon doesn't want to release him because he is making money. The movie moves back and forth as each tries to gain the upper hands.

There are a few side stories. Burt's handler for the chicken company is played by Loni Anderson. She eventually comes to feel sorry for Burt and they inevitably fall in love. The complication is that Burt is a womanizer used to having his way and Loni is a, gasp, pure as the driven snow virgin. Loni does a superb job of being very decorative but she does manage to come across well as the innocent.

Burt also has a running battle with another driver. This is good for a few occasional gags but is not well developed.

Burt's sidekick is played by Jim Nabors of Gomer Pyle fame. He does a creditable job playing the chief mechanic who is a good hearted pal helps Burt in his scheming as well as on the racetrack.

The entire film plays to stereotypes but is in no way offensive. It provides a nice diversion but is nothing to write home about.",1116374400,4,1495,4.4021739130434785

Stroker Ace needs a sponsor and Ned Beatty, the owner of a fast food chicken franchise, steps in. Stroker becomes known as 'the fastest chicken in the south', which makes him the butt of a lot of jokes at the track. So then he spends the rest of the movie trying to get fired so he doesn't have to do ridiculous things like dress up in chicken suits and cut ribbons at restaurant grand openings.
