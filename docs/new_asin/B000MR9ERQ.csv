8171041,5,B000MR9ERQ,"I got this DVD from the Fairfax Public Library, Virginia. The production brings 2 hours on interesting and relevant material. It focus on French and Californian wines. It is divided in 7 or 8 segments providing interesting information. After the intro on wine, production regions, types of wine in a didactic and amusing (kind of) way, production details it goes into pairing wine with food, selecting a good wine in a restaurant without overpaying and other valuable tips. I found  the interviews with a cook and with a ""Wine Iconoclast""  extremely interesting. The inconoclast offers a candid conversation in ways to enjoy good wines with good price, how to look for value and where to look for value.

This CD costs less than a couple of bottles of reasonable good wine. If you are interested in the subject why not buy it? You will be amused and you will learn a lot. I would not recommend this to any expert with years of wine tasting, wine studying and visits to wineries around the world.

But you are such an expert and get a lot of questions from your friends interested in penetrating the wine world it would be a great item to give it to them or to lend it to them. This will facilitate the conversation and it will speed up their wine general knowledge.

Try it. You'll like it.",1310515200,,1290,4.567099567099567
