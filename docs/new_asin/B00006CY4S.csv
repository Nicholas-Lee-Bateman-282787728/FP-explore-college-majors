1742457,5,B00006CY4S,"These stories are done to perfection! Having read chrysanthemum literally at least one hundred times, I had a pretty good idea of how hte story should look - and lo and behold, it has been brought to life. This is my daughter's favorite video - now we only hope they follow it up with a ""lily"" series!",1174608000,,301,4.298245614035087
1742458,5,B00006CY4S,I'm a special ed teacher for K-1 and my students love these videos.  They add a visual depth to these classic stories.  Don't forget to view the extras and you can also have the words displayed as well.  I find them invaluable for illuminating literature.  Most stories are no more than 7-10 minutes long and so are great for getting students involved quickly. Well worth the price.  Students ask for them over and over again. Get the books too and students begin to engage with the books and get excited keeping up with the video.,1172361600,3,531,4.5473684210526315
1742459,5,B00006CY4S,"Our family has all the Kevin Henkes books, mainly because they appeal to both kids and adults. When I saw that the books were read on DVD, I purchased them without hesitation. These wonderful books are even better when narrated by the likes of Oscar winner Meryl Streep (reading ""Chrysanthemum"")and Golden Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker (who narrates ""Owen""). Included are a few bonus stories (not Henkes) and an option to read alond with the story (in the same format as a sing-a-long show). A wonderful idea! Also look for books like ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" and ""Goodnight, Gorilla"" on DVD published by the same company.",1047513600,16,627,4.9245283018867925
1742460,5,B00006CY4S,"My daughter Molly loved ""Owen"" when I bought it for her a year ago. Then I got ""Chrysanthemum"", then more and more of Henkes' wonderfully delightful, stupendously enjoyable, magnificently superb books. Molly liked them so much, she wanted to rent the video... just assuming EVERYTHING must be available as a video!! Good news, Molly. Now it is!
Of course, when I saw this DVD, I had to order it immediately. I was worried that it would just be pictures from the book with a big-name guest reading the story. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! The animation is simple, flowing gently like Henkes' illustrations. Meryl Streep's reading is a reflection of her well-known talent. She and Sarah Jessica Parker give the readings real heart.
5-year old Molly gives this DVD 5-stars, and so does 8-year old big brother. (And he's a Yu-gi-oh playing, GameBoy-toting, sports-playing ""tough guy""!!! It proves that Henkes brings out a gentle humor in everyone!)
Sorry to gush, but this DVD is worth twice what I paid for it. In fact, I just ordered 2 more for gifts. I just hope they follow up with a ""Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse"" DVD. Or--heaven forbid--a TV show! If you liked the ""Little Bear"" cartoons, you'll like these.",1041984000,24,1214,4.785714285714286

7967264,5,B00006CY4S,Chrysanthemm is a 1st grade book used in our curriculum......this video only enhances the story with a moral message...This is a great entertaining way to teach children values.,1356825600,,177,5.357142857142857
7967265,5,B00006CY4S,"My family loves this DVD. The stories are clever and fun. The pictures have my kids sitting there watching every moment. I personally enjoy hearing Meryl Streep voice the story of Chrysanthemum. She voices every character as only she can do. If you have a little girl, I would recommend this! I also have a  year old boy who enjoys it too. A must have if you own any of the Scholastic collection.",1319414400,,396,4.424657534246576
7967266,5,B00006CY4S,"Chrysanthemum is a great story as are Kevin Henkes other stories, Owen and A Weekend With Wendell.  The other stories in this collection are just as terrific - Monty, Picnic and The Wizard.  For all the stories the animation is wonderful - not too little, not too much.  The production values are good too.  The stories are also narrated by some pretty nifty actresses - Meryl Streep, Sarah Jessica Parker and Mary Beth Hurt.  My favorite story is Picnic a wordless story about a family of mice on picnic who accidentally lose their youngest mouse on the way.  Everything turns out fine, don't worry!",1225497600,,600,4.721153846153846
