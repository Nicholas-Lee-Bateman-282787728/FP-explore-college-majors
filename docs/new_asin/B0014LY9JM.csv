3133533,4,B0014LY9JM,"I love this show! I have been hooked since it first aired. I have watched every season at least twice! It has inspired me to look into some of the history behind the characters that they portray. Though I try to only read up to a point and then stop. I don't want to ruin things like I did with Ragnar. Sadly, I knew his fate by season 2 after I read a bunch about him.
While I understand artistic license and that some of the history has been lost over the years, passed down in only fables and myths, it still saddens me to see how they treated some of the characters and their story in Season 5. I will not include any spoilers, or at least try not to, but the stuff with Aethelwulf, Aethelred and Albert. Seems, most of the Viking incursions actually happened closer to Aethelred's time, not Aethelwulf's. But I am not an expert in History, and have seen many counter arguments by Historians alone.
Season 5 just seemed a little....rushed is all. I loved the way they did the 10th episode and the solo vignettes among the Chaos was amazing. But I would have liked to see some pause in the fighting so the soldiers could watch the leaders duel, but that's just a personal like to that kinda fight. All in all, Vikings is an amazing show, but you can tell that it is trying to wrap up quickly. I would imagine Season 5, part 2 is going to be it. When it is, I shall lift my mug and shout a hearty ""SKOAL"" to all that we were able to enjoy!

SPOILER!

Yes. Flatnose is Edge AKA Adam Copeland.",1526169600,,1493,4.198606271777003
3133534,5,B0014LY9JM,Great Series!!!,1526083200,,15,7.0
3133535,4,B0014LY9JM,"Is it me or are these later 'Viking' just a horde of undisciplined men?
Remember the ""Shield Walls""? Now they just run at each other in one-on-one combat.
Charge!

Part two will be the defeated given an opportunity to settle down in what will become ""Normandy"" France and be the subjects of you know who.....",1526083200,,308,4.6
3133536,3,B0014LY9JM,"Up until this season many of the characters had a screen presence and command that made them larger than life and easy to believe as figures lore had elevated them to. This season there are no standouts and the ""Vikingness"" is muted. The story in England isn't as compelling as it was either. Still, even diminished this is an entertaining tale.",1526083200,,345,4.672131147540983
3133537,5,B0014LY9JM,I love everything about this show. If you're even remotely interested or curious- just watch it! Start at season 1 obviously.,1525996800,,125,5.0
3133538,4,B0014LY9JM,"First, let me lead with that I have watched all the episodes and I am a huge fan. This latest 5th season is laking what the others had. Before you were following Ragnor around and seeing his journey unfold as well as Lagitha and Bjorn. This season there is too many stories being tossed around and creating a whiplash effect in following.

The story is still pretty good but as others have listed in their reviews, some of the ""Main"" characters are lacking in depth. This could be due to having so many additional storylines added in or just that the writers are at a loss. The writers also made the mistake of killing off some very loved and potentially astonishing characters this season, so be ready.

This season as the rest is worth the watch and I highly recommend it. Every show has its issues and we can only hope that in the following season the writers and the creative team learn from their mistakes and give the fans something better in Season 6.",1525996800,,958,4.468571428571429

3133540,3,B0014LY9JM,"I loved the first 4 seasons. It misses something in the 5th...I don't really care about Ragnar's sons the way I couldn't wait to watch Ragnar and the gang. It's like they have run out of good plot lines. Okay, I get it...Ivar's evil. The series has lost its soul.",1525824000,,263,4.28
3133541,4,B0014LY9JM,Good Show,1525824000,,9,4.0
3133542,4,B0014LY9JM,"Very good show. It used to closely follow actual historical events, but I fear that at the end of season five part one. They killed off a very important historical character, before the period of his actual death. For anyone who knows, The Last Kingdom can be considered a companion show Vikings. It shows some of these very Vikings later in life. Vikings killed off Guthrum in battle in a field in Norway. When in real life he is much older while invading England with Ubbe. He is an Earl that later converts to Christianity, and changes his name. thelstan or thelred becomes his new name.",1525737600,,590,4.5754716981132075
3133543,5,B0014LY9JM,THE SERIES MAKES YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE VIKING AGE.  THE SETS ARE VERY WELL DONE. ACTORS ARE GREAT.  THE BEST SERIES I HAVE SEEN.,1525651200,,133,3.888888888888889
3133544,5,B0014LY9JM,"my great grandfather came over to the USA from Oslo Norway and I saw Viking similarities in some of this yet mostly it was embellished beyond belief for television viewing. Yet if you watch it without a critical attitude
and just enjoy it as a story on its own account without looking for historical accuracy then it is a great show.
For those who feel the need to pick it apart- I seriously doubt you could orchestrate a better production nor can you or I fathom the work it took to make the show",1525651200,,497,4.297872340425532
3133545,5,B0014LY9JM,"Season five was well done; the saga continued as strong a ever; Ivar's role is incredible, ever has madness been so ably portrayed. I'd love to see more by this actor.  When can a season six be expected.",1525564800,,203,4.342105263157895
3133546,1,B0014LY9JM,Haven't watched this show since season 3 when they all started attempting to be floki. Not everything needs to be said in sing-song and their head bobbing is annoying as hell once you start noticing every single character doing it.,1525564800,,231,4.8
3133547,5,B0014LY9JM,love this show.,1525478400,,15,4.333333333333333

3133549,5,B0014LY9JM,"I love it! It made me laugh, dream, think, and, of course, cry... Absolutely amazing experience. I started watching when the 1st season aired. Continued on to the 2nd and 3rd. Somewhere in between it got to be a ""meh"" as the episodes became less dynamic, but the show picked up again when the new characters were introduced. I love the writing -  you follow a simple farmer in to the greater unknowns, see how he makes mistakes and uses his creativity, you then grow as his children grow and the story evolves. Every character is shown in a lot of detail, you get to know everyone's story intimately. On how it is filmed: with the visions and hallucinations (whatever those are) it becomes a bit confusing, hard to keep track on what is happening. But, I enjoyed how they blended/depictions different languages. Also, all the actors are from Europe, very refreshing. Cant wait for the next season!",1525478400,,897,4.677215189873418
3133550,2,B0014LY9JM,"Really bad, terrible fight choreography, uninteresting plot, about half of the characters basically don't have any personality. Not a lot of positives, this show has been getting worse since about season 2.",1525478400,2,206,5.46875
3133551,5,B0014LY9JM,"It is a story. Not fantasy. Not realistic. Not history. It is hard to say whether it is about the Vikings or the modern age (post-Sarajevo, post-ISIS) where we now know the horrors of the past are never actually past-tense.",1525392000,,223,4.6
3133552,5,B0014LY9JM,"I have loved this show from the very start. I do miss Ragnar, but what a quality show. I love that is based on a true story and that the women have a strong voice. I will be sad when it ends. I may be alone in this belief, but I like this show even more than I like GOT.",1525392000,,270,3.5166666666666666

3133554,5,B0014LY9JM,"They could not have picked a better person to play the part of Ivar.  His expressions when he is crawling around, he looks just like an evil serpent.  Well played.",1525305600,,163,4.4
3133555,2,B0014LY9JM,"A lot of gore in this series, but being historically accurate they have to show this.  It's quite disgusting and foul what a lot of these people did and the way they behaved, on all sides.  Another interesting series on ""royalty"" that shows they are nothing more than common greedy, arrogant, lying, deceiving and war ravaging commoners.  Children in ""big"" bodies.",1525305600,,364,4.934426229508197

3133563,4,B0014LY9JM,"I must say that Ragnar Lodbrok is missed. But, the sheer brutality and savageness makes it one of the finest seasons.

3133565,3,B0014LY9JM,"First three seasons were nothing less than epic. 4th season took a turn for the worst, then season 5 is pretty much a drag, they have killed their main star, Ragnar, it's like shooting yourself in the foot, why do that? he was such an interesting character, they could have created many seasons about his trips the sons are boring including Bjorn, the other 3 lack everything that made the show so good, watching the psychopathic Ivar is painful to say the least. oh how much I miss the adventures that Ragnar and his kinsmen went through in the first 3 seasons, how much I miss the wit and cunning the vikings had under his rule, his humor and character was one of a kind.
I will be surprised if the show gets to season 6, because it has lost all that was so great about it and at this point is just dragging.",1525046400,,810,4.266233766233766

3133570,2,B0014LY9JM,"First 4 seasons were engrossing - good character development and great writing and with a story to tell.  Season 5 was just confusing.  Hard to keep track of some of the new characters and how they fit in. And episode 10 was just hard to watch, no continuity and hard to follow.",1524873600,,278,4.326923076923077
3133571,5,B0014LY9JM,Vikings has quickly become my favorite show to watch. The characters are amazing and very interesting. Now to wait for the next season to begin!,1524873600,,144,4.8
3133572,5,B0014LY9JM,"At the outset I expected the HISTORY channel to be historically accurate.
Obviously, the facts and time line are juggled to make it compress and play to an audience better.
I finally just let go and decided that in the real history there had to have been more stories in their lives than were recorded into what we accept as their history, . . . . so, these could be those stories, and if they're not, maybe they should have been.
It's the best Norsemen and Viking/Raider/Trader/Farmer portrayal ever done, and the look, feel, and good faith effort to resurrect our ancestors spirit and heart, gets my vote . . . . five stars.",1524700800,,626,4.5
3133573,1,B0014LY9JM,"Season 5 is complete trash. No character development, no new characters(none worth mentioning and certainly none worth remembering), no twists or even slightly unpredictable events, and constant flashbacks. Even the battles are filled with so much drama they can't be enjoyed. Battles which consist of no tactics. Seriously boring. The end of Season 4 left me super excited for what was to follow. Honestly though, after Ragnar forgot his ways and slowly turned into a sap, this useless season does not come as a surprise. Every great binge worthy show starts off slow and builds up, but this is Season 5.... I can only hope that part 2 justifies the time seemingly wasted from this first half of season 5.",1524614400,,706,4.891666666666667

3133639,5,B0014LY9JM,I revisited this series when it became available under Amazon Prime For a few weeks I watched through seasons 1-4. I saw the remarkable evolution of the main characters as they move through the storyline. The portrayal of women in this series as warriors and leaders gives depth to this show. The battle scenes are well done and worth watching particularly of season 5. I am totally enthralled with the Seer of whom the main characters go for their futures to be told. Much is foreshadowed with these encounters. I simply like this series and enjoy its tales.,1518307200,,559,4.714285714285714

Warrior Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Bishop Heahmund) at the end of season 4 left us waiting for more bloody wars for the season 5. Lagertha, Bjorn, Floki, King Harald Finehair and Bishop Heahmund are the main characters in season 5 who continue to keep this action, adventures,drama, romance and war raging Viking tale interesting.

I honestly thought I would be disappointed after the death of Ragnar and so many of the main characters but Michael Hirst and his crew just keep giving us these amazing performances that do not disappoint!  This is truly addictive.  I hate it when I cannot binge watch and when there are no episodes left but I am looking forward to what lies ahead in future episodes and hopefully future series.  Truly creative, spectacular, with twists and turns all along the way.  I have really enjoyed Vikings!  Thank you to all who have been a part of this amazing historical account of my heritage and part of my distant ancestry!  Although I am aware that many of the things portrayed are not 100% accurate I have learned many things about the Vikings that I would have never known apart from this series.  As a child my mother would always tell me that my ancestors were Vikings but I had no clue as to what that meant so this has been an intrigue to watch!

3133677,4,B0014LY9JM,"Definitely different historical connections involved as I seek to understand what really occurred and perhaps what is packed into a storyline for covienece. It seems like some episodes are forced such as the progression of Alfred to king. Some of the scenes made me truly wonder...like attacking York- Ivar coming up out of manholes could have been killed easily. I also feel some of the main characters could be developed much more using their pasts and history from within the show to demonstrate connection and deeper meaning as they age, progress and go to war for their people. Legertha is an amazing character with richer history then what is used for example. Still it is exciting to watch the battles, explore historical accuracy in light of the talented wardrobe, hair, makeup and wait to see how relationships will unfold in the cultural family drama.",1516752000,,861,4.986111111111111
3133678,3,B0014LY9JM,"I knew there would be a big change in the show once Travis Fimmel (Ragnar) and other major characters were killed off. I suspected the show would not be nearly as good and it has proven to be the case. The story lines are implausible. I think they are working up to the battle between the Great Heathen Army and Alfred (Alfred the Great), but even that story line is tainted by ridiculous situations and mixed up historical situations (for example, it was King Alfred who escaped to the marshes with a few men-led by Guthrum-after the north men overran Chippenham during Christmas celebrations). There are so many other inaccuracies with characters and story lines. This is not at all what I would have expected from Michael Hirst who I consider generally good with historical fiction.

I have always despised the IVAR character. The actor who plays him is okay, but the character is totally one dimensional and I am tired of his screaming and psycho demeanor. Enough already. IVAR trained under Floki, in the religious ways of his culture, not in warfare and tactics from his father. It is implausible that he would be a clever war tactician. And really, that scene with one Viking at a time coming out of the manholes of York during the siege, not only would that not have happened, but it would have been an all out slaughter with the Saxon's picking off hapless Vikings one by one as they emerged.

If the show continues on this vein, I won't watch any longer. Such a shame. I loved the first few seasons of the show. But now, not really.",1516752000,6,1542,4.583333333333333

3133681,1,B0014LY9JM,"I liked previous seasons of this series a lot-- enough to purchase season 5.  Sadly, it falls off a cliff.  It's as if the writing has been handed over to high school kids whose strategy is to have the characters first say the obvious and then act on it.  ""I think we should attack York through the conveniently unguarded portions of crumbling Roman wall.""  ""Yes, but first we must check that the unguarded portions are in fact unguarded.""  ""We have checked and found that the crumbling portions of the Roman wall are conveniently unguarded."" ""Let us now attack York through the unguarded portions of the wall...""

3133686,4,B0014LY9JM,"Ivar really is the one character currently saving this Season. The actor (Alex) is doing such an amazing job. However, the writing this season is really lacking in comparison to its predecessors. Several situations build up Ivar's character in battle, but nothing really happens (he just stands or sits screaming without actually doing anything). And that scene where he comes up with a plan to hide the army underground resulted in a scene that defies common sense. Again, the actor did an amazing job despite the bad writing, but... coming out of the ground like that creates a bottle neck: Only one Viking can come out at a time. Sure there were multiple manholes they came from, but it was less than a dozen. The English could have stopped that quite easily. Instead the English stood there shocked for a very long time as Viking after Viking slowly came up. Whoever wrote that battle sequence was too caught up in giving Ivar's character a ""battle trick"" and not focusing enough on sensibility. This is just one example but there are several others throughout the season thus far.

The other characters have the potential to do so much more (I loved these characters last season). But again... it is the writing that is forcing many of the characters in to playing a watered down version of themselves. I hope the writing improves soon, the show and the actors deserve better.",1516060800,2,1381,4.7782426778242675

Based on the historical fiction of the Norseman, the first few seasons were captivating with Travis as Ragnar, the great Viking warrior. Now Jonathan Rhys Meyers is starring in the current season, and his acting skills will propel it to an exciting season.  If Hollywood is embracing strong woman portrayals, then they should look no further than ""The Vikings"", as these are the fiercest women warriors in current media.  It is so interesting to think about how this group were able to invade, and then integrate with our ancestors in England, France and other countries, and many of us may have traces of their DNA in our composition.",1515628800,2,722,4.853658536585366

I almost went through an entire box of tissues just on what King Aelle & his men did to Ragnar alone in Season 5.... And they call themselves ""Christians""? That was way worse than what any of them did to anyone. I was hoping for Ivar to shove Aelle in the snake pit like what they did to his father but the scum got off too easy.

I'm missing Ragnar and Rollo, but intrigued by the sons' continuing struggles against each other. And I love seeing Floki finally coming into his own outside of Kattegat and ship building. The chemistry between Ivar and Bishop Heahmund is also compelling drama; they're both strong and wicked. I just wish that if Season 5 is going to be in 2 parts that we had the option of buying the WHOLE season up front as we did for Season 4.",1514678400,,585,4.4766355140186915

3133714,5,B0014LY9JM,"I have never gotten into any show like this before and I am hooked. I love this show!!!!! I literally cried and hoped Ragnar was not really dead. It could be because I thought the show couldn't go on without him, because I wanted him and lagertha(hope that's the right spelling) to be together again, or heck maybe because I think he is amazingly beautiful lol. Either way I love the acting and seriously hope one of Ragnar's boys doesn't kill Lagertha. Omg I love her. She is my new girl crush and a beast on the battlefield. Anywho....do I really have to pay for season 5? I don't pay extra for tv shows and this will bum me out. After reading about the real characters it seems Rollo might not be back either but hopefully Bjorn and the brothers will get a chance to kick his a$$. I seriously hope they find a way to bring Ragnar's spirit back for guidance to the boys (i just want to see him again).

I have to admit that it is not the same without Ragnar, Rollo, Athlestan... especially Ragnar/Travis. He made the show happen. However I believe that this is still a 5 star show. I don't understand why people give it 2 or 3 stars or less. Before, I agree with everybody, it was so much better, it was a 100 star show, and now, it has not become 2 star show. It is still great. Lagherta/ Katheryn is great character/actress. Also Ivar has a lot of personality and can't be missed.

On the periphery, the fate of his sons, wives, allies and enemies loomed a quiet storm.  Here, now, the clouds finally break.  The madness he left behind has allowed for the creation of a top-notch show as unpredictable as the Vikings themselves.  In this season, the incomplete characters of the past finally reveal the hands they have been quietly playing.  Always a sinful pleasure, this series has now become one of the richest and most original fare one can find.

He is brilliant and in a league of his own on the show, and actually, despite being a complete horror on the show, makes the show entirely worth watching because of his acting.

I would rank it up there with classics like The Wire, X-Files, Sopranos, and other series that have produced the finest narratives ever told on TV. From season 1 to this point, the journey has been amazingly exciting, dangerous, thrilling and sometimes cruel and violent. The Vikings were a truly unique race of people, with a unique culture, religion, lore, and ways of living that really define what this show is all about - a deep dive into what the life of a Viking tribal king, Ragnar Lothbrok(sp) is like, as he conquers and expands his reach he faces new challenges and great danger along the way - this show has it all, great acting, incredible story lines, great set design and location shoots - its a wonderful series.

3368030,4,B0014LY9JM,"I love this show! I have been hooked since it first aired. I have watched every season at least twice! It has inspired me to look into some of the history behind the characters that they portray. Though I try to only read up to a point and then stop. I don't want to ruin things like I did with Ragnar. Sadly, I knew his fate by season 2 after I read a bunch about him.
While I understand artistic license and that some of the history has been lost over the years, passed down in only fables and myths, it still saddens me to see how they treated some of the characters and their story in Season 5. I will not include any spoilers, or at least try not to, but the stuff with Aethelwulf, Aethelred and Albert. Seems, most of the Viking incursions actually happened closer to Aethelred's time, not Aethelwulf's. But I am not an expert in History, and have seen many counter arguments by Historians alone.
Season 5 just seemed a little....rushed is all. I loved the way they did the 10th episode and the solo vignettes among the Chaos was amazing. But I would have liked to see some pause in the fighting so the soldiers could watch the leaders duel, but that's just a personal like to that kinda fight. All in all, Vikings is an amazing show, but you can tell that it is trying to wrap up quickly. I would imagine Season 5, part 2 is going to be it. When it is, I shall lift my mug and shout a hearty ""SKOAL"" to all that we were able to enjoy!

3368035,4,B0014LY9JM,"First, let me lead with that I have watched all the episodes and I am a huge fan. This latest 5th season is laking what the others had. Before you were following Ragnor around and seeing his journey unfold as well as Lagitha and Bjorn. This season there is too many stories being tossed around and creating a whiplash effect in following.

The story is still pretty good but as others have listed in their reviews, some of the ""Main"" characters are lacking in depth. This could be due to having so many additional storylines added in or just that the writers are at a loss. The writers also made the mistake of killing off some very loved and potentially astonishing characters this season, so be ready.

This season as the rest is worth the watch and I highly recommend it. Every show has its issues and we can only hope that in the following season the writers and the creative team learn from their mistakes and give the fans something better in Season 6.",1525996800,,958,4.468571428571429

Somewhere in between it got to be a ""meh"" as the episodes became less dynamic, but the show picked up again when the new characters were introduced. I love the writing -  you follow a simple farmer in to the greater unknowns, see how he makes mistakes and uses his creativity, you then grow as his children grow and the story evolves. Every character is shown in a lot of detail, you get to know everyone's story intimately. On how it is filmed: with the visions and hallucinations (whatever those are) it becomes a bit confusing, hard to keep track on what is happening. But, I enjoyed how they blended/depictions different languages. Also, all the actors are from Europe, very refreshing. Cant wait for the next season!",1525478400,,897,4.677215189873418

3368048,5,B0014LY9JM,"It is a story. Not fantasy. Not realistic. Not history. It is hard to say whether it is about the Vikings or the modern age (post-Sarajevo, post-ISIS) where we now know the horrors of the past are never actually past-tense.",1525392000,,223,4.6

3368052,2,B0014LY9JM,"A lot of gore in this series, but being historically accurate they have to show this.  It's quite disgusting and foul what a lot of these people did and the way they behaved, on all sides.  Another interesting series on ""royalty"" that shows they are nothing more than common greedy, arrogant, lying, deceiving and war ravaging commoners.

3368062,3,B0014LY9JM,"First three seasons were nothing less than epic. 4th season took a turn for the worst, then season 5 is pretty much a drag, they have killed their main star, Ragnar, it's like shooting yourself in the foot, why do that? he was such an interesting character, they could have created many seasons about his trips the sons are boring including Bjorn, the other 3 lack everything that made the show so good, watching the psychopathic Ivar is painful to say the least. oh how much I miss the adventures that Ragnar and his kinsmen went through in the first 3 seasons, how much I miss the wit and cunning the vikings had under his rule, his humor and character was one of a kind.
I will be surprised if the show gets to season 6, because it has lost all that was so great about it and at this point is just dragging.",1525046400,,810,4.266233766233766

3368069,5,B0014LY9JM,"At the outset I expected the HISTORY channel to be historically accurate.
Obviously, the facts and time line are juggled to make it compress and play to an audience better.
I finally just let go and decided that in the real history there had to have been more stories in their lives than were recorded into what we accept as their history, . . . . so, these could be those stories, and if they're not, maybe they should have been.
It's the best Norsemen and Viking/Raider/Trader/Farmer portrayal ever done, and the look, feel, and good faith effort to resurrect our ancestors spirit and heart, gets my vote . . . . five stars.",1524700800,,626,4.5
3368070,1,B0014LY9JM,"Season 5 is complete trash. No character development, no new characters(none worth mentioning and certainly none worth remembering), no twists or even slightly unpredictable events, and constant flashbacks. Even the battles are filled with so much drama they can't be enjoyed. Battles which consist of no tactics. Seriously boring. The end of Season 4 left me super excited for what was to follow. Honestly though, after Ragnar forgot his ways and slowly turned into a sap, this useless season does not come as a surprise. Every great binge worthy show starts off slow and builds up, but this is Season 5.... I can only hope that part 2 justifies the time seemingly wasted from this first half of season 5.",1524614400,,706,4.891666666666667

3368136,5,B0014LY9JM,I revisited this series when it became available under Amazon Prime For a few weeks I watched through seasons 1-4. I saw the remarkable evolution of the main characters as they move through the storyline. The portrayal of women in this series as warriors and leaders gives depth to this show. The battle scenes are well done and worth watching particularly of season 5. I am totally enthralled with the Seer of whom the main characters go for their futures to be told. Much is foreshadowed with these encounters. I simply like this series and enjoy its tales.,1518307200,,559,4.714285714285714

Warrior Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Bishop Heahmund) at the end of season 4 left us waiting for more bloody wars for the season 5. Lagertha, Bjorn, Floki, King Harald Finehair and Bishop Heahmund are the main characters in season 5 who continue to keep this action, adventures,drama, romance and war raging Viking tale interesting.

3368159,5,B0014LY9JM,"What an amazing series! The best I have ever seen! I have now watched the entire series three times and just finished watching Series 5. I honestly thought I would be disappointed after the death of Ragnar and so many of the main characters but Michael Hirst and his crew just keep giving us these amazing performances that do not disappoint!  This is truly addictive.  I hate it when I cannot binge watch and when there are no episodes left but I am looking forward to what lies ahead in future episodes and hopefully future series.  Truly creative, spectacular, with twists and turns all along the way.  I have really enjoyed Vikings!  Thank you to all who have been a part of this amazing historical account of my heritage and part of my distant ancestry!  Although I am aware that many of the things portrayed are not 100% accurate I have learned many things about the Vikings that I would have never known apart from this series.  As a child my mother would always tell me that my ancestors were Vikings but I had no clue as to what that meant so this has been an intrigue to watch!

3368174,4,B0014LY9JM,"Definitely different historical connections involved as I seek to understand what really occurred and perhaps what is packed into a storyline for covienece. It seems like some episodes are forced such as the progression of Alfred to king. Some of the scenes made me truly wonder...like attacking York- Ivar coming up out of manholes could have been killed easily. I also feel some of the main characters could be developed much more using their pasts and history from within the show to demonstrate connection and deeper meaning as they age, progress and go to war for their people. Legertha is an amazing character with richer history then what is used for example. Still it is exciting to watch the battles, explore historical accuracy in light of the talented wardrobe, hair, makeup and wait to see how relationships will unfold in the cultural family drama.",1516752000,,861,4.986111111111111
3368175,3,B0014LY9JM,"I knew there would be a big change in the show once Travis Fimmel (Ragnar) and other major characters were killed off. I suspected the show would not be nearly as good and it has proven to be the case. The story lines are implausible. I think they are working up to the battle between the Great Heathen Army and Alfred (Alfred the Great), but even that story line is tainted by ridiculous situations and mixed up historical situations (for example, it was King Alfred who escaped to the marshes with a few men-led by Guthrum-after the north men overran Chippenham during Christmas celebrations). There are so many other inaccuracies with characters and story lines. This is not at all what I would have expected from Michael Hirst who I consider generally good with historical fiction.

I have always despised the IVAR character. The actor who plays him is okay, but the character is totally one dimensional and I am tired of his screaming and psycho demeanor. Enough already. IVAR trained under Floki, in the religious ways of his culture, not in warfare and tactics from his father. It is implausible that he would be a clever war tactician. And really, that scene with one Viking at a time coming out of the manholes of York during the siege, not only would that not have happened, but it would have been an all out slaughter with the Saxon's picking off hapless Vikings one by one as they emerged.

If the show continues on this vein, I won't watch any longer. Such a shame. I loved the first few seasons of the show. But now, not really.",1516752000,6,1542,4.583333333333333

3368178,1,B0014LY9JM,"I liked previous seasons of this series a lot-- enough to purchase season 5.  Sadly, it falls off a cliff.  It's as if the writing has been handed over to high school kids whose strategy is to have the characters first say the obvious and then act on it.  ""I think we should attack York through the conveniently unguarded portions of crumbling Roman wall.""  ""Yes, but first we must check that the unguarded portions are in fact unguarded.""  ""We have checked and found that the crumbling portions of the Roman wall are conveniently unguarded."" ""Let us now attack York through the unguarded portions of the wall..."" Etc., etc., episode after episode, ad nauseam.  And Ragnar's sons are witless, poorly imagined imitations of their father and can't carry the series.

3368183,4,B0014LY9JM,"Ivar really is the one character currently saving this Season. The actor (Alex) is doing such an amazing job. However, the writing this season is really lacking in comparison to its predecessors. Several situations build up Ivar's character in battle, but nothing really happens (he just stands or sits screaming without actually doing anything). And that scene where he comes up with a plan to hide the army underground resulted in a scene that defies common sense. Again, the actor did an amazing job despite the bad writing, but... coming out of the ground like that creates a bottle neck: Only one Viking can come out at a time. Sure there were multiple manholes they came from, but it was less than a dozen. The English could have stopped that quite easily. Instead the English stood there shocked for a very long time as Viking after Viking slowly came up. Whoever wrote that battle sequence was too caught up in giving Ivar's character a ""battle trick"" and not focusing enough on sensibility. This is just one example but there are several others throughout the season thus far.

The other characters have the potential to do so much more (I loved these characters last season). But again... it is the writing that is forcing many of the characters in to playing a watered down version of themselves. I hope the writing improves soon, the show and the actors deserve better.",1516060800,2,1381,4.7782426778242675

Based on the historical fiction of the Norseman, the first few seasons were captivating with Travis as Ragnar, the great Viking warrior. Now Jonathan Rhys Meyers is starring in the current season, and his acting skills will propel it to an exciting season.  If Hollywood is embracing strong woman portrayals, then they should look no further than ""The Vikings"", as these are the fiercest women warriors in current media.  It is so interesting to think about how this group were able to invade, and then integrate with our ancestors in England, France and other countries, and many of us may have traces of their DNA in our composition.",1515628800,2,722,4.853658536585366

I almost went through an entire box of tissues just on what King Aelle & his men did to Ragnar alone in Season 5.... And they call themselves ""Christians""? That was way worse than what any of them did to anyone. I was hoping for Ivar to shove Aelle in the snake pit like what they did to his father but the scum got off too easy.

Either way I love the acting and seriously hope one of Ragnar's boys doesn't kill Lagertha. Omg I love her. She is my new girl crush and a beast on the battlefield. Anywho....do I really have to pay for season 5? I don't pay extra for tv shows and this will bum me out.

The madness he left behind has allowed for the creation of a top-notch show as unpredictable as the Vikings themselves.

Alex Andersen's amazing portrayal as ""Ivar the Boneless,"" is not something to be missed.

The Vikings were a truly unique race of people, with a unique culture, religion, lore, and ways of living that really define what this show is all about - a deep dive into what the life of a Viking tribal king, Ragnar Lothbrok(sp) is like, as he conquers and expands his reach he faces new challenges and great danger along the way - this show has it all, great acting, incredible story lines, great set design and location shoots - its a wonderful series.

Many longtime fans are variations of disappointed or angry compared to all these glowing reviews. But, its kind of like The Twilight Saga - except men have been drinking the koolaid too, ha! This is a partial list of major writing manipulation$ collected from fans.

The biggies are numbers 1-4, and the last one (#16) - while #5 is the main reason for all this dysfunction, and #13 is a BOMB. At least check those out if this seems too long for you. Spoilers, but things are vague enough. It might even inspire you to watch the entire series again, out of curiosity.

This review will also be updated after the 2nd half drops. Many of us are hoping for miracle fixes - or at least, scenes that will make some of this stuff more acceptable. Also, lots of work went into this (too much, LoL!) - including re-watching the entire series for accuracy. If you think this info is valuable for paying consumers, please scroll down and 'like' so that it floats up on Amazon's critical review list.

Think I'm a lone crazy person? I found this critical review on Forbes - 'Vikings' Season 5, Episode 10 Review: A Bad Midseason Finale To A Bad Season - by Erik Kain. Do a search - it backs up some of this stuff, while elaborating on other problems. Also, search out critical reviews from fans in YouTube video comments, Reddit and places like that - often buried by panicky obsessives, same as here.

Really, if you don't care about any of the characters (including Ivar) nor the storylines that brought us here - then go watch WWE where sensationalism matters over characters and plotlines. This is how things are supposed to go: respect the intelligence of your fans, create something worthwhile, and we will continue to buy your stuff and sing your praises.

The word 'childish' has often been used to describe the writing this season - and while it has always had a debatable reputation, the writing has never been this bad. Whole character arcs and storylines (and logic) have been re-written or brushed off to hype the shrill, 'intoxicating' character of Ivar - and it worked, specifically to keep current fans from missing Ragnar; and to draw in heaps of GoT fans. It isn't just the news that can grossly-succeed when being fake-hyped.

This is a rare, HONEST review of the character of Ivar:

~~~~~~~~~ #1 ~~~~~~~~~~
They did a great job casting Ivar as both a child and an adult. He was the only young son of Ragnar's that had a little substance to him because of his legs. Both his parents fussed and quarreled over him; plus the little boy who played Ivar as a child did as good a job as his adult counterpart. We saw him bossing his mother around and killing another child, etc. And, that smile! His whole face would light up!

Also, Ragnar took him to England, and they had an interactive adventure together. It would have been helpful if all the boys had something like that. Ubbe & Hvitserk went with him to Paris as children, but we saw very little bonding happen among them.

Twisting that trip was just the start of selling Ivar to us: one of the most irritating things about him now is that he keeps claiming 'father chose ME to go to England with him' - as his main argument that he should lead the Great Army. When in fact, Ivar was the only son who was willing to go with Ragnar - after none of the other brothers would even consider going.

The actor who plays adult Ivar, Alex Hgh Andersen, DOES do an amazing job with the material he has to work with - he is an impressive yelling machine, however exciting that is to each person watching. If it didn't matter that the series ALSO have believable scenes and storylines, this show might still be as good as previous seasons - just because of Ivar and even without Ragnar. Ivar is an adorable bad boy, vulnerable, sweet, bratty and ruthless all at the same time. It would be really nice if he was being ruthless to the English (instead of his family) and using his anger intelligently - like his father told him to do (see also numbers 12 & 16).

After having just re-watched all the seasons, it isn't surprising that Ivar is carrying the show like this, now - Ragnar/Travis somehow did it despite all kinds of bad writing while he reigned. Michael Hirst seriously needed a writing team aside from himself. I think it has mostly been the characters and the actors behind them, that made this show compelling, BECAUSE most of the characters (and the culture) already had exciting reputations that we were curious about.

- and dang, we really wanted to hear their stories! (Really, why is it okay for Vikings creators to cash in on this beloved ancient civilization like this with such manipulative contempt for their audience?)

~~~~~~~~~ #2 ~~~~~~~~~~
You hear this a lot: none of the new characters have depth. We were not even attached to Ragnar's young sons well-enough for them to be able to carry the show without him, yet. They suddenly became adults. I am willing to bet that the show could have been handed off to them IF we had watched them grow into young men with Ragnar. (Really? Ragnar abandons the young sons that he just HAD to have - and they are supposedly his weakness - because what happened in Paris BROKE him?!)

PLUS, this season was both loaded and rushed. Everything they put into it - with all the different storylines and places they have gone in this certain amount of time could not have happened. I can't imagine what the huge hurry was.

~~~~~~~~~ #3 ~~~~~~~~~~
The battle tactics are a joke, and the saddest thing about that is that they ALL could have been done in a much more impressive & satisfying way that would have actually glorified Ivar. But, unbelievable scenes play out that would not work that way; and are explained away as 'Ivar being brilliant'. The English army are portrayed as bumbling idiots over & over. Its probably hard to write for a clever character. Writing tricks seem to be the only way to make things semi-work, and that is good enough - common sense and basic science be damned.

""Why are the rats above ground?"" Hmmmmm, that's strange. Its too bad that I'm not curious enough to look down one of the 'manholes' in the road to find out. Plus, if I was an English warrior bishop or king who knew about the ancient Roman aqueducts beneath York like Ivar does - I might not shrug this extremely unusual thing off so easily. (Also check out Sasha's critical review where this disappointing aspect gets nailed again. Here's the link, its too hysterical to miss, ha!) https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KJ32QG08TNLC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077BNGMZ1

~~~~~~~~~ #4 ~~~~~~~~~~
Farewell to a character that really grew on me, Prince/King Aethelwulf - whose last hurrah involved looking like a deer caught in headlights at one of Ivar's unbelievable stunts (the bottleneck bs where basic science gets shrugged off) - unable to react, as if he had never fought with or among Vikings before, and was new to them. (And, the actor behind Aethelwulf, Moe Dunford, is the ONLY VIKINGS ACTOR who has won an award for his work on THIS show. His character deserved better from it.)

~~~~~~~~~ #5 ~~~~~~~~~~
This writing dysfunction would not exist IF Mr. Hirst had given Lagertha a good reason to kill Aslaug last season - such as Aslaug attempting to have Bjorn killed in favor of her own sons to be Ragnar's main heirs. (I personally would have loved to see mama bear come out and rip her apart.) But nothing like that happens aside from Bjorn failing to help Aslaug rule good enough for Lagertha during Ragnar's absence, LoL!

In trailers, especially - they keep replaying the Seer saying, ""The consequences of Ragnar's death are not yet played out"" - but, this season isn't about Ragnar's death, its ALL about Lagertha's incredibly bad timing for seeking revenge against Aslaug - as if she was unable to comprehend JUST how much trouble she would rain down on Kattegat and her beloved son before she took her long overdue revenge.

And wasn't it kind of underhanded of her to wait until both Ragnar and Bjorn had left Kattegat? Did she expect Ragnar to return and THANK her for killing the mother of his sons? Perhaps she expected Ragnar to protect her from them - instead of putting him in a VERY difficult position. Lucky him, he didn't have to deal with it. Bjorn does. (And why didn't Ivar get mad at Ubbe & Sigurd for FAILING to protect Aslaug after the big deal they made about not going with Ragnar for that reason? Hedeby is DAYS away from Kattegat - why would they go? Hell, it would have been better to send the boys on the raids for a few more bonding scenes - and skip all that bs with Margrethe.)

I'm sorry, but breathtakingly beautiful, submissive nympho-slaves captivating the dark hearts of royal men - is yet another cliche that has been SO overdone on this show. Even Ivar gets his heart slashed by a mysterious slavegirl in York. GODS!! (see also #12)

This season, Lagertha proudly proclaims things like 'I am the rightful Queen' because 'her husband' ruled Kattegat - while conveniently forgetting that Ragnar was her EX-husband by HER choice. If she wasn't so puffed up about being Queen, one might think that she killed Aslaug to regain her position as Ragnar's wife instead of the crown. (Can you undivorce someone by killing their spouse? LoL!)

But more than all that... the tender moment with Aslaug in season 2, when Lagertha forgave her before returning to her abusive husband - apparently didn't really happen. Just about every woman watching that original scene was going, WTF?! Lagertha should have stayed in Kattegat and killed Aslaug right after Ubbe or Hvitserk was born - or soon thereafter, to raise them herself - if she was ever going to take any revenge.

As it was, we women could accept that Lagertha might sacrifice her much-deserved revenge for her baby boy to grow up in peace with his little brothers - until they become adults and are capable of killing each other?! How much sense does that make?

Yeah, I really hate the way Michael Hirst has made me despise Lagertha, now. She has been one of my favorite characters from the start, of course.

~~~~~~~~~ #6 ~~~~~~~~~~
Ubbe & Ivar fell out in England for a reason that they never mention again, after it happens. That reason, along with Ivar holding Ubbe more responsible for their mother's death - would give Ivar valid basis to insist that he should be the leader of the great army...

But, Ivar is supposedly angry with Ubbe for not wanting to take revenge against Lagertha on their mother's behalf - despite the fact that Ubbe was the ONLY OTHER BROTHER who cared, or attempted revenge for his mother. Neither Hvitserk nor Sigurd could have cared less.

If you ask me, they were too conveniently uninterested - but that was useful for fake-hyping conflicts. Aslaug was not such a constant bad mother to her middle sons that she would not have been respected or loved by them. What kinds of dumb, selfish things has your mother ever done - and you still love her, right? Parent/child love exists whether we want it to, or not. All the brothers should have been as mad as Ivar - maybe not as sad, but at least as mad. Lagertha asserted her authority into their lives by executing their mother - and they are not angry?! I know, old news...

~~~~~~~~~ #7 ~~~~~~~~~~
Margrethe suddenly has visions this season since Floki and Aslaug no longer live at Kattegat. That little slave has become so useful!

~~~~~~~~~ #8 ~~~~~~~~~~
A little boy witnesses a big rape and seemingly runs off to tell someone - and is never seen or talked about again. But gosh, it sure made fans wonder (and argue about) whom he had told...

~~~~~~~~~ #9 ~~~~~~~~~~
My personal pet peeve with this man-soap-opera is blown to extremes when Astrid gets gang raped (and jeez, what MH does to her because of it is more shock jock bs)... but its okay because we women got a preliminary equal-opportunity rape before that happened when Lagertha raped King Harald for having the nerve to negotiate an alliance that included a proposal of marriage to her. Plus, let's not forget another token-scene, the graphic castration scene, ha! Lagertha has always been in danger of being raped since season one. I think it must be one of Michael Hirst's favorite topics about women (see also #12).

Every significant girl born on this show has been killed off - remember Ragnar's daughter Gyda, Floki's daughter Angrboda, or Bjorn's daughter Siggy? Who wants to get to know a Viking female for any other reason than rough sex? (Its not like he has been very nice with his non-Viking female characters, either - Queen Kwenthrith's sexual 'dysfunctions' are another overdone cliche across the board in Hollywood. And, you wouldn't be able to convince me that Lagertha got a bi/lesbian lover to stimulate diversity or a lesbian audience, LoL!)

~~~~~~~~~ #10 ~~~~~~~~~~
Ivar is at least a few months younger than Gunther, Torvi's son with Jarl Borg - but, they have him aged as a CHILD at the end of last season, while Ivar goes off to raid as a young man. They do make Gunther's character bigger throughout the first part of the season, cuz - someone else 'semi-significant' who wasn't a main character needed to die. (I will also add that the scene with Torvi giggling at Gunther while training with him was adorable - and didn't that manipulate our hearts to mourn for him, all the more? Yet another writing trick.)

~~~~~~~~~ #11 ~~~~~~~~~~
Ubbe and Torvi's romance should not be happening due to their ages. Its not like they met as adults with that age difference. Its creepy. Torvi would have first encountered Ubbe in Kattegat at the age of four or five-ish when she was the very pregnant wife of Jarl Borg, shortly before he was blood eagled. Plus, Ubbe was still a child when Bjorn brought her to Kattegat. The little brothers would have grown up with Torvi's son after Paris; and, Ubbe is the uncle of her younger children with Bjorn. They are FAMILY, not lovers. (Then again, maybe MH is shooting for yet another favorite male-porn fantasy: older woman/teacher/aunt/MILF, etc - since they work so well for him. Biggest cringe-worthy line, something like, ""wishing it was you having my baby"".)

~~~~~~~~~ #12 ~~~~~~~~~~
Halfdan indebts himself to Bjorn after Bjorn saved his life in the desert. Apparently, he swore feudalty to him. (Note that Bjorn also saved his own life at the same time; and he probably would not have survived without Halfdan's help, either.) This is after we spent the past two seasons witnessing the closeness of Harald and Halfdan. They live to fight; and Harald has always provided every opportunity. Harald was also the one who brought them both to Paris and the Mediterranean; AND those two boys have no-doubt saved each others life on several occasions. We even hear Halfdan yell at Bjorn about 'Rollo betraying his own brother'; and later he tells Harald that he will always be watching his brother's back - when he splits with him to go with Bjorn. Halfdan says he is a simple man with no ambitions but to see the world... and yet, he betrays Harald and fights with Bjorn, declaring over & over again, ""He saved my life!"" (And, why did the Mediterranean princess want Bjorn and Halfdan dead, anyway? There was no explanation - but Halfdan did need a setup for his big scene, ha!)

And wasn't Halfdan's enlightenment - including 'what Bjorn taught him' awfully New Agey - kind of like it belongs in our time instead of his. I didn't believe any of it, not even his desert visions. And don't get me started on his death where they don't even fight. Halfdan just stands there and lets Harald whack at his neck. Stupid.

Some main characters needed to die - and this is an emotional Viking cliche Michael Hirst can rely on to always work: King Horik's brother betrayed his father, Jarl Borg's brother betrayed him, the brothers are betraying each other, and Rollo betrayed Ragnar twice, going on three times, now...

It is the same with the subject of rape. Vikings makes it all something to glorify & admire. Overdone cliches are inane, even Viking ones.

There were real life exceptions (even for being raped - it wasn't mandatory for women), the most notable being King Halfdan's brother [probably] taking over as Regent for his 10 year old nephew, Harald, after his father died. (Viking's King Finehair is semi-based on King Fairhair - Norway's first King.) Yeah, King Harald eventually took over the reigns of his kingdom from someone who Michael Hirst would no-doubt write as a betrayer - cuz that is the only way any story about Viking brothers could possibly go. Unimaginative.

~~~~~~~~~ #13 ~~~~~~~~~~
The end of episode ten does set things up to bring Rollo back into the picture. We all love Rollo and have missed him, that much is true! However, he is an old man now. And, despite that we took the time to get to know how King Ecbert's English Kingdom developed in great detail; and also quite a bit about the French Court... We don't ever hear anything about Rollo's court or how his kingdom, NORMANDY, developed. Isn't this show called, the VIKINGS?!

All during the time that Ragnar was gone could have been about Rollo's development as a French ruler - it could have been its own season; and Ragnar/Travis could still be coming back next year! We could have been watching the people of Kattegat speckled in, wondering and struggling to get along without him, instead of instant years gone by. IN FACT, this would have been a good spot to insert a believable power struggle between Lagertha and Aslaug if there had to be one - WHILE Ragnar's presence & crown were in question. What a stupid development and huge disappointment - rush, rush, rush.

~~~~~~~~~ #14 ~~~~~~~~~~
Not only that, but Rollo's excuse to arrive at this time is another lame writing trick. (We learned about it in an interview with Clive Standen). Michael Hirst apparently thinks he's being clever, LoL!

~~~~~~~~~ #15 ~~~~~~~~~~
I almost forgot about the adventure Floki is on - almost everyone does. (Helga's death was as unbelievable as so much of this stuff is. She suddenly just HAD to go raiding with Floki because 'we are a family'.) Floki is the only character that we are familiar with in his current storyline, so it is almost impossible to become fascinated with it. When & where did Floki learn meditation - and why is he suddenly not interested in killing Christians? Shouldn't Helga's death make him more interested in killing them now - since their treachery is his reason for being in England? His entire spiritual identity surrounding his beloved gods has been altered - and yet, he is as obsessed as ever with them. This is another part of the storyline that seems awfully New Agey, as if it belongs in our time and not his.

~~~~~~~~~ #16 ~~~~~~~~~~
Ragnar's big successes, with the exception of his first few attempts at going West - are all actually failures. They barely won Paris the first time with heavy casualties; and the second time was a more devastating loss - brave warriors either died or suffered a shoulder injury, LoL! And, King Ecbert destroyed the farming settlement while at the same time Ragnar's forces won Mercia for him... Floki was right, all those warriors died in vain. That was where we lost Torstein - another favorite secondary character among fans.

...And finally, King Ecbert gave Ragnar's avenging sons land that wasn't legally his to give - ensuring a 'nice death' for himself while robbing the brothers of the satisfaction of blood-eagling his dastardly butt!

Ragnar and the Vikings helped MAKE Ecbert England's 'King of Kings' - and yet, he betrayed them at every turn. That is probably why Ragnar instructed Ivar to make sure to take revenge against Ecbert, not just King Aella; AND it is why he told him to be RUTHLESS. No more Mr. Nice Guy, LoL!

Floki finally gets his way and he LEAVES? I'm sorry, his current storyline belongs in a future season, if it had to happen. Since Ragnar was gone early, Floki could have brought validation to all the brothers by becoming their mentor, or something. It was unnecessary to use Floki like that so Ivar would cry - in order to convince us that Ivar actually has a heart. Also in history, Ivar seems to get along with his brothers - they all end up with crowns either in Sweden, England or Ireland - even Sigurd who is already dead. (Wasn't the original vision for this series to be about Ragnar and his sons - ALL of them?)

Floki and Ivar, along with everyone else, should be VERY angry and trying to wipe the country of England from the face of the earth. Even Lagertha should be angrier since she established the settlement AND had an affair with yet-another-betrayer, King Ecbert, while she was there.

But no, Kattegat has to have a lame, overly-dramatized civil war, first...

I'll have to watch at least the next 'first episode' before I completely give up on it - plus, I actually have a fleck of interest in both King Harald and King Alfred's storylines. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm actually hoping for an unlikely scene where someone wakes up from an awful dream so the real show can begin.",1526860800,7,21256,4.671837389676384
