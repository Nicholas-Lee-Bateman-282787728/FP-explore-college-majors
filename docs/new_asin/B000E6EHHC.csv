The one star is for the seller's prompt return although it's a humbug for me!",1526688000,,248,4.975609756097561

8106401,4,B000E6EHHC,"I was surprised to see this retail so cheap.. about a third or less of what comparable drama's sell for.  And this is consistent across all sellers.  This is the YA release so it is not pirated cheap quailty but it is a ""quality product"".  I held off on my review till i watched the drama to confirm it's ""like new"" status.  I found that everything was flawless till the last cd.  The last CD had ~5 seconds of no sound (dead audio but vid was fine) and ~1 second of pixelation.  I wonder if this was  a manufacturing flaw as in my estimation this drama is way under priced.  I'm keeping the product despite it not quite living up to the ""like new"" description.  The box itself was in flawless condition.. all the cd's like new except the last one had some smudges.  I wonder if the smudge caused the pixelation and sound problem?  I think it is still a good value and worth every penny.
The drama itself is hard to judge as i am a #1 fan of Choi Ji Woo.  She's priceless.  A national treasure of S. Korea, and more significantly a national treasure of the world!  Ms Choi should have her own registration number as a world treasure!  Mr Duke, Truth/Honesty, Winter Sonata, Stairway to Heaven, Beautiful Days..  Timeless classics. (Subtitled S. Korean Drama's).  Any of her work is worth watching tho.  Please Ms Woo.. churn out some more drama's!  Ms Woo is tricked by her father into returning to Korea so she can be married and produce her grandfather an heir for his conglomerate.  She enlists the help of a water delivery guy to get dad off her back.. and then everything goes crazy..  I enjoyed it very much.  4 stars instead of 6 only because it was not as perfect, condition wise, as it could have been if it was ""like new"".",1402876800,,1732,4.363636363636363
