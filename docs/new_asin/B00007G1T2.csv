7976296,1,B00007G1T2,"When I saw that they had made WILD ARMS (A semi-secessful PSII game) into an Anime, I was skeptical but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and Rented. If anything, as far as Wild Arms' goes, its plot is anything but original and isn't even the slightest bit interesting. The basics is that a 25 year-old gunslinger, Sheyenne Rainstorm (the last remnants of a dead civilization called the evil race) supposedly ""dies"" in a gun fight and is reborn so to speak in a ""5"" year old boy's body (aka Dragon Ball GT with a twist). He wields a would-be powerful weapon called ARMS, a rare weapon that can only be fired by him for reasons fully unknown.

Thus he embarks on a quest to find his original body with an overly large man by the name of Kiel accompanied by a small blue rodent creature, named Isaac. Basically the episodes boil down to Sheyenne and co. hunting down bodies he hopes are his on leads and legends they hear about, while fending off a bunch of money grabbing women thieves (that happen to have a small pink rodent), and other obstacles. Nothing really exciting or interesting happens in this series.

Which brings me to the important part of my review: ""WILD ARMS"" despite its poor drawn cartoonish characters is not a show for children nor teenagers ranging from the ages 10-16. The show contains sexuality, mild-nudity and Homosexual* content: that is pretty much Wild arms' downfall. The voice acting on both accounts (dub and sub) is lacking in talent and serious emotion ranges, although many of your will disagree with me. And much like a ADV trademark, the special features are limited and contain concept art and trailers of other anime under ADV's name. I do not regret to say that I cannot recommend this series to anyone. Try your luck with Outlaw Star* or Trigun.",1116288000,,1797,4.6125
7976297,3,B00007G1T2,"This series dumps the viewer right in the middle of the action with Prison Warden Kihano torturing Dr. Kiel Aronax for information (it's not quite clear what information, though).  Then, in short order, a three woman team (well, one woman, one vampire, and a lady rat...) to steal a treasure rumored to be hidden in the prison's vault.  The lady is Loretta Oratorio, a card wizard.  The good doctor used the confusion to escape, he teams up with Loretta, and in short order they break into the vault only to discover that the 'treasure' is an eleven-year-old kid named Sheyenne Rainstorm.  then the action really starts to pick up...
This series is based on an old RPG series created for the Sony Playstation, which was direct competition for the Final Fantasy series.  These had an Americanized 'Western' style that was enjoying popularity in Japan at that time.  Like the final fantasy series, Wild Arms had little continuity between the games.  Thus, the anime series is more related in spirit than it is by any character continuity.  In keeping with a series based on console games, the action is frantic and the dialogue a bit sparse.
I found the DVD vaguely unsatisfactory.  The illustration and animation are old-fashioned, Saturday morning cartoonish.  Dialog is mostly banter, and plot definitely takes second play to action.  The only really original idea is that of having the star be an 11-year-old reincarnated gunman.  I prefer my anime, and my games, to be a bit slower paced with solider character development.  I'm probably not in the majority, though.  You will have to decide for yourself, but I would consider this series a rent rather than a buy product.",1073606400,,1675,4.8936170212765955
7976298,3,B00007G1T2,"I admit that i've come into this series being a fan of the Video games.
But I've seen alot of Anime, and overrall this anime is just advarage at best...  I honestly don't care for the story, I felt that somethings were never explained.  I don't care for the characters, many seem like just rips from another anime.  The voices where done alright I'll give it that.
The storys that have come around though Have not really been that interesting, and there endings have always seemed rushed.
I'm sorry to say there just isn't anything special about this Anime.
But I guess it is worth checking out...  But don't expect anything great... If your not expecting anything great you might.... just actually like it.
Myself on the other hand, I don't Hate it that's for sure...  And I can't say I actually like it.....
seeing as these are the first 5? Episodes... I can only hope this series GETS MUCH MUCH MUCH better... I'll keep on buying them though just cause i'm a fan of the games and you can never judge an anime within it's first few episodes.",1048032000,,1043,4.497354497354498
7976299,5,B00007G1T2,"As expected with all quality japanese cartoons, wild arms has nearly seamless artwork and incredible visualizations.  In addition, the storyline is captivating from the first minute, with a fairly straight forward plot that is still interesting enough with pits, turns and twists to make the video fun to watch all at once or bit by bit.  I have enjoyed watching it at least 5 times and still I enjoy every frame.",1043107200,2,413,4.802816901408451
