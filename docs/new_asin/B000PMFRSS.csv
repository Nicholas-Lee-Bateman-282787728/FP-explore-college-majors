2825411,5,B000PMFRSS,I was pleased that I could purchase these Inspector cartoons separate. These are my husbands favorite as a child and he was thrilled to get this for Christmas. I have enjoyed watching them myself.,1231718400,,196,4.794117647058823
2825412,5,B000PMFRSS,Hadn't seen these cartoons in years.  Remember them from when I was a kid. *****!,1229212800,,81,4.4
2825413,5,B000PMFRSS,"For fans of The Pink Panther Show who were disappointed that cartoons of spin-off character The Inspector were not included in the 5-disc<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pink-Panther-Classic-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B0009S4J2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection</a>, MGM/Fox Home Entertainment offers The Pink Panther and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection, Volume 6 - The Inspector! Featuring animation by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, theme music (""A Shot in the Dark"") by Henry Mancini, music score by William Lava and Walter Greene, and the voice talents of Pat Harrington Jr. (as the Inspector and Sgt. Deux Deux), Paul Frees, Larry Storch and June Foray, The Inspector is anything but clueless when it comes to providing laugh-out-loud fun and humor Friz Freleng style. This single-disc (119 min.) set features 17 [of 34] episodes from the series; Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; English mono audio; Closed Caption; English, French and Spanish subtitles; a play all feature and episode & language selection. Considering the age of the shorts, the picture and sound are fairly good, rivaling the transfers on The Pink Panther 5-disc set, minus the extras.",1228694400,3,1220,6.182352941176471
2825414,5,B000PMFRSS,"The 17 shorts on this disc are only half of the Inspector shorts produced by DFE.  A boxset containing the entire run of the Pink Panther shorts, the Ant and the Aardvark shorts, two discs of Inspector shorts (this one and presumably one with the other 17 shorts) and the Roland and Ratfink shorts has been announced both as part of a larger set which will include most of the Peter Sellers PP films and the animated shorts and as a set featuring only the animated shorts I've listed above.

I very much hope that they'll release the second Inspector disc and the Roland and Ratfink disc as individual discs, because I have all the others and can't afford to buy the whole set just for the two DVDs I don't have.

For anyone who doesn't have the other DVDs, the set does look like a very good release if you're interested in the DePatie-Freleng shorts.  If all you want are the Inspector shorts, then this particular DVD is well worth getting and hopefully the second disc of Inspector shorts will also be a stand-alone release.",1227484800,5,1028,4.510752688172043
2825415,4,B000PMFRSS,"This DVD is worth every penny I paid for it. Really, I'd pay twice that amount, considering how much enjoyment my children have gotten out of it. They watch it over and over, until I make them turn it off anyway. They giggle hysterically the whole time, and then walk around for the next few days acting out their favorite parts (thankfully not in a way anyone gets hurt) and quoting others. They've picked up on the ""say oui, not si"" joke and run with it. (7 year old asks 4 year old ""did you see that part in Star Wars where..."". 4 year old answers, ""say oui, not si"". Both fall over laughing.)

I suppose it might annoy someone else, but I grew up watching ""The Inspector"", and it was one of favorite cartoons. It's not quite as hilarious to me now, or I would have given it 5 stars. But it's still a great show, that your kids will love.",1222732800,6,841,4.191358024691358
2825416,5,B000PMFRSS,"I remember this from the Pink Panther show and between it and the Aardvark (which I also own) I am very satisfied.
I love his side-kick Spanish friend whom he's always trying to get to speak French.  These cartoons are very funny and not too violent.",1215907200,,250,4.434782608695652
2825417,5,B000PMFRSS,This DVD is awesome! I've been waiting for the Inspector cartoons to come out ever since the release of the complete Pink Panther cartoons. I have the Ant and the Aardvark DVD too. I hope they continue to release the other cartoons that were shown with the Pink Panther like the Tijuana Toads and the Shark ones. The Inspector cartoons are just like I remember them and just as funny today as they were 25 years ago. Keep 'em coming!,1213660800,,433,4.425
2825418,5,B000PMFRSS,This is an amazing collection. What I don't understand is why The Inspector wasn't introduced the DVD world first. It is THAT amazing. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have and will continue to do thanks to this new DVD collection. :D,1211673600,,236,4.266666666666667
2825419,5,B000PMFRSS,"If you're looking for a nostalgic look backwards, the Inspector compliation DVD is definately one to bring back memories. All of the Inspector cartoons from the original Pink panther Show have been compiled onto one DVD.The inspiration for Blake Edwards Clusou character, the Inspector carries all the bumbling trade marks apparrent in Peter Sellers real life adapation. Definately one to bring back memories of early 70's, Saturday afternoon television.",1210982400,,454,5.594202898550725
2825420,4,B000PMFRSS,"Pat Harrington (Emmy winner from playing Dwayne Schneider) in the seventies classic series, ""One Day At a Time,"" voiced the French Inspector  in the seventeen short cartoons here. I didn't know what I was picking up when I got this DVD. I just enjoyed watching it on the computer. The DVD is about two hours long.

The French Inspector is quite an affable character based on Peter Sellers' popular character in ""The Pink Panther"" movies. No, we don't see the Pink Panther in any of the shorts but he is on cover of the DVD case.

The cartoon shorts include ""The Great Degaulle Stone Operation"" from December 21, 1965; """"Reaux, Reaux, Reaux Your Boat"" from February 1, 1966; ""Napoleon Blown-Aparte"" from February 2, 1966; ""Cirrhosis of the Louvre"" from March 9, 1966; ""Plastered in Paris"" from April 5, 1966; ""Cock-A-Doodle Deux Deux"" from June 15, 1966; ""Ape Suzette"" from June 24, 1966; ""The Pique Poquette of Paris"" from 1966; ""Sicque! Sicque! Sique!"" from September 23, 1966; ""That's No Lady- That's Notre Dame"" from October 26, 1966; ""Unsafe and Seine"" from November 9, 1966; ""Toulouse La Trick"" from December 30, 1966; ""Sacre Bleu Cross"" from February 1, 1967; ""Le Quiet Squad"" from May 1967; ""Bomb Voyage"" from May 22, 1967; ""Le Pig: Al Aptrol"" from May 24, 1967; and ""Le Bowser Bagger"" from May 30, 1967.",1456617600,,1311,4.817777777777778

2825422,5,B000PMFRSS,"I had most of the French Inspector cartons on  VSH Tape since 1986, but they switched to DVD and they don't make VCRs anymore and the video tape itself simply oxidized, so I reluctantly had to discard them. I'm glad they decided to upgrade the and switch to a new DVD format. I still think they are funny and enjoy watching this ""Bumbling oaf "" catch the assorted nuts. I hope they will release the remaining set if any soon.",1454544000,,425,4.3125

Funny .Artistry and imagination involved in every facet, starting with the cartoon titles,  the dialogue, the accents,the stories, the makeup of the characters, the artwork, the music, the sound effects.

2825436,4,B000PMFRSS,"A great DVD for laughter!  But, I wish there were more cartoons of THE INSPECTOR.  That's why I gave this DVD 4 stars.  I saw cartoons of THE INSPECTOR (that I don't have on DVD) on YOUTUBE about a year ago, but it got erased due to copyright infringement.  How about selling a DVD of THE INSPECTOR, PART 2?  I like the cartoon when THE INSPECTOR went after two-faced Harry, and he got a little help near the end of the cartoon.  I also like the cartoon when THE INSPECTOR went after a couple on the run from the law.  The couple thought they were going to jail, but it turns out that the husband had to report to jury duty.  Otherwise, I like this DVD because it makes me laugh!  THANKS!",1399939200,,688,4.151515151515151

2825438,5,B000PMFRSS,"This character was part of the Saturday morning ""Pink Panther Show"" and was a blast to watch. The Inspector and his sidekick Sgt. Judu, solved -or stumbled onto any number of cases to catch some rather odd criminals. Although the Inspector may have solved his cases, sometimes things didn't work out as well as he thought from time to time, much like the counterpart from the movies upon which he was based. I only wish I could have gotten the complete set as this volume had only half of his series.",1391904000,2,500,4.5054945054945055
2825439,5,B000PMFRSS,"This compilation of shorts covers the years 1965-1967. The Inspector is a busy crime solver who can't seem to avert disaster; he's the main character in the Pink Panther movies. Yes, there are guns, explosives, and other forms of violence in these shorts, but keep in mind that this series debuted in the 1960s, when this sort of thing wasn't much of an issue in cartoons. Furthermore, it's fairly safe to say that this cartoon won't appeal to the very young, as the more mature plots are more geared towards an audience that's slightly older. For nostalgia's sake, this collection is a must-have. I really appreciate these shorts, their themes, and overall humor. This DVD is definitely a change of pace, and refreshing. If you're looking for the last 17 episodes (volume 7), then you will have to purchase the 9 DVD anthology available on Amazon. Perhaps they wanted to make volume 7 part of the big anthology, due to poor sales of volume 6 as a stand-alone DVD? Who knows...",1390867200,,977,4.719298245614035

So, to get the tradition going for them, I got this for a Christmas present. It was just wonderful. On time delivery and all my gifts I purchased from Amazon were in perfect condition. I can depend on Amazon for accurate information before the purchase and service after the sale, unlike other online sales companies. Even when the delivery is from another vendor, I can rest assured the product is as advertised and will be on time and perfect. I appreciate that immensely as I don't have a car and can't get out to shop unless one of my kids comes to take me.

2825456,4,B000PMFRSS,"just a bit imcomplete.  loved the inspector growing up & was thinking this was the complete set.  only reason for 4 stars is that i know it is not - i have an old vhs recording with 1 episode called ""le cop on le rocks"" and it is not in this set.  so if the set is missing one, how many more episodes are missing?

outside of that it is a great compilation if you're a fan of the pink panther classics, ant & the aardvark, et al.  would still recommend.",1318377600,,453,3.934065934065934

For me I find The inspector just as funny as when I watched the cartoon as a child.  Where is the rest of the inspector! The inspector and pink panther are my favorite cartoons besides looney tunes.  I wonder if I will have to wait 5 years or longer for the release of vol. 7?If I am not wrong there are 34 episodes all together of ""the inspector"".They give you 17 episodes  in vol. 6.

8192422,5,B000PMFRSS,"Great set. Bought these a few years ago.
NOTE: cartoons of the Pink Panther are NOT included in this set. These are videos of a companion characters (the Inspector) which was shown along with the Pink Panther back in the day when they were on TV.
That being said, these are hilarious. The Inspector is a character much like Peter Sellars' Inspector Clouseau of the Pink Panther films. He tries hard, feels he is competent, but makes hilarious goofs all around. Yet, somehow, with his faithful sidekick Sargeant Deux Deux, the bad guy still gets caught in the end.
Billed as a complete set, l am not sure this is accurate. Thought there were more Inspector cartoons than what is in this set.
Again, have had these for a number of years and they have been well used (viewed). Quality is still great. Good fun entertainment.
If you wonder if you should get these cartoons.....in the words if Sargeant Deux Deux, ""Si, l mean Oui!"" So, YES!",1480550400,,935,4.604790419161676
