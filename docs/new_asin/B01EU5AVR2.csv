Captain Flynn and another man are following Roush since he got off the train. Charlie Chan is visiting and joins the hunt. When they find Roush he will tell no tales. [The events are described so you can't miss what's happening! The comedy is really laid on thick.] Chan tracks down the owner of the car parked by the murder scene. We see a Shakespearean actor (modeled after Boris Karloff?) Then Chan discovers a matching footprint; the murderer is at the radio station! A phone call tells who this is. Then we see two comedians do their stage act. Next we see life behind the radio microphone, where the advertiser cracks her whip and the actors jump as ordered (""trained animals who can speak"" said Hitchcock). One actress asks Mr. Brett for a better position; but he won't worry about her future.

A strange poison is used to kill Gloria Baynes. Then we see two conspirators who tell how they work (so you don't miss anything). Mr. Cooper and Mr. Brett have been watched. The head of the operation makes Mr. Brett escape for good. His body was then found in a cold testing chamber. The police arrest Cooper, and they try to contact the unknown head of the spy ring. Chan learns how Brett was killed. When Mr. Rand tries to tell Chan something he too is rendered silent! But Chan figures out how they were killed (a high-tech method). Then there is a final chase of the head of the spy ring, who is caught by the same trap used for Brett.

This must be the funniest in the series, a collection of jokes set in an espionage murder mystery. The simple settings tell of its low budget. You'll note how sometimes the actors can't prevent a smile as they speak. There is even a part where they tell of the dangers of cigarette smoking! Is there a message in the revelation of the traitor?",1477872000,4,1815,4.460843373493976
