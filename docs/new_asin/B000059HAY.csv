8455943,1,B000059HAY,"Like most biking enthusiasts, I am a huge fan of the work of a talented young chap named Luke Jolly and his 'Tiger Team'. Imagine my dissapointment then when I sat through this whole DVD and Luke did not appear once, leaving me with nothing but a rather expensive tea coaster!. Someone at the 'Gravity Games' has messed up big time and no doubt heads will roll but that is of little consolation to me. Perhaps there should have been some sort of warning on the box regarding Mr Jolly's non appearance, or were the makers of this DVD cynically attempting to cash in on Mr Jolly's popularity without having to pay him to appear?. Either way, 'The Gravity Games - Summer Two (Freestyle Motocross, Thrills and Spills, Bikes, Skateboarding)' is deducted four stars for this grave oversight, despite some good skateboarding bits.",1089417600,,823,4.7622377622377625

If your not a skater then you'll probably hate it, or you won't understand why people like it so much, but if you like skating, tihs is a must have video!",969753600,,270,3.9272727272727272
