Highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic nice love story.",1478390400,,262,4.695652173913044

8634196,4,B00HQ8Z29S,sad and great movie.  It's the prequel to the Lake house.  It's the original movie that the Lake house was based on.,1416096000,,116,4.2272727272727275
8634197,4,B00HQ8Z29S,"Originally, I had bought the Lake House movie at a store and watched it several times. Instantly I noticed that the beginning credits said it was based on a Korean movie and got around to buying this movie in Korean. I like both the remake and original. I can't say that about any other film yet. It is very much the same as Lake House but with slight differences. One difference is that instead of the main female lead being a doctor she works in voice acting for some Korean puppet show.

This page says region three now, but I'm almost certain I looked for the region when I bought it two years ago and it played fine in my non region free player, so it almost has to be region one. (And no I didn't hack it either)",1410825600,,718,4.16546762589928
8634198,5,B00HQ8Z29S,"Before I watched the movie, I thought it might be boring and too dramatic, but when I saw it at my friend's house with his recommendation, it was good! This movie has some good food-for-thoughts in several lines about cleaning the house and such. I learned some things especially how to love especially when you love someone in two different world/times. This is a good movie!",1409011200,,376,4.712121212121212
8634199,5,B00HQ8Z29S,"Charming movie. English sub-titles.  It was fun comparing/contrasting it  to it's re-make, The Lake House.  Both are good, in their own way; I can't say which one I liked better, but The Lake House is more romantic.",1356220800,2,215,4.756756756756757
8634200,4,B00HQ8Z29S,"I bought this because I was a fan of the 2006 American remake, The Lake House. I was pleasantly surprised because this is a better and more romantic film.

The basic plot involves a man and a woman who live in the same house, two years apart, who are somehow able to communicate across time via notes left in the mailbox. What begins as a purely business correspondence (about forwarding mail, boxes left in attic, etc.) evolves into a deepening friendship, and they try to arrange to meet, but it never quite works out. Then the woman (who is living in the present) finds out the man (who is living in the past) has been killed in an accident, and tries to prevent it. Will he get the message in time? And if he does, will he still remember her?

In Korean with English/Korean subtitles. The extras disk is unfortunately not subtitled, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1339286400,5,881,4.398773006134969
8634201,5,B00HQ8Z29S,"""Everyone I loved were always just out of reach."" -- Sung-hyun writing to Eun-joo

An achingly beautiful film, its bittersweet tale of love and longing for a happiness perhaps forever out of reach, Il Mare epitomizes why so many are flocking to Korean cinema. Joining films like A Moment to Remember and Ditto of recent times to form a unique genre, filled with a tenderness and beauty heretofore only found in books, Il Mare leaves an impression of images and emotions deeply entwined around our hearts, like flowered vines clinging to a trellis. Once viewed, there is no turning back for the film lover, who will spend much time and energy tracking down the romanticist films of Korea. A lovely and haunting score interspersed with some beautiful jazz selections help create a moving letter of ethereal beauty, as love crosses time only to be kept at arm's length by a gulf too deep to bridge.

Titled in lovely Italian for North American audiences, the original Korean title is based on Chinese characters, meaning time-transcending love. The Sea House and Siworae both hold great meaning for all who have seen this delicately layered love story that squeezes the heart until breath comes grudgingly. Directed with great patience by Lee Hyun-seun and photographed with an eye to elegant simplicity by cinematographer Hong Gyeong-pyo, a quiet and magical mood which never wavers is set for lovely Jun Ji-hyun of My Sassy Girl fame, and Lee Jung-jae. A mailbox outside a lonely house at the end of a pier becomes a portal through which Eun-joo (Jun Ji-hyun) and Sung-hyun (Lee Jung-jae) correspond through time itself. Leaving a Christmas card in her Il Mare mailbox, dated Dec 21, 1999, she requests the next resident forward her mail. That simple act will bring her into contact with a puzzled Sung-hyun, who receives the query, but two years earlier, in December of 1997. What follows is a graceful story of love slowly healing wounds and blooming across the gulf of time.

Eun-joo is very much alone at Christmas and experiencing the pain of love lost when the rift opens and her first letter arrives from Sung-hyun, who thinks a joke is being played. As in Ditto, small things she knows about the past convince both they've actually found some sort of wrinkle in time. There is joy and laughter when they realize it is the mailbox at Il Mare bringing them together. He retrieves a tape player for her, small presents are exchanged, and a date of sorts is arranged, as each does what is suggested by the other, but two years apart. Red gloves she looked at but did not buy, a bottle of wine he leaves her for their date across time, a dog named cola, and a tree he decorated at Il Mare she enjoyed two years into the future offer very special moments for the couple and the viewer. Eun-joo consoles Sung-hyun when his father dies, and sends him a gift to help him heal. Director Lee Hyun-seun makes marvelous use of a bench at a train station where the two often meet, separated by time, and the train which takes her away, to create an atmosphere of longing for what should be but perhaps is not meant to be.

An attempt to actually meet doesn't work, and when she asks Sung-hyun for his help to keep from losing someone, he knows she is the love of his life. A moment of revelation has her racing with desperate urgency to the mailbox to prevent a heartbreaking tragedy. Moving and beautiful, Il Mare will capture your heart and reside there always after seeing it for the first time. Remade in America as The Lake House, the Korean version is a lovely film of poetic beauty. Listings for this film are very murky, so make sure you are getting the original Korean language version, with English subtitles as an option. Those with a romantic heart are urged to see Il Mare, and begin their journey into the world of Korean romanticist cinema.",1278720000,14,3848,4.679468242245199
