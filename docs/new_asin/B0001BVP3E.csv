1986616,5,B0001BVP3E,"I got the Ranier Training DVD and it met all of my expectations.  It defines a highly sophisticated 6 month program utilizing the latest concepts in developing fitness.  The parts of the video showing some sport specific, but not common known exercises are particularly valuable.
I also really like the fact that there was a link to a webpage that listed the entire 6 month training program so I didn't have to try to write it all down.",1076198400,7,436,4.576923076923077
1986617,3,B0001BVP3E,"I am a middle aged desk jockey who attempts to work out at least five times each week.  My goal with these workouts is to increase my fitness level so that hiking trips are more enjoyable.  I had been searching for a hiking specific exercise program for years, or even a trainer at the gym to which I belong who had a serious comprehension of what I needed to do to be able to routinely cover 20 miles each day on the Appalachian Trail.
The Train To Climb Mt Rainier DVD gives me this resource and much more.  Not only does it lay out the exercise program, both cardio and weight training, that is needed, and not only does it take you from a beginning level forward, but it is excellently illustrated.  I am now in the second month of the program and highly recommend it.  The price is small considering the relative amounts hikers routinely pay to lighten their load through newer, more advanced gear.  Train the engine that carries that lighter load and it will be even lighter, or at least feel that way.
Most impressive of all was the ability to communicate with the folks who put this product out.  I had questions on certain aspects and was answered quickly and thoroughly.  The one area that I would like to see improved is an explanation of what one should do after completing the six month program.  I obtained the answer by asking the question, but the regimen would be that much more valuable if it included a segment on maintenance as well.
This might not be for all hikers.  If you want to be winded easily and rapidly, cherish the thougths of being stiff and sore, have no desire to move at your own pace, and prefer to have to stop to gasp for air every few steps then you should save your money.  But if you want to set up a plan to milk more enjoyment out of your trips, throw down the plastic and spend the equivalent of a couple of pair of socks.",1075680000,23,1866,4.318051575931232
8009852,5,B0001BVP3E,"This no frills video has fantastic information for training to climb high peaks.  What I especially appreciate are the clips showing exercises that can be done with items found around the house.  This comprehensive, straightforward plan includes specific recommendations for exercises/number of reps/etc. each week of the program.  I will recommend this video to all of my friends who want to get in shape (as I am doing) for Mt. Rainier or any other high peak.  Thank you Courtenay and Doug for this great video.",1277510400,4,513,5.0
8009853,5,B0001BVP3E,"I have signed on with RMI for a Rainier climb, and their advise is to arrive ""in the best shape of your life"". Well how exactly does one get there? I picked up the DVD ""Alpine Mountaineering on Mt Rainier"" which shows legends Whittaker, Viesturs, and Hahn in action, but doesn't tell how they got to be in such great shape. (hint: daily training and decades of hard work) So how does a couch-potato go from slug to superman in 6 months? By getting this DVD and following it religiously. Not only does it start you off with the basics, you get step-by-step instructions on how to properly perform the exercises. You get training schedules and downloadable (from the website) charts for a month-to-month exercise regimen. It is precise and concise and tailored specifically for a Mt Rainier climb. I had a question about something specific to my training, and when I emailed the authors, Courtenay answered my question! Bodyresults also offers personalized training and advice via email and their website. All-in-all, Courtenay and Doug put out a great DVD and their sole purpose is to help you succeed. You can't go wrong if you buy this one. I have referred back to it quite a few times and I am now in month 4. I can truly say, I am well on my way to ""the best shape of my life"" and I owe it to this DVD.",1269129600,8,1305,4.464435146443515
8009854,4,B0001BVP3E,"I am climbing Rainier later this year and I am using this DVD as my training regimen.  It gives a detailed 6 month plan on how to get in shape for climbing Mount Rainier.  There is a lot of great information and enough climbing specific exercises to keep from getting bored.  This DVD was also recommended by the guide service I am using, Alpine Ascents.  The production is pretty low which is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, it does not take away from the value of the information.",1266019200,6,490,4.293478260869565
8009855,5,B0001BVP3E,"It took ignoring a strength and conditioning link on the Rainier Mountain Guides' website as I began training for my climb, nine months of training with a great trainer, who had never climbed a mountain, and a training injury which put me in 16 weeks of physical therapy, to recognize the true value of ""Train to Climb Mt. Rainier or any high peak.""

Were that not enough, the climb from Paradise Point to Pebble Creek which began in steady rain at 45 degrees and ended in driving snow, 50 mph sustained winds, 25 foot visibility and a wind chill of 0 degrees, convinced me that even if the weather conditions had been favorable, I probably would not have reached the summit.
When the decision to try the climb again was made, I ordered this excellent DVD which packed more useful information into it's sixty-six minute running time than I had been able to pull from various sources in preparation for my failed attempt the summer before.

While each of the six sections has individual merit, the demonstrated climbing specific strength and the layout of the six month training program shared the information I needed to train to meet my goal of summiting Mt. Rainier in the summer of 2010.",1265673600,7,1190,4.688995215311005
8009856,2,B0001BVP3E,"I purchased the DVD, Train to Climb Mt Rainier, for my 19 year son for a Christmas gift in 2009.  Upon viewing it, he and his brothers (all older than he) were laughing so hard at the acting and portrayals of mountain climbers that they didn't learn a thing from the DVD.  The high fives were corny as well as the lessons of what not to do to train for a climb.  I believe that this purchase was a complete waste of my money and was extremely disappointed.",1264982400,2,456,4.159090909090909
8009857,4,B0001BVP3E,"There aren't too many training videos available on mountaineering. Actually this is the only one I know. Even books are rare. I really enjoyd the set of mountaineering specific gym exercises and stretches. I got new ideas for my training sessions. Also the suggested 6-month training program was very thorough and unique. Being able to do all that one must be fit enough for Mt. Rainier. I have only climbed European 4-thousand-meter peaks and 5-6 hours/wk of endurance training during the last 3 months before the trip has been enough so far (2-4 hours/wk during off season). Maybe the long summit day makes Mt. Rainier harder than e.g. Mont Blanc. I wish the DVD had included more endurance training on top of strength and flexibility training. Why they always make these documents so short? Mountaineering is a hobby of passion! I could easily watch a 20-hour training video on climbing high mountains. It's good that they left training for other climbing sports out in the document, because I think the audience is different. It shows that the video was made years ago, which isn't necessarily a flaw. Video and sound quality are good enough for the purpose, but what is more important is that the takes are long and stabile. I just hate the modern restless ""millisecond/take"" style. More videos like this, please!",1197676800,3,1318,4.914798206278027
8009858,5,B0001BVP3E,"This is a great DVD for anyone who wants to do climbing-specific training in anticipation of doing a major mountain climb - or any climb! It provides the necessary tools to create your own six month fitness rogram, with or without access to a gym, and explains how the exercises relate to specific climbing activities. I have used Body Results training to climb two major peaks, and highly suggest this DVD to others planning to do the same.",1160956800,6,441,4.666666666666667
8009859,1,B0001BVP3E,"I am planning on climbing Rainier next summer and I was intrigued by this DVD. Luckily I did not buy this. I rented it from Netflix, and even their ranking system had rated it extremely low. While I agree the stretches and workouts are beneficial, anyone with any sense, experience, and comfort in a gym will not need this product. There are plenty of free programs out there on the net, keep your money.",1157068800,7,404,4.472972972972973
8009860,5,B0001BVP3E,"I used Train to Climb Mt. Rainier to get me ready for an Aug. 2002 climb of Mt. Ranier with Shape Magazine. It was a great tool and provided me with all of the information that I needed to climb. It gave me detailed information about all aspects of building physical endurance, including stretching, aerobics, strength training (weight lifting), and anaerobic training. The program includes specific instructions on how to begin training in month one and how to continue developing strength and stamina each month until you are ready to taper your workouts before your climb. The program provided a variety of exercise choices which helped to keep my motivation from waning. Another great aspect of the program is that it provides you with a way to train at home. This is awesome when you live thirty miles from the nearest gym. I felt like I had two personal trainers which is amazing when you consider I live in a rural town of four hundred people.
I would recommend this program to anyone preparing for a big climb. On my climbing day, I felt great. All of the hard work and training was worth the effort as I sat on the top of Mt. Rainier and looked out over the horizon. There's nothing like the magical feeling of being on top of the world! I truly believe that Courtney and Doug's advice helped me reach the peak!",1080259200,2,1320,4.5738396624472575
