5554879,2,B00B4GLJWM,"SPOILER ALERT! Aah, don't bother this will put ya to snoozing'.

The premise; a party for the girl (Prepon) turning thirty by an emasculated somewhat androgynous male throwing the party is long drawn out dribble, better told in a fifteen minute short.

Perhaps, no, absolutely should have added free boob shots to liven up the flick. I have to say though the leads sister and the chemistry between the guy she left with at the end had a better storyline to follow.",1388188800,,464,4.646341463414634
5554880,2,B00B4GLJWM,"They were literally in the kitchen the ENTIRE movie. It could have worked...but it didn't. The acting from supporting actors was poor and I wanted to finish it, but it was a waste of my time. The main cast is not even bad! Idk who convinced them to do this stupid movie.",1379376000,,270,4.211538461538462

5554883,2,B00B4GLJWM,Truly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  I enjoy indie and foreign movies very much - and the lead actors in this movie.  We got about halfway through the film - and then shut it off.  Reviews from people like Dennis Bush make me wonder if the studios PR people are posting reviews.

5554886,4,B00B4GLJWM,"REally enjoyed the film. The ride we take centered around where every party ends up, the kitchen, is nothing less than entertaining. Laura Prepon is warm and delighting as is the cast that hangs out with her. Laugh out loud moments, tender moments, revelations for all ---- well worth watching with your date.",1364860800,3,309,4.849056603773585
5554887,5,B00B4GLJWM,"This was the first time I've seen Laura Prepon outside of That 70's Show, and she was great, as was the large supporting cast. Lots of funny moments mixed in with the drama of her 30th birthday. Thumbs up!",1363737600,3,205,4.282051282051282
5554888,5,B00B4GLJWM,"You will feel like a part of the ensemble cast, including a number of quirkly and sometimes, laugh-out-loud characters that may remind you of a few people you know!

I DO wish they had left out use of the tobacco drug; absolutely NO reason to have smoking in this movie! Other than that, I was surprised to see one of the sexual scenes (though nothing explicit shown, rather bold!) which was included in this type of film.

5554897,1,B00B4GLJWM,"I was looking for a ""happy-go-lucky"" movie that didn't require too much thought.  I do love Laura Prepon and Brian Greenberg, so I thought it would be entertaining.  However, the plot was inconceivable.  Too many ""cooks"" in that kitchen, for sure.  Too many characters had pointless interactions with Jennifer (the Birthday girl).  For example, the band leader with the random date, who comes back later with his whole band to start a fight with the band that was hired to play.  Also, the sister's secret pregnancy is portrayed so poorly that all women should cringe at the way she talks about getting knocked up so easily and then feels so apathetic towards it.  She is all too eager to tell everyone, even strangers,  of her pending abortion, which usually isn't openly talked about with such indifference.  Jennifer's boyfriend (Brian Greenberg) plays an absolute jerk who cheats on her with more than one of her so-called friends, who seem to have no respect for Jennifer.  If she learns anything at all from this party that she didn't want, Jennifer should wish for better friends when she blows out those 30 candles.",1474848000,,1123,4.863157894736842

5555028,3,B00B4GLJWM,"The overall feeling of the movie was that it was a snapshot of a typical night in a 20- or 30-year old's life; there were no earth-shattering revelations and few long-lasting consequences (except for one spoiler).

It was an easy, brainless movie to watch. It's a movie about a comparably chill house party (as opposed to a crazy frat party), where people are coming in and out of the kitchen all night on the way to the fridge to grab a beer. The entire movie is set in the kitchen.

Laura Prepon is the birthday girl, who just broke up with her cheating boyfriend (Bryan Greenberg) the night before her birthday.  The friend who's not-so-secretly in love with her but could be gay (Matt Bush) throws her a birthday party and is a spaz the entire night because he wants everything to be perfect. You see weird love triangles, unrequited love, the search of hookups (no nudity but one kind of explicit scene), and back-stabbing friends going after the same guy (Greenberg). The relationship between Prepon and her sister, Dreama Walker, was played really well, and was believable. Their chemistry was a big bright spot for the film. Walker's character is also going through some drama that comes up throughout the film.

It wasn't the most exciting movie but I think a lot of 20 and 30-somethings can relate to having one of those weird drunken house party nights. I watched it for Greenberg but he's not in the movie much. It centers more on Prepon and Walker.

The reviews about Prepon being warm and delightful seemed a little weird to me, since a character going through a breakup, trying to deal with the stress of her sister's situation, and a party she just isn't in the mood for isn't what I'd call a delightful situation. Still, I think she nailed her character. I also wouldn't call it a comedy, as some other reviewers did; I didn't have any laugh out loud moments. I'm not sure what genre I'd give it... it just felt relatable to me (I'm in my mid-20s) because of the relationship issues, etc.

Also, definitely agree with other reviewers who say the movie meanders and doesn't seem to have much direction. I didn't mind that, though.",1436745600,4,2146,4.63421052631579

The Birthday party is a disaster from the beginning and everyone basically keeps opening up the refrigerator, grabbing a bottle of beer, removing the cap, taking a sip or two, then puts the beer on the counter.
