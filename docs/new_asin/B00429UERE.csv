8413307,5,B00429UERE,"Film Synopsis: Sawdust in the Blood used to be a Carnie compliment...not a description of a crime scene. There are a thousand sideshows playing thousands of small towns in 1936 when the Knuckles Brothers Show rolls into yet another town, ready to delight and dazzle the town folk with amazing acts and puzzling oddities. As they set up their tents they could not know that within days several of them would be dead, ripped savagely apart by a seemingly inhuman force, their souls stolen from their limp and bloody bodies. Step up, step up, ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to begin...",1284336000,2,591,4.747572815533981
8413308,4,B00429UERE,"Carnies opens with some black and white footage and a narrative telling us about the depression and how so many people found themselves without work and that many of them joined up with traveling sideshows just to make a living. The film then shifts to color and it is 1936 in Bakersfield, California, we are following a group of Carnies as they are about to get their shows underway for those willing to come and be entertained by a variety of men and women each with different acts to perform. People always find movies about these traveling sideshows intriguing, what Carnies does is it takes that old formula and adds horror and thriller elements to it which takes the genre up to a whole new level. I loved the look, the cinematography is fantastic and the cast are all amazing plus it doesn't hurt having two legends of the genre, Reggie Bannister and Doug Jones in your movie either. The story is simple enough but with a a few nice twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing and interested. The killings in the film are not overly gory but they are effective. The film to me is more a thriller with some horror elements to it but call it what you want I will just call it amazing, the film really grabbed by attention from it's opening scenes and it kept me on edge till the shocking climax. Let me mention before I forget that the film's soundtrack which is fantastic as well and it really helps set the mood and atmosphere needed, you feel like you are at the sideshow yourself. The story is one not to spoil for those waiting to see the film so I am not going to go into great detail on what happens but I really liked the way the film-makers blended the horror elements into the thriller setting, it is not only clever but highly effective as well and it adds to the over-all creepiness of the story. Brian Corder is no stranger to cinema, he has worked in it for a number of years but Carnies is his debut as both a Writer and Director and he gets high marks from his Critic, the film made me an instant fan of his and I look forward to seeing what else Brian has up his sleeves. Carnies is fun, creepy, a bit scary and totally entertaining. I highly recommend Pre-ordering it now.",1284076800,6,2203,4.349514563106796
