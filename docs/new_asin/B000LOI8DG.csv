Highly recommended.

This video is the sequel to the popular Cool Moves 2 video. This video is packed full of moves/ routines/ demos.

They are very good value. The moves are a mix of LA, NY, Cuban steps. All the moves can be incorporated into LA or NY style. The moves produce a good flow.

The most important thing about the moves taught is that they are leadable & followerable without warning. The male can just lead a female that knows these turns without any tips or warnings.

Eric Freeman has provided a very detailed & accurate review of these videos on his site.

I would class the level as very good beginners to intermediate with some advanced . Most people would class this video as intermediate to advanced.

(Note: My grading standard is a lot higher than most as I have to provide scope for the very complex advanced moves not been taught in any video yet. By this I mean the advanced flips used in performance Salsa.)

I highly recommend these videos.",1167782400,,1042,4.476190476190476
