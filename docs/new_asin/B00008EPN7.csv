7982188,5,B00008EPN7,"Very important film from the ""So"" tour that dips back into Gabriel the artist from his key earlier 3rd and 4th albums. I was actually at Lycabettus in Athens when he was filming in 87; long story but the 3 shows were sold out. My beef with Scorsese on this is that he doesn't really document (title) all the photo shots he inserts between performances, and the camerawork on ""No Self Control"" is absolutely horrible -- it doesn't come near capturing the large view of the stage needed to appreciate Gabriel's incorporation of the light booms into his daring and original performance. Thankfully Scorsese has not to my knowledge been entrusted with any further concert filming of the artist, and perhaps it is for this reason that the product has not been reissued on DVD. That is no excuse however -- blowing an opportunity on one song takes almost nothing away from the essential nature of this film for every Gabriel fan. The movie does manage not to plunge the listener doomfully into the pop masterpiece but slight creative disappointment of 1986's ""So"" owing to the visuals that make the Gabriel stage show a must-see that compensates for some of the blandness of the So material. I love the energy of the band, that David Rhodes and Tony Levin seem choreographed by a whirling dervish, and the energy of the African performers raiding the stage for ""In Your Eyes."" A special treat is the opener ""Excellent Birds"" from his partnership with Laurie Anderson, featuring the band in a Rockettes-style swing move that hints of the theatrics and acrobatics to come, musically and in dance. -- Ouzo Jones",1356652800,,1602,4.787003610108303
7982189,4,B00008EPN7,"This is a solid concert by Gabriel, be nice to see a few more songs with only 10-11 and even better would be dvd or of course blu-ray like Secret world is coming out on.  Not sure why this has not been produced on DVD, maybe soon with the so 25 year anniversary tour this year.  Other than that, a must see for any Peter Gabriel fan.

7982190,5,B00008EPN7,"I have been a huge fan of P. Gabriel since forever.  The P.O.V. concert I think was one of his best.  He's in his prime, a great band backing him up and a few surpries sets this concert apart from the rest!

I only wish this came in DVD form.  It only comes (if you can find it) in VHS!!!",1277596800,,288,3.75
7982191,5,B00008EPN7,"Being a long time fan of Peter Gabriel (my favourite album in grade 4 was ""Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" when he was in Genesis), I found this a wonderful perspective of Gabriel's works of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. As anyone who knows Gabriel's past, his music is not always just for aural enjoyment, but for emotional qualities.
  This movie captures Gabriel in one of his quintessential performances. Right before apartheid was abolished and the world was increasing pressure on the South African Government. His musical journey, from his first albums after Genesis,to his ""breakthrough"" album Security, and his mid 80's commercial success with ""So"", passes the energy through the screen to the viewer. My only complaint is the lack of footage of his drummer Manu Katche. (It's always been one of my favourite things to see with Gabriel in concert is how Katche, with his syncopated rhythms and style, compares with Gabriel's previous drummer Phil Collins).
  During ""Lay Your Hands on me"" his pre-grunge stage-diving still brings goosebumps to my arms everytime I see this. I highly recommend this video to anyone who is interested in ""World-Beat"" music, well actually to ANYONE who is interested in music in general.
  You may not enjoy him as much as I do, but if you are not moved in anyway by ""In Your Eyes"" with the addition of Youssou N'Dour, you must be too young to remember an iconic John Cusack scene in ""Say Anything"".",1274313600,,1427,4.827868852459017
7982192,5,B00008EPN7,"Excellent video from an excellent artist.

Peter Gabriel is still one of the most innovative and generous human beings and artist. He is not just a musician, writer, he has always been a performance artist, a humanitarian, and a generally all around good guy throughout his career, and I can easily imagine his whole life.

His work bringing third world musicians into the spotlight, creating a record label just for that purpose is very admirable and commendable. His concerts usually feature more than one of them in the show as well.

This tape is from a period when he was still fresh on his own, a bit after leaving Genesis. One of the highlights is him doing 'Lay Your Hands' and body surfing the audience. I was at a concert where he did this, and it was cool to say the least. You could tell his audience wouldn't be one to try to knife him, or strangle him as he made his way around the venue.

This still isn't released on dvd, and may never be. I don't know why, it's a mystery to his fans as well, as it's a very well made video, showcasing his band and locations through Peter's POV (Point of View).

Glad I got it, now to digitize it for my library so it doesn't get lost if/when the tape gives up the ghost.",1235433600,,1222,4.318777292576419
7982193,5,B00008EPN7,"This is without a doubt my favorite Peter Gabriel concert video next to Secret World Live. I don't know what else to say beyond to see the energy and pure magic between Peter Gabriel and, a yet unknown, Yousou N Dour is amazing. In fact, he repeated this energy on Secret World Live but, I personally prefer to hear Peter and Youssou perform In Your Eyes. Now, my only request to Peter Gabriel is to please release this video on dvd.

Wait, latest news from Peter G's website is that P.O.V. is finally coming to DVD by year's end. It's apparently previewed in one of his most recent concert dvd', Still Growing Up Live and Unwrapped. So, be patient all my fellow Gabrielites. P.O.V. is coming to dvd before you can blink your eyes!",1187395200,,731,4.455223880597015
7982194,5,B00008EPN7,"I bought this mainly for the PoV vesion of Mercy Street, but I must say, I got more than I bargained for!
This DVD is jammed pack with Gabriel. From Concert performances to home videos this DVD has it all. I think this tops even ""All About US""(another excellant gabriel video). I really recommend this.
Oh, and Mercy Street is great as well!",1061251200,,341,4.428571428571429
7982195,5,B00008EPN7,"This is a magnificent film.  It captures Peter Gabriel at his best - during the SO tour.  I have been a Peter Gabriel fan for years - and his ""SO"" concert was the best live show I've ever seen.  A very young Youssou N'Dour from Senegal was on this tour (and sang on songs like ""In Your Eyes"").  The concerts were full of a remarkable energy (and the songs had such meaning - especially ones like ""Biko"" and ""Games without Frontiers"").  POV has complete versions of all of Gabriel's best songs such as ""San Jacinto"", ""Shock the Monkey"", ""Solsbury Hill"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Sledgehammer"", ""Games Without Frontiers"", ""In Your Eyes"", ""Biko"" and much more.  A true classic!",1060214400,9,666,4.698275862068965
