1907713,5,B0000AKCJP,"This movie is well worth the buy, especially if your little one is already a caillou fan.
It takes you through the 12 days preceding Christmas and all the things Caillou's family has to do to be ready in time, and includes regular events found in the run up to Christmas.
 It introduces the toddler to a vast array of concepts and illustrates Christmas around the world through the opening of each door on the advent calendar and then relates it through the activities Caillou does the following day. It is a movie worth purchasing as it stimulates language and intellect through new words and concepts and encourages an understanding of giving to others. This is a great introduction to what happens at Christmas time and seems to lessen the fears some toddlers face when it comes around...",1068508800,,791,4.731884057971015

Mine: Almost 5 stars?  Really?  There clearly are not enough SSRI's in my blood stream when I watch this.  How can you stand it?  Calliou, man.  If this kid was mine, I'd need therapy (or boxing...or possibly a drinking habit).

My toddler loves him though.  Lingers on every word.  Memorizes every song.  Excitedly calls for me to show me a scene she loves (and that's obnoxious because it takes me like 5 minutes to fit the pillowcase back over my head afterwards).

I am glad for this holiday special though; it has taught me a lot about cultural practices around the world that I couldn't retain in my Religions and Cultures coursework in college.  They ought to consider showing this film as part of the new curricula--I guarantee the information will stick.  Forever.  It will haunt nightmares.

What happened to Tom and Jerry?  Given the entertainment value for my child, I must (somewhat begrudgingly) give 4 stars.",1475712000,6,1136,4.6938775510204085

1907771,1,B0000AKCJP,"Ugh. All these positive reviews are stunning. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst holiday offerings you can expose you child to--and torture for parents.

The animation is shoddy and cheap, the script ridiculous, voice work and ""singing"" (it's a sickly-sweet ""musical,"" after all) horrendous in a nails-on-the-chalkboard way, and that brings me to the ""songs"" themselves. They represent some of the laziest songwriting I've ever heard: asinine lyrics with rage-inducing, repetitive melodies. It's musical waterboarding.

The worst moments include Caillou's dad's inane explanation for how Christmas trees came to be a tradition--a simple-minded and historically inaccurate moment of sheer stupidity--and the Christmas morning closing number, which climaxes with the characters bleating ""Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone!"" That's some creative songwriting, there. Clearly, the producers of this travesty simply ran out of ideas (and they were running on fumes from the start).

The TV program on which this is based is equally horrible and infamous for showcasing its titular protagonist's bratty behavior. Although he invariably learns a gentle ""lesson"" by the conclusion of every episode, it's kind of hard for your little one to glean much from it when 99% of the show is devoted to Caillou being a world-class little s***.

Do yourself and your child a favor, and steer clear.",1449878400,3,1440,5.561643835616438
1907772,5,B0000AKCJP,"Caillou is one show my 4 year old daughter consistently enjoys - and has for as long as I remember her watching TV.  She loves that she can watch this any time of year and pause it when she needs a break.  They do play it very often on Sprout in December and typically longer after Christmas but it's nice to have what she considers one of her favorite movies, on hand for any time watching.",1449446400,,391,4.131578947368421

Plot[edit]
It's a very special holiday for Caillou when he learns about Christmas traditions around the world and the importance of giving and sharing. When Caillou wonders just how many days there are left until Christmas, his Daddy gives him a Christmas calendar featuring holiday traditions from countries around the world in every window. Caillou also goes tobogganing, learns how to ski and plays Hanukkah games with his friend Leo. Caillou also gives away some of his toys when he learns about children around the world that are in need of toys such as his old ones he no longer plays with. Caillou's little sister Rosie also gets in on the Christmas fun. When Mom offers to help Rosie with making gifts, Rosie decides to try it on her own. The Movie Features several songs performed by the cast of the movie including ""Where Christmas is Not The Same"" and ""Eight Days to Go"" and ""Everyday"" performed by French artist Marilou.

Production[edit]
Caillou's Holiday Movie was produced at Special 1 Productions Inc. Annie Bovaird takes over as the English voice of Caillou because the previous English voice of Caillou, Jaclyn Linetsky, who played Megan in the TV show ""15/Love"", died at the age of 17 in 2003, not long before the production was released. The film was directed by Nick Rijgersberg, written by Peter Svatek and produced by Evelyn Anyosz, Andre Auger, Diane Dallaire, Natalie Dumoulin, Louis Fournier, Julie Lovelock, Lesley Taylor and Steven Valin.

Reception[edit]
The movie received deeply mixed reviews. Judge Mark Van Hook started his review on November 27, 2003 on DVD Verdict and concluded ""I can't find it in my heart to convict Caillou's Holiday Movie on any counts, as it's so inoffensive that I can't seem to find any grounds for conviction. But it's also so bland that an acquittal is equally difficult to issue, leaving me with no choice but to declare a hung jury. Fans of Caillou as well as most kids six and under will probably find enough here to enjoy, but everyone else is advised to steer clear. Case dismissed.""[2]

DVD[edit]
On October 7, 2003 (the same day the VHS tape was released), a DVD for the movie was released. The DVD contains a few special features, including:

An animated interview with Caillou.
a couple holiday songs.
The Night Before Christmas read-along.
6 Caillou challenges.
Languages: English, French or Spanish.
The film is presented in full screen and is in 2.0 Dolby Surround audio.[3]

1907803,5,B0000AKCJP,"This is the sweetest, gentlest Christmas movie ever!
The interrelationships of the family members, including the kitty, are so respectful and meaningful.
The story, itself teaches children about how different cultures celebrate their Holiday, by Caillou lifting a flap on his advent calendar, every night, with either his Mother or Father. They have a little ritual, every night, at bedtime, which is such a nice experience for any child to have.
This movie is well written; touches on many subjects, and teaches many lessons.
This animated film would be a welcome addition to any child's, and parents', film library. It is perfectly charming.",1424649600,,643,5.252427184466019

1907816,5,B0000AKCJP,"My children cannot get enough of this movie! Every year they start asking to watch it as soon as they see Christmas decorations appearing around town, and they're still asking for it by spring.  I know that a lot of parents don't like Caillou because he whines; honestly, though, I think Caillou is respectful of his elders, and the show is a good example of positive family values and showing kindness to each other. Caillou and Rosie also have a loving and respectful relationship with their grandparents, and they also learn about kindness to elderly neighbors as well as those who live in nursing homes. Along with educational adventures, I think the show portrays nice character traits such as kindness, respect, and friendship. This movie is fun and festive, and it gives some great historical accounts while building a child's excitement and awe of the Christmas season.  I wish new Caillou shows and movies were in production!",1420329600,3,934,4.942675159235669

1907831,2,B0000AKCJP,"My granddaughter loved this, but I didn't like it as much as the regular series. WAY too much singing. The regular Caillou series is based on Caillou's day-to-day dillemas, moral and otherwise. Although he's a little over the top sweet, he's a good kid at heart and I like the character. This Christmas version isn't as appealing to me as an adult, but my granddaughter always thinks Caillou is great.",1416873600,,401,4.742857142857143

1907836,3,B0000AKCJP,"Five stars for the film, but two for this DVD release at best. If you have the original DVD release of this film or can get it, then there is nothing worth bothering with here. No closed-captions or subtitles, no French or Spanish language tracks like the original disc, and while this DVD has the Caillou interview and two sing-alongs that were originally included, it's missing the six games found on the original. For something billed as being released celebrate Caillou's 25th anniversary, this is a really poor showing.",1415750400,6,524,4.898876404494382

She watched this movie three times in a row the first day I gave it to her. Needless to say I'm over it! But it is something she enjoys time and time again.

I recommend it for all the little kids who love stories about Christmas.  Caillou learns about Christmas traditions around the world.  Very cute.",1391644800,,297,4.979591836734694
1907847,5,B0000AKCJP,"It's a cute little movie and all, but it really should come with a warning. I don't know what it is about this movie, but little children seem to find it to be highly addictive.  If your little one is a Caillou fan, then get ready to have this bad boy invading your dvd player for the entirety of the holiday season. The pros are that you'll have a good hour to yourself every day - possibly twice a day.  The con - you'll hear this darn thing in your sleep.",1388534400,,458,4.021978021978022

1907850,1,B0000AKCJP,"Thank God I don't have to spend Christmas in Caillou's house!  It sounds like a real pain in the butt!  His parents are radical liberals who teach him all about Christmas in other countries, yet don't say one word about Jesus.  Caillou is going to have a party at his preschool, and he tells his mom that the children are supposed to bring in Christmas things.  Her response?  ""You mean holiday things.  Your friends celebrate many different holidays at this time of year.""  (Word police, anyone?)  This is just another classic example of the left's war on Christmas!  Caillou makes a Christmas list of all the toys he wants, but then his mom starts singing this stupid song about how he is a ""Me-Me Boy"" for wanting toys.  They then go to the fire station to give away a box of his toys.  Just what every little kid wants to do, right? (Redistribution of wealth, anyone?)  Then his Grandma comes over to make Christmas cookies.  Why, you ask?  To give them to old people at a retirement home, of course.  Fun, big fun!  I know it's supposed to be nice, but they go way overboard.  At the end, Caillou only gets two crappy gifts, a little plastic ""Space Station"" that looks like it cost $1, and a little snowman figure that his baby sister made for him.  Wow!  That was worth waiting all year for, right?",1385683200,7,1304,4.4491525423728815
1907851,5,B0000AKCJP,"We had another copy of this movie that got compromised.  My whole family enjoyed its approach to Christmas and winter activities.  It is very family oriented.  However, this is the one to have because it is the best of the Caillou Christmas movies I have seen.  We have other Caillou Christmas movies and this one really is the best.  You learn about other cultures and do the advent calender with the family and learn about giving because you want to give not because everyone else is.",1384214400,,486,4.604651162790698

1907875,5,B0000AKCJP,"Caillou is a sweet 4 year old boy from Sprout PBS show who will encourage your own children to be kind, share and learn more about themselves. My own 4 year old LOVES Caillou and wants to be just like him. The only downside if the little squeaky voice that my son tried to imitate as he tries to be like him in every way. But I can live with that because of the sweet moments like at the store the other day he helped his little brother and he said ""Because that's would Caillou would do!""  This movie is a full length holiday movie I am sure we will be watching year round. We borrowed it from the library on many occasions and had to get our own copy :)",1261353600,,655,4.0

Pros: - It's over 70 minutes long, so its perfect for putting into the car DVD player to entertain the kiddies on a long car ride to the Grandparents.
- It shows many different cultures' holiday celebrations.
- It has all of your favorite Caillou characters.
- Lots of catchy tunes.
- It doesn't have the puppet or kiddie segments that the normal Caillou DVDs have. While this doesn't affect me one way or the other, my little girl hates them and always requests I fast forward past them.

Con: - It doesn't have the puppet or kiddie segments (if you or your little ones enjoy them).

We've had this movie for about a year now, and my kids request it several times a month. While the missus and I are tired of it ... it doesn't matter how good something is, anything eventually grates on you ... the target audience, my kids, love it.",1255046400,,1099,4.430693069306931

The songs are catchy (did I just admit that, but to my defense, this movie has been played about 20 times since I've bought it for the kids).

They should just call it Caillou's Christmas Movie, because it is about Christmas.

The other reviewer is correct as the movie is all animation without the puppet segments. But you know what I prefer it that way. My son always mistook Rexy and the other puppets as interruptions and they never held his attention for too long. The movie has very beautiful songs and truly gets in the spirit of Christmas, giving, love, family, friendship, etc. I do not want to spoil the movie for others but it is kid friendly packed with morals. Now I am a sociologist so I may be just a bit biased but I absolutely loooove how the creators added how other cultures in the world celebrate Christmas not just the U.S. (Puerto Rico, Germany, Austria, Mexico etc.) They also gave a bit of historical background (How the Christmas tree came about, etc) This is a nice touch for anyone who shares a different background or just would like their children to know how other little children celebrate Christmas!

*2 holiday songs

*'Twas the Night Before Christmas Story

*Six Caillou challenges

I admit, I'm not a big fan of Caillou as an adult. I think the illustrations are simplistic and flat, and Caillou is usually a whiny brat. So, it was with a little trepidation that I bought this holiday DVD last year. I have to say, though, that it's a fine holiday movie and much more engaging than the show.

Caillou's voice is noticeably different (the original voice-actor died in a car accident last year) but it's not bothersome.  My child loved learning, along with Caillou, about the various ways Christmas is celebrated.  My kids danced at each song.  Even though it's Spring here, my child wanted to get the Christmas tree out.  She hit ""replay"" as soon as it was over.  Fun was had by all.",1083542400,3,563,4.925531914893617

This movie covers all the wonderment of the holiday season from baking cookies with Grandma to donating toys to the needy to going out with the family to get a live Christmas tree.  My kids (and I) can't stand the interruptions of the puppets and the live kids singing on the regular Caillou show, so this was perfectly pure Calliou.  I would highly recommend this video.",1079049600,2,497,4.811764705882353
1907932,5,B0000AKCJP,"Okay, first of all, let's go through the quirks. The first one is that the advertisement of 6 games being on the DVD is rather misleading. There is actually only two games, each with 3 levels. The second one is that the sing-alongs are actually more of music videos, since they lack the lyrics being displayed in either a overlay, subtitle or even in closed captions. The last one is that they did not credit the casts of the Spanish soundtrack. While the Spanish soundtrack is well done, the cast were not credited, and even though the Spanish track has a dedicated opening title card, it just used the closing credits of the English version. While this is not much of a problem to most, enquiring minds of Caillou fans want to know: who did the voices and singing of the Spanish soundtrack?
Anyway, apart from the minor quirks listed above, there the movie was just as Cinar announced it to be: touching, funny and warm. It has the right mix of catchy music and dialogs, and there is enough humour to keep one entertained throughout the movie. Viewers feel Caillou's frustration when he is separated from his beloved Rexy and spends a third of the movie on and off trying to find him (Rexy), laugh at the scene where Rosie drops a roll of toilet paper into a box full of stuff to be donated to needy children, and feel the warmth of the scenes at night where Caillou's Mommy sings him a song about Santa's different names around the world. Also, viewers will get to learn about how Christmas is celebrated throughout the world, plus a little bit about Hannukah. Also, the interview, while not being related to the show, is good for a laugh if nothing else.
Overall, it's a good movie, even though there are one or two quirks. It's also worth a mention that the movie makes a lot of references to past episodes of the TV show. It's worth a mention that Annie Bovaird does the voice of Caillou in the movie instead of Jaclyn Linetsky, and that the movie is a departure from a regular episode of the show and lacks both the grandma-reading-to-kids opening that's found on the older version of the show and the puppet segments that's found on the PBS airings - it's 73 Minutes of pure Caillou and nothing else.
In a nutshell: good movie, and the minor quirks are easy to overlook (especially if you get the DVD only for the movie). I give it two thumbs up.",1075420800,2,2354,4.476744186046512
1907933,5,B0000AKCJP,"Thank you CINAR for doing such a great job on this production.  Caillou, as others have noted, is really not as whiney in this movie as he is in the TV shows. That is a super change. Caillou is a thoughtful, generous, loving little man in this movie and a great model for our 3 year old son who adores him. The movie includes many of the people that Caillou has met over the series on television.
In this movie Caillou comes across as a little bit older (don't worry he's still 4) in his behavior. It enabled us to use Caillou's behavior as an example of how our son should behave, rather than what he shouldn't do as happens a lot on the TV show.
My wife and I noticed the change in Caillou's voice but it did not detract from our son's enjoyment. Rosie is very cute and is on her way to being potty trained.  Poor Gilbert gets locked behind every door in the house until Rosie rescues him.
Gone and NOT MISSED are the non animated vignettes. We don't mind the scenes with Rexy, Gilbert, and Teddy so much but the other scenes with the live children seem like they are just fillers.
This is a MUST for all Caillou fans, and if you don't like the whiney TV Cailloo you WILL like this one :)
Happy Christmas Everyone!!!",1072915200,7,1218,4.223175965665236
1907934,4,B0000AKCJP,My kids ages 2 and 4 enjoyed this movie for the Christmas season.  I did notice my 2 year old asked for the movie more than my 4 year old though.  The songs in it were catchy and it got my 4 year old interested in our advent calender.  I'd recommend this movie for young children.,1072742400,,280,3.9642857142857144
1907935,3,B0000AKCJP,MY 3 Y/O LOVES CALLIOU AND THIS VIDEO IS NO DIFFERENT. THE ONLY THING I CAN'T GET USED TO IS THE GIRLY VOICE. CALLIOU'S VOICE IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE TV SERIES. IT CONFUSED MY SON BECAUSE HE COULDN'T TELL WHO WAS TALKING.,1071100800,3,224,4.232558139534884
1907936,5,B0000AKCJP,My boys are age 3 and 4.  The four year old's eyes sparkled and the three year old just smiled as they watched.  Kids grow up so fast....its nice to see them enjoy something that is calm and sweet.  Its a nice movie.  Caillou did not whine and ask so many stupid questions.,1069804800,5,273,4.09433962264151
1907937,5,B0000AKCJP,"My 2-year old loves Caillou.  Add in snow, songs, decorations, holiday cheer, sledding, Santa and gifts and you've got a winner! She is learning the catchy new Caillou songs that I even enjoy.  One of the best things is the movie is all Caillou..none of the Rexy/Teddy segments they have on the PBS show.
From an educational standpoint, the kids will learn holiday customs from around the world.  Hopefully they will also catch onto the giving and sharing theme emphasized throughout the hour and ten minute movie.
This is a fun, festive movie with Caillou and his family and friends. Even the older kids should enjoy it!",1069286400,6,621,4.785046728971962
1907938,4,B0000AKCJP,"Looking at ""Caillou's Holiday Movie,"" it's obvious that the staff of the show was going for someting a little different. Stories in the show itself are only an average of five minutes long, but this is a full ninety-minute presentation.
The writers and animators seem to have been successful and the result is a great story with beautiful musical interludes that kids will enjoy watching. There's a lot to be learned about holiday traditions from around the world, much of it coming from a twelve days of Christmas calendar that Caillou receives as present from Daddy. Although there are no puppet segments, most of the best characters are present in the story, including some favorite guest characters that are nice references to past stories. Fans of Rosie will also enjoy the movie and the special way in which she surprises everyone in Caillou's family.
If buying the DVD, note that while the story is good, the special features really aren't much to cheer about. The Caillou interview bonus doesn't actually relate to the movie, but is actually more of a cute filler segment in which Sarah attempts an interview with Caillou for her school, but can't get straight answers out of Caillou and then experiences technical difficulties. The ""singalongs"" are simply cut from the movie, they don't even have lyrics at the bottom of the screen or close-captioning to follow along. Finally, the promotion of ""six Caillou challenges"" is somewhat miselading. There are a two games including, each with three levels, for a total of six ""challenges.""",1068768000,39,1542,5.003891050583658
