897797,5,6304435096,"Lucio Fulci's ""City of the Living Dead"" is a truly macabre and horrendously violent film. Released in the U.S.A. as ""The Gates of Hell, it was one of the films to watch as a youngster for it's graphic  depiction of violent deaths. These included the lovingly disguting  regurgitation of a woman's innards, the drill press through the head, and  numerous other bloody sequences. Amazingly, this film is not a mere  ""geek show"" and is surprisingly well made and atmospheric in its  presentation. The DVD provides an excellent picture and is far and away  superior to any VHS copy. If you are a fan of extreme Italian horror, this  is for you....if not, stay very far away.",959299200,4,670,4.724137931034483
897798,2,6304435096,"""The Gates of Hell"" illustrates all the weaknesses of Fulci's films (pointless gore, non-sensical plotlines, horrible acting) and few of his strengths (effective well-placed gore, atmosphere, cinematography), and  I'm amazed to see how popular the movie is on some of the better horror Web  sites. Basically, it's an excuse for buckets of gore: the head-drilling  scene, while a triumph of special effects, serves absolutely no purpose in  the ""story"" (yeah, right)-- Fulci doesn't even revisit the  characters involved! And for one of his later movies, the cinematography is  on a level with ""House By the Cemetary"" (another Fulci stinker)  and far from his best work. The movie gets two stars in my book for it's  only two truly frightening scenes: the heroine, buried alive, gasps for air  and frantically scratches at the ceiling of her coffin, while the hero  (sorry, can't remember names!) tries to free her with a pic axe, barely  missing her face with each swing. Very chilling! And in another scene, the  priest/zombie nemesis puts a young woman into some sort of trance-- blood  begins to spill from her eyes, and one by one her internal organs are  vomited, speeding up until her intestines fly out of her mouth and her  now-hollow body collapses. Truly nasty. At any rate, ""the Beyond""  is essentially the same movie, just WORLDS better, and I'd also recommend  ""Zombie"" over GOH. But, if straight up nastiness is your thing  and plots don't do much for you, enjoy it (on an empty stomach, please).",959212800,2,1510,4.948207171314741
897799,5,6304435096,"This is Fulci at his darkest hour... a zombie movie paced and structured  more like a slasher film, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD has the distinction of  containing two of Fulci's trademark gore scenes:  a girl vomiting up her  own intestine and a retarded boy getting a power drill through the head.  Although there aren't too many zombies and they don't show up too often up  until nearly the end, this film is so unrelentingly dark and miserable that  it's hard to dismiss.  Fulci here has created an ""absolute film""  which comes closer to capturing the nightmare than any other film.  Great,  so long as you can tune out Dardano Sacchetti's ridiculous scripting and  dialog, containing numerous factual errors.  The excellent cast includes  the late Christopher George, Catriona MacColl, Carlo De Mejo (son of Alida  Valli), Venantino Venantini and his son Luca, hot Swedish superbabe Janet  Agren, Giovanni Lombado Radice (who got his head hacked in half in Cannibal  Ferox) and the blonde guy who got demasculated in Cannibal  Holocaust.
Anchor Bay's DVD is a must-have.  Previous versions of the  films (Japanese Laserdisc, Paragon's and Creature Feature's tapes) were  nothing short of horrible.  Here, Sergio Salvati's photography is finally  VISIBLE and the film is no longer saturated in blue.  On top of that, it's  got a roaring 5.1 dolby mix better than anything I've ever heard!  Turn  your speakers all the way up and let MacColl's scream at the beginning  shake your house.  Plus, the film is letterboxed in an aspect ratio much  greater than I've seen it in previously.

897800,5,6304435096,"The best Fulci movies are The Beyond, Zombie, House by the Cemetary and The gates of hell. These are classics in modern classic horror. I am sick of people knocking this film.

897801,3,6304435096,"The priest of a small town hangs himself, causing the gates of hell to open, and the whole town is plunged into a nightmare...""Gates of Hell"" is the US title for ""City of The Living Dead"" which,  along with ""House By The Cemetary"" and ""The Beyond"",  makes up Fulci's gothic horror trilogy from the early 1980's.  Unfortunately, ""Gates of Hell"" is the weakest of the three, but  it still has many classic moments, and sustains a mood of eerie tension  throughout, with the whole town submerged in menacing mist, and dead bodies  inexplicably returning to life. The film is also punctuated by scenes of  outrageous gore! Highlights include the nail-biting rescue of Katherine  Macoll who has been buried alive in a graveyard - her rescuer whacks a  giant pick-axe into the coffin, missing her face by inches every time!  Another character is drilled right through the head on an industrial  workbench - a fantastic effect. Sadly, the plot is incredibly daft, and  hard to follow, and the twist ending is bewildering to say the least. It  appears that Fulci has basically just reworked the whole plot of the far  superior ""The Beyond"" here, using far too many of the same ideas,  just with different ways of killing his characters.",957312000,2,1228,4.8086124401913874
897950,3,6304435096,"Another laughable night at the Abattoir with Lucio Fulci.  The thing is, careful riding of fast forward on this picture would let you enjoy everything about it that you need to experience in about 10 minutes. Sort of the same way the trailer for it on 42nd street back in the early 80s showed you everything worth seeing about the picture so that you didn't have to actually pay the $3.50 to see it in the theater, although the theater was part of the show in those days. Chris ""I'll be in anything"" George at least gets to have his Brains ripped out of his head, which is gratifying. The nonsense-level runs very high, some of the the special effects are awful (jump- cuts,  anyone? And notice the very visible little tubes taped at the outside edge of the actress' eyes when the ghost-priest tries his final head-hemmorhage during the climax) but others are quite striking, at least if you don't watch on a full stomach.  And Fulci manages to blatantly rip off the striking ending of John Llewellyn Moxey's stellar HORROR HOTEL with none of the emotional drama of THAT classic picture present in THIS one in any way. (And Fulci may even be subtly copping to his rip-off: Horror Hotel was originally titled ""City of the Dead"" upon its initial release in the UK... now there some Trivia to throw at somebody. )",1518220800,3,1310,4.56595744680851

The ending makes no sense though, like why is the woman screaming for? But if you like a lot of blood and gore than you will probably like it, at least for a one time watch or twice watch if it has been a few decades since you last watched it,lol! Also if you do like this one check out Zombie as well, it too is made by Lucio Fulci, and I think it's a bit better!

897956,5,6304435096,"This review is for the old Anchor Bay DVD release. I've got this on Blu-ray now, and the Blu-ray is obviously the preferred way to see it as it offers a great clear picture. However, my old Anchor Bay DVD release that I still have would probably be considered by some people to be a scarier way to watch the film. The Anchor Bay DVD is grittier and cruder looking. It's also quite darker than the brightened up Blu-ray from Blue Underground. The film itself is one of the best horror films ever with great atmosphere as the dead rises in the creepy town of Dunwich. They are reanimated by a priest committing suicide, and they don't resemble the normal zombies in other flicks because they actually have the power to teleport and just appear. They prefer to tear out brains, and in the now classic sequence, the priest with his powers makes a woman vomit her guts out. The Blu-ray is the best and most enjoyable way to see it, but if you're a longtime fan of the film like me, you might want that old Anchor Bay DVD as well.",1516320000,,1024,4.338541666666667

897959,2,6304435096,"So, this is part of the wave of gory Italian horror movies of the late '70s and early '80s. They don't skimp on the blood or the guts, but they sure didn't pay much attention to the plot or the characters. When you aren't confused, you're bored, but you'll mostly be confused (I guess that's a mild positive?) A priest hangs himself to kick off the end of the world, someone gets prematurely buried, everyone has skulls made out of papier mache, magic teleporting zombies kill a few random townsfolk, and the unstoppable cosmic evil is undone by a pointy stick...or IS it? The ending made me roll my eyes so hard I got a face cramp. No two plot threads connect to one another in a way that makes sense or moves the story anywhere but closer to the end credits. There's a few nice make-up jobs on the living dead,  some interesting sets, and one or two jaw-droppingly weird sequences (one involving something like 50 pounds of meal-worms and a very large fan), but this movie makes not one lick of sense.  The few high points were not quite high enough to be worth my time, but your mileage may vary. The horror is supposed to come across as Lovecraftian (the city of the living dead is called Dunwich), but misses the mark by miles. It's a zombie apocalypse with about fifteen zombies altogether. You'd be better off with ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Phantasm"".",1499731200,4,1352,4.491869918699187

898130,5,6304435096,"ATMOSPHERE! Really the main element that makes a Fulci movie great is atmosphere. Most all of his horror films that I have seen have a ""dreamlike"" quality about them, or ""nightmare"" if you prefer. Some people can't forgive what seem like minor plot holes or ""unreal"" special effects, but you have to remember that these victims are dealing with the ""supernatural"" and as such they can not even completely trust everything their eyes see, and so, neither can the audience. So the evil dead spirits could be making these victims see things in an even more exaggerated and distorted way. I have only recently gotten acquainted with Fulci in the last 2-3 years, and so, thanks to the advent of DVD, I am slowly watching all of his films. Fulci is truly a Maestro and is sorely underappreciated by some. I have seen ""The Beyond"" ""House by the Cemetery"" and now, ""City of the Living Dead!"" So far I am the most taken with COTLD. It is the most gothic of these three. I do love the utter feeling of dread at the end of ""The Beyond"" which is a great movie also. As one reviewer so aptly put it, this film has a ""surreal"" Lovecraftian feel to it.  As I watched COTLD it also reminded me of one of my favorite movies of all time-PHANTASM! Phantasm was released in 1979 and I believe this film was released in 1980 in Europe and 1983 in the U.S.. I don't know for sure, but I can't help but wonder how much Phantasm influenced Fulci's vision. The scene in the mortuary with the coffins, the funeral home director preparing the bodies reminded me a little of the tall man, much of the music reminded me of the Phantasm theme, and the drill bit in Bobby's head reminded me of the silver spheres. This is in no way meant to take away from Fulci's talent as this is a very special film and both he an Don Coscarelli did so much with so little, and if these films are related in anyway I think that's terrific! We all have our influences and if you are a fellow fan of Phantasm, but not of Fulci's work, look again. A very special movie and a tremendous talent of a Director. Also, Fulci's crew of craftsman responsible for the fog, dust, and non-computer generated effects are to be applauded! I can't wait to see more of Fulci's titles.

On a side note, I love horror films, but I don't fear the dead rising as living dead due to some malevolent force. Only Jesus, The King of Glory, has power over the dead! Just saying!

Peace out,

""All Hail The Lion of Judah........and Live!""",1448928000,3,2466,4.389496717724289

Back then it was called The Gates of Hell and it was so weird and disturbing. I still remember specific, gory scenes and I can't believe they actually showed that on TV back then. After seeing this in HD, I have to say it still delivers! The story line is tighter and the acting and dubbing better, so the hilarity factor is much less than other Fulci films but that just makes the horror much more intense.

Now before all the fan boys get their panties in a bunch, i like 70's horror and Italian horror, that said this movie was objectively awful. The only saving grace for this movie was the gore effects which were actually pretty freakin awesome. The rest of this movie was just a trainwreck. The acting was literally the worst I have ever seen, the dubbing was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, the decisions made by people were insultingly bad, everything except the gore was bad.

First of all, the police sergeant or whatever in the beginning was the worst acting and dubbing combo Ive ever had the misfortune of seeing. Also this town looks to be a fairly heavily suburban east coast town that has its own psychiatrist and looks to even have townhouses and apartments, yet they expect us to believe it doesnt show up on any maps? Come on, seriously? Also at the end the police know the dead are coming back to life and theres a portal to hell that needs to be closed but they decide to say hey ""lets let the freaking psychiatrist, the reporter, and some crazy chick handle it."" what? Also the maggot scene drags on forever and the ""actors' don't seem to mind or even really react at all to having just been spreyed down with literally millions of maggots. they act completely normal afterwards. What? And then to top off the crap cake the ending was the most try hard, no sense making, stupid pile of crap Ive yet seen.

All in all don't watch this movie if you can avoid it, it took me 3 tries to get through and almost 4. The gore parts are pretty cool though so its hard for me to just say stay away no matter what but just know it will be a hard slog.",1413244800,2,1766,4.316265060240964

898395,4,6304435096,"The plot involves a priest hanging himself somewhere in Dunwich (a fictional town created by H.P. Lovecraft), thereby opening the gates of hell.  Or, something like that.  It's a bit confusing from the outset, due to abrupt cuts from one brief scene to another.  There's a sance in New York, a woman seemingly dies of fright.  Apparently, this was well before embalming because she's buried alive.  If not for a nosy reporter (Christopher George), she would have remained buried.  Most of these disjointed scenes make little sense in the scheme of things (like suddenly showing a strange guy in an abandoned building greeting a blowup porn doll!).  Characters are introduced in the oddest fashion, be it a therapy secession or some yokels in a bar.  We're only given brief glimpses before the scenes switch faster than the click of a View Master.  Fulci uses the same effect for his zombies/ghosts, making them appear then disappear with alarming repetition.  I found it more than a little disconcerting watching them bounce all over the place; in front of a person then behind them, gouging the brains out of their skulls.  There's also a fabulous head drilling sequence that feels as though it was only included to demonstrate what great skills the FX department had.  What it had to do with anything in the story was remote.  If Fulci wanted to achieve a sense of surrealism then he certainly succeeded, but at the expense of coherence (I'm still puzzling over the abrupt ending that doesn't feel as though it's saying what it should be saying at that point).

I love a few of the set pieces, but I'm also exasperated by the strange disorganized disorder the plagues this film from start to finish.  If I had to pick a favorite scene it's when our plucky but doomed heroes are under a cemetery and there are skeletons hanging from the ceiling/ground.  Now there's a great image.  The rest is just maggots blowin' in the wind.",1411948800,4,1928,4.77643504531722

 Lucio Fulci directed this Italian yawner.  He seems to be making his career by directing not very good Zombie movies.  This is in that tradition.  It isn't his worst Zombie movie nor his best.  Lets call it somewhere in the boring middle.
 He does bring famous American actor Christopher George (most famous for the Rat Patrol on TV) to the Italian Cine.  His co-star is the English actress Cartiona MacColl, known for her work in European films.  She had film work as recently as 2007.  Sadly, even these veteran troopers cannot make a success of this movie.
 The premise is promising but the execution is flawed and the script, as we see too often in European films presented to the American audience, is incoherent.  A priest hangs himself, we never know why, which somehow provided the opportunity for the gates of hell to open.  At a sance, the MacColl character sees the problem, but dies.  When she is buried, George discovers that she is really still alive and rescues her.  Again there is explanation neither for her death nor for her rebirth, in this movie stuff just happens.  And so on until the confusion finally ends when the ghost of the dead priest is stabbed with a board causing him and a host of Zombies to burst into flame.  There is an additional bizarre, needless and nonsensical twist at the end.
 Fulci chooses to film this one in a sort of Film Noir style that is at once un-necessary and pretentious.  The director has not done his job if we focus on his technique rather than on the story.  On the other hand the special effects are well done for the time and the Zombies are creepy.  They are supernatural Zombies from Hell rather than regular Zombies but they still like to eat brains.
 Only two brains for this one hour 33 minutes Italian flick from 1980.  Although the film was released in the US in 1983 there seems to be no connection between the release and the fatal heart attack suffered by Christopher George that same year.  Not rated but the gore factor is low and there is NO nudity, an Italian first, and no bad language.",1409529600,,2087,4.536193029490617

898401,4,6304435096,"I love this era and these movies make me wish I was 12 years old again. City of the Living Dead shares a similarity in name to a Romero film, but the films are very different. City is the second film in a trilogy of films written and directed by maestro Lucio Fulci. The other two films are also classics, House by the Cemetary and The Beyond.

The movie takes place in the fictional town of Dunwich, a town built on the ruins of the real town of Salem, Massachusetts. !?!?!? It begins with the suicide of a local priest, Father Thomas. Because of his suicide, it opens the gates of hell. Afterward, anyone he appears to turns into a zombie. A local psychologist and two outsiders, a reporter and a psychic, race to close the gates.

I don't want to give anything away.

Seeing a lot of the bad reviews makes me believe that this generation is spoiled and that is why they cannot enjoy these type of films. This is why they are enamored with Rob Zombie's Halloween films and remakes in general.

I recommend this film to any child of the 80's or anyone who enjoys that era.

There is a spate of constant ""unseasonal"" windstorms!
Glass breaks without any apparent cause ( ""It could've been the vibration from a passing truck or something"" somebody theorizes ) and a wall then cracks open and smoke and a strange eerrie howling voice emit from the fracture!
An inexplicably terrified cat claws it's owner!
A woman has a terrifying vision which puts her in a comma, . . from which she later awakens to find her self sealed alive in a coffin and slowly suffocating!!
The corpse of a deceased old woman mysteriously turns up on the floor of a horrified and astonished womans kitchen, .. and then subsequently disappears from same in a similarly inexplicable manner ( ""Maybe she just left!"" )!
A raging blizzard of live maggots ( that's right, .. MAGGOTS ) occures!
A painting pierced by flying shards of shattered glass BLEEDS!!
 And the recently deceased return as living dead that kill their victims by groping crushing and ripping open their scalps open, including a murdered young girl ( who supposedly died of ""sheer fright"" ) who revisits her family and murders her parents ( ""It WAS Emily!! .. . only she was different!  She was like, . .. dead!! .. and she was eating mummy and daddy!!"" ), .. or, in the case with the evil priest ( also now resurrected as a ""zombie"" ), by seemingly transfixing his victims ( who seem to only be female ) with his gaze and causing them to literally regurgitate their selves to death!
The day is saved, however, when the quartet of heros ( a reporter, the aforementioned female seer, a psychiatrist, and his female patient ), having broken and descended into a rat infested underground tomb, confront the evil padre and drive a large splintery wooden crucifix right through his crotch ( eeeeeeow!!!!! ), .. which then bursts into flames, as do likewise the army of walking dead,  and the raging conflagration consumes them all, reducing them to cinders!

This flick is particularly famous and renowned for it's spectacular and outlandish gore scenes, . .. especially the aforementioned regurgitation scene. First her eyes bleed what appear to be tears of crimson ( a pretty striking image in it'self actually ) and then she literally pukes her guts out.
The most horrifying and disturbing scene in the film, however, which doesn't even really seem to have much to to with all the previously related supernatural and living dead business of the main story and seems to basically be something of a subplot, is one in which a young vagrant and social pariah type, who's blamed for the aforementioned death of the girl by gosiping local town folks ( THAT seems to be his connection to the main plot ), is caught with another young girl by her appauled and furrious father in his garage, who then beats the guy up and kills him by skewering his head with a power drill fastened to his work bench. Other scenes in this movie, like the girl vomiting her guts out scene described previously, are, however shocking and gross, rather far-fetched,  campy and absurd, .. but THIS is something that could actually happen in REAL LIFE and is therefore truly horrifying and disturbing rather than being merely gory and shocking.

The ""zombies"", .. or ghosts, .. . which ever they are ( they seem to be a kind of combination of both ) are certainly strange and unusual, and are visually pretty frightening and disturbing with their crusty visages and fetid clothing, looking ( to me at least ) as though they've been burnt ( which would make sense considering that they've supposedly came back from death, . .. or from Hell ? ) . They, it should be noted, aren't present throughout the whole movie though ( as the title and promotion seems to suggest ), but appear in mainly a few scenes, including the aforementioned bit about the dead girl killing her family and appearing to her traumatized little brother afterward, and a scene where they invade a tavern and attack a bunch of hick barflies.

Additionally, there are also what appeares to be a discovered human body being devoured by worms ( looking more like it belongs in that movie 'Squirm than in this film ), a looter in a funeral parlor stealing jewelry from displayed corpses getting his hand chewed, rats nibbling a dead victims exposed brains, and a couple of crude talking graveyard workers siting over a skeleton in an opened grave and making comments like ""Saw this porno flick once where a guy got so horny that he humped himself to death!! Too much of a good thing I guess! But what a way to go!!""

This flick also features some good horror atmosphere, a scarry musical score, and some actors with the ugliest or creepiest faces ( Director Fulci definately had a knack for casting people for their unique physical appearances ), particularly the ugly barflies, and this eerrie dame named Madame Theresa.

This is the first film of his gates of hell trilogy which began with this then The Beyond (his masterpiece) and finally ""House By The Cemetery"" as it has a connection to them both loosely. This is another movie that followed in the footsteps of George Romero's successful ""Dawn of the Dead"" and one of the better imitators so far but this one is more in the tradition of ""Phantasm"" but does have a small element of Dawn in it with a supernatural twist to it. This one features teleporting zombie-esque ghosts that can literally rip a person's brains out then eat a person but can be destroyed in an unusual way unlike the traditional bullet in the head which is interesting. The story is a little silly but the atmosphere makes it up as it's spooky and loaded with memorable gore from the infamous scene where a girl is hypnotized by the priest's spirit then her eyes bleed then she literally pukes her insides out with blood to the drilling sequence done on famed Italian star Giovanni Lombardo Radice (Italy's whipping boy on film). The film is also known in 1983 when it came here to the states as ""The Gates of Hell"" to other titles like ""Twilight Of The Dead"" or ""Fear in The City of the Living Dead"" to others, this movie has gained success here in the states and other countries despite being banned in a few countries as it became a cult classic even in Japan that it could be one of the inspirations to the Silent Hill games. I first saw this movie when i was 10 years old on video when i rented it as ""Gates of Hell"" and thought it was one of the scariest/grossest films i've ever seen as it made me a Fulci fan since.

The Blue Underground special 30th anniversary blu-ray is absolutely stunning in highly detailed picture and surround sound that makes it one of BU's best blu-rays ever and heaven for High-def horror junkies. The extras are cool too like a 32 minute documentary on the film to interviews with the stars like Catriona MacColl and Giovanni Lombardo Radice, a featurette on teh cast/crew working with fulci, poster & still gallery, theatrical trailers and radio spots.",1350691200,4,3020,4.559852670349908
898567,3,6304435096,"The plot was pretty wild, a priest hangs himself and it opens up a portal to hell on Halloween.

Not the kind of tradition zombies (Romero style) you might see. They were zombies far too powerful. They were super strong, like crush your skull with one hand strong. They could also give you a stare and make you vomit out your guts. They could also...teleport! WAY t0o powerful.

One large problem was the zombie rules varied on the given situation. One of the leads was confronted with a zombie, closed his eyes hard, and it just disappeared. If this was an effective way to defeat the zombies, why didn't he do so again when confronted by other zombies? Inconsistent plot elements litter this film.

The acting was pretty good though, as was the dubbing (it's an italian film).

2.5 stars, based on plot holes as described above, and my personal preference for Romero zombies.",1328572800,,877,4.675324675324675

Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" ""Dawn of the Dead"" & ""Day of the Dead"" ever since I first saw these magnificent films when I was younger. The first time I saw Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"" I was immediately hooked on his style of horror. I am a huge fan of Argento as well.... but for me, Fulci takes the cake on gore. I have yet to see a Fulci film that I was unsatisfied with. ""City of the Living Dead"" to me is one of Fulci's masterpieces. Along with some of his other works such as ""The Beyond"" ""House by the Cemetery"" & ""Demonia"" ... ""City of the Living Dead"" is a film I will never grow tired of. I definately recommend this film to any horror fan. It does have intense scenes of violence & gore... but thats one of the reasons why I find Fulci's style so entertaining & fascinating. 5 stars all day long!!!",1327536000,2,941,4.147540983606557
898569,4,6304435096,"I could have given this film 5-stars were it not for Fulci's penchant for gratuitous gore.  Not just any old gore, though; oh no, only the grossest gore will do.  Worms (presumably ""conqueror worms"") on every corpse - even the ones dead only two days - carries vileness very near the top; the inundation of worms spewing out of the cemetery into Jerry's Studio takes it way over the edge.  This is of a type with farting contests; it's all about seeing who can be the grossest.  You're either into that sort of thing, or you're not.  And, as they say, include me out.

Minus the gore, this was a chillingly effective supernatural thriller - far more a ghost story than an actual zombie movie.  It wasn't so much about the reanimation of the dead as it was about the souls in hell coming though the gates of hell, left ajar by Father Thomas Williams, to possess the dead - and, of course, butcher the living.  By far the most chilling sequence was Mary Wodehouse's cumbersome rescue from her premature burial by the reporter (Christopher George); trust me, you'd want to be rescued with a little more finesse than he exhibited.

The setting and atmosphere were as good as anything you're going to find in a ""Grade B"" or, for that matter, even a ""Grade A"" movie.  The acting was sufficient for the dialogue, which was almost as dark and foreboding as the locale.  The story, however, did take its merry (or make that gloomy) old time getting told; which is probably what led some reviewers to dismiss the movie as boring.  The ending was a masterpiece of irony, with Mary and Jerry accomplishing everything required to close the gates of hell before midnight of All Saints Day, when the dead could escape.  Except they were a little too late.  All Saints Day had already arrived.",1316304000,2,1777,4.582278481012659

Trust me,if you watch it you will know what I mean.  Also, watch out for the cameo by Mr. Fulci himself, who plays the coroner.  The long and the short, if you're looking for oscar worthy performances and special effects, you may want to give this a pass.

Of course, there had been Horror films with extreme gore before, like Dawn of the Dead and others, like the Herschell Gordon Lewis flicks, but after the end of the 70th's the 80th's came and everything changed.

In the US this movie wasn't of course not the kind of controversial, like many people thought here in my country Germany: The country were movies with violence get banned quickly, because they glorify violence (well that's the policy made by
the judges here). But after all there not so wrong about that, take the movie The Grim Geaper for instance, with a man who becomes a cannibal and eats his own family alive, in a very disgusting sequence he attacks a pregant woman and pulls here fetus out and eats it!! Sick stuff.

But here we are walking on the same terrain, extreme violence mixed with really explicit gore scenes. The most infamous drill through the head scene is a classic,
but also it is really not quite reproducible. We know that the young guy want to have sex with the girl. But is that really required to kill him instantly that for?? Movies have to be a little bit logical (Hello Spock!)... so far

But here it is different, there are people getting killed and you don't understand why, but what the hell it's a horror movie, so nobody cares.

In Germany the movie started under the title: a zombie is hanging on an agitator and very soon the district attorney saw the film and had him banned. Only bootlegs
became very rare and because the wave of this horror genre just started in 1980, the german television showed a programm right in the middle of the kids programm with the descent title: Mum, Dad & Zombie. This was of course quite the best advertising this genre could get.

Many children saw this ""documentary"" live and in full colour, also they saw quite some gory stuff, and extreme violence as well. Breasts being cut by a big knife, acid showed down at a mans throat and he's puking his guts out, heads being shots by a pump gun and blown up (Maniac) and much more. Just for determent reasons of course, but the people of the broadcasting company could realize that many youngster watch this stuff with a parent or adult guardin.

898613,4,6304435096,"City of the Living Dead is a 1980 horror/zombie film by Italian director Lucio Fulci.  It tells the story of a priest that hangs himself in a cemetery which consequently opens the gates to Hell.  Zombies of substantial, elevated powers are then released upon the wee town of Dunwich, New England.

I just saw this movie for the first time today, and it's my opinion that the reason I liked it so much is because of my age.  I'm 36, and this film brought back some wonderful memories of my childhood.  I'd invite a couple friends for a sleepover and my parents would drive us straight to the video store to rent a stack of horror movies.  We'd cower under blankets in front of films just like this one until the sun came up and it was a blast.  I'm actually surprised City of the Living Dead didn't make the cut all those years ago, but I'm glad it's around now.

The acting is what it is, and it's what's to be expected, so I'm pushing that to the side.  Not that the acting is bad, but it's not good, either.  (The actor that plays the psychiatrist, however, wins the award for staying the coolest under pressure.  We'll call it the, ""Bob Ross Afro"" award.)  But, yeah...not much going on here.

Where this movies wins is in its special effects and music.  Instead of a swarm of zombies killing scores, the slayings are sparse, but splendidly executed.  I won't elaborate on the methods used as I don't want to ruin it for the few that haven't seen the movie, but if you haven't, get on it.  Wikipedia quotes, ""During the movie, actress Daniela Doria actually vomited sheep entrails during the intestine purging scene.""  Let's assume that's true and move along.

I love the soundtrack.  This, again, probably more so than any other aspect of the film, reverted me back to when I found horror as a child.  Immediately after posting this review, you can bet I'll be doing some online sleuthing to locate the music from this thing.  Great stuff.

Now, there are some pretty massive plot holes that punch through this project once in awhile, but it's nothing to get worked up over.  In the end, it's the zombies that win, and they win hard.  I'd never seen a film where the undead had the abilities of say Michael, Jason, or Freddie, but it happened in Dunwich.  They've not only extraordinary strength, but also house teleportation and levitation skills, as well.  And they're frightening.  Genuinely.  I'd rank them up there with some of the spookiest I've seen, and I've seen a bunch.

I highly recommend this film if you've not yet indulged.  It's brilliant look back at what horror USED to be, and what it hasn't been since.

Enjoy.

898614,5,6304435096,"This is a fulci film if you don't know what that means then probably start with Zombi2 instead.  Fulci is quite an interesting film maker, he tried to make comedies, but when he saw he could make money with giallos and spaghetti westerns he hopped over to those genres (and made some brilliant films), but his break (or fall) happened when he decided to make an unofficial sequel to Dawn of the Dead (Zombi2).  After that he was stuck and only able to get funding for gore films.

So start with Zombi2, if you love that one then proceed, if not then stop, the plot only lessens for more atmosphere and gore (well mainly just gore).  If proceeding then next go to The Beyond, if you like that one then finally venture to this masterpiece (which happens to be my favorite from him).  With this film you have a thin plot which is basically there just build to the next gore moment, but with that being said I think this film is a great atmospheric piece, with a cool soundtrack and of course plenty of gore (including the infamous scene where a girl pucks her guts out, literally).

For a while when we finally rented it the lable said banned/I think it had something to do w/insulting the catholic church & i can see why. A preist,maggots, siances a head being drilled not so nice.
It had some serious WOW FACTOR in its day. The film maker FULCI starred in the film in a small cameo.
When we saw it/The name of the movie was called THE GATES OF HELL\Thats the one that said it was banned & it was finally released after much editing. For in its day there was nothing out like this at all. Which only made ppl want to see it that much more. A cult classic for sure.
How the name got changed i do not know,I do know that it had 9 minutes of cut material that would not make the grade,cuz it was hardcore. So taking that bit out got it released & once popularity of curious horror fans found out about this wild film.
It only gained momentum & its notarity & to watch it today all i can do is admire FULCI's work as he made many ole films.
It has some vulgar parts in it~That in todays time of horror flicks this one would come off cheesey,I still enjoy it, But us that saw it back in the day~This was a different take upon anything that was debuting at the time.

898670,2,6304435096,"Horror films, especially of the zombie variety, are my guilty pleasure.  I rarely stop to analyze exactly why one film works over another - in general, every aspect of a film that I don't like can be present to the same degree in a film that I *do* like.  Except some films just have that je ne sais quoi that others don't.

'City of the Living Dead' does not.  In fact, it is as if someone rooted out any 'special something' that might have developed in this film and stomped it to death.  That's ok - one man's trash is another man's camp, and 'City' may still appeal to certain viewers.  The purpose of this review isn't to put down anyone's taste in films - my argument, besides the fact that I didn't like it, is that I feel this film subtly markets itself as something it's not.

First, 'City' is a mish-mash of an occult film combined with a living dead film.  A priest, for no reason ever given, hangs himself in the tiny village of Dunwich - a town built on the ruins of the Salem of the famous witch trials.  Evidently, this area, because of its history, acts as sort of a nexus, and the priest's actions threaten to open the gates of Hell and spew out its denizens.  A young, attractive medium, during a seance, receives this information, which knocks her into a suspended state so closely resembling death that a funeral is held and she is buried.  A nosy reporter, looking for more clues in the story, visits the graveyard, and in what is probably the best scene of the movie, regardless of how unbelievable, he hears the young woman screaming as she finally wakes inside her half buried coffin, and he rescues her by way of a handy pickaxe some Heckle and Jeckle gravediggers left behind.

From here, the reporter and the medium set off to find the town of Dunwich and stop the spirit of the dead priest from acting as a conduit to Hell.  Meanwhile, the townsfolk of the former Salem, including a psychologist and one of his attractive artist patients, are experiencing a nightmarish plague of attacks from the recently deceased.  Eventually, the two couples meet up and tackle the living dead infestation head-on.

A horror film doesn't have to be intelligent - it never hurts though - and 'City' is pretty weak in the story department.  There's really not enough space to list all the problems in the script, made worse by barely serviceable acting, ineffective effects, and populated by characters that only exist to have their brains exposed onscreen.  All this is pretty typical of low-budget horror though - and I can't fault the film for being what it is.  My problem with the film is more in the small details that made me think the film was something that it isn't.

The director, Lucio Fulci, also gave us the classic 'Zombi' (or Zombie 2, depending on what package you get), a film easily within the top five of that sort of film, so knowing that he also directed 'City' lends this film some credibility that it doesn't deserve.  I assume budget considerations was the biggest hurdle Fulci had to deal with, and it shows - 'Zombi' had interesting locations and cinematography, fantastic second-unit footage, and literally eye-popping special effects. 'City of the Living Dead' just can't compete on any level. (The acting performances were similar.  The audience just has to accept that any movie starring Al Cliver is not going to win any prizes)  The main idea here is that anyone who seeks this film out based solely on Fulci's reputation is very likely going to be disappointed.

Another point to consider is that this film is not really a zombie film, at least not in the sense of Fulci's other film, nor in comparison to Romero's films.  Those films are apocalyptic adventure films with a large helping of horror.  The film poster art (which is excellent for what it is) sort of led me to think that 'City' might be similar - it isn't really.  Taking place in a rural town, it is concerned more with preventing a great evil from happening rather than dealing with the after effects.  As such, it ends up as a 'race against time' film.

'City of the Living Dead' isn't really worth parsing any finer.  It's a very cheap, poorly made film designed to suck money out of the pockets of the drive-in crowd.  With it's new blu-ray release, people may think it was forgotten horror gem.  It isn't.  Best rented first, or better yet, avoided entirely, it is a bad film, which is why I rated it two stars - not because of the intentional or unintentional misleading representation of the film.  Countering that representation was the purpose behind writing the review.",1284249600,5,4590,4.613300492610837
898671,4,6304435096,"I think this film is pretty good. I think it has a creepy mood. I like the moody music of frequent collaborator Fabio Frizzi, who made music for many Fulci films. I like the theme song, but i personally think Fabio overused in the film. At the end of the film, i was a bit tired of hearing that repetitive song. I think it kind of loses it`s effect because it`s just used too much. I also like the Zombie makeup.

Picture Quality: 4/5

Previously i only had the region 1 DVD of this film, and i think this BD look much better than my old DVD. It has a lot of grain, but it is supposed to have that. The grain does not bother me. I think the details and colours are very much improved compared to my DVD.
COTLD was shot on 2-perf 35mm and only using part of the available 35 mm frame, resulting in a loss of overall resolution and detail.

It was not shot on 16mm then blown up to 35mm, as many people think. Yes, some scenes look unclear, but it is not the people doing the restoration`s fault. They looked like that originally in the cinema in 1980. There is some compression artifacts and noise, but it didn`t ruin the film experience for me. I think they did a pretty good job.

Audio Quality: 4/5

I used the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1. The music and the dialog sounds good coming from the Center speaker. The subwoofer channel does not sound like a new film, but i didn`t expect that at all, but there are several times when i hear good bass. Just make sure you have more volume on the sub, compared to newer films.

I was suprised to hear Zombies moaning, the wind and some other effects several times in the rear speakers. I thought the rear speakers would be used much less. I think it sounded good and was surprisingly used for good effect.

If you really like this film and has it on DVD, and was thinking about buying the BD, i would recommend you to buy it. I think it was worth the upgrade.

898672,3,6304435096,"You can tell by the incredibly mixed reviews it garners that this film is, as far as it goes, fairly controversial, and a source of both contentedness and discontent among horror fans. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it turned out to be.

CLD is an Italian/American co-production, having a little something of American narrative coherence (sort of - at least there is a story line to follow, unlike with a fair number of Italian horror flicks) and a lot of the schlockiness of 80's Italian and American horror. The sound track is pretty scary and unnerving (except for some strangely out of place jungle noises), and there are some pretty darn gory scenes of brains being dug out of skulls and intestines being urped up.

Some would give this movie four or even five stars. I guess I'm only giving it three because I'm comparing it to movies like Susperia and The Thing which were made around the same time, and which are far better pics. Still, if you like schlock, gore, creepiness, and / or Christopher George, this film is for you - above average compared to many of its counterparts from that era, and more effective than most horror movies made nowadays. I'm giving nothing away here - promise: the last five seconds are particularly controversial among horror fandom.

It is simply a low bidget, simple classic Zombie movie, don't expect ""Ben Herr"", ""Cleopatra"", ""12 Angry men"", ""Guns of Navarone""...Fulci is a master at what he does, and that create an Italian version of George A. Romero film. He does a fantastic job at that.

As far as people thinking they received the wrong film, I think this might straightne the confussion, or not.

---FULCI Came out with the Italian film (1980) ""Paura nella citta dei morti viventi"" which was press release in the US as ""twilight of the dead"" and then upon US theatrical release as ""The Gates of Hell"" and then finally as ""city of the living dead"" on DVD.
---Bruno MATTEI (another italian film maker) released an Italian film released in the US theatres as (1983) ""night of the zombies"" and then released on DVD in the US as ""Hell of the living dead"".

See the confussion? But wait it gets worse! the cover of each has simlar cover art. Fulci film us an artist who painted the zombie head 1980. Well, in 1983 Mattei also used an artist to create his cover, guess who he used, the same artist. This artist simply added a torso to the head and edited a phote and Boom! we have two very simplar covers which have the same zombia head, 1 sans torso. They also are similar in that they are Zombie film, Italian directors, early 80's, but watch both, the plots are quite different. Matteis film is more Romero like than Fulci's in my opinion.

But overall the films are different and both are fantastic. If you are still confussed, check out Horror Hound issue 23 May/June 2010, there is a hole retrospective and the article is dedicated to the mastery of Fulci and ""city of the living dead"".",1278979200,2,1745,4.495268138801261

 I'm here to tell you, if you already own this movie on DVD, don't waste your money looking for a major upgrade in picture quality.

The picture during the ENTIRE movie looks like it's sparkling - especially during any daytime scene. When it happened during the opening scene, I thought 'maybe a bad reel in the negatives'. But then it went on for the whole running time! It's like an extremely fine pixellation or static going on during the entire film! The picture is very sharp, but it doesn't really matter when it looks like you're watching the movie through a sandstorm. There are maybe a couple of darker scenes that actually look good. It is completely distracting, and almost difficult to watch. It seems like if they went to the trouble of mastering from the original negatives, they could have spent more money to clean it up, or digitally correct the picture.

After watching the movie, I put on the Anchor Bay dvd of this movie to compare. It didn't have the blu ray sharpness, but overall the picture actually looked better, if a little darker.

I am highly dissapointed in this release - there has been much hype about how this one was mastered from the original negatives (even says it on the  box). HorrorHound magazine even gave it a 4 out of 5 for image quality in a recent buyers guide article!

Hopefully, it's just a first run disc mastering error that Blue Underground will fix and replace, but I doubt it.

898728,1,6304435096,"I absolutely love Giallo. But this one seems to fall completely short, like right on it's face before the end of the film.

First off, there is naturally a big build up on the city thing, but to spare you disappointment it doesn't happen. When did twenty zombies that get up off the ground in the last five minutes of film, which suddenly burst into flames and die, become a city?

Also the what heck are up with those ""Zombie-ghosts""? And why does the priest look like one of my stepdad's uncles?

This film is so random it will leave you scratching your head, as it starts out strong and like a jell-o mold squeezing through your fingers, falls apart quickly. But rest assured Gorehounds abound will delight in the gory treats here. One of the best gags is the guy's head in a drill press and the most horrific was the couple making out and the chick pukes up her guts. Seriously, I was bored enough to be enjoying some chocolate chip cookies up until her guts fell out, then I was in Gorehound Heaven and a bit on the woozy side when own stomach turned. Sadly I still miss those cookies.

All in all, it's not Fulci's best and hasn't been since the fall of his career with the sexualized violence of ""New York Ripper"". Unfortunately, it rubbed folks especially women, the wrong way here in the States and it seriously trashed his career. All in all I still love his first film, ""Zombie"" which I feel is still the best.

As for this, it's best to rent not to own.",1252540800,,1465,4.351648351648351
898729,3,6304435096,"Of Fulci's Zombie ""trilogy"", City of the Living Dead (aka Gates of Hell) is usually considered the red headed stepchild of the bunch.  The dialogue is often hilariously bad; the plot is almost nonexistent and the ending is a terrible, tacked on mess.  Still, I like this more than The Beyond or Zombie---mostly because this one lacks the slow spots of those films.  It also, because of its non-linear plot, maintains an effectively illogical and nighmarish tone from start to finish.  And give Christopher George some love here.  Saddled with some uncomfortably bad dialogue, he still makes for a charismatic hero.  That is, until he gets his brains scooped out.  The only thing that bugged me about this is the fact that the zombies are even more of an afterthought here than in the Beyond, with most of the scary set pieces revolving around the reanimated/ghostly Priest.  Also, they are more ""ghosts"" than actual zomibes--with the ability to appear and disappear at random.  Curious also that these ""ghost zombies"" aren't cannibalistic, but instead get their kills in by scooping out the brains of their victims with their hands.",1246838400,3,1132,4.9787234042553195
898730,3,6304435096,"I had originally discovered this film on video under it's more popular guise of ""The Gates of Hell"" and was fairly impressed by it. This was when I was in Junior High and Gore films were one of those things that a younger me was crazy about it. It was probally because it was that sense of rebellion at something that was considered so taboo by everybody else. Italian Horror films were the best at delivering the grueseome goods but most lacked any subtlety and were hardly comparable to the works of a George Romero or David Cronenberg for intellectual Splatter.

So we have this typically ridiculous Lucio Fulci gorefest with atmosphere to spare but it is a missed oppurtunity upon reseeing this a decade later.

The film attempts to tell the story of how a Priest hangs himself and opens up the gateway to hell. A few people including a New York reporter,a psychic and a psychiatrist are the only ones that may be able to avert hell on earth.

Fulci handles the suspense well, generating tension as the race to doomsday commences and he's most effective at allowing his camera to pan among the spooky surroudings.
The first half hour is particularly spooky with the emphasis on the horrors of the mind, the fear of the unknown. The soundtrack is permeated by strange noises, quick unsettling images and strange, violent occurences are happening everywhere. The scene in the bar with the random ghostly occurences are a standout.

Unfortunately, his greatest weakness was always his need for ridiculous, over the top gore that drowns most of the horror he attempts to deliver. Most of the time, the admittebly good effects, appear gratutious and disgusting without actually generating any scares. The film's most infamous scene, the ""drill in the head"" scene is completely pointless and adds NOTHING to the script or the story. Than again neither did the charcater who met that fate!

It probally dosen't help that the script is largely incoherant and burdened by the same awkward dubbing that highlighted most of the Italian Horrors of this period and that the editing is fairly mediocre. The last shot  for example makes absolutely no sense and is bizarre.

Acting is typically melodramatic and lame, though Christopher George tries to evoke a sense of charisma into his role of the reporter who finds a surprise fate towards the conclusion. Most characters are your typical splatter variety of ""arrive and die"" sort and that's a turn off from what could have been a potentially intelligent genre offering.

The score is highly derivative of the one that was used for George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead(1979)"" and while effective, it becomes very glaring for the veteran Horror fan not to notice.

Gore fans will enjoy this immensely and will most likely add a star to the review, but overall despite some creepiness this is mediocre fare. Not nearly as fun as ""Zombie(1980)"" and not intelligent enough to comapre to any of the classic films of the genre, this is purely a curio piece for the gorehound.

Extras on the DVD include Theatrical Trailer, Radio spots and image gallery.",1245715200,4,3085,4.847908745247148
898731,2,6304435096,"I've see a substantial amount of horror movies and love alittle bit of all the genres of horror. I've used amazon as my outlet and source of dvd purchasing for along time and figured I utilize other reviewers input so I thought I'd give some of my own.
I watched Fulci's ZOMBIE first and than went into CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, I usually try to watch a directors work chronologically if possible.  I had high hopes for COTLD assuming it would be an improvement and another level above ZOMBIE, but it failed in comparison.
The plot line in COTLD just bored me and drug on, you don't really even see a zombie until 40 mins into the film. All the Zombie's have the same makeup, so there isn't much creativity there in the makeup deparment. The zombie's despose of each victim in the same manner by grabbing the back of the head and seemingly ripping the scalp and brain out. Don't get me wrong it didn't look bad but theres was only a half a dozen kills and they were all the same fate.  I believe only saw one zombie actually killed.
There was real no character development, I didn't really find myself carrying for anyone in the film at all.
Overall I'd skip this movie check out some other flicks, but if your one of those people like me that just has to see everything check it out. But if you are holding this movie and Fulci's ZOMBIE in your hands the desicion is simple.",1244073600,5,1374,4.342412451361867
898732,3,6304435096,"Remember those Mom & Pop video stores which popped up in almost every shopping center in America during the 80's? The ones that always smelled of popcorn and plastic. I loved roaming the horror aisles of those small shops, you never knew what you would find. One of my discoveries was a flick called ""The Gates of Hell"". It was a great movie full of gore, and starring Christopher George as a cigar chomping newpaper reporter who races to the small town of Dunwich to try and close the gates of Hell. It seems that when a local priest committed suicide, he opened the portal to hell and if left open until All Saint's Day, it could spell the end of humanity.

Well, lo and behold decades later I pick up ""City of the Living Dead"" and it's ""The Gates of Hell"" under an alternative title. The film holds up pretty well. The acting is pretty decent for an Italian B-Movie, the haunting musical score still causes shivers, the film is shot beautifully, and the gore effects have stood the test of time. If you are fan of Italian 80's gore-horror, then you should be pretty pleased with this DVD.

The only thing I would throw out there, is that if you are looking for a ""zombie"" movie, keep looking. This isn't a zombie flick. Sure the living dead are in the film, but look more like ghosts covered in scabs. These aren't the slow moving undead found in a Romero flick, these entities can just sort of appear, grab a hunk of brain, squish it around a little and then disappear just as quickly.

898761,3,6304435096,"When it comes to the films of Lucio Fulci I always say it's an either love it or hate flick. His 70s work might have more appeal to non-fans, but his 80s work are an acquired taste. City of the Living Dead rates as one of Fulci's more popular movies and I agree and disagree.

What I love about Italian filmmakers is their visual style and Lucio Fulci in his prime had a great visual style. He may not be the best of the Italian horror filmmakers, but he knew how to create a creepy vibe. The good points of the flick are the visual look. Lucio Fulci and DP Sergio Salvati created a great and very creepy look to the film. Most of my favorite Fulci movies are the ones with Sergio Salvati. The two really knew how to create a great look.

If you know your Italian horror you should know most of the cast members. When you recognize them from several other movies you know you've seen on too many of these kinda flicks.

The screenplay was written by Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti and the problem is it suffers from any lack of direction. Fulci may have started out as a serious filmmaker, but once the 80s rolled around lets face it his flicks were often incoherent and never really made much sense; despite that some of them were still fun flicks.

It almost seems like Fulci and Sacchetti sat in a room and just thought of some cool scenes and just put them into the movie. It also seems like they were writing two different movies. I'm a big fan of both Fulci and Sacchetti. Dardano Sacchetti wrote numerous cult classics back in the 70s and 80s. He did a lot for the genre.

But it really does feel like two movies were being written and turned into one. While this is a zombie movie it's actually more of a ghost movie than anything else.  Windows shatter and blood pours down, walls split in two, zombies appear in a blink of an eye and in another blink of the eye they are gone. One scene has what seems like thousands of maggots (though one character calls them worms) come flying into a house.

The zombies also seem to have some kinda supernatural power; by making direct eye contact with them, well let's just say it won't end pretty for you. Also we know to kill a zombie give them a headshot. Here by simply stabbing them in the stomach will get the job done. If you are looking for any logic, well you won't find that in City of the Living Dead. Simply put the movie doesn't make any sense at all due to the fact we never get an explanation for anything that happens.

That's why I said it seems like Fulci and Sacchetti just threw together a bunch of random scenes they thought we be cool to see on the screen. That is what hurts the movie at times. While I wouldn't say City of the Living Dead was a scary movie it did have a creepy vibe going for it. The look of the movie was excellent and Fulci used his location to perfection, so through out the movie Fulci does manage to build some tension due to that and quite honestly makes the movie better than it should have been.

But when a bunch of random things just happen with not a single explanation for why I personally felt it took away from some of the tension I just feel this movie lacked due to nothing be explained at all. From Fulci's golden era as much as I enjoy this one it would probably be my least favorite from his 79-84 films.

This is a 80s Fulci movie so one thing you can expect is gore. While not the bloodbath it's often described as it does feature some extreme gore. The girl who vomits her insides was rather brutal. I have seen so many movies like this and some even gorier, but there is just something about that scene that always gets me.

There aren't actually a lot of gore scenes through out the movie that is why I don't see it as the bloodbath people make it out to be. When it comes time for the gore Fulci will deliver. But the one thing that takes away from the gore is it's pretty much the same thing done over. A zombie grabs the back of somebody's head and pulls a chunk of it off. Cool F/X for sure, but it's done like 3 times and doesn't really work as well after the first. There might be some stretches without any gore, but when it arrives it's almost always pretty damn cool.

Granted my review may sound more negative than positive, but despite the flaws I did find myself enjoying the movie overall. City of the Living Dead is slow in some spots and personally there were too many off camera kills. About 5 happened off camera, which is ok sometimes, but a movie like this does need to show more than it did.

But despite the negatives City of the Living Dead is a fun movie for the most part. It has a great creepy feel to it and even though the lack of explanation at times hurts it does help at times. Like the characters, you have no idea what's happening and you have no idea what will come next.

So the lack of the logic does help in certain areas, but personally I see it more as a flaw. We don't need a massive explanation, but just a little would have been nice. While the characters might lack depth, they are actually fairly interesting and likeable. So despite the slowness of the movie the characters are well-done and sort of make up for the slow pace.

City of the Living Dead is quite a fun movie and fans of Lucio Fulci I'm sure will find plenty of good here like I did. I don't think this one is as solid as some of his other work, but it's still a fun ride. If you haven't enjoyed Fulci's work I very much doubt this one will change your mind.

In closing, City of the Living Dead might suffer from feeling like two movies mixed together and the lack of any logic does hurt, but we also get a movie that has a great creepy vibe and some tension due to the visual look. Solid flick, but not great.",1192579200,4,5735,4.204731574158326

Lousy zombie make-up, lousy photography, lousy acting, lousy music, poor dubbing, barely coherent story.  I just don't understand what people like about this movie. Yeah so there's one actress who spews sheep's guts out her mouth for gore effect.  And there's a totally pointless scene where some dude gets murdered by having a drill go right through his head.  And in another scene some chick starts crying blood tears.

At the beginning of the movie a priest hangs himself and this is supposed to somehow unlock the doors of Hell in some small New England town (which we never really get to see due to the ultra-limited budget) which  is supposed to be populated by people who are descendants of those who murdered alleged witches during the Salem witch trials.  But this plot point is never really developed, and instead the film is just a string of meaningless deaths and unconvincing gore.

For some unexplained reason, these bargain-basement quality zombies have the ability to teleport from place to place in the blink of an eye.  Did the director intend this to be some kind of ""deep"" symbolism only Europeans can understand or what?  For me it just made these el cheapo looking zombies even more ridiculous and unbelievable.  And do these zombies want to eat people? Nope, just pull off the backs of their heads. -- Say what?  (I'm guessing it was probably the only decent gore effect the untalented special effects department could pull off on their shoestring budget.)

A typical scene in the movie runs something like this: Dead priest teleports in, hanging from the noose.  Chick screams.  He teleports out of the noose.  Close-up of his face lit with blue lights.  Ooh, SCA~RY!  More of the chick screaming.  Cheap, fake-looking zombie pops in out of nowhere.  Cut to pointless unrealistic gore scene.  And on to the next murder, yadda-yadda....

I know there must be some good zombie movies out there, but this certainly isn't one of them.

One of the best zombie movies of all time? Hah, not a chance!",1180742400,3,2223,4.7591623036649215

898805,1,6304435096,"This movie is horrible. There is not a saving grace about it. Lucio Fulci is the worst of the Italian sub-genre directors and that is not saying much seeing as how the vast majority of Italian horror filmmakers seem to know only one language, violence... extreme violence.

The film opens up with a priest hanging himself in a town that I presume is in New England, and I live in New England, and trust me we do not all act the idiots in this film. Apparently the Italian image of New England is a bunch of inbred hicks.  Now back to the topic at hand. Apparently a hanged New England priest lets loose the last gate of Hell, how he does this is beyond me, but I am assured by the fifteen times that they say it.

A couple, which consist of a reporter and a police officer, go up to investigate the occurrence after a young women is buried alive (dead, but the undead... get it?) and talks about the strange inbred New England town. What happens next is all a blur to me. Something about zombies followed by insipid dialogue and then some more talk about zombies, followed by even more stupid dialogue, then a guy gets a drill in the head. Curtains.

While I am in the midst of trashing this movie I might as well bring up the zombies. These aren't your ordinary zombies, oh no, these are zombies that have the capabilities to transport from one place to another in a split second, whether or not this is intentional is beyond me. Another odd thing is, for some reason, they aren't interested in eating their victims. Rather, they enjoy pulling the backs of their heads off... you read that right, pulling the backs of their heads off. It is as weird as it sounds.

I don't remember how it ends (and I watched it only a half hour ago) and nor do I care. You will not care either. Not even a graduated gorehound like myself can enjoy this garbage. Do NOT watch this film. Ever. Sticking your money in your fireplace is better use of it then giving Lucio Fulci's estate anymore.",1176163200,4,1976,4.358695652173913

Lucio was most popular for his horror grindhouse movies like The Beyond, House By the Cementary, A Cat in the Brain, A Lizard in a Women's Skin, House of Clocks, the New York Ripper, Don't Torture a Duckling, The Psychic, City of the Living Dead, and Zombie, etc. What people don't know is that he directed well over 50 movies. He directed comedy, Italian westerns, dramas, trillers, giallos, and of course horror movies. So don't even compare Lucio Fulci to George Romero because George is nothing compared to Lucio. George always directs some type of zombie horror movie and hardly anything else. Also, Italian movies back in the day don't rely on plot when directing a movie. Asian movies are like that too. Americans need to go educate themselves before dissing foreign films as this or that. Please know something before you criticize something.

898811,3,6304435096,"I usually hate Fulci's work (in fact, some of his films I truly despise, like Cat in the Brain and New York Ripper), but I had never seen this one in its uncut, letterboxed version.  I had seen the VHS copy when the film was retitled The Gates of Hell, but that wasn't letterboxed and was cut for American release.

It was good to see the film in its original form.

This film is no masterpiece, but it's generally a cut above Fulci's other work.  The dialogue is unbelievably bad, the acting is atrocious (Fulci does a cameo like he did in other films of his, and he actually gives the best performance in the film), some of the motivations of the characters are laughable, but the film has a cool nightmare quality to it.  The final third of the film is very effective, as it has hardly any dialogue and you can concentrate on the visuals, which are quite good for a low budget Italian horror film like this.  City of the Living Dead also contains some of Fulci's most famous/infamous gore scenes ever, including the ""drill to the head"" scene and the ""puking scene"".  Both are unsettling and visceral as hell.  Fulci also draws out the tension to an extreme degree (especially in the drill scene).

If you're interested in Fulci, rent this one and Zombie.  They are his best films.  Fulci is not a genius (as many of his followers claim), but he could occasionally could make some decent films.",1161129600,,1396,4.478260869565218
898812,1,6304435096,"Last night I watched The Gates of Hell, aka City of the Living Dead. It's an Italian horror flick made by Lucio Fulci. Fulci may be best known for his movie Zombie! in which an eyeball is pierced in slow-motion by a sliver of wood, and in which a zombie battles a great white shark (with predictable results). Personally, I find Fulci's movies confusing, boring (aside from a few key scenes), and just plain bad. The cut scenes are abrupt and often make no sense. The ""good"" scenes in The Gates of Hell include a drill press to Bob's head, and a teenager puking up all her internal organs. The movie is set in New England, which makes the recurring howler monkey sound effects entertaining. And when the dead all awaken, the sound effect is of crinkling cellophane layered over howler monkeys, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

898834,1,6304435096,"I am a lifelong fan of horror films, so I can overlook a lot when it comes to acting and plot. I take these films with a large grain of salt and hold them to different standards than I would a mainstream film. Some horror films, like The Exorcist, The Changeling, The Others, The Omen, The Ring, Rosemary's Baby, and the works of Mario Bava or Terence Fisher can still give you a chill or two while being very well made. Others are simply B-movies, and all Italian horror falls into this category. Most giallos are nothing more than senseless slices of sex and gore drenched in style, and watched for fun.

Even measured by these standards, this film is simply abysmal. Fulci has always been an overrated hack, and this is a bad film even for him. The plot concerns a priest who commits suicide and opens the gates of hell in a small town called Dunwich. This leads to a plague of zombies who like to appear and disappear at will, tear off scalps, and devour their victims (mostly off camera). A reporter and a sexy psychic head to Dunwich to investigate and head off impending disaster.

Janet Agren, Fulci staple Catriona MacColl, and a sadly underused Daniela Doria head up a cast of impressively beautiful women that will light a fire under any fan of Eurosleaze. Christopher George acts with his cigar and cocky grin, and the rest of the cast goes through the motions, encumbered by awful dialogue and dubbing. You never really care about any of the characters, and the ghostly priest is mildly creepy but his gimmicky random appearances and complete lack of background rob him of any scary presence he might have had.

I first saw this film back in 1985 on a VHS copy with its original US title, The Gates of Hell. Back then, it seemed okay, and I eagerly snapped up Anchor Bay's uncut DVD for my collection, but the old magic is gone. I really wanted to like this film, but it's plagued by a laundry list of flaws. The plot starts out muddled and gets more so as the film progresses. Even in a genre known for numbingly bad scripts and dim-witted protagonists, this film stands out. Early in the film, the female lead is presumed dead, buried alive, and later awakens in her casket. A few minutes later, a scene set in the same funeral home shows an embalming machine at work. Why they didn't use it on her is anyone's guess, but it serves as an example of how the script blatantly flies in the face of common sense to advance the plot.

The makeup and effects are weak and spare, especially compared to Fulci's own Zombie. Gianetto DeRossi was never the equal of a Smith, Savini, Baker, or KNB, but his work here is among the worst of his career. The titular zombies are more slimy and syrupy than mouldering. The film's two infamous gore scenes are a well done head drilling and a scene where a girl vomits out her internal organs. This second scene starts out well enough, but then goes so over the top that it provokes a sigh instead of shock or revulsion. It simply looks too fake to work. The rest of the effects in this film are much the same: closeups of maggots, sheep entrails, and rubbery looking brains drenched in corn syrup and stage blood so ridiculously bright red that it reminds one of the early days of Technicolor.

This is not a true zombie film, so gorehounds who are expecting plenty of gut munching will be disappointed. A few corpses are eaten off-camera, but for the most part, zombies do not appear in this film until the closing minutes, and they are lame indeed. These scenes are made worse by Fabio Frizzi's synth-heavy soundtrack, which is adequate throughout most of the film but makes the final scenes more cheesy than suspenseful.

Finally, City of the Living Dead is hard to enjoy even as a pure horror film because of Fulci's ""one step forward and two steps back"" direction and pacing. Fulci does achieve some nice atmospheric moments with shots of the eerie, fogswept town but the choppy editing ensures that nothing ever resonates with the viewer. Some of the closeups would make Sergio Leone wince, and the overall pace is glacial despite the last third of the film feeling rushed and unfinished. Everything slowly builds to a weak and unsatisfying finale capped by a tacked-on ending that makes no sense whatsoever.

Some solid ingredients are here, including a sly cameo by budding Italian horror director Michele Soavi, but they just don't gel in a satisfactory way. CotLD might be amusing if it didn't take itself so seriously, but Fulci plays it straight and this approach just magnifies the flaws. This film is a plodding, incoherent mess that will have you rolling your eyes as you reach for the fast forward button. Not as painfully bad as Conquest, but far from Zombie and The Beyond, this one is for Fulci completists only.",1156118400,7,4779,4.5889929742388755
898835,4,6304435096,"In the tiny New England town of Dunwich, site of the notorious Salem witch hunts, a priest with red-rimmed eyes inexplicably hangs himself over a graveyard, thus causing the Gates of Hell to be torn asunder. In New York City, lovely psychic Mary Woodhouse (Catriona MacColl) has a vision of the suicided priest and what it portents and promptly keels over dead. Back in Dunwich, strange events begin to spook the locals - oddities such as mirrors shattering, walls cracking, corpses vanishing and reappearing, annoying kids being named John John... Gerry (Carlo De Mejo), a therapist, at first thinks nothing supernatural is at work, but craziness at the home of his patient Sandra (Janet Agren) soon changes his mind.

Some SPOILERS now...

In the Big Apple, reporter Peter Bell (Christopher George) noses around a cemetery and discovers that the buried content of a coffin wants out. It turns out that psychic Mary Woodhouse was deemed prematurely deceased. Now that she's back, she tells Peter that in three days, on All Saints' Day, the dead will rise and walk, unless the portals of Hell are resealed. So off they go to Dunwich. In that dusty, desolate tiny town, Peter, Mary, Gerry, and Sandra will face something unspeakably evil, evil that intends to usher in eternal damnation on our world.

City of the Living Dead (aka The Gates of Hell) starts off well, laying down a pervasive, disquieting mood right off the bat. In the opening moments, there is a promising shot of the camera panning past the priest's forlorn figure and focusing on the words etched on a cemetery tombstone: ""The soul that pines for eternity shall outspan death. You, dweller of the Twilight Void, come."" That is a creepy epitaph, and it sent shivers of anticipation up my spine.

The acting isn't so bad, although the performaces aren't helped by the hokey, stilted dialogue. I thought Chris George was the best thespian here, though I got a kick out of the lovely Catriona shrieking her head off. The plot has holes and tends to meander. Flaws? A little backstory on Father Thomas would've been appreciated. What exactly is the point of Bob? And what's up with the ending? Lucio Fulci ends things with our leads screaming at something we can't see.

One cannot deny Fulci's masterful staging of foreboding atmosphere and escalating terror. He executes this with suggestive camera shots, a senses-jangling synth-rock score, and with gore, gore, gore (and gore). He delivers several sicko moments which, back when this film first came out, had the movie-going kids talking in awed, hushed tones. Scoring high on the Visceral Thrills Meter are the girl spewing out her icky internal organs and Giovanni Lombardo Radice getting his dome drilled in, with Catriona MacColl's buried alive sequence perhaps providing the most harrowing moment of all. And you just know it's not gonna end well when, after some creepy goings-on at a house, the logical-minded fella tells his frantic female companion, ""...we're gonna take it step by step and search every room in the house."" Dude, don't do that. Never do that. Factor in, too, the sense of disorientation brought about by the gristly undead's knack for teleporting. Faced with a barrage of such overwhelming horror, one character resignedly remarks: ""At this point a good stiff drink is the only medicine.""",1154217600,3,3331,4.973070017953321

Natrually, this opens up the Seven Gates of Hell and Dunwich finds itself on the verge of being overun by the dead returned to vengeful life.  Cynical reporter Christopher George and psychic Catriona MacColl both head up to Dunwich to close the Gates but by the time they reach the town, the dead are already walking the streets and graphically ripping out the brains of their living victims.

Though it may not be clear from the above synopsis, City of the Living Dead is actually a better-than-average example of an Italian zombie film.  While it has the over-the-top gore and occasionally incoherent plot that distinguished Italian horror films from other movies produced in the early '80s, City of the Living Dead is also a skillfully directed, occasionally suspenseful film that manages a few true scares along with the expected shock effects.  Though his films are definitely not for everybody, Lucio Fulci was always one of the better directors working in the Italian horror genre and, in City of the Living Dead, he manages to create a truly ominous and mysterious atmosphere and some the images he provides are truly haunting.  (The dead priest, especially, is a disturbing, nightmarish creation.)  As well, even with the atrocious dubbing, the acting is better than what one might expect from an Italian zombie film.  Christopher George wanders through the film with the same shellshocked expression that all semi-established American actors seemed to get when they appeared in an Italian horror film but it actually work rather well for his character.  MacColl was probably one of the most appealing actresses to appear in these films and, whether running from zombies or accidentally getting buried alive (and nearly getting killed when George uses a pickaxe to rescue her), MacColl is never less than convincing in City of the Living Dead.  Her appealing performance makes some of the film's plot holes go down a bit easier.  Fans of the genre will spot plenty of familiar faces in the supporting cast.  Daniela Doria and Michele Saovi have a good scene where they are confronted by the dead priest while Janet Agren, playing a neurotic, is almost as likeable as MacColl.  Perhaps best of all, this film features the debut (and first operatically over-the-top death scene) of Giovanni Lombardo Radice, the Steve Buscemi of Italian horror films.  Here, Radice is Bob, a strangely likeable pervert who has a bad encounter with a power drill and then comes back to seek a suitable revenge.

Obviously, City of the Living Dead is not for all tastes but as an introduction to both Italian horror films and Lucio Fulci, it's an excellent selection.",1139961600,,2724,4.9823399558498895

But the one that I really liked was a girl crying blood then puking her insides up. That effect made the movie memorable.

It's just too bad the plot seemed like it was written by a kid in elementary school on Halloween and sparked bits here and there that looked like he had help from someone older.

898856,2,6304435096,"Wow, this is a really weak Zombie Movie.  City of the Living Dead (also known as The Gates of Hell) has an interesting small plot, a Priest hangs himself in a cemetery and that opens up the Gates of Hell giving everyone three days before the town is overrun with zombies.  There were several, several flaws within the movie.  This was my first Lucio Fulci film and after all the hype, I'm extremely let down, however I am willing to give this Italian Director another chance and rent his Zombi 2 movie.  Alright here are the flaws Zombie Movies have to be really gory and with the exception of two really, really cool scenes, it's mostly stale and cheesy.  The music, oh god, the music.  It's horrible 80's drum machine stuff that is constantly playing throughout the movie and is the same few things over and over.  I almost fell asleep during this movie, it was so slow.  Now granted, I was watching this movie at midnight but I usually stay up at night really late and it shouldn't have fazed me.  The acting isn't that great either, but then again most zombie films aren't.  But the main problem is that Zombie movies are supposed to be grabbing (no pun intended) and interesting.  This film was just plain boring.  I'm going to give this film two stars because the plot had potential and because of the two gore scenes which are outstanding.  One is a scene where a woman's eyes fill with blood after looking into the eyes of the ghost of the priest, and then becomes locked in a trance while she pukes up all her intestines.  The second seems random when an angry father pushes a kid's head into a drill.  That second scene really freaked me out and was done wonderfully, though unfair to the character.  Well not a good Zombie movie, I would instead recommend the classics like Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead and Dead Alive instead.

898858,4,6304435096,"Normally I wouldn't bother re-reviewing a film unless there's some new release or something, but watching this again, I see that it's grown on me quite a bit.  Overall, the hokiness reigns supreme in the supposedly horrific scenes, but the rest of the movie is more effective than I recalled.  What can I say, when it comes to creating atmosphere in a horror film, I'm easy to please.  And even though it tears it all down with inevitable silliness, that's fun too.

This film is most famous for 2 particular gore scenes, and they do not fail to impress. The gut-vomiting scene is the funner of the two. It starts out pretty creepy, as she just bleeds from the eyes, moves to the odd as red-goo encrusted organs protrude out of her mouth, and heads over to the the hilarious as said organs start spewing out of her mouth at a truly spectacular rate. The headdrilling scene, which never sounded all that interesting to me, is quite good too. It's surprisingly realistic by Fulci standards, and puts any other effect in the film to shame in this aspect.(Though this isn't much of a compliment) The most disturbing part, however, is just before the drilling actually starts, as it briefly looks as though the drill is going to enter through his eye.(If that had happened that woulda been pretty senselessly reiterative, but itta still worked.) Sadly, there really isn't much gore other than this, and none of it is any good.  Mostly ya just have the zombies rippin the backs of people's heads off, an effect as lame in execution as it is in theory.

So, you may ask, what about plot, dialogue, characterization and acting? Simply put, they all suck, even by the standards of low-budget horror. Well actually, the acting is fairly average, but the plot is particularly meandering and pointless, as is the dialogue. It is pretty effectively atmospheric a lot of the time. The foggy, windswept town at the end is pretty creepy, as is the climax down in some catacombs. Also, the scene where MacColl's character is nearly killed as she is freed from her premature grave, is very nice too. It also uses some funeral home locales (perhaps inspired by Phantasm?) to reasonably good effect.  Like I said, when nothing is going on, this movie's got a nice horror movie feel to it. Still, the actual horror scenes tend to let it down, even if they're, again, amusing in their own way.

The problems in the horror scenes primarily come down to 3 recurring motifs: head ripping, teleporting and spell-casting.  The first two things are funny because they're executed with remarkable ineptness.  Again, the head-ripping effects are simply terrible.  The teleporting is even worse, as it is done via jerky editing techniques. (i.e. you use the same shot twice, once with the zombie their, once not, so you can just have it spontaneously disappear in a single frame.)  This is even sillier and more amusing than you'd anticipate.  Finally, the zombie spellcasting is funny mainly in the way that it shows that it's happening.  Ya see the way Fulci shows us that the zombie is enchanting someone is he slowly zooms in on the zombies face, than cuts to the enchantees face for just a sec, and than does it again, and again, and again.  This is just extremely silly, and he does it several times.  Again, all of these effects is amusing in a camp way, but I think the most of the rest of the movie actually works pretty well on a normal level.

People tend to call this a zombie movie, but I think I have to take issue with that.(This is not inherently a criticism, just an observation) The undead corpses look more or less like zombies, but they almost never behave like them. Typically they don't even walk, just stand around bolt-upright allowing for occasionally creepy closeups of their blank, dead faces, and then teleport, seemingly at random.  Also, they tend to attack via enchantment or the aforementioned skull-ripping, neither of which strike me as terribly zombie-esque techniques. Late in the film there are some fairly conventional zombies, but they only appear fairly briefly.

Fulci's quirks tend not to bother me as much as some people, but there's some rather unfortunate stuff here. The jagged editing is more prominent than in the other films I've see from him, and, more significantly, he uses countless thousands of shots of people's eyes, occasionally in such rapid and repeated succession that it has an unintenionally comic effect.  Still, it's got some fairly nice cinematography and set design. The music, however, is another highpoint. In the Italian horror films I've seen I'm typically treated to either a Goblin soundtrack, or a Goblin-esque soundtrack. We have the latter here, done by Fabio Frizzi.  Goblin gets all the attention, but I think Frizzi's best work matches anything I've heard from them.  His score is particularly key in the final sequence, where it manages to create a decidedly oppressive mood, in spite of the silliness that preceded it.

Definitely worth a look, but don't be expecting too much on the gore front aside from the two scenes, nor a consistent mood.  Most people can only take this as a camp film, as I did initially, but it's pretty fun in that way too.  Still, it's mostly just a nice practice run for `The Beyond', which would cut down on the hokiness a fair bit more, and have even nicer atmosphere and visual style.

P.S. For all the truly pertinent information, I suggest you look up Stanley Runk's review. It'll tell you pretty much all you need to know to know if you really wanna see this or not.

At this point it was rather disappointing for there is nothing like that in the movie. But there are many things familiar to Lucio Fulci fans: creepy and monotonous music, rather slow action, some gruesome close-ups and so on. If you really enjoy Fulci's films you'll enjoy this one too although maestro had much better - ""House by the Cemetery"", ""The Beyond"", ""Cat in the Brain"" for example. But ""City..."" was shot in the most creative period of Fulci's career so you'll easy put it at the end of the line of his best works. It's not bad at all, besides it has an infamous scene of intestines-puking which every gorehound I guess would want to have in his collection.

898863,5,6304435096,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""The Beyond,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Uncle Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a good director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography.

""The Gates of Hell"" aka ""City of the Living Dead,"" however, is one of the good ones; a gore soaked classic that finds Fulci at the height of his powers. It's a mess of a film about a bunch of unfortunate souls mixed up in the strange goings on in a little town called Dunwich. As we learn in the opening sequences of the movie, a priest hangs himself in a cemetery and, either willingly or unwillingly, opens a portal to Lucifer's lair. At the same time, a sance in New York City causes Mary Woodhouse (Italian exploitation veteran Catriona MacColl) to learn of the priest's horrific action. She screams repeatedly and then promptly dies. When the cops show up to sort out the mess, flames shoot out of the floor and the psychic in charge of the sance launches into some arcane hokum about a certain ancient tome, the Book of Eibon, and the danger it presents to humanity. A reporter by the name of Peter Bell (Christopher George) also arrives on the scene hoping to grab the scoop of a lifetime only to find the cops closemouthed about the nonsense going on in the apartment. Stymied, he heads off to the cemetery to see Mary's grave--those funerals sure take place fast in the Big Apple--only to discover that Woodhouse is very much alive.

In Dunwich, strange events start popping up with frightening regularity. A mirror shatters and a wall cracks in half at a local tavern, scaring the bejeezus out of the town drunks. Local shrink Gerry (Carlo De Mejo) soon finds himself caught up in events when a few members of the tin foil helmet brigade show up and start rambling about the dead rising from the grave. Of course, he thinks they're nuts at first until people start disappearing. A couple of kids out for a night of smooching run into the deceased priest in a scene you'll never forget, and a few other wretches meet nasty ends as we learn that, indeed, the dead seem to have risen for a quick stroll. Not only are they tearing the living to shreds, they also can pop in and out of reality at the drop of a hat, spray clouds of maggots through windows, and generally make a real nuisance out of themselves. By the time Bell and Woodhouse arrive on the scene to join forces with Gerry, Dunwich is about to burst at the seams. Oh, I almost forgot: a local weirdo named Bob (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) runs around trying to avoid taking the blame for the disappearances. The movie ends on a completely pointless note.

Pointless might be the best word to describe this Fulci outing, since the plot is as thin as an onionskin, but ""City of the Living Dead"" is one of his most notable films. Thanks to an atmosphere of pervasive doom so thick you could cut it with a knife and gore ramped up to levels that stagger the imagination, this movie is a must see for the diehard horror fan. Truly, Fulci outdid himself with this nihilistic picture. Two of the gore scenes in particular, the drill bit through the head and the notoriously grotesque gut puke (called ""The Devil's Spew"" on the chapter selection!) will leave you gasping for breath. Heck, this movie even sports a couple of nifty scenes where people start bleeding from the eyes! Oh yeah! It's great, chunk blowing fun that requires multiple viewings to take it all in. The rest of the film might make you wince as well, but for different reasons. Fulci's famous eye zooms are here in full force, as is an annoying kid character by the name of John-John whose participation in the idiotic conclusion should require a doctoral dissertation to discern its meaning. Too, the dialogue and acting generally tank. But who cares when you've got gore spraying across the screen every five minutes?

I'm quite the fan of this film as it was one of the first Italian gore opuses I watched back in the day, so it's disappointing to see such a bare bones DVD presentation. A trailer, several radio spots accompanied by stills, and a Fulci biography constitute the sum total of the supplements. Then again, maybe I'm being a tad nitpicky. The violence is so over the top that anything we see in the film pretty much speaks for itself. It should go without saying that you can't begin to call yourself knowledgeable about Eurotrash cinema without having seen this film. Run, don't walk, to get a copy. You won't be disappointed.",1115856000,16,5487,4.539393939393939
898864,3,6304435096,"Another great Fulci film. As is the usual with his movies, this one is both oddly paced and loaded with abundant gore! ""City of the Living Dead"" was creepy, eerie, and actually made a bit more sense than many Fulci films do.

While many critics and casual horror fans looking for a great story may find this film to be a piece of dreck, Fulci fans will find it to be satisfying and many find it to be one of his best efforts.

As for the gore, some of these death scenes are among the most genuinely sickening images in zombie history, including one of the most disgusting scenes I believe I've ever witnessed (made me feel a bit nauseated myself and that never happens).

Again before you go into this film, know what your getting yourself into. If you love typical 80's cheesy Italian Zombie movies than you'll love this. If your used to American teenage slasher flicks such as ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" then perhaps this is not for you. All in all ""City of the Living Dead"" is worth an evening.

I could point out errors in just about any movie but I choose to watch them for entertainment. I am not studying these movies for some Fine Arts final.

There is plenty to enjoy about ""City Of The Living Dead"". The drill scene is one of the most graphic of its type ever filmed and no one can do gut spewing quite like Fulci.

898886,4,6304435096,"Some movies are made to make a statement, others are made to entertain and then some are made to make you sick. Enter CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD. If ever there was a B movie with a working plot CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD is it, sort of.

This feature length film, written and directed by Lucio Fulci, is about a group of people who dodge killer zombies in an attempt to close the GATES OF HELL (VHS version title of same movie), which have been opened on purpose. The film begins with the local priest, Father Thomas, committing suicide by hanging himself above a grave and thus opening the ill reputed gates. The act is witnessed by a girl who happens to be several hundred miles away attending a seance. The plot is a little silly, but this was filmed in 1980 on a low budget.

As this horror flick drags itself merrily along, we come to chapter eight ""the devil's spew,"" where we find Rose and Tommy making out at the cemetary right smack in front of the grave where Father Thomas offed himself. The dead priest appears in the headlights and causes Rose to cry blood and vomit her internal organs into her lap while Tommy looks on in terror, gagging.

After several minutes of boring dialogue, we come to chapter 17 ""the drill"" where Bob, the local weird guy, smokes pot in the back seat of Anne's car. He gets caught by Anne's father who suspects Bob of foul play, or fouly playing, with Anne and promptly pushes Bob's head onto the ol' drill press and .  .  .

Although I didn't find this film to be horrifying or even scary, with lines such as ""she was like dead...and she was eating mommy and daddy,"" I did find it entertaining in a twisted sort of way. And though the acting, special effect, filming and sound effect straight from the old Scooby Doo episodes are poorly done, these qualities only add to the films constant creepiness.

No no, this won't be shown on movie night with the church youth group but it's a good ""popcorn and a movie at home"" alternative to boredom. Or maybe you just like creepy, cheesy horror.",1103673600,3,2023,4.393048128342246

898891,2,6304435096,"I thought of giving this movie three stars. I have watched it several times and enjoyed most of it; however it seriously falls apart within the last twenty minutes. 'City of the Living Dead' begins with a suicide scene which takes place simultaneously with a seance. There is a connection between both events; one sets off a malefic chain of events; the other, a premonition of these events through a state of consciousness known as death. The latter leads the way for the premature burial scene which is so well done (who knew a pickaxe was standard equipment for rescuing someone from a coffin). The mood and atmosphere are pumped into scene after scene. You know things are going to get nasty when John Morghen makes an appearance on screen (and I must personally protest naming the town freak Bob). Christopher George is Christopher George which is what makes his character so likeable. Catriona MacColl is as always beautiful. MacColl and George are a good pairing for this movie. This is part of what tears me up about this movie that there are so many good aspects of it, yet, in the last 20 minutes it falls apart (some may argue it fell apart before that). One thing that appears to have happened; although I have never read any articles that verify this; is that this movie appears to have had two directors (this would not be the first time Fulci had to leave a project early for other commitments or feuding). In the last 20 minutes of the film the pacing changes and so does the quality of the make-up (apparently Giannetto de Rossi left too). This is not to say that the first 70 minutes of this film are perfect (the priest's appearances do get annoying), but there is a consistentcy to the first 70 minutes that is lacking in the latter part of the film. Fulci does set a stage of atmosphere and mood. One which reeks of gloom and impending doom. In the eyes of the people of Dunwich you can see depression (make-up helped). But, Christopher George is on his way; can he cut through the depression with his smile; he carries it with him everywhere he goes (I am sorry; I was having a little fun at Christopher's expense). I do wish that someone would do a re-edit of this film, and even add to it if necessary. There are too many good parts to this film to let the last 20 minutes tear it apart, yet, as it exists, I cannot recommend it to other than hardcore fans of Fulci and horor movies.

898906,2,6304435096,"Like Dario Argento, I accidently stumbled upon Lucio Fulci during my countless horror movie searches on AMAZON.COM and reading some of the reviews I decided to purchase some of his films namely ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B0002C9DK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-By-the-Cemetery/dp/B000MV8ZD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House By the Cemetery</a>"" and ""City of the Living Dead"". Being a huge fan of horror movies, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Zombie"" and ""House by the Cemetery"" but I must frankly admit, I was a little disappointed with this one. The films sick reputation is what attracted me to it and although some scenes in the film were just that, the film was no where near as shocking as many other films I have seen and in comparison to others of the Italian/Horror genre, and even Fulci's other films, this was a big let-down.

The weird plot deals with a sinister looking priests unexplained suicide, a cursed town that is constantly draped in a thick grey fog (with jungle animals screeching in the background), a beautiful witch who foresees the end of the word and as the title would suggest, the living dead. The biggest problem I had with the film was with the disappointing make-up effects. In Fulci's epic ""The Beyond"" and his infamous ""Zombie"", the several dozen zombies in those movies were incredible and actually looked like the walking dead. The zombies here did not and looked more like humans dipped in honey and mustard while others looked like they were in the last stages of small pox. Although grotesque it failed to convince me they were the living dead. Their eyes were also too alive. They should of at least given these actors some colored contact lenses. Every time I watch this film, I can't get past the fact that their eyes look as alive, as white (no red) and as vivid as the luminous eyes seen in a VISINE commercial. Another minor annoyance was when the sticky ghouls started performing magic tricks, or to be more specific, disappearing acts. In some scenes, the zombies kept appearing then disappearing then re-appearing and in one scene, a zombie suddenly appears on a railing a good three stories off the ground than jumps off it, lands on his feet (you'd think being dead would have had some impact on his joints) and terrorizes a frighted tormented child. It was an impressive leap but this whole nonsense of having the zombies appear out of nowhere and disappear and perform impressive acrobats kind of changed the atmosphere from a zombie film to a ... ghost story? I still have no idea what they were exactly- zombies, ghosts, zombie-ghosts?

The films strengths lies in a couple of tense scenes. The gut regurgitation scene made me quite nauseous and the head-drilling scene was very well done and convincing. Another highlight was the scene depicting pretty Catriona MacColl trapped in a coffin, screaming and gasping for air and whose fate is only inches away from her rescuers deadly pickaxe. That scene is memorable and a film highlight.

I also have to disagree with some of the reviews about the acting. The acting is no where near as bad as some constantly state and it is my opinion that the acting is far better than it should have been. It's time to give these actors a break as they made the best out of the material they were given and Ms. MacColl proved she can be just as convincing and as loud as any of the ""Scream Queens"" from Hollywood. She is definitely one of the loveliest.

The horror film fans who have not seen this icky Fulci film, it is recommended.  There are plenty of gross out moments and some good performances to make it an interesting view but keep in mind, it is not his best work by far.  For the Fulci curiosity seeker, I recommend starting with something else, either ""Zombie"", ""House by the Cemetery"" or ""The Beyond""- his best work. For those unfamiliar with Euro/Italian-Horror, I suggest you save Fulci for later and start with Dario Argento instead as Fulci's ""in-your-face"" style, gore and obvious nonsensical plot lines may turn the uninitiated off. Argento's films, although bloody and no less convoluted, are handsomely produced and offer an abundance of style. And for those who do not like the genre, then what are you doing reading this review? Just stay clear of Fulci and his entire blood soaked catalogue because you will be repulsed.

And yet, this movie still easily competes against Jeepers Creepers and 28 Days Later, to name but a couple of the newer horror movies.  If you are one of those who has to fill some kind of superiority void within by spotting every flaw in a movie and then smugly pointing it out to those around you doomed to have to listen (or read your review)---put the muppets in, because you will only have an aneurism trying to keep up with the so-called flaws.  For the rest of us who have that magnificent gift of suspending our beliefs for an hour and a half, we will be able to appreciate the feeling of having been put through hell.  Fulci's City of the Living Dead does just that.  If the movie can be said to have any kind of metaphor, it is that Fulci's zombies are merely extensions of the different kinds of human corruption.  How appropriate then that the zombie madness begins with the suicide of a priest, the supposed guardian of other people's faith.  Many of the people who get killed off in the movie are flawed in a significant way, from being malicious, to paranoid, to narcistic and prideful.  Do they deserve it?  Who knows.  One of the most disturbing scenes in the film is of a guy getting his head drilled in---the twist is that it isn't the zombies who drill his head in.  The zombie gore and the musical soundtrack that often propells things are extraordinary.  The music especially conveys a trapped, claustrophic feeling.  The only BIG problem I had was with the ending; I've seen this movie three times, and I still have no clue how the movie ends.  Still, considering how most Italian horror movies unravel themselves and present their respective denouments, this is getting off rather cheaply!",1067126400,3,1838,4.6234567901234565

898911,5,6304435096,"Forget what a bunch of these other reviewers say when they are knocking this ""classic"" work by the late great director, Lucio Fulci. Maybe they aren't fans of the Maestro's work, or for Euro-Horror, or more specifically, Italian Horror, in general. Maybe it's just me, but I loved this film when I first saw it at the theatre with my father, back in the early 80's. Right to the beautiful, restored, uncut edition, released by Anchor Bay. True the vhs transfer is somewhat murky, but the AC dvd is the bomb.
I've been a horror film fanatic since I was 12, and have expanded my horizons into the Euro-Cult gen, now that I am 35.
One reviewer mentioned an Italian Superstar in this movie as Robert Kerman. This is not him, in this picture. It is none other than the great Giovanni Lombardo Radice, (AKA John Morghen) who gets a labotomy, courtesy of a nice machine drill.
The movie does not make much sense, then again, how may Italian, Euro-Cult movies do? But that's the fun of this whole movie.
The acting is lame, the dubbing is atrocious, even the late Christopher George's voice is dubbed, with his own voice, of course. But the movie is a non-stop blood bath, for the most part.
You've probably read the other reviews, how a priest hangs himself, and is witnessed, while in a seance, from a group of modern day witches. By doing this he opens up the ""Gates of Hell"", which must be closed by midnight on ""All Hallows Eve"", (aka Halloween), or the dead will walk the earth, and rule over the living.
 Then in walks the journalist Christopher George, accompanied by the thought dead, beautiful Catriona Macoll, who had witness the hanging of the priest during the seance, and had a heart-failure of sorts, before being discovered alive by George.
Seeing this in her seance & knowing that she must get to this town of ""Dunwich"" before all hallows eve, to close the gates of hell, along go our 2 heros, off to stop the dead from ruling the Earth.
When they finally get to Dunwich, they meet up with another couple, who have noticed strange going ons in this small town. So, George and Miss Macoll explain to them what may be the root of the problem. Unbelievers, they tend to laugh it off, until they can't ignore what's happenng anymore.
Not all of these 4 heros make it out alive. In fact only 2 do. Which 2, you'd have to watch to find out. But it's not exactly the 2 you might think.
This movie is filled, to say the least, with blood, guts, intestines, and gobs-o-gore. One of my personal favorites of the Euro-cult gen, because this is the first movie, little did I know at the time, that would introduce me to the Euro-Cult gen. Not as plot-driven as Fulci's masterpiece, The Beyond"", but still a worthy staple in the Euro-Horror gen.
Italian Cinema, in general, does not have the restrictions that the US has on movies that are distributed over here. So they can go ""all out"", when it comes to the blood-n-gore department. And all out Fulci goes.
I would, without a doubt, recommend this movie to ""any"" gorehound out there. I have seen it on the vhs and the Anchor Bay release, and love this movie, no matter how many times I've seen it. So don't listen to these people knocking this movie, they don't know what they're missing.

898932,2,6304435096,"I originally saw City Of The Living Dead under the Title of The Gates of Hell on a poorly made VHS. Even though the quality was bad, the movie intreged me. The story was very interesting and the film has soom very genuine scary moments. But the film just suffers from very poor editing and plot holes. I don't know if it was just the budget, but the editing is very choppy and the whole film just feels sloppily put together (especially the ending!). The film also has huge plot holes. In one scene, a women is killed in the city of Dunwich in Europe. A couple of scenes later it shows police investigating the murder, but one of the policeman has an american flag on the sleeve of his shirt. But the murder is in Dunwich! Did New York policemen travel to dunwich to investigate the murder? Little things like that insult my intellegance. Lucio Fulci does however give the film a awsome frightening atmosphere with the scenes of Dunwich. The wind is always blowing and there is always a feeling of dread. The atmosphere is so thick, you could cut it with a knife! This is what I like about Fulci's films. He can brillantly give a felling of dread, gloom and doom. What I don't like about his movies is the OVER abundance of gore. There is only so many ""zombies grabbing a head and squashing brains out"" you can take before it gets real old, real fast. The two notorious scenes are the are the gut puking and head drill scenes. I can take the gut puking. Its a good shot to shock the audience, but the head drill scene is a little much. The purpose of this scene is nothing, just to show a head getting drilled. What would have been a supendous horror film gets muddled by poor editing and totally unnessessary scenes to show off gore. Look at Fulci's THE BEYOND for example. Its a good horror film, but most people lose respect for the film because of that spider scene, that runs for like 10 minutes! Show some of it, but Fulci definatly goes overboard, and thats why his films only get a selected audience. Sure I like Fulci, but only in small dosses. City of the Living Dead is worth a view. Not a great film, but has some intesting story elements and some genuin scares.",1052179200,,2174,4.37037037037037

That is to say, I don't even attempt to give these kinds of movies the same critical eye that I would apply to a Kurosawa or a Hitchcock.  The problem is that despite all of this, this film still failed miserably.
The scares in ""City of the Living Dead"" were cheap, the suspense was non-existent, and the characters weren't even remotely developed or interesting.  Even the Fabio Frizzi soundtrack didn't seem to be able to get me interested.  I think Frizzi had done a very nice little job in Fulci's ""Zombie"".
There were really only two redeeming qualities to this film.  The first is the acting.  And don't get me wrong, the acting is still not very good - but it is better than much of the acting we see in these kinds of films.  The other bright side in this film is the special effects.  Hey, we're talking 1980 here, and the special effects really are pretty good.

Its not just about endless violence and gore, theres much more to it. The lighting in this movie got annoying...The soundtrack sounded like Zombie's, but it still had the same haunting qualities.

The film opens well, and fast, and the extremely bad lighting effects for the movie actually kind of help in a way, it just makes it seem kinda dark and brooding. This was a better movie then The Beyond (the same plot pretty much) and Zombie (so-called classic). The one scene with the gut vomiting was done well, the girls eyes, the lighting, the sound effects, actually make it pretty eery. But then it ends and the ""Zombies"" come out to kill ( I put that in quotes just because I believe zombies are supposed to eat people and not dissappear and reappear like magicians). The ending made no sense at all (although I heard on another version it makes more sense) and the way the ""bad guy"" gets killed at the end is just stupid.

Not much of a story. Priest hangs himself and somehow opens up the gates of Hell and zombies slowly begin to squirm out and kill innocent townsfolk. The police nor the victim's families can understand the crime scenes but are sure that Bob, a rumored sex offender, must be the perpetrator of these bizarre deaths. Then a young woman and a reporter set out to find the city where the dead are awakening before All Saints Day, when a whole bunch of zombies will walk.
This movie is a major bore. The music score drags tediously through the death scenes, eliminating the possibility of a legitimate scare. Then the gore is so sloppy, that what many fanatics regard as intensely shocking, is just laughable and ineffective in enducing real nausea. Though, the same can't be said for the performances in the film. I did remember feeling queasy during nearly all dialogue-driven sequences (save some mild inconsequentials with Mary and the washed-up journalist).
To put it bluntly, there is a part of you (all those of you who are sane) who will wish you were being drilled yourself then endure the torture of having to watch this film.

899002,4,6304435096,"I lost count with how many times I covered my mouth watching this brilliant movie written by Lucio Fulci and Darnando Saccehetti * Directed by Lucio Fulci. Many people fail to enjoy it to the extent that I have enjoyed it, and I truly sympathize for them. Here's some of the reasons people hate this movie: Even though the atmosphere was downright eerie, with that old-town haunted feel to it-the light was so scarce, it made it hard to see what you were looking at during many scenes. The blood and guts in this movie was abundant, but sometimes, you can actually tell when models were being used instead of real people. The story-line was bleary and hard to follow-people much rather watch a movie that doesn't involve concentration.
If you think you can bypass these three problems everyone likes to complain about, then prepare yourself for a slow and agonizing ride into Hell. A Priest (which I think was really a Satanist disguised as a Priest) hangs himself in a Cemetery. A group of modern day witches witnessed his suicide while performing a Sance. The Mother witch interprets the vision to be a forewarning of the day when The Gates of Hell will open, and when the dead will dominate the Earth.
Apparently, the Gates were where the original `Salem was, in this Town called Dunwich. The local folk begin to realize, that ever since that Priest hung himself, that strange things began to occur. The winds, for instance, blew furiously, always on the brink of becoming a storm. Store windows break inward for no apparent reason, and house walls split down the middle. People end up missing. Dead bodies on roadsides start floating around, leaving everyone to assume that some killer was on the loose, and naturally they blame this one guy with a bad local reputation. People didn't accept the fact that they were being terrorized by forces exceeding human comprehension, until final it became so dangerous to walk the streets the radio warned everyone to stay inside their houses and keep their doors locked.
The movie starts with a good foot in reality, and slowly you are lifted from that world you have always known and relocated in a place you always thought didn't exist. I felt dizzy and misplaced after watching it. If a film can have that effect, then it's truly a commendable work of art. Try watching it a second time before passing judgement.

899004,3,6304435096,"I first saw an X rated version of this film in the early 1980s when I was in my mid teens.  It was my first 'Fulci' experience and, to some extent, completely re-defined up my notions of what to expect from a horror film.  Fulci's films (and Italian 'splatter films' in general) seemed so much more mean spirited and graphically nasty than any American horror movies I had ever seen (the UK cinema release originaly left all of the gore intact apart from the full head-drilling scene, but with the moral panic over so called 'video nasties' in the mid-eighties, many of the other gore scenes were cut in subsequent video releases). Having watched this film again, uncut, courtesy of Anchorbay's DVD, I must say I am considerably less impressed with the film now.  Sure, it has some great gore scenes, but the film itself seems to revolve around these scenes, rather than having them integrated into a story.  For example, Fulci's Zombies all seem to have a penchant for ripping off the backs of people's heads, for no other reason, it would appear, than because it makes for a good gore scene. The same could be said of the infamous gut-vomiting scene, and it certainly applies to the poor bozo who gets his head drilled by an over protective father!!!!  As a result, Fulci's film only seems to come alive during the gore sequences.  I give this three stars, largely for nostalgia - I became a big Fulci fan in my teens at a time when his name was little known to 'mainstream' cinema goers.  But, Fulci was never really any more than a hack Italian director who found brief fame during the horror film boom of the eighties.  The way he is eulogised now by horror film fans makes me cringe with embarrassment.",1016582400,2,1708,4.577049180327869

You can tell that this film is very low budget. There are like only about 15 people that play in this movie that is supposedly supposed to be in a city. 3 guys hanging out in a bar, only 3 guys in the bar during the day? And on halloween night, you do not see anyone roming around trick or treating, quite strange wouldnt you say? and some of the scares were very funny. Like when the zombies gather around the old man, just walking towards him and staring at him, and how he just stands there scared, not even trying to defend himself.  You just have to see it to believe it. Also the ending didn't make much sense either at all, your like what was that all about? Also I think the dvd couldve had better features on it, like captioning, the original italian language version and more special features. Still its enjoyable to watch, the music on the other hand is quite awesome, especially the slow dark drum beat you keep hearing, the keyboards.  The whole...soundtrack was great.  The acting was farely decent for being dubbed. Still this movie had its moments of scares and fun.

The zombies are a little different this time around. They are slimey and they disappear into thin air when you close your eyes and furrow your brow!!!Yes, there is plenty of gore which one can expect but I did find some black comedy here and there that makes the viewing of CoTLD worthwhile. 1) Grave diggers that like to look at porn more than burying stiffs. 2)Christopher George always looks like he is about to burst into laughter. 3)The denizens at the local bar know something diabolical is happening because a mirror breaks and a wall cracks-almost knocking the Pabst sign off the wall. 4) Michele Soavi (actor, 1st assistant director for TENEBRAE and BARON MUNCHAUSEN, directed STAGEFRIGHT, THE CHURCH, DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE) gets a fist into his cranium. 5) The local mortician paints all of the corpses in a very whorish manner and the mourners don't seem to take notice. 6)Giovanni Radice aka John Morghen, nuff said and finally 7)4 zombies in a town with a population of 10 people can really manage to turn everything upside down.",1015545600,,1429,4.909090909090909

The plot is nothing spectacular (a psychic has a vision of a crazy priest hanging himself that causes the Gates Of Hell to open, and if by All Saint's Day the Gates aren't closed, the Living Dead will take over the Earth), but the movie is pretty entertaining with a good and fun performance by the late great Christopher George, a creepy musical score, and some really nasty gore scenes (the Gut-Spewing scene is a gorehound's dream! And look out for the Head-Drilling and Brain-Ripping scenes, ouch!). Plus the movie has a lot of creepy and intriguing moments, enjoyable characters, and a cool (albeit senseless) finale. The ending is a bummer, but overall the movie itself is pretty good and is worth a watch if your in the mood for some repulsive gore and to be scared silly.",1006905600,2,955,4.558139534883721

Now that I've finally been able to see it again (about 13 years later) I'm happy to say that I still love it. Of course its not as scary as when I first saw it but its pretty good. What I love about this movie is the atmosphere create by Fabio Frizzi's music and the zombies make-up is pretty well made... That Emily zombie is really scary.
also a great thing is that the DVD is uncut :) the version I've saw 13 years ago have cut off all the gore scene... so it was the first time I've ever saw the complete widescreen version of the movie.
Its one of the best Lucio Fulci's movie that I have saw (haven't see them all). I still need to see ""The Beyond"" for the first time and to watch ""zombie"" again (same story here, saw it when I was about 12 and someone dub over the tape)... can't wait till Anchor Bay re-release it.

as for the DVD itself I think Anchor Bay did a great job with this movie. the picture and sound quality is as good as you can get with a movie that have more than 20 years of age... not many extra are available thought... you only get the theatrical trailer, 2 radio spot for the US release with stills pics from the movie & a little Bio about the director Lucio Fulci.

899120,5,6304435096,"Being raised on mainstream horror such as ""Halloween"" and the ""Scream"" trilogy, I was sheltered from the extreme world of Italian horror.  When I first saw ""City of the Living Dead"" (under its U.S. title, ""The Gates of Hell""), I thought it was poorly done, basically because it didn't follow those silly rules of plot and storyline that are so prevalent in American movies.  But after countless viewings I grew to love this movie--if anything, Lucio Fulci was a superior craftsman who would rather have seen the audience draw conclusions about the story rather than meticulously outline every detail.  Yes, I realize his movies were often churned out quickly and time probably didn't allow for a cohesive narrative to be seen through, but this thankfully left a lot to the viewer's imagination.
""City of the Living Dead"" is no exception.  It's about the bizarre events that occur in the tiny town of Dunwich after a priest commits suicide; it turns out one of the gates of hell have been torn open and it's up to a reporter (Christopher George) and a psychic (Catriona MacColl, who also appeared in Fulci's ""The Beyond"" and ""The House by the Cemetery"") to shut them before 'All Saint's Day', after which the dead will rise and walk the earth.  Meanwhile, residents of the town start getting knocked off mysteriously, via brain pullings, intestine vomitings, and--in one spectacular scene--skull drillings.
Yes, it's true that not much of this makes sense, but for the horror fan who resents the mainstream and its shameless marketing of blemish-free teens to sell slasher pics, this is a slice of heaven.  Keep in mind that ""The Beyond""--for some inexplicable reason--is considered, among cult fans, a 'masterpiece' and it doesn't make an iota of sense, either.
""City of the Living Dead"" only deserves to be regarded just as highly because of its unnerving atmosphere, nightmare logic, and outright extremity.  The viewer who is familiar with these types of movies will willingly suspend disbelief, disregard all the loose ends, and wait for the next scare to come.  But for anyone who's looking to get INTO Italian horror, I'd recommend starting with something directed by Dario Argento before working your way up to this.

[Paura nella Citta dei Morti Viventi]

(Italy - 1980)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

By anyone's standards, Lucio Fulci's gruesome potboiler shouldn't rate so much as a second glance: The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is a joke, and the  plot is a meandering grab-bag involving a ghostly priest whose suicide in the obscure town of Dunwich has somehow opened the gates of hell. Don't ask  me why - the script doesn't provide an adequate explanation, so your guess  is as good as mine. Whatever the reason, cue shuffling zombies, oodles of fog, and a bunch of lacklustre 'heroes' (including Christopher George, clearly in it for the money) who barely register as anything other than mouthpieces for the increasingly humdrum scenario. And yet...

And yet, there's something about the movie that makes it almost compulsively watchable. Fulci and cameraman Sergio Salvati transform the Lovecraftian town of Dunwich into a desolate, windswept no-man's-land where isolated citizens are confronted by supernatural events which seem to validate the kind of superstitious bigotry that was initiated in Dunwich's distant past: When a misunderstood simpleton is murdered by an outraged father who mistakenly thinks the boy has been messing with the man's daughter (who's actually far less innocent than he imagines), the script invokes parallels with events of the 17th century when so-called witches were unjustly burned at the stake by irrational townsfolk. In other words, nothing changes, despite the passage of time. This particular murder may seem gratuitous (the victim serves no other purpose in the narrative and his death is immediately forgotten by the scriptwriters), but Fulci uses it to underline  the small-minded bigotry which links the town unequivocably with its own historical past.

Elsewhere, the frequent explosions of hardcore gore will horrify the uninitiated, but Fulci resorts to these crowd-pleasing set-pieces only sparingly, and his over-reliance on mood-setting tableaux is a disappointment. But ""City"" DOES contain what is arguably the finest set-piece of this director's career: George's use of a pickaxe in a desperate attempt to free the lovely Catriona MacColl from a coffin where she's been buried alive. Here, Fulci generates more tension and genuine horror than any other scene in his entire filmography and provides stunning confirmation of his somewhat erratic talent.

By the way, horror fans have been trying for years to decipher the very last scene in the movie, but it defies all attempts to make sense of it. Catriona MacColl believes it was because the director didn't know how to end the film and simply made something up on the spot. So now you know...",964656000,8,2738,5.288018433179723

I won't do this film a disservice by comparing it to any of the  films in the George Romero classic zombie trilogy. I won't even compare it  to the previous Italian release 'ZOMBIE', even though the box artwork and  plot is essentially similar. This is yet another odd release where viewers  must suffer through LOOOONG, tedious sequences running 10-15 minutes with  NOTHING happening, only to have an occasional gory scene suddenly present  itself, repulsing the viewer back to their senses. And what a viewing  experience it is here, people. Let's see -- viewers are subjected to a  running bit where the backs of characters heads are squeezed until brain  matter spurts out (is it even possible to achieve that kind of leverage  using just a human hand?); a woman is forced to vomit up what looks to be  her entire digestive system while remaining conscious; and finally, a young  retarded man is forced, screaming, onto a work bench while an angry  villager runs a huge steel drill bit through the screaming boy's head. Wow,  and all for $? Funny thing is, the characters are all so flatly written  that even these gore scenes fail to generate little interest beyond the  basic lurid technical achievement of it all.
All in all, this is a BAD  movie, filled with endless scenes of boring exposition and lots of scared  looking characters, but little happens, aside from the sadistic gore.

The movie benefits from Fulci's always strong sense of atmosphere and his unsettingly use of odd and exaggerated sound.  Outside of the two notorious gore sequences, there are two other great moments worth watching the movie for...the rescue of the heroine when she is buried alive and the hunting for a here and gone corpse in Sandra's house.
The disc itself is good. The transfer seems sharp and clean, the letterboxed image is nearly complete (some cropping is still visible). The extras are interesting but, for longtime fans of Fulci, nothing new and nothing special.

7873985,4,6304435096,"WARNING SPOILERS!!! During the late-'70s to early-'80s director Lucio Fulci made a series of gore films that are not remembered for their plots but, rather, for their bloody set-pieces. Films such as ZOMBIE (1979), THE BEYOND (1981), THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY (1981), and THE NEW YORK RIPPER (1982) fit that description and so does this film. While it does have a semi-coherent plot, you'll remember this film for the bloody deaths long after the film concludes.
  The film opens up with Father Thomas (Fabrizio Jovine; Fulci's THE PSYCHIC - 1979) walking around a graveyard in the fictional town of Dunwich (actually filmed in Savannah, Georgia). The camera then pans to a tombstone which has this inscription on it: ""The Soul That Pines for Eternity shall outspan Death. You, Dweller of the Twilight Void, come"" and then we watch as the good Father throws a rope around a tree branch and hangs himself. This act of cowardice puts the whole town of Dunwich in deep trouble. While Father Thomas is hanging himself, there is a seance, performed by Mary Woodhouse (Katriona MacColl; THE BEYOND - 1981), going on clear across town. Mary ""sees"" Father Thomas committing suicide and dies of fright (don't worry, this is not the last we will see of Mary or of Father Thomas).
  The police show up to investigate Mary's death and Sgt. Clay (Martin Sorrentino; Fulci's MANHATTAN BABY - 1982) interrogates Theresa (Adelaide Aste), an elderly woman who was at the seance. She tells Sgt. Clay that Mary's death had to do with an ancient black magic text called ""The Book Of Enoch"", which is older than the Bible. She also tells him that the worst is yet to come. Sgt. Clay only believes in what he can touch, but he witnesses flames shoot up from the floor, which should change his mind (But it doesn't. He believes it was a trick performed by the mediums.).
  We then see town loony, Bob (Giovanni Lombardo Radice; CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE - 1980; who frequently uses the name ""John Morghen""), entering a seemingly empty house, looking for a place to sleep. He finds a female blow-up doll (he fondles it like it was a real woman!) and then discovers a rotting corpse covered in worms (it doesn't scare him away, since he needs a place to sleep!). We are then taken to Junie's Lounge, a bar in Dunwich. The customers are talking about Father Thomas and how the town hasn't been the same since his suicide. The bar owner, Junie, tells them that it is all in their minds since all the descendants of the town's original founders were Salem witch burners, but even he has no explanation of why the mirror behind the bar shatters by itself and one of the bar's concrete walls cracks in half. This will not be the last time we are in Junie's lounge.
  Nosy newspaper reporter Peter Bell (the late Christopher George; GRIZZLY - 1976; PIECES - 1982) is looking for a story, so he decides to make Mary's death his next one. He attends her burial (which no one but himself attends!) and watches as the grave diggers stop putting dirt over her coffin for a dinner break! In a series of coincidences which are too hard to overlook, Mary wakes up in her coffin and starts screaming (Didn't the funeral parlor ever hear of embalming?). Peter hears her and without any care for Mary's safety, begins chopping away at the casket with a pick-axe and frees Mary from her dirt prison. Back at Mary's house, Theresa tells Peter and Mary that when Father Thomas committed suicide on consecrated ground, he opened the Gates of Hell. The only way to close the Gates is to dig up Father Thomas' grave and take his body off of the consecrated grounds. She also tells them that they will have to do it before Monday, which is All Saints' Day. If they don't do it before then, the Gates will remain open and the unimaginable will happen to all people on Earth. Evil will reign and good will no longer exist.
  It is at this time a series of graphic deaths happen. A necking young couple in a car, Rosie (Daniela Doria) and Tommy (future director Michele Soavi; STAGEFRIGHT - 1987; THE CHURCH - 1989), see the reanimated corpse of Father Thomas. Rosie begins begins bleeding at her eyes and all her internal organs come pouring out of her mouth. Tommy has his brains removed when Father Thomas rips the back of his head open (the brains seeping through his fingers). It seems if anyone sees a reanimated corpse, they are doomed to die a gory death. Some of the townspeople blame Bob for the series of deaths, but deep-down inside, they know it has something to do with their ancestry. Little John-John Robbins (Luca Paisner) sees his dead sister Emily (Antonella Interlenghi; YETI: GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY - 1977; who died earlier in the film when she visited Bob and the corpse in the house tore out the back of her head) staring at him through his bedroom window and nearly scaring him to death. This is not the only dead body that has come to life, as painter Sandra (Janet Agren; EATEN ALIVE! - 1980) finds the dead body of an old woman in her kitchen, who was buried earlier in the day. She calls her psychiatrist, Gerry (Carlo De Mejo; CONTAMINATION - 1980), to come to her studio to prove she is not insane and when he gets there, the body has disappeared. Strange things happen in her studio, like a window shattering by itself, the shards of glass embedding themselves into a wall, which begins to bleed.
  Then things start to get really nasty. When Mr. Ross (Venantino Venantini; CANNIBAL FEROX - 1981) catches Bob with his daughter (Bob was only trying to find somewhere to sleep), he forces Bob to meet his death at the mercy of a spinning bit of a table drill (this is the scene that this film is best remembered for, as the drillbit enters Bob's head on the left side and exits out the right side). Peter and Mary meet Gerry and Sandra at Gerry's office, where they are attacked by millions of (real) maggots. Gerry then gets a phone call from John-John, who tells him that Emily has killed his parents. After picking up John-John, Gerry, Peter and Mary (Sandra is left to look after John-John at her studio) discover that all the bodies at the local funeral home are missing from their coffins. They must find Father Thomas' tomb and remove him from his casket before All Saints' Day, which is only a couple of hours away. Sandra has the back of her head torn off by the rotting corpse of Emily and John-John runs away to the cemetery that our trio is at. He is saved by Gerry, who can't believe his eyes when he sees Emily staring back at him. Our trio discover Father Thomas' family tomb, but are they too late? It is now All Saints' Day.
  The patrons of Junie's Lounge are attacked, killed and eaten by a decaying Bob and the living dead. Peter is killed by a decaying Sandra, who rips the back of his head off, his brains pouring out of the wound. Gerry and Mary are nearly killed by Father Thomas and the dead occupants of the family rise from their graves, when they surround the pair (Mary begins bleeding from her eyes). Gerry grabs a wooden crucifix from one of the graves and impales the corpse of Father Thomas through his stomach (it leaves a big hole), causing all of the other living dead to catch fire and die. In the film's most WTF moment, John-John (who is now in the custody of the police) spots the pair and goes running towards them. We hear Mary say, ""No! No!"" and then scream, while the camera freezes on John-John's face and an optical effect shows the film shattering into pieces. What!?! (The closest I could come up with an explanation is that whomever sees the walking dead are doomed to die, as all three, Gerry, Mary and John-John have seen at least one.).
  The extras on the Blu-Ray fail to address the ending, but they are informative nonetheless. We find out that Lucio Fulci was not fond of actors and was basically a dictator on set. It is rumored that he took great joy in seeing his actors suffer after being pelted with live maggots and Christopher George, who had many arguments with Fulci, filled up Fulci's tobacco pouch with maggots (Fulci always brought his tobacco pouch and pipe on set). He also made Daniela Doria put freshly-slaughtered sheep guts in her mouth (!) for the film's internal organ puking scene. No one interviewed had good memories about Fulci, but there is no doubt in anyone's mind that he was able to turn out good, if not excellent, scenes of gore (even though the actors really suffered for their craft and it shows on-screen). Another extra on the disc is Italian special makeup expert Gino De Rossi (BURIAL GROUND - 1980) explaining how he achieved all the practical effects, including showing us actual props from the film. Besides denigrating all American productions, De Rossi is as eerie as most of his creations, as his left eye seems to be permanently crossed and looking at his nose. The camera films him on his right side, but when he turns his head, you get a creepy feeling. The screenplay, by Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti (CUT AND RUN - 1985), tries to explain what is going on, but the fact is that there are too many holes in the plot to make it realistic (The biggest being: Why wasn't Mary embalmed? Also, the timeline is seriously screwed-up.).
  This film, released theatrically in the U.S. in 1983 by Motion Picture Marketing (MPM) in an  Unrated cut under the title THE GATES OF HELL, was originally released on VHS (under that title) by Paragon Video with an overly dark widescreen VHS release by Creature Features Entertainment in 1996 (I question its legality). Anchor Bay Entertainment issued a widescreen DVD of the uncut version (under the review title) early in the New Millennium, but the Blu-Ray, from Blue Underground, is the only way to watch this film. The print is immaculate and you will learn more than you hoped to know about this film in the disc's plentiful extras. While not my favorite Fulci film (That would be A CAT IN THE BRAIN - 1990, where Fulci plays a bastardized version of himself. After hearing people talk about him, it may not be bastardized at all!), it is still an enjoyable way to view a film made during a time when anything goes. Also starring Robert Sampson (RE-ANIMATOR - 1985), with a cameo by Fulci as the doctor who examines Emily's body. Not Rated. Useless Trivia Dept: For years I used the name ""Charles Hamm"" as my handle on the many forums I subscribed to. The name was taken off a graveyard marker in the advertising material for this film.",1521936000,2,10450,4.575628006413683
