8497891,5,B006GVNHRK,Then this is where to get tips on how to be on the edge!  Very accurate in how it really was then.  Definitely voyeristic nostalgic and insightful of a time and characters that ruled and riled.,1405209600,,193,4.333333333333333
8497892,5,B006GVNHRK,"To be honest not one of the films excerpted or discussed on this DVD seems all that compelling and very few of the individual artists discussed seem all that compeling either. What is compelling though is not necessarily the art (on any given night you might see a new band and a new film) but the primitive conditions in which these artists lived and created their own version of life/art in the late 20th Century. The artists' street ethos/aesthetic was forged in the cauldron of a bankrupt and depraved mid to late 70's NYC and their collective story of survival is more interesting than any of their individual art works/visions. Ultimately what they collectively created was an attitude that still survives in the work of many New York bands, artists and filmmakers.

The most articulate spokespeople of the No Wave ethos/aesthetic are John Lurie (the quintessential late 20th Cent denizen of all marginal arts), Jim Jarmusch (by far the most intelligent and articulate No Wave/DIY spokesman),  Lydia Lunch (by far the No Wave's most charismatic/theatrical performer), and Thurston Moore who offers his take on what the scene looked and felt like and meant to a 15 year old experiencing this legendary urban milieu (Max's Kansas City, CBGB, MUDD Club) not as an insider creator but as an outsider observer.",1388534400,7,1311,4.981735159817352
8497893,5,B006GVNHRK,"This is a very interesting documentation of  contemporary avant-garde film-making. A well-made film, great information, reliable sources, besides which being full of off-beat characters and films. Just great.",1372636800,,208,6.428571428571429
8497894,5,B006GVNHRK,"Wow! This was like watching a documentary on my misspent youth. I knew the bands. I saw the movies. My room mate was MAKING the same kind of movies. I was lurking around the neighborhood. My boyfriend (later husband) played at CBGB's.
Blank City gives a vivid picture of the creative chaos fermenting in the aftermath of the Disco era. It was messy, dangerous and absolutely exhilarating. The documentary doesn't shy away from the darker side of the era - drugs, AIDS, crime, selling out - but also examines the wild combinations of art, music and film produced during the time. And of course it was great fun pointing and shrieking ""Oh my God, remember that place?"" ""That band?"" ""That gallery?"" ""My hair used to be that color, too!""",1362355200,,733,4.689922480620155
8497895,5,B006GVNHRK,"What really made this documentary interesting for me was the insight into a time period and culture that very few people got to experience. A time of unbridled, chaotic, rebellious, unorthodox creativity in lower Manhattan during the 70's/80's. The whole idea of this culture seems to be, cast away everything you know about ""art, film and music"" and be original. The less you knew about the art form you were a part of the better. The palpability of what was actually produced by these artists appears to be secondary to this idea of complete rebellion, down with society, down with your beliefs, we gonna do what we wanna do and create our own beliefs and art, on meth.

Walking down the streets of lower east side Manhattan today with the 1k+ monthly rents, hipsters, bodegas, corporate stores, dive bars, cabs, families etc, its almost hard to believe that nyc really was once really a place with the burning trash cans, abandoned buildings and scum bags. These artists actually flourished and found passion in this almost post-apocalyptic version of new york city.

But like anything that is ""cool and real"" suddenly the celebrities want to hang out with the artists, a few artists break out and make some cash, and the whole scene crumbles in response as the core beliefs of the culture are actually being undermined by the very artists who were central to the cultures rise in the first place. A very interesting cycle to consider, with many parallels in today's cultural context of ""real artists"", ""selling out"", and the effect it has on their respective culture/art. But hey, IFC sure is hell is not complaining, and neither am I. A great movie (am I supposed to say film?), watch it.",1355788800,5,1693,4.794520547945205
8497896,3,B006GVNHRK,"Interesting look at the New York film/art scene of the late 70s and early 80s. Though not compelling enough to seek it out unless you already have an interest.

And man, NYC was a mess - at least the parts these folks lived in.",1326240000,6,227,4.159090909090909
