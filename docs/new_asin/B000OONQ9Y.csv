2798080,5,B000OONQ9Y,"Beauty & The Beast's second season had a rough start, owing to the writer's guild strike in the fall of 1988.  But out of adversity often come great things, and greatness is in abundance during this beloved series' sophomore year.

I don't want to give away too many plot points, for those who haven't seen (or maybe have forgotten) the events of the series.  But to be fair to those who'd rather be surprised....MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.  It's safe to say that the love between Catherine and Vincent grows stronger, even as they brave seemingly insurmountable obstacles to their relationship.  Returning guest stars from season one include Linda Hamilton's then-husband Bruce Abbott as Devin; Edward Albert as the ambitious yet tragic Elliot Burch; Terrylene as the deaf-mute Laura; and the wonderful Tony Jay as Vincent's chief nemesis, Paracelsus.  And the many returning Tunnel characters get a chance to shine in the impressive ""Dead of Winter,"" and in ""Labyrinths,"" in which we learn the reasons many of them now reside beneath the streets of New York City.

I will begrudgingly acknowledge there were a couple of sub-standard episodes.  These include the somewhat Vincent-less ""Trial,"" in which Catherine prosecutes a man accused of killing his son; and the excessively violent ""The Hollow Men.""  But these are but two blemishes in an otherwise excellent season of television.

On the plus side, the aforementioned ""Dead of Winter"" is only one of three episodes that with a Christmas theme.  ""Remember Love"" is the B & B version of ""It's a Wonderful Life""; ""God Bless the Child"" offers a message of hope, even as an unforeseen obstacle threatens Vincent & Catherine's relastionship.  And t.v. just doesn't get any better than the season closing trilogy, which elevate this gentle romantic fantasy to near-operatic proportions.  And in the best tradition of cliffhanging season-enders, leave you dying to know what comes next.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Beauty & The Beast.  I hope everyone who has enjoyed this unique show will continue to support its release on DVD.  We still have one more season--albeit a shortened and somewhat controvesial one--to go!",1175126400,81,2173,5.113314447592068
2798081,5,B000OONQ9Y,"The second season is less violent than the first and deals much more with personal issues. One the best is ""God Bless the child"" and ""A Fair and Perfect Night"".  Well worth buying. Keep the Dream Alive.

edited 7/23/07:

What can be added to what has already been said? Season 2 looks great on DVD.
I am going through them one by one. One of my favorites is still ""God Bless the Child"". I love how Lana accepts Vincent and never flinches away. Very, very beautiful. The woman who plays Lana I thought was a very gifted actress too.

If you are a fan, you must purchase Season 2. The ending of episode, ""Sticks and Stones"" of Catherine and Vincent talking is one of the very best moments of their love.

I look forward to seeing Ron Pearlman and Linda Hamilton's interviews in the last couple of episodes.",1175126400,18,804,4.405405405405405
2798082,5,B000OONQ9Y,I love this series so much and I love how they released the first season this year and the second season is not far behind. The love between Catherine and Vincent is really beautiful and really touches me and I know a lot of fans agree.,1175040000,11,236,4.1521739130434785
2798083,5,B000OONQ9Y,"Being a big B&B fan, I can find no wrong with this Season 2.  Loved every episode.  This entire series has so much soul, that you will dwell on each episode long after they are over.  Can't go wrong with this one.",1481328000,,213,4.023809523809524
2798084,5,B000OONQ9Y,In 1987 Vincent was probably one of the best make-up jobs in television. Ron Pearlman (Hellboy) brought the character to life. Beauty and the Beast was an incredible show for about 1.5 seasons before they started with all the crazy Vincent stories and Linda Hamilton wanting to get out of the series at the end of the second season. The short-lived final season was able to keep it's audience or find a new one with killing off Catherine and attaching Vincent's attachment to the baby.  I have the three seasons. The quality is good as is the sound. it's a great collection item that offers hours and hours of entertainment.,1473984000,2,624,4.672727272727273

I have to say I did cheat a little and went ahead to view the first two episodes and the last episode of season 3.  After going through half of season 2 I realized why I stopped watching.  As  much as I loved Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman I think I had had just about enough and it just kind of got the ""same ole same ole"" feeling with the episodes.  I'm glad I had the chance to watch it again and I enjoyed it but again I don't have the interest to finish season 3.  Something is just missing. The fire and love between the two of them was what drew me to it but it did get boring.",1441065600,,745,3.8300653594771243

You will be mesmerized by this Vincent he portrays masterfully through beautiful makeup by Oscar winner Rick Baker. The series topics are relevant even today, 27 years later.

2798142,5,B000OONQ9Y,"I loved this series on television. I watched it every night with my wife. I get emotional even thinking about it. Back then she and I was very much in love. This series captured the essence of what true love really meant. We believed in our love the same way and communicated through our third eye much like Vincent & Catherine. The episode about Lover lost impacted us and I never will forget that episode. We were shocked and stunned. But the message of death having no dominion was clear a powerful. Unfortunately a few years later, I was placed in a position where I truly understood what it meant. My wife Shelia G. Wheeler went to glory and the words of this show never left me. The magic and spirituality of it all kept me strong. That was 1991. I was 32 at the time. At 57 I can honestly say though lovers be lost, love never is. I have to stop writing because i am about to cry. But get this series and you will understand what true love really is.",1396396800,,957,4.2349726775956285
2798143,5,B000OONQ9Y,To me this was the most deep and moving and untouchable love that any writer could ever come up with. To many narrow-minded people saw something bad in this TV program that wasn't there. All love should be that strong and real and intense.,1392422400,,239,4.454545454545454

Seems the end of Season One, the scripts began to improve tremendously. Season Two continues and improved, until the last trilogy, which I personally did not prefer because of the direction the show ended up going. The stories were good, just seemed like the beginning of the demise of the show. They improved on Season One by adding the leading cast dialogue about the show, but were only snippets.

2798167,4,B000OONQ9Y,Again a very short TV series about teaching people to recognize their potential. It was also a love story about two different people. A longer version of the classic only the beast was not enchanted. Good,1303776000,3,204,4.694444444444445
2798168,5,B000OONQ9Y,"When you've come up with such an amazing first season of a tv show as the producers of Beauty and the Beast did, it's difficult to come up with something as good as that. Especially when network executives get in the way of most storylines and creativity.
The producers wanted to let Vincent and Catherine get more intimate. The network said 'no, not even a kiss on the mouth'.
So where to go after the ending of A Happy Life (the first seasons finale)? And that's how most episodes felt like Season 1 setbacks. After the emotional/intimate ending of the first season here are Vincent and Catherine acting somehow uncomfortable whenever 'intimate' with each other.
Still, it's another great season with lots of beautiful moments. And the longer her hair growed the more beautiful Linda Hamilton became.
The best episodes are Orphans (GREAT outstanding performance by Linda Hamilton), A Kingdom by the Sea (another great performance by the beautiful miss Hamilton and also by Edward Albert as Elliott Burch) and the trilogy that ended the 2nd season (with AMAZING performances by Ron perlman).
A really nice addition to this second season set are the short intro interviews with Ron and Linda to some of the episodes.
I hate to admit it, but I agree with some of BatB's producers' comments about the 2nd season episodes; 'many of them were very weak and could have been so much better'. That's also how Linda Hamilton felt and what ultimately changed the course of this show.
For all the fans who are curious about some of the storylines the producers had planned for the 2nd season, find yourself a copy of the book 'The Unseen Beauty and the Beast' by Edward Gross.",1292544000,3,1666,4.768166089965398

2798170,4,B000OONQ9Y,"I always love this series, am a fan of the first hour.
But those interviews do really disturb me. Ron is so sweet and taking it serious and trying to give us some information, but Linda Hamilton... what a mess!
Especially on ""The Rest is Silence""-Comment you can really see in her face at some points, that she's really bored and has no interest at all in all this. I'm sorry, if this too offensive, but to me, she seems, like she's on alcohol or on other kind of drugs while doing the interview. She really has nothing to say and what she says, even makes lovely Mr. Perlman sometimes looking weird, he's trying not to show it, but i noticed.
Of course, they both got paid for this gathering, but in Linda Hamiltons face i can clearly see, that she only did it for the money. Can't enjoy the series anymore, because it seems to me, that it was just ""a job"" for her, nothing else at all. Just money. Knew it before, because she left the show to be able to do ""Terminator 2"", which meant more money... but that behaviour of her's really underlines it more and more. That commentary on the S2 DVD really made me DISLIKE her. That destroyed sooo much..  all the magic gone. But she doesn't seem to care.
Yeah well... she's old now. And she looks old, not much ""Beauty"" left.
It's a great show, she could have really gotten in this state of ""cult"", like Star Trek..  she messed it up. And though she doesn't deserve it, she wasted that chance. But she did ""Terminator 2""...  yeah well..  *rolleyes*
Wrong path... wrong attitude, Ms. Hamilton! I just pity her...  she doesn't seem too happy with herself too..  but i can't feel sorry. It's her own fault.",1264032000,2,1649,4.390163934426229

2798184,4,B000OONQ9Y,"Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman return in the second season of the fantasy series Beauty and the Beast. Season Two features grittier storylines that probe the worst that humanity has to offer, including street gangs, drug addicts, gruesome murders, and the sick revenge of a twisted mind that threatens to shatter Vincent's sanity. There were several episodes that I really enjoyed, such as ""God Bless the Child,"" where a frightened teenage prostitute seeks sanctuary for her unborn child and falls in love with Vincent, ""A Fair and Perfect Knight,"" where Michael, a very bright young tunnel dweller, falls in love with Catherine before starting college Above, ""Brothers,"" featuring the return of Vincent's brother Devin, a master at reinventing himself, and ""Remember Love,"" a Capra-esque look at what life would have been like if Vincent hadn't met Catherine. Several characters from the first season return, including Mouse, Laura, Elliott Burch, and Paracelsus.

The main story arc of season two revolves around outcast mad genius John Pater, aka Paracelsus (Tony Jay). After being expelled from the tunnels and nearly killed in a fire in the last season, Paracelsus plots his ghastly revenge against Father and Vincent, first in the episode ""Dead of Winter"" and in the final season-end trilogy ""What Rough Beast,"" ""Ceremony of Innocense,"" and ""The Rest is Silence."" The dark, gory storyline in the final three episodes sets up a cliffhanger for the final season, which in turn was even darker and more violent than the second. I really disliked the direction that the show was taking at the end of season two; this subject had already been covered in season one's ""The Alchemist"" and I would have preferred to see a stronger focus on Catherine and Vincent's relationship. The writers essentially ruined their special relationship by placing Vincent in increasingly more violent situations that shred the delicate balance between man and beast.

But there are several bright spots: the writing feels more consistent, there is more physical contact and less awkwardness between Catherine and Vincent, and there are several good episodes here, such as ""When the Bluebird Sings,"" which stars the (possible) ghost of a playful painter, and ""A Distant Shore,"" in which Vincent is largely absent, but there is some gorgeous dream scenery of Catherine and Vincent walking together in the rolling surf. Ron Perlman emotes extraordinarily well even under Rick Baker's superb makeup and bulky clothes; in the later episodes, his eyes capture the madness and torture inside of Vincent. Set design is gorgeous as usual, calling to mind Brian Froud's work on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Crystal-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000R8YC1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Crystal (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>. Extras are scarce, but there are several new introductions by Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman on select episodes. The packaging is great: it's easy to access each DVD, and they're separated so they don't get scratched.

2798199,5,B000OONQ9Y,"The 1980s television series ""Beauty and the Beast"" is my favorite subject for discussion.  The Second Season DVDs are just as beautifully digitally remastered as the first season was and have the addition of wonderful commentaries by the two main stars of the series, Ron Perlman, who plays Vincent (The Beast), and Linda Hamilton, who plays Catherine Chandler (Beauty).  This season of the series chronicles the ever continuing love story developing between Vincent, the Beast who lives in caves and tunnels under the streets of New York City, and Catherine Chandler, an investigative lawyer working in the District Attorney's office.  It masterfully portrays how they battle evil together, as well as the differences between their 2 worlds, in a continuing effort to stay in love through all adversities.

Because of my love of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I began writing a novel which is a sequel to this series in early July of 2007.  I completed and published it in May of 2008.  The title of my book is ""Love's Journey to Awakening--Beauty and the Beast--Happily Ever After.""  I wrote it under my pen name, Laurel Cain Haws, and my editor is Dr. Thayle K. Anderson, an English professor emeritus from Murray State University.  He is a trusted friend, and a colleague of my beloved late husband, Dr. Gary L. Haws, who was my ""Vincent.""

My book has a very specific target audience, those who loved this series starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, and hated its premature demise with its tragic ending.  My book fixes that.  It doesn't change the ending.  It begins where the series ends and changes the outcome, so it has an happy ending and perhaps a new beginning for more stories about these beloved characters.

If that idea appeals to you, it is essential that you watch all 3 seasons before reading my book.  Even if you saw them when they first aired almost 20 years ago, you really need to review and watch them again in order to fully understand and appreciate my book.  I never get tired of watching them, and I hope that you will enjoy seeing these characters come back to life with a new story line.

The questions from the series that my novel answers are:
1. Is Catherine Chandler (Beauty) really dead?
2. Where did Vincent (the Beast) really come from?
3. Can there be an happy ending to a modern day fairy tale that starts out, ""Once Upon a Time in the City of New York?""

Buy all three seasons of the series that are now available.  Then visit my website, where you can download a free copy of my entire novel.  My website link can be accessed at kandycain1587 ""My World"" on eBay or on my profile page on Amazon.  The timeline and characters are very precious to me, and I was very careful with them.  I hope that you will enjoy reading my book as much as I enjoyed writing it.  Karen L. Haws",1199491200,3,2814,4.608433734939759

2798207,5,B000OONQ9Y,"So far I have only seen two episodes of the second season and I am so impressed with the exploration into the darker side of the world around lovers Catherine Chandler, the tough assistant DA of New York, and the gentle yet protective Vincent.

Raw emotion is presented as Catherine and Vincent ""begin"" their official relationship-- going to concerts by hiding near drainage pipes, planning vacations to isolated spots, dreaming of things that seem possible but just aren't. Meanwhile, they're still trying to save the people around them from immpossible situations while being there for each other.

I like that the fact that in this season (so far) there are no neat and tidy endings and sometimes love cannot truly conquer all (example being the first episode, ""Chamber Music."") In all aspects of this, Catherine and Vincent's strong love for each other still shines and actually makes them stronger as a couple. They come to realize that sometimes you can't really help someone, but you can let them know you're there. That, in itself, is more than needed.

The cinematography is terrific and the dialogue, while poetic and lyrical, fills the story with flavor and provides art through the tough stories. I still love Catherine; I'm still in love with Vincent. My only complaint is that this series didn't last any longer than three. But, it's a beautiful journey all in all, and I hope you dare to take it.",1189555200,,1411,4.870833333333334

It amazes me that with the type of junk that is on TV today, something like this was ever made. (I cannot tell you how many times I have re-read Shakespeare's Sonnets since this series was on...Shakespeare did indeed ""know everything."") Not only is the romance between the two leading characters incredibly moving and uplifting, all of the characters are of amazing interest, original and compelling.  Of course the ""underground"" community is the most interesting, but with Katherine as the conduit between the two worlds, it causes one to hold one's breath throughout each episode, regardless of where the action is taking place.  The setting of the underground world is beyond belief --- beautiful and frightening and literally fantastic.  The love between Father and Vincent is so amazingly touching.  I would love it if one special TV movie with the full cast could be made --- not that anything could add to the story, but perhaps one special incredibly intelligent writer could come up with something so that once again we could see Vincent, Katherine, Father, and everyone.  I know it's not possible; wouldn't make any sense given the way it played out, but still...  But I am so happy that these DVD's are finally available.  I've been aching for them.  Thank you, whoever made this decision, for making it available once again to the world.  Maybe, in addition to we fans who loved it so the first time around, it will also find a new audience who loves it as much as we do.  That will be a real gift.  I just hope the word gets out about these DVD's so that people know they can now buy them and watch them once again.  Thank you so much!",1184112000,8,1815,4.705696202531645
2798233,5,B000OONQ9Y,"Many fans wrote reviews for season one, stating their thanks but complaining that there were no extra features on the release. Well, the studio listened to the fans. This release has recently taped special introductions to certain episodes by both Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton. It is neat seeing them together again, some 17 years after the series ended. The first introduction begins at the front before season two begins with ""Chamber Music."" As to the video quality on this DVD set, I looked at two episodes last night, ""Dead of Winter"" and ""God Bless the Child,"" and they were, in my opinion, both of higher quality than the episodes in the season one set. I viewed ""The Watcher"" tonight and it looked fantastic. They cleaned up season two better than season one. I should note that there is also a video introduction by Perlman and Hamilton before the last season two episode, ""The Rest is Silence."" I am so grateful they were asked and willing to take part in this season two DVD release. If you haven't bought it yet, you need to!",1184112000,8,1039,4.6521739130434785

2798235,5,B000OONQ9Y,"Starring Jon Bon Jovi and Sarah Connor as the crimefighting brother and sister with identical facial features and wildly differing blonde manes, this tender re-enactment of Cocteau's seminal black and white gothic masterpiece of 14th century cinema still possesses the power to heal little blind orphans, nearly two decades after its original regurgitation.

Season 2 continues where Season 1 left off, and continues the story until the Season Finale, where it ends.  Until Season 3.

One thing i still don't understand.  If Bon Jovi lives in a sewer, and Sarah Connor is a lawyer, at what point in human history do the Machines twig that the conception of John Connor could have been easily prevented by the wanton destruction of every copy of the OST to ""Young Guns II - Blaze of Glory""?

All will be revealed in the Season 3 Finale.  I hope.",1183248000,2,844,4.826388888888889
2798236,5,B000OONQ9Y,"This is one of the best TV series ever! It has all the ingredients that make a classic - well-plotted storylines, a cast of interesting characters, and above all, an otherworldly romance between the gentle, noble Vincent, and the luminously beautiful Catherine. In each scene where they come together, you cannot help but be mesmerised by the tremendous depth of emotion and feeling that is seen on their faces, their body language, and their dialogue. These two share an on-screen chemistry that is quite rare even till today. Linda Hamilton plays her role with a measure of beauty, courage and conviction that is utterly convincing. Ron Perlman's Vincent is the gentle beast, who is kind and loving to his friends and the needy and brutally vicious to the scum of society. His love for Catherine is so poetic, yet even when these two yearning souls are exchanging romantic dialogue or reading from books under the moonlight, they appear convincing and their love for each other rings true. I know I'm gushing here but it is this compelling love story that makes the show what it is, and although each episode has its share of thrills, it is Vincent's & Catherine's unerring love for each other that compels us to view the show. I can't wait for the DVD release.",1179446400,30,1263,4.771689497716895
2798237,5,B000OONQ9Y,I love beauty and the beast. Hopefully the second season will include at least some special features.  I'm sure any fan would faint if there were any episode commentaries from Linda Hamilton and Ron Pearlman. I know I probably would. Also what happened to the lost love letters that were included on the VHS versions. Hopefully we'll be able to see them on a future release.,1178236800,6,374,4.666666666666667
2798238,5,B000OONQ9Y,"It stands to reason that, since you are reading this in the Season Two section, you are already well aware of the epic majesty and absolute Love that are Vincent and Catherine. Words are beyond insufficient in describing this series for those who remain mournfully ignorant, but if it will intrigue new viewers, it is definitely worth the effort.

In short, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is Poetry in sight, sound and emotion. This is the one series that will forever be known as the impossibly beautiful, heart-wrenching, and all-consuming dream that changed everyone who understood its message. I truly pity those who refused to do so, even if it was in part due to them that such a brilliant masterpiece was cancelled so quickly.

Now to the topic at hand: Season Two, the most beloved of many a fan. Personally, I disagree. Every single episode captured my imagination and left me aching for more, even in the most violent and tragic moments. I simply love them all, so much so that I own a boot-leg ""all season"" set (rest assured that I have bought the official versions and will continue to do so). However, I will admit to having something very close to a ""favorite,"" and it happens to reside in this season, so... take from that what you will.

""Brothers,"" in my opinion, encapsulates the very spirit of a very difficult to define series, and it has dear Charles. When he and Vincent talk about the misleading effects of appearances, giving Charles the courage to remove his bag-like mask... I literally wept from sheer joy. While it is true that the man will never be an Adonis by ""normal"" standards because of the disfigurement from his disease, he could power an entire hemisphere indefinitely with that smile. Seeing him come to terms with his differences, with the support of his newfound friends, and gain the courage to face the World Above for the sake of his eternally restless ""brother"" Devon left me deeply moved. Such is the incandescence of all Vincent, Catherine, and their world have been trying to share with us for the last two decades. I can only pray that more will listen in time.

Like the rest of the hopelessly addicted followers, I eagerly await this release, when I might add the in-store version to my Amazon pre-order as I have with Season One. Will the extremely controversial Season Three have the same luck? I sincerely hope so.",1175731200,31,2359,4.718446601941747
2798239,5,B000OONQ9Y,"Although long rumoured to have had only women devotees, in fact BEAUTY AND THE BEAST remains to this day my own favourite American television serial as well.  It debuted in 1987, during perhaps the most EXTERNALLY oppressive period in my wife's and my entire marriage.  Feeling alienated from so much around us, we drew deeper into our already close relationship and spent countless hours together reading aloud, listening to good music, and drinking MANY pots of tea.  So this programme about a couple estranged from the 'normal' world -- whose love, nigh-mystical understanding of one another, and taste for simple joys were so like our own -- was deeply encouraging.  Then too, its many literary allusions actually advanced our own interest in classic literature.  I credit the scripts with our appreciation of everything from Shakespeare's 29th sonnet to Rilke's LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET to THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.

Of course, the show was not flawless.  Its earliest episodes suffered from excessive Beast-to-the-rescue plotlines; and after Linda Hamilton's departure, the truncated third and final season was seriously marred by a misguided decision to escalate action and violence, presumably in hope of better ratings.  The serial's middle run was by far its best, focusing on Vincent and Catherine's deeply-romantic yet functionally-platonic relationship, the intriguing history of the tunnel community, and the mysterious wonders and perils of the vast realms even further Below.  Yet, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, that the programme came to be at all was a blessing beyond hope in a medium so often glutted with mere ugliness and inanity.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was that rarest of television phenomena:  A true work of art.",1175558400,66,1740,5.290909090909091
8185883,3,B000OONQ9Y,One of my favorite shows. I do hate the fact that it appears as though the episodes were not digitally remastered or digitized as the underground scenes & nighttime scenes are so pixilated that it really ruins the moment as you cannot tell what its supposed to look like. I had almost all the episodes on VHS but they got ruined so I was happy to find them on DVD but its incredibly disappointing to see overly pixilated scenes to where its just unbearable to watch.,1525910400,,466,4.430232558139535

It only lasted 3 seasons and had it not been for the way the producers screwed up the direction of the show with that awful third season it could have gone on for several more.

8185891,5,B000OONQ9Y,"""The Beauty and the Beast"" television series starring Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman is my all time favorite!  My favorite episodes are ""A Happy Life"" (reportedly Ron Perlman's favorite episode) and ""Orphans.""  Vincent and Catherine were the most unselfish of lovers.  Each was always willing to sacrifice their all for the other which is what true love is all about!  You really forget that Vincent is a ""beast"" because he possesses so much ""inner beauty"" and wisdom.  Vincent had a tremendous impact on Catherine who as a young privileged woman was primarily self-absorbed (i.e. reporting to work at any time of the day, dating corporate types, spending her time shopping, etc.) until her ""accident"" and Vincent took her ""below.""  After that, as an attorney, Catherine was always willing to help anyone less fortunate as well as the people in Vincent's community.  Catherine had a tremendous impact on Vincent because she loved him and accepted him for who he was - a ""beast"" but a gentleman who deeply loved and admired her.  He felt everything that Catherine felt- it was so amazing to watch!

I will never forget the letter he wrote Catherine in Season 3. I don't want to be a spoiler to first-time viewers! I hope you enjoy this classic favorite as much as I have!

Thank you, Amazon Prime staff, for including in your television line-up!",1490745600,,1344,4.855263157894737
