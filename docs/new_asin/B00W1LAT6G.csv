7114417,5,B00W1LAT6G,"The third installment of the Dollanganger family series is, in many respects, the darkest of the first three. Here, the past catches up with the present resulting in an outpouring of bottled up secrets that threaten to tear this family apart once and for all.  Yet, a renewed strength and determination comes forward that - for the time being as the curtain descends - halts the negative forces that this family must endure. Unfortunately, there is a not so subtle hint of what is to come at the very end of IF THERE BE THORNS which will undoubtedly fully emerge in its sequel, SEEDS OF YESTERDAY.  Forbidden love in the form of father-daughter and, later, sibling incest has been the primary underlying subject of this series.  But there is also betrayal, abusiveness, selfishness, jealousy, murder, deceit, adultery, class snobishness, and Biblical fundamentalism to contend with. Through it all, the various actors have held their respective own while dealing with this devil's brew that they have been given.  In IF THERE BE THORNS, the character of Bart (Mason Cook) and that of Jordan (Jedidiah Goodacre) - the two brothers that comprise this next generation of Dollangangers - are both especially well portrayed and highly convincing.  The supporting cast also comports itself in a most credible way. When the DVD comes out in late June, I highly recommend it.  Lifetime's presentation was marred by a constant influx of commercials that intruded without warning into the story.  The DVD won't have that problem.  Purchasing this series from the beginning is strongly  recommended as well.",1432425600,13,1596,5.084291187739463
7114418,4,B00W1LAT6G,"I saw it on lifetime and I found the movie exciting , suspenseful and entertaining. The third movie based on v.c andrews dollagangers book series is  my honest opinion is better than petals on the winds ,because its darker and better paced. My only complaint is the casting of Christopher with Jason Lewis , he did not fit for the role,  but if enjoy the first two films , you would love this juicy and revealing flim. Flowers in attic was mother's betrayal  , petals on the wind is a daughter's revenge and if there be thorns is family's secret past.",1431475200,2,551,4.435643564356436

7114426,4,B00W1LAT6G,"If There Be Thorns is the third in a four movie series following the lives of the children from Flowers in the Attic.  It's also based on a book by V.C. Andrews.  I watched this one then watched the last one Seed of Yesterday straight after.  You don't need to have seen the Petals in the Wind or the first film I guess to really understand what's going on.  It's simply a film where imagine you're a kid that gets picked on in school, you've got no friends, you're parents won't tell you a thing about your grandparents and you don't really believe the story being told about your father.  A weird woman moves in next door who wants to give you presents and treats you the way you expect your parents should be doing. Her servant gives you a book written by someone they say is your grandfather.  He is so like you, his judgmental negative views on women seem to make some sense to what has ruined your life. When you find out the secret your parents have been hiding, well how did they expect you were going to behave.

I found for a TV movie the acting level was higher than the norm.  The kid who played Bart did a pretty good job.  Heather Graham they'd done a decent job making her look grandmother aged than the younger versions of her in the previous films, which you'd imagine were filmed around the same time.  The major downside, as someone who has never read the book or had any idea going in what was going to happen, was that I could predict what was going to happen.  As soon as I saw a dog or a pool come into frame, for example, I thought well the obvious thing to happen would be this, and that's exactly what did happened.

These aren't Academy Award nominee standard of quality films or anything, they do have some ridiculous aspects like anyone who has sex not only doesn't lock the door but they also don't even close it, but if you should be able to come across this for a pretty cheap price being it's a made for TV movie, you might even come across it on TV, if either happens for you, these movies are worth checking out.",1470614400,,2047,4.260981912144703

In the last three movies from this series the same cannot be said.  They are okay to watch but how the characters are portrayed strongly differs from the book.

7114438,4,B00W1LAT6G,"I am a huge fan of the Dollanganger storyline. The five book series written by the original VC Andrews. I was excited when I learned that lifetime movie network was going to be releasing film adaptions of the books. This movie is based on the third novel of this haunting, family ordeal of secrets and lies, and skeletons in the closet type scenarios. Heather Graham comes back to repraise her role of Corrine Foxworth. She has played this character in the first two films that Lifetime Network has created, Flowers in the Attic and Petals in the Wind.

This one takes place as the next chapter, right after the second film which was Petals in the Wind. This has Corrines children Christopher and Cathy, brother and sister. Both have escaped the Foxworth hall. They live together as man and wife in California. Cathy with her two kids, Jory and Bart. Soon they realize that their past is slowly lurking, creeping up behind them. A mysterious woman happens to move right next door. Cathy's son Bart is befriended by the strange woman and soon Bart changes. The mysterious woman introduces Bart to his evil great grandfathers diary. Bark changes, and all the secrets and lies come back to haunt, destroy and control. Like the books, the movies are very controversial with the aspects of incest and family violence.

Starring the wonderful Jason Lewis who many will probably know from Sex and the City fame. He takes on, and plays the role of Christopher Dollanganger. Lewis is a fabulous actor and always is one of those performers that never gets the stardom he deserves. Also taking over the role of Cathy is the beautiful Rachel Carpani. Also a memorable performance. I think the shining star of this film has to go to actor, Mason Cook. He plays the son Bart. He does a fabulous job. He makes you believe his plight, and sends you down a spiral of emotions, and actions that leave a lasting mark.

But as always, the one true owner of this series of films, has to go to Heather Graham. She is always a stunning performer. Her characterization of Corrine Foxworth does the book character Justice. The films are very strong in excellence for TV films, through her expertise in the art of acting.

The original collection of these five books of the Dollanganger series is to me a series of books that should be read, and experienced. Their deep, their dark, sadistic and they're very disturbing. I think Lifetime Network has done this series justice. The first two where great, and If There Be Thorns is also a great filmed adaption of the third book in the series. I highly recommend all of three of the series. Being that I am reviewing, If There be Thorns, I will say for fans of VC Andrews, and for fans of suspense, thick drama, darkened mystery, then this is a priceless watch.

7114439,2,B00W1LAT6G,"So convoluted with twists that it has no real story. Brother and sister locked in room for 3yrs as children and end up having children of their own and now living as husband and wife. Weak hints and sick people, end has no closure, last minute shows Bart going crazy again. Not worth renting let along making a purchase. YUCK!  The two crazy ""Grandmothers"" and also of no worth.

7114440,5,B00W1LAT6G,"Moving on from Flowers in the Attic and Petals on the Wind, the next chapter in the saga of the Dollenganger children is called If There Be Thorns. Cathy and Chris are living in California with their two children (actually fathered by two separate men including one as a result of a revenge affair with her mothers husband, Bart). The four are living under the guise of being a normal family unit (mom, dad, two kids). This could be the most disturbing film in the series and if I did my calculations correctly, they are in the 1980s at this point (I think the first book took place in the late 1950s/early 1960s).

Bart  the child  is the darkness in this film. Awkward, small, dark haired and out of sorts, he seems to sense his disconnect in the family. Of course he receives validation of his feeling after his evil grandmother Corrine (who still looks like shes 20) moves in next door, fresh out of the asylum. At first, Bart is reluctant to be around Corrine but that quickly changes and all hell breaks loose.

I have to complement this film on its success in achieving (out of the first three Lifetime adaptations) that dark, moody quality it should have. And I attribute that to one of my all-time favorite directors  Nancy Savoca. I love her work from as far back as True Love and Household Saints and Dogfight to her more recent films like Union Square.

In this film, the darkness emerging from poor little Bart is manifesting throughout the entire family, including and especially on a young girl the family intends to adopt. Its more than disturbing to see such a cruel and angry child like Bart but thats the way it is. He is a product of the most dysfunctional union possible.

In any case, this is an important set up film for the final film in the series  the best one thus far  but definitely leading to the big finale.

7114450,4,B00W1LAT6G,"So for the sake of redundancy, this Lifetime movie series decided to take every gal who ever went to junior high school in the 1970-80s and revisit the VC Andress books that were oh so scandalous.  Even though certain things about them are dated, the underline story is scandalous and so taboo today you don't want to know how and why this could have happened.  This is perhaps the darkest chapter of this family's story, and they are all so, so, so very guilty of so, so, so many things.  And it's all squeezed into one episode which is difficult to keep up with yet essential if you want to see the soap go on.

Cathy and Chris are living in California (now under the family name Dollanganger), it is now six years after the Petals events took place, with their sons Jory and Bart.  Chris is not the biological father of either son, Jory is the son that she had with the guy she went to New York with years ago who was killed in a car accident, and Bart is the result of an affair she had with her step father to lash out at her evil mother, Corrine, for keeping them locked in the attic for years when they were kids.  Bart feels awkward behind his parents and dashing older brother, he doesn't feel that things are right somehow.  One day a mysterious woman moves in next door, an older woman who says she has no family or friends save for her butler, John Amos, and asks that Bart and Jory come and see her more often.  Jory balks at the idea, but Bart is more prone to it, once the woman says she will give him things for it.  Then the woman reveals that she is not some random stranger, but she is Corrine, Bart and Jory's long lost grandmother who they had not seen or heard from since she was shipped off to a psychiatric hospital years ago.  Her butler then provides Bart with a journal left from his great grandfather Malcolm (hence Corrine's father), which gives his innermost thoughts and feelings of a fundamentalist puritan about the sins of women, lust and greed.  And soon ... John Amos reveals that the whole family is overflowing with sin and lust.  Corrine (Bart's grandmother) and her husband were half uncle and niece, and Cathy and Chris are brother and sister.

Oy ... You can't make this up.  No wonder Bart has seeds planted within him to rebel into the opposite direction.  Instead of embracing the love of his family he is going to become cold and cruel.  He's going to preach the gospel, smell that fire and brimstone, and make others feel horrible about living their fun filled, questionably immortal lives.  In some ways, you can't blame him.  He is the product of incest and is ashamed of it, it's not exactly his fault things happened like this but he'll feel guilty enough to lash out at others over it.  Jory has his situation with his girlfriend which is going to be continued to the next novel ( like you didn't know) and Chris and Cathy are in love still but unsure of what to do with their kids.  And they are going to adopt a sweet little girl named Cindy whose mother died of cancer, and Jory will love her and Bart will hate her, and another subplot.

This is on one hand deep, on another hand camp, and on another hand confusing.  What is the point?  The point is that life is complicated and we all have a lot of secrets we are keeping from one another for some reason.  How much do you really know about your friends and neighbors, even your own family?  It may not be this juicy, but you really don't know how/why things happen.  Always be ready for something to learn about someone else.  And how it will or will not affect you or someone you know.  And don't judge people either, you never know the whole story.",1442102400,4,3659,4.349042709867452

However, after watching all four, I believed  this one to be my least favorite. But, I still purchased the DVD to add to my collection. Upon watching it, I was pleasantly  surprised: there are scenes that made it onto the DVD version that weren't on the version that aired on Lifetime---I'm assuming because  of time. The scenes that were missing added continuity to the story and made it, in my opinion,  much better. I like this installment now more than I did when I first watched it.
