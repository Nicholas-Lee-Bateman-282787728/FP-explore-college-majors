6881703,5,B00QU7LQ78,Great film! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Love the podcast and all of the YouTube videos as well. Keep up the good work guys!!!,1420502400,,122,4.3478260869565215
6881704,5,B00QU7LQ78,"Great video!  This and ""50 Years of the 911"" are top-notch productions.  Since the late 60s, some of the best driver-oriented sports cars have been mid-engined.  Here is a comparison of 3 almost-affordable middies on some of the most beautiful roads in the USA.  Highly recommended!",1419465600,,282,5.065217391304348
6881705,5,B00QU7LQ78,"Fantastic! If you are any sort of car enthusiast, you owe it to yourself to watch this! Todd, Paul and their crew did a fantastic job putting you in the driver seat of 3 amazing machines! The cars are gorgeous, the banter is witty, and the scenery is jaw dropping!  Do yourself a favor: Find a quiet block of time, grab your favorite beverage, sit in your favorite seat, and take in this awesome video. Me on the other hand, I'm going to go cash in my 401K so I can buy an Alfa 4C!",1418947200,,481,4.063157894736842
6881706,5,B00QU7LQ78,"Am a regular view of EveryDriver's YouTube channel, and am happy to support their work. Excellent production quality and a fun movie to watch. Also have their Porsche movie and I recommend that one as well.",1431993600,,206,4.75
6881707,5,B00QU7LQ78,"It's Porsche, whats there not to love?",1429401600,,38,4.571428571428571
6881708,4,B00QU7LQ78,"Paul and Todd do a great job describing every sensation while driving each of these cars.  This format is similar to how they review cars for their Youtube channel.  If you like their Youtube reviews, you will like this video.  The video is well produced and the audio was good.  I couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful cars.  There is some great scenery too.  Definitely check this out if you are shopping for any of the cars in the vid.  I was somewhat surprised at some of their conclusions.  Not as informative as their 911 vid, but very good none the less.",1426118400,,563,4.398058252427185
6881709,5,B00QU7LQ78,"I had originally bought this video via Vimeo. After having watched that a half dozen times and hearing from the Everyday Driver podcast that the BluRay had upgraded sound quality I figured it was time to buy the BluRay too. And based on my experience with this video I bought the 50 years of 911 video while I was it. As a bit of warning though. If you have been lusting over either the Cayman, 4c or Elise. Watching this video will only feed those desires.",1424476800,,457,4.325581395348837
6881710,5,B00QU7LQ78,"This is a great video for anyone who is interested in cars that handle well in the twisties. What is cool about this video is that Paul and Todd talk about the cars habits on the highways as well as in the twisties (their natural habitat). This is great because you have to drive between the canyons , mountain roads etc., often on long boring highway trips, so knowing how these cars perform on these is useful. The review format of Paul and Todd commenting on the same cars is great, sometime they agree, sometimes they don't, but it is always informative and entertaining. The video camera work is excellent and they choose some great driving roads to show off the cars. Highly recommend this video and also recommend that folks check out the Everyday Driver You Tube channel and podcasts, these guys are excellent reviewers of affordable fun new and used cars.",1424217600,,864,4.65359477124183
6881711,5,B00QU7LQ78,Really well done..  Makes me want to get an Elise even more:),1424044800,,61,4.083333333333333
6881712,5,B00QU7LQ78,"This is a beautiful film shot by people who really ""get"" what the driving experience is about. The cars are great and the reviews of the cars are as expected, but the scenery and how it is shot is simply amazing. My joy of driving not only comes from getting the most out of my car but exploring and discovering new landscapes as well. It's obvious that Paul and Todd must feel the same way. Mid Engines & Mountains is a perfect title for this film. The interaction of the cars and landscapes make this a must have for any car enthusiast that has searched for new and exciting places to drive.",1423008000,,593,4.303571428571429
6881713,5,B00QU7LQ78,I rented this video. It is worth the cost. Video is high quality and well done. Paul and Todd have become some of my favorite car reviewers. Check out everyday driver on youtube. Great stuff.,1420588800,,191,4.485714285714286
6881714,5,B00QU7LQ78,I really loved this film. Christmas day I watched it with the man who got me into cars (my father) and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll be getting him the 50 years of 911 film for fathers day soon enough as those are his fixation. I cannot recommend Everyday Driver's films and videos highly enough. Keep up the great work guys!,1420502400,,326,4.360655737704918
6881715,5,B00QU7LQ78,"If you follow them online then you'll know that hosts Paul and Todd have a delightful way of nitpicking apart every car they review. I particularly respect they fact that they can fill this hour long review all while avoiding the performance 'numbers' game. It may strike some as not being entirely 'in-depth' but it reminds of the kind of real car talks I've had in pubs and coffee houses after a day of car club cruzes, rallys, and track days. Not always purely unbiased, but never acrid, and always with respectful admiration  for the pleasures of motoring. One aspect I really enjoy about their 'comparison' videos is that I often find myself re-watching them over and over again and coming to different conclusions about which car I would prefer myself (see their Gt86 vs. Rx8 vs. s2000 segment). Bonus points for the ""map"" segment of this Bluray that highlights the actual roads this segment was shot on so that I might visit them myself... ever I find myself in California with time and rubber to burn.",1420502400,,1009,4.700564971751413
8692989,5,B00QU7LQ78,"These guys are the up and coming Top Gear, they take a limited budget and make it a work of art! And THE CARS!",1523318400,,110,3.625
8692990,5,B00QU7LQ78,"Two friends, 3 cool similarly priced cars with similar characteristics on amazing and normal roads. Paul and Todd are excellent reviewers, give great insight. Both have fun and informative personalities. However, this is not only a review film. It is informative but very entertaining and shot at the highest level with amazing sound and picture quality. Any driving enthusiast would love to watch this film. Heck, even my ""prefer to be chauffeured"" wife enjoyed it! Well worth the money spent, have watched it several times already. Check out their Everyday Driver podcast as well!",1508803200,,582,5.202127659574468
8692991,5,B00QU7LQ78,"I love supporting endeavors like this. The quality and content were excellent, and the video quality superb.

Please keep making content like this. It's incredibly refreshing.

I honestly don't even view the cars in this review as that desirable; my interest lies in Subarus and Corvettes, oddly enough. But for something like this to even exist is excellent. Please keep doing these.",1498953600,,384,5.17741935483871
8692992,5,B00QU7LQ78,"If you have even a passing interest in ""enthusiast"" cars, this film comparison of these sports cars is at once engaging and beautifully shot. Oh, the sound, especially the rumble of the engines whirring past, is none too shabby either. Enjoy!",1491436800,,242,4.926829268292683
8692993,5,B00QU7LQ78,Top notch quality as usual from you guys!!! Just ordered Pilgrimage!!,1451692800,,69,5.363636363636363
8692994,5,B00QU7LQ78,Another fantastic film from the guys at Everyday Driver. Loved it! The podcast where you guys talk behind the scenes really adds to the experience.,1446681600,,147,4.92

8692997,5,B00QU7LQ78,"Another Home Run by Todd and Paul.  There aren't that many mid-engine cars out there - yet Todd and Paul managed to come up with 3 that are very different in almost every way!!  I really enjoyed the way they exploited the strengths and weaknesses of each car in their commentaries.  Like ""50 Years of the 911"", the narratives are witty and insightful.  Even if you are firmly wedded to air conditioning and a quiet cabin with a quality sound system - you find yourself lusting over the Lotus and wishing you were pounding the pavement on the Pacific coast trying ever-harder to drown out the abundant tire noise with gear whine.  But as your affection for each car grows and your appreciation of the clever driver reviews builds, it's all overshadowed by the beauty of the road and the scenery and a real yearning to just be there and experience that trip.  The strength of this video is the brilliant photography and editing and the way it features one of Mother Nature's greatest feats - the Pacific coastline.  If you're a car person you will love this video and it will inspire you to take a ROAD TRIP!!",1433548800,,1107,4.532663316582915
8692998,5,B00QU7LQ78,"The guys had fun making this, and that's readily apparent. Incredible what they were able to do on such a shoestring budget.",1432080000,,124,4.681818181818182
