529927,4,6302993709,"I first knew about this short British film (from the mid 1950s) from inheriting the soundtrack LP from my parents in the early to mid 1960s. The soundtrack consisted of musical variations on the famous Christmas song each one depicting one of the daily gifts.  The wonderful, lively score was written by the female British composer Doreen Carwithen, who was the amanuensis to the Britsh composer William  Alwyn. Muir Mattheson conducted the score on both the film and LP.  Listening to the one side of the mono MGM LP that included the whole 25+ minute soundtrack was like hearing a cartoon without the video. The liner notes were kind of ambiguous about what was on the screen, so I could only imagine what the film was like.  It wasn't until a couple years ago that I discovered that a VHS copy of the film was sold but only in the USA.
  The film largely met my expectations.  It is a ballet, really, very much in the style of Charlie Chaplin silent films IMO. Unfortunately, the transfer on this tape is rather poor.  I suspect this may have been an unauthorized release as the colors are not right. (My copy shows an address in North Carolina.) Like an old Ecktachrome (sic) slide, the colors have turned various shades of red. Also the copy they used was not in great condition as there is one nasty looking splice in the middle.  To make things worse, the tape was done at the slowest speed, EP.  In my experience, all commercially made VHS tapes were issued at the fast speed.  When I got my copy in late 2008, the prices were very reasonable.  I'm not sure why the wild inflation of the selling prices offered since.  The buyer must decide for himself whether the tape is worth the high price.
  Lastly, a note on Wendy Toye, the main star and director of this film. She had an interesting career as a ballet dancer, choreographer as well as film director.  Check out her page at Wikeapedia.  I note also that she died in late February 2010 at the grand age of 92 !  There are three good obits from the London papers that you can read online.  Alas, she refused to write an autobiography in spite of the urging of friends and colleagues.
  This film and others by Toye cry out for better transfers than this.  There are a number of Toye films that have not been published at all.  Now, with her recent passing, maybe we will see some things come out of the vaults.",1273017600,6,2373,4.454756380510441

7833353,3,6302993709,"I've seen this movie in 16mm, and the quality was wonderful. A remastering into DVD would make so many people happy. This Christmas delight would easily become a raucous visual tradition for the whole family to enjoy each year. You will never sing the Twelve Days of Christmas quite the same way ever again.",1394064000,4,307,4.703703703703703
7833354,4,6302993709,"Watched this old 1950's movie on reel to reel film from the library as a kid with my family at christmas.  We would all gather christmas eve - my extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends and after a polish christmas eve dinner - we would often view this film.
Although the quality is not that great I brought back great memories.  I had my kids (who are now adults) watch it with me as a new tradition.  When my turn to host christmas eve dinner at my house rolls around (every third year) I will share it with the same family members that are still surviving and saw it 40-50 years ago!
Guess you can fine just about anything on amazon.",1389916800,,651,4.276422764227642
7833355,1,6302993709,"Although I purchased a VHS, used copy of this tape, the tape was in very poor shape.  At times is would stop and was unbearable to watch, colors fading, picture jumping and skipping,  At a cost of $20 this tape was defenitly not worth the cost.  I felt cheated that a tape in such poor shape would be sold at such a high price.",1327104000,,327,4.078125
7833356,5,6302993709,"I saw this movie in the original format which was 16mm film back in the 1960s. It has been transfered from the 16mm format to VHS tape and the picture looks as good as the original. I first played the tape on my old machine and the picture was terrible. Playing it on a less used tape player and the picture was as good as the original film. My suggestion is to CLEAN THE HEADS of your VHS player; maybe try a less used player.
Keep in mind this is NOT a DVD and the picture will be that of a VHS tape.
Picture quality reminds me of the ""Mary Poppins"" quality picture and not the latest special effects movie. I have been looking for this movie since the 1960s; now I found it. Will show it to a seniors group before Christmas. They will love it.",1318032000,,746,4.081632653061225
