962514,1,6305086818,"This movie was horrible. I can't believe I wasted fifty cents to rent this straight-to-video flop! If your going to make a spoof of ""The Godfather"", MAKE A DECENT ONE! Anyways, I believe this has been done before, with ""Mafia"". ""Mafia"" was a far better spoof than this one. If you are looking for a movie of this sort, please, stay FAR AWAY from this one, and rent ""Mafia"" instead.
Rodney Dangerfield and Dom Deluise need better material to work with. They were desperate for money. This movie is so dumb that I cannot believe it was allowed to be filmed and sent out to the public! Who wrote this filth? A second grader? I could go on and on about how horrifyingly stupid this waste of celluloid is, but I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Then again, don't even give this movie a second thought.

965133,1,6305086818,"The script, that is.  And it is a crime that you can't rate a film ZERO stars as this one deserves.

One would not think you could get such consistently funny people as Dom Deluise, Rodney Dangerfield and Dom Irrera to turn in poor performances in a genre so ripe for a good natured ribbing -- but somehow, writer/directer Bob Hoge manages to do just that.

If you truly love ""Kids In The Hall"" and think that it was the highest high point in the history of comedy, perhaps you will like this film just because of the presence of Kevin McDonald.  But based on some of the other reviews here, I guess that even his presence doesn't necesarily carry this film even for KITH fans.  For those like me who didn't care much for KITH (I'll admit it did have its moments...), there is absolutely nothing in this film to save it.

Rodney Dangerfield does some of his ""I don't get no respect"" shtick, but in a lackluster and utterly pointless way in regards to the so-called script.  All it does in this case is detract from the character of the film's main antagonist.  Dom Deluise turns in the only halfway decent performance in this turkey and then only when he is playing it straight rather than for laughs.  He DOES do a great ""Godfather"" impression, but that is not what this genre calls for -- it calls for a Godfather PARODY.  And his pointless double-appearence as both ""The Oddfather"" and himself in one scene is simply that... pointless.  And confusing.  It is only there to point out that the imbecile writer thought it was funny to note that ""Don"" sounds like ""Dom.""

About halfway through the film one of the comic stage's great performers (Dom Irrera) appears as himself, doing part of his comedy club bit.  ""Ah, now at last it will get funny!"" I thought, only to be dissapointed again.  His only purpose in the film is to be heckled before he can get any good material out there, and then he slugs Kevin McDonald in the face.  A perfectly understandable thing to do as I certainly wanted to do the same as well by this point, but utterly un-funny and again without any rhyme or reason as to why it would be in the script.  And if you are wondering why I didn't put ""SPOILER WARNING"" before that, it was because this whole thing is spoiled by itself, I can do nothing at all to make it any worse than it was.

I will admit. I cracked a smile from a couple of the lines.  But beyond that, I feel that watching this film was an utter and complete waste of an irretrievable hour and a half of my life.  I used to think that ""Doctor Detroit"" was the worst failure at comedy filmmaking in cinema history and that ""Call The Cops"" was the worst waste of comedic talent in a film (John Candy), but I may have to revise those opinions now.  I only spent $1.99 on this DVD at the supermarket checkout stand, and I am very sorry I spent that much.  It is not even worth foisting off on some poor sucker for free at the flea market.  I would flush this piece of $#!+ down the toilet if I didn't think that porcelain fixture would vomit it back up as a result.

Save your money and don't even look at the jacket of this bomb.  I can honestly say that no matter how long I may live, I will *NEVER* see another Bob Hoge film.  Ever.",1167177600,7,3222,4.293046357615894
965134,5,6305086818,"(At least I act like a kid.)

This movie is not for everyone, unless everyone is like me, in which case they should all see it right away.

First of all: the plot really doesn't matter much at all, so if you're going to see this movie, either you need to appreciate plotless movies, or be a big fan of Kevin McDonald (it's a dream come true!). Though the subtle hints that maybe the plot will come into play later is nothing less than hilarious, and Frito Calzone appearing throughout the movie is worth purchasing it alone, in my opinion.

But if you're a Rodney Dangerfield fan (who isn't very easily pleased), you might be disappointed, as he's hardly in the movie. But he does diver a few classic lines, and is as funny as ever.

Some of it is hit and miss, but if it hits, it's laugh out loud funny. For instance, the school Guppy is sent to, to learn the tricks of the trade- it's a school teaching people how to partake in many illegal activities, and right in plain sight, too. Somehow, the teachers seemed remarkably realistic as they were quizzing their students on killing techniques. It was comedic genius, in my opinion, though some people might find it drab and dragging.

This movie is random, insane, out of control and I love it. If you're into wacky humour, like maybe, ""Wrongfully Accused"", then I'm sure you'll fall in love with The Godson. If you're into Kevin McDonald hooking up with beautiful girls and being the cutest, wimpiest Mafia Boss in perhaps all of history, I'm sure this movie's for you. And finally, if you're into creepy stalkers who trail around menacingly for absolutely no reason and dinosaurs in taxi cabs, I'm sure that you'll enjoy this one!",1117670400,14,1684,4.562913907284768
