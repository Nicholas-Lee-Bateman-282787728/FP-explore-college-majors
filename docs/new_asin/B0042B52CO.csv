8413409,5,B0042B52CO,"I enjoyed watching this and what a shame that season 5 is the last ever season ever made. Really taking in the seas around the pacific which is great to see. What they do and why.
I think that this is really cool job to do.",1325894400,,223,3.869565217391304
8413410,5,B0042B52CO,GREAT! Sea Patrol is one of the best shows there is.  I bought a DVD player to be able to accept the format and plan to purchase every season available.  I already own 1-4.  I hear season 5 will be their last but hope they will reconsider and there will be more.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE SEA PATROL.,1289865600,7,291,4.142857142857143
