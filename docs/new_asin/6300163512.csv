7803901,5,6300163512,"I simply cannot overstate what an excellent episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" ""Beaks"" would have made. I consider ""Beaks"" more a precursor proto-""Birdemic"" (James Nguyen would love the completely insane ecological angle here) than a successor to ""The Birds."" The entire cast and crew of ""Beaks"" combined displays less talent than Tippy Hedren's left pinky toe. You just cannot believe how inept this film is until you've seen it. I cannot imagine why it's never been released on DVD.

The film opens with very unpleasant footage of shooting actual birds which will have you pulling for the birds immediately. Shortly thereafter we meet our heroes Vanessa (Michelle Johnson) and Peter (Christopher Atkins) as a vapid and self-important television reporter and her cameraman lackey boyfriend who only serve to annoy. When her first story is about killer chickens (no, really) you know she's well established on the worldwide marauding poultry beat. She has great lines that are actually some of the best written dialogue in the film, like ""I'm a journalist, not a sideshow barker,"" and ""I majored in journalism in college, not animal husbandry!"" She says these things with the same indignity that DeForest Kelley used to proclaim his medical qualifications in the original ""Star Trek"".  Let's just say it now: Michelle Johnson is a terrible actress. She is not alone in this film, nor is she the worst thespian to appear here. That the whole thing was written, directed by, and produced by Rene Cardona, Jr. should send shivers down the spine of any B-movie aficionado. It is a Peruvian, Mexican, and Puerto Rican production with very low costs, but largely takes place in Italy. Of course.

Investigating the avian killers, Vanessa and Peter scour the globe for leads. One of the first involves a demonstration of a man being attacked by a bloodthirsty canary in a church. I am totally not making that up. The bird carnage then picks up the pace with lots of pigeon eyeball gouging (and strangely amusing eyebrow plucking) interspersed with some of the worst dialogue I have seen in any movie made since Ed Wood made ""Glen Or Glenda."" (There is even a scene where the appropriately named Peter talks to a specific part of his anatomy in a bathtub. Yikes!) The very worst dialogue involves a reprehensible family getting a flat tire on a beach and not having a tire iron for their jack. This doesn't sound like interesting subject matter for a reason. The father in that scene is definitely the worst actor in the movie and may have actually been made out of wood given the way he delivered his lines. Watch for it and weep. This family escapes into a sturdy concrete structure away from the birds, but in one of a series of questionable plot contrivances, elects to leave the building to hide under a pier so they can dive under the water if attacked by the birds. What? Really? That's Cardona's best idea? My idea would be for the bird army to send in the ducks to finish them off, but I'm bitter about this whole experience. That this is followed by a musical hang gliding scene gone horribly awry is almost too much to bear.

Despite the unintentional comedy on full display here, it does have to be said that this movie is slow. (Pacing? What?) The film is also riddled with ludicrous plotpoints and lack of continuity, like when Vanessa, seeking a higher answer to her questions about killer poultry, says ""it's been a long time since I was in a church, would you go with me?"" to Peter. Weren't they just in a church with a killer canary about half an hour back? She has terrible short term memory, which is perhaps why she is employed as a television journalist.

The bird attacks get progressively more out of control and we learn it's all because of man's lack of ecological awareness (it was made before the global warming hysteria spawned about a zillion shot on video monster movies). See pigeons attack a birthday cake! See the stupidest child in the world, Patty, bring on wanton talon slashing with her party horn! Find out why Christopher Atkins has to exclaim ""We've got to move those sheep out of the way!"" (Hint: it involves a train and a pair of pliers. Oh, just don't ask....) Ponder why somebody put an untrained, panicky journalist with the IQ of a can of drain cleaner in charge of the bird escape train! Discover which force prevails in the epic battle between birds and train!

No, never mind. You won't find any answers here, you know why? Because the attacks just stop. Vanessa wraps up the movie with an unbelievably ponderous monologue about man versus the birds and reveals that the birds just stopped their aggression as quickly as they started their reign of terror. Cardona even serves up an ending so ham-handed that it invokes countless earlier bad movies, most notably the carrot uprising at the end of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", but here instead of carrots rising from the ground Cardona gives us masses of mosquitoes set to take on the human race. That makes sense I guess, I certainly like mosquitoes less than doves, even in their primal bloodthirsty form as seen in ""Beaks"".

Now that I have explained exactly why ""Beaks"" is one of the most inept horror films of the 1980s (and that's saying something), let me briefly justify my five star review. Every single frame of ""Beaks"" is incompetently made and acted, the writing is ponderous and pretentious, the acting is embarrassing, and the production values and effects are bottom of the barrel. The key point is that Cardona and company were sincere when they made this mess, and it shows. They wanted to make a scary monster movie and cash in on one of the hot trends of the mid-80s; they just couldn't make it work within their budget and capabilities. The result is unintentionally hilarious, and fans of ""MST3K"", ""Cinematic Titanic"", or ""RiffTrax"" will rejoice at this film. There isn't a scene that's not worth laughing at and the cult movie quotient is very high. If you like movies so bad they're good, you will be thrilled with ""Beaks"". It's a national treasure...in Peru.",1432425600,4,6084,4.766603415559772
7803902,4,6300163512,"While one day looking through a VHS dollar bin at a no-name podunk store in a no-name podunk town I came across this little gem, Beaks: The Movie. How awesomely bad was this film. It's a Mexican directed film, staring two American Actors, Michelle Johnson & Chris Atkins. That already starts the language/culture barrier in the piece that leaves you confused to the point of laughter. Turns out it was released as a sequel to Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" in Italy. The two play TV reporters covering stories around the globe of wild bird attacks, leaving countless victims. If you think pigeons and chickens killing people in slo-motion are funny, and if you think the lead portagonist talking to his penis is oscar-worthy, see this film.",1162166400,4,732,4.864
