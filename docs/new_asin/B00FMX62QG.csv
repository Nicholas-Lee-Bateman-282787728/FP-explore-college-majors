6015267,5,B00FMX62QG,"Have had this video set for a few months now...  I like to ""play"" with my food...textures, flavors, aromas, etc...  Chef Todd makes it FUN and EASY...and some of the basic skill sets have served me well.  True story:  Several weeks ago we were guests at a buffet dinner at a friend's home.  Everything was going well until the hostess realized she was way behind schedule while tending to her guests.  She had planned an elegant white wine sauce to be served with the chicken, but there was simply no time.  I jumped right in and whipped up a creamy white wine with horseradish and tarragon sauce in less than 10 minutes.  I, literally, just winged it as I went along.  Never in a million years would I have attempted something like that before soaking up Chef Todd's course...especially in someone else's kitchen.  Everyone wanted the recipe...  For my birthday two weeks ago, my host and hostess gave me a real chef's jacket with ""Chef Dave"" beautifully embroidered on it.  I am way to humble to wear it...but I know if I keep on with Chef Todd's mini-course I will someday feel like a chef...and maybe even don that beautiful gift.  You're parents and grownups were all WRONG growing up with admonishments of ""Don't play with your food...""  Now I love playing with my food... Now I only use a recipe to get a hint of an idea...and just wing it.  Thank You, Chef Todd for setting me free.

6015268,5,B00FMX62QG,"I wanted to learn to cook  - so I bought recipe books, magazines and watched youtube... Everyone wanted me to do their recipe. No one wanted to teach me HOW to cook. Then I ran into Chef Todd Mohr - his style about burning the recipe surprised me, and wow, have I learned a lot! I can now walk into the kitchen, assemble meals with favor profiles in mind, not following recipes. What is most amazing about him, is he can teach via video - not hands on, not long drills. I have watched a video, then completed the meal. His wit, humor and talent shows through on each video.",1380844800,,573,4.209090909090909
6015269,5,B00FMX62QG,"Chef Todd Mohr starts with basic methods and moves on from there.  He is deliberate and patient and will guide you every step along your new cooking path toward a ""no recipe"" cooking style.  He is entertaining and funny and full of culinary tips and tricks.  This is a great way to learn to cook even if you've been cooking over 40 years (like me!).  Also makes a great gift.",1380844800,,375,4.314285714285714
6015270,5,B00FMX62QG,"First I thought, ""yeah right"" sounds to good to be true.  I purchased the Burn Your Recipes DVD set just to see if what was advertised would be delivered.  To my amazement it was & more!  And I do mean more... Chef Todd does not hold back anything.  You learn because he makes it interesting & fun.  You really learn.  As described in other reviews here you become aware in so many aspects of cooking that when talking with people, grocery personnel & other chef's and restaurant staff they know - ""you know.""

The fear is taken away and you become unleashed.  It makes sense and you are able to navigate around the kitchen, the market and your own mind for creative opportunity.

Food is a common denominator among people...being able to prepare and enjoy with family and friends takes on a whole different meaning.  Food Handling is as important as Food preparation and Chef Todd brings you up to speed.  In fact if you go to the National Restaurant Home page you can take a Food Handling Course online for only $15 and receive a ServSafe Certificate - but Chef Todd's instruction will help you to grasp it all and much faster than you think possible now.

I don't call myself a novice anymore and it drives my wife nuts!  Chef Todd's course will help you among your family cooks and they will see & marvel at your grasp of how to cook it up right!

I started with the Burn Your Recipe DVD's.  I now own every DVD he sells.  It's good to review them as needed and reinforce earlier learning...that's a benefit of having the DVD.

When you order on line you always take a chance & I hesitated at first.  I can honestly report this was one of the best online purchases I've ever made.  I went back to Chef Todd over & over again buying the different DVD's because he established a trust as an educator, Chef & man of his word!!!

In case it sounds like I'm holding back on my praise I'm sorry.  These products are great and I highly suggest you take advantage of what he so willingly shares.

There is another option for an online cooking class with a monthly fee but personally I don't like monthly fees & haven't done that.  But I have enjoyed every video clip he sent inviting me to enjoy that online course.

If your goal is to learn, improve or both and be entertained while learning look no further.  This is what you are looking for.  Thank you so much Chef Todd!",1380844800,,2370,4.366132723112128
6015271,5,B00FMX62QG,"This is an indirect review of the Chef Mohr's DVD. I purchased the DVDs as a gift after having taken his Web Cooking Classes.

Before stumbling across Chef Mohr's many youtube offerings I had been predominantly a seat of the pants outdoor cooker. I had used just about every sort of outdoor pit/grill/cooker there is and had cooked most every common BBQ beast/fish/fowl and side dish there is, boiled crawdads, fried turkeys, you name it. I had learned by watching and doing and experimenting with plenty of trial and failure. I was fearless and, eventually, got pretty good at cooking darn near anything outdoors over real fire.

But when it came to using the kitchen hotbox I was a total abstainer - ""Manly men cook outdoors or order pizza."" is what I'd tell people. But in reality, it was that my fearlessness stopped at the backdoor. All of my prior attempts to cook with stove or oven following other people's recipes yielded poor to awful results. Despite lots of googling and youtubing, kitchen success eluded me...to the point that I was actually afraid of staking my cooking reputation, such as it was, on anything I might attempt in the kitchen...so pizza instead.

THEN I FOUND CHEF TODD MOHR on youtube saying ""burn your recipes"" and learn HOW TO COOK. His methods and presentation made more sense to me than anything else I'd read or watched. So I signed up for his web class. I learned the science behind different cooking methods, the proper use of myriad kitchen tools and hardware, how to choose ingredients to achieve the desired results, how to experiment and be creative with a high likelihood of success. Most importantly he taught me to think of a recipe as more of a suggestion than a rigorous plan. I now get ideas from a recipe, but then use the knowledge and techniques Chef Mohr taught me in order to arrive at my own rendition of the dish. He informed, challenged and motivated me to embrace all kinds of cooking - and did it with a sense of humor. I'm now the Head Chef in our family - indoors or out - and I'm passing this stuff along to my 16 yr old son who picks up a knife and spatula on occasion as well. I can't remember the last time we ordered pizza.

I'm a swim coach so I spend a good portion of my day looking for ways to give my athletes information they need for success, to teach them to experiment creatively, to motivate them to their best endeavor...and I try to do all this in a fun, compelling manner and with a bit of humor mixed in. Chef Mohr has done precisely these things for me when it comes to cooking so I've come to think of him as ""Coach"" Mohr. You will too. Get the DVDs (yes, I've watched them and they are true to his web cooking class form) - you won't be disappointed.",1380844800,,2731,4.445109780439122
6015272,5,B00FMX62QG,"Chef Todd certainly shows you a new way to cook.  I used to depend on cookbooks and have quite a collection.  After watching the ""burn your recipe"" set, they just collect dust.
He is full of energy and motivates me to not be afraid of experimenting on my own.  He also showed me i had alot to learn about the proper pan and knife to use for the job.  I actually look forward to cooking dinner and my family actually looks forward to eating it!",1380844800,,443,4.176470588235294
6015273,5,B00FMX62QG,"Frustrated in the kitchen? No more if you watch ""Burn your Recipes"" Chef Todd is fun to watch and you will be more confident at the stove. From what pans to use and how to use a knife. The simple things you learn to make a great meal, you will be able to impress you dinner guest with a great meal.  After watching these DVDs you will want all of his DVDs.  Enjoy the journey with Chef Todd, I know I have and will continue to do so.",1380844800,,433,3.909090909090909
6015274,5,B00FMX62QG,"I graduated from college, moved out on my own and needed to learn how to cook. This DVD series taught me everything FROM THE BEGINNING - what knives to buy, how many pots and pans you actually need, how to cut an onion and a pepper. By learning correctly from the beginning and then building my knowledge with a really solid base I now can create meals no problem, blend flavors, and impress my buddies when I see them stumbling trying to cook. A few things I've learned:

1. You don't cook meat 3 minutes on one side and 5 on the next, you cook them to an internal temperature (ex. chicken is 160 degrees) I no longer worry about the time on one side because I know you cook it until it is done - 160 degrees - i carry a cheap thermometer.
2. There are veggies you should cook in oils and veggies you should cook in water. If you mess this up, the veggies will loose their nutritional value and you won't be eating as well as you think.
3. Buy a pan with a ""foot"" so that after you cook a protein on it you can add a cold liquid like wine to deglaze the pan to make a quick sauce and the pan won't warp.
4. I know how to correctly cut veggies which totally changed my meal time prep. He teaches you BASIC knife skills that after you learn and see other people stumble with you thank him every time.
5. The 3rd DVD is really cool because he explains how to blend flavors and fix flavors. For example, if something is too salty add an acid like a lime. I have saved a lot of dishes using these techniques and improved many more.

If you suck at cooking, watch these because he explains everything as a science and makes sure you know what's going on before he moves on to the next. I have bought this DVD set for family and friends because it taught me a life skill I will have for the rest of my life.",1380844800,5,1801,4.070422535211268
6015275,5,B00FMX62QG,"Chef Todd is a joy to learn from. I have always cooked at home, but never really understand what I was doing past following recipes. Chef Todd shows you the techniques you need to cook like the pros do - using items you already have on-hand. Everything is explained very simply and demonstrated so you know exactly what to do. You feel like he is right there cooking with you in the kitchen. He is different from normal ""celebrity chefs"" because he truly has a passion for teaching you to cook and focuses on the science of cooking rather than just showing you how to make a few specific meals. I would highly recommend this DVD set for any cook looking to take their cooking to the next level and bring more delicious and healthy meals to their family's dinner table.",1380844800,,768,4.453900709219858
8616979,5,B00FMX62QG,"I purchased all 3 volumes through his website. After seeing some of his videos online, I was able to make the decision to purchase the hefty dvd set of $97. It is worth every penny!. My family and I watched the first volume and loved it. He explains things clearly, with a ton of enthusiasm and he teachers things in a very organized manner. I highly recommend this volume set for those that want to have a sharp edge in their cooking skills. It is basically learning the cooking methods from cooking school at home!.",1412812800,,517,4.4526315789473685
8616980,5,B00FMX62QG,"I was addicted to recipes. I had to have every item on the ingredient list or I wouldn't try it. I would follow the recipe line by line, and working this way I made some very good meals. After using Chef Todd's videos I have broken my addiction. I still use recipes, but mainly for inspiration. I can pick them apart, recognize the basic methods used, and substitute when I want to. But what I think is most fun is I don't need recipes at all. I can go to the market, find foods that look good and make a meal using those basic methods. My cooking is greatly improved and I'm more confident in the kitchen.

Chef Todd makes the learning process fun. The videos are well-constructed, to the point, and show what is expected at each point of the cooking process. I continue to refer back to them and expect that I will continue to do so for many years.",1381363200,5,850,4.246913580246914
8616981,5,B00FMX62QG,"CHEF TODD PRESENTS THE INFORMATION FOR THE BEGGINER OR EXPERT IN AN INFORMATIVE WAY. THESE DVDS HAVE MADE ME LOOK AT FOOD PRODUCTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THIS HAS ALLOWED ME TO OVERCOME MY INHIBITIONS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DECIDE WHAT TO MAKE FOR MEALS. MY WIFE AND I HAVE USED HIS TECHNIQUES AND IDEAS TO CREATE MEALS THAT ALWAYS COME OUT DELICIOUS, EVEN MY 12YO SON ENJOYS THEM WITHOUT COMPLAINTS. I THINK CHEF TODD HAS EVEN STIMULATED MY SONS THOUGHT PROCESS TO FOOD. WELL DONE CHEF TODD AND THANKS..",1381276800,,500,4.5054945054945055
8616982,5,B00FMX62QG,"Chef Todd's DVDs are excellent for both beginner thru seasoned pro.  The info is presented logically, easy to follow and best of all, if at first you don't succeed, you can always watch again - the whole video or just the pieces you need!  I have been a member of Chef Todd's Cooking club for several years.  Although I am a very good cook in my own right, I still learn new techniques or shortcuts when I watch his DVD's!  Definitely worth the investment.",1380931200,,456,4.392857142857143
8616983,5,B00FMX62QG,"This set is a must have for learning some very helpful tips whether you're a seasoned cook or just looking to be better in the kitchen. The set is entertaining and informative and will leave you with the clear and confident ability to cook by method as well as by recipe. You will be weaned from the need for recipes and from the confusion they often bring. Recipes are short hand notes on ingredients and order of approach to making a meal but don't actually tell you how to make/cook a dish or meal and many of the variables in a recipe are imprecise and often lead to disastrous results. This will be avoided forever after watching this three part set of how to cook without recipes! Over  20 methods on how to prepare, cook with the scientific, precise indicators on when to move onto the next step, how food acts and reacts in the many conditions it is put into in the kitchen so you will be educated on how to cook virtually any dish. This set will not let you down and I highly recommend it.",1380931200,,998,4.308510638297872
8616984,5,B00FMX62QG,"I have been a personal chef for many years, even owned a small restaurant, but decided to buy this DVD set to refresh my methods.  What a pleasant surprise for me to watch Chef Todd in his element, teaching you just how food evolves during the cooking process.  Over the years I had lost the ability to see the big picture that's out there, paying more attention to a small menu repertoire rather than opening up my world to new ideas. After watching and learning from this DVD collection, I have regained my love of food preparation; my mind swims with new ideas when I'm in the grocery looking at all the produce and possibilities for meals.  This DVD set will instill a confidence in you and your cooking like never before.  It has given new life to my cooking and will change the way you cook, or the way you feel about cooking, forever.  When you know what indicators to watch for, nothing will intimidate you in the kitchen again.  Now that's a feeling of freedom that is life changing!  Buy the DVD set, for yourself and for gifts -- it's the best thing you can do to elevate your cooking to cook like a chef.",1380931200,3,1116,4.36231884057971
8616985,5,B00FMX62QG,"I have had these videos for a few years. They changed the way I cook. I didn't know there was so much I didn't know about the basics of cooking. Chef Todd doesn't teach you a recipe, he teaches you about cooking. I always say there are 2 kinds of teachers; those who want you to learn and absorb their knowledge and those that want to impress you by how much they know. Chef Todd is the former.
Learn basic cooking methods and free yourself from following recipes that someone else has created to their tastes. Learn knife skills. No you don't know how to cut fruits, vegetables and protein products. Chef Todd will teach you. Learning knife skills has been the most fun part for me. You've seen pictures in magazines of perfectly sliced and diced food. Chef Todd will teach you how it's done. These skills also help you to cook food consistently. I learned about what happens to food ingredients as they cook. This just opens up my mind about cooking. I now get ideas for dinner from recipes and I tweak the recipes to my family's desired tastes. One drawback to learning from chef Todd, I spend way too much time in the produce section. I see all those vegetables and so many ideas go through my head I want to buy and cook everything there. Get these videos, you won't be disappointed. What you learn can be applied to whatever you are cooking.",1380931200,,1347,4.435483870967742
8616986,5,B00FMX62QG,"Chef Todd Mohr changed my life, and he will change yours too. I bought these DVD's for my 9 year old son who aspires to be a chef. I found myself drawn into what is really a culinary school crash course. Chef Todd just makes learning so entertaining and non-intimidating. Now I feel like I can experiment and understand what I am doing in the kitchen. Bye, bye, processed foods. Simple, beautiful, and healthy. This is what Chef Todd will show you how to do. My son knows more about cooking method than 95% of the adults I know. This is an eye opener, for real. Chef Todd is the man! Buy these DVD's! Learn the methods and burn your recipes!",1380844800,,641,4.305785123966942
8616987,5,B00FMX62QG,"Dear Chef Todd,
I have loved every lesson and all your CDs. Listening and watching you is very relaxing yet very interesting, so learning is optimal. You have covered so many methodologies and because I'm a life member I can revisit your website and quickly look up any technique I need to refresh. Whether you are an everyday busy cook or not, watching you demonstrate techniques and tips instead of just recipes is a great concept. As you rightly say, each of your techniques can mean 100s of different recipes simply by taking your basic method and changing ingredients, seasonings and serving. Thank you very much for all your wonderful generosity, hard work and enthusiasm for wanting to share and make me a better cook in my own kitchen. Please keep up your great work as I'm sure there are so many that are very grateful and just love your Cooking Coarse. Take Care, Andrea",1380844800,,880,4.683870967741935
8616988,5,B00FMX62QG,"I have been cooking for many years and have always believed that a recipe must be followed exactly as written if it is to come out right.  Thanks to Chef Mohr I have learned how to  improvise ingredients to put together great tasting dishes with confidence.  For me, knowing how to use what I have on hand to create new and interesting meals has certainly given me 'Freedom in the Kitchen'.  Also using ingredients you already have saves money on a daily basis.  Thank you Chef Mohr!",1380844800,,483,4.505747126436781
