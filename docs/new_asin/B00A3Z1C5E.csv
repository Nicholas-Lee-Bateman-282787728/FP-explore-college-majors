8546611,1,B00A3Z1C5E,No one in the QC Dept.obviously didn't check out this DVD.  This inexcusible error is a real pity since the content has some of the rarest of all Benny Goodman performances. I sure would like to see this error corrected and notify me and other purchasers that we can replace this stupid mistake.,1363564800,10,295,4.566037735849057
