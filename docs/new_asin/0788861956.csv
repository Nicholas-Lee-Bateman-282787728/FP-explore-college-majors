82172,5,0788861956,"Yes, my favorite show Desperate Housewives - The Complete Second Season will be released later this summer. I loved the second season more than the first, better storylines, and the characters found their nitch. Marcia Cross deserves an Emmy come this fall, her character Bree had some year, her husband died due to that creepy and love to hate pharmacist, she started to date him, he ended up killing himself, didn't call the ambulance to help him, she battled with the bottle, her son Andrew sued her, and then he slept with her AA sponsor (her son is gay), Bree left her son in the middle of nowhere after that, and then her daughter Danielle tried to run off with a killer. Boy that's some juicy drama. Well if I haven't confused you enough, the DVD collection has deleted scenes and other features to heat up your summer. Don't miss out on this fabulous show, order your copy today!",1149120000,7,887,4.584905660377358
82173,4,0788861956,"Well, the second season of ""Desperate Housewives"" has finally come to an end. Season two for the most part was a pretty good one, though not quite as good as season one. While the writing and acting was still first-rate, there were a few things about season two that didn't work.

The good things about the second season of this terrific ABC series were many of the same things that made this show's first season so good: great acting by its stars. The actress I thought who came off best in season two was Eva Longoria, who plays the beautiful and sexy Gabrielle. Of the show's four leading ladies, Longoria gave by far the funniest performances throughout the season (her catfight scene with that nun midway through the season was uproarious). Marcia Cross gave the show's most powerful performances as Bree, the housewive who's an obsessive perfectionist. Felicity Huffman (Lynette) and Teri Hatcher (Susan) were both terrific as usual. And Nicolette Sheridan was delicious as Edie, the Wisteria Lane tramp. Main storylines that played out through season two include: Gaby and Carlos trying to have a baby in every possible way; Lynette going back to work; Bree battling not only alcoholism but also her brat son Andrew; Susan breaking up with Mike, then finding a potential romantic interest with a doctor; and Edie finding romance with Susan's ex-husband Karl.

But there were a few setbacks. The one asset that didn't really work on the second season of ""Desperate Housewives"" was the big mystery storyline involving Wisteria Lane's newest members: the Applewhites (introduced at the end of season one). This storyline wasn't even close to matching the greatness of the big mystery storyline of season one (the suicide of Mary Alice Young), and it wasted the talents of Alfre Woodard, who portrayed Betty Applewhite. It seemed that the writers couldn't make up their minds at where to go with this story, and in the process Woodard wasn't given much to do in the role. That's a shame, because Woodard is a great actress and deserved better here. This storyline was thankfully finished off in the season two finale, and it appears that Woodard will not be back for season three. One good thing came out of this storyline: a surprise twist that I didn't see coming.

Another thing I didn't see coming was the shocking ending to the season finale, which has turned out to be the big cliffhanger that will lead into season three. It will be interesting to see what ends up happening when ""Desperate Housewives"" comes back on the air for season three.

Critics loved season one; but hated season two. Same thing with the Emmy voters. After receiving 15 Emmy nominations for its freshman season, ""Desperate Housewives"" only got 7 nods for season two. Plenty of omissions this time: no nomination for Best Comedy Series, and no nominations for its leading ladies (Marcia Cross was unfairly snubbed). The only major nomination it got was for Alfre Woodard as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, which (in my opinion) makes no sense at all. The only reason why Woodard is nominated is because Emmy voters love her. She is a past winner for some very good work that's she's done (the HBO movie Miss Evers' Boys and a guest appearence in the pilot to NBC's L.A. Law) and she's received other nominations for her other various roles. But to receive a nomination for a role in which we saw her not given a whole lot to do just proves at how boneheaded the Emmy voters can be sometimes (which is quite often). How Woodard can get a nomination for a wasted performance and Cross fails to get nominated for doing the strongest acting on the show in season two is a mystery that I don't think anyone on Wisteria Lane would be able to figure out.",1148256000,64,3742,4.761171032357473
82174,5,0788861956,"Desperate Housewives is one of the best TV shows (along with Lost and Greys Anatomy) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like Desperate Housewives. Desperate Housewives is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. With a great balance of comedy and suspense this show just makes you want to see whats going to happen next. I give Disney a lot of credit for putting so much in to there DVD sets. Desperate Housewives The Complete Second Season will come out in late August of 2006 and it will include all 24 episodes and will presented in widescreen format along with a 5.1 Surround Sound.

Below are the Bonus Features according to the press release from Buena Vista/Disney.

82356,5,0788861956,"After its extreme popularity back in 2004-2005, and the numerous awards it got for the quality of its first season, it became inevitable that the second season of Desperate Housewives would suffer comparisons with its first season and be a subject of backlash, and drop of ratings, from the medias and the ""sheeps"" in the public. It happened with South Park, Beavis and Butthead, so this is no surprise that it happened again with Desperate Housewives.

Unlike some critics who said that it was the worst season, I believe that the second season was awesome. Though there were a few comments that were right. Such as how the Housewives, whom we were so used to see them speak and talk together, were spending, starting from the second episode, a bit too much time separated from each other, having plot lines which didn't intertwine with them. And how for Susan Mayer became less interesting and more annoying. So much that I first wondered, sorry Teri Hatcher, if it wouldn't have been better if Susan Mayer got shot by ... at the start of the first episode and became the new narrator so to speak. But then again, her stories became better, although I wasn't too fond of how she got separated from Mike. And considering the special contents in the DVD, where they present some abandoned plot lines for Susan that got shot and abandoned,( a good thing for it wasn't that much great), I have to say that I would have loved to see more of Susan Mayer work in the series, more episodes on the subject of her publishing career ( eg: story ideas, fans, book sellers, book fairs, etc. and not just for one episode), her art crafts like they did in the fifth season, and less on some goofy situations that I didn't find that much funny. Fortunately for us, Marc Cherry gave more input on his episodes instead and Susan Mayer's life became more interesting, thanks to Edie Britt too.

And back to the subject of the narrator, I have to say that Mary Alice brings an unique voice to the series, which would have lost some of its charm if it had been replaced.

As for this season mystery, I pretty much loved it. Of course, it would have been better had the Applewhites had been more present in the Housewives lives than just some new family who didn't try to be sociable with their neighbors. However, the actors, Alfre Woodard, Nashawne Kearse and Mehcad Brooks, were just excellent and gave a lot of credibility to their mystery. As for its ending, I have to say that I was pretty well surprised.

Among the special guest characters, I have to say that my favorite is Lee Tergesen, who played Bree's new boyfriend for a few episodes. After their story ended, I was a bit disappointed that the writers got rid of Lee's character a bit too quickly, in such a way that we will never get to see him again. It was evident that there was a great chemistry between Lee and Marcia. If any of the Desperate Housewives writers is reading this, I just want to say to them that I would love to see Lee Tergesen's character, Peter Macmillan, back in the series. I adored him.
As much as Helen Rowland, played by Kathryn Harrold, who plays her brilliantly. Her scene with Gabrielle was just amazing as she humiliated Gabrielle and Carlos in a vicious way. Considering how John Rowland is becoming a special guest in the following seasons, maybe the writers could bring her back. She brings a lot of energy.

As much as Marc Cherry, whose talent I believe is the main reason to the success of the series.

See you in the third season.",1271980800,,3514,4.534700315457413

By the commercials I had seen though I had a feeling it would be something I'd like. Recently I've taken the time to watch all four seasons and I'm chomping at the bit now waiting for Season five. I don't know how I'll make it all the way to September!!!

This show is different than most, at least to me. I thought it was going to be more of a ""Soap Opera"" type but it's more of a drama with comic undertones. It'll make you laugh mostly, make you cry sometimes and make you sit there with your mouth hanging open thinking ""I can't believe she did that!"".

All new mysteries happen in this series - as well as the unravveling of some older ones - right from the start. I found this series perhaps even more addictive than the first series, often watching four episodes at a time because it has that ""just one more episode"" feel to it because you just HAVE to know what happens next.

We are introduced to a new Housewife in this series, Betty Applewhite, a women harboring a deep secret and keeps one of her sons locked in the basement.

Things are particularly hard for Bree in this series as she has to deal with both alcoholism and her increasingly chaotic relationship with her her son, Andrew. Lynette's life takes a hectic turn as she struggles with taking care of her unruly kids after her return to work.

82380,5,0788861956,"I shall begin this review by declaring my love for this show. It's my favorite show on the air right now by far, and I think it's one of the greatest television shows ever created. The acting is superb, the storylines intriguing, hilarious and often touching, and there is a strong bond bond between these (now six) very different women that I think everyone can relate to. While I have absolutely loved every season, season two has definitely remained my favorite. That's why it comes as a shock to me that so many critics and even fans bashed this season. I mean, what isn't there to love? All four principle characters' storylines are advanced. Susan's turbulent love life continues as she struggles to maintain her relationship with Mike and also finds romance with a handsome young doctor. In this season we also see Susan try to foster a relationship with her long-lost father and deal with her ex-husband. Lynette goes from being a stay-at-home mom to a working woman, and this storyline is ridiculously entertaining- from Lynette's malicious colleague Nina (I personally found this character to be an irresistable villian) to her immature and incompetent boss Ed. Also in this season, Tom joins Lynette's firm and we see the two struggle to keep their marriage in check while working together. Lynette's struggle to maintain her personal life and career is also a very realistic storyline that I think a lot of people can relate to. Gaby suffers a miscarriage, and after Carlos is released from prison the two go to desperate lengths to have a child. Along the way, Gabrielle must thwart an attempt from a meddlesome nun to ruin her marriage. Perhaps the most interesting storyline of the season belonged to Bree. After Rex's death, we see Bree try to move on by dating George, the pharmacist. After discovering George's sordid secrets, her son Andrew becomes more of a terror than ever and tries to make Bree's life even more miserable. All of this leads to Bree becoming an alcoholic, and by the end of the season, she has resorted to drastic measures to get her life back in order. New on the lane are mysterious neighbors Betty and Matthew Applewhite, who are hiding a dark secret in their basement. As the season progesses, we discover the truth behind this mystery. One of the most scathing critiques of season two regards the Applewhites' storyline. Many said it wasn't captivating and that Betty Applewhite never really integrated into the show. I disagree with both of these claims. Alfre Woodard's Betty Applewhite remains one of my favorite characters during the show's tenure. Not only was the season two mystery captivating; there is an unbelievable shock in the finale. And that's not the only shock in store for viewers; the season has many surprises that all come to fruition in the finale. This finale, which features memorable scenes of each wife's arrival to the lane is my favorite finale of the four seasons (although season four's finale was also pretty incredible, I must say). Not only does season two look back, it also gives us a twist for each major character (in my opinion, the most shocking moment of the entire series thus far occurs with Mike in the final moments of the finale) and leaves you desperate to see how each of the storylines will play out in the third season. So there you have it. Some have said this season was boring. I personally found each and every one of the above storylines captivating and entertaining. As with every season of Desperate Housewives, the acting is superb and the chemistry between the leads undeniable. This leads to another critique of season two that I believe is illegitimate. Many have said that the wives are too isolated from each other in this season. While their scenes together may not be as numerous as other seasons, these scenes are so enjoyable that it doesn't feel like a loss at all. Last but not least, the show's brilliant mix of comedy and drama remains as strong in this season as it did in its classic first season. If you are considering watching this season for the first time, please don't listen to critics. Watch the episodes and judge for yourself. I bet you won't be disappointed.",1217462400,,4185,4.789764868603043
82381,5,0788861956,well what can i say??!-i m hooked on desperate housewives! im on my third season set and cant wait for it to arrive!!my experience with buying the previous sets thru amazon have all been positive ones--i always receive my merchandise in good shape and in minimal time--thanx amazon for letting me enjoy desperate housewives!!,1216512000,,325,5.037037037037037
82382,5,0788861956,"Desperate housewives season 2 was as good, if not better than the original. I must admit that while I was a fan of the the first season it never truly captivated me in anyway. This season did. I think the reason for that was due to a stronger story and range of characters.
I loved Bree in this season, which is not what i found in the first season. Her breavement and conflicts with her son and her internal struggles make her a more rounded out and flawed character. Until she finally cracks (which lets face it, we knew was gonna happen soon.)
Also the character of Gabby was given more to do in this season. As opposed to her just sleeping with her gardener and trying to hide it from her increasly annoying husband.
Lynett's story was also better in this season. I just could not relate to her in the first season. the choices she makes and the situations she puts herself in. And i have kids so i know what being a parent is but still! In this season however she seemed more interesting. Though however I wish she would stop having her silly little fights with her husband and get her own life.
Susan...Susan has always been hard for me to like. In the first season I thought she was OK at first, but after a while down right annoying. In this season she improves a little though she is still just as insane and is still rivalling Carrie Bradshaw!
Another pleasure of this season was the story involving the Applewhites. I found it ten times more interesting than the previous, though the actual mystery could be gathered pretty quickly in this season a few episodes in, unlike the the first season's which kept you guessing right till the  last episode. I also loved the Betty character, but i wish she had more screen time and more background. i was horrifed when there were whole episodes going by and she didn't even feature!!!
Wats that all about?
I wish she hadnt exited the show at the end of the season but hopefully she will make a reappearance in a future season.
I also loved the fact that Mary-Alice barely featured in this season
(apart from her poisoned honey narration). She truly was the most boring and unengaging character on the show.
An annoyance of mine of this season was the fact that Edie, the Samantha Jones of the show (though no where near as cool and clever) was still feeling like a secondary character. Barely in an episode, going some without even making an appearance. They should bring her forward and give her more to do apart from her tedious battles with Susan which she always loses. Another factor that brought this season down was the fact that the main mystery, though revealed to the audience quite early on was only touched upon and noticed by the main charcters nearly half way through the season! Making the mystery itself seem dull and prolonged by the end of the season due to the fact that we the viewers already know or have  guessed the stuff they are discovering in the second leg of the season. Whereas the first season, we the viewers were taken on a journey with the characters and were discovering things with them. And the final thing that annoyed me about this season was the loss of some great characters. The Applewhites, Felicia Tilman, Justin and George Williams.
But apart from my few dislikes of this season, like i said. this season i felt was better than the First. Heres hoping the Third maintains this.",1207267200,,3374,4.5204582651391165

I liked the flashbacks giving life back to dead characters in a lovely way,  especially the ones with Mary-Alice.
I agree, the plot with Caleb was not really absorbing - this is probably why the writers focused more on the main characters lives, and this is a good thing.

82402,5,0788861956,"When Season 2 of Desperate Housewives came out, I admit I was skeptical.  How could such a great show continue into it's path of greatness?  It began with a bumpy start, when we have resolved who the body in Zach's toy chest was and the history behind Mary Alice's suicide.  Where would it go from there?  With the new neighbors and the obvious secret they are hiding in the basement, at the end of the first episode I went from a bit bored to intregued as to the new plot lines.

Susan is continuing her on again off again relationship with Mike, which is the most obvious comic relief of the show.  Lynette has returned to work while her husband sits at home with their horrible children.  Gabrielle's main struggle is her attempt at having a baby with her husband Carlos while trying to keep her affair with the gardener from his suspicious eyes.  All are dodging the neighborhood vamp, Nicolette Sheridan, with jealous eyes.  And Bree.  Poor, perfect Bree.  Struggling with her new alcoholism while holding the whole DYSFUNCTIONAL (and that deserves to be in all capital letters) family together.  Her son Andrew is so evil, so self centered that his presence just radiates like a bad smell.

What is a Desperate Housewife to do?  Continue their chaotic existence and try to make things work.  We see the plots unfold that will continue to the next season - Gabrielle's continued struggle to have a child and this time incorporating their maid (who she catches with Carlos at the season finale), Bree's dumping her son on the side of the road and waiting for his inevitable return, Lynette's frustrations in dealing with her husband and children while balancing a career, and of course, Mike and Susan.

82420,5,0788861956,"Rejuvinating ABC's fortunes along with fellow partners ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Lost"", ""Desperate Houswewives"" is by far a better show than the previous two. It's writing is top notch, acting impeccable and characters are extremely well crafted. What sets this show apart from it's contemporaries is that it can deal with mystery without becoming confusing and muddled (unlike ""Lost"") and it's love stories are more convincing and less whimsical than ""Grey's Anatomy"" and the repulsive Meredith Grey (played by the indignantly hideous Ellen Pompeo).

The ensemble cast has become a rather must for a show to succeed, this cast is perfect, no weakness at all. The standouts are Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross.

""Desperate Housewives"" lost a little bit of it's momentum in this season, but it's nevertheless just as strong as the previous season. The cliffhanger for this season was a lot better than last year's predictable suicide mystery.

In the first season she was ""only"" the perfect housewife and she dealt with her problem in her way. Because of all the bad events she's going trough in season two she seems more ""humain"", she also has a weak and sensitive side and she is struggling with her life.

Bree: just lost husband Rex while trying to deal with gay son Andrew, guy chasing daughter Danielle, obsessive paramore George as well as hiding her alcoholism.

Susan: has her hands full with daughter Julie and her on again off again relationship with Mike. Added to that the marriage to her ex so she can have an operation while he is dating Edie.

Lynet: goes back to work and faces many crisis while trying to prove that she can be a career woman and mom at the same time.

82492,4,0788861956,"Hey Hey Hey!!!  It's me, I'm back with another review!  How's everyone doing?

I'll review this in sections, as I'm watching the discs on my Rental service.  Right now I'm on disc one, which I completed over the long labor day weekend.

I don't understand what the critics were talking about this season?  Yes, the freshman season excitement has dropped a bit, but I'm still enthralled by this one. I recommend renting the discs, instead of watching live on the television program.  Why?  Well, you can repeat funny silly things.  My favorite thing to watch over and over again, was when the Eva Longoria character was walking to see her husband, between metal fences separating the inmates, and seeing some dorky white guy prisoners start sashaying and dancing, shaking their hips, to get her attention.  NOW THAT WAS HILARIOUS!!!

Another scene shows Eva and her actor husband, in a group session, and some big bald guy gives them a ""shocked"" look.  Just hysterically funny!  I loved it!

The story-lines are a bit far-fetched, yes, but they were last season too.

Currently just finished disc 2.  Was sad to see George go (with so little fanfare).  He was fun, and added drama, so why didn't somebody chop off his head?  I agree with other reviewers that Alfre Woodard's talent is being wasted in this season.  She plays such a small role?  You think she'd be one of the main characters by now, but she still feels like an after thought.

EDIT: Half-way through disc 3: Again, I'm confused by all the critical reviews.  Yes, The dude down at the bottom of the basement is sort of a wasted story-line.  But it is still exciting, and fun to watch.  Wondering what will happen to the Applewhites.  I also love what happened to that private detective that came into the house.  That was AWESOME!!!  I love when bad things happen to crummy people!

I also enjoyed the tension between the religious sister, and the Eva Longoria character.  Gawd, I love sexy cat fights!  And in a church!  That was so awesome!!!

I have around 3 episodes left on disc 3 to watch, but didn't want to miss the opportunity to comment that last night, September 24th, 2006, season 3 began.  I actually watched it last night, but I, as usual hate the commercials, and am impatient to get to the next episode.  I may stop watching, and wait for the DVD set, in about 1 year.  But, I'll probably end up watching the entire season this year.

EDIT:  I have just completed Disc 4.  Well, I am finally getting to shows I already saw. I started watching this half way through season 2, on television.  I saw about 3 episodes on this disc I had already seen.  What strikes me is I can't remember the ""cliff hanger"" from television.  So, I am actually looking forward to disc 5 and 6 to see if I have seen the shows yet.  I'm not sure.

I am intrigued by the Applewhite story. I was shocked to see the interaction between the younger Applewhite son and Bree's daughter at the end of this disc.  I'm curious to see what direction this story will take.

Bree has gained some respect from me too, facing her alcoholism problem.  I loathe her son.  What an arrogant little twerp!

I also like the Eva Longoria story-line.  She is so cute getting attached to Lilly.  What a little minx!

82493,5,0788861956,"This is the greatest television show of it's time! I just got this yesterday, and I have already finished one disk and almost half of the following. I have seen the entire series on TV, so I will give you a bird's eye view of this season along with the characters.

Gabrielle: The season starts out with Gabi being pregnant and Carlos in jail. Carlos does get out of jail, and he starts going to church more often. Gabi has also told John that their relationship is over ever since he spilled the beans to Carlos it was he who was sleeping with his wife.  I will not give anymore storyline away about Gabi, but believe me, it gets even more juicy!

Susan: Well, after the cliff hanging ending of season one, we find out that no one gets hurt by Zach! Susan gets the gun away from him, and she accidently shoots a bullet out the window. Zach runs off. Susan wants to press charges; however, Mike refuses saying that Zach has had a hard life (I was going to say something else, but I can't remember if it comes out in season one or not, and I don't want to ruin anything). Mike wants Zach to be safe, so he tries his best to find him. Susan helps, and she does catch up with him. She gives him money to go to Utah, so he can try to find Paul there, considering this is where Paul used to live. Will this effect Mike and Susan's relation, stay tuned to find out!

Edie: Well, she goes after another man in Susan's life: Carl. Yes, Edie starts dating Carl, which you know is going to really make Susan mad. There isn't much I can say about this without me revealing everything, but I will say one thing: Edie will show Susan that payback is a bitch!

Lynette: Well, Lynette is forced to go back to work! She works for a mean woman named Nina, who constantly tells Lynette that she is not getting time off for her kids because she (Nina) chose not to have kids so she could put her job first. Well, this is hard for Lynette, especially with Parker. The other kids aren't in this season as much Parker. Little Parker makes up Mrs. Mulberry (I know it isn't spelled right) and he starts asking about the opposite sex. Anyways, things will start to get really juicy with Tom and Lynette as well!

The Applewhites: I will not say anything about this family, it will ruin the entire season.

Bree: Bree Van De Kamp is my personal favorite housewife, so I decided to leave her for last! Well, she has to deal with being a single mother and dealing with her mother-in-law during the first few episodes of the season. Rex's body has been dug up due to evidence that suggests that someone may have been poisoning him. After the note is found that says ""Bree, I know what you did and I forgive you"" the finger is pointed directly at Bree. She does take a lie detector test, and it comes up negative, but positive when she is asked if she is in love with George Williams! Bree will also be dealing with George, Danielle's relationship with her new boyfriend, and Andrew with his boyfriend.",1157328000,3,2973,4.3076923076923075

82496,4,0788861956,"* There may be some mild spoilers in this review.

The sophomore season of ""Desperate Housewives"" wasn't always a thrill a minute, at least not initially.  All that business with Bree mourning Rex's death was a bit of a downer.  Then you have the Applewhite scenario, which was intriguing at first but before long became quite a drag.  And all throughout this season they were still harping on the whole Mike-and-his-son / Kendra's murder thing, which, I don't know about you, but it has lost my attention.  This is still a great TV show though, and all the episodes have had their moments.  Eva Longoria was given a terrific chance to shine this season dealing with Gabrielle's pregnancy and rose to the occasion.  Bree, once they finally dumped her old storylines, turns to alcohol in what I found the most engaging plotline this season.  As for Susan and Mike and their on-again, off-again little cat and mouse game: enough already.  But once that was over, Susan got back to her fun and quirky self as she jumped back into the dating pool.  Lynette re-entering the working world presented some interesting dilemmas but they're going to have to find a new way to keep her and her husband's stories fresh.  They did finally deliver (I believe) a terrific payoff for Andrew's promise last season to ""rock [his mother's] world!""  And another (although I think kind of lame) payoff for Tom's little secret he mentioned last season.  By the end of, this season leaves you with plenty exciting cliffhangers.  All in all, maybe it was not as thrilling as season one but I'll still be a loyal viewer.  Note for next season: MORE EDIE, PLEASE!  I mean maybe not so much that she loses her mystique, but this season there were just too many episodes without her at all.  Tsk-tsk!

About the DVD:  The menus appear to be identical to those of the season 1 set.  They could have put a little more thought into that.  There are no full commentaries, but creator Mark Cherry did choose his favorite scenes of the whole season to discuss, a feature which is on the special features disc, #6.  There are also a lot of other interesting featurettes.  I'm certainly primed for season three.",1156982400,,2175,4.680738786279683

82498,3,0788861956,"Desperate Housewives Season Two (2005-2006)

Starring: Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, Nicollette Sheridan, and Alfre Woodard.

When Desperate Housewives premiered in October of 2004, many people weren't sure what to think about it. Some thought it was a boring sitcom, some thought it was unoriginal, but most people (myself included) thought it was pure genius. When I had first heard of ""Desperate Housewives"", I assumed it was a reality show. I hadn't seen any previews or posters, so with the title  ""Desperate Housewives"", it was going to be something like  Nanny-911 . Fortunately, I was wrong, and it turned out to be good quality, SCRIPTED television. After the first season finished, I thought there was no way possible that this show could be ruined. So I, along with the other 25,000,000+ fans in the USA tuned in to the Season Two premiere on September 25th. Not only was I disappointed, but I was completely shocked. The writers hadn't changed, but I kept on thinking, 'what happened over the summer?'. I thought it was just a fluke, but after eight terrible episodes, I thought the series was done for. After the 9th episode, things started to pick up. They weren't as good as before, but still it was something to watch. In my opinion, it was still better than about 80% of what else is on TV.

Plot and Storylines:

The Mystery:

We are introduced to two more neighbors, Matthew and Betty Applewhite in the finale of Season One. According to Cherry,  Betty looks sweet on the outside, but is on the run from the law and has a 'gothic' secret. It really intrigued me, I know what the word gothic means, but it seemed like she had something really interesting to bring to the table. In the first episode, we are briefly shown that the Applewhite's are holding someone in their basement. I thought this was a really odd, but yet captivating plot line, so I watched anxiously how it unfolded. Over the course of the season, we learn by episode 205 that the prisoner is Betty's son, Caleb. We learn that Betty is holding him captive because he murdered a girl in Chicago, which didn't really seem that big in the metaverse of Desperate Housewives, but I thought it was just a coverup to something else that was even worse, like perhaps he was a serial killer. Over the next few episodes, Caleb breaks out of his dungeon and makes it free, only to be captured by the police where they place him in a psychiatric hospital. Betty breaks him out, and all seems to be at peace until a bounty hunter breaks into their house to find him, and incidentally kills himself in the process. Betty tries to hide his body, only to be discovered by local klutz, Susan Mayer, leading the four housewives, plus Edie to become suspicious of their new neighbors. After Bree ascertains the truth, Betty and her come to terms when she blackmails her about her own secrets, and the two develop a shaky relationship. After two no-shows, the Applewhite's return, and Matthew uses Danielle as an opportunity to get rid of Caleb, forcing his mother to believe he's more dangerous than his innocent demenor lets on. But when Betty realizes that Matthew was scheming to get rid of his brother, she makes it her personal duty to punish him by giving him the same penalty his brother receive- a lockdown in their cellar. After Danielle breaks him out, the two run away, and after waiting until things cool down, they return to gather some belongings and start a new life. Danielle discovers Matthew's true colors before it's almost too late, duing her mother Bree's last ditch effort to save her daughter. The last scene Betty and Matthew share was very touching. She reveals to us how she was unable to provide Matthew with as much attention he needed because his brother needed it more. I found this story to be well written, but I didn't think it was handled very well. They spent episodes without even making an appearance, and the worst part of it was they didn't even really tie all the loose ends. We still don't know what happened to Betty's husband, why they were originally going to move from Chicago for, and the background of the Foster family. I originally thought that Tom's ex, Annabel Foster, was related to the mystery because their both from Chicago and have the same last names, but they hardly went into the Foster family, and all we saw was about 7 minutes of Melanie, and that was in the finale.

The Housewives:

Bree's storylines focus on her family. After meeting Rex's mother (Guest star Shirley Knight), they spend, I mean waste, 3 episodes bickering, until finally Bree decided to ship her off. With Rex dead, George Williams (played by the hilarious Roger Bart) thinks of this as his chance to incorporate himself in the family. After a few episodes, Bree finds out his true colors, and after bribing her to save his life by offering herself to him, Bree declines. With George dead, Bree develops alcoholism, and her scheming son Andrew (played by the talented Shawn Pyfrom) wage war on each other, and ultimately, Andrew ends up finding many ways to hurt her, only driving her to completely give up on him.

Susan doesn't really have much of a storyline. After her self-indulgent ex-husband Karl Mayer (played by the charismatic Richard Burgi) moves in, she goes through an on and off phase with him, forming a love triangle with Edie. Later on, she has to go into surgery, and surrenders herself to Karl's risky agreement, causing Edie to resent Susan. She and Mike have a few scenes together, but not as much as I'd like to see (I like Mike + Susan). Overtime, the most pivotal thing she's done is introduce Orson Hodge, the future nemesis of Mike, and one of the main charactors in Season Three's mystery. In the end, her rivalry with Edie cause her to burn down her house, and when Susan accidently sends her to the hospital, Edie vows revenge when she gets out.

Lynette faired the worst of all the housewives. Her storylines were not only tired and predictable, but they were way over the top and unrealistic. She goes back to work, and for the first 9 episodes has the boss from hell, Nina Fletcher (guest starring the jocular Joely Fisher). When Lynette blackmails Nina, she get's an unexpected offer, her boss Ed hires her as Senior VP. After a few more weeks, her husband Tom decides he wants to go back to work, and later on Lynette figures out Tom has a secret, he's been hiding a child from her.

Gabrielle's storylines were plain. After trying, and eventually succeeding to get her husband out of jail, she faces another crisis in her relationship with Carlos when a nun (guest star Melinda Paige Hamilton) drives a stake in their relationship. After she leaves (the only good part of Gabrielle's arc), she decides she wants to be a mother, which leads her to search for a way to get a baby. In the end, she uses her poor maid, Xiao Mei (guest star Gwendoline Yeo) into being a segregate.

The best and worst episodes:

Best (This will be a short list):

(211) One More Kiss: This episode finally incorporates the Applewhite's with the rest of the housewives. It brought back the humour, and had a nice finish.

(213) There's Something About A War: This episode is the end of Gabrielle and Sister Mary's feud. This episode was well written, and brought more to the Applewhite situation.

(219) Don't Look At Me: Bree's evil stepmonster, Eleanor Mason (guest star the amazing Carol Burnett) makes an appearance, and Andrew decides to test Bree's patience.

Worst (This would be really long, but I'll try to make it short):

(201) Next: The premiere was awful. Slapstick humour, and cheap dialogue make this now anywhere near 'juicy' enough for a 3 month wait.

(202) You Could Drive A Person Crazy: Nothing important happened. The scripts get even worse, and for the next eight episodes (minus 207) make it seem like this is an entirely different series than what you saw in the first season.

(204) My Heart Belongs To Daddy: Out of character, and what used to be entertaining is now old.

(208) The Sun Won't Set: Mainly boring and cheesy. Mrs. McClusky with a tazer? Please!

(218) Everybody Say's Don't: Worst episode of the season. It was poorly written, and there was hardly anything about it I liked. They just had to throw in a sex addiction storyline, didn't they?

(220) It Wasn't Meant To Happen: It's hard to believe that Marc Cherry himself wrote this episode. It was really not his best.

Overall, the season wasn't that great. With all of the schedule problems, and some cast members being injured, we ended up waiting even longer for an episode (over 6 weeks at one time). It did have some redeeming qualities, but not enough to make the season work as well as the first one. The main reason why it didn't succeed as a story was because there was way too much going on at one time. They had a total of over 20 regular members, and over 8 storylines happening at once. It ended satisfactory; the season finale premiered a few days ago, but as I said before, they left out too much for it to tie all the loose ends. Another fault would have to be that the writers weren't that creative this time around. They really needed to incorporate all of the main characters, it barely even seemed like they were even friends. What they had originally was a winning formula, a great mystery (despite what most males will say), great comedy, outstanding acting, and suspenseful drama. I couldn't think of any other way to describe it as Sex and the City has a love child with  Twin Peaks , and was raised by  American Beauty, the film. As a final thought, it was a shaky second year, but I think that the third one will be the best. I know a little of what's going to happen, and so far, it really seems like something that will recapture what made Season One so amazing. Season Three seems promising, but we can only wait and see.",1153612800,15,9886,4.6337142857142855
82499,3,0788861956,"The first season of ""Desperate Housewives"" wowwed me out the gate. Each episode added layers of intrigue to the already slam-bang opening mystery. Each episode also included plenty of laugh-out-loud humor as they took viewers in the opposite direction one would expect. It was exciting television, a fresh show that revived ABC (along with ""Lost"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"") from near death. The cool thing is, they wrapped up the central mystery of Season 1 by the final episode (avoiding the scheme of ""Twin Peaks"" to drag out the mystery for as long as they could), while adding some new developments to keep us tuned for Season 2...namely the mysterious Alfre Woodard, who moves into the neighborhood in the middle of the night.

After watching this season, I must say that it got lame in a hurry. The laughs weren't as plentiful, the storyline with Alfre Woodard and the son she keeps locked in the basement was pretty boring, and Teri Hatcher's neurotic housewife was wearing thin. For me, Felicity Huffman's travails at returning to the office and eventually her husband ending up as her co-worker was the reason to watch. She's easily my favorite of the ""Desperate Housewives"". And I was heartbroken along with her when she follows her husband to find out why he's been spending so much time in Atlantic City. Then we find out the whole story in the following episode. That was brilliantly done! Totally fooled me. Season 3 looks even more promising as their storyline continues to new depths. I also enjoyed Eva Longoria as she adjusts to her husband's return from prison. I like some of their one-upman-ship games that they played with one another, but overall, I think I like Eva best when she's fooling around with her garden-boy lover.

I gave season 1 five stars which it well deserved. The reason why I'm not so generous with season 2 is because I believe that the writers got bored with the show. It's not as fresh as it was. I hope this isn't a sign of the short shelf life of the show. There are plenty of outrageous stuff they can add to it. The worst thing they did this season was the lame plot/story/mystery surrounding Alfre Woodard's character. By season's end when it was solved for viewers, it was so bland, boring, and unclimatic that it nearly kills the show for me. Even the cliffhanger with a shooting was uninspired. Come on, writers...show some more creativity and brilliance like season 1! Even if you have to steal stories from headlines, there are strange things emanating from suburbia that you won't be at a loss for ideas. If season 3 doesn't return to the fresh fun of season 1, I'll probably give up on this show altogether. When a show crests, it's hard to get back the magic. This one is dangerously close.",1152576000,6,2742,4.710416666666666
82500,5,0788861956,"Season one provides such entertainment that it has me worried that season two may not be able to fill in the shoes. But no way, season two captivates with its boldness in creative story telling while allowing the ladies to inject even more emotional depth in their characters.

In the first season, I am first drawn to the attractive Gabrielle, then the supermom Lynette and then the brave but vulnerable Bree. Susan gives the most consistent performancce. In this season, it is ingenious to let Lynette get back to work for it is in the working mom that reveals Lynette's strength - her brilliance of mind and flexibility in the office jungle. Gabrielle is more human now and it's high time she was threatened by a younger woman with a more loving heart (at least in appearance). Bree in her revenge for her husband is most gratifying.

I also agree that the addition of the new family is not particularly necessary. It also begs disbelief that not once did Bree regret calling in the ambulance late which might lead to her husband's death. Fortunately it does not tamper the ryhthm of the series. One bonus point - the housewives all look younger and more refreshed; their acting more polished than they were in the first season.  And their husbands, Susan's ex and Lynette's, are given bigger parts to play. The storyline is still going strong and in bright prospect!",1151193600,5,1370,4.7238493723849375

Looking back at Season 2, by time the finale had ended, we all knew much more about our favorite Housewife's personality. For example, who knew Gabrielle had such a soft inside? Eva Longoria and Marcia Cross shone as their characters developed more and I fell even deeper in love with Bree, a psychological complex of love, disappointment, perfectionism, and unresolved childhood issues. The actresses' skills were all pushed to the limit and I admire their ability to surpass my my expectations always.

On the other hand the storylines were a bit silly at times, mostly due to a weak season mystery: Susan's attempted marriage to the gay guy, and how Xiao-Mei was a hidden slave, not to mention the Applewhite hiatus that we experienced towards the end of the show, the Applewhites are the season mystery for heaven's sakes! The Applewhites were also a little too isolated from the neighborhood, I mean we know that Betty is secretive but she doesn't communicate with Gabrielle or Lynette throughout the season! Season 1 was practically bullet-proof, so let's see that come back.

Complaints aside, I did enjoy Season 2, it's the one that got me hooked in the first place, I watched Season 1 on DVD after watching the Season 2 premiere. Don't be put off by the storyline goofs, I omitted the enjoyable parts of Season 2, which outweigh the goofs, so as not to spoil it for you.

The finale seems very promising, so I hope Season 3 continues the great work but factors in a more riveting mystery. Buy this set, and enjoy the top-notch acting (better than Season 1), the amazing Brenda Strong's narration, top-notch production, and in many cases, issues that hit home.",1150156800,8,1784,4.785714285714286
