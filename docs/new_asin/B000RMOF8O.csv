8201431,5,B000RMOF8O,Just watch it... It will make you realize that things are a lot more disturbing than you realize when it comes to abuse of power and potential for massive abuse in the future. Good thing most of the Police are still on our side for now. You never know about the future though. This is becoming a real world Penopticon.,1513555200,,318,4.316666666666666

8201434,5,B000RMOF8O,"This documentary outlines the pure evil that has taken over the government of the former united states. The outright and subversive tactics that have been used by elite poewers towards the instaltion of the world govenment is shocking. There is no other explanation for the reason why a politial elite would do the things that have been done throughout the 2oth century to the citizens of planet earth, other than they are being driven by an evil beyond our physical world. It does not matter if they are republican or demoncrat,  Hillery, Bush, Cheney, Obama, Bloomberg, McCain, ect, they are of the came spawn, hell bent to use false flag terrorism and the threat of terroism to enslave and controll the population of earth. Good movie though, you will enjoy seeing who is realy behind the destruction of the world. Dont forget you popcorn and a snuggly blanket now.",1406764800,,868,4.825503355704698

8201436,5,B000RMOF8O,"Alex Jones Martial Law 9-11: Rise of the Police State is the best documentary film ever made
by Alex Jones. The film is very powerful and I would recommend this film to anyone wanting
to be educated.",1380931200,,199,4.405405405405405
8201437,4,B000RMOF8O,"Alex Jones is probably the foremost shotgun documentarian in the world today: he throws everything at you, all at once.  This makes for an interesting watch - but also a frustrating watch.  Because, at the end of the day, even a conspiracy buff needs to be able to distinguish what's important, even fearful, from what's merely trivial.  Now he may well be suggesting that all these things are intricately inter-related; and that you need to be aware of all of them to make sense of any of them.  But he doesn't really say so; it's only their proximity in his documentaries that infers a connection.  So while it's certainly interesting to learn all about the so-called ""Secret Societies"" that supposedly control those who run real societies as if they were merely pawns in some great international conspiracy aimed at bringing about a one-world government, it's doubtful if these Societies have anywhere near as great an impact on the day to day business of running the nations of the world as Mr Jones would suggest.  And, unless you happen to believe the biblical Armageddon myth, the idea of a one-world government may not be as bad as Mr Jones clearly thinks it would.  The world might even be a better place without the dozens of nation-states all competing with one another for supremacy.

Another thing you quickly discern from any Alex Jones documentary is his obsession with some sinister, all-powerful entity which threatens to turn the entire world into a slave state - or, as he might put it, a ""Prison Planet.""  In his ""Endgame"" it was the Bilderberg Group; in his ""Martial Law: Rise of the Police State"" it is the Illuminati - specifically as manifested through something called Bohemian Grove.  This Bohemian Grove, however, is not an organization so much as it is a place around which an all-men's club bearing its name sprung up - a physical location in California where an annual event takes place by invitation only.  This club was founded, not by the world's elite, but by artists and musicians, mostly from San Francisco.  If you read about it in Wikipedia, it sounds more like a Boy Scout camp than a gathering of those intent on taking over the world.  Since his primary focus in this documentary is the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York, a link between this men's club and the policing of New York streets is inferred - never stated, only inferred.  So while it does look as if New York had indeed become a Police State during the Convention, just as Jones indicates, it pales in comparison to the streets of Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

This brings up a third characteristic of any Alex Jones documentary.  While there's a dizzying array of evidence presented, none of it, individually or all together, leads to the conclusions he draws.  He never quite manages to piece it all together in a way to lead inescapably to his conclusion; it requires a leap of faith of get from the body of his documentary to its conclusion.  And along the way to that conclusion, he throws out interesting tid-bits of conjecture without the slightest evidence to back it up.  He says, for instance, that Communism was concocted and set into motion by international bankers in order to send the world's workers on a wild goose chase; and that Arnold Schwarzenegger, besides being implicated in the Bohemian Grove conspiracy, has his sights on ruling the world - which makes him the darling of the Illuminati; and that because filmmaker Michael Moore failed to ask the tough questions about ""911,"" he is a dupe of the establishment.  And, finally, he indulges in the most reckless type of conclusion any documentarian can draw: guilt by association.  He rattles off a list of the politicians who have visited Bohemian Grove, as if this somehow proves that they're lackeys for the Illuminati; but all it implies is that people in positions of power attend almost any kind of function if it can further their careers.

If Alex Jones were not so spot-on with so many of his ideas - such as the on-going threat to our Constitution from the virtual corporate take-over of our government, or the likelihood that ""911"" was an inside job, or the very real danger from an unregulated banking system, or the foolishness of a manufactured ""left/right"" paradigm  - you could simply dismiss him as a ""crack-pot.""  But, as it is, he has a great deal to say that people would do well to listen to - which makes his more esoteric ideas so maddening.  Best advice to him: lose the Illuminati, the Bilderbergs and all the other Secret Societies out to take over the world - and, most of all, lose the unsubstantiated conclusions; and concentrate on what he does best - reporting.  Because, when all is said and done, Alex Jones is one of the best reporters in America today.  He always manages to get the story; he just doesn't always get it right.",1278115200,,4877,4.754448398576512
8201438,4,B000RMOF8O,This video is not bad.  Of course what Alex Jones video couldn't go w/o him spinning off into one of his rants.  He does it a few times in this one.  Most of the info he gives is right on target.  Other stuff (if you excercise discernment) he just flat out pulls out of his butt.  Overall still pretty accurate video & has actual footage w/ no drive by media filtering to cover anything up.  A pretty good video.  A good watch.,1244505600,4,427,4.134146341463414
8201439,5,B000RMOF8O,"This was the first Alex Jones documentary I watched, and I haven't been the same since.

The documentary starts off with excellent coverage of the 2004 Republican National Convention protests. In various scenes, Jones is threatened with arrest for simply filming, even though he has a press pass. He also interviews several protestors. Some are well-informed, but some are still clearly stuck in the false left/right paradigm, especially when Jones confronts a couple communist groups, with one of their members accusing Jones of being a Nazi and a capitalist, even when Jones shows that communism was created by the central bankers to ""con the serfs back into serfdom."" In fact, one communist even says it's too bad Stalin didn't kill Jones.

The film moves on to an expose of filmmaker Michael Moore. In this part, Jones shows that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is actually a whitewash of what really happened on 9/11, showing that Moore was more interested in showing footage of Bush playing golf and being an ""idiot elf"" than asking the really hardcore 9/11 questions. In fact, Jones confronts Moore and asks him why he didn't talk about NORAD standing down on 9/11, and Moore's reply was ""that would be un-American,"" clearly showing that Moore is just a puppet used to keep people in the false left/right paradigm.

Next, Jones does a great expose of what happened to WTC Building 7, even showing PBS footage of WTC complex owner Larry Silverstein who admitted that the building was destroyed by controlled demolition. Jones also exposes Silverstein's motives on 9/11, which was mainly a $7 billion insurance settlement.

Jones later covers the RNC, showing a montage of neocon elites using ""terrorism"" and ""terrorists"" as their main talking points. From this, the movie moves on to expose the ruling elite and their ties to the occult. This perfectly segues into the film's defining moment: Jones' confrontation of former presidential advisor David Gergen on his involvement in one-world government implementers (Council on Foreign Relaitons, Trilateral Commission, and Bilderberg Group) as well as Gergen's involvement in the Bohemian Grove.

The film wraps up with an expose of the criminal elite's police-state Big Brother surveillance agendas including transponders in cars (for taxing purposes), national ID cards, and even implantable microchips. From this, Jones exposes what the United Nations was clearly set up for, and finally, the film ends with a midnight boat ride.

At close to three hours in length, you may think it's too long, but there is a lot of information in this film. Picture-wise, the film looks outstanding. Audio-wise, the audio is crystal-clear, but the music soundtrack isn't as outstanding as Jones' latest films (Terrorstorm and Endgame) which have original music by Graham Reynolds, music director of the critically-acclaimed ""A Scanner Darkly"". Some of the 9/11 information in this film has become a bit outdated, but still, I whole-heartedly recommend this film.",1191283200,37,2991,5.233820459290188
