2189296,5,B0006IUDB2,"For anyone who grew up in the 1970's or 1980's, and for anyone who is interested in the power of the human spirit to ""do something,"" this is truly a special two-DVD set.

It is chock-full of behind-the-scenes footage of how this amazing event came together and the impact it had on galvanizing the support of thousands of people toward a common cause.

Among the many highlights are some incredibly emotional scenes from the recording sessions.  My personal favorites were of Bruce Springsteen and Ray Charles, two music industry giants who brought their own unmatched passion to the recording.

The DVDs do a nice job of documenting not only the recording session but also the cause itself -- eradicating hunger and starvation in Africa and at home in the U.S.

Perhaps the most inspiring takeaway of the collection is the fact that two individual people -- Harry Belafonte and Ken Kragen -- saw the tragedy that millions of other people were simultaneously witnessing -- but chose to do something about it.

Their individual efforts began a chain reaction and a movement who's impact is still felt today, some 20 years later.

You will enjoy this DVD set many times over.  Get extra sets for friends and family members and you'll touch their souls too.",1107820800,29,1254,4.827102803738318

2189298,5,B0006IUDB2,"I organized ""We Are The World"" 20 years ago and oversaw the production of this 4-hour 2-DVD set. It contains footage never available on DVD before and most of it has never been released for public sale anywhere. It is the definitive story of the making of the historic recording with in depth looks at the work of Bruce Springstein, Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan and others as they sing that night in 1985. It also includes both the 1985 HBO special hosted by Jane Fonda and the 1995 retrospective special on Disney that is narrated by Harry Belefonte. Included on the second DVD are tributes done on The American Music Awards and The Grammys as well as the WATW LiveAid finale. It's a great piece of history to own and the proceeds will go for tusnami relief in East Africa, for AIDS work in Africa and for poverty issues here at home.

2189299,5,B0006IUDB2,"I heard this DVD was to be released at its 20th Anniversary Special Edition on local radio on 104.3 FM in LA.  They played the song on Friday, Jan. 29, 2005 before its re-release for a DVD.  I went right away and found at the local Best Buy store for a great price.

I loved this song and I remembered that I was 14 at the time of its release on cassette and LP records.  It was for a great cause and United for song of hope. The great popstars came out to raise their voices to help Africa's hungry.  I was looking for a CD re-release of the song.  They should re-release as a CD single. So far you can buy the title song online for resonable price as a MP3 file like Itunes.

I have watch the documentary on DVD and it tells who wrote the songs, who the stars that participated in it, and who sang all the parts of the song with solos and the entire group.

The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson.

The 2 disc DVD set comes with collectible insert booklet, which contains the history of how the night of Jan 28, 1985 how the song was made with all the stars.  The booklet also contains the lyrics of the song and picture of the group and where the stars stood in the group (like Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Cydie Lauper, Diana Ross, Diane Warwick, Kenny Rogers, Bruce Springstein, Michael Jackson, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Janet Jackson, etc up to 45 stars)  for the memorable song.

1st Disc includes the documentary by Jane Fonda and the Music Video of the We Are The World Song conducted by Quincy Jones.

2nd Disc contains the extras,history and documentary, and places where the song ws played like 10th anniversary ""one song, many hands"", American Music Awards, 28th Grammy awards, ""Live Aid"" footage from ABC, etc. and Karaoke track of the song too.

It well worth the price this song that makes history and make for a good cause, USA For Africa organization still is around to help out for hunger and AIDS 20 years later.  The proceeds of this DVD  goes to the USA For Africa organization. Great!  If you like  Great Music and Great Stars come for a good cause, it's a great piece of history with this song ""WE Are the World"" and how it all began.  This DVD is for you and for your children to remember.

The Stars should make a DVD or CD of a new song for the Tsunami victims in Asia with today's pop artists with yesterday's pop and rock artists too.",1107043200,147,2397,4.308035714285714

I have a vhs that I either copied from some one or maybe I recorded it from TV, so long ago that I cannot remember the particular.  ITs not the clearest, but I cherish it because its all I have to remember from the event.  NOW I GET TO PURCHASE AND OWN THIS ""We are the World"".  I'm speechless.  The copy I have is the story behind the song, and now I get more.  So I cannot wait to get it.  It better be all I think it is.  When I get it I'll let you know.

The singers in the recording...are filmed...(including for example, RAY CHARLES who is no longer with us).  So many wonderful pop singers of the day...BOB DYLAN is among them.  And MICHAEL JACKSON ...who wrote the song (mostly) with Lionel Richie.is shown doing the lead track for the other singers.  I found it to be a very engrossing film.  HARRY BELAFONTE is one of the group...and the others honor him by singing DEY-O....a very spontaneous moment.  This song raised $55 million for Ethiopia...the famine that was ongoing in that beleaguered country.  Two Ethiopian women were brought into the session and spoke to the group.  STEVIE WONDER, DIANA ROSS, BRUCE SPRINGSTEIN, JACKIE, MARLON, RANDY, and LATOYA JACKSON....are all there.  QUINCY JONES conducted....This song won a Grammy...and was played siumultaneously on radio stations across the world...on a certain date and time.

It is just so great to see all these wonderful artists bringing Michael and Lionel's song, and Harry Belefonte and Ken Kragen's dream to life.  The sheer joy that they all felt during that recording session is infectious.  It was a real all-night party and well done all of them for being willing to do this wonderful thing for others much much less fortunate than most of us.  Many funny and poignant moments in the making which are great to see and feel part of when one listens to the song and watches the dvd.  The bonus tracks of all solos are just fantastic.

The 2nd disc is harder to watch as Harry and Ken go to Ethiopia to see for themselves where the money was being spent, and how they could spend it better.  Deeply deeply moving, and really just a reminder that this kind of thing is still going on in Africa and other countries, and that we are indeed the world, and constantly need to be reminded to do something as they all did.",1369094400,2,1065,4.242574257425742

As soon as I started watching it, I couldn't take my eyes off it...It was really amazing to see all the well known celebs get together, to help all those people in Africa & to raise money, since that was the whole point of the song at the time...
I especially loved the parts with Michael, because I gotta be honest, he looked oh so stunningly gorgeous during that era! I just couldn't get enough of it, especially with the clips of him rehearsing all by himself! My face turned BEET RED! It was definetly a cute sight to see 
And I am NOT joking about that one bit :)

I will also have to say that some of the clips I've seen before, since I also own another MJ DVD that has the same footage from the American Music Awards & Grammy Awards of '86 as well, which is the ""Michael Jackson: The Awards Collection"" DVD! Even if you don't have that, I seriously consider all you MJ fans to get it as well, to add to your collection, considering some of the quality for some of the footage is not exactly the best. But hey...still good as always!
I give this DVD a 5 star, since it's truly one of the best MJ DVDs out there & you'll love it since it's basically hours of entertainment!
I've truly enjoyed it & I sincerely hope that any MJ fan & their families will enjoy this for years to come :)",1356998400,2,1494,4.1482758620689655

2189380,4,B0006IUDB2,"Harry Belafonte came up with the idea to raise funds to help Africans. Following, Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie came up with the song. And then, music legends generously donated their talents to an urgent cry for help. The rest is history.

The first DVD contains the documentary We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song. It's a really in depth look at the recording process. After going on a star trip meeting other stars, the singers get down to the gruelling process of recording.

It was really tedious for them to sing their parts over and over, but the reality is hard work. Some got visibly tired as they came straight from the awards show and worked from night till morning.

Of course, you get the music video here. Quality is very good, just like they released it yesterday. There are plenty of extras like individual artists recording their parts. Believe me, there are A LOT for your viewing pleasure, though some are repeated from the main feature.

DVD 2 details the journey to Africa and the geographical, logistical and other difficulties faced in bringing aid to people. A very eye opening documentary.

The best parts for me are the Grammy and American Music Awards presentation. The latter had Diana Ross gathering the music artists to sing the song as a group. As the camera travels round the stage, there's a glimpse of a very young Whitney Houston, then a rising star.

Another special feature are three Live Aid recordings by BBC and MTV, the most comprehensive one from ABC. The sound system is pretty volatile, you cannot hear Harry Belafonte sing. Artists who did not sing on the record are here live - Sheena Easton, Patti LaBelle, Melissa Manchester. But someone let out what sounded like a large belch during the performance plus other weird noises. Couldn't Image have edited it out? Oh dear no, it would have compromised the artistic integrity of the company.",1341187200,,1897,4.7682926829268295

There is alot of behind-the-scenes footage of music celebs that were popular at that time, from pop music to country, and legends like Bob Dylan and Ray Charles are also included in the making of this famous song. Plus scenes from Africa, as well, which is why the song was written, to raise money to help people who were starving in Ethiopia. This dvd combo costs less than $10 and it is definitely worth it!

I've caught most of it on You Tube, but just wanted my own copy.  I'm a child of the golden era of rock and roll and this project was performed by so many of my favorite artists.  If you listen to classic rock and readily identify with those artists, you'll love seeing so many of them together in one place working on this recording.  Can you imagine being in a room filled with the likes of Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry, Ray Charles, Springsteen, Dylan, Ray Charles and too many more to name!  Love the ""behind the scenes"" footage and pictures.  Also, was gratifying to know that his humanitarian effort went so smoothlty and quickly.

There were two...one shorter one that had only the end result.  And the long one that showed all the behind the scenes activity.  I especially loved where the group broke into an impromptu version of ""Day-O"".  It's just priceless.  What an event.  So many great singers all there for one reason...to make and record a beautiful song for charity.  It truly is something to see.

I have to admit that I bought this DVD because I want to see Michael Jackson, now I found the story is touching and great. There's a small booklet to give you the brief of the story, and some small stories, here's one very touching:

7:30P.M.:Lionel Richie's house. Lionel has been sleeping since 10:00a.m. The phone rings. It's Steve Perry, calling from his L.A. hotel room. Perry says he just had to call somebody. Lionel asks him what's wrong. Perry says that he slept well. He got up and ordered room service. They brought him breakfast. he sat down. He pulled the silver cover off the food. And then he started crying.

OMG, tears come from my eyes...
Still miss Michael.",1253145600,,750,4.467153284671533
2189402,5,B0006IUDB2,"I bought this because it said it featured never before seen footage with Michael Jackson and I was not dissapointed! I was excited discovering the raw sequences of him there. His solos were the greatest, you could see him recording, laughing with Quincy, singing with no background music, trying hard not to dance.. just precious. I wish they released dozens of Dvd's with just Michael recording stuff in the studio because he is such a delight to watch and his voice is just amazing.

Then you have the whole night of recording of the song, you can see all the artists working together in an extraordinary way. Everybody was so tired, but the enthusiasm was above everything else. On the second dvd you can also see a follow-up of the song, how it aired in tens of countries at the same time, how they went to Africa to get them the food (that part got me very emotional), but also the live performance exactly how it appeared on tv and the Grammy and VMA awards (again, Michael goes onstage gracious and sweet as ever) and the ""Hands Across Amerca"" initiative.

I think everybody should have this, as a reminder of how people can really make That Change if they join together as one. What's been captured on this set of DVDs is clearly a historic moment.

2189405,5,B0006IUDB2,"This DVD covers footage that I wouldn't have dreamed of.  It not only has the video but the recording sessions themselves, including that of Michael Jackson recording the background vocals. It shows the recording of the duets, the recording of the solo parts, and a rehearsal of the chorus.

You see the singers going over the material, and witness the development of the song, from ""raw material"" into the final products.

The footage is rare and ""historical.""

In addition to the recording sessions, it also shows the award shows during which the song received awards, as well as the Live Aid concert.

There are one or two places when the cameraman could have done more exciting of a job...such as when he focuses the camera solely on a particular individual and stays there for long minutes instead of getting shots of different people who are also singing...  But, 3-4 minutes in a documentary of several hours is not something to fret over.

It shows the making of the song.  All of the famous artists from the 80's.  While watching this DVD, I realized that this has got to be one of the greatest songs ever written.  It still gives me goose bumps to hear it, espcially Cyndi Lauper's part at the peak of the song... it's brilliant!  Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie wrote a gem and when you see this video you will agree.  There is also a bonus DVD that shows the story behind USA for Africa and tells about the millions of dollars that were made from this song and how it helped the starving people in Africa.

2189411,5,B0006IUDB2,"The recent death of Michael Jackson brought memories of the collaboration that brought many artists to produce We Are The World, so we decided to purchase the DVD in honor of the King of Pop.

We are the world was created to raise the necessary funds to help Ethiopia, which back in 1985 was suffering the consequences of unusual lack of rain and political decisions that did not advance the needs of its people.

Jane Fonda narrates the reasons behind the production of We are the world and she is simply, her magnificent self as she encourages viewers to engage in the effort to eliminate famine throughout the world.

The video provides an in-depth look into the making of the video and how these powerful stars ""left their egos at the door"" and collaborated to create one of the best pieces ever performed.

Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie wrote this song and thanks to the help of producer Quincy Jones, they were able to attract super talent to contribute their time and voices in the hope of selling enough records to make a difference.

Disc 1 offers the documentary narrated by Jane Fonda ending with the final version of the song as released to the world.

Disc 2 takes us to Africa and we witness the devastation and sickness resulting from famine. Harry Belafonte takes us through the decision making process that ensured that every dollar donated ended benefiting the people of Africa. This video is highly educational and an eye opening experience.

The stars that join for this effort are: Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner, Billy Joel who arrives at the concert in the company of Christie Brinkley, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Al Jarreau, Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry, Daryl Hall, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper, Kim Carnes, Bob Dylan and Ray Charles. Also singing as part of the chorus we were delighted to see Dan Aykroyd, Harry Belafonte, Lindsey Buckingham, The News, Sheila E, Bob Geldof, Jackie, Tito, Randy, LaToya and Marlon Jackson, Waylon Jennings, Bette Midler, John Oates, Jeffrey Osborne, The Pointer Sisters and Smokey Robinson.

As we heard the song created for such a worthy cause we realized that ""there comes a time, when we head a certain call, when the world must come together as one because there are people dying and it is time to lend a hand to life... the greatest gift of all.""

And we are glad that we invested in this effort because ""we can't go on, pretending day by day, that someone, somewhere will soon make a change."" It is up to us because ""we are all part of God's great big family, and the truth is that we have come to understand that love is all we need.""

Don't miss it, it is simply magnificent!",1247702400,3,2744,4.733752620545073

2189414,5,B0006IUDB2,"It was April 5, the observed Good Friday of 1985.  Within an hour's time 8,000 separate radio stations had made at least one broadcast of this song called ""We Are the World,"" a seven-minute song by an organization called USA for Africa.  It was produced by Quincy Jones, written by Michael Jackson & Lionel Richie and featured both their voices, plus those of Tina Turner, Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nelson, Kenny Loggins, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and so many others.  The purpose of the single was to spread public awareness in the western world of famine in third-world African nations, such as Ethiopia.  It's very likely that, if there were any followers of American popular music that hadn't listened to ""We Are the world"" or heard of USA for Africa prior to this date, the chances are good that they knew about both afterwards.  And, this documentary hosted by Jane Fonda would serve to enhance that knowledge upon its release later that year.

I was five years old at the time of We Are the World's popular period.  I was too young to know the meaning of starvation or where Africa was.  I do remember hearing the song very often, both on the radio and the tape player.  After we obtained a copy of this special, the whole family watched it regularly (it became one of those staples that I couldn't get away from).  One reason for this is that, it featured Jane Fonda.  I'd previously only heard her voice in audio form.  This was the first instance where I remember seeing her in front of a camera.  Also, it was excellent to see how Quincy Jones looked and to get a glimpse of people such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Tina Turner and Kenny Rogers in the same studio together.

Twenty years later, I'd become a musician and learned a considerable amount about writing, arranging, recording and performing.  Looking back, I came to understand how significant this documentary was, being my first acquired knowledge of the recording process or what it's like being in a studio.  Also, the song and the way it was recorded harkens back in my mind to the Beatles' original version of ""Hey Jude"" from 1968.  I've never worked in a top-grade studio (all my experiences have been in project studio environments) or in audiovisual, but I do have ultimate respect for all the artists, musicians, engineers, filmmakers and crew that had a hand in the song and the videotaping of the sessions.  I'm in all their debts, as are so many of us whether or not we know it.  Someday, I hope to work in big studios (like A&M or Lion Share) and to work with the likes of Quincy Jones or Humberto Gatica.  I'd never be able to produce another ""We Are the World,"" but I also wouldn't want to.  It's not necessary, anymore than an interest in producing another ""Hey Jude.""",1242604800,,2775,4.622448979591836

2189422,4,B0006IUDB2,"This is a great behind-the-scenes look at one of the biggest musical events of the twentieth century.

The documentary WE ARE THE WORLD: THE STORY BEHIND THE SONG (on dvd #1) is narrated and hosted by Jane Fonda and appears to have been made shortly after the historic recording session, which happened on January 28, 1985. Showing the celebrities arriving, meeting and greeting, and of course the recording of the song ""We Are The World,"" as well as  pre-writing and arrangement stages that took place days before(between Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones), viewers get a fly-on-the-wall experience of what went on that night.

It really is remarkable to see so many artist from different generations and musical styles combining forces for a greater cause. Where else would you see Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Kenny Rogers, The Pointer Sisters, Paul Simon, Tina Turner, and Ray Charles, among many others, singing together on one song? The documentary shows the actual breakdown of the recording of the chorus parts, the solos and the very short rehearsal sessions that took place that one night. The recording was done in three parts: the chorus, the line of solo artists that we see in the video, and additional solos by artists that were included after.  The actual edited music video is also included.

On dvd #2 there is a ten-year anniversary documentary/interview with Harry Belafonte and this is curious to watch. As another reviewer pointed out, during this documentary Belafonte continues to point out how he got the idea and wanted to do something about the famine plaguing Ethiopia etc., but never once does he mention Bob Geldof. For those of you who remember that time, it was Bob Geldof (BOOMTOWN RATS) and Midge Ure(ULTRA-VOX) who started this whole thing with the song ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" that had many British singers/musicians(as well as American artists Jody Watley and Kool & the Gang and Irish band U2) contributing their talents and collaborating on that single. The British/Irish/American supergroup was called ""BAND AID"" and was created to help with relief aid to those starving in Ethiopia. The single ""DO THEY KNOW..."" was released in December 1984 and went to number one almost a month and a half before WE ARE THE WORLD was recorded.

It really has nothing to do with the enjoyment of watching these documentaries or saying which was better BAND AID or USA FOR AFRICA...and really small potatoes in the grand scheme of things...it's just a little troubling to see someone taking credit for a historic event without even mentioning Geldof or Band Aid (who historically were the pre-cursors to ""We Are The World""). The documentary also includes the problems that happened with logistics and controversy of why some of the aid money never reached its destination that surrounded USA FOR AFRICA and talks about HANDS ACROSS AMERICA.

Additional footage is also included on dvd #2 including a live 1986 ""American Music Awards"" performance of WE ARE THE WORLD; Belafonte, Jackson, Richie and Jones accepting various awards for the song; and the ""Live Aid"" concert performance of that song. Also included is a booklet that gives an hour-by-hour play-by-play description of the recording session, which is a reprint of a 1985 LIFE magazine cover story.

Unless you actually remember this moment in time, or perhaps a huge fan of one of the artists who appear on WATW, this might not be enjoyable to watch.",1179100800,18,3447,5.003490401396161
2189423,5,B0006IUDB2,"Seeing this song and the making of it (behind the scenes) reminds me of the good things about my generation, the best things. Admitedly we did spawn the ""me generation"" but once in a while we did rock the establishment, we accelerated the end of the Vietnam conflict, and we did do some good altruistic things.  This song and the USA for Africa cause and artists like Bob Dylan are testimony to that.",1178928000,2,400,4.47945205479452
2189424,5,B0006IUDB2,I got this and watched and it brought back such good memories.  All these famous personalities banding together for a cause.  I love the behind the scenes.  Just a really good thorough DVD and then of course the actual video! AND I loved seeing my Main Squeeze Steve Perry!!!!,1178409600,2,276,4.591836734693878
2189425,5,B0006IUDB2,We all have to come together and help each other no matter what position you are in. This is what it's all about you don't have to be a star. It makes me feel good to help others so let's not forget it's better to give than receive.,1175731200,2,232,3.8541666666666665
2189426,4,B0006IUDB2,"Although this DVD is a little dated in production values, it is a surprisingly pleasant trip down memory lane of the biggest musical event of the 1980's.

Sadly, there is no reference to the event that inspired USA for Africa being Bob Geldorf's Band Aid (you'd swear America invented everything...), and it treats We Are The World as a stand alone triumph. But that is more a comment about the producer's creative judgement rather than the talent in the studio.

However, this DVD takes you into the studio and allows you access to the world's biggest stars trying to record this epic song at 2am after an industry function.

It's awesome to watch Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie writing the original score and Quincy Jones somehow piecing together so many different musical singing styles to blend together into a final mix.  Who else would choose Dionne Warwick and Willie Nelson to sing together!!

It's amazing how big these stars were at the time, and how much today's ""artists"" pale by comparison.  Incredible how great Ray Charles was on the project - and how lost Bob Dylan was in the presence of this talent.  Cyndi Lauper's passionate contribution being interupted by her clanging earrings and Billy Joel's mock irritation at discovering the difficult key the song is written in. Springsteen's intense ad lib recording sessions.

A worthy addition to any 1980's music lovers collection.",1170288000,13,1400,4.978540772532189
2189427,5,B0006IUDB2,"Since time that I awaited it. I am pleased to listen again to this song and to see these artists who give best of themselves.

A good part of fun also in the bonus with Smokey Robinson and Ray Charles, with ""day Ho"" the song composed by Harry Bellafonte. Much sympathy and deep friendship seem to come out from their collaboration.

Even my children and their friends(12 and 16 years old) were ""captured""!

The quality of the sound is good.

I go garrant! Buy it, you will not regret it!",1156377600,4,487,4.377777777777778
2189428,4,B0006IUDB2,"This is a very entertaining DVD.  It gives a lot of inside information, but, please, where are the country stars that could have performed?  Kenny Rogers (probably because he lent his ""Lion's Share"" recording studio to produce it), and Willie Nelson.  That's it.  Willie should have said, ""Hell, no!  I want some of my friends here!""",1149379200,,333,4.875
2189429,3,B0006IUDB2,"A terribly grating production on the surface (there is only so many times you can listen to an eclectic group of 1980s stars sing `We are the world, we are the children' without wanting to smash this disc with a hammer), the additional footage that accompanies the original We Are The World film is incredibly revealing. Documenting a cluster of American hitmakers creating a pop single to help aid the African famine plight (Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones worked up the original demo after seeing the success of Band Aid's similar musical juggernaut), the greatest moments on this two disc set are the outtakes from two of the bigger rock stars involved in the recording of the 1985 hit. Bob Dylan is shown looking incredibly uneasy and unimpressed when an impromptu rendition of the Banana Boat Song breaks out amongst the gathered throng, while his solos show a man desperately unsure of his own ability until Quincy Jones reassures him. On the flipside of the coin Bruce Springsteen is seen on the extra footage giving a powerful first take of his lines, somehow balancing passion with anguish in a way the irksome Al Jarreau couldn't dream of. All up, this isn't as wearing as it could well have been. DVD extras include plenty of additional scenes plus a boring 10th Anniversary Special, performances of the song at the American Music Awards and Live Aid, a karaoke version of the track and plenty more to keep Kenny Loggins, Hall And Oates and Kim Carnes fans happy.",1135036800,8,1490,4.801556420233463
2189430,5,B0006IUDB2,"I agree with Cyndi Lauper's comment in the new Rollingstone magazine--that this song ""sounds like a Pepsi commercial."" Billy Joel also agreed. Both Cyndi and Billy lent their voices to an excellent cause that night along with 45 other stars, that helped to save thousands of starving people in Africa. So even it wasn't the best song ever written, it certainly did a lot of good. Some of the outtakes are a lot of fun. And this was a history making moment that will probably never be repeated again, and one that will be forever remembered as ""check your egos at the door.""",1134777600,4,573,4.572815533980583
2189431,1,B0006IUDB2,"The British did this first with their charity single, ""Do They Know it's Christmas?""

Not that we Americans can't take their idea and use it, but we, of course, have to spray paint Ugly American all over it.

The celebs were in town for the Grammies, if I remember right.  They left the awards and stopped by the studio to dine on champagne and caviar while recording their one or two lines.  Then they rattled on to cameras about what great humanitarians they all are for doing this.

Then they jumped in their limos and partied the rest of the night away.

If you bought the CD or this DVD, then YOU'VE probably contributed more to saving people in Africa than the gazillionaires fawning all over each other here.

(Watch Bob Dylan's scenes carefully: for some reason, he refused to sing in front of anyone and they actually kicked everyone out until he sang his part).

If watching Harry Belafonte fly all the way to Africa to place product placement shirts on starving African kids doesn't say something to you, then you really need to reevaluate which altar to bow down and worship.",1134345600,8,1087,4.595854922279793

can do great by getting the mp3!!

I remember the Video of this,

and I watch it alot because of

the vocals and because of

it's uniqueness- the fact it's for

world relief of hunger makes it more amzing..

If there is a song like this, there should be

a song for every possible problem

in the world-- unrealistic- but it

would be a better place-- a song dedicated

for the relief of AIDS, song dedicated

to Mr Rogers...this song is the first song

I ever heard that had real meaning behind it...",1116633600,6,539,4.116504854368932

It was a singular moment in this generation when the biggest names in the music business came together purely to lend their time and effort to a charitable cause.  Famine relief in Africa.  I grabbed a laser disc copy of this when it first came out in the 80's.  I've viewed it many times since then and it still gives me goose bumps to watch.  I wanted to replace it with a DVD version and will certainly add one to my collection.",1115251200,6,529,4.25

2189438,5,B0006IUDB2,"I must admit, the reason I ordered this 20th Anniversary DVD was to see Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Ray Charles, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross--all in the same room again. They are all amazing talents, that checked their ""egos at the door,"" that night back in 1985. They were there along with a number of other singers, to help a nation of starving people have a chance at life. There are some priceless outtakes of the late Ray Charles, Stevie, Cyndi and Bruce that had me thoroughly entertained. This is definitely worth buying. I believe a portion of the money from Amazon will be going to the Tsunami Relief fund and other worthy charities.",1107993600,31,665,4.741379310344827
