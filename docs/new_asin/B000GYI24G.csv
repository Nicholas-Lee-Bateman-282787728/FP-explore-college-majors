8365483,2,B000GYI24G,I bought this as an educational video.  It is both boring and x-rated (unable to be shown in an educational setting).,1459296000,,117,4.571428571428571
8365484,5,B000GYI24G,"For lovers of New Orleans jazz,this DVD presents an accurate and evocative account of the early days of the music. It also gives an accurate description of Kid Ory's place in its creation. He was there to hear Buddy Bolden and went on to tour Europe with his band in the Fifties.
He played with everyone, Armstrong, Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton, then made a memorable comeback in the Forties. The background music and the filming match the narrative.
A great story and well told.",1353196800,,479,4.647058823529412
