8096957,3,B000CCCZYK,I was on that BOAC plane which was hijacked in 1970! I was a bit disappointed as the whole documentary was a skimmed version of what happened.  Even though this happened more than 30 years ago I still remember details like it happened yesterday!,1396742400,,245,4.568181818181818
8096958,5,B000CCCZYK,"This is a great piece in a very complex puzzle. I've watched it everyday since it arrived. Put it with Munich, PBS Elusive Peace. It's a must see, but put it context with other middle east documentaries. It clears a lot of things, but it also brings up many more questions of why we in the U.S need to know more about this region.",1381104000,,330,4.171875
8096959,4,B000CCCZYK,"As a historical review of what was one of the more dramatic events of the 20th century, this movie is well done.  It presents the evidence fairly, interviews both captives and hijackers, and gives them fair representation.  It is typical of the quality of PBS.
Only negative comment is that it links this hijacking to later terrorist acts, which takes it out of context.",1235260800,,370,4.765625
