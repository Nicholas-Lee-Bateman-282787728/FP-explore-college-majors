6098023,5,B00GPPXNLC,"One of the best films I've ever seen. The settings and performances are unforgettable. One of Soderbergh's best. The bluray comes with several extra features including another Soderbergh gem, The Underneath in 1080P.",1387584000,13,216,5.575757575757576
6098024,1,B00GPPXNLC,I saw this movie in a theater with My Father In Law and my wife's Uncle both of which were born and raised in St. Louis.  Both really loved the City but hated this movie.  That's about all that needs to be said.,1387584000,2,211,3.883720930232558

6098026,5,B00GPPXNLC,"Steven's Soderbergh's wonderful movie now in blu-ray and looking even better than ever. Engrossing, captivating and everything a really good film should be. I've seen it several times over the years and each time I find something new. It has one of Jesse Bradford's first performances and look for a very young, pre-oscar Adrien Brody. Also a wonderful Spalding Gray. As a surprise extra you'll find in the package yet another Soderbergh movie. The little known ""The Underneath."" Be sure to watch the extras of this disc after you view the film and you'll find out what Steven Soderbergh really thinks of it. Fascinating stuff from one of our great directors.",1412121600,4,659,4.945945945945946
6098027,5,B00GPPXNLC,"I bought this when it came out on blu-ray but then didn't watch it for awhile because I thought it would be too sad.  It is not.  In fact, it's rather sophisticated in its refusal to side with any character or to place the blame for a bad situation on the father who would appear to deserve it.  It's a remarkable debut film.  I will watch it again.",1409702400,4,349,4.088235294117647
6098028,5,B00GPPXNLC,I rented this movie years ago on VHS & it was really touching. I live close to the STL St. Louis area so there are many familiarities. We recorded it on DVR from Cable & had it on a laptop but it got erased. On a whim decided to search for it & lo/behold there is was on BluRay!  I had forgotten Adrien Brody is in this & you'll recognized a very young Katherine Heigl as well.  Great casting & a great story. So happy to have this classic in my movie collection.,1401235200,4,463,3.967741935483871
6098029,5,B00GPPXNLC,"Soderbergh's third feature fulfills the early promise of 'Sex,Lies and Videotape'. Stellar direction and performances all around including a young Adrien Brody.",1397260800,,160,6.318181818181818
6098030,5,B00GPPXNLC,"This is actually a movie two-pack and Criterion should have clearly labeled it as ""King of the Hill and The Underneath - two movies by Steven Soderbergh.""  Needless to say, ""King of the Hill"" is a gem; excellent in every way.  ""The Underneath"" is well made but strangely uninvolving. It is interesting and worth watching, and Criterion shouldn't have ignored it on the packaging.  The bonus features are great, the interview with the 93 year old author of ""King of the Hill"" being a real nice extra!",1397174400,7,499,4.712643678160919
6098031,5,B00GPPXNLC,"Personally, supervised by Soderbergh, the transfer for King of the Hill looks fantastic with excellent detail and the warm color palette faithfully preserved.

There is an interview with director Steven Soderbergh who looks back at King of the Hill. He feels that the film looks too beautiful and should have had a rougher edge to it, if he was making today. He talks about the book, what drew him to it and how he went about adapting it. Soderbergh speaks highly of Jesse Bradford and why he cast him as Aaron. As always, the director is honest about his own shortcomings and that of the film.

Also included is an interview with author A.E. Hotchner who wrote the book on which the film is based on. It was a fictionalized account of his experiences growing up during the Great Depression. He talks about writing the book and his life, in particular, his parents.

Against Tyranny is a visual essay about Soderberghs career in terms of narrative. In particular, it analyzes a dream sequence in King of the Hill. This featurette also juxtaposes the linear style of the rest of the film with this rather abstract sequence.

There are six deleted scenes and alternate takes.

Also included is a trailer.

Finally, a treat for Soderbergh fans is the inclusion of The Underneath, a neo-noir that stars Peter Gallagher and Alison Elliott. The director is interviewed and candidly talks about what a disappointing experience it was for him. He deems the film a failure, but it inspired him to re-evaluate his entire career. He talks about what drew him to the film. As always, Soderbergh is an eloquent speaker and talks knowledgably about filmmaking. A trailer for the film is also included.",1395878400,10,1687,4.8
6098032,5,B00GPPXNLC,"I have been waiting for years for 'King Of The Hill' to have a DVD release.  It is a lovely movie (too lovely, according to Soderbergh...but he quibbling with himself).  When I pre-ordered this disc, I had no idea that Soderberg's next feature, a box-office flop called 'The Underneath,' would be included as a 'bonus feature.'  if you're thinking about buying ""K.O.T.H.,' I recommend that when you get to the disc containing 'The Underneath,' that you watch the movie first, AND THEN watch the addendum in which the director talks about the movie.

When 'The Underneath' came out, I was already a Soderbergh fan and I really enjoyed what seemed to me to be a slightly experimental neo-noir.  The director considers it an almost total failure.  OK.  It might have failed to meet his expectations but it's a terrific 'B' movie and worth watching.  It's also hard to find 'The Underneath' on DVD in its proper aspect ration.  Having these two early movies from a great director in one package...with the Criterion treatment...is a fabulous deal.  Take 'em up on it.",1393632000,19,1063,4.823204419889502
6098033,5,B00GPPXNLC,Can't wait to see the HD treatment that Criterion has given this.  Great cast and a very bittersweet portrait of childhood.,1391212800,4,123,4.857142857142857
6098034,5,B00GPPXNLC,"I have read Aaron Hotchner's book and I love this movie adaptation! I have waited years for it to be released on dvd. So many future stars are in this as children, and it is so enjoyable to watch again and again. I have introduced it to students many times and I'm worried my old VHS copy is ready for retirement.",1389484800,11,313,4.147540983606557

8626150,1,B00GPPXNLC,Very disappointed. Both discs were damaged and couldn't be played. I reached out to see if I could have them replaced with no results.,1497052800,,134,4.625
8626151,5,B00GPPXNLC,"It has become my new favorite movie. I loved how it told how it really was during the depression. Today, young people don't know about having to send kids to live with other relatives (if they were lucky enough to have someone) because they could not feed them. Not a fairy tale, folks. Sick mother, father scratching for a living. It showed a boy older than his years surviving.
Terrific acting, Jesse Bradford had the right stuff to portray the young boy.",1485561600,,457,4.585365853658536
8626152,1,B00GPPXNLC,"Walt Disney-ish silly,boring drama with no depth. Good and stiff acting though. Won't ever watch it again.",1442880000,,106,5.294117647058823
8626153,4,B00GPPXNLC,"This is a movie well worth seeing, if you haven't before.  The acting is excellent.  The story is told well though it seems a bit drawn out the second time around.  The historical setting is wonderfully accurate and should especially be viewed by those who think that if you're poor it is your own fault.",1435708800,3,304,4.490909090909091
8626154,5,B00GPPXNLC,"Love this movie. I'm so glad it finally came out on Blu-Ray Criterion! I'm shocked it took so long. My DVD version went missing years ago, and I always checked Amazon for this release, and bought it right away.",1435622400,2,210,4.410256410256411
