4065671,3,B0033XUHAY,"I rented this movie on iTunes and streamed it via AppleTV. I was looking forward to it. Having watched it, I have to say I was disappointed by the commentary from many of the Buddhists. Many of the people interviewed for the documentary know much about the Buddha, but do not know Buddha. The documentary was at its finest when the Buddha was speaking. I recommend this film to those earnestly seeking the Spirit. For those who do buy it or watch it, I would urge you to focus on the words of the Buddha and not the Buddhist commentators. There is great Light in Buddha. Great Light!",1272672000,6,583,4.407407407407407
4065672,1,B0033XUHAY,EVEN FOR A LAYMEN LIKE ME IT WAS TOO SIMPLIFIED AND DID NOT TELL A GOOD STORY.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO THE BEGINNER OR THE EXPERIENCED BUDHIST.  THE ANIMATION WAS THE WORST.  AFTER I WATCHED THIS I DID NOT FEEL ANY MORE ENLIGHTENED AND EVEN FELT LIKE I JUST WASTED 2 HRS OF MY TIME.,1272499200,10,289,4.035087719298246
4065673,4,B0033XUHAY,"This video covers the major stages of The Buddha's life and the key experiences and learnings on his path to enlightenment.  In that sense, it is a wonderful reference for anyone on a spiritual path.  While some of the Buddha's challenges may have been specific to his time, most have their counterparts in our modern world.  The video presents the life and spiritual journey of The Buddha in a very accessible and understandable way.

I liked that the video kept up a fairly fast pace while also giving the more profound teachings of the Buddha their due.  The result is an easy to take in overview of his entire life and teachings...but with meaningful reference points and guidance for anyone with a spritual practice.",1271721600,15,721,4.782258064516129
4065674,5,B0033XUHAY,"I think this movie will satisfy Buddhists as well as those who know nothing of the Buddha.

This isn't a deep exploration of the Buddha's teachings. But I think that's a good thing. Buddhism has been unduly complicated over the 2,500 years since his death. But the core teaching has always been simple.

It's easy to fall into the trap that many contemporary Buddhists fall in to, who seem to want to mystify the most ordinary things. Frankly, I think this does a disservice to the Buddha's teachings, which I believe were intended from the beginning to be simple and straightforward and easily understood.

For those who don't know much about the Buddha:

He never wanted to be worshipped and never claimed to be God or God's son or representative. He only claimed to have found a way to be free of earthly suffering. And one of his highest teachings is to not *cause* the suffering of another.

Like Jesus, he asked his students to practice nonpossession and nonviolence.

----------

As an afterthought, I thought I should mention that the Buddha had separate rules for householders. They were required to practice nonviolence but they were also allowed to have possessions. And they weren't required to practice celibacy like the monks and nuns. In general they were required to practice kindness and honesty. And they were forbidden to earn a living in any way that would cause harm to someone. I don't believe this is covered in the film, so I thought I would mention it for anyone who is interested in learning more about Buddhism.",1271462400,142,1538,4.781132075471698
4065675,5,B0033XUHAY,"This film is made by Tibeten Buddhists without focusing on Tibetan Buddhism.  That's probably what I admire about the film most of all.  They simply told the story of the man we all know as The Buddha.  It's not a propaganda film.

Buddhists do not worship the Buddha, but we do revere him.  In my Buddhist practice (Nichiren Buddhism) we do not have any Buddha statues or worship any person whatsoever for instance; rather, we try to practice and, sure, to a certain extent pay homage to his teachings.  As the saying goes, 'The Buddha is a person, and a person is the Buddha.'  The goal of practicing Buddhism is not to worship, but to become; we practice to attain the same enlightenment as Shakyamuni (aka Gautama, aka Siddarta, et cetera).  What's great about this film is that it represents how the Buddha sought enlightenment.

On the other hand, there are parts of the world where the Buddha is revered as if a god or savior, which is like trying to get rich by counting someone else's money, so it's good to see a film that talks about the man for a change, and again without promoting a particular practice.

They also show a lot of the practices that are often mistaken for Buddhism, and give them a balanced treatment--purely as points of reference rather than opinion.

This film represents the Buddha in a way that is entirely agreeable to those who subscribe to a multitude of viewpoints on the subject of his teaching, and practice them in various ways.  I also believe it's a good film for non-Buddhists who are simply interested in the unique history and undeniable cultural and philosophical impact the Buddha has on hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

On plain production quality:

I liked the animated segments.  I imagine if they used live actors there might be people who would object to how the Buddha and others were portrayed.

Buddhist or not, Richard Gere was the best possible choice to narrate this film.  Hurray for Richard Gere.

The Dalai Llama appears very little in this.  I would have liked to see a bit more of him, as well as other Buddhist leaders who are not Tibetan.

Poets?  What's with the poets?  And there are two of them!  Speaking as someone who has practiced Buddhism for over twenty-two years, they were--to be honest--pretty generic American Buddhists.  They glow, but I don't see why they're in this film.

Actual scholars from multiple universities are very welcome.  It's easy to get practitioners to gush about Buddhism and the Buddha in an idealized or skewed presentation of the facts, but actual scholars are responsible for having some objectivity.

I especially enjoyed seeing all the sites and thousands of years of Buddhist artwork shown in this film.  I have stood and walked where Nichiren stood and walked in Japan--because I just happen to be there actually, not on a pilgrimage of some kind--and seeing this film makes me want to visit the significant locations of Shakyamuni's life.

I highly recommend this film.",1271030400,48,2987,4.779296875
4065676,4,B0033XUHAY,"My wife and I watched this documentary last night when it aired on PBS and enjoyed it very much. The pace, cinemagraphic and informational quality were all very well done. I thought the choice of participants (frequently cut to for ongoing commentary) was pleasing and varied (Asian, Western, Men, Women, Old, Young, Ordained, Lay, Scholars and Poets). Actor Richard Gere as well, was perfect as the unobtrusive narrator. The narration accompanied illustrations that included wonderful footage of modern (timeless) India and a variety of traditional and contemporary Buddhist art (painting and sculpture), and traced the life of Buddha through the main places and cultures of India he lived as they are preserved and appreciated today. (I thought the occasional use of the flowing, simple and whimsically animated graphics was okay in depicting the myths. My wife, not a Buddhist, thought they were a bit too simple and cartoony...)

Overall I thought the show kept a nice balance between presenting Buddha the awakened human being, and Buddha the mythical cosmic being (very little is objectively known of him since it was probably over 300 years after his passing before anything was written down about him, his origins and teachings). Dharma-wise, the content seemed delightfully whole, even, smooth and free of sectarian edges (if anything the approach was more Therevadin oriented, as it kept to basic common themes and really looked at the Buddha the man and not Buddhism the religion). The effect was a teaching very down to earth and applicable to all of us regardless of our beliefs.

I finished the show feeling more inspired to wake up - to meditate, to enjoy life, to pay attention moment by moment and let the natural wisdom and compassion of this moment flow (within and without me). This morning I commented to my wife that my only complaint was that they made the Buddha's remarkable, extraordinary achievement seem somehow ordinary and if not easily attainable, at least easily understandable. She replied that he was obviously a great leader, trained from birth to assume that role, and then he fulfilled that destiny by demonstrating and guiding others through his awakening and teachings. It was a nice secular way to view and appreciate enlightened activity in the world. This obvious fact was something I'd never fully appreciated in all my years of interest in Buddhism. It made his example all the more real and relevant - the perfect balance of mundane and sublime, worldly and spiritual.",1270684800,241,2513,5.097087378640777
4065677,5,B0033XUHAY,"This is one of the very best historical Buddha documentary I've seen in a long, long time. Richard Gere, our great spokesman for his most blessed HHDL and Buddhism narrates this tale with utmost respect and care, along with a great cast of highly revered experts including Robert Thurman, other monks, nuns, poets, writers, and of course, none other than his His Holiness Dalai Lama (HHDL). The docu covers much grounds, including the Buddha's childhood stage, mostly historical and commonly accepted findings of his youth, to his last dying days, covering much intimate details of his search for reaching and attaining enlightenment, hence the Buddha, meaning the Enlightened One. Thanks to the wonderful David Grubin and a great cast and Richard Gere for bringing this to fruition and the most blessed teaching of Buddhism, not just to a Western audience, but to the world.  On a separate but related note, my wish is that this video would one day be widely available and be seen in mainland China for some 1.3 billion plus Chinese to watch and learn from the great teaching of the Buddha, and not the crass, materialism of modern times, hence have a new found respect for Buddhism, for Tibet and its people.",1270684800,99,1210,4.87378640776699

Missing are several things:
-his direct perception of the  mind
-the arising of the Buddha mind as the only antidote to the evils of the world
-the necessity to feel compassion as a bedrock for practice

I will see again, possible I missed these things...",1513900800,,452,4.5
4065690,2,B0033XUHAY,"I watched this on TV last night and I was surprised to see that some Buddhist think their beliefs are comparable with Christianity. Despite what well-meaning people may claim, Buddhas life and teachings are starkly different from those of Jesus Christ. Their backgrounds, morality, and spirituality were drastically different, as were their approaches to life and human advancement.

Buddhas life is known only by texts dated centuries after his life, most of which strongly contradict each other. The written documents we have speaking of Jesus life were written within a few years of his crucifixion, were widespread less than a century later, and contain harmonized details.

Buddha was born into privilege, struggled to find his way, and eventually spent decades as a spiritual guru. Jesus was born poor (Matthew 8:20), was renowned for lifelong virtue (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 1:19), and taught publicly for only about three years.

Buddhism teaches that life is suffering and that ones only hope is to cease to exist upon attaining emptiness. Christ taught that each persons life is meaningful (John 14:3; Matthew 5:22) and capable of happiness (John 10:10) and that the ultimate goal of existence is eternity with God (Revelation 21:34).

Buddhism makes no factual or empirical claimsone either accepts its philosophical approach, or not. Christianity is rooted in history (1 Corinthians 15:3), evidence (Psalm 19:11; Romans 1:2), Scripture (Acts 17:11; John 5:39, 4647), and prophecy (Luke 18:31; 24:27); and it requires a person to make a decision whether to accept or reject Jesus as Messiah (John 3:1718).

Buddha died a revered sage of his people, at a ripe old age. Jesus was brutally executed (Mark 15:24) at the insistence of His own people (Mark 15:1415) while just in His early thirties.

Most importantly, Buddha never claimed to be divine, and his death is considered the end of his story. Jesus Christ claimed to be God (Matthew 26:6365), intended to prove it by His miracles (John 20:3031), and was seen resurrected after His death by His closest friends and family (John 21:14; Acts 1:3).

A Buddhist once asked me why should I accept Christianity? I said that's going to take some  reading if you are truly willing to discover the truths contained in those two opposite beliefs.
Compared with Buddhism, Christianity has several distinguishing features that show that it deserves consideration.

First, while both Christianity and Buddhism have an historical central figure, namely Jesus and Buddha, only Jesus is shown to have risen from the dead. Many people in history have been wise teachers. Many have started religious movements. Siddhartha Guatama, the historical Buddha also called Sakyamuni, stands out among them for having special wisdom and a profound philosophy of life. But Jesus also stands out, and He has confirmed His spiritual teachings with a test that only divine power could pass. Jesus' body of teachings is confirmed by the death and resurrection of His literal bodya fact which He prophesied and fulfilled in Himself (Matthew 16:21; 20:18-19; Mark 8:31; 1 Luke 9:22; John 20-21; 1 Corinthians 15). Jesus deserves special consideration.

Second, the Christian Scriptures are historically outstanding, deserving serious consideration. One could even say that the history of the Bible is so compelling that to doubt the Bible is to doubt history itself since the Bible is the most historically verifiable book of all antiquity. The only book more historically verifiable than the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) is the New Testament. Consider the following:

1) More manuscripts exist for the New Testament than for any other of antiquity5,000 ancient Greek manuscripts, 24,000 in all including other languages. The multiplicity of manuscripts allows for a tremendous research base by which we can test the texts against each other and identify what the originals said.

2) The manuscripts of the New Testament are closer in age to the originals than are any other document of antiquity. All of the originals were written within the time of the contemporaries (eyewitnesses), in the first century A.D., and we currently have parts of manuscript dating back to A.D. 125. Whole book copies surface by A.D. 200, and the complete New Testament can be found dating back to A.D. 250. Having all the books of the New Testament initially written within the times of eyewitnesses means that the books did not have time to devolve into myth and folklore. Plus, their truth claims were held accountable by members of the Church who, as personal witnesses to the events, could check the facts.

3) The New Testament documents are more accurate than any other of antiquity. John R. Robinson in Honest to God reports that the New Testament documents are 99.9 percent accurate (most accurate of any complete antique book). Bruce Metzger, an expert in the Greek New Testament, suggests a more modest 99.5 percent.

Third, Christian ethics has a stronger foundation than Buddhist ethics. Christian ethics is founded in the personal character of God. God is personal and moral. His nature is good, and therefore all actions which align with His goodness are actually good. Whatever departs from His goodness is actually evil. For Buddhists, however, ultimate reality is not understood as personal. But morality by its very nature requires personality. To illustrate, consider the morality of a rock. One does not blame a rock for being used in a murder since it is not a person with moral duties. Rather, the moral duty lies with the person who used that rock for evil purposes. Buddhism lacks the personal framework for moral duty. With Buddhism, karma is the framework for morality. But karma is impersonal. It is akin to a law of nature. Breaking a karmic ""rule"" is not intrinsically evil. There seems to be no significant difference between error (non-moral mistakes) and sin (moral wrongdoing).

Furthermore, many Buddhists even assert that the dualities of ""good"" and ""evil"" ultimately break down. ""Good"" and ""evil"" would be part of maya, the illusory world of sensory reality. The categories of morality are not grand enough to map onto ultimate reality, and enlightened individuals will see that good and evil blur into one. But such a position means that ultimate reality would not be ""good."" It wouldn't be ""evil"" either, but then what assurance exists that ""ultimate reality"" is even a worthwhile pursuit? And what grounds would there be for living a morally good life as opposed to an amoral life without regard for moral distinctions, or an inactive life avoiding moral choices as much as possible? If Buddhism asserts that reality is not ultimately personal and the distinctions between good and evil are not actually real, then Buddhism does not have a true foundation for ethics. Christianity, on the other hand, can point to the character of God as personally founding morality and providing a basis to distinguish good from evil.

Fourth, Christianity rightly appreciates ""desire."" Buddhist ethics seems to have a core difficulty at this point. Sakyamuni taught that tanha, ""desire"" or ""attachment,"" is the root of suffering and is to be dissolved. But some admittedly good things are based on the idea of desire. Love, for example, is ""to desire the good of another"" (John 15:13; 1 John 4:7-12). One could not even love unless one had a degree of attachment in desiring someone else's well-being. In contrast, Christianity teaches that desire is good when it is properly directed. Paul urges Christians to ""desire the greater gifts"" of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1). In the Psalms, we see pictures of worshipers longing for and desiring fellowship with God (Psalm 42:1-2; 84). And, of course, God does not simply act loving, He is love (1 John 4:9; Psalm 136; John 3:16). Sacrificing desire altogether seems to throw out the proverbial baby (love) with the dirty bathwater (suffering).

Fifth is the question ""What do you do with your sin?"" Buddhism has at least two ideas of sin. Sin is sometimes understood as ignorance. It is sinful if one does not see or understanding reality as Buddhism defines it. However, in Buddhism, there is still an idea of moral error termed ""sin."" To do something deliberately evil, to break a spiritual or earthly law, or to desire wrong things, these would be identifiable sins. But, this latter definition of sin points to a kind of moral error that requires real atonement. From where can atonement rise? Can atonement come by adherence to karmic principles? Karma is impersonal and amoral. One could do good works to even the balance, but one cannot ever dispose of sin. Karma does not even provide a context whereby moral error is even moral. Whom have we offended if we sin in private? Karma does not care one way or the other because karma is not a person. Can atonement come by prayer or devotion to a Bodhisattva or a Buddha? Even if those characters could offer forgiveness, it seems like sin would still be left unpaid. They would forgive sin showing it to be excusable; it is not a big deal.

Christianity, on the other hand, has the only adequate theological view of sin. In Christianity sin is moral error. Ever since Adam, humans have been sinful creatures. Sin is real. And it sets an infinite gap between man and bliss. Sin demands justice. But it cannot be ""balanced out"" with an equal or greater amount of good works. If someone has ten times more good works than bad works, then he or she still has bad works on the conscience. What happens to these remaining bad works? Are they just forgiven as if they were not a big deal in the first place? Are they permitted into bliss? Are they mere illusions thus leaving no problem whatsoever? None of these options are suitable.

Concerning illusion, sin is too real to us to be explained away as illusion. Concerning our sinfulness, when we are honest with ourselves we all know that we have sinned. Concerning forgiveness, to simply forgive sin at no cost treats sin like it is not of much consequence even though we know that to be false. Concerning bliss, bliss is not much good if sin keeps getting smuggled in. It seems like the scales of karma leave us with sin on our hearts and bliss either cannot tolerate us, or it must cease being perfect so that we can come in.

Christianity has an answer for sin. No sin goes unpunished, but the punishment has already been satisfied in Christ's personal sacrifice on the cross. God became man, lived a perfect life, and died the death that we deserved. He was crucified on our behalf, a substitute for us, and a covering, or atonement, for our sins. Furthermore, He was resurrected, proving that not even death could conquer Him. He promises the same resurrection unto eternal life for all who put their faith in Him as their only Lord and Savior (Romans 3:10, 23; 6:23; 8:12; 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9; Philippians 3:21).

This is no ""easy believism"" where God, like a janitor, just cleans up all our mistakes. Rather, this is a life-long commitment where we take on a new nature and begin a new relationship with God Himself (Romans 6:1; Ephesians 2:1-10). When a person really believes God is who He says He is in the Bible, and really believes God did what He says He did in the Bible, and a person puts his or her life on that beliefthat person is transformed. He becomes a new creation by the power of God (2 Corinthians 5:17). You cannot stay the same once you have that belief. One could just as easily continue reading the morning paper after realizing his house was on fire. That knowledge (the house is on fire) motivates action and changes your life (stop reading the paper and do something about the fire).

Nor is Jesus simply an answer among many others. All the world's religions have some level of truth in them, but ultimately, Jesus is the only answer to the human condition. Meditation, works, prayernone of these can make us worthy of the infinite and eternal gift of heaven. None of these can undo the sin we've done. Only when Christ pays our sin debt and we place our faith in Him can we be saved. Only then is sin covered, hope assured, and life filled with eternal meaning.

Finally, it is only in Christianity that we can know that we are saved. We do not have to rely on some fleeting experience, nor do we rely on our own good works or fervent meditation. Nor do we put our faith in a false god whom we are trying to ""believe-into-existence."" We have a living and true God, an historically anchored faith, an abiding and testable revelation of God (Scripture), and a guaranteed home in heaven with God.

So, what does this mean for you? Jesus is the ultimate reality! Jesus is the perfect sacrifice for your sins. God offers all of us forgiveness and salvation if we will simply receive His gift to us (John 1:12), believing Jesus to be the Savior who laid down His life for us, His friends. If you place your trust in Jesus as your Savior, you will have absolute assurance of eternal life in heaven. God will forgive your sins, cleanse your soul, renew your spirit, give you abundant life in this world, and eternal life in the next world. How can we reject such a precious gift? How can we turn our backs on God who loved us enough to sacrifice Himself for us?

If you are unsure about what you believe, we invite you to say the following prayer to God; God, help me to know what is true. Help me to discern what is error. Help me to know what is the correct path to salvation. God will always honor such a prayer.

If you want to receive Jesus as your Savior, simply speak to God, verbally or silently, and tell Him that you receive the gift of salvation through Jesus. If you want a prayer to say, here is an example: God, thank you for loving me. Thank you for sacrificing yourself for me. Thank you for providing for my forgiveness and salvation. I accept the gift of salvation through Jesus. I receive Jesus as my Savior. Amen!",1513555200,2,13959,4.839899413243923

If others have an appreciation for such things, then they do, I do not, at all.  For me, enlightenment is wonderful, but fiction is just fiction.",1467244800,,409,4.746478873239437

4065832,2,B0033XUHAY,"It was an interesting portrayal of the life of Buddha. Then a contorted effort to jam Buddhism into the ""Oneness"" movement. The ""Oneness"" movement is for the self to disappear with the ""Enlightenment""  that there is only the Universal ""Collective"". Contrary to ""Oneness"",  the principles of Buddhism are (1) to lead a moral life,  (2) to be mindful and aware of thoughts and actions, and  (3) to develop wisdom and understanding. Buddhism will live well past the ""Oneness"" New Age movement",1465430400,,489,5.0

Though any religion which allows 500 years to pass before written records of its founder's story are created is handicapped by nature.  I mean, imagine if no one had written anything down about George Washington in his prime.  We stand close to 250 years from his birth.  Now wait another 250 years.  Then write his history.

Nevertheless, the ideas that are Buddhism today are fairly sculpted by this program.  It might have been helpful to describe the effects of the axial age on its founder, but perhaps it was outside of its purview.",1457222400,,613,4.836538461538462

4065915,4,B0033XUHAY,"pretty good overall, though there are a few bits of wildly misleading misinformation sprinkled throughout that would serve only to throw a newcomer off the Buddha's scent, perhaps the most egregious example of which is Mr. Gere's statement that at the time of his paranibbana, the Buddha said ""the world was so sweet he could stay another hundred years,"" or words to that effect. right: the man just coming off 45 years of teaching people how to liberate themselves from the endless round of birth-and-death is going to say, ""man, you know i just can't get enough of this endless round of birth-and-death! i wish i could stay chained to it for another hundred years!""

the Buddha thought the world was ""sweet"" like Andy Dufresne thought Shawshank Prison was ""sweet."" that was the entire point of his life, and this film manages to get it precisely backwards (as so many do).

the Buddha's message was (and remains to this day) sufficiently subversive and counter to the ways of the world that relatively few can figure it out or accept it; this is the great pitfall he foresaw when, upon his enlightenment, he despaired of finding anyone who'd understand what he had to teach. now, as then, there's too much dust in most people's eyes, and the teaching gets twisted around into something simple minds can comprehend - which does not describe what the man actually taught. what he taught is, as he himself described it, deep and difficult to grasp, and takes more mental energy to fathom than most people are willing (or able) to expend...with the result that people pass along as the Buddha's teaching stuff they *can* understand...such as that the Buddha thought the world was ""sweet."" it can be frustrating to stand by and witness such nonsense, understanding that this is the reason the Buddha said his teaching will only last 5000 years: its erosion through misapprehension is already well underway.

fortunately, this is just the sort of situation in which the Buddha's teachings on patience and compassion come in handy.",1455753600,,2026,4.883720930232558

This is not unusual for Buddhists texts and it is frankly because Buddhist philosophy is too rhetorical. This has produced the endless canons of Buddhist writings. It all wreaks of hyperbole. What is more, the Buddhist life is very simple and perhaps that's why it isn't so often presented.",1450396800,,472,5.223684210526316

4066042,2,B0033XUHAY,"I watched this video hoping to come away with a deeper understanding of Buddha and a deeper appreciation of Buddhism. On the contrary I found the message/story full of contradictions, loose ends with no rhyme or reason to the teachings/phenomena and a lot of personal interpretations of Buddha's teachings by people I felt were trying to ACT enlightened. E.g. Siddharta abandoned his son, his wife, his father causing a lot of emotional pain and hardship. Where is his karma for this? Just because he sat under a tree and meditated, his karma was cleared and does not have rebirth??? Buddha was suppose to have become enlightened and solved the problem of human suffering, only to have suffering emotions like the rest of us AFTER his awakening. How is that solving the problem of suffering????  Seems like he started off with a special divine type birth (sacred elephant visiting the mother, astrologers predicting him being a world savior) , could do miracles, and had miracles happen at his death. Then the commenters  say we are all just like him and can do the same. Haven't heard of the same (miracles)  in the practitioners of Buddhism.  More questions than answers or inspiration from this video on Buddha.",1413936000,2,1214,4.907317073170732
4066043,4,B0033XUHAY,"Great to watch, with life lessons for everyone, not just Buddhists.  I'd give it 5 stars, but went with 4, because of some minor inaccuracies.  For example, they say he was the son of a king.  In reality, his father was a democratically elected chief.  Many stories of Buddha make this same mistake.  In the end, I suppose it doesn't really matter.  The lessons are the same, no matter who his father was.  To me, he was the greatest man that ever lived.",1413072000,,454,4.397590361445783

4066075,1,B0033XUHAY,"There are only two schools of Buddhism, the Northern School (Mahayana) and the Southern School (Theravada), and each school has many traditions (denominations, per se).  While Tibetans like to think of their Buddhist tradition as a unique and separate school, it nonetheless clearly falls within the Northern School -- Mahayana. This film, like many American and British made films about Buddhism, focuses almost exclusively on the perspective of ONE particular Mahayanan tradition. It is tantamount to making a film about Christianity and only showing the perspective of Pentecostal Church of God fundamentalist, feet washing, snake worshipping, exceedingly superstitious Christians. Most traditions within Buddhism are highly pragmatic in nature and non-superstitious. Buddhism is entirely something you DO -- not at all something you believe. At no point in the Buddha's teachings did he ever ask anyone to BELIEVE anything whatsoever. And many will be surprised to learn, especially Americans it seems, that not only did the Buddha not teach reincarnation but he actually cited it as one of the reasons he rejected Brahmanism/Hinduism. And this perspective is not a ""watering down"" of Buddhism as most Tibetan and a few other traditions might argue. It is original Buddhism from the earliest Buddhist texts. Unfortunately, its just not very exciting to make a documentary about a simple practice that is void of dogma, artsy-fartsy silliness, and superstition.",1406764800,15,1464,5.535714285714286

4066097,4,B0033XUHAY,"I ordered this DVD as a Christian seeking to understand Buddhism. I think it is a very good overview of Buddhism and I learned a great deal about both Siddhartha and the philosophy he espoused.

The video begins by retelling the life story of Siddhartha, later known as the Buddha. The video touches on his youth as a wealthy, noble ""prince"" - for lack of a better term - in a small Indian kingdom. The DVD emphasizes his privileged birth and early life and his encounters with ""suffering"" when he left his palace for short rides with an attendant.

It will seem quite apparent to the viewer that Siddhartha was deeply touched by the suffering he encountered and that his search for answers was a sincere one in which he gave up his wealth and position to seek answers. The DVD retells the stories of Siddhartha as he attached himself to gurus, learning yoga and meditation techniques in order to find the answers he sought.  He did not find the answer and continued in his search, adopting asceticism, punishing and starving his body to reject the material world. According to the DVD, Siddhartha realized that his asceticism had not led to the answers he sought.

The video then gives his discovery of the ""middle way"" as he finds the enlightenment he had sought for years. The DVD gives a fairly good overview of Buddhist concepts such as the Four Noble Truths which lead into the concepts of the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Immeasurables. The DVD attempts to simplify the rather abstract concepts of Buddhism though it does not always succeed - to this viewer at least.

I felt the DVD did a good job of showing the viewer the basics of Siddhartha's journey and the religion he founded. I found it odd, though, that a PBS production essentially told the story without any kind of skepticism in regard to the stories of the Buddha or the tenets of the religion. There were certainly no ""opposing points of view"" that are offered in their videos about Jesus or Christianity.

That aside, I did learn a great deal about Buddhism as well as how it came to be from the mind of one man in the time and place he lived in. I feel the time I spent watching this DVD was well spent. Four stars.",1395360000,,2194,4.527777777777778
4066098,5,B0033XUHAY,"I have watched this dvd 1000 times. Not only do I learn about the history and story of the Buddha, the production is superior, I first saw this air on PBS, but the little bit of the teachings of the Buddha that seep through are very interesting and comforting, even enlightening! The artwork is beautiful, Richard Gere and Bonnie Blair are terrific narrators. I love this dvd.",1395360000,,376,4.626865671641791
4066099,5,B0033XUHAY,"An easy to understand discussion on Buddhism from historical, spiritual, and cultural perspectives.  The format of the movie consists of a variety of people, who are very knowledgeable, discussing their own observations and experiences.  The result is that you get to learn about Buddhism from a poet, psychiatrist, professor, monk, writer, historian, etc.  It's very interesting to see the various points of view; each one is different and valid.",1394928000,,447,5.449275362318841
4066100,5,B0033XUHAY,"As a student of the Buddha, I enjoyed this show very much. A lot of people ask me about Buddhism, what it is and what is it all about. I feel that this show explains that in an imformative, as well as entertaining manner. It is very well done and I watched it twice the first day I received it. If you are interested in finding out about the person we all know as ""The Buddha"", and have no clue as to who he was and what Buddhism is, this show would be a great place to start. I also recommend Tich Nhat Hahns books about Buddhism. He gets it, and can teach it in a way you can understand it. I am glad I bought this and will watch it many times, particularly with someone who wants to know about Buddhism. It is fact...not fiction and does not dwell on the fictional side of The Buddha. There is also comments from people including the Dali Lama that focus on the true nature of life and Buddhism.

Love, forgiveness is the theme of both. I was hit how denying wealth, elitism, and all that goes with it leads one to the light.
To see Buddha give it all up and discover through that middle path confirmed in me that money elitism, Conservatism as in Both stories of my heroes, Jesus and Siddartha were not the praise issues of their lives.",1391385600,,520,4.158415841584159

Most  westerners  are  ingrained  with  dogma & theology  so  many  come  trying  to  apply  the  same  mindset  to  Buddhism  which  is  dysfunctional .
Siddhartha  was  really  one  of  the  early  psychologists  except  instead  of  analyzing  other  people ,  he  was  analyzing  how  his  own  mind  worked  with  respect  to  ""why  people  suffer""  and  how  can  they  ""move  beyond  suffering"" .
There  has  been  2500 years  of  evolution  since  his  time  so  there  are  many  sects  with  differing  takes  but  a  fundamental  awareness  of  the  human  issues  related  to  suffering  is  an  eternal  thread .

4066147,4,B0033XUHAY,"Some of the stories may have strong impact on you. For example, in the time between his self-deprivation and before the attainment of complete enlightenment, he attended a Sprint Planting Festival during which he saw the destruction of life in the soil due to the techniques of modern farming, the plowing of fields. Upon realizing this he cried. Does this indicate his growing compasion for all forms of life? Does it indicate his level of despair in being unable to see a way for mankind to survive without taking life? Both? The story goes on to say that immediately after that event he became determined to sit under a tree and not move from that place until either enlightenment occurred or he died without it. That may be exactly the posture of heart-mind it will take to bring humanity to the same level as Buddha. We will see.

Also, the part of his story that flies in the face of conventional wisdom is his leaving his wife and son, his family and friends, his whole lifestyle behind. We, in much of the modern world, tend to ignore that aspect of the spiritual path even though, for Christians, the Gospel of Luke states; ""If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."" This is recorded in Luke 14:26. This gives us an idea of the level of commitment-need-desire required to break free of the encumbrances in our lives.

4066185,5,B0033XUHAY,"This PBS documentary The Buddha by David Grubin is an inspired re-telling of the ""great renunciation"" of Prince Siddhartha and the transformation of a once confused, worldly, man born to comfort and privilege, to that great renunciate and god of the Tropics, Buddha.

The film begins with a moving account of how the mind of the Prince awakens to harsher realities of the world outside his palace walls. The hypnotic beauty of Gautama's early life narrative and his odyssey to sainthood through penance to ""Nirvana"" force us to wonder if all spiritual roads lead back to ancient India. Could the quest for ultimate answers be already given by this sage of sages?

The film eloquently reminds us that the relevance of the teachings of the great god of the tropics is more urgent now than it has ever been.

As I was watching the critical early synopsis of Gautama's metamorphosis, I was struck by the similarities in Gautama's quest for perfection and the pleading for a loftier humanism in the writings of Matthew Arnold, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Soren Kierkegaard. But those similarities quickly evaporated when the language-centered worldviews of these western sages, their poetic responses to the problem of life that have molded our modernist sensibilities for so long, stand in striking contrast to the unique mode of quietism recommended by the eastern sage. Desire and power will have its place in Gautama's world but in a radically altered, muted, and austere form.

Happiness, as Gautama discovers, is essentially the absence of desire. Some desire is good. How else could the great quest for enlightenment, Siddhartha's perfectionist experiment, even begin without the desire of a renunciate? The Dalai Lama in a crucial interview in the film offers this distinction between the desire of Mara, the crafty temptor, often an obstacle in the quest for happiness, and the forgotten austere mode of desire that renounces and liberates life as we know it.

Absence of suffering, as W.S. Merwin clarifies, is spiritual stillness. The renunciate overcomes the incurable basis of life, the restlessness of the mind. In its natural state, a mind devoid of the culture of renunciation is like a monkey leaping around from one tree of attachment and addiction to another. Buddha will use this metaphor to remind us what the mind is importantly NOT in its attained fullness. The essence of the mind emerges after the renunciate triumphs over its true nature. Happiness can emerge only from a life enshrined in quietism.

Richard Gere's narration in this film has an unpretentious, even glowing, calm to it. It complements nicely the larger pacific rhythms of the message and the story. The interviews with W.S. Merwin and the Dalai Lama have a richness to it that forever marks the listener by the spell of Buddha's message. It alternatively comes with the infectious laughter and wisdom of the Dalai Lama, his firm but happy way of retelling the truth of the Dhammapada. The great W.S. Merwin has an eloquence that is disarming. He has a way of paraphrasing Buddhist wisdom that is unforgettable. The caste of characters also include several monks, a psychoanalyst, two professors of Buddhism, including the erudite Robert Thurman, and an inspired Buddhist poet from Princeton, Jane Hirshfield.

A film to watch and savor the eternal allure of this great God of the tropics.",1364169600,,3394,5.07168458781362

4066194,5,B0033XUHAY,This is a very clear and cogent story of the Buddha's search for the answer to suffering.

I loved it and felt nourished and more open after watching it several times.  The animation is simple and delightful. The message is clear and needs No judgement which our Western minds LOVE TO DO!  Just enjoy and feel good that these thoughts and practices live in our world and that they come out of countries rich in spirit, art, and wisdom.
Consider leaving your Western mind at home and all the stuff we are trained into about how valuable constructive criticism is and how everything could be done better, etc.

Just curious why the enlightened spiritual leaders choose to be reincarnated after working so hard to attain nirvana?

Anyway, it answered a lot of questions I had, but there's a lifetime of learning yet. I'd recommend this to anyone curious about the history of Buddhism.

I give it 4 stars, but I really would have loved to seen or heard Gere in this, as several posters said that he was in it.

There was no entertainment value or self-improvement value to it whatsoever. In watching this documentary, it will be painfully clear how a person who gains unique insights to life generates a following of people who then completely distort and misinterpret his teachings and turn them into a religion. The followers of Buddhism are seen performing rituals and ceremonies and worshiping idols as if doing so conveys some special favor or wisdom.

His success in this quest led to him being known as the Buddha.

He became jaded after a trip outside his palace, where he saw an old man, a sick man, and a corpse.  He came to the conclusion that life involves suffering -- aging, sickness, and death -- and sought a means to overcome it.  After years of practicing intense and rigorous self-denial, Siddhartha was still unable to arrive at his goal.  He gave up his ascetic practices and one day, after meditating under a tree, attained Enlightenment.

I enjoyed the fact that it not only covered the mythology behind this great man but also the real story of his life. The life lessons he learned along the way and the many things that others can gleam from his experiences.  I also loved the part about the life of man is not about living in luxury or living in poverty it is about balance between the two. Taking what you require and leaving the rest for others.

Likely, it is a simplification in order to address those of little patience. However, I believe many important aspects are unfortunately missing. For example...although modern Buddhism stems from Siddharta Gautama, he was not the only ""Buddha"". Furthermore, the simplification of dukkha (""suffering"", etc.) is lacking in much of what was trying to be conveyed. Although I am an Orthodox Christian, I sincerely respect that which ""the"" Buddha was trying to teach. If you truly want to understand the teachings of Buddha without having to read the various sutras (discourses, scriptures), I recommend listening to the very open and non-biased (at least in my opinion) discussions led by Joseph Goldstein.

4066237,5,B0033XUHAY,"This 2 hour documentary takes the viewer on the journey of the man who would one day be called ""the Buddha"", being translated the ""enlightened one"", or ""awakened one"".

He was born Siddhartha Gautama 500 years before Christ Jesus to a noble warrior caste in northern India.  Because he was born into wealth, he had every opportunity to indulge in his fleshly desires, which he did until he was around the age of 29. Although he had every material comfort, he was unhappy and unsatisfied.  It was at that time he left home, wife, and child on what could only be called a spiritual quest.

At first his tried detaching himself from the world and riches and pleasures.  This was the dominant relgious practice of his day.  This was done by practically starving oneself, owning nothing, living outside.  It was thought that the flesh separated oneself from the spiritual; hence, he tried to put to death the needs of his flesh.  He did this for 6 years.  In the end, he realized that this too, was not the answer, just like indulging the flesh was not the answer either.

Finally the Buddha realized the ""middle path"" or ""third way"" of living was the best practice of living.  In other words, avoiding the extremes.  This formed the foundation of his teachings, along with the ""4 noble truths"". {please Google the 4 noble truths for a deeper study}

Richard Gere does an excellent job narrating the film, which also features interviews with Buddhism experts as they explain the life of Buddha and his philosophy.  The film also has really great art work edited into the film along with live-action scenes of current day India.

4066238,3,B0033XUHAY,"I love the story of the Buddha and could listen to it over and over.  This is a nicely done retelling, including graphics/cartoons.  My problem with this film is that the director chose to have a bunch of white americans tell this story.  I think the film maker should have gotten Indians to tell this story, since it really is an Indian myth, not an american one -- and they probably could have told it better.  Most of the talking heads who tell portions of the story in this film are very annoying (particularly that poet woman).  They all have that zoned out, disembodied demeanor that is too common in american spiritual seekers.  I wish I could tell our entire country that this neutered demeanor has absolutely nothing to do with spiritual practice, but rather occurs when one is trying to ACT like he or she is a ""spiritual person.""  Bob Thurman is, of course, a complete exception.  There is nothing inauthentic or watered down about Mr. Thurman.  I wish he had told the whole story.  Gere's narration was fine, too.",1289865600,5,1025,4.613259668508287

4066240,5,B0033XUHAY,"I am very excited that this documentary will be shown on a wide scope. In light of all the exposure Buddhism has received lately, ie. Tiger Woods, this documentary is necessary. I think it will shine a light on something most people have no understanding of, and some may be confused about.

The story of ""The Buddha"" is narrated by Richard Gere, and key points are driven home by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Robert Thurman, Mark Epstein and many more scholars and monastics. PBS has done a fantastic job in employing David Grubin to make this film. It is done so with not only an open mind, but with true acknowledgment of the wisdom the Buddha achieved.

""The Buddha"" is a fantastic story, infused with myth and wonder. It is the tale of a man who was struck by the suffering in the world and vowed to do what he could to find the end to that suffering. Through renunciation of worldly desires he broke through the cloud of misunderstanding and found the truth of true experience. He blazed a path of freedom for the rest of us to follow. Not a dogmatic path, but one that does, and will work, if enough effort is put forth.

The film has the same approach the Buddha taught, cutting through it all and telling it like it is. There are some nice graphic touches, reminiscent of most PBS films, that play well into the film.",1286150400,,1326,4.426229508196721

4066244,4,B0033XUHAY,"I just rented this on Netflix, and found it very lovely, for both experienced Buddhists and those new to it. It revolves around the story of the Buddha's life, as told in the first sutras (Buddhist scripture) on the subject, which began appearing around 500 years after the Buddha's passing. Richard Gere narrates the sutra portion of the story, while beautiful Buddhist artwork from around the world is displayed, interspersed with shots of sacred Buddhist historical sites, and some original graphics. The artwork in particular is stunning, and of course Richard Gere's voice contributes a lovely and peaceful depth to the telling.

At each phase of the Buddha's life story, cutaways to well-known Buddhist academics, teachers and writers are incorporated, including the Dalai Lama, Robert Thurman (the first American ordained as a Buddhist monk, acclaimed Buddhist author and speaker, and professor of Buddhist studies at Columbia University), Mark Epstein (Buddhist psychotherapist and author, and frequent contributor to the Buddhist magazine Tricycle), W.S. Merwin (practicing Zen Buddhist and acclaimed poet), and Jane Hirshfield (also a practicing Zen Buddhist and acclaimed poet.) Many others are featured as well. My favorite quotes were from Ms. Hirshfield, including this one:

""It's alright to feel what human beings feel, and we are not supposed to turn into rocks or trees when we practice Buddhism. Buddhists laugh, cry, dance, feel ecstasy, probably even feel despair. It is how we know the world. It is how we live inside of our hearts, not disassociated from them.""

I wish all of the commentators were so well-spoken. My only reservation about this film (and the reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars) is that I did feel it became bogged down by some of the academic commentators. They were (not to put too fine a point on it) rather dull at times, which made the story drag. But this was only occasionally - overall this documentary offers a beautiful version of the Buddha's story, and much insight into Buddhist practice and wisdom. I recommend it for anyone.",1280793600,,2083,5.120588235294117
4066245,5,B0033XUHAY,"This is a well-designed and paced documentary on the life of the Buddha (I have read a few and this is a great synopsis.) It is presented through soundbites from artists, poets, monks and others. We also get the stories augmented with drawings or watercolors. The narration is by Richard Gere.  This is a short review but it is not easy to include the details of the presentation without giving a presentation. Beside the different insights into Buddhism, the thing that I took away was the different locations where Buda was born, died, and received enlightenment.

I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, there is a small documentary on the making of the documentary. You will need to re watch the presentation as it is packed with information and ideas that do not give you too much time to think in-between.

4066246,5,B0033XUHAY,"I couldn't recommend this documentary more highly. There is a perfect balance of narrative, telling of miracles, and simple teaching in order to bring a calming sense of wonder to understanding the Buddha's life. The colorful animation brings the Buddha's long ago lived world to life with the amazement of a fairy tale. The colors shift from peaceful pastels in the joyous occasions and hardens into darker tones as Siddharta encounters the many facets of reality. The music selected lets the thoughts of the mind drift into the narrative and reflections of the Buddha's life and way of pursuing a middle way towards happiness. You can feel your soul rise with the Buddha as the notes climb towards the sky.

Various people (Jane Hershfield and His Holiness the Dali Lama being my favorites) give simple tenants of Buddhism where it is needed and compare and contrast with thoughts common to the west. The professors of Philosophy or Eastern Studies do not try to stuff too much dry lecture, yet keep the Buddha's reality in perspective when we flow along with the journey towards the Enlightened One's discovery and teaching.

The documentary above all stresses that the Buddha indeed carries his wisdom within us and that we can all follow in the middle way. There is a gentle handling of the Buddha's death, in which there is not despair, but joy in knowing that the way to enlightenment is carried on through every being. No need for salvation, no burdens of a punishing or rewarding afterlife, no shame in being human. For to start achieving enlightenment, one must first eat.",1277337600,6,1582,4.877323420074349
