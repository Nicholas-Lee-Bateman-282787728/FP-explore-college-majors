8047889,5,B0007L6NK8,"What I like about this movie is that in addition to it being very funny, it's also a great timeless satirical picture of the social hierarchy.

A journalist Francois Perrin (Pierre Richard) is ""bought"" as a toy by a very spoiled boy of the president of a company. Little by little, the boy's eyes open, and with the help of his new toy he starts seeing the world in its true colors. Their relationship, filled with funny adventures, evolves into a true friendship, something which the father has been unable to achieve.

Richard is, as always, great. Excellent family movie.",1245715200,2,574,4.73
