8746771,5,B01A9R5MYM,Not your average samurai film at all!  This is a slow moving heavily emotional story of the collapse of the samurai in 13th century Japan as seen from the viewpoint of one family.  Yes there are some fight scenes but they are subordinate to the story of suicide and revenge against a feudal lord and the rigid social system. Beautifully done and xlnt 3D. Plays perfectly in USA 3D blu-ray players.,1460332800,,397,4.577464788732394
