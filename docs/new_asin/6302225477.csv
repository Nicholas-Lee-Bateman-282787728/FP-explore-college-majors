7822792,1,6302225477,"Abbott & Costello's Who's on First is great, but this copy is a flop.  I purchased it and anticipated watching the comedy team I remembered watching in the 70's on our black& white tv.  This version is taken from a 1950's early tv show that is very grainy and the sound is inconsistant.  This Who's On First is part of a tv  variety show and it is not the polished version I remembered from the Sunday morning movie or from the radio show.  This is not worth the $.  It was very disappointing!  Try to get your copy somewhere else.  This one is boxed with an Errol Flyn movie that I didn't even bother opening.  The quality of the picture and sound was that bad. My kids were really disappointed.",991440000,22,696,4.292307692307692
