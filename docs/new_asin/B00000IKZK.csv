1223041,5,B00000IKZK,"This is when Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma journey to Namek for the Namek dragonballs to save their friends that died in the battle with Nappa and Vegeta. All the way up to  episode 53 it puts you on the edge of your seat  waiting for more and more to unfold leading all the way up to when Goku  starts to go Super Saiyan. It's a must have. I have why don't you?",924134400,,358,3.9444444444444446
1223042,5,B00000IKZK,"im an avid cartoon observer for many years. Not only do i see them for a quick laugh but i closely monitor the action, scenery, plot, and dialogue. As we watch animations now days (from all over the world), we have  to understand the cultural differences and respect them or else the  dialogue will sound corny(as ours may be too revealing or too strong for  other cultures). Humor also changes (try  translating a joke into a foreing  language). Arriving to a conclusion: DBZ ( after crossing the cultural  barrier)is a plausible animation. The motivation of the characters is pure.  It is the unbrakable spirit and the way they (the characters) present  themselves in the worst of times that compels you to keep wathing these  series (too bad we don't have the rest yet). The battling of evil in a  personal way and the way  nature and living things are treated with  respect(again, culture)is fabulous. Evil vs good work towards one  particular issue in DBZ, to help others vs selfish power and pleasure  respectively. LETS LEARN SOMETHING FROM IT... sincerely TC",924134400,,1066,4.85
1223043,5,B00000IKZK,These set is the best. Dragon Ball Z has managed to do it again. This is the best set with head to head action. I reccomend it to anyone,924048000,,136,3.7241379310344827
1223166,5,B00000IKZK,this is a cool saga becase there is so much going on and there are twists and turns everywhere.  There is a lot a fighting also.  If your a fan of dbz this one collection you don't want to miss!,951264000,2,194,3.825
1223167,5,B00000IKZK,I LIKE DRAGON BALL Z ALOT BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW  I CAN GET \THE ALL EPISODES OR SERIES PLEASE I NEED YOUR HELP BECAUSE I LOVE,949104000,3,126,3.5
1223168,5,B00000IKZK,"The Namek Saga is a great set.  We are introduced to many new characters including King Kai, Freiza and the Ginyu Force.  Similar to the first box set the only problems with this is the censorship and dubbing problems.  But for fans of the dubs, this set is a great item.",946425600,5,271,4.2745098039215685
1223169,5,B00000IKZK,"If you like good animation, good voice acting and a wide variety of characters, this is the movie set for you. It may even shed a tear in your eye. When Goku changes into a different being, it made me go back into my  library of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z movies before it to admire what  kind of person Goku was. Freiza better power up to 100%  of his power  Quickly!",943920000,5,371,4.041095890410959
1223170,5,B00000IKZK,"Hey, if you love the first two sagas, just wait until you get ahold of the Frieza saga!!!  Death of Vegeta and Krillin, as well as Goku finally becoming a Super Saiyan....the best animated climax I have ever  anticipated!!!  But we all know that you cannot die on the show (just go to  another demension), so be patient, cuz ya know that Vegeta will return to  become a SUper Saiyan himself next season, and I'm sure Krillin is sure to  return (You didn't think Goku would just live his life without his best  friend now, did you?)",940204800,6,531,4.412371134020619
1223171,5,B00000IKZK,"You know, I've seen these episodes on Cartoon Network and I think they are pretty good. I just wish that Funimation wouldn't tone them down soooooo much. But hay Piccolo is in it so it rocks. :)",939427200,,194,4.27027027027027
1223192,5,B00000IKZK,"The spanish version is really good, I saw it on the spanish channel Telemundo, anyone know where they seel the Spanish version on video.  If you do please email me.",937008000,,164,4.466666666666667
1223193,3,B00000IKZK,"I have seen this series with the origional japanese dialogue, and needless to say this english version is a far cry from the intensity of the orgionals.  Did you know there are well over two hundred fifty episodes to  this series?  I cannot remember exactly how many... all I know is I want  every last one- uncut and uncensored!  The voices for Gohan, Kurillin, and  Vegita in the english version are pathetic.  Episodes are missing from the  Namek Saga and, quite frankly, it is a shame.  I would like to see the  whole set, unabridged and not tainted by censorship.  Dragonball Z is a  violent series, much like Fist of the North Star... with comedy.  As to  when FUNinamtion will get off its rear and give us hungry DBZ fans what we  really want (everything, of course) and not give us this non-fat version...  who knows?  They should stop treating this like a kid's show and treat it  the way it was meant to be treated.  Oh, by the way... did anyone know  there is another Dragonball series after Dragonball Z?  As slow as  FUNimation is with getting the episodes out, it probably won't reach  american shores until 2003.  It's a crying shame...",932256000,23,1151,4.556650246305419
1223194,1,B00000IKZK,"People, if you want to see the REAL version of Dragonball Z, then please buy a subtitled episode. The english version is too stupid. They have to cut out the GOOD PARTS. Like the bad lanuage & violence. What's wrong  with that? The lanuage maybe, but the blood?Come on, they have blood on the  Bat-man series. I can wait to see the new english dubbed episodes of  Dragonball Z when they finish the Freeza saga. Oh and I have a tape of the  english dubbed, that's from one of the new english dubbed episodes. And  they SUCK!!!!!! Have you heard the voices?!! There terrible!!!!!!! God,  what has FUNImation been smokin' latly? I want the OLD voices back!!!!!!  Krillin sounds like the voice of Stimpy  on Ren And Stimpy, Nail's voice doesn't even match him, (Infacted, I sorta  like Nail's voice, it should go with Vegeta's voice) Gohan sounds  WWWWWWWWWAAAAYYYYYYYY different. And the rest, well, just see the new  episodes to find out what I mean. I only give the 1 star to the ENGLISH  DUBBED for their crappy way on editing the ""REAL"" Dragonball Z.  If it was the japenese version, I could give it all the stars in the world.",930700800,,1128,4.552238805970149
1223205,2,B00000IKZK,"I cannot blame the people who wrote and censored the ""americanized"" dragon ball z , episodes for making it a cheasy Pokemon esque type of anime . Funimation , atleast tried to make this show  hit in the US . If it weren't the effort of Funimation to even bring Dragon  Ball Z into an ""American-children-audiance"" genre I would give  this a -1 star if they had it . As you can see by the ""real"" fans  that this was way censored , I mean theres so many goofy lines that its sad  . Take for example on one of the episodes , like when the news chopter was  blasted by Napa , Teinshin yelled out , ""wait they are ok , I see them  with parashutes!"" when you can clearly see the chopter is burnt to  bits . Well if you are an anime fan and want to see why Dragon Ball Z is  great , then I would recomend you to try and find an uncut version of  Dragon Ball Z. By saying Uncut I mean its realistic , better in story , and  plain out good .",930268800,3,931,3.8473684210526318
7910793,1,B00000IKZK,"Please, this dubbed anime is even worse than Sailor Moon in English.  It's been mangled to the core.  Editing to the extreme, skipping about 16 episodes, changing the attacks.  It's seriously the worst dub I've seen...
(And that Rock the Dragon Music Video is the pits of 1995!)",1058313600,3,278,4.75
7910794,5,B00000IKZK,"this saga is the last great saga their is on DragonBall Z.
this was a perfect backround for showing how evil Frieza is and Vegeta's quest to seek the DragonBalls out and wish for immortality. Now why should you get this(or at least see it) it has excellent battles and story. The newer episodes of Dbz have no story and are corney and kiddy and no fun to watch. It's also great in the fact that the old voices and animation are still here(another down side to the newer episodes is that they don't have them)I personnaly recommend this to any true Dbz fan and NOT to the people who like only newer episodes and newer power levels thats why I recommend this or the saiyan conflict over any saga out there",1008547200,2,703,4.333333333333333
7910795,3,B00000IKZK,"First of all, I'm sure if you've heard reviews like these saying how much better the Japanese versions of DBZ are. No, these aren't as good the Japanese version, but its better than nothing. I can understand if people want to get these because the sub-titles can be quite difficult to come by. Anyway, I gave it three stars because I couldn't give it a zero, because the stories there and because there aren't quite as many edits, but there are still a lot of things missing(Even whole episodes!). Can you believe they actually say die!! Wow, that's just terrible, after hearing that I found out that when someone gets shot through the chest with an energy beam, they don't go to ""Another dimension"", they(get this)die. What a concept.",995846400,,735,4.705426356589148
7910796,4,B00000IKZK,"As a loyal viewer and fan of DBZ, I naturally appreciate this saga.  The plot is better than most anime sagas,and the characters are well thought out.  And, of course, you get your share of intense actions sequences.  But, as most of the other reviewers have and will tell you, the English version just isn't up to par with the Japanese [sound familiar to those of you who play video games?] The language and fight scenes are heavily edited, and the power levels have gone to hell in a handbasket.  This was originally a show for adults, not children. For people who have no experience with DBZ, I'll provide a brief synopsis for the English version.  Good plot, great fight scenes, great characters, and the suspense kills you.  The down side: cheesy American expressions and idioms during intense moments, the usual problems with anime [can-opener noses, f^^ked-up facial expressions].  If filter through ...[the bad parts], you will find an excellent show.",994723200,,959,4.919254658385094
7910797,3,B00000IKZK,"This saga is really, really slow for the most part.  But it is a great set-up for the next box set, which is the battle with the rest of the Ginyu and Freaiza.  Alot of plot development went in this Saga.",978134400,,204,3.951219512195122
7910798,5,B00000IKZK,"I just found a review I posted for these episodes in August of last year and I can't believe how absolutely naive I was when I wrote it.  Since then I have came into contact with the DBZ SUBTITLED movies and all I can really  say is that the subbed version cannot even be called the same thing as the  original.  Don't get me wrong, if it hadn't been for FUNmation for first  introducing DBZ to me, I'd have never loved it but the subtitled is sooo  much better!  I believe my words last time called it ""boring and a  waste of time.""  I'm sorry if anyone read that and didn't watch the  subbies because they certainly deserve being seen.  I gave these episodes a  ""5"" rating not because FUNmation did a good job, but because DBZ  is available to us here in American to begin with and because others are  able to watch it.  God bless!",958089600,4,833,4.2165605095541405
