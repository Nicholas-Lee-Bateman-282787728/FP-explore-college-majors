8103686,5,B000E10ERE,"These dvd's are great!  I bought them recently for my niece and nephew.  I thought this would be a great way to get them interested in learning about the bible, and boy was I right!  From the moment I popped this in the dvd player, my niece and nephew were both hooked.  How great is it that now they ask me ""Aunt Amanda, can we watch the Bible movie?""  If you want to help teach your kids about the Bible and keep them entertained at the same time, then I highly recommend The Animated Kids Bible dvd's.  You may learn a thing or two as well!",1384732800,,543,4.0754716981132075
8103687,3,B000E10ERE,"Some things about this video are well done.  It's interesting enough.  But the whole time, you're wondering if the producers were out to undermine biblical faith.  Adam, in particular, looks and talks and acts like a complete goofball.  It's bizarre how goofy he is, and impossible to believe that the producers didn't spend a lot of time laughing at what they made.  I gave it three stars because we borrowed it from the library; it would be even less if we had purchased it.",1308700800,2,476,4.619047619047619
8103688,1,B000E10ERE,"Short and simple end of it, the dvd is super cheesy an inaccurate.  You will be sorely dissapointed if you purchase any of the series.  I actually own the whole thing and have only watched one and a half episodes with my son.  I couldn't watch it anymore.",1266537600,3,255,4.270833333333333
