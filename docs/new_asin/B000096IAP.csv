It shows 6 great guitarists playing music that they call ""celtic"" but really only about a quarter of them could you call them that by listening to them. Most are in the alternate tuning DADGAD but some are in other tunings. The best thing is the DVD can be put into a computer and gives you the tablature to print. It is also great to just watch/listen to. The slow music is amazingly relaxing and the faster ones are great too. It is for only good fingerstyle (no flatpicking) guitarists that use the dadgad or other tunings. If you use standard tuning the music is untranslatable because the low strings are lowered too far down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1120262400,9,771,4.718518518518518
