8183246,5,B000O76Q0M,"Corsica is a small island that belongs to France; it is most famous for being the birthplace of Napoleon. Those of us who are American of Corsican descent are very small in number, and have a proud heritage not too well known by many, even amongst our own. This hilarious movie presents a good view of the Corsican culture, including the food, musical tradition (male a cappella groups who sing mostly sacred music), and the gorgeous landscape of the island itself. This film is a must-see for anyone who loves comedy-thrillers, and who loves (or hates) the French.",1415404800,,565,4.775510204081633
8183247,5,B000O76Q0M,"We find it hard to understand how anyone could give this less than a five-star rating (except the person who complained about the transfer to dvd, who has a different version than we do).  Saw this in French on the way back from Paris several years ago and ordered it from Amazon France the next day.  We needed to buy a universal dvd player to view it and it was well worth the trouble.  Every time we watch this (which is often) we find another subtle joke.  There are layers upon layers of humor, as in ""Shakespeare In Love"".
  The French version of the FBI hires bumbling private detective Jack (Christian Clavier) to find  cunning Corsican separatist Ange (Jean Reno), and his nicotine addicted sidekick Mateo (Pierre Salasca), but everything turns around when the detective falls for the Corsican's beautiful sister (and Mateo's ex-wife) Lea (Caterina Murino).  The different French police departments, meanwhile, stumble over each other trying to catch Ange, and the numerous Corsican separatist groups likewise compete for the honor of capturing the private eye who is poking his nose into their business.
  Love this movie!  One of the funniest things we have ever seen!",1373155200,2,1179,4.934010152284264
8183248,3,B000O76Q0M,"L'Enquete Corse aka The Corsican File is a disposable French action comedy that's light on the action and the comedy and whose sole distinction is tempting Jean Reno and Christian Clavier to team up again after their success with Les Visiteurs. Clavier's a Parisian private detective tricked into tracking down Reno's Corsican separatist, ostensibly to inform him of an inheritance. Most of the usual fish out of water culture clashes make their scheduled appearances without troubling the funny bone. What few laughs there are come at the expense of the local nationalist terrorist groups who are even more divided than the Judean People's Front and the local law enforcement networks who are just as obsessed with turf wars and internecine infighting. There is one funny sequence with one of the would-be Separatists buying tampons to use for fuses, but the film is far too formulaic to offer more, running out of steam long before the odd couple find themselves on the run. It's glossy and inoffensive enough and the scenery and Caterina Murano both look nice, but it's nothing you really need to see.",1353456000,,1104,5.005434782608695

The French PAL DVD offers a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with optional English and Corsican subtitles, though the plentiful extras - deleted scenes, outtakes, featurettes and interview with composer Alexandre Desplat - are all unsubtitled.",1284076800,,1348,5.155251141552512
8183250,4,B000O76Q0M,"The movie is about a detective from Paris who goes to Corsica and tries to find Ange Leoni, a big time Corsican separatist leader. The movie has action, romance, and comedy. All in all it is worth it to watch.",1265673600,3,209,4.25
8183251,3,B000O76Q0M,"Jean Reno excels at black comedy, ""Wasabi"" comes to mind. This film is over the top, a farce, with unexpected laughs around every corner. However, the film-to-DVD transfer is terrible: faded color and the subtitles are 50% illegible (yellow). When the background is light, it is impossible to read them. I wish someone would re-do the transfer, the film deserves better!",1242691200,5,370,5.081967213114754
