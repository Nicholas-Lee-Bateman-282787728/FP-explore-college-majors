3037841,5,B000Z6GT22,I simply love Elvis movies. Great to watch and bring happy memories! Hawaiian melodies are simply enticing. Elvis shines on this movie!,1241136000,,135,5.181818181818182
3037842,4,B000Z6GT22,"Blue Hawaii is classic and essential Elvis. Great beach party goofs with a great soundtrack.

Paradise, Hawaiian Style--on the other side of the ocean--is a really terrible knock-off of Blue Hawaii, which Elvis shouldn't have done.

The plot and the music are sub-standard when compared to Blue Hawaii, and for some strange reason Elvis's hair is visually died extra/extra black and super slick/greasy looking.

Anyway, this collection is worth buying for Blue Hawaii and it's reasonably priced, so just skip Paradise, unless you're a completist.",1222214400,3,546,5.4

3037844,5,B000Z6GT22,"This is an awesome DVD! Two of the best Elvis movies on one disc!!! And how can it get any better than Elvis in Hawaii? Blue Hawaii has been a favorite of mine since I was a child, it contains one of my favorite Elvis songs, Can't Help Falling in Love. If you love Elvis, you will love these movies!",1216857600,5,299,4.0
3037845,3,B000Z6GT22,"""Blue Hawaii"" is one of Elvis Presley's most popular films. The only reason I can come up with is that it includes the classic 'Can't Help Falling In Love', one of his best ballads. Otherwise, it's a mediocre film, the one that cemented the ""Elvis movie"" genre, and the first one Presley himself would loathe. But he plays along, and it's not nearly as bad as most of the musicals that would follow.
One of these is the next film here, ""Paradise Hawaiian Style"". Quite possibly the worst movie he ever made, with horrible songs, no story to speak of, bad camerawork, etc. etc. Elvis shows his disgust, not even bothering to pretend to be enjoying himself. What's more, Elvis is notably overweight and obviously out of it (not that anyone could blame him). It's sad to watch this movie and see the state of his career in 1966. Noone else could have survived a movie this horrendous.
But both of these films are here for a low price, so the Elvis devoted among us can add this set to their shelf without losing much money doing it.",1208736000,,1029,4.4787234042553195
3037846,5,B000Z6GT22,"If you love Elvis, can't get to Hawaii and want to escape to happier, sillier times, this DVD is the one.  Don't expect too much of a storyline for either movie, just sit back, enjoy the scenery and Elvis' dreamy voice and smile.",1206662400,11,229,4.325581395348837

3037860,5,B000Z6GT22,"No, this is not a double-sided disk as each movie is on its own disc. They are simply together in one box. Blue Hawaii stars Angela Landsbury as his doting mother, while Paradise Hawaiian Style co-stars James Shigeta whom I know from Flower Drum Song. The scenery is breathtaking in both, with plenty of palm, trees, blue skies, flowers, and Hawaiians. I liked the young girl in Paradise Hawaiian Style who belts out Bill Bailey though I am sure the voice was dubbed. Still, she was cute and very expressive. I liked the songs in both, especially the one at the end of Paradise Hawaiian Style with locals beating the drums that resound over the others at the ceremony. Harmless fun and nothing especially deep. Lots of color, laughs, and fun. And Elvis!",1373587200,3,753,4.669172932330827
