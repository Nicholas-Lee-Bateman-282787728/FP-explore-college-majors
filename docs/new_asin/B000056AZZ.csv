Judge which were stolen...will his partner Charles King let the return stand, or

can we count on fisticuffs with him and Steele which we so thoroughly enjoy...is

there a missing confession that would clear our hero, and what is Naomi's pet

monkey doing with the confession during this one hour Monogram gem...our heroine

Helen Foster puts romance in the life and times of Bob Steele, which will end

this adventure on a happy note and begin a new one. . . . . B-Western footnote,

Crabbe, Tex Ritter, The Rough Riders and Bob Steele...King appeared in 400 films

hate . . .second B-Western footnote.actor Lafe Mckee appeared in almost 400

films, began working in Hollywood in 1913 in numerous roles mostly in B-Westerns

in supporting roles with Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown, Gary Cooper, Hoot

Gibson, Buck Jones, Ken Maynard, Tim McCoy, Bob Steele, Tom Tyler and John Wayne

always as the elderly father of the heroine, a troubled businessman, ranch owner

losing his homestead or having his cattle rustled, whatever the case Lafe was

always in the thick of things. . . . third B-Western footnote, actor Earl Dwire,

one of the best western screen scoundrels of the '30s, was a snaky badmen and a

close friend to director Robert N. Bradbury, Dwire appeared in 17 Bob Steele

signature style performance...check out this and more in a new book ""Best of the
