8682897,5,B00OA73KGA,"Jack Benny is woderful in this rare television version of his infamous comedy. Jack reprises his role as an angel sent from heaven to destroy the world. This version is part of a 1950s series called Omnibus, which was hosted by a young Alistair Cooke. A nice piece of TV history.",1423526400,,279,4.490196078431373
