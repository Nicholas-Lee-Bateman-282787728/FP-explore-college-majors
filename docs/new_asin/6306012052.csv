1105588,4,6306012052,"Is Rules of Engagement a war film?  Yes and no.  It has all the elements of a war film but most of it takes place in a courtroom, which is symbolic of the road wars have taken over the years.  They've become an extension of politics by other means, so where better to set the first of it's kind.  It's the start of a new millenium and who better to turn our idea of what this movie should be about on it's ear than William Friedkin (of Exorcist fame).  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Colonel under investigation after a peacekeeping mission turned sour and he authorized his troops to open fire on Yemen 'civilans.'  We don't see what really happened right off the bat and are left to question if Jackson was right in his decision, the morality of which is left up to our judgement and it's a welcome change not to have an ethics lesson shoved down our throats.  Jones, an old war buddy, is enlisted to serve as his lawyer which he reluctantly excepts despite be vastly underqualified for the job.  Though both Jackson and Jones are at the top of their form their parts don't give them much of an opportunity to show off, leaving that distinction to Guy Pearce (another L.A. Confidential alum) and he's great.  This was maybe the suprise hit of the spring (along with Erin Brockovich) and deservedly so.  It has all the elements of a great film but a few missteps deprives Rules of that distinction.  But still it's one not to be missed.",971395200,,1435,4.3977272727272725

1105591,5,6306012052,"An excellant film! Why? Because it not only shows what men do under heavy fire, it also shows what they would really do. Not just have it sugar coated for the audience. Looking at the opening part of the movie, one can tell that it is Vietnam. Without words this sets the tone. You can just tell that a battle is going to happen. When it does the images are real. Later on in the film there is another battle taking place and this seems to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a Marine in charge of a rescue mission to save an American ambassador. When he orders his men to fire into a crowd containing men, women and children. Jackson is sent to trial. Tommy Lee Jones must some how prove that Jackson and his men had been fired upon from the crowd. A very real story centering around Marines, and a realistic view of war and every other day stuff helps give us a good view of men who risk there lives for others! Great sound and sound effects editing! Grade:B+",970358400,8,994,4.2368421052631575
1105592,5,6306012052,"Rules Of Engagement was one of the best movies of the year. Aside from the movies A+ sound and effects, it also showed the strugle the men and women  who protect this country are sometimes faced with for doing what they Have  to do. While most military men and women will never face situations nearly  as serious as this one, it defenitly shows the down side to too much  politics in the military. This movie also shows the elite brotherhood that  is shared in the Marine Corps, its like they say in the Corps, ""there  are soldies, and then there are Marines."" If your into War Movies,  Action movies, or you like a good drama this movie is for you, see it once,  see it twice, then see it again, you'll never growe board of this classic  film.",968025600,6,744,4.333333333333333
1105593,3,6306012052,"There is nothing that occurs in this film that any human being alive cannot predict after seeing the trailer for ""Rules of  Engagement."" Perhaps this is the one true example of how American  mainstream films have reached their lowest point in years. But saying that  would be too harsh. Sure, this is predictable. I think everyone who watches  this will know in their hearts that really this is a very average film.  Still, it has a certain bravado and entertainment factor to it which makes  it irresistable.
Basic plot: Samuel L. Jackson orders his marines to  start firing upon a bunch of civilians in Yemen. He is charged with murder  and Tommy Lee Jones must defend him. While ""Rules of Engagement""  sees Samuel L. Jackson shouting his guts out in every third scene and  attempts to gloss things over with a big question of military integrity,  the whole movie rests upon one question: Did Samuel L. Jackson fire upon  innocent people or were they armed? The marketing slogan that they have  come up for this crap is unbelievable, ""should a hero ever have to  stand alone?"" Throughout the film we are bombarded with questions of  ethics when in actuality it is a very simple question played out to full  dramatic effect. It turns out Samuel L. Jackson had every right to shoot at  those people because they DID have machine guns. That is the whole movie  summed up nicely in a paragraph.
Tommy Lee Jones is really good as is  Samuel L. Jackson. Their characters are an absolute joke and it's more of a  pleasure trying to watch them fumble around with such weak material. A  pleasure none the less.
Who am I to complain about violence in the  movies? I'm not going to take it seriously so as far as I'm concerned  ""Rules of Engagement"" does relieve a good days stress when the  massacre occurs. The violence is so gruesome that many will be repelled. It  doesn't bother me so the slaying of many inncoent people was also very  redeeming.
Ultimately ""Rules of Engagement"" is just another big  Hollywood joke that we all know is terrible but will still entertain us  anyway. If anyone can watch the final scene were Samuel L. Jackson salutes  an old Vietnamese soldier and not vomit all over their living room floor  I'll happily mail them fifty dollars.",967766400,4,2257,4.654822335025381
1105594,3,6306012052,"This movie is on my very short list for an Oscar nod - for best sound.  In the opening Vietnam sequence you could hear all the soldiers yelling and  screaming as the camera panned in a circle showing all that was going on.  This and other fine examples of the proper way to handle sound for a film  can be seen in this movie, granted you have a state of the art home theater  system or you saw ""Rules of Engagement"" in a modern theater with  SDDS, DTS, or THX.  There was some good performances (Guy Pearce, for one)  and some pretty good action sequences.  Worth a look.",967420800,7,571,4.212962962962963
1105595,3,6306012052,"Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent as usual in their roles:  two old friends from Vietnam whose careers took different courses  after a firefight that badly injured Jones.  Jackson's Marines rescue a  cowardly ambassador and his family from an embassy pelted with rocks,  insults and the occasional sniper's bullet.  In return for this service,  the ambassador will testify that Jackson lost control and opened fire on a  crowd full of unarmed civilians, because his superior at the Department of  State thinks he should to save the American reputation in the Middle  East.
The basic story is good and the actors have amazing presence, but  there are a number of amusing inconsistencies in the script, like:
1)  Dale Dye, as Samuel L. Jackson's commanding officer, asks him whether he  wants private counsel or the base legal office to represent him (if you  watch this in a theater full of military personnel, expect this line to be  among the funniest in the film).  This occurs right in the middle of him  briefing the man whose court-martial he will convene, which happens  absolutely never.
2) Why didn't anyone analyze the bullet holes in the  embassy wall to establish trajectory?
3) How the hell do you find a  Vietnamese company captain from an action that occurred thirty years ago  with no sort of attention at any previous time?  (This probably makes no  sense to you if you haven't seen it, and it really won't in the film,  except to make the point that even officers on opposing sides have the  common trait of valuing their troops' lives more than anything else on the  field of battle.)
The conflict between functions of state and defense  isn't as implausible as the reviewers appear to think, particularly in a  time when we deploy our soldiers and Marines to the world's least desirable  corners as beat cops.  Whether you set this story in Yemen or Kosovo or  somewhere else, it can happen, it has happened and will probably continue  to happen.  State wants its wars to resolve neatly into ends comfortably  discussed in meetings over tea, and gets annoyed when Defense reminds them  that rules of engagement always make room for an exception necessary for  saving lives.

1105885,2,6306012052,"I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. In the hands of any lesser actors, this movie would be a farce. There are more plot holes than in a block of Swiss cheese.  Other reviews have detailed some of them. Suffice it to say, when I finished watching this movie, I thought to myself ""this could never really happen for sooooo many reasons!""  It reminds me of one of the conspiracy theories spun by paranoids who fantasize endlessly about what did or didn't happen based on some button they sewed a vest on. This was a button of an idea and the writers/directors/producers sewed a large sized overcoat on it. It required too many people not to see things they would have seen, and too many people to lie for some unaccountable reasons that produced no benefit to anyone. Supposedly, the big lie is to protect the US from losing face and losing allies, but showing the truth would not have caused the feared outcome. Hiding the truth raised more questions about the US' responsibility, because who sends an irresponsible officer with a hair trigger temper and a history of killing ""innocent"" people, as they tried to portray Samuel Jackson's character,  into a volatile situation like that?  If this was true in the real world, there would be greater questions of culpability arising from that than from showing what actually happened.  And the forensics, people! A few pencils in those bullet holes with a picture taken would have settled the issue right there!  Rather than spoil it, I'll stop there. It's a big improbable mess!",1445904000,,1582,4.713768115942029
1105886,4,6306012052,"Released in 2000, Rules of Engagement is about two Marine officers, Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hodge (Tommy Lee Jones), who have a relationship going back to Vietnam. Childers is charged with murder after leading a team to the Yemen embassy to save the Ambassador and his family during a  violent demonstration (more like an all-out attack) and calls on Hodge to defend him. To save face, the National Security Advisor (Bruce Greenwood) wants Childers to be the scapegoat at all costs, disregarding blatant evidence to the contrary. Can Hodge, an alcoholic and mediocre lawyer at best, save his buddy who once saved his life? Guy Pierce plays the prosecutor while Ben Kingsley & Anne Archer play the Ambassador and his wife.

This is a war-drama by the maker of 1973s The Exorcist and 1977s Sorcerer similar in tone/plot to 1992s A Few Good Men. I like Rules better, despite some flaws (like being contrived). It may not have an iconic line like You cant handle the truth! but it has quality combat action (which A Few didn't have) and the story of the protagonists is just more compelling IMHO. The movies effectiveness hinges on Jackson and Jones convincing us of their characters, their relationship and their crisis, which they easily do. Some critics have decried the film as racist (naturally), but its more like telling the awful truth with 2012s infamous Benghazigate scandal lending support.  Director Friedkin said the movies not anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and certainly not anti-Yemen, its anti-terrorist. Bear in mind that the King of Morocco had to read and approve the script before the filmmakers could use Morocco for locations and nobody participating from the Arab side of things felt the film was anti-Arab.

One critic complained about a peripheral character not resurfacing at the end, but why pan a story for NOT being predictable?

The blurb at the end makes it seem like the movie was based on a true story, but it's not. It simply reveals what happens to the characters after the story ends so the viewers aren't left in the air.

The movie runs 128 minutes and was shot in Morocco (substituting for Yemen), South Carolina (Vietnam), Virginia and Washington DC.

Some who have been, want to rate this movie one or two stars because of the inaccuracies of the real life military and courtrooms.  That's fine, they are entitled to their opinions.  I watch a movie for the entertainment value. Occasionally a red flag will go up for something very obviously wrong in the filming as it did with the number of marines lost in that battle.  Several of the characters state that 3 marines lost lives in the battle.  There were at least a dozen marines ""under cover on the wall"" until they opened fire on the crowd.  That is more than 3.  Col Childers said all his witnesses were dead.  Capt. Lee testified that he didn't remember if the crowd had weapons or not, but I would think he and the other marines would have seen weapons when they opened fire on the crowd. IDK, maybe I'm missing something here, but it doesn't ""compute"".  I know the movie is fictitious, but if it were real, the NSA would have been fired for withholding information AND perjury,  instead of allowed to resign and draw gov. money.

1105948,4,6306012052,"Courtroom dramas have long been a staple in cinema. As in all genres, some are better than others. his outing is pretty good.

Here's the scoop. Military lawyer Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) is recruited by fellow officer, Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel Jackson) to defend him in a court martial hearing where he is accused of firing on an unarmed crowd during a rescue mission at a U.S. Embassy in Yemen. Can Hodges put down the bottle and save the day?

This is a pretty good outing as these things go. You have a good cast. Add to the above Guy Pearce (sporting a weird New York accent) Bruce Greenwood, Ben Kingsley et al insures deft handling of the script. The back and forth between the prosecution and defense is generally decent. What brings it down a bit is the directing. William Friedkin, in his earlier efforts, showed excellent directing skills and a lot of visual flare. This is a more pedestrian outing. Not bad, just not notable. One heightened cross examination near the end almost looks a bit silly with its intense close-ups. Also is the end. As this is taken from an actual event, it seems the writers might have stuck closely to what actually happened. There is no huge climax with a last second revelation that seals the deal. Both sides deliver their closing arguments and the jury decides. It's all quite low keyed.

This is a decent outing. Maybe not the best of this genre you'll ever see but imminently watchable nonetheless. If court room dramas are your poison, have at it.",1426032000,,1512,4.655430711610487

From the viewpoint of the concepts (of the military problem) involved, the collection of material and evidence for the trial by the attorney (Tommy Lee Jones) who made it his business to do this by going to the scene of the ""crime"" in Yemen, the implications of the ""rules of engagement"" involved in this immensely complicated situation, and the drama of a brilliantly successful marine who faced loss of all credentials, career, and credence if found guilty of breach of the ""rules of engagement"" and indeed the relevance of ""rules of engagement"" and their interpretation, this film was riveting and of enormous consequence in the management of such a complex situation. It was one of the most important, and serious, films I have ever seen. And yet to me it flew by and I had not one moment of restlessness or boredom.

1106201,2,6306012052,"Rules of Engagement (William Friedkin, 2000)
[originally posted 8May2000]

Two bad Samuel L. Jackson movies in one year? Say it ain't so, Jim! But the sad truth is, yep. On the heels of allowing himself to be cast in Star Wars: Episode I, Jackson finds himself in this muddled mess of a Friedkin. You know, one wonders what drives Friedkin these days, and how someone whose career started with such promising work as The Birthday Party, The French Connection, and The Exorcist took such a left turn so quickly, leaving us with stuff like Blue Chips, Jade, and Rules of Engagement.

And Jackson isn't the only one who lent his name to this muddled mess, though he's the actor I'm most surprised to find in a bad film. Tommy Lee Jones, Ben Kingsley, Dale Dye, and Blair Underwood all find themselves in here, wandering aimlessly through a plot with more holes in it than the facade of the building in question, but they've all been in truly awful things before.

The quick and easy plot summary is this: Jackson is a marine colonel who saved Jones' life when both were in Vietnam. Jones got shot up and took a desk job as a not-too-good lawyer, while Jackson stayed in the field. Jackson is sent to evacuate the ambassador to Yemen and protect the embassy, and while doing so, Jackson and his men are attacked, from the time they're still in the air until the time Jackson orders his men to open fire on the crowd. And they do, killing eighty-three people. The Yemeni government is up in arms (pardon the pun) over this, and Jackson is hauled in front of a military tribunal as a scapegoat. He hires Jones to defend him, and away we go.

If you want to make a good Vietnam war film, you go to the best. You get Jim Webb to write the script. Webb's good, right? He wrote the definitive Vietnam War novel, Fields of Fire. Then you get a technical adviser who happens to double as an actor whose name, in Hollywood, is synonymous with Vietnam--Dale Dye. Whip up a few upper-middle-age actors, and transport the whole thing to the year 2000.

Whoops. Rules of Engagement is not a Vietnam War film, despite that fact that a decent chunk of its screen time takes place there. And maybe that's where this thing goes horribly wrong. Well, that, and the incredible number of clich&eacute;s in the script. Let's see. We need a scene where Jones and Jackson beat each other to a pulp and end up laughing about it. We need a scene where a whole bunch of people get shot up in Vietnam. We need a slimy government official who is the embodiment of pure evil. We need a young, gung-ho prosecutor who will make a name for himself with this case (Guy Pearce, last seen as the male lead in Ravenous, who is nastily effective here). And so on, and so on. You name it, it's in here. How much predictability do you want?

Okay, despite all this, there ARE some good things to be said. There's a chemistry between Jones and Jackson. Jackson's usual comic timing comes through, despite the script (you get the feeling he ad-libbed a lot). Pearce and the evil government official (Bruce Greenwood, who hasn't played a good guy since FOX's late and very much lamented series Nowhere Man) are very, very good at making you hate them. And at a time when American feeling towards the government and our military and its involvement overseas is either horribly wrong or right but for all the wrong reasons, it can be argued that a film like this was in desperate need of being made. It's too bad that what came out of it was such a cliche-ridden, goopy, insubstantial mess. Many reviewers have compared it to A Few Good Men, one of whom went so far as to say Rules of Engagement is ""the same movie. Not similar, the same."" Would that it were so. After this, Jack Nicholson's scene-chewing and Tom Cruise's incompetence look positively masterful. * ",1376870400,,3817,4.523188405797101

A forced attempt to cram an evil mastermind into the fray disagrees with the otherwise-universal theme that there is no black and white picture in a situation as difficult and politically charged as this one, and that's not the only scene that should have been shown the cutting room floor. Despite a few heated exchanges between Jones and the prosecuting attorney (a fiery turn by Guy Pearce), it's a great load of topical potential that never amounts to more than a weak fizzle and a sudden, puzzling jury decision.",1330905600,,984,4.628571428571429
1106394,5,6306012052,"With a screenplay written by a true War Hero and public servant, Sen Jim Webb, former SecNav, Navy Cross awardee, award winning author, its premise and action describe all too well the challenges of serving in the military of a democracy.  Although the story is fictional, it is all too close to the reality servicemen have experienced since Korea.  A society and its politicians who are more focused on not losing rather than at winning at war, an ignorant nation that is too quick to blame its military caught in the vice of knowing how to win in the most terrible of human endeavors -- war -- and trying to please the too many in society that have refused to and will never take up such a burden.  Childers playing a MEU (SOC) commander [look it up] is representative of a Marine commander who has been out there, on patrol in defense of this nation for decades.  The rescue of the Mayaguez, Grenada, Beirut, Liberia, Bosnia, Kosovo, the War on Terror,  -- are all examples of the quick slope down which a peacetime commander will have to slide when an unexpected threat to American interests arises.  Childers responds as anyone might in his position.  Focus on the mission, minimize casualties AMONG YOUR OWN and get out quickly.  Unfortunately he then must face the Monday morning, arm chair quarterbacking that too often follows after the danger passes and those who do not suffer the burden of command have the luxury of commenting on and judging it -- his actions.  This is a must see for those who truly want to ""support the troops"" by at least trying to gain some understanding of the ironies of their command situation and the true love these real heroes have for their nation.",1326585600,,1689,4.640939597315437

There are flaws, as pointed out by several other reviewers, such as the commanding officer (Played by combat coach Dale Dye) lecturing Jackson on his coming court martial. That is called ""command influence"" and is a big no-no. The combat scenes are excellent and even the courtroom scenes are good. The improbability of finding the right NVA colonel 30 years later to testify in a US court martial is secondary to the dramatic effect. Both Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones are terrific and two of my favorites.

The movie was made before 9/11 but is more honest about Islamic violence than anything made since. If you look closely, in a final scene, even the little girl who has lost her leg is seen firing a gun at the Marines. You probably will notice that the tenth time or so you watch the movie. I did.

The most unbelievable aspect of the whole film is the fact that Jim Webb wrote the story, then ran for the Senate as a Democrat.

Our two lead characters fought together during Viet Nam and experienced extreme action.

His mission encounters heavy automatic weapon fire as they touch-down in the embassy compound. Extracting the Ambassador and his family, fire become heavier killing and wounding several Marines. Jackson eventually orders his troops to return fire killing over 80 people outside of the embassy. The key question was, were these people armed and firing upon the embassy? If so, they were combatants; if not they were civilians. The movie shifts to a legal and courtmarshall drama. Jackson asks his old friend Jones to be his attorney.

The Marines fire on the crowd and it creates a firestorm in the press and the State Department with everyone trying to save their careers by sacrificing the Colonel.

Even more interesting to me is what this movie portrays almost exactly a year prior to 9/11.  Although very relevant post 9/11, I suspect that nobody would touch this script with a 10-ft. pole today.

One of the stronger images in the movie, also more relevant today than when it was released, is when the Colonel leaves the courthouse after the verdict and is verbally attacked by the media and public but saluted by his former enemy, the North Vietnamese Colonel.

The opening scene sets his attitude pretty well when he blatantly kills a Viet Cong prisoner to encourage the enemy commander to call off his unit which is killing everyone in Tommy Lee Jones's platoon. While the plot is different, the atmosphere of old, beat-down, used-up has-beens reminds me of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. The problem lies in the ending.

I think it could have been a good movie, but it lacked a key ingredient. I lost that suspension of disbelief that makes it necessary to enjoy the movie. I will illustrate this point next, but beware...

SPOILER AHEAD...

When the old Viet Cong commander who stopped the attack on Tommy Lee Jones's platoon shows up in the court room to testify, I was stricken with how unlikely that would be. When he testified that Samuel L. Jackson murdered his radio operator to force him to call off the attack, I figured it was a done deal. Regardless of all the emotion brought forth by Tommy Lee Jones's defense, which sounded good, but didn't change the facts, the whole time I'm watching this I'm thinking ""guilty, guilty, guilty."" I was sure they weren't going to convict the main character, I was just wondering how he was going to get out of it. The ultimate defense was Tommy Lee Jones asking the Viet Cong commander if he would have done the same if that had been his friend's platoon being killed. Of course, the guy says ""yes."" So the viewer is supposed to believe that makes it ok? Since when did the American military hold the values of the Viet Cong up to such high admiration that they condoned flat-out murder, point-blank, in the head, to an unarmed prisoner?

In the last analysis, it's a cynical and manipulative film, not least because the final captions suggest it is a true story -- and I see from some basic internet research that it is not.

Also, it mericilessly milks a number of stereotypes: some of them concern the Yemeni characters; others Vietnam; the relationship between the black and white characters; the main characters' relationships with their families (the lawyer with his overshadowing father, estranged wife, and pacifist son; the colonel Childers with the Marine Corps, the flag, and his non-existent family). Finally, this is a gripping film that does not do justice to its underlying themes, which include a racial aspect that goes entirely unexplored.

Today -- July 22, 2006 -- there are desperate issues in the world that could have been illuminated by a film like this one. They are not, which may explain why Secretary of the Navy James Webb, who reportedly originally worked on the concept, ultimately withdrew. These are questions -- when does war become murder? what counts as torture? what as innocence? how complicit must civilian populations be before they become targets themselves? -- that are too important to be left to films as un-self-conscious as this one.",1153526400,2,1425,4.904564315352697
1106549,2,6306012052,"On the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama.

Underneath, however, the director seems to have a couple of other themes going. One thing that stood out to me is that the film is full of people who are ""caught between a rock and a hard place"". Right from the start, where Childers has to choose between following the rules of war or saving his best friend. He has a similar choice on the wall in Yemin - fire into the crowd or let the attack on his people continue. I think he knew at that moment that his career was in the crapper. Jones' character said as much during the trial: ""Whatever happens here, this man will never command marines again"". The ""bad guy"" national security advisor was in a bind: do what is best for America's interests or back up the colonel? The ambassador had to make a hard choice: lie on the stand or lose his job, his status, his reputation? Even his wife had to decide whether to tell the truth or stand behind her husband's story. Biggs, the prosecutor, got caught up in it - he started out with the intent to prosecute what he was convinced was a legitimate case, then got tossed a 'hot potato' by the NSA right in open court. Childers' second-in-command, Captain Lee, had to decide whether to tell the truth or back his colonel. And so on.

The court-martial itself seems to pit logic against emotion (shades of Star Trek!). The differences are clearest in the closing arguements - Biggs is the Joe Friday ""just the facts"" type; he presents the panel with A. this happened, then B this happened, and so on.  Hayes' whole arguement is based on emotion - and then, finally, the jury is left with yet another hard decision.

Finally for the first time in a long time, someone in hollywood steps out on a limb and shows the public a realistic protrayal of urban warfare against terrorist.

When terrorist start shooting from the ensueing riot below, the Marines on the wall are being engaged, and all of a sudden, one is shot... 2... 3... The ranking marine orders the people to stop shooting over the loud speaker, then he warns them... Then he shoots them as another soldier dies.

He's a hero to his men, he saved their lives, he's a hero to the people on the home front [veterans] who know he did what had to be done... but then he is courtmarshaled, and so begins the drawn out trial of his innocence or guilt.

An exelent movie for the year 2000, and even more exelent is the acting done by Tommy lee Jones, and of course Samuel L Jaskson.

The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.

In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!!  Strongly recommended along with Black Hawk Down, A Few Good Men, and Courage Under Fire.",1138147200,4,1106,4.909090909090909
1106622,3,6306012052,"This is one of the most engaging and well-made action movies I ever watched, it conveys a powerful feeling of actuality, and shall leave you biting at your own nails during most of the viewing time. Acting is very good, special effects are realistic and compelling, and the DVD's audio and video quality is above average.

All this said, potential buyers should keep in their minds that, like most American productions, this movie shouldn't be considered anything above an action buster and a legal thriller. Most of all it must not be regarded as anything seriously concerned with military and political actuality, and the legal issues connected to it. This is a fiction as unconcerned in portraying the behavior of the American military or the issues at stake during rescue operations in urban areas, as ""Saving private Ryan"" was unconcerned in seriously depicting World War II fighting.

First off the plot, while admittedly retaining an appearance of balance and realism during most of the movie, is spoiled by the final revelation. The idea that 80+ % of the individuals composing so large a crowd could be armed and firing en masse from an open courtyard devoid of any cover is as ludicrous as the idea that so big a show could go unnoticed and unreported... where are the policy chains set up to keep things under control? Where are the reporters rushing to get the big scoop? Where are the crowds massing at distance to see what's happening? Where is the embassy staff? Has the ambassador been left alone with his family and a couple aids?!?

Most of all the movie makers, in their effort to please the patriotic feelings of American viewers, strive to convey the false impression that US military and political institutions care a great deal about civil casualties. As the Iraqi torture and bombardment scandals have amply shown, the US military cares little more than Al-Qaida about the loss of innocent human life, and American politicians are primarily concerned in covering up their troops' behavior. In cases (like the Abu Grahib events) where a scandal can not be suppressed, a scapegoat is quickly found and a few grunts dismissed or sentenced to short terms.

Remember My Lai? For the murder of 350 villagers, only one person was sentenced, and then the great humanitarian, Richard M. Nixon, granted pardon and commuted the sentence to 10 years. Then in Sept. 1974, a federal district court overturned the conviction and Lt Calley was released! The other killers got no sentence at all, and it took 30 years for the few soldiers who defended the villagers to get medals from Congress. I don't write this out of outrage - I am as obdurate to human rights issues as the troopers concerned - but out of scorn toward the human inclination to warp reality in order to create the myths and ideologies that make organized society possible.

This is one of the many war productions aimed to mytologize history (well, in this case actuality) to fit into the American civic religion of Christian morality, brave patriotism and stalwart citizen-soldiery. WWII movies like ""Saving private Ryan"" are an appropriate term of comparison: in showing GIs engaged in desperate stands and heroic fights they mold the herd's minds into believing that the American military accomplished a lot more than slowly and inefficiently toppling an already defeated enemy (mauled by Soviet human waves on the Eastern front) by levelling any pocket of resistance through fighter-bombers and artillery. (On this point I recommend John Ellis' ""Brute Force. Allied Strategy and Tactics in the II World War"")

Instead of confronting us with a borderline situation, and outlining the balance of political and legal issues arising when the military must come to terms with heavy loss of human life coupled with the inability to divert mass medias' attention, the movie makers choosed to go for a conventional war movie and legal thriller, packed with the usual, nauseous stereotypes: the gallant, unjustly persecuted hero (the Colonel), the stealthy villain (the US defence counsellor) and the honest citizen (the Colonel's attorney) striving to overcome his personal problems to ensure that justice is finally done. Nor they forgot the insufferable Happy End of standard Hollywood filmography.

Now don't get me wrong, this is an excellent thriller and war movie, and you'll love it as long as you are into the genre and satisfy yourself with mainstream productions - that's why I am giving it three stars. Just don't make the mistake to go to the box office if you are looking for anything concerned with real-world actuality, or stimulating from an intellectual point of view.",1133654400,2,4658,5.002580645161291

1106628,4,6306012052,"The personal responsibility of a soldier of any rank from any country in any military action  is a real problem. This film tackles this problem under the light of a potential miscarriage of military justice in the US. It all revolves around one piece of evidence, a video tape, that was destroyed but had been duly listed on some invoice slip. The court does not require this piece of evidence but the jury seems to have taken it into account to refuse to convict the accused of the crime the politicians of the State Department and the leadership of the Marines would like him to be convicted of. Unluckily the film is cryptic about this element that seems to be supported by some written messages at the end of the film showing the national security advisor who destroyed the tape was gotten rid of. But the film does not make this piece of information the center of the plot, though it deserves to be. But yet the film is quite clear about how a miscarriage of military justice is built and planned to cover the failings and shortcomings and drawbacks of other personnel like diplomatic staff or ambassadors or counselors or advisors of any type. You have to destroy a piece of evidence, then you have to pressurize the officers who have authority in the case, and then you make some people lie, bluntly lie, and there you are. It's ugly, frightening and disgusting and yet it happens all the time. In this film to cover up the political mess the soldier has to be convicted of a crime he did not commit, in some other cases it can be the reverse, to be absolved of a crime he did commit on orders but those orders have to be covered up for political reasons. Politics is the worst human invention ever and it is too often the cause of the worst crimes imaginable. And war is generally the result of the impotence of politicians, their incapability to solve problems without violence. And soldiers have always been pawns on the political chessboard. They better be willing to die on the altar of politics if they enter this career. But at times there might be salvation and success for one victim of such events, though it will be the exception that will prove the rule unescapable : soldiers are the natural scapegoats and fuses of politicians.

1106629,5,6306012052,"I watched this film when it was released in VHS years ago, but it is still a great film.  I've read a few bad reviews about this movie, where people claim it to be propaganda in order to better the U.S' position in the world, but it isn't.

Dealing with the issue of Childers murdering those Yemenis, to tell the truth, I understand protests, but they were blazingly violent.  They were grabbing guards and beating the crap out of them.  A mother had her child in her arms while standing next to a sniper on a rooftop, and shielded his ears while he was firing (which reminds me of the protestors at the Terri Schiavo 2-week death period, where they brought their kids, only to have them arrested).  The fact that the crowd had guns was just the ""cherry on top"" for a good excuse for Childers to solve the problem permanently.  That embassy was U.S soil, and snipers (and the crowd) were firing at it, killing Marines, throwing firebombs, rocks, pretty much they signed their death warrants when they got violent.

It was U.S soil, though, and Childers had every right to kill anyone attacking it.  Right now in Uzbekistan, for example, they are going through a type of civil war.  It started with VIOLENT protests against the government for wrongfully imprisoning their comrades.  If they had protested peacefully, their murders would incite a cry of mass slaughter.  However, they were attacking government soldiers, so the soldiers have a right to defend themselves.

To have your hands tied behind your back, carrying a loaded rifle, while the possibility of instant death or torture is looming in your face, and you cannot fire because you fear the legal and sociopolitical consequences of your actions - is just plain nuts...and I am not supporting Florida's ""Wild-West"" gun law by saying that.

That being said, the film is an inspiration for doing the right thing.  It defends truth, justice, and fairness.  Whether you are a ""bleeding heart Liberal"" or a staunch anti-American from another country, you will love this film because, even though it is fiction, it does represent today's justice system and how difficult it can be to reach truth.

1106630,5,6306012052,"Putting political issues out of the picture, I found RULES OF ENGAGEMENT a fascinating film experience.  Oscar winning director William Friedkin gives us an opening scene in Vietnam which is disturbing in its violence and intensity.  And then he takes us to Yemen, where a supposedly peaceful demonstration gets out of hand and over 80 ""innocent"" women and children are slaughtered, the order given by decorated Colonel Terry Childers.  As the viewers can attest, the demonstration is far from peaceful and Childers' decision utilizing the rules of engagement is a logical, if tragic, one.  What makes the movie such a powerful entity is the magnificent performances of Samuel L. Jackson (probably one of his best performances) as Childers and gruff Tommy Lee Jones as the lawyer who defends him against the murder charges.  Both actors seize their roles with a marked intensity and are fascinating to watch as they embody their characters with the valor, doubt, and fierce belief in themselves.  Guy Pearce (Memento, Count of Monte Cristo) is excellent as Biggs, the soldier who serves as the prosecutor.  The rest of the supporting cast is good too:  Bruce Greenwood, Philip Baker Hall, Ben Kingsley, Anne Archer and Nicky Katt.  I would think it would be hard to decide what to do in a case like this, and seeing how duplicitous and deceitful the government is once again portrayed, it would be hard call.

The movie events are timely ... terrorism in Yemen, court martial. Samuel L. Jackson as the accused Col. Terry Childers, is excellent, as is the prosecuting attorney.  The trial itself is my favorite part.  Tommy Lee as Col. Hayes Hodges belies his claim to be a poor lawyer by turning in a quite credible performance.

There are some inconsistencies in the script (how come none of the Marines saw the crowd below firing at them when they fired back? .... their testimony would have cleared Childers immediately.)  But the best part of the movie consists in the heart-felt and lasting friendship between Hayes and Terry.  And the most touching is when, after the trial as Childers leaves the courtroom, he sees a North Vietnamese officer who testified against  him.

Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are both excellent as veteran Marine soldiers fighting the battle of their reputations. Incidents occur in Yemen that unfortunately result in civilian deaths.

William Friedkin directs this film with an easy hand, allowing the actors to carry the movie rather than a bunch of guts and glory. Although it was released in 2000 the events are very much related to today. Consider the court marshalls currently taking place against our soldiers in Iraq.

A security detail from a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) is called in to defuse the situation.  From that point onward, utter chaos breaks out.
In this day & age the scene of the mob is sure to be quite gripping to any American viewer.  This is especially the case given the fact that we've had several embassies overseas bombed in the past 10-20 years.  Ever since 9/11 it has been exceedingly difficult to have a whole lot of sympathy for anti-American mobs, regardless of where they are.
While the film examines nicely some of the ethical intricacies of combat, the major flaw is that there is a rather large hole in the plot that even the least clever moviegoers will be able to point out.  As the rest of the movie is pretty good, the best thing to do is to try and overlook this unfortunate inconsistency.
Another facet that strikes close to home is the cover-up attempts of the State Department.  Not only is this plausible, but it is downright realistic.  Few people with morals work for the State Department and the history of the department is filled with cloak-and-daggar silliness.
In all, this is an entertaining movie that compels one to think.  It would have been a great movie, if not for the hole in the plot.

Moreover, the courtroom scenes are ridiculous as they in no way resemble the procedure of an actual courtmartial.  Improper argument during opening statements, questioning an ambassador as to how he would give orders to troops if he were a military commander, constant cussing during testimony etc.  It would never happen.

Well, I guess I was wrong about that. In just a few years, we're at war with practically the whole Islamic world.
So why doesn't ""Rules of Engagement"" hold up today?
Well, it isn't a very good movie. I was disappointed because Friedkin is one of my favorite directors of all time. Nothing was really thought out. For example...
Who thought a 50 year old Tommy Lee could pass for a 20 something year old just by putting a hat on him? Please. They could have hired younger actors to play the younger versions of Lee and Jackson's characters!
If all those people in the crowd had guns, why didn't we see any in the beginning?
Why didn't the Marines focus on the snipers in the adjacent towers? Surely, they were a more viable target than a few shooters in the crowd down below.
Why was the State Department guy SO concerned about our ties to the Arabs?

1106700,4,6306012052,"This is a powerful movie that closely examines the problem faced by every trial lawyer: how do you bring the reality of what really happened into a courtroom.  Facts appear different in court.  And of course often one side does everything it can, and more than it should, to distort ""objective truth"" to the extent that it exists.  That is what this movie is about.

The movie deals with a combat marine (Samuel L. Jackson) who rescues the staff of the besieged American embassy in Yemen.  Things get ugly and people die.  Was he a trigger-happy war criminal, or was he doing his duty in a damnable situation?  That is the question that the movie examines.  Tommy Lee Jones is very good as the defense attorney, and Jackson does his customary excellent job.

The premise is unfortunately very believable.  There are many technical defects in the court-martial that will offend any trial lawyers watching the movie (during opening and closing Jones makes many personal references to himself and his personal knowledge of the defendant, for example).  But put these defects aside.  The real issue here is how to bring reality into the courtroom in the face of a determined attempt by the government to deceive and obfuscate.

The DVD is of very high quality, both audio and video.  It is a pleasure to watch.

I am not a huge Tommy Lee Jones fan, but he was pretty darned good in this movie.  Samuel L. Jackson is very authentic and reminds us that there are tough, good soldiers and marines out there putting their lives on the line to protect us.  Recommended without reservation.

1106776,2,6306012052,"Perhaps once upon a time there was a script that dealt seriously with the issues of morality and warfare in the ambiguous post-modern warfare of ""low-intensity"" conflict. That's my hope. The resulting RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, however, takes every good element it has and obscures it behind trite dramatics and sad appeals to the successful devices of past ""legal"" films. It's pretty obvious that a couple of bufoon film executives were given an all too free ride in the finalization of the screenplay.
The two combat scenes are excellent: Vietnam in the 1960s; and Yemen in the 1990s. Reviewers who know what they're talking about have commented on all that, but I'll just say they are the high points of the film. The two battle scenes do a remarkable job of relaying the stress and confusion of the American characters under fire.
The rest of the film, however, is utterly useless. Why? Because of the potential that was squandered. A FEW GOOD MEN, which is uncomfortably aped by this movie, was successful in presenting ambiguous moral questions about the use of power in the military, and its relationship to the free society the military protects. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT had the potential to provoke those kinds of questions, but the weaknesses overwhelm it.
Two Marines who fought together in Vietnam are reunited in the 1990s. A public relations disaster and coverup erupts when US Marines protecting and evacuating the embassy in Yemen begin to take casualties. The one Marine (Sam Jackson) is the commander of the force evacuating the embassy. He orders his troops to fire into the crowd, killing scores of Yemenis. The other Marine (Tommy Lee J.) is a washed up ex-drunk with a knack for losing cases, and ends up defending the Sam in a shockingly anti-climactic court martial. Sam, you see, has been hung out to dry by the Goviment, and the drying out Tommy can't get over the fact he's not as cool as his Marine dad.
Bravado, sanctimony, and hyperbole flow freely, but we've seen all that before. Frankly, I don't think there's an actor today who can portray an avenging lawyer as well as Michael Moriarty on old LAW & ORDER reruns. You can guess the outcome unless you've been living in a bomb shelter for a couple of decades. These children of Perry Mason can do no wrong, for God is on their side, etcetera, etcetera.
What could have gone right?
1) The civilian sleazeball villain could have been scaled back. It was perfect at first: the man was acting on his political instincts of the interests of the United States and the security of Americans everywhere. He outlines all of the alternative options available to Sam instead of blowing away the protestors. The viewer starts to think, ""Well geez, maybe he's kinda right."" This ambiguity is so important in trying to figure out these very real issues in the real world. But then it is all layed on so thick that the viewer is not left with any choice about who the bad guy is when the character is played as grotesquely as possible.
2) The chaos and confusion of events at the embassy. This was all very interesting; the breakdown in communication, the stress, etc. What overshadowed this, however, was the utter stupidity of a US Ambassador actually having his family with him in such an obviously hostile post.
3) The vanity and near hysteria of Sam Jackson's character was often chilling. We are initially left with severely mixed feelings as we watch the court martial plot unfold. However, they decided to give you a flashback to make you feel alright about having him your hero. Again, this removes the ambiguity.
4) Tommy Lee's defense case was pretty sappy. Apart from an okay, sob-story closing argument, it is perplexing to see why the verdict was so magnaminous. In reality, with the range of choices available to the commander at the time, he should have been nailed to the wall by the jury. One Marine death came from the crowd; the rest from the more deadly sniper fire. Did the commander then not have a greater obligation to suppress the sniper fire? Doing so would probably have caused the crowd to scatter anyway, and all of the women and children would not have died.
5) A decent lawyer with even half the story could have nailed the Ambassador for perjury right there on the stand. The helicopters were taking fire as they were landing, there were dozens of American witnesses about the danger of the situation. Tommy Lee could have skewered him for blatantly lying.
6) Since when does mail to the State Department go to the National Security Adviser? The unrealistic chain of command undermines the screenplay even more.
7) Colonel Sam and the Vietnamese commander saluting each other. This was the most poignant part of the film. It was the ultimate challenge to the viewer: honor, dignity, and common understanding was based on a mutual recognition of the moral insanity and absurdity of the violence. The nature of moral responsibility is that much more confusing.
This should have ended the movie, with lots of open questions left about what really happened, and about what values really mattered in judging these events. Instead, the appeal to the banal was made, with a bunch of silly text messages assuring the viewer that all the hitherto unaccountable badguys were indeed busted. Why? It was totally disatisfying; the point of such a resolution is that the audience participates in it. It's silly to think some text paragraphs overlaying marching soldiers lets us feel justice was done. Had they left it open ended, they might have been able to salvage this movie as one provoking serious questions about the nature of bad policies and bad decisions in the inconclusive world of post-modern combat.",1016409600,3,5689,4.823950870010235

While I found this movie to be entertaining, I don't know that I'll watch it again except to discuss it with my 15 year old son in order to get his take on some of the issues covered in the movie. The issues of patriotism, defending those who depend on you, doing the right thing and how to get out of things that are over your head, are important issues that are addressed in this movie, they're just not addressed that well.
It doesn't take an avid JAG viewer (not that I am one nor am I an attorney) to realize that if the movie shows you what happened and why, but there is no corroborating evidence and there are prosecution witnesses who are lying, then you discredit the ""bad guys'"" testimony. This should have been of prime benefit to the defense, but doesn't happen here.
This movie reminds me of a theme I find in many other movies as well as books. The management characters only care about their careers and are willing to step on the backs of the hump characters to whom they owe unpaid gratitude for the efforts that management takes credit for. Cynical yes, accurate, probably, overdone definitely. It's an unfair world, let's get over it and produce works that shed more understanding on those characteristics in the human condition and human spirit from which we can benefit. I see no reason to constantly remind ourselves how unfair life can be.
The acting was quite good given the lack of depth the actual characters are forced to portray in this movie. The actions of all the bad guys are predictable and so are those of the good guys.
The burning question, on which the justification for the accused's actions hang, is whether or not there was gunfire from the crowd on the street. It seems to me analysis of the bullet holes in the soft masonry walls of the embassy would indicate trajectory and therefore prove or disprove the accused's claims. If you stick your finger in a bullet hole in the wall and your finger is pointing up at an angle not horizontally, and there are a substantial number of those holes, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to solve that mystery. A second question is why the ambassador was not required to prove he was the one to remove the American flag when he evacuated the embassy as he said he did.
The ending was anticlimatic and therefore a let down and the epilogue on the screen explaining the fate of the bad guys seemed more like a lame afterthought than it was helpful. Had it been a true story, I might have been interested, as it was just pleasant fiction, I could care less.

1106873,3,6306012052,"***1/2  Had William Friedken's `Rules of Engagement' had the courage to travel down a different route, it might have emerged as a great film rather than merely the good one it turns out to be. Credit this big budget action film with at least attempting to address a morally complex issue in a morally complex way. That the film doesn't succeed completely is probably due to the restraints imposed on it by both studio and box office considerations.
The film poses a number of long-debated military questions: when used in the context of an endeavor like war - whose primary aim is to take away the lives of one's enemy - is the term ""rules of engagement"" itself an untenable paradox? Does it even makes sense to have ""rules"" when it comes to war? And can there be such a thing as an `innocent victim' killed in the heat of battle? And can a commander who orders the deaths of such people in a wartime situation be convicted of `murder'?
Samuel L. Jackson stars as Colonel Terry Childers, a decorated Vietnam War hero who suddenly finds himself on trial for court martial for ordering his men to open fire on an allegedly unarmed group of Islamic protesters demonstrating outside the United States embassy in Yemen. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Hays Hodges, the man whom Childers saved in a battle in Vietnam who now, as a self-described mediocre lawyer, has the chance to pay back his buddy by clearing his name in court. `Rules of Engagement' raises a number of fascinating issues, but I contend that the film would have been even more interesting than it is (and it IS interesting) if it had left the audience in doubt as to Childers' innocence or guilt. Instead, we know from the beginning that Childers' version of the events in question is the accurate one, which robs the film of the kind of gripping human drama that can be achieved only through an examination of the ambiguities that make up human motives and actions. This means that we know who the heroes and villains are right away. There is even a tell-all video of the event to be secreted and ultimately destroyed by an unctuous government official. Thus, we end up with yet another David vs. Goliath story, yet another soldier-at-the-mercy-of-the-U.S.-military-industrial-complex scenario, when what we really crave is something more challenging, more ambiguous, more morally complex.
These elements are what keep `Rules of Engagement' from being an extraordinary achievement. Yet, there are many positive aspects of the film as well. For one thing, it avoids the temptation to become a xenophobic, flag-waving pro-American/anti-Islamic diatribe. It certainly doesn't shy away from portraying the tragic toll inflicted by the shooting on the protestors present. In addition, it allows its two male leads to display honest emotions like regret, confusion and self-doubt. They are even permitted to cry from time to time. In a way, both actors have been cast a bit against type, since neither is portraying the self-assured, almost cocky brand of hero he is usually called on to play.
Most important is that, despite the feeling of compromise, the film does raise some fascinating moral issues that too few major films even bother to consider. If this review comes across as more negative than it should, it is merely because the potential for greatness is always regrettable when it is not achieved. Nevertheless, `Rules of Engagement' deserves to be seen and admired for what did make it to the screen. For all its imperfections, this really is a very good film.",986688000,3,3527,4.888146911519199

1106877,4,6306012052,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and I think that it is underrated. Samuel L. Jackson is Marine Colonel Terry Childers and Tommy Lee Jones is the lawyer who must defend him. The movie begins in some nameless jungle in Vietnam where Childers and Jones are soldiers fighting Charlie. A huge gun battle ensues and Jones's group is massacred. But Childers convinces the VC leader to call off the attack by killing his radio operator. Then we are taken to the present day, to San'aa, Yemen, where Childers is forced to get the ambassador out. His marines are being shot at, he thinks by the crowd, and so he orders his marines to open fire. They do, and so begins his difficult legal battle. It is not ""A Few Good Men,"" Rob Reiner's spactacular military courtroom drama, but it is a good, interesting look at the military's justice system, and it keeps you riveted. It is not a really surprise ending, but it works. Jackson is absolutely amazing and Jones plays his part well as Childers's lawyer and friend.

1106879,3,6306012052,"The Rules of Engagement had the potential to be an excellent movie that is marred by a couple of bad script and direction decisions.  The acting by the two leads, Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones is dead on, and the combat action is feverish and brutal, as well as it should be.  The movie also raises very interesting questions, but fails to deliver in the end.
The movie opens with a flashback to Vietnam, where we learn of the bond of brotherhood shared by these two Marines, and see them action.  Mr. Jackson, who plays Col. Childers, saves Mr. Jones' character, Col. Hodges, who is severely injured in combat and reduced to a desk job, becoming an undistinguished attorney for the Corps.  Childers, on the other hand, continues in a long and distinguished career, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel and assigned command of a Marine rapid deployment unit sent to the Middle East (Yemen).  There, they face a rioting mob in front of the US Embassy, and the situation quickly deteriorates from rock throwing to active gunfire and Molotov cocktails.  After evacuating key personnel from the embassy, Childers makes the tragic decision that results in his eventual court martial.  He orders his men to fire at the crowd in front of the embassy, thereby killing 83 men, women, and children, and injuring hundreds more.
All this sets the stage to a courtroom drama that is filled with tension and anguish.  However, after the build-up of the first two thirds of the movie, the script and director make two key decisions that drains the movie of its emotional and moral dilemmas, thus stripping the movie of its message and purpose.
The movie, as it starts out, shows Col. Childers as a determined and fiercely loyal and patriotic soldier, a man who takes decisive action and is unafraid to shed blood in order to save his soldiers' lives.  It is a credit to Mr. Jackson's acting that this unflinching, uncompromising soldier comes across as sympathetic and likable.  However, therein lies the problem.  After the Yemen massacre, the US Government wants to quickly resolve the matter to dispel any notion within the Arab nations that the US condoned the killing.  The deck is stacked against Childers from the beginning, with a sleazy National Security Advisor and a hot shot Marine attorney thrown against Childers and Hodges.  But since the movie takes the stance that Childers is the protagonist of the movie, it is unwilling to demonize him.  As a matter of fact, the crucial flaw of the movie is showing too much to the audience in order to exonerate him.  Unfortunately, the moviemakers also wanted to maintain the dilemmas they set up in the premise of their film.  This leaves for a dual-personality film that attempts to leave doubt in the minds of the character whereas the audience knows that there is none, and thus, the director, as he admits in his audio commentary, is forced to bootstrap a resolution to the film by throwing some text at the screen before the credits roll out.  Although he wanted doubt and ambiguity, the director is forced to provide the typical Hollywood ending, where the good guys ride victoriously into the sunset and the bad guys lose.
I focused primarily on Mr. Jackson's character because he is the focus of the maelstrom all around him, but that is not meant as a denigration of Mr. Jones' acting.  In fact, he carries the heavier burden of playing a bitter, weaker man, who had all the potential to be as good a soldier as Childers, but denied it, as he puts it, by a flip of a coin.  By no means is Col. Hodges, as Mr. Jones plays him, defined by bitterness, but rather, he understands his shortcomings as being the result of the events that took place in Vietnam so many years ago.  Therefore, he finds redemption and vindication in trying to defend his life-long friend.
Again, the acting is top notch by an excellent cast, which includes a couple of cameos by two very good actors who play the ambassador to Yemen and his wife.  The quality of the DVD is top notch, with vibrant details, clear visuals, and good use of 5.1 surround, especially in the combat scenes.  The DVD contains the above mentioned director's commentary as well as a brief making of featurette.  I don't recall whether it contains a trailer.
In conclusion, this is a great film that is indeed hobbled by compromises in the script.  The acting by the leads is excellent, the questions the film raises are compelling and timely, but the answers are simply nothing more than Hollywood fluff.  The current way Hollywood makes movies is truly the greatest culprit in the film: the changes that are brought to bear on a movie because it did not test well, or because the hero must be a hero, no matter what the script demands.  It short-changes the audience's capacity to deal with conflicts, spoon feeding them cheap answers to formidable questions of race, politics and the role of the US in an increasing complex geo-political landscape.",982368000,2,4962,4.7406976744186045

If you're a Sam Jackson/Tommy Lee Jones fan then you should have this in your collection..they bring out the best in each other.

Without William Friedkin's Brilliant Visual Sence and Natural Direction Skills, Without Samuel's Brilliantly Angered Performance and Tommy's ""Underplay and Let Samuel Shine"" approach, Without Wonderful Support from Guy Pierce and Bruce Greenwood, this film would have been far less effective.
The Entire Goal of the film is to make Samuel a Character that the audience will care about. I did, because I'm a Huge Samuel fan, but I can understand why Critics and Audiences alike found his Character Repellant and Unlikeable. He Orders and takes part in the Killing of about 90 Protesters, which include woman and Children, and they Critically Wound Hundreds more. I Admired the film for having the guts to be so Honest about the horrors of war without resorting to Crappy ""Thin Red Line""-ish Poetry. Some have also accused the film of being downright Racist in its treatment of the Yeman people, I wouldn't go that far, but I can Understand why others do. The Action Scenes are Brilliantly done, the Courtroom scenes are Brilliantly done, (but still no match to ""A Few Good Men"") the only let down is the screenplay, which is Overwrought is Some places, Lacking in others. The Characters are Adequetly Developed and the Flow is good, but the only things that are spot on are the Performances and the Direction.

He also, in no uncertain terms, points out the appalling betrayal the men and women of our armed forces are daily subjected to by the politicians who are supposed to stand up for them.  Finally, all this violence and intrigue is juxtaposed against a smart court room drama, in whcih Samuel Jackon's character is being court-martialed essentially for protecting himself and his troops.
This is a smart, exciting movie that is bound to ignite controversy.  But that is what good movies do, and this one carries a powerful message about duty and honor.
As for the DVD, it's nothing special, extra feature wise.  However, with all the battle scenes in this movie, it benefits from the high quality A/V features that come with any DVD.",980208000,11,1031,4.726256983240224

Childers and Tommy Lee Jones costars as Colonial Hayes Hodges, both of whom portraying patriots of Vietnam in 1968. The opening setting takes the viewer back to Vietnam for what may seem to have an irrelevant effect on the plot. Contrary to the popular prior opinion, the scenes of Vietnam do an outstanding job at displaying the bonds between these two Marines and they also define their grit and guts that very few officers possessed, which helped prolong the lives of these two colonials. The picture regains it's coverage 28 years after Vietnam, in a 1996 incident, that questioned whether a call made by Childers was barbaric or necessary. As the United States Marine Corps. temporarily inspected the condition of a portion of Islam, looking for no war games, unexpected violence erupted from what was apparantly the attack of the civilian residents. Alarmed, Colonial Childers decided to ""tug the rope back towards him"" and ordered attack. Several things were in question revolving around this: whether the gunfire was coming from the civilians, whether they(civilians) could have been evacuated if it wasn't their guns, and whether the rules of engagement were followed correctly.  As a trial was scheduled, Childers selected Hodges to serve as his lawyer to stop him from going to jail for the remainder of his life after being accused of being responsible for the casualties of 83 Islamic civilians.  The storyline takes a short while to develop, but turns out to be a very compelling one that would, if ever in our society, take multiple months to conclude. An excellent plot with a few little blunders helps make ""Rules of Engagement"" one of the more taut political dramas in the past couple of years.",979776000,,1804,4.970198675496689

This tough time together cemented their friendship, indebted Tommy Lee Jones' character to Samuel Jackson's but also brought in question, the type of soldier Samuel Jackson's character was.
Years later, upon Tommy Lee Jones' character's retirement, he once again sees his old friend.  You see that Samuel Jackson's character has gone on to more wartime heroism and Tommy Lee Jones' character is retiring as an service (Marines) attorney.
Events develop shortly after his friends retirement, where Samuel Jackson is called in to rescue an ambassador holed up in an embassy in Yemen.  The protests have gotten ugly and there is concern for the ambassador and his family's welfare.
Events during this rescue unfold that result in significant casualties among the locals and Samuel Jackson is held personally responsible for this.
Telling you why and any details around that would ruin the story for you.
However, in his need for legal representation, Samuel Jackson's character calls on his retired friend in Tommy Lee Jones' character.  Jones' character is concerned that his skill as a lawyer will not be sufficient for his old friend's problem.  Lucky for his old friend Tommy Lee Jones' character overprepares himself.
The investigation and the details are pretty interesting.  Some commentaries on allowable force in a war or skirmish are made.  Depending on your viewpoint, you may agree or dissagree.
When I started watching this movie, I was not aware that it was based on a true story. I still have not seen this stated explicitly.  However in the ending they stated the status of the various parties involved, so I drew this conclusion.
This movie was not all splash and dash.  Which lets face it, if it is based on reality, this is appropriate.  Some conclusions seemed like leaps of logic.  We did not see the build up that got you there. The conspiracy, seems too complete as well.

I think the movie starts out quite strong with intense scences from Vietnam and Yemen which starts the controversy.  I particularly like the embassy footage, you really feel like you are there while the action unfolds before your eyes.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't maintain its momemtum after these first scenes.
I think the movie tries to cover too much ground and jumps around a lot.  It is hard to figure out why certain scenes are included, like the fistfight scene, while other topics are glossed over.  I was most disappointed with the courtroom scenes which seem weak in comparison with A Few Good Men.

That Colonel should have been found guilty on all three counts and he should have been brought up on war crime charges after his dishonorable behaviour in Vietnam.  So because the Germans under Peiper gunned down American GI prisoners of war it makes it okay for an American commander to mow down German prisoners of war?  No, so just because the Vietnamese commander would have shot a prisoner of war does not in any way excuse an American from commiting a war crime either.

Now, on to the embassy.  The problem I had with this part is that he had OTHER options.  He could have fired into the air, he could have and should have suppressed the fire from the snipers on the other buildings.  Just because you receive fire does not then entitle you to do whatever you want to do.  There are rules in combat and in war and they are there for a reason.  It also made total a sham of the military court.  They are there to try the evidence and based on the testimony of everyone involved - the judgment would have been for guilty.

1107004,2,6306012052,"The keystone to your enjoyment of this film is whether you can accept the nature of the villain.  RULES OF ENGAGEMENT casts in evil light the actions of a National Security Advisor who says in one breath that he's not going to have a coverup but then immediately reverses himself and confiscates evidence.  In so doing, he willfully condemns a highly decorated Marine to virtually certain imprisonment, and possibly death.  Why? If the Marine (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the fall as a rogue colonel, then the American government itself won't be seen as an enemy by the region.  Yet the seized evidence is a tape which clearly shows that Jackson was being fired on and that he had every right to return fire.  Surely, then, the release of this tape would not only free Jackson, but remove any diplomatic quandaries as well.  It's hard to imagine moderate Middle East countries like Egypt and Jordan, which this fictional NSA is worried about, getting angry with the US for defending itself.  And that's where the movie fails.  The premise is just wrong.
More than that, details are weird, too.  Chain-of-command leaps to mind.  The NSA has no place in the diplomatic hierarchy.  Why he's seen as having some sway over the US Ambassador to Yemen is thus kinda strange.  Ambassadors obviously report to the Secretary of State.  Wouldn't this Ambassador have thought to check out the NSA's threats of retribution with his boss before perjuring himself?  And once he did that, wouldn't the red flags have gone up at State?  I mean, the whole cover-up is portrayed throughout the movie as an NSA-only job.  If the Ambassador goes to State to check it out, the Secretary would presumably have immediate problems with the NSA.  Beyond that, the Ambassador would've been debriefed long before he even saw the NSA, and he would've told the debriefing officer the pro-Sam Jackson story he initially told the NSA.  Because the NSA isn't in the State Department chain of command, I would personally think there was no way for this character to have exerted the kind of control over this situation depicted.
As a result of these problems, the movie ends up wasting a lot of good stuff, including fine acting and competent direction.  Though watchable, there are better military court movies.",977529600,2,2275,4.862337662337662

Jackson), in a military story. O.K., so far, so good. Though this movie technically was well-done, it fell far short of glory, besides the fact that these two proven Hollywood winners were in it.
Jackson plays career Marine Terry Childers, who is sent to Yemen on a mission to extricate the U.S. ambassador and his family, who apparently have suffered the ire of the local Muslin populace (for what, it is not apparently known. All we really DO know is that Islamic Jihad handed out cassette tapes of the usual kill-the-American-dogs line, and the people went ape-excrement). Childers succeeds in completing his mission, but finds that he and his Marine detachment are getting pounded by enemy fire on the surrounding rooftops, as well as on the ground. Childers orders his men to fire on the crowd, killing many young people. He finds himself facing court-martial in the States, on the grounds that the people he fired upon had no weapons. Thus begins a manhunt on Childers by the State Department, undoubtedly worried about a Lebanon-like situation.
Enter Jones as Hayes Hodges, a soon-to-retire career Marine. Like his Vietnam-era comrade, Childers, Hayes had seen what life was like in the trenches. However, Hodges was not as successful in combat as his beleaguered friend, so instead opted for life as a military defense attorney. Childers puts his future career in the hands of his longtime Marine friend, believing that since Hodges knew what combat conditions were like, he would be the ideal person to defend him. Hodges, though, feels that he can't compete against hot-shot prosecutor Biggs (Guy Pearce), who's been hired by the Secretary of State, Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood).
Much of the film deals with the court-martial. Unfortunately, everything that would have made this a great film wasn't there; things like suspense, retribution, or a slam-dunk ending were just, well, missing in action. The end of the film is so anti-climactic, it makes one wonder what the fuss was all about. Even the usually solid performances by Jones and Jackson aren't enough to redeem the lack of spirit in the last 20 minutes of the film.

1107051,3,6306012052,"""Rules of Engagement"" is a terse and tough drama that opens in the Vietnamese war and moves to the Yemen of today in a story that could easily have been ripped from today's news stories.

Jackson is accused of ordering his Marine troops to open fire on a group of men, women and children who were allegedly peacefully protesting at the American Embassy, and murdering eighty-three of them.  He enlists his Vietnam buddy, Tommy Lee Jones, to come out of retirement to defend him and save his career and reputation.  The story moves along at a rapid pace, sparked by outstanding performances by Jones and Jackson.  The many close-ups of their endlessly subtle reactions create a powerful effect and draw you into the drama.  The story itself is thought-provoking and challenging in that it asks the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions regarding right and wrong in the Middle East.  Blair Underwood is on deck to deliver an excellent two scene tour-de-force; he is well on his way to becoming one of our finest younger actors.  Ben Kingsley and, especially, a notably de-glamorized Anne Archer, also provide high points.  Director William Friedkin keeps things moving right along with his hand on the pulse of the story throughout.  Well worth the time.",976752000,2,1266,4.851162790697674
1107052,2,6306012052,"It's hard to believe that great actors like Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson had anything to do with this movie.  It was so Hollywoodish and predictable that I had to turn it off half way through it because I already knew the ending.  The writer of the film seemed to be trying to mix a little of A Few Good Men with an action movie, and failed miserably.  The main story is that Jackson, a commander in the army gives an order to fire on a group of hostile protesters that had weapons.  Turns out that after the incident, the guns were removed and Jackson is charged with murder.  He in turn calls on his friend, Jones, who is a lawyer, to get him out of the mess.  From then on it's pretty much the investiagation and a small little court room drama torwards the end. The only thing that really saved this film from being one of the worst was the two star actors and their ability to give believeable performances.  But from now on Hollywood should think before just trying to cast big stars to sell a movie.",975369600,,1015,4.255208333333333

Both Jackson and Jones have really terrific performances. What I think is missing is some more addons on this DVD. Yes there is a commentary track, interviews and the making of documentary. I just thought there could have been more content in each of those areas I just mentioned. I expect more from new dvds.

Jackson plays as the Marine colonel sent in to stop a riot of Arabian citizens at the American embassy in Yemen?  Well anyway, Jackson gives the order to open fire on the crowd on the grounds that the crowd was carrying weapons.

1107057,4,6306012052,"The directorial career of William Friedkin is very peculiar. After FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST, he was one of the kings of Hollywood; 15 years later, he was directing cheap horror movies. So one can consider his last movie RULES OF ENGAGEMENT as a kind of resurrection. I'm personally glad with this come-back, William Friedkin being a first-class action movie director.
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is an excellent movie you can rent with the eyes wide shut and believe me, it's pretty rare nowadays. The movie will please the courtroom movie fan as well as the war movie buff. If you are looking for acting performances, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Kingsley play here multidimensional characters and even the suspense fan is going to like the way William Friedkin plays with the nerves and the sense of observation of the audience.
Images and sound are perfect and the featurettes are, for once, interesting and instructive.

The action in the beginning was excellent.  The character development and storyline were much better than I had hoped. And, I groaned at the thought of having to sit through court room scenes since they can be boring.  Not so here.  The court room scenes added to the tension and were of an appropriate length.

It has two things going for it:  terrific acting and fine direction from William Friedkin, and both elements are able to withstand the flaws.
The film's best parts are in the first half hour, featuring two riveting action sequences, involving the jungle hell of Vietnam and the rescue of the ambassador in Yemen.  The rest of the film can't quite match this in intensity, but then again, that only goes to prove that Friedkin can stage an action sequence.
The ending is when the film starts to lose steam.  No major revelation occurs, the entire trial moves in a straightforward, routine manner, and in the end, it feels anti-climactic, as if though nothing huge was accomplished.",972172800,,838,4.798611111111111

1107100,5,6306012052,"Five stars for being an intelligent, timely and topical tale well enough done to grab and hold you hard.
I write as former Navy (not USMC) vet and retired U.S. career diplomat.  You better believe that we in an embassy under assault would be blessing those Marine or Navy choppers coming in to get us out and any other U.S. military involved in such an operation.  But it wouldn't be only the ambassador and his wife and child as in this film.  What about the rest of the embassy staff?  The fight between the Jones and Jackson characters after Jones returns from abroad and suspects his friend is guilty is not credible and detracts from the story line.  The testimony of the Viet Cong vet at the court martial is too contrived, a series of monosyballic yeses.
But these are quibbles.  This film addresses very big issues well and credibly:  USMC traditions and loyalty, feckless senior U.S.government officials driven by politics and media first, courage and bravery versus sleaze.
The assault on the embassy was very gripping.  That sequence was so REAL.  I was, sorry to say, so drawn in that when the beleaguered Marines opened fire on the crowd below I exclaimed, ""good riddance.""  In fact, it remains unclear through most the film whether the people in the courtyard, as opposed to the snipers on rooftops, did have guns (though they were doing more than yelling, i.e., throwing Molotov cocktails).  Good mystery direction in that respect.
A superlative DVD sountrack too, very satisfying on my multiple-subwoofer sound system.",971740800,6,1534,4.884169884169884

1107102,3,6306012052,"Friedkin really tried to make this movie feel legitimate. When you build an interesting idea up from a shaky plot and even more unlikely story, however, you're bound to end up with some sort of mishap. That's exactly what happens here.
I wanted to believe the things I saw. I watched eagerly as the characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson were established in the jungles of Vietnam. I liked it. Dare I say, it felt real.
Unfortunately, what transpires afterwards is a load of hogwash. The basic premise involves Samuel Jackson, a military colonel, being dropped into what had been a peaceful demonstration outside the US embassy in Yemen. His mission is to protect the embassy, and if necessary, to evacuate the ambassador and his family. Since the demonstration gets out of control, the ambassador evacuates and leaves Samuel there with his marines. At this point, the movie takes some care to ""not"" show you what really goes on, so that there will be this lingering question in your mind as to whether or not Samuel Jackson's character is guilty of the murder of a group of unarmed demonstrators.
This is the first sticky point of the movie. We are misled with everybody else into not knowing what to think about the occurrence. How are we supposed to feel compassion for a guy that we just saw murder all of these people? Regardless of any vindication that may come later, it's hard to feel good about what we see on the screen. The rest of the movie involves Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel's old Vietnam buddy trying to exonerate him from murder charges we aren't sure if he committed. Trust me, it sounds more intriguing than it really is.
This whole scenario is made even more murky by a tainted National Security Administrator that causes the surviving video (which we find out would totally clear Samuel Jackson of the charges) to be ""lost.""
The ending is lackluster melodrama that, for me, was totally unbelievable. Worth a rental but not enough to own. This could of been a great movie contrasting the combat-experienced men of Vietnam with modern day ""Peacekeepers,"" but as it is, it relies on cheap sentimentality to make its impact. Weak dialogue and an unbelievable story killed this one.",971654400,3,2211,4.775456919060052
1107103,4,6306012052,"Despite various flaws, this film succeeds at creating a strong drama with two excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is an interesting premise in today's world where the lines between politics and warfare become ever fuzzier.  Is a commander justified to engage an enemy to protect his men if there is a high probability of killing innocents?  With increasing frequency, radical groups use human shields to capitalize on this Western dilemma.  This film brought some of these issues to the fore, and though sloppily done in parts, it was an entertaining treatment of the issue.
Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) is no stranger to action flicks, and the action scenes were extraordinarily realistic.  The trial was also well done from a dramatic standpoint, but some glaring flaws went unexplained.  For instance, are we to believe that with all the firing that occurred from the ground, forensics experts couldn't find a single bullet hole with a ground-based trajectory?
By far the best aspect of this film was the acting.  Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding as the shot-up marine who turned into a second rate lawyer to stay in the service.  Samuel L. Jackson continued to prove himself one of the better dramatic actors around with a stellar performance of the dedicated career officer thrown into an impossible situation and then fed to the wolves.  Guy Pearce also gave a fine performance as the prosecutor for the government, although he tried to hide his British accent by putting on a New York accent and it sounded phony.
Though unoriginal (see ""A Few Good Men""), this is a very watchable drama with some credibility problems, but the flaws were more than overcome by the great acting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It offers food for thought regarding the difficult demands we make on our military in the world of post cold war international diplomacy.",971654400,,1896,4.9495268138801265
1107104,4,6306012052,"Having served in the Marine Corps, I am a sucker for all things Marine. I am also a fan of both Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, but then again who isnt? These two powerhouse performers team up for one good movie.
Jackson plays Terry Childers who is a 30 year combat veteran colonel in the Marine Corps. Childers is sent into Yemen to rescue an Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his family. The mission gets quite hairy and terrorists and civilians both are caught in the firestorm to follow.  The incident in seen as an embarassment  at best and a political nightmare at worst by the folks in Washington and Childers is put on military trial for murder.  He asks his old buddy Hayes Hodges (Jones) to defend him. Hodges also happens to owe Childers his life from events in Vietnam.
The movie has the outcome you might expect and along the way we are introduced to a not so hidden conspiracy to frame Childers for the crime. What separates this usual plot from other films is the outstanding acting of Jackson and Jones.  Jones takes center stage and wows you as a former combat Marine turned military lawyer who struggles to search for his own identity and questions his value as a Marine along the way. Jackson as always delivers a rock solid and emotional performance.
The direction of this movie is particularly note worthy. It does an admirable job with addressing the modern military dilemna of fighting unseen enemies in urban environments. The director holds some things from you so that you will find yourself questioning the acts of the Marines involved in the shooting. Only at the end does he give you everything you need to know. This makes the movie better than most.
Overall it is great and the only thing that keeps it from being a five star flick is that Jackson's character, although central to the plot, had to take a backseat to Tommy Lee Jones performance. I thought the nature of the film would have benefited from more scenes surrounding how Childers was dealing with the consequences of his actions. Still, it is a movie worth adding to your collection. Enjoy.",971654400,47,2086,4.644986449864499
1107105,5,6306012052,"ROE was written by Vietnam Navy Cross winner James Webb, author of some of the best writing of this century: ""Fields of Fire"", ""Sense of Honor"", ""A Country such as this"". Not only does Webb know combat he knows political back-stabbing since he was the Secretary of the Navy in the late 80s. His portrayal of the non-tactical marine lawyer is right on the mark, too.
As I watched the film I asked for the Tommy Lee Jones lawyer to look for bullet holes in the embassy and use the trajectories as forensic evidence proving Samul Jackson's Colonel was justified for shooting into the crowd. Its not just a discrepancy in the film, its a show-stopper, Webb has bigger fish to fry and if bullet trajectory evidence is used, there simply is no movie, the colonel would be acquitted. Its like if Goldfinger just kills Bond on the laser table. The show-stopping movie point is something to balance against what the film is trying to say. And ROE has something VERY important to say. Intended and unintended.
Clearly the message that our government would hang the senior on the ground leader of a fiasco ""to dry"" is a proven fact of life today. Its already happened; Son Tay, Desert One, Beirut, Vincennes shoot-down of the Iranian airliner (probably where ROE story was derived by making it ground oriented). In the last case, the government went after the background of the on-scene commander just as it did to the Samuel Jackson's Colonel in the film. The result being life imitating ""art"" as we have brow-beat warrior behavior in our ranks with PCness to such a degree that in real life a real Navy ship was attacked by real suicide bombers in a rubber boat in Yemen, killing at least 17 real human beings. The point of the film is that we can't send men into harm's way following unrealistic policies/ROE and then abandon them by making them the scapegoats when fiascos result. The goal of this film is to educate the U.S. on this linkage. Now for the unintended message! The military is not without blame for not being better trained/equipped in spite of it all.
Let's strip a movie away to its essence, its a story restaged in live action. Its only as good as those who make it. Webb is a straight shooter, but he can only give us geopolitical and moral truths we should already know. His view of the battlefield is like most---no better than the Vietnam bullet ""garden hose"" exchanges that began the movie. First, fighting the enemy ""even"" bullets versus flesh, you can't afford to let the other's fire hit you first. The Vietnam battle scenes show that we need the best ""sensor"" available which isn't an electronic device but trained scout dogs organic to infantry units to get the ""drop"" on the enemy since noone wins if unarmored bodies exchange gunfire in a surprise meeting engagement. Later on in Yemen, Jackson did not brief his men adequately so that when they landed they knew what to do to silence enemy fire and regain fire superiority but got pinned down instead. In fact, the Army UH-1H and CH-47D helicopters painted to look like Mc UH-1N and CH-46 helicopters would have been shot down as they tried to land as they were fired upon without return fire (film shows gunman gleefully firing unhindered) as they are unarmored. It would have been ""Huey and SeaKnight down"" with crashed and burning helicopters in the streets ala Somalia. The men running from the helicopters did not form an adequate hasty security around them; Dale Dye should know better than this. In fact, men were dangerously close to the landing spot of an inbound CH-47D in one scene. A real foe would have blasted all 3 helicopters on the ground for sure. At this point, return fire would have to be rendered, but again a ""show stopper"".
Next, the marines were not wearing body armor capable of defending against AKM rifle rounds and men died when if they had such armor they could have taken some hits in order to exercise restraint and find out who it was shooting at them at apply more surgical return fire. The next failing is that we need to develop a gunshield that attaches to the end of our weapons so we can have enemy fire deflect so we can see enough to aim and regain fire superiority. If you have lost this, then what was shown is true, most men will be pinned down blind under cover as the leader exposes himself for a look to gain ""situational awareness"" and tell them what to do, which in Vietnam-style tactics would be to all return fire at once as depicted. If Jackson's men were adequately briefed, equipped with body armor/gunshields they could have seen generally where the fire was coming from to suppress/kill it. Where was the smoke grenades and CS tear gas to disperse the crowd non-lethally? Marine Security Guards have such things (and helmets/body armor) but these things would be ""show stoppers"" and we'd have no movie. Where were the medically trained personnel to stop the bleeding, treat the wounds of those hit? The U.S. Army has a Combat LifeSaver in every squad; there should have been a Navy Corpsman with the platoon.
Clearly the limitations of heliborne light infantry are shown in the film; and is visual proof of what we know from Somalia is true: that they need TRACKED LIGHT ARMORED FIGHTING VEHICLES that are helicopter deliverable to dominate physically the conflict on the ground without trading bullets into bodies. Light TRACKED AFVs landed with the marines could have secured the outer embassy and dispersed the crowd with non-lethal means without molotov cocktails or bullets harming them. At the very least, protecting the helicopters for them to wait until loaded with embassy VIPs/staff for extraction. These vehicles described well in General Dave Grange's Air-Mech-Strike: 3-Dimensional Phalanx book could also have TV cameras to document the truth (Tommy Lee Jone's lawyer character was eager to find to vindicate his client) so the military has its own source of proof that can't be conveniently ""lost"" by civilian bureaucrats who might have a different agenda than the truth. In the case of the marines they are buying expensive V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft that will fly a bit faster into trouble at a cost of BILLIONS but are too small to carry light AFVs to do the job on the ground better without ROE/Somalia-like results.
For a movie to raise such issues and make you think about our sense of honor and unintentionally our force structure/equipment, you have to give it 5 stars.",971481600,7,6419,4.742397137745975
