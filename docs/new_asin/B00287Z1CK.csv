3872069,5,B00287Z1CK,"I think most of you L fans will like this movie. It has very little to do with the previous films and the only connection is that this is last 23 days of life. Since I hated the way the story of L ended in the anime and manga, it was nice to see him get a somewhat nice goodbye. The story itself was fairly interesting about bio-terrorism but there were a few corny places, but not too many. Like I said, I think if you are a big L fan, you will like it. I did and I can see myself watching it again.",1250812800,,500,3.7714285714285714
3872070,4,B00287Z1CK,"I have a story:

Once upon a time, J.R.R. Tolkien was writing a sequel to the Hobbit. It had a lot of passages where the Hobbits just hung out in the Shire, smoking pipeweed, eating mushrooms, and what-not. He showed these early chapters to his friends. One of them, C.S. Lewis, decided to be frank. He told Tolkien that Hobbits were only entertaining if they were doing unhobbit-like things; things like, going on adventures...

What does this have to do with L and ""Death Note""? Well, the makers of this movie decided to do the same thing here: have L do things you wouldn't expect L to do.

Fans of ""Death Note"" will know that, when he fights Light, he has all these computers, high-tech gadgets, and people who work under him (the NPA, Watari, Raye & Naomi, Aiber & Wede, etc.). Light just has the Death Note, his wits, and whatever items are at his disposal. Arguably the coolest thing about Light is how he is able to improvise his way out of almost any situation.

Well, this movie basically puts L in Light's position. The film pits him against a terrorist group; but he can't use any of his gadgets, assistants, or financial resources. All he has are his wits and whatever he can improvise. They go a little further to put him in Light's shoes by having Ryuk be his Shinigami companion for a VERY brief period of time (it's not NEARLY as cool as I'm making it sound; It's a  cameo more than anything else). The terrorist group, meanwhile, has access to all of L's resources, including his media connections...essentially turning our oddball hero into a fugitive. In a way, this puts L in Mello's shoes as well.

Long story short, this movie turns L into something of an action hero. It gets weirder though. They actually have him (gasp) making real friends.

So now I've answered the first question: ""What is it?""

That just leaves us with the next question.

""Is it good?""

Well...that's not so easy to say.

Before I get into the good and bad, let me mention that you need to have either seen the other two films or read the spoilers to understand this one.

The Good:

For one, I think the concept I mentioned above is pretty cool. A big problem is they could have had L break character by putting him in a different genre, but they didn't. For that alone, I'm quite impressed.

L acts more like the original manga/anime version than he did in the previous films. I don't know if it was because there was a different director or if the actor just got used to the role by this point. He was ""okay"" in the other films; just not great. Here, he's the L we all know and love.

Some of the new characters are pretty good. There's a doctor that L meets in the second half that I liked a lot. Not only is he the best of the new characters, but I think he would have fit in well in the manga. He was just that good.

The Bad:

While the concept is cool, the execution just doesn't live up to it. It seems like they just rushed this movie through production and haphazardly threw everything together.

Despite being in a more ""Light-ish"" role, L is never backed into a corner the way Light was. I never felt any of that ""how-is-he-gonna-get-out-of-this-one"" anticipation that I felt with the manga.

A major character is introduced half-way through the movie. He's an FBI agent. Apparently, he knows all about Watari, but it never says how. For a while, they don't address why he`s even in Japan in the first place. He just pops out of nowhere like your standard Deus Ex Machinma. I'm guessing they had originally intended for the movie to be longer, but then they cut out about half of this guy's scenes. They leave just enough of him to confuse you.

The death scenes (yes, the terrorists DO kill people) are clearly MEANT to be scary, but they really just come across as cheesy.

Also, considering that the bad guys are supposed to function as an evil version of L, they sure don't leave the impression that L himself does. L is eccentric. These guys are just...campy. Oh. Did I mention that the main bad buy is a known terrorist, but that he doesn't even use an alias or a disguise? Either he's a moron or Japanese secruity is just that incompetent.

Bonus features are pretty standard. The DVD contains the English dub, the original Japanese audio, the Japanese trailers, the English trailer, and your typical ""behind-the-scenes"" promotional piece.

We also get an audio commentary. Is it the director? Nope. Is it the folks at VIZ who did the dubbing? Wrong again. This audio commentary is done by two fans: ""Death Nerd"" and ""Patrick"". These two guys kick back, spout out trivia about the franchise and actors, and make jokes. Overall, it was fun, but they got off track a little too much. At one point, they spend some time talking about the kinkier aspects of Japanese culture...that's just not something I'm comfortable with. Patick. Death Nerd. You guys did a good job and I hope you'll do more commentaries in the future. Next time, however, try to keep it ""approved for all audiences"".

Overall, not as good as the manga, but definitely better than the other two movies (which, aside from the first movie's EXCELLENT subway scene and the CGI Ryuk, I pretty much hated).

3 Stars for the movie, plus a 4th star thrown in for the (mostly) entertaining commentary.",1250640000,6,5276,4.528421052631579
3872071,3,B00287Z1CK,"The original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-Live-Action/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note (Live Action)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-II-The-Last-Name/dp/B001JTTJ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note II: The Last Name</a>&nbsp;are two of the finest anime-to-live action adaptations I have seen.  They were massive hits in Japan, and have gained a solid following in the West as well.

One of the driving forces behind the popularity was Matsuyama Kenichi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taste-of-Tea/dp/B000PMGNMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taste of Tea</a>) portrayal as the enigmatic L, a genius detective who stays hidden from the world and operates from behind a computer screen.  Matsuyama was a relatively unknown actor at the time, but managed to create a compelling character that was even more captivating than as originally imaged in the comic book series.

Just like with Hannibal Lector from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, audiences demanded more L, something complicated by the fact that the character of L dies at the end of ""Death Note: The Last Name.""  However, a death scene has never stopped a studio looking to cash in on a character's popularity!

Like many people, I was really looking forward to ""L: Change the World.""  Not only would I get to see Matsuyama assume his most famous role again, but master horror director Nakata Hideo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring/dp/B0009X765K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Water/dp/B0009KA2UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Water</a>) was at the helm, and it seemed destined to be an instant hit.  Unfortunately, 1+1 does not always equal 2, and ""L: Change the World"" is definitely the lesser entry in the Death Note trilogy.

Nakata solved the problem of L's death by setting the adventure in the twenty-three days between when L wrote his own name in Misa's Death Note, and when he was show dying peacefully eating a candy bar.  The set-up begins when a young boy shows up, claiming to be the only survivor of a deadly bio-weapon outbreak in Thailand.  The outbreak appears to be an act of terrorism by an eco-group who wants to wipe out a third of the human population in order to make the Earth livable again, without so many humans draining its resources.  L swings into action, taking on the young boy and another young girl, Maki, on a quest to create an antidote to the deadly virus and save the world from the eco-terrorist's vile plan.

The plot, on the whole, is somewhat by-the-numbers, and pairing L up with a pair of kids was not the best decision.  Nakata has said that he wanted to show L's human side, his weaknesses and emotions, but these things only serve to make L less interesting.  The character works as a super-human oddity, so massive in brain power he has difficulty associating with other people.  He shouldn't be paired with a cute young girl with a can-do personality and a charming smile.  He shouldn't be wasting his abilities battling villains who are so campy and stupid.

Which is not to say that ""L: Change the World"" is horrible.  Matsuyama's characterization of L is still fantastic to watch, and the film does have some great moments. L's Crepe Truck is a lot of fun, as is watching him try to calm down a girl who just watched her father get killed by offering her a candy, and not understanding why that doesn't work.  The juxtaposition with L and Maki does work, but at times it comes off as too cutesy.

I think what is really missing from ""L: Change the World"" is a credible villain.  In both Death Notes, L had to match wits with someone almost his equal, the owner of the Death Note Light Yagami.  However, the leader of the eco-terrorist gang does not nearly operate on L's level, and the outcome is never in doubt.

As a fan of the Death Note films, I was glad to watch this final entry.  It is a lesser film, but worth watching for Matsuyama's portrayal of L.  Seeing both earlier films is definitely a pre-requisite, as certain parts of ""L: Change the World"" won't make sense without understanding the previous installments.",1250553600,11,4490,5.724397590361446
3872072,3,B00287Z1CK,"L: CHANGE THE WORLD is the spin-off of the highly successful DEATH NOTE and DEATH NOTE: The Last Name. (Marketers would call it Death Note 3) The two films based on the Japanese comic book (also adapted into an anime series) were box-office hits all over Asia, so obviously, Japanese filmmakers, taking a page from Hollywood's book intends to capitalize on its fame. However, the film seems more of an ode to the series and is aimed generally to diehard fans. Those unfamiliar with the two live action films may be alienated so I suggest you watch those first before viewing this film.

The tale occurs in the final 23 days L (Kenichi Matsuyama) has left in the world. A killer virus had killed the occupants of a small village in Thailand. A former colleague named ""F"" discovers the secrets of the virus and sends a young boy somehow immune to the fatal disease to L's doorstep. A few days later, 12-year old Maki ( Mayuko Fukuda) also shows up with a different strain of the virus, described as a combination of Ebola and Influenza. Apparently, her father Nikaido (Shingo Tsurumi) had created the virus and a subversive group called ""Blue Ship"" is after it. Leader Dr. Kujo (Youki Kudoh) intends to use it to change the world by ridding it of all the useless people who inhabit it--useless people are those who abuse our natural resources; so you can guess exactly just how many people they intend to eliminate.

The film cleverly takes place during the last 23 days of L's existence. Changing the world by killing ""useless"" people? The first two films focused on the scum of the Earth, and the theme may be somewhat similar to the ""Death Note"" franchise in its own way. While ""Death Note"" dealt with the supernatural and mystical world of ""Death Gods"", this time around, the ""death god"" is man-made. ""L: Change the World"" isn't really a bad film but the absence of a real effective villain such as Light Yagami, the film fails to impress. You may say that the villains in this film are pretty routine and the direction by Hideo Nakata while very competent, has so little to work with. ""Death Note 1 and 2"" were full of cerebral thrills and they kept me in the edge of my seat. The mind games between Light and L were the two films' showstopper, and without an effective manga to back this film up, the antagonists were left unexplored and their goals a little too predictable.

L is the same sugar-loving genius, punk rock refugee with bad posture; quirky and full of eccentric charisma. All these seem a little wasted when the genius detective is set against a rather very underwhelming antagonist. Sadly, his displays of outsmarting and staying one step ahead of Dr. Kujo and Matoba neither immerses or impressed me. The main reason why the two Death Note films were so successful is because they were full of surprises and at times quite difficult to predict what may happen next. Every good hero needs a good villain or his exact opposite. The film's simple exposition makes the film a lot less thrilling and suspenseful but it does eliminate the complexities of the wordy dialogue that some viewers saw that it hampered ""Death Note"" a little. (not for me though)

Kenichi Matsuyama's portrayal of L is endearing and charming, and the character does get a lot of character development in place of displays of his super-intellect and cunning brain. The Death Note series focused more on mind games and a somewhat convoluted plotline, this time around, the film focuses more on L's personality. He develops a warm connection with the young boy (later named ""Near"") who is also a mathematical genius. You see more as to how L spends his last days, and it was quite entertaining to see him reject the temptation of the ""notebook of death"" by burning it. His involvement and compassion for Maki is quite satisfying as he tries his best to comfort her and shows that such an eccentric individual is capable of emotion. L's ""Crepe and Ice Cream mobile"" put a smile on my face as I am sure fans will find this very amusing and cute (?). L also tries his hand at being an action hero but all we really see him do is run, climb and straighten his back.

L isn't as compelling or interesting a figure without a mystical situation with surprising twists or a nemesis such as Light Yagami; you may say they are two sides of the same coin. A hero is only made by the villain he faces? If the producers manage to create a formidable villain worthy of L's supposed magnificent intelligence, a new franchise may work. The film just isn't as intense as its two predecessors but at least I found it fun to watch. The film is a little slower-paced than I expected and suspense is only found on occasion and when they are, it may get a bit redundant. The film just doesn't possess the darkness inherent in the ""Death Note"" live action films, but for die-hard fans of the series, this film is definitely still worth a look. Others may feel little lost and maybe a little bored without knowledge of this character. This film wasn't on par with ""Death Note"" but at least it wasn't as bad as I feared.

Recommended timidly to fans of Death Note and a good rental for everyone else [3 Stars]

3872078,5,B00287Z1CK,"Note: This review does not contain major spoilers for L: Change the World, but it does contain spoilers for the previous two Death Note films (not the mention the manga and the anime).

Death Note is a somewhat character-driven story. The characters are three-dimensional and entertaining. Throughout any version of the story, most people are probably on the edge of their seats waiting to see what they will do next. There are even some thought-provoking elements in the plot, and some of the deaths can be emotional. But I think anyone would agree that the series is far from touching.

So how does this movie, which is called The Unwritten Chapter of Death Note, get away with it? In fact, more sensitive viewers might even want to keep a box of tissues handy. I nearly needed one myself.

L: Change the World is the story of Ls last days. According to the rules of the Death Note, he has only 23 days to live after writing down his own name inside it, which he did in order to survive long enough to solve the Kira case before he would inevitably be killed. The filmmakers utilized this plot device in order to bring the story to its end in just two films, and it really was a brilliant move in a lot of ways. At the very least, it opened the door for this delightful spinoff movie.

After Light Yagamis demise, L spends his last 20 days working on yet another case that has cropped up and aiding two children who have become entangled in it.

L is pitted against an organization that resorts to performing entirely evil crimes for what they feel are all the right reasons. Remind you of anyone? When the plot became clear, I felt like cheering. What an ingenious move to design the antagonists of this last movie in the Death Note series as ones who are not so different from Light Yagami in their motivations and methods.

However, the essence of the movie is not primarily concerned with this case. The real story lies with L and his interactions with two children. Maki, whose name is the only thing that connects her to the original series, is a 12-year-old girl who is struggling with the desire to avenge her father. A nameless boy, whom any Death Note fan will immediately recognize as, in some fashion, the boy genius Near, is along for the ride because he is somehow immune to the strange virus that has cropped up in some areas of the world.

This movie is a real triumph both in relation to the series and on its own. The story is moving and thoughtful. Its full of memorable quotes and moments, and the last line is sure to remain in my mind. In this movie, L truly becomes human, and his inevitable end is more acceptable than his sudden flop in the manga.

(As a small criticism, I felt there was a bit too much gratuitous violence in this film. It could easily warrant a TV-14 rating, which I thought was a bit unnecessary. However, the story makes up for it and its hardly worth mentioning).",1431907200,,2912,4.4605263157894735

It was mildly enjoyable to see how the last twenty three days were even if they were kind of pointless. An ok movie, but only for fans of Death Note, especially the live action movies. I can't imagine how bad this movie would be for people who haven't seen the previous installments.",1364256000,,430,4.597402597402597

bought it more or less or the completion aspect of having the whole set.
but still very interesting to see what the filmmakers did to fill in the gap between the 23 days and L's death at the end of the 2nd film.",1356566400,,253,3.980392156862745

3872111,2,B00287Z1CK,"The acting was terrible and L's character had no opportunity to be the eccentric genius he usually is.  It lacked the thrill, suspense, quarks, and story line of the previous two movies and the series itself.

3872112,4,B00287Z1CK,"L is back for this final Death Note film.  For fans of L, this movie is a nice addition, letting the viewers see what happened in L's last days, and even how he left a successor.

It's not the strong, intense film that the other two films were.  Without Light, there is a rivalry lacking, and L was at his most brilliant with a worthy adversary. The acting is still great; Kenichi Matsuyama really rocks the L role.  I think paring him with kids allowed for a lighter tone in this film, allowing L's ""last days"" to be touching and more human.

It's not the best film of the three, but it has it's charms and remains one of my favorites.",1328140800,,636,4.223140495867769

3872114,5,B00287Z1CK,"This dvd is very interesting. This movie follows L's final 23 days of life as he tries to solve a case about a deadly virus.

3872116,5,B00287Z1CK,"The loveable Rich Detective L with the Beast Man Complex (HE-man) and insatiable  love of sweets is back to roll one last time, showing the audiences things he's never done before.  While L saves the world from evil Bio Terrorist Group led by Agent K(the new Kira), he drives a Pink Van, runs, rides a bike, eats right and tries to correct his posture.  The only thing he didn't have time for was to find love, however; he was still able to be a father figure to a little boy and little girl.

 L has 23 days to save the world.  Deathnote 2 showed a surprise ending different from the comic book itself showing  L as he usually stays one step ahead of all his enemies.  He even stays one step ahead the holder of the Deathnote, a female Shimagami(Death God).  He grabbed the Deathnote before she did.  When the Shimigami got back to the Deathnote to write L's name down, he didn't die at the right time.

 This movie is the result of what happened from that point.  I really enjoyed seeing L's versatility and his warmth towards others.",1313625600,,1036,4.389473684210526

3872119,4,B00287Z1CK,"So it's not in cannon. Most of it has nothing to do with anything. But heck, it's L! In my opinion, that character can't possibly get too much screen time. If you love L then you should be able to put up with the so-so plot, iffy dubbing (for those of us who don't speak Japanese) and unrealistic effects. L stays fairly true to character, despite being pushed outside his comfort zone (if he even has one... >> ). Light, Misa, Naomi and Ryuk make brief appearances. Near has an interesting alternate introduction in this movie. And if nothing else, the ""L babysitting two upset kids"" scene makes the whole thing worth it.",1294185600,,622,4.513274336283186

3872122,3,B00287Z1CK,"It deserves 2 stars, (but I only give it 3 because I am a Die Hard L fan.)  If you liked reading/watchign Death Note to route for Light, you would be sad to find him not in this picture.

The book was better.

The movie was sexist.  Why is it the female (girl) who has to make mistakes and be corrected and ""saved"" by the male hero?  In the book, the girl was the heroine who brought the villianess to repent her ways.  This movie brings a boy (Near) to take her place.",1278720000,,469,3.989247311827957
3872123,2,B00287Z1CK,"This is the third film in the Death Note series. It features the enigmatic genius L. This time L is embroiled in attempting to foil a terrorist plot involving a highly contagious virus. L has very little time before his own life is over because of his sentence in the death note from the previous film. (The death notes are supernatural books kept by the gods of the dead. The previous 2 films involved mortals receiving these books and writing the names of people they want to kill inside them. L wrote his own name to avoid becoming the latest victim of a serial killer- since he knew that if he died sometime in the future he wouldn't die at the hands of this killer).

I confess I didn't like this film half as much as the previous 2. Unlike the previous films, there are hardly any supernatural elements. And L isn't particularly an action character. There is a cameo briefly from Ryuk, (a death god), but that is it. L and the cast spend most of his time protecting 2 small children from the bad guys and foiling the plans of a crazed eco terrorist cell.

I was rather disappointed. The previous films were pretty good, but this one seemed weak. L is a good character though. So it was nice to see him in action, however I just don't think the plot or bad guys were strong enough or cerebral enough to be worthy of L or the 2 hours spent on it.",1272240000,,1350,4.290196078431372

3872125,5,B00287Z1CK,"I enjoyed this movie.  Obviously, it's going to be missing something given the absent cast, but as a standalone, it does well.  L is such an interesting and dynamic character, and that came across in this film, despite the poor choice of actor.

I like Ken'ichi Matsuyama - I've seen him in a few other films and he is a very capable actor - but an L, he is not.  No Japanese actor should be, since L is really a 'white boy'.  And I did feel that some of his mannerisms were more pronounced or exaggerated than they should have been, and that seemed to take away a lot of the subtlety for which L is known.  Still, he was the most adorable (and sexy in an awkward, boyish sort of way) thing ever in this film.

Death Note fans should certainly pick this up, along with the 2 novels that are out - L: Change the World & Another Note: LABB.  All 3 additions to the franchise are well worth a fan's time.",1265760000,,901,4.137931034482759

3872128,4,B00287Z1CK,"I wasn't really expecting much from this sequel to the Death Note saga, but I was pleasently surprised by it. The story centers around the strange, always hungry detective from the first two films, ""L"". This time, he gets involved with a plot by some crazies to release a bio-weapon that will kill millions. But the clock is ticking in more ways than one: L only has a few weeks to live due to his writing his own name in the Death Note book. In my opinion, this film is just as good as the first two and is a great end to the whole story arc. Fans of Asain cinema will love this one as well as those who rarely watch these types of movies.",1257120000,,640,4.087301587301587
3872129,5,B00287Z1CK,"L Change the World is a spin-off of Death Note.

In my opinion I liked this one better then the first too. They had a great story line and it shows you what L did the last 23 days he had left to live. You even get to meet some other people from Wammy's. It's pretty great.

This movie is just mainly for the big L fans out there. If you love L then I bet you would like this movie.

Ever since I got it i've watched it ALOT! I'm kinda addicted to it. xD and I've even started acting like L more xD

Anyway, I highly reccomend you watch this movie(:",1255392000,3,548,3.8230088495575223

3872131,3,B00287Z1CK,"This movie was simply okay. I loved both L and Light in the Death Note movies and animes/mangas but L just didn't seem like L in this movie. Both his deductive reasoning (what little he had to do since almost the whole plot line was handed to him by chance encounters) and humorous eccentricities were very diminished. I think to really enjoy this movie you really have to enjoy L even if he's not quiet himself. However, it was nice to see some stuff at the beginning that gave some insight into events in the other two movies, and the plot was good, it just wasn't Death Note. Even with the villain being a former member of Whammy House there never seemed to be the battle of wits you see between Light and L. So I suppose if you want a potentially heart warming story involving L and a decent plot you might like this movie, if you want the Psycho-drama of Death Note you won't find it here and, like me you'll probably be a little disappointed. My honest recommendation is to rent this if you really want to see it.",1253318400,,1019,4.3125
3872132,4,B00287Z1CK,"I knew this movie was a ""spin off""...I knew this movie would not be about Light or the Death Note (even though both are mentioned a few times...so with that said, I really enjoyed this movie. I loved seeing a more ""personal"" side of L. Its a part of his character that HAD to be there, but was never shown in the Death Note films. I recommend this movie to anyone that really enjoyed the Death Note movies as much as I did, just don't watch L Change The World with any expectations, and allow yourselves to enjoy it for what it is.",1251244800,3,531,4.165048543689321
