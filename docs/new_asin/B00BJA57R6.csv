8569404,2,B00BJA57R6,"I am normally a fan of the Stan Winston tutorial videos, although pricey, they usually have very good, detailed instruction. However, I was very disappointed in this dvd. Although the instruction begins with very good detail and insights, it ends at least 2 hours prematurely. I say this because we never see the final detailing and finishing of the maquette featured on the cover. The video only goes through the initial rough blocking of shapes then ends there, and does a cursory ""video collage"" of the final detailing that lasts MAYBE a minute or two. I would demand my money back if I could, because there is at least an hour or two more video instruction to get the model to the final construct. If they believe that I am going to pay $120 for the other 2 videos in the series, based on this one, they are sadly mistaken. Stan Winston, you have an unhappy customer on this one...",1481414400,,885,4.5375
