1785159,2,B00006LPCX,"The quality of the DVD's is good, and the new sound mix is excellent.  However, there are problems.  First, during Status Quo the voice track is not in synch with the video, this continues throughout Eric Clapton's set.  Also, compared with the original broadcast in 1990 on MTV, much is missing.  Pink Floyd's set, McCartney's set, Robert Plant, and the Clapton supergroup all had long sets on MTV, but for some reason are edited down here to almost nothing.  Why it is so watered down is a mystery, and a total disappointment.  The festival itself is 5 stars, remarkable, but this DVD can't generate more than 2 becuase of the poor effort.  I'll have to take my MTV tape and make a DVD-R out of it, I guess.",1044835200,7,709,4.4921875
1785160,5,B00006LPCX,"This still holds up as one of THE best festivals in rock history. The major talent that was on the bill was amazing, you had Eric Clapton, Elton John, Robert Plant with help from Jimmy Page. Don't forget Sir Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd to name a few. Genesis's great medley of classic songs just made the whole festival such a pleasure to hear and watch. Now if only Cliff Richard hadn't been on the bill it would have been even better. This is such a greatly improved version, even better than when MTV aired in in '90. To hear this DVD in 5.1 is why 5.1 surround sound was invented. If you do pick this one up...turn it up LOUD!",1039824000,5,632,4.231404958677686
1785161,4,B00006LPCX,"The best macro-concert from ""Live-Aid"". It was an unique event. This DVD is ok but I miss the full-version of Genesis' ""Turn it on again medley"" (it's almost half-length of original version and anybody can see and hear the cuts) and more Pink Floyd show.",1039046400,2,254,4.666666666666667
1785162,1,B00006LPCX,"I have the original copy of this on DVD with dolby pro logic sound track. Love the disc so I bought the new DVD with DTS and Dolby Digital. I was therefore disgusted when I started watching and noticed that the audio tracks and the video portions are not in sync and it looks like all the performers are doing a really bad job of lip syncing. Whoever is responsible for the terrible audio job should be disbarred from whatever technical organization they belong too and horsewhipped for having no professional pride in their work whatsoever.
Two thumbs down from this disgruntled buyer.",1038614400,17,586,4.699029126213592
1785196,4,B00006LPCX,"It brought back some great memories when the concert was telecast on MTV in 1990.  My only regret is on this DVD Genesis's performance of the Turn It On Again medley was edited, and some great songs that were part of it were not included in the DVD",1231459200,,248,4.166666666666667
1785197,3,B00006LPCX,"Good in parts, bounced around a fair bit, curious mix of styles and a bit of a teaser in that the ""stars"" would come on, sing 2 maybe 3 songs and then stop........ not awfully well tied together and at the end I felt that on balance it was just about ok but not great.",1184284800,,268,3.890909090909091
1785198,5,B00006LPCX,"I bought this for the fact that Mark Knopfler was in it.  I was blown away at the performances.  Pink Floyd did ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" and ""Run like hell"".  It was wonderful as always.  Paul McCartney whom I'm not a fan of, changed my mind.  ""Hey Jude"" was almost inspirational.  The band, Status Quo, sang ""In the army now"".  I really liked that one.  The biggest surprise for me was Genesis, Phil Collins sang the song ""Mama"" like I've never seen and heard someone sing before.  The band was unbelievable in this song too.  I Actually got goose bumps.  Play it loud!  I haven't really listened to Phil Collins since they went their different ways.  Eric Clapton, Elton John, Robert Plant (with Jimmy Page), Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits, Cliff Richards & The Shadows, Tears for Fears, Phil Collins and the Serious Band were all great too.  I couldn't find one bad or even mediocre performance.  It was wonderful to see some of these ""supergroups"" perform together.  The sound is very good for a live concert. The  DVD's are capable of Dolby Digital, Dts, and 5.1 Surround sound.  125,000 people were there for the benefit of the mentally handicapped kids.  These people sang and rocked their hearts out.  I am very critical of live music, not this one.  You will NOT be disappointed .",1182124800,3,1290,4.644444444444445
1785199,5,B00006LPCX,"This Concert is really superb. With many rock music stars on one place, ""Live at Knebworth"" is amazing experience.",1181174400,,114,5.052631578947368
1785200,4,B00006LPCX,"I bought this DVD because, I wanted to see some of these bands when I was a teenager but never got the chance. I think that Pink Floyd should have gotten more air time. Genesis was good, Robert Plant and Jimmy page was very good. Paul McCartney was not bad. Cliff Richard (Who was He??). Everyone else in the show was alright. But, All in All the entire show was great. Nice to see how these artist preformed on their own TURF.",1174867200,,427,4.219512195121951
1785201,5,B00006LPCX,"I have seen other reviews and although most people recomend this item, some have concerns and issues with editing. I respect the opinions of everyone but offer this view: listening to ""I think I love you too much"" performed by Knoppfler and Clapton, guitar mounsters, is worth the entire box; believe me, it is outstanding and something very unlikely to see again. If you know who these people are, you will not be dissapointed. Guranteed.",1149206400,3,439,4.866666666666666
1785202,3,B00006LPCX,"Yes, I am disappointed.  The sound is terrible.  Crowd sound levels are out of proportion to the music performed.  We have come to expect a much better editing job.  Of particular note, is that the sound track is out of sync with the video performances - especially on the Status Quo numbers.

It is nowhere near as complete as it could have been.  So many good performances were omitted.

I give it 3 stars simply because it was such a moving concert.  And it is better to have this record of it than to have none at all.  Maybe someday this event will get the first class treatment it deserves.",1142294400,9,596,4.345454545454546
1785203,4,B00006LPCX,"The previuos reviews have told a great deal about this concert.

i will just add in the details

I still find Cliff Richard and the Shadows performance not bad at all! as i listen to all sorts of music..

The only songs that was felt missing and kinda heartbreaking  were Pink Floyd numbers specially ""comfortably numb"" which had some suberb blistering guitar work.

overall still worth the buck the  as there so many artists you just can`t miss..",1132531200,3,447,4.666666666666667
1785204,3,B00006LPCX,"Trivial but true.  This 1990 Page-Plant reunion was the third time they'd shared stage since the 1980 crash of Zeppelin:

1985 - LIVE AID w/John Paul Jones + drums:T.Thompson/Phil Collins

1988 - ATLANTIC RECORDS 40TH ANNIV. - w/ JPJ + drums:Jason Bonham

It was the first time for the duo to play England since Led Zeppelin headlined Knebworth back in 1990.

  JOHN HENRY BONHAM - 25 YEARS GONE",1127520000,3,395,4.720588235294118
1785205,3,B00006LPCX,"I haven't seen the DVD at all but I felt compelled to write something becasue I was at the concert.

*Trivia - the tickets went on sale without any announcement of who was playing at all. The concert was as a benefit and the cost was quite steep for the time (about 25 or thereabouts) especially for an unknown quantity. It was only on the day of the concert (or perhaps a day or so before) that the line-up was announced.

If my memory serves me well it was also the day EC found out his son had died.

The day was particularly wet but was dry and a little windy at the start. I though Floyd may actually not play as their circular back drop almost blew away. They played without it anyway.

I do need to make one thing clear: This DVD represents only a sample of the whole day (the climax for me were really Hey Jude and Great Gig in the Sky - the latter I don't see on the track listing so it's not been added).

The other thing is one reviewer claims it was great to see the first reunion of Page and Plant since Zep broke up. Sorry, it was the second. Page and Plant did Live Aid with JPJ and Bonzo's son. They were billed as Page, Plant and Jones.",1124323200,2,1153,4.0394736842105265
1785216,2,B00006LPCX,"The earlier stereo release DVD was a disappointment because of the annoying video artifacts.  The editing was pretty much a hack job with most of the best performances from each artist eliminated.  In spite of that, I decided to purchase this version.  This has the same faults as the other along with a major audio sync problem most of the time. Its so bad you may wonder at times if the audio recording was from the same performance. There is no excuse for audio sync problems this severe.

What a shame!!  This could have been a great DVD had someone taken the time to correct the technical and editorial issues.  Perhaps somebody will see the sales potential and release a new longer version in the future without the technical problems.  Anyone who recorded the MTV airing years ago on VHS has better video than this DVD has.",1106006400,13,830,4.605442176870748
1785217,3,B00006LPCX,"Hi guys, the show is great with many beasts of the Rock but the sound channel separation is poor when listening in DD5.0 or DTS. The only part of the DVD that the sound is very good is on Genesis performance, excelent separation. For the other tracks you will not listen only the voice on your center speaker but also a mix of the right and left channels. The idea of the center speaker is to create an ilusion of the singer voice coming from only one point (front). Most of them, except Genesis is terrible. Again, the show is great.",1099440000,4,534,4.297029702970297
1785218,4,B00006LPCX,"As a big Tears For Fears fan, the 1990 Knebworth Concert was the final performance for the duo of Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal. This was my impetus for purchasing the ""Live At Knebworth"" DVD, but it also gave me a chance to see many of the legendary acts perform on one stage.  In a lot of ways, the 1990 Knebworth Concert would be almost a final hurrah for the fabled 'British Invasion' of the rock era.  The good news is their is some real good stuff on this DVD.  The bad news is that there are some flaws that do detract from the enjoyment of the program.

""Live at Knebworth"" is often knocked for having poor sound quality.  If you know about the Knebworth Concert, you will know that some of the acts (like Tears For Fears) performed in horrific weather conditions - rain and wind.  Yes you will hear some feedback on the equipment at certain points of the concert, but it is minimal.  With the wind blowing the way it did, you wouldn't even know it was from just listening to the recordings.  Therefore, I think a lot of credit should be given for to the production of this DVD from an audio standpoint.  The problem is with the editing of the concert.  First up, this is NOT the complete Knebworth concert.  There are selected highlights from each of the acts.  Most of the acts did around 6 to 8 songs. (I know this from following Tears For Fears very closely that they did other songs NOT included on the DVD set.)  On the DVD set, all of the acts will perform only 2 to 4 songs.  This set is well priced for what you get, but I think it would have been terrific if they offered a complete concert version as well.  This would help with the flow and continuity of the concert.  Continuity and flow are also affected due to the fact that the acts do not appear in the same order in which they actually performed.  Much of this had to do that this DVD set was originally a three volume VHS set that 'packaged' the concert into three parts.  However I find the re-ordering to really detract from the enjoyment. Much of the magic of a concert recording is watching it as you would have seen it.  It is a shame that this collection doesn't do that.

A synopsis of each act:

Tears For Fears: I'm biased here.  They are my favorite group and they don't disappoint.  They do three songs  - ""Change"", ""Badman's Song"", and ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"".  I know from listening to some bootlegs that they really were impacted by the weather, but watching this recording you wouldn't know it.  This is a top-notch performance and it was a great way for a great band to go out on top.

Cliff Richard and the Shadows:  My first reaction was 'Cliff Richard'?  But Cliff and the band are sensational.  Cliff Richard proves he still can rock performing ""On the Beach"", ""Good Golly Miss Molly"", and ""We Don't Talk Anymore"".  A highlight is a couple in the audience singing along to ""We Don't Talk Anymore"".

Phil Collins and the Serious Band: Phil's version of ""In the Air Tonight"" is sensational.  He starts by sitting down, then gets up mid-song and smacks the drums! He does ""Sussudio"" with his Phenix Horns section.

Paul McCartney: Has four songs.  The best of the four songs is ""Hey Jude"".  McCartney gets the whole crowd into this song.  McCartney's guitarist Robbie McIntosh is terrific on vocals as well - especially on ""Coming Out"".

Status Quo: Not a big fan of theirs.  I was surprised they got 4 songs, while bigger names had less.  The best song performed was ""Whenever You Want"".

Supergroup: First it's Eric Clapton, then Clapton is joined by Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits, then Elton John joins them.  Clapton does some very bluesy numbers .  Knopfler and Dire Straits and with Clapton do a terrific version of ""Solid Rock"".  They then do a new Straits tune called ""Then I Love You Too Much"".  Following that is a terrific version of ""Money For Nothing"" that has a bluesy like intro and a terrific ending.  The Elton John stuff really disappoints.  He has Knopfler and Clapton on stage and picks two tunes not making the most of their abilities - ""Sacrifice"" and ""Sad Songs""?  Also renowned background vocalist Tessa Niles is on stage for all 3 acts of the Supergroup.

Robert Plant: Starts out slow with ""Hurting Kind"".  Things pick up with ""Tall Cool One"".  Jimmy Page then joins him on stage for ""Wearing and Tearing"" and ""Rock and Roll"" and Page really puts on a show.

Genesis: They do a version of ""Mama"" in which Phil is in fine form with the evil laugh in the microphone.  ""Throwing It All Away"" is the version seen at many Genesis performances.  They then go into a sensational version of the ""Turn It On Again - medley"" that includes ""Turn It On Again"" and covers of some non-Genesis stuff.  What is cool about the medley is that Phil's band joins Genesis on stage for it - adding the horns section and making for some great entertainment.

Pink Floyd: They wrap up the collection.  Only two songs - ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" and ""Run Like Hell"".  Both songs feature some great special effects and sax player Candy Dulfer will steal the show with the first song.

The liner notes include a brief writeup on background behind the concert.  The acts and numbers they perform are listed.  There is also a very brief summary of each of the performances.  All of the musicians who participate are credited.  Despite some of the shortcomings, this is still one great performance.  I'd still recommend getting it because there isn't anything else out there that covers this concert of better quality.",1094860800,114,5524,4.516161616161616
1785219,5,B00006LPCX,"After so many reviews regarding the audio and video of this DVD I have to say that I don't have these problems with my copy.
Ok, the video it is mediocre (almost like a VHS or maybe a little more fuzzy) BUT the audio, (and I am referrring here to the DTS track) it's outstanding, this by no means degrade the entertainment factor of this DVD and it beats, in my opinion, having instead the VHS by far.
My copy was made in 2002 by ""eagle eye"" and it is region 1 (NTSC). If you find this DVD with this characteristics and you have a good receiver with a DTS decoder then don't even think twice and buy it. The performances are awesome and tight and it is worth the price, I'll guarantee it.",1089849600,7,688,4.141791044776119

especialy PINK FLOYDS ENTIRE CORE OF THERE PERFORMANCE LIKE WISH YOU WERE HERE SORROW AND THE BEST SONG,COMFORTABLY NUMB I THINK THEY SHOULD RE-RELEASE IT WITH MORE OF PINK FLOYD BECAUSE THATS THE BEST OF THE WHOLE SHOW WITHOUT THE ENTIRE PINK FLOYD SHOW THE DVD IS WORTHLESS AND ALSO THEY NEED TO SHOW MORE CLAPTON.PLEASE TELL THEM TO MAKE A SECOND DISK WITH MORE PERFORMANCES IT WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY AND IT WILL BE WORTH IT",1060041600,16,615,4.310344827586207
1785221,3,B00006LPCX,"This DVD is worth the money just because of Tears for Fears' ""Badman's Song,"" ""Change,"" Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's ""Wearing and Tearing,"" and Pink Floyd, but it sounds [bad]! I remember watching this concert on PPV and the memory of it made me buy the DVD, but it sounded so much better on the live broadcast than in the ""newly mixed 5.1"" version. There are thousands of volume drops throughout the two discs, and it's just generally poorly mixed. I tried several fixes for the volume drops, including putting the 5 channels of audio into a Yamaha O1v mixing console, and it didn't help. Then I tried gates and those didn't work either. Finally, I tried a limiter, and only boosting it to +10db and leaving the gate open, I was able to ""semi-fix"" it.
If you're an audiophile, try just buying the CD.
P.S. Status Quo is the British equivalent of Creedence Clearwater Revival or Georgia Satellites, and I think it's funny that the Brits also have redneck music.",1058745600,12,962,4.631578947368421
1785222,4,B00006LPCX,"As someone who was at the concert I can tell you that this video is about as good as being there.  It may actually be better since between sets there were huge food fights and by the time Pink Floyd took the stage it was very cold and rainy.  My only disappointment was that Genesis had chosen to include the old-timey rock and roll medley rather than one of the many great songs from their past.  It was also a treat to see and hear Page and Plant's first reunion since the break up of Led Zeppelin.
All in all a great souvenir.",1048464000,3,529,4.116504854368932
