927144,5,6304727127,"And so goes a Public Enemy rap song from the late 80's, as the ultra chic thief of the late 60's got immortalized on vinyl two decades later, and should continue to be an icon for decades more.  The coolest burglar in TV or movie history is none other than Robert Wagner, as Alexander Mundy.

Airing for 3 seasons from '68-'70, we got 66 episodes of espionage, heists, and of course, romance in exotic locales.  We got a cool theme song from Dave Grusin, spun over psychadelic opening montages, featuring 3 different opening tags through the three seasons.  In '68 you had Noah Bain, expertly played by Malachi Throne, uttering ""Look, Al, I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal.""  In '69 and into '70 it was Wagner responding with ""Let me get this straight, you WANT me to steal.""  And also in '70, there was none other than Alistair Mundy (Al's thief of a Dad) with ""I've heard of stealing from the government BUT FOR the goverment!""

When Malachi Throne departed during the '69 season, he was replaced by Ed Binns as Wally Powers, who was never as strict as Noah.  Noah made Al stay in a government monitored house, under close wraps, but Al was quickly roaming free under Wally.  While the 3rd season was a whole lot of fun, featuring Fred Astaire as Al's Dad, the shows never had as much pinache as some of the superb 1st and 2nd season hits, and one of my favorite shows in TV history was canceled far too early.

What made this show so grande was the performance of Robert Wagner, and the premise of the shows, where Al was sent in (almost always under an alias and spying in various disguises) to steal something, spy on someone, or protect something.  Who didn't want to emulate this globetrotting expert thief, who could steal things legally, sneak in and out of dangerous countries with the help of the US government, and seduce foreign diplomat's daughters.

There were numerous classic episodes, often with lots of swinging 60's style and humor, but one very tense and dramatic story I remember was the two part Hans Across the Border, where Al had to smuggle a defector out of East Germany in a vehicle's hidden compartment.  Great stuff, but the shows with biting humor were the best, like the one where Al posed as a Magician with an assistant, or the one when he was a photographer during a United Nations beauty contest, in the aptly named episode 38-23-36.

There wasn't a show as fun as this one, a leading man as suave as Al Mundy, or a premise as sweet as this.  It wasn't exactly a success at barely 3 seasons, but it should have gone on longer.  Many shows have tried to capture the thief gone good scenario, and until recently with the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Collar/dp/B002U0KHMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Collar</a>, we had gone many years where carbon copies of this show have failed.

***DVD Quality update***: Wow, I can't believe it's been 6 years since I initially wrote this, pining for a DVD release.  Now that it's finally out, many have complained of the picture quality.  Well, after finally getting my boxed set, I can honestly review the DVDs.  The clarity differs slightly with each episode you watch.  In some, there is a ton of graininess, and in others, the picture is clearer but the sharpness is low.  A few episodes have good picture quality and sharpness, however none are up to today's standards.  If you are a picky about image quality and like to watch everything in HD, this will be a strong disappointment to you.  However, if you are a fan of the show, and don't mind watching a lower quality picture, I don't think this becomes a deal breaker.  It is similar to watching a VHS quality tape, and for some episodes, it's like watching a 2nd generation VHS copy.  Hey, that's all we had back then and we still watched stuff, right?  It's up to you whether you think the price and quality are worth paying for, but I am glad to own the entire series.  It will stay in my collection and is still very watchable to me.

Video Tip:  Change your TV setting from ""wide"" to ""normal"" when viewing It Takes A Thief, as it will zoom out the picture to it's normal ratio, rather than enlarging and stretching it to fit your screen.  This will give the episodes slightly better sharpness.",1133654400,220,4317,4.663143989431968

927147,5,6304727127,"I agree with 'most all the other reviewers: this is one of the best TV entertainment experiences I've encountered. I watched it this afternoon and, when my husband came home, I watched it with him again.

How had I missed this series? How had my husband missed it? I'm so glad I stumbled across a copy at the library and fully intend to buy the whole series in DVD when it comes out. What a pleasure to see. From a purely nostalgic point of view, we got a kick out of the old cars, the groovy music and the hip fashions, not to mention identifying several actors whom we recognized from other shows from the era (we counted three from _Star Trek_ alone!).

But it's far more than nostalgia. Wagner is a splendid actor and his part must have been such a treat to have been able to perform. The plot and pacing are superb. Kudos to the writer of this clever, innocently sexy script. And the title music makes you hop on a plane to go tango somewhere!

I also liked Fred Astair as Mundy's father. They played off each other in a comedic way that was very entertaining. Of course, I'm also a Fred Astair fan. It's too bad that it was only on for 2 seasons, poor ratings.

The only reason I can think of, for not releasing the show to video/dvd, may be due to the fact that RW holds the rights to the series. Well, we can only hope.",1105747200,2,524,3.943396226415094

What I really appreciated was the very heartfelt 30 minute retrospective[described as an interview, but it's more of him alone addressing the viewer] by Robert Wagner on his fond connection with the series. He speaks highly of the people associated with the show, and the truly heartfelt sadness he expresses with so many of them now passed on. You can honestly tell he is as a true classy professional & a gentleman you rarely anymore in his profession. There is also a retrospective by Glenn Larson done in the same style about his association with the show that i found interesting and informative.

Instead, they are stuck in a strange little cardboard fold-out arrangement which is a mite difficult to wrestle the discs from, one folder for each season. Then the 3 folders are put into a square box that's much bigger than it needs to be, with the less-than-wonderful coasters and discs held in place by a wide cardboard spacer.

927430,5,6304727127,"""Look Al, I'm not asking you to spy.  Just...steal.""

A gem of series from the 1960's.  Not unlike the old Mission Impossible series in feel and substance, with a new, seemingly impossible caper each week, set in a different exotic locale.  The premise is similar to the new series, White Collar, with Robert Wagner as the jewel theif-turned-government-agent, Al Mundy, who risks life and limb on behalf of a shadowy government agency.  Usually, Mundy has to find and steal (recover) a precious gem, a stolen document, an atomic bomb, or even a beautiful princess, all the while proving his worth and trying to find ways to keep his nervous, skeptical boss, Noah Bain, from sending him back to the slammer.  Bain, played by Malachi Throne, is a sheer delight to watch.  He's never really sure about Mundy's sincerity or devotion to Uncle Sam's cause.  As the series progresses, though, his ""admiration"" for Mundy's unique skills (as a thief and as a woman's man) grows, and the chemistry between the two is hard to miss.

The third season was filmed entirely in Italy with Fred Astaire added to the cast as Al's father.  Most fans consider the third season the weakest of the three, but personally I thought some of the stories were extremely strong and well-thought out.

It's a lot of fun - lots of familiar TV faces pop up looking so young.  Oh, the jazz score is snappy, too.  Season One features a couple of very interesting interviews with Robert Wagner and Glen Larson, co-producer and frequent writer in the third season.",1396483200,,1529,4.768060836501901

927436,5,6304727127,"For everyone concerned about the picture quality of this set, please see the 2nd paragraph. I've been a huge fan of It Takes a Thief ever since watching it during my summer vacations in the late mornings. I was THRILLED when I first discovered Universal released the pilot film ""The Magnificent Thief"" on VHS in the 90's and was hoping for a full series. Sadly that wasn't the case and it would be an over 20 year wait. I had taped several episodes off TV but there were MANY holes in my collection. Needless to say I was OVERJOYED when Entertainment One announced the release of the set. It's great to finally have a FULL collection.
  To be upfront the picture quality isn't PERFECT on this set. Many of the reviews complained about the quality and they need to do a ""proper"" transfer and cleanup from the film masters. Sadly in 2008 a fire ripped through one of Universal's film vaults with many reporting destroyed tape assets, and unfortunately master film elements, It Takes a Thief was one of them. Several ""backup"" copies survived in different locations on tape in different formats, and all of the existing elements were gathered, evaluated and cleaned up as much as possible for this release. Unfortunately many of the transfers were old and in the European PAL video format and needed to be converted to the American standard, NTSC. Because of the PAL format's 25 frames per second, transfers from film to PAL seem ""sped up"" (about 4%) so those episodes used for this set sound a bit fast, as many people noted. Also there is only so much a studio can do when cleaning up tape-based masters without the picture further deteriorating, so sadly, unless technology improves this is most likely going to be the best we're going to get. I also have several friends overseas who checked out the region 4 releases, but sadly it's the same case on those as well. Understanding this, this is still a FANTASTIC set! It's great to re-live many of the episodes I remember as a kid and even being introduced to many more I've never seen before!

Created by Roland Kibbe, the program was a midseason replacement that premiered in January of 1968, and produced a total of 66 episodes.  Hitchcock's classic thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Catch-a-Thief/dp/B006OKOZGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Catch a Thief</a>&nbsp;(1955), supposedly provided the inspiration for Al Mundy, a cool, classy, and handsome gentleman crook and cat burglar.

Al Mundy is doing time in prison, when Noah Bain (Malachi Throne) of the SIA (Secret Intelligence Agency), a branch of US intelligence, springs him from behind bars, and presents him with a unique proposition.  In return for his parole, Mundy agrees to carry out missions for the SIA, utilizing his singular talents as a con artist, and master thief.  Initially, Mundy is placed under house arrest in a residence near Washington D.C., where he is watched on closed circuit TV, and supervised by various female SIA agents.  However, by the second season, Al had earned enough points to live on his own, unsupervised.

The premise of a man living in a gilded cage, while being forced to steal and engage in espionage, to preserve his freedom, is remarkably intriguing.  More so, because Al Mundy not a trained operative, and doesn't like guns or violence.  Appearing at the tail end of the ""spy craze"", following in the wake of programs like Mission Impossible, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., audiences were very familiar with kinds of stories presented on It Takes a Thief.  The big differences were that rather than a team or organization, the focus was mostly on just one man, and the series brings a comedic spin, to what are supposedly deadly serious missions.

Mundy's semi-adversarial relationship with Noah Bain, is also a key element in the series' appeal.  Constantly putting Al in danger, spoiling his fun, and threatening to send him back to prison, Malachi Throne adroitly plays a character that is sometimes hard to like.

From the start, realism was not a major concern, as the dashing charismatic Mundy operated with daring and style, in the face of great danger, though at times obviously trying much too hard to be cool.  Chaffing against the leash of his SIA handlers, while charming many a lovely young woman, Mundy assumes a multitude of roles, often involving impersonations, disguises, exaggerated accents, and inappropriate ""hipster"" lingo.  Gadgetry occasionally plays a role, but Mundy generally relies on his own unique skills to stay alive.

Generally featuring outlandish plots, and often set in fictional foreign lands, the series was shot on location, and also on the expansive Universal Studios lot.  The third season brought some major changes, as the production moved to Europe, and contractual issues led to Malachi Throne's departure.  The jet setting Mundy was now fully committed to the SIA, and was operating like a James Bond clone.  The loss of Throne was somewhat offset by the addition of the legendary Fred Astaire (1899-1987), in the reoccurring role of Mundy's father Alistair, another master thief.  After Throne's departure, Edward Binns most often assumed the role of Mundy's SIA contact.

The series featured an outstanding lineup of guest stars, including a continuous string of beautiful women.  It's tough for Al to get romantic with Bain and his SIA staff around, but when operating in the field, Mundy has more opportunities to employ his effusive charms.  Things rarely go smoothly, as there is usually a bit of friction between Al and his female partners, which typically makes for some spirited and entertaining adventures.

The series' musical theme by Dave Grusin is brilliant, and the show's musical score is lively and fun, and hopefully will be made available someday.  The eighteen disc set contains 66 episodes, plus the extended 89 minute version of the pilot, ""Magnificent Thief"".  Also included are interviews with Robert Wagner, and producer Glen A. Larson. Image quality of the series varies quite a bit.  Sometimes the show looks great, with good sharpness and color saturation, and other times the colors appear washed out, or shows signs of grain, or loss of sharpness.  The variable quality, is why this release rates 4.5 stars, rather than a full on 5 stars.

The set also includes a collectible film cell, and strangely, a set of unimpressive looking coasters.  The individual seasons are housed in separate fold out cardboard sleeve type cases.  The packaging leaves something to be desired, as the contents are housed in a flimsy oversized cardboard box.

While it has serious aspects, It Takes A Thief also has a lighter side, that makes for a change of pace from other series involving spies and espionage.  Al Mundy is an intriguing and extremely likeable character, and Roger Wagner is provided the opportunity to showcase his talents, working with a fabulous guest cast, in this lively classic 60's action/adventure.",1360022400,2,5242,5.392638036809816

They claim the episodes were ""digitally remastered,"" but I don't believe it. If they actually were, then it's the worst remastering in the history of DVD production.  The transfers are simply awful. The producers seem to have actively sought out the worst possible prints of each episode for the set. It's as if someone recorded the episodes off the air on VHS and then transferred them to DVD on their desktop computer. It's shoddy, especially for a set with this steep price tag. The interviews with Larson and Wagner are nice bonuses, as is the theatrical cut of the pilot (which *was* duped from a video cassette!).

Most are very good to top quality. 1 Episode from Season 1 ""Locked In Cradle Of Keep"" occasionally jumps but so did the syndicated ones when they were rerun****  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This has finally arrived- and it's taken long enough of a wait to come out on DVD. One of the best original series ever done for TV with Robert Wagner  as Alexander Mundy , Malachi Throne as Noah Bain, and Fred Astaire as Alister Mundy in the 3rd Season. Many episodes are in very good to outstanding quality, but some you can tell are just from the last done remastering stage for the way they have been running on TV.  I remember this show when it was on ABC-TV in the '60's.  Especially 3rd season shows: It would not hurt to get some of the film work cleaned up like how film is fixed today to get rid of film flaws that has been done: Just like  the James Bond movies the films were all cleaned up by LOWERY.  Another big dissapointment is that I know they had  a long version play- along with a short version play of the main TV Credits for all 3 seasons.  The longer versions of  the series credits seasons 2 and 1 -there is not one show in this set from either seasons #one or #two that has one show displaying a long version season running credit sequence.  Season 3 : towards the later second half of season 3 does have  the long credits in maybe half a dozen episodes but only the long credits for Season 3. This really made me dissapointed. In the long run, every episode is definitely in this set and that in itself is worth it. Remastering many frame by frame and getting the longer credits out on a newer remastering set in the future I would recommend. It Takes A Thief fans or not-buy this set. Great series. *****2-22-15: NEW INFO:  I found out from another on-liner that the Original Master Prints for IT TAKES A THIEF along with other shows were destroyed by a severe Warehouse Fire in the past, so this set may be the best we can get.

Then later on, his uncle ""David Niven"" must have taught him more in the classic ""The Pink Panther"". Finally, stealing for the U.S. government (legally?) had to be his crowning achievement.

If you've never seen it before but enjoy action adventure with a liberal sprinkling of humor and good fun, then check it out. If this show were to be made today, it would be ""White Collar.""",1347840000,3,672,4.471544715447155
927825,4,6304727127,"I bought my ""It Takes a Thief"" DVD set barely used, and saved considerable money in doing so. A fan since '70s reruns, I was quite curious to see how the picture quality here compared to over-the-air broadcasts, so much having been written in these reviews about faded color. Starting with the third season, where the problem was said to be the most noticable, I watched three episodes, marathon-style. And in every one, the colors were bold and bright, the picture definition as crisp as can be expected of any '60s era show. If anyone knows of episodes where the picture quality is especially bothersome, I'd like to have the titles, so I can compare them for myself.

My only complaint is in the amount of flecks and debree sprinkled throughout each episode, but especially in the beginning minutes. These are obviously NOT digitally remastered. Still, we're getting ""It Takes a Thief"", complete and uncut, and as has been noted elsewhere, the sound quality is excellent. This is great for savoring what is surely one of the best TV theme songs of all time!

As I've said over and over again in my other reviews, as well as in my comments, DO NOT watch these old '60s/'70s shows on large, flat screen hi-definition TVs. Unless they have been digitally remastered, there is not enough picture information, even in 35mm prints, to meet the demands of the newer sets. Instead, keep an older tube-style TV around, one with a screen size no greater than 19 inches. These are the kind of TVs that such old shows were intended to be viewed on, and will still deliver the best picture, all things considered.

As for the packaging itself, I thought the outer box was ridiculously large for what it needed to hold, and would never fit in my jam-packed DVD shelves anyway. So out it went. The individual season packs are self-supporting enough to stand on their own without this additional bulk. The disks themselves are studio pressings, as opposed to burned in DVD-Rs, so problems with performance and longevity have been minimized. They are attractively labeled, with a listing for the episodes on each disk, thereby allowing easy referance. My only concern is that the protective cardboard jackets holding the disks have a coarse inner surface, which might lead to scratching. Insert or remove with care!

And I think I'm the only one out there who actually LIKES the coasters. They are attractive, impervious to water damage, and are nice to have nearby, as I relax with a cold one in my hands, watching...What else? ""It Takes a Thief""!",1345248000,6,2534,4.7785388127853885

927887,4,6304727127,"I bought this recently and it arrived well ahead of schedule.  I've been watching the discs for a bit now although I haven't finished them, and found them to be very good quality for a show from the 1960s.

They are a little bit odd on the extras - there is a disc with an interview with Robert Wagner and and interview with Glen Larson as well as an expanded version of the pilot ""Magnificent Thief"" all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The package came with a Senitype of Robert Wagner as Al Mundy which is a nice little collectors item and a set of coasters.  The coasters I didn't really understand - it was like they needed to throw something else in the package to make it marketable.  Personally I would have preferred more interviews and commentaries on the various episodes.  Oh well, that's just me.  There was also a booklet which had additional information on the show which I appreciated.  I guess the coaster was the only thing I found odd.

There isn't much in the way of video noise or audio noise which I found refreshing.  It is a series from the 1960s so allowances are made.  The audio is mono and it looks like it was done in Technicolor, but I knew this going in since I watched the series when it aired in the 1960s.  I've been a fan of Robert Wagner for a long time, though haven't always appreciated all of his work.  This series does not disappoint.

All in all it was a purchase that was well worth the money.  Speaking of which, I received a promotion in my email to get this series for a reduced price.  When I looked at the price online it was a little higher.  I contacted Amazon though and they credited the difference back to me.

For the cost of this product this poor quality is just inexcusable.  Other Universal series from this era, e.g., the early Columbo episodes are fine.  In general the colors here are faded and light.  However, the right and left 10-15% of many of the prints are EXTREMELY FADED; blacks are blue/greenish, with an abrupt transition towards the center of the frame.

The people who put this set out should not have wasted money on the stupid and flimsy box (are you freakin' kidding - who needs It Takes a Thief drink coasters!!! -  AND I don't mean the poor DVDs are coasters, they actually include carboard coasters) and done some BASIC remastering of the prints.

927893,5,6304727127,"Many other reviewers have already written detailed and insightful comments on the quality of the show itself, so I won't duplicate that.  I do want to comment on the discussion regarding the quality of the disks.

Yes, it's true that some episodes have that classic faded-out, washed out look you sometimes see in film from the 1960s-70s, and I agree that I would have preferred a more compact package instead of the over-sized box and silly extras (e.g., coasters).

That said, the less-than-perfect quality hasn't diminished my enjoyment one bit!  Perhaps it depends on what kind of TV viewer you are. If you're the type who hangs back and critiques the cinematography, the washed out color may very well annoy you. If, on the other hand, you're the type who allows yourself to get caught up in the flow of the story, the quality is perfectly fine.

The first two seasons (or one-and-a-half, really, since it started as a mid-season replacement show) comprise some of the best TV viewing of all time, IMHO.  In the third season some of the energy was sucked out (mostly due to the loss of Noah Bain but also because they traded the mod urban vibe for a laconic Mediterranean paradise feel in many episodes), but even then it was very good. Not as great as seasons 1 and 2 but still very, very good.

In short, if you loved this show back in the day and you're the type of viewer to pay more attention to the narrative than the technicalities, don't let the negative reviews here scare you off. There is more than enough great fun to be found in this boxed set!",1329523200,8,1562,4.557142857142857

This 18 disk, 66 episode set is over 5o hours of entertainment. It also has a reproduced 35mm  film cell (senitype) and four coaster set with a book with an essay regarding the show, The cell and the coasters as nice as they are are fluff for special collectors. the DVDs are real prize here . Who want the crackerjack prize when this show is a crackjack of a great television!

This was Robert Wagner's first salvo into TV. Wagner embodied the chatacter of  Al Mundy. He  was cool, slick and hip. He ran with the jet set and the high rollers. He was a class act. He was Cary Grant, Burt Lancaster and Fred Astaire rolled into one man.

On a personal note, this is one of my favorite TV classics along side MacGyver, The Man from UNCLE, Classic Star Trek and Blackadder. As good as this is, this show is a treasure for TV addicts everywhere. I am glad that Eone put this is one single collection unlike CBS who is drawing out the Perry Mason episodes on DVD.

As the tag line says, the SIA (our government) hired (well springing him from Prison) Mundy to steal for the government of course. Some sort of state secret or safe he needed to crack. He ends up spying anyway!

Malachi Throne plays the ""cop"" that busted Al, Noah Bain. Noah is his handler, never his friend. This odd couple relationship of boss and thief worked for the first two season. I wish it would have been working on the weakest season, the third (and final) season as well...Throne was not invited to be in the third season. I blame it on network and the producers trying to fix the show and move the locations to europe.

One of the highlights of the third season was Al Mundy's father played by Fred Astaire. he was in only five episodes, don't miss those five. Season three boasted a guest cast of movie stars and famous  names as Bette (Madame Sin) Davis, Elsa Lanchester, Peter Sellers, Aldo {Thunderball} Celi, and Tom Smothers (in a racing episode) guest starred. The first two seasons guest cast was good, but not great! It has performers like Senta Berger, Sharon Acker, Joseph Cotton, Susan Saint James, Fernando Lamas, Gavin MacLeod (yes Before the Love Boat-he played villians and heavys) and Ricardo Montalban.

Edward Binns took over for Throne in season three. He was not as hard nosed as Throne. He wavered a lot. It spoiled the interplay that Noah Bain has over Al.

The story editor and producer for most of the series was Glen Larson. Yes, that is the same Glen Larson who created and produced such TV shows as  Knight Rider, Magnum PI, the classic Battlestar Galactica and The Fall Guy. His writing was created and inventive. His script  writing was over 19 shows, about a third of the series..but you can see his hand in other episodes.

These 66 episodes are great entertainment.... the retro channel still runs these episodes, cut to ribbons with many many ads  on saturday night. Those great people at Eone who did a great job on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ellery-Queen-Mysteries/dp/B003RHZ6CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ellery Queen Mysteries</a>&nbsp;box set has done it again. these episodes and the original pilot episode (Magnificent Thief) is restored to its orginal brillance. These disk  could be aired today the way these disk look today..the Masters are crisp and clear as any show from the late 1960 would be.

Two great extras on this box set are the  great insightful interviews--one with Robert Wagner and the other with Glen Larson. Both reveal the personal side of the series. This is longest interview I have seen of Robert Wagner talking about Thief.

So you better buy it now, ITS A STEAL!

927947,5,6304727127,"I just felt i had to defend The ""It Takes A Thief Box Set. Many reviewers are stating that the box set itself is badly or cheaply made. That statement is about 10% true. In my humble opinion, this is a very very nice box set. I literally have at least 30 various box sets, all with good, great, and bad designs. This one is a little on the weak side physically, but it is NOT cheaply made. Click on the picture, which allows you to zoom in on the set. Its got style, and is in a class all its own. Inside is the coaster set. Their nice cardboard coasters with very high quality print/Art work. Also within the set theres what looks like a piece of the film, Its about one inch by one inch, its mounted in a nice cardboard frame with similar artwork. And the booklet is printed in nice 4-color print. The artwork and colors are vivid. The box set looks excellent on display in my collection. Its stands right out from the rest. The discs are all in separate pre-cut sleeves within the fold out cardboard holders for each season. Lots of nice high quality pictures with-in the Disc holders. I could complain that each DVD slides into a cardboard slot, but the whole issue with this set is to just go slow, Its a very shiny, slippery type surface, and does not do any damage to the discs if you take your time and pay attention to what you are doing. And honestly, how many times do you think you will be removing each disc. Most people with a box set of this size will certainly watch the show, and maybe even succeed at watching every show. But my guess is that same disc might come out 5 times in your whole life. As for the picture quality. I personally cant say cause i haven't watched yet. Ill come back and write more on that after the fact. Most people in the Amazon Reviews seem to say that the first season looks great, the second season looks good, but that the third season doesn't look as good, but is definitely watchable. Since the show was made in the old days, its probably best to buy this on DVD and not Blu Ray. [If it ever does come out on Blu Ray]. Blu Ray might be too revealing of the films flaws. Even high def television are not ideal for a TV show from the 60s, [which seems to have got a little kicked around over the decades.] This probably looks perfect on a high quality Enhanced definition TV. Remember them? EDTV. I think its 420p. Perfect for this show. You cant beat the price right now either. Its really worth 100.00. To each his own, but its a nice set, and with a different frame of mind this can become your favorite new box set.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:to my original review.--------------------------Well I'm back, I scanned the first episode of each season. On season one, first episode, the mono sound was excellent and clear. The picture quality is a bit grainy ""but only in ""some"" of the darker scenes"". There was minor small specks of dirt spots and scratches flying by. The colors are proper and can be made more vivid with your TVs color button in settings. Daylight, and inside lit scenes look great. Season Two looked and sounded as good as season one. With season three the sound was as good as the other seasons. I noticed that the picture quality on season three was very passable and watchable. The difference with season three is that at the very beginning when the show first begins, there is more dirt specs and scratches than usual. It does clear up within 20 seconds or so. This season seems to have had less protection over the years but is still very watchable. You should also realize that this release marks the first time this show has ever been released on DVD. Usually this is the best you will see this because if it doesn't sell good than the rights will either go out of print or fall to a cheaper company that won't put the care into it that this company did. That happens a lot. They re-released the Monkees show again a few months back and the 2nd generation is a no frills pile of junk compared to the first release in those box sets that look like record players. If your on the fence about this you really don't need to be. I know you will be happy buying this. It is worth the 100.00. From Mike in Plymouth Ma. Hope this helps.",1326326400,8,4359,4.54002541296061
927948,5,6304727127,"As I sit here writing this review while drinking a martini resting on my It Takes a Thief coaster that came with the DVD's as well as a senitype of one frame from the show, I remember that the last time I saw this series I was nine or ten. Forty years later I get to see it again and this time in colour, as last time I was watching on a black and white TV.This was also the first time I had seen Robert Wagner  act in anything and also Fred Astaire.
This is a great TV series with big name guest stars in every episode. This series is so cool as are the characters. The show is fast-paced and intriguing with it's tongue slightly in it's cheek. Each episode is a gem. You could not make a series like this today as they would make it too campy or so  confusing you would need a masters degree to figure it out. Also you can't teach cool. You've either got it or you haven't and nobody today does cool. Not even George Clooney. Even fashion today is not as cool. Cars,clothes etc.
Money was thrown at this series and it shows in every frame. After seeing this show again I now know that this is my favourite Robert Wagner series .Why it only lasted three seasons is a mystery in itself as it was cancelled while still high in the ratings to the surprise of Robert Wagner and the fans. It was a corporate decision to do so. Did the show become too costly to produce or was there another reason. In the final season the series took on a darker tone,especially on the last three episodes. Could the answer lie in the last episode ""Project X"" which was very political about how big business treats the environment,even with the actor turning to the camera to give the final speech. I don't know the answer and it isn't mentioned in the interviews with Robert Wagner or Glen A Larson the writer and producer of the show.
But at least now I have the entire series thanks to Entertainment One who Have done an excellent job. I have read other reviews where the comments are less than flattering but I found nothing wrong with my set. Everything looked great to me. Although I am watching on an ordinary DVD player and not Blu-Ray.",1326153600,4,2123,4.265508684863524
927949,4,6304727127,"A classic TV series that saw considerable syndication that was probably more successful than its original run ""It Takes a Thief"" Robert Wagner's TV series finally arrives on DVD in a set that includes the complete original run series.

Wagner plays talented thief Alexander Mundy sprung from prison (sound familiar to you fans of ""White Collar""?) by government agent Noah Bain (the marvelous Malachi Throne)to ""steal"" things for the Secret Intelligence Agency.

Featuring some terrific guest stars including the late Fred Astaire as Mundy's father (and a final season with episodes shot on location in Europe), the series was a popular fixture on ABC and although it was never a huge hit for the network the appeal of Wagner, the often breezy scripts and top notch acting helped keep the series on air. Wagner and Throne had great onscreen chemistry and when Throne left the series the show suffered for it.

Entertainment One has done a nice job with the series. Although remastered the series doesn't look quite as good as other vintage TV shows but still beats many of the others that have arrived on DVD. Colors look pretty good overall although they aren't quite as bold and detail isn't quite as strong as I had hoped. It's possible this may be an older transfer prepared for the Hulu and other online viewing so, perhaps, a stronger restoration attempt wasn't made here. Either way, fans will be satisfied for the most part with the look of the show as they are largely clean, clear and have nice color.

It is difficult to tell but I suspect some of these are the syndicated cuts based on the running time of the episodes.

The original mono audio appears (on first viewing) unaltered but I don't have the original to syndicated version to compare it with.

Although I could have done without the collectable box along with a senitype, a 35mm frame featuring Wagner's image. I really didn't need the set of four drink coasters although the full-color booklet with the informative essay by Dean Brierly is much appreciated. The packaging includes information on the original air dates for the episodes

We get ""The King of Thieves"" a 30 minute interview with star Wagner about the series as well as a 30 minute interview with writer/producer Glen A. Larson who worked on the series under the clever punning title ""A Matter of Larceny"".

The pilot is presented in its longer theatrical running time (it was released theatrically in Europe)and we also get the original U.S. TV version (which runs over 20 minutes less). The stylish direction by Leslie Stevens (""The Outer Limits"" and TV's  ""Buck Rogers"")along with the script make the pilot movie and its expanded version a big plus for this set.

Although the writing on some episodes hasn't aged quite as well as I'd hoped, the show still remains delightfully fun to watch even in these instances due to Wagner's breezy appealing performance and Throne's marvelous performance as Bain. The image quality isn't perfect but this is probably about the best the show has looked without a full restoration.

For fans of the series this is recommended.",1325376000,5,3103,4.869070208728653

The packaging is cheap, negligent, and IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT THE ITEMS.  Did someone design the cheap cardboard outer box while not realizing there would be no inner covers for the disc sets? So there is 50% AIR.  It doesn't look like any other first-rate boxed set.

But I do go on about this tacky protection and appearance.  I do confirm the other reviewers' main observations about the poor quality of the videos.  Much older, fuzzier series have been digitally remastered with skill and care to look much better than this.  There are many, many techniques and tools to produce DVD's from old film and tape.  Too bad this producer/distributor did not care to put out a fitting quality tribute to the series.  Some of the discs appear to have no remastering at all.",1325116800,60,912,4.64375
927952,3,6304727127,"""It Takes A Thief"" is a bit dated and probably only of interest to those who recall watching it years ago. The 1968-1970 ABC show was inspired by Cary Grant's debonair jewel thief in the film ""To Catch A Thief"".  Professional thief Alexander Mundy (Robert Wagner) gets an offer to work for the SIA (a covert U.S. government spy agency).  Mundy does not simply dismiss the offer out of hand as he is doing time and the government is offering him limited freedom (house arrest confinement in a Washington mansion between missions) in exchange for allowing them to utilize his considerable skills as a thief.

While not on the level of classics like ""77 Sunset Strip"", the show's first two seasons followed the wonderful tradition of 1960's action/adventure/spy shows by casting a different hot ""young"" starlet in each episode (except episodes 1.12, 2.11, 2.12, 2.14 & 2.15).  The show went strangely gay for its third and ""final season"", replacing this practice with evocative shots of Robert Wagner and in the process losing its original audience.

The set includes all 65 regular episodes and two versions of the pilot episode.  Despite complaints, the packaging I received was not bad, much better that the standard Mill Creek release.  Each season has its own folder with individual pockets for each disc. Although the flimsy square paper box that is the main package is completely useless.  Resolution is decent for the first two seasons, but since most older viewers first saw this as a grainy ABC broadcast, the resolution might cause an even more nostalgic reaction.

The resolution is generally the worst on the Season Three episodes but those episodes were staggeringly moronic and completely lacking in eye candy, so the poor film stock or generational video dubbing did not ruin anything of any quality.  The third season episodes are bad but not bad enough to work as mockfest material. Watch for the steady parade of ancient actresses with mega makeup, perhaps they provided the financing to keep things going for another week in exchange for the opportunity to take a working vacation at some exotic foreign location and a chance to encourage Wagner to unbutton his shirt a bit more.  Fortunately the first two seasons provide enough entertainment to justify the price, even if you simply trash the third season.

DVD set extras are a booklet, a 4-piece coaster set (why?) and interviews with Robert Wagner (he is not asked if he killed Natalie) and with Glen Larson.  Larson was associated with the series for its entire run, mostly as an associate producer but occasionally as a writer, particularly during season three.  In fact, when you find a particular episode especially boring it is a fair bet that it is one that Larson wrote.  It is believed that he was the Coen Brothers' model for the Digby Sellers character in ""The Big Lebowski"".

But I am glad I did because I found the Video to not be as bad as I had expected.
Some episodes are very good in quality others are not so great. I found more of the 1st season eps. to be of better quality in general. The ones that exhibited poor quality were of faded color and dirt with lines from the film transfer. There is also on the bad ones pixelation artifacting ... however I was surprised that the picture was very sharp where many poor transfers usually are blurry. It does not seem evident that these were re-mastered to restoration.. although they might have with some of the first season eps.? But It's like going through an old slide collection.. some of the ones the color fades others look better.. It is the case with this DVD box Set. I love the show and find the episodes watchable. Sure I would have preferred a pristine quality restored product.. but at least I can watch the show which I didn't get a chance to see all the episodes when they aired eons ago...  I have seen some really bad DVD transfers like Room 222 this set is way better in quality. I like the fact that the picture has really good sharpness.. even though the rest of the picture quality on varied episodes are color faded and dirty.
Overall if you are a fan or like the show ... I personally recommend it.

Inspired by Hitchcock's  Cary Grant film, To Catch a Thief, this popular television series lasted two-and-a-half seasons in the late 60's.  Starring Robert Wagner as Alexander Mundy, It Takes a Thief was a Bond-like adventure/spy series with plenty of mystery, intrigue, humor, and romance. Multiple guest star appearances by many familiar faces such as Fred Astaire, Susan Saint James, and Ricardo Montalban and more add to the sense of nostalgia and fun. The complete series is now available in a collectible box, containing all 66 episodes on 18 discs, the extended version of the pilot film, interviews, and more.

I was not around for the original airing of the series, but found the show charming and Robert Wagner as irresistible as ever. As a fan of the early Bond films, I couldn't help but compare, and was hooked from the pilot.  USA Network's White Collar obviously borrowed heavily from this series, though adapted for today's world. It Takes a Thief is a fantastic look back at the 60s espionage/adventure days with a young and dashing Robert Wagner.

928031,3,6304727127,"This is my edited review, having gone back and watched the set.

If one can get past the costumes and hairdos of the women -- and the attitudes -- this is still a very watchable series.  The plots and writing are quite good.  It used a lot of well-known actors as guest starts when it was made.

If you are younger and liked Leverage, then you may like this series.  Leverage was sort of a cross between the original Mission Impossible, which began in 1966, and It Takes a Thief, which started in 1968.  Leverage just added a lot of electronics, modern devices, and let the women actually be competent.

These shows are like all the shows of their ilk, a caper must be performed, something goes wrong -- or does it? -- the characters complete the caper anyway.  Even though all of these shows and movies follow the same formula, what makes them watchable is how they are put together, acting, directing, writing, photography, sets, location scenes, etc.

It Takes a Thief did it right, and it is still entertaining today.

MISSING SCENES!!

One problem, though.  The Eone people put the pilot on Disc 1 of this set in an edited format.  It runs about an hour and five minutes.  The complete pilot ""movie"" is available free on IMDB.com. It runs about 99 minutes.  If they were just trying to save disc space, why not just put the pilot on a separate disc and charge a couple dollars more?  If they didn't have a full print, then why bother to include it at all?  Or, why not obtain one?  It is obviously available or IMDB.com wouldn't have it.

Most of what was cut isn't too important, until the story suddenly jumps from Al discovering a dead girl (played by Susan St. James), fights with her killer, then suddenly the next scene features the Noah character (Malachi Throne) looking at some spears and saying that the break in was reported last night and the ""signature"" is that of Al.  Then we see Al trying to open a bunch of spears and riding to the top of a pavilion on a ""scoreboard"" like device.  Huh?  What for?

He then finds -- as Alfred Hitchcock said -- the McGuffin -- and soon the pilot episode ends.

Watch it on IMDB.com and it will make sense.

Too bad about the lack of quality and missing scenes.

Here is the email for Eone if you want to complain:

As many other reviewers have pointed out, transfer quality is very low. Frankly, I expected almost the same quality of other shows on DVD such as ""Mannix"", ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Mcmillan and Wife"", etc.
In addition to that, lack of English subtitles is a disadvantage not only for hard of hearing customers but also for not English speaking natives. Some pre-release information stated that ""It takes..."" would come with English subtitles.
Certainly for Mr. Wagner and Al Mundy fans this is better than nothing, but potential customers must be warned that this is not a digital remasterization. Or maybe it is: a poor transfer from  VHS to DVD. Let's hope a real restoration for the BR edition! Anyway, thanks for the effort of making available this cool and very long expected release.

But later episodes (Season Three, for instance) has the fuzzy look of a transfer from a second or third generation VHS tape.  Perhaps the original prints were not available or were damaged... but these discs were almost certainly mastered from old video tape sources.  The packaging is unfortunate also: cardboard sleeves (not a more durable plastic) in a flimsy, bulky (and mostly empty) cardboard box that will take up too much space on your media shelf.  The set comes with a pack of 4 cardboard drink coasters (seriously), a frame of 35mm film, and a booklet with some pictures and a brief fluff piece about the show.

I couldn't tell as I haven't seen the show for many years, but it's odd that it would run just one hour and a minute long.  Also, no music over the end credits.  Very strange.  Image-wise, this episode doesn't look too bad, though it is a little soft looking.  Episodes 2-4 don't appear to be time compressed though episode 4 is taken off of a substandard video master that has a lot of ghosting in the image.  It's really tiring seeing some really great old television getting no respect on DVD.  CBS/Paramount will often provide great transfers for most of their shows, but some of these other labels are really slip-shod.  I wish Universal would quit farming out their shows to these low-grade producers and for once go back to the original film elements and provide first rate transfers.  Also, the packaging for IT TAKES A THIEF is really cheap and flimsy.  Standard DVD cases would have been preferable.  I haven't had the chance to watch any other episodes, but the first 4 are a real mixed bag.  OK at best.",1321488000,68,1274,4.5506607929515415
928099,2,6304727127,"Most, if not all, of the 5 star reviews are several years old, lobbying for the release.  Sadly, the reality is considerably less than 5 star quality.

I've been waiting for this on DVD for years.  The eOne set was announced, and I kept an eye on the release date like Al and Alistair would keep an eye on diamonds.  The set arrived yesterday.

'Digitally re-mastered'?  Hardly.  The episodes on Hulu were of higher quality.  Specks, static, etc.  on every episode watched or looked at so far.  No idea what these were manufactured from, but they are not *remotely* re-mastered.  Color balance varies widely in each episode.  The video quality is on a par with 10-15 year old well cared for VHS recordings.

Second season theme is incomplete.  I know the full 60 second S2 intro is out there, because I've seen it intact (rarely, I'll admit, but it is out there) on brief syndication runs.  Not on every episode, true, but at least one or two, so it does exist.  No excuse for it not to be used here.

So far, third season is also using the abbreviated version of the theme on about half the episodes.  Again, no excuse.

The 'Special Feature' film version of the pilot was dubbed from the VHS release years back: the disclaimer about ""copying this VIDEOTAPE is prohibited,"" and ""This VIDEOTAPE is for private use only"" (emphasis added) is intact and displays before the opening credits.

The packaging is flimsy at best, awkward at worst.  The Special Feature Interviews with Robert Wagner and Glen Larson are nice to watch, but the quality of episode transfers and lack of substantial extras make this one a 2, and that's only due to my affection for the series overall.  It's nice to have un-edited and complete episodes to watch when the mood strikes, but one has to wish eOne had done things right and proper.

There are some nice extra's in the box including a stack of It Takes a thief drink coasters and a nice copy of a film frame picturing Robert Wagner.

The series was kicked off with a pretty good made for T.V. movie pilot called Magnificent Thief which obviously had a good size budget for the times. Although the three young ladies assigned to watch Al while he is in 'government' custody did not roll over into the series Al still gets plenty of play with the ladies. One of the things I really like about Wagner's character of Mundy is that he is absolutely fallable, but somehow finds a way around problems he faces so as to get the job done proving he is more than just a B&E man. A great series and a great time period to look back on before there were household computers, cell phones etc. and see how in the pre-digital world it took a man with real wits, creativity and exotic tools to get the job done.",1320969600,,1304,4.326530612244898

Robert Wagner, always one of the coolest actors in TV and film, played a top notch thief captured by the US government and forced to undertake missions of importance or go to prison.

As opposed to White Collar, Alexander Mundy was mostly on his own once put into the field. He excelled at picking pockets, locks, safes, and the heartstrings of the women he ran into. One of his handlers biggest challenges was keeping female agents out of seduction's way. They never seemed to be working too hard themselves to avoid that fate! LOL

The plots and sets are a bit simple by today's standards, but stand up well enough, carried more than adequately by Robert Wagner's innate charm. Later in the series, Fred Astaire was added as his father, and those shows are also a lot of fun.

Wagner plays Alexander Mundy, jewel thief extraordinaire with an eye for the ladies. Wagner brings vulnerability to the role and then adds his killer charm, that mixture of smooth, suave, sophisticated with just a dash of deadly when he needs it.

Mundy is paroled/recruited by a secret U.S. intelligence organization (SIA) to pull off assignments that not even their best agents can. As Mundy's SIA boss Noah Bain, played by actor Malachi Throne, says ""Oh look Al, I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal."" Always under threat he will be sent back to prison if he doesn't take on each dangerous assignment and give it his all--Mundy does and the show modulates from sassy to sexy to scary as he is immersed in spy and counter-spy intrigues and impossible capers.

928202,5,6304727127,"Fans are sure to rejoice with the news that the late 1960's iconic Classic TV series, It Takes a Thief, which starred Robert Wagner as the suave cat-burglar-turned-U.S.-secret-agent Alexander Mundy, will FINALLY be released on DVD in a complete series boxed set.

The series was based on Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 Classic Film, ""To Catch a Thief,"" which starred the perfect cast of sophistication and beauty: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. (FYI: The series was NOT based on the 1950's film, ""It Takes a Thief,"" as some websites have said.) The TV series title refers to the famous saying which was at the heart of the Grant-Kelly film: ""It Takes a Thief to Catch a Thief.""

It Takes a Thief was a January replacement show for ABC, premiering Jan. 9, 1968, and running two-and-a-half seasons through March 23, 1970. It aired Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., E.S.T., and became a huge hit for the network, as well as propelling movie star Wagner into megastar status.

E1 has said the 66 episodes that comprise the ENTIRE series, and are all included in this boxed set, have been remastered from original source material, and have promised a pristine transfer of the video and audio.

Wagner's Mundy was a professional cat burglar of world renown who had style, class and talent. After many years of successful thievery, he was finally arrested and sentenced to a long term of incarceration inside the fictitious San Jobel Prison. Quite unexpectedly, he was contacted while in jail by a secret U.S. government spy agency called the ""S.I.A.""

Mundy strikes a deal with American agent Noah Bain: A full pardon if Mundy uses his pilfering skills to steal for the American espionage agency. Technically under house arrest, Mundy travels all over the world performing daring acts of thievery in the name of Uncle Sam. He is closely monitored, especially by department director Bain, played to perfection by the fabulous and well-known Classic TV actor, Malachi Throne.

Bain essentially acted as Mundy's boss, providing him with government assignments. As the series progressed, Bain evolved from a watchdog into an aide, associate, then close friend.

Mundy traveled to exciting worldwide locales and had equally exciting adventures, while remaining under house confinement unless on the job. It wasn't until the second season that he was actually freed. The show was filmed in the glamorous world locales where Mundy plied his trade on behalf of Uncle Sam, adding authenticity and pizazz rarely seen on TV.

In the final season of the show, Mundy occasionally enlisted the help of his fabulously charming, debonair, and equally light-fingered father, and mentor, Alistar Mundy, played unforgettably by the beyond-legendary Fred Astaire. Astaire's character's name employed a letter play on his real last name.

In 1969, Bain was gone from the show, replaced by Agent Wally Powers, portrayed by Edward Binns.

There were 66 episodes in all. Throne appeared in 42 episodes, 1968-1969; Binns appeared in, 10 episodes, 1969-1970; classic film star Joseph Cotten, portrayed Mr. Jack, for five episodes, 1968-1970; Astaire appeared in five Episodes, 1969-1970; and Susan St. James, in all of her wide-eyed glory, portrayed secretary-turned-sidekick Charlene ""Chuck"" Brown in five Episodes, 1968-1970.

Viewers heard the following at the start of each episode:

Noah's voiceover: ""We're not asking you to spy. We're just asking you to steal.""
Alistar's voiceover: ""I've heard of stealing from the government, but for the government?""

I will not bore readers here by listing the titles other than the first season's 16 episodes: A Thief is a Thief (a.k.a. Magnificent Thief); It Takes One to Know One; When Boy Meets Girl; A Very Warm Reception; One Illegal Angel; Totally By Design; When Thieves Fall In; A Spot of Trouble; When Good Friends Get Together; Birds of a Feather; To Steal a Battleship; Turnabout; The Radomir Miniature; Locked in the Cradle of the Keep; A Matter of Royal Larceny; and The Lay of the Land.

Guest stars over the run of the series were the creame de la creame of that era's popular actors, including: Gavin MacLeod, Fernando Lamas, Sharon Acker, Don Knots, Stuart Margolin, Ricardo Montalban, Tina Sinatra, Peter Mark Richman, Barry Sullivan, Teri Garr, Georg Stanford Brown, Keye Luke, Wally Cox, Barry Williams, and Foster Brooks.",1311292800,28,4334,5.1290780141843975

Instead I got very cheap dvd-r copies with lousy sound, picture, and a very poor product overall. There are all sorts of pops, clicks, picture dropouts, and incomplete episodes. THIS COMPANY IS NOTHING BUT A PACK OF THIEVES. A junior high school student with good quality tapes could have burned superior copies of the series.

I will be the first in line to get my hands on these shows. I was only able to catch a couple episodes on TV about 15 years ago and was able to record them onto VHS but they are very low quality and not much fun to watch in the grainy condition they are in. This was one of the best series on TV then and I believe anyone of any age would love to get their hands on these shows. Its time these studios start catering to us baby boomers and give us back the shows from our childhood that we all loved.

George Clooney would be a much better choice. I predict that a remake of this great TV show will get screwed up like ""Lost in Space"", ""I Spy"" and ""The Wild Wild West"".

Yes, it might have been a little over the top, but the idea of living in a hot pad, taking exotic trips, being a master thief and getting the girl was tempered just the right amount by working for the government.  The ""Noah"" episodes were the best, but every episode had enough ""cool"" to keep me coming back for more.

I'm discouraged that this isn't on DVD yet and fear it never will be.  This is an iconic series with the right guy at the right time playing the lead.  I still have hope!",1203033600,2,547,4.074766355140187

928275,5,6304727127,"It Takes a Thief was a mid season replacement on the ABC network. I think it was replacing The Invaders. As an earlier reviewer commented ITAF was like the American version of The Saint. The show was smart,plots are always complex requiring Mundy's specialty - to steal something or someone. As always the humor was the most important part of the show. The show became much darker in its last season. The loss of Noah Bain was a big part of it,the interplay between Mundy & Bain was essential to the show. This show is better than the 2 later series Wagner appear in (Switch & Hart to Hart). So come on Universal bring on the dvds!!!
Well finally order my set from Amazon and just completed watching the entire series season 1 & 2 are very good in term of picture quality and story plots the 3rd season as most viewers who have seen in is lower in picture sharpness it look as if transferred from a vhs source. However, season 3 looks exactly like it on my cable channel antenna tv could it be E-1 could not locate the original source to master it from? That being said it still great to have it on dvd the Wagner & Larson interviews were great just wish Malachi Throne was included also since he is still alive all in all five stars!",1184976000,5,1234,4.323275862068965
928350,5,6304727127,"This prototype pilot that staged the scenarios that would compose the famous mid 1960's television show was well written, filmed and acted. Originally entitled: ""Magnificent Thief"", Robert Wagner gave perhaps the best performance in what was to be his most well known and Emmy nominated role as expert in Theft, Alexander Mundy. The television series, which ran on Thursday nights, had a good time slot and continues to intrigue people even today due to excellent writing and actors who starred in the show. The character eventually extricates himself from the slavery of working for the Government due to the intervention of his father, Alastair Mundy, played by Sir fleet of foot, Fred Astaire. A total departure from what you would expect and it worked like a charm! Astaire was believable and both he and Wagner worked as if they were a real father/son franchise. Malachi Throne added his down to earth, serious personality to the role of Noah Baine and even after he left the series his ""presence"" remained. The show lasted a bit longer than the usual for programs of the era. It does reflect the 60's in Austin Powers fashion but it won't get in the way of holding your interest in the stories. Of course, this needs to be issued in DVD and I predict a considerable interest is out there that will buy it when it becomes a reality.",1179532800,2,1337,4.742489270386266

The scene that stays with me is in the pilot movie, Alexander Mundy(Robert Wagner always looking great,and he still does) decides he's ready to leave prison so dressed as a priest(you must see it to believe it) he walks out only to here that the Goverment wants to offer him a deal,so he breaks back into the prison!  With great stuff like this the show was a blast to watch and always had cool scenes of the ""break in"".

928356,5,6304727127,"Noah was in the first and second seasons, not just the first. He [Malachi Throne] quit after season 2 because he had a dispute with the producers. They filmed season 3 in Italy, or most of it anyway. They didn't want to take him to Italy...they wanted Noah to give Al his assignments over the phone. Malachi said...if I don't go to Italy, I quit...and he did. That pretty much killed the series. The Italy shows ratings dropped, so they came back to the U.S., but without Noah...it was all over.

They did give Al more freedom in season 3. The episode where his Dad, Alister, made the goverment agree to give up their hold on Al if they emptied the vault of a casino. You know, they used the casinos built in vacuum system to suck all of the cash out into the holding bins...too funny. Anyway, with that job...Al was free, but stayed on call when needed as a good American would.

Fred Astaire was in the opening title sequences of only the episodes he was appearing in. Hope this jogs your memory. I just got done watching every episode in order, so it is fresh in my mind. Next to The Fugitive and Gunsmoke...It Takes A Thief is the most entertaining series of all time. Too bad it was short-lived.",1145664000,25,1200,4.376681614349776

928358,4,6304727127,"I always enjoyed Robert Wagner's ""It Takes a Thief"".  My favorite episode was when he played a Texas billionaire socializing with the upper crust while trying to find a microdot containing sensitive gov't info.  The microdot turned out to be in someone's facial mole.  My favorite dialog exchange was this abridged version between Al Mundy (Wagner), Noah Bain (Malachi Throne) and Al's wife/girlfriend (can't remember which) (Susan St. James).  Bain ""Get into this would you"". Mundy pulls out one of his many ""stealing"" tools. Bain ""What's this?""  He examines it and exclaims ""A Geiger Counter!"". Mundy "" Good Noah, you know you have the beginnings of a first class criminal mind"". Bain ""Well thank you...it must be the company I keep"".  Wife/gfriend ""Hey Superthief"".  Mundy ""Superthief"".  wife/gf ""I hope you're not trying to prove anything here because I don't care"".  Mundy ""Would you mind enlightening my parole officer about that...I'm sure he'll be touched"".  W/GF ""Al, what I'm trying to say is...""  Mundy ""Honey, I'll see you when I get back"".

The quality of the video is poor. Universal needed to color correct this series but didn't. The result is quite a bit of the footage looks washed out.
