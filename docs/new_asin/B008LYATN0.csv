8528871,1,B008LYATN0,"The BWO(Supernova & Blue Meanie)-Danny Doring/Amish Roadkill tag team was awful but Nova did alright. The Tommy Rogers-Tracy Smothers match was stupid and a waste of time. The Lance Storm-Jerry Lynn match was just a brunch of spots but still good in it's own right. The Tag Team title match between The Dudley Boys against the team of Balls Mahoney & Masato Tanaka was mindless and pitiful. The Justin Credible/Jack Victory-Tommy Dreamer/Jake Roberts tag team match was a usual pathetic mess of a brawl and this time,it wasn't a good thing. The 6 man team match between The Triple Threat(Shane Douglas,Bam Bam Bigelow & Chris Candido) against the team of of Sabu,Rob Van Dam & Taz was horrible Horrible HORRIBLE!! I give this PPV a 1 out of 10.",1369612800,,744,4.775193798449612

""The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" is pretty much the phrase that summarizes the main event for the 1998 November 2 Remember in that it was a six man tag of the Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Chris Candido, Bam Bam Bigelow) vs. unlikely allies in Taz & Sabu & Rob Van Dam as each member of the team didn't get along with their partners which showed throughout the match as Taz made it clear what his purpose was in the match while one of his partners had other ideas in what resulted as a good match in the ring & brawl outside of it.  Tommy Dreamer was out for revenge on Justin Credible for him not only eliminating Sandman from ECW but also stealing his cane & identity as well so they met in a dream partner tag match that saw Justin choose Jack Victory (who was beaten up badly by New Jack earlier in the night) while Dreamer picked Jake Roberts in a brawl that saw many of Justin's allies appear while New Jack also made his presence known again but the bigger story throughout the night was the appearance of someone from Tommy's past who had a FUNKin' problem with not being picked as Dreamer's partner.  Dudley Boyz defended their newly won Tag Team Championships against Balls Mahoney & Masato Tanaka in a Street Fight Match with Balls & Tanaka coming into the match with head injuries & heavily advised to not take another chairshot to the head in what was the type of brawl you would expect from all these teams.  Other matches include Jerry Lynn vs. Lance Storm with Tammy Lynn Bytch (Dawn Marie) in his corner while the special referees were Mikey Whipwreck & Tammy Lynn Sytch, Tommy Rogers vs. Tracy Smothers, and Blue Meanie & Super Nova vs. Danny Doring & Roadkill.

Overall this was a pretty good PPV but nothing special that stood out over time so it's still worth a viewing.",1369353600,,2076,4.424083769633508
