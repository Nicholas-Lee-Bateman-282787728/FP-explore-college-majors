3723543,5,B001NXDIMK,"""Damages - The Complete Second Season"" stars Glenn Close and features Ted Danson, Rose Byrne, Tate Donovan, and William Hurt.  Academy Award-winner Marcia Gay Harden and Timothy Olyphant join the cast in Season Two.  Following the premier season's legal battle and victory over CEO billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Danson), Patty Hewes (Close) has the legal world at her feet.  Just as she's pondering her next move, Daniel Purcell (Hurt), a man from Patty's mysterious past, re-enters her life, drawing her into a new legal challenge.  What begins as a domestic murder case escalates into the highest reaches of government as Patty unearths a vast conspiracy.  At the same time, Ellen (Byrne), Patty's once ambitious protg, is on a mission to take Patty down.  Ellen has agreed to be an informant for the FBI in their criminal investigation of Patty and the firm.  Patty must unravel the mystery surrounding Purcell and negotiate the dangers both inside and outside her office.
 The raison d'etre of ""Damages"" is Ms. Close, who etches a constantly fascinating portrait of the formidable trial lawyer.  Her Patty is intense, intelligent, shrewd, and volatile -- all business one moment, all girlish and playful the next.  Her unpredictability gives the show an edge and distinguishes it from other TV lawyer dramas.
 The three-disc DVD contains all thirteen episodes of the second season.  Bonus extras include cast and crew commentaries on selected episodes, deleted scenes, a Season One recap, seven character profiles, and a Season Two Post Mortem in which the creators take a look back at Season Two.",1264636800,3,1601,5.162790697674419
3723544,4,B001NXDIMK,"Haven't even finished the first disc, but already ""I Knew You Were a Pig"" is listed as a chapter - anyone familiar with the series (or, say, the text on the outside of the box) will know that that episode is called ""I Knew Your Pig."" Honestly - it feels sloppy to have a mis-titled episode on the first disc. I see it's also mis-titled here on Amazon Video.

Unfortunate, because the show seems so tightly written, well-acted and directed. Good 2nd season; I prefer the first season, but the standard Damages twists really up the ante this season, and though I feel that many of the guest stars weren't used to their full potential, I still love the interplay between Glenn Close and Rose Byrne. Best pair on television, hands down.",1264377600,,732,4.545454545454546
3723545,3,B001NXDIMK,"The first season of ""Damages"" was brilliant.

The second season was very good as well. But, it seems to be missing something.

Upon reflection, I believe the missing ingredient was villians who were just as compelling as the ""heroes.""

In Season 1, the series benefitted greatly from Ted Danson's portrayal of the wayward billionaire Arthur Frobisher. Danson's Frobisher was equal parts ""average joe made good"" and inaccessible, plutocratic jerk; the rare character who you find yourself both repulsed by and rooting for. (This combination made him a yin to Patty Hewes's yang.)

There are no ""villians"" who the viewers can identify with in the 2nd season. The primary antagonist in this installment was an industrialist who would not acknowledge the illegal dumping of hazardous waste because he would ""have his company taken away from him"" if he did. There's nothing nuanced, complicated or vaguely sympathetic about that.

Glenn Close once again turns in an Emmy-worthy performance as a ""Race Horse Haynes"" -esque class-action litigator, Patty Hewes. She's worth the price of the dvd set by herself.

This season kept my attention and was entertaining from beginning to end. But, the first season was virtually perfect and thus, this season which certainly fell short of that, suffers in comparison.",1264377600,26,1302,5.235576923076923
3723546,1,B001NXDIMK,ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TELEVISION. WHERE IS THE BLURAY EDITION? PURCHASED SEASON ONE ON BLU. WANT SEASON 2 ON BLU. UNBELIEVABLE!,1264377600,3,130,4.695652173913044
3723547,5,B001NXDIMK,"There have been two years of Damages, and the third season is about to begin. If you haven't watched the first two seasons, I imagine that it is going to be quite hard to understand many of the references and some of the plotlines and characters of the third. Yet, on a certain level, it doesn't matter. My wife and I have watched the first two seasons - some of the episodes twice - and I doubt that either of us could give a good plot/character summary. Everything is convoluted, nothing is quite what it seems, and no one can be trusted - no one.
  More or less, the story is about a young lawyer (a stunningly good actress - Rose Byrne) who joins a law firm completely dominated by Patty (Glenn Close - absolutely brilliant) and quickly finds her finance murdered and must kill a man who tries to kill her (but the body and all evidence of a killing disappear.) Actually, the series begins with her fleeing from the body of the dead fiance, half naked and covered in blood. There are a great number of various forms of flashback devices throughout the series. It would appear that a billionaire, Arthur Frobisher (played by Ted Danson, who like Ms. Byrne and Ms. Close, delivers a layered performance of great subtlety and depth) is behind the crimes. Patty is trying to destroy him in court because he cheated his employees out of great sums of money. A noble cause to punish him, but Patty will do anything - anything - to win. And everyone who appears to be one thing is actually another. The central oiece of advice given in the program is, ""Trust no one.""
  Thus, the viewer must watch and listen very carefully to keep things straight, yet, as said above, on some level one does not need to understand the story in depth to enjoy the outstanding acting, powerful direction, visual and aural subtleties, and plotlines that force the viewer to make some real effort to keep up with just the basics of what has/hasn't/has/hasn't happened.
  Can a viewer just jump into the 3rd season? I am going to bet s/he can. So far, the on-going program has been so compelling that, like a great meal, it's a shame but it doesn't really matter if you miss the appetizer.
  One final note. Given the show's intensity, it is a real pain to have it interrupted by ads. Either watch it on Tivo so you can fast-forward through the ads or just buy the series from Amazon.
  Very highly recommended.",1261267200,6,2387,4.4919168591224015
3723548,5,B001NXDIMK,"Talk about black mail, back stabbing and all of the other good stuff that goes with a great drama series.  This is it!! The second season is not available yet but I have placed my order and I can hardly wait.",1258243200,4,208,4.073170731707317
3723549,4,B001NXDIMK,"I am not a TV addict. I only watch news (CNN, BBC, DWTV) and football (the real one, not the USaberration). But there are always exceptions... Like now, I am stuck at home with a cold, have to cancel a trip to avoid swine flu quarantine.
What does one do with mountains of windfall time, when one is not fit for serious pursuits? Either one reads pulp fiction, or Hegel (just joking), or one watches TV show DVDs.
This is how I ended up investing hours, that I could have used more productively, with Damages, Season 2. I never watched Season 1, which is supposed to be better, more coherent, more compact. (Watching DVDs when sick has social advantages over reading; one can more easily share the activity.)

My conclusion: if you have to waste your time, this series is not the worst of all options!
What do you get? You get a high society crime soap, focused on a female lawyer, Glenn Close, with unclear morality. You get a beautiful young colleague and co-worker of hers, a Queen Rania look alike, who bears grudges and conspires against her boss. You get the worlds of class action suits, of big capital bosses and their hobbies, of financial manipulations, of environmental crime, of corruption and betrayal... And it is highly complex and complicated and you are forgiven if you sometimes lose track of who did what when and where.

It is good on suspense. It is intriguing on the level of motivation. Some people are easy to understand, they want money and power. Our heroines here, and also some of the men, eg the William Hurt character, are harder to read.
And hardest is the moral evaluation: it is doubly vexing. Not only don't we know the facts, so we can't justly judge, but we are also shown things in differing and conflicting lights, which is of course designed to confuse us. What has actually happened and why? Who are the good guys and who the bad ones? Which moral code counts more in case of a clash?

First class entertainment with brilliant actors. Deduction of one star due to the excessive flipping about with time lines.",1256947200,15,2049,4.592896174863388
3723550,3,B001NXDIMK,"Glen Close and William Hurt do their best in this mess of a second season.  Whenever they are onscreen, they manage to make this overly plotted mess work.  However, let anyone else onstage and I can barely figure out what is going on or care. The young woman attorney who works for Close is a big part of the problem.  Her character is playing all sides against the middle.  I can barely keep track of who she is plotting and conspiring with to undo Close from episode to episode. Hurt is kind of the bad guy here.  I say kind of because his motivations are not all bad.  Rather, he is hiding some huge secrets.  I had no problem following the arc of his story line.  I also had no problem following the arc of Patty's (Close) story line as she tries to win her suit against Hurt's former corporate employer yet also has to deal with her son's rebellion (seeing an older woman and refusing to go to college) and her husband's infidelity. Even Arthur Frobisher's (Ted Danson) reappearance is easy to follow, even funny, as he turns his zeal to other interests.  It is the whole story line between Patty (Close) and the young woman attorney which had me completely perplexed.  It was also very annoying to have this jump back and forth in time constantly.  Seeing this on tv was one thing.  Buying it on DVD?  No way. I really enjoyed season one and did not have any problems with it.  If you haven't seen it, that is the DVD to obtain.",1250121600,18,1434,4.362264150943396
3723551,4,B001NXDIMK,"Season 1 was taut and terrifying magic. Season 2 tries to mix in a major new storyline while still carrying forward the lethal fallout from last season's Arthur Frobisher case. Although teasing and confusing the viewer are part of the stylistic tone of this production, things got a little muddy with too many characters in mid-season.  Still, the Season Finale was so brilliant, it more than paid off its mid-season markers.  Meanhile, the acting of the major characters - Rose Byrne deserves more credit, IMHO - continues to shine.",1248048000,32,533,4.977528089887641

You have to pay attention at all times, because of the relatively frequent changes of the timing of various segments, but because it's so riveting, that was no problem. It all starts with a cryptic opening scene, with only Ellen speaking and the rejoinders missing, because it's to be a surprise to whom she is talking. No one here is innocent or heroic. It seems every character is working toward his/her own ends, and the double-crosses abound. Even Wes, the handsome new love interest, is not untainted. Glenn Close gives another stratospheric performance, and Ellen gets added depth, and cynicism. Who could work with this crew and remain immune to cynicism?

With all the flash backs, the fast forwards, You can't keep up with who done what to whom.  Glenn close finally wears thin
all the facial contortions the up and downs of things being presented in an overly dramatic way.  You finally get the impression
the writers have lost their way and just make up anything to keep the movie going

anyway... say goodnite and stop wasting your time",1402876800,,510,4.571428571428571

3723663,4,B001NXDIMK,"I really enjoyed watching the Damage Series.  I almost stopped watching after the first episode because the characters used the term G_d D_ _ n continuously for no reason!  Saying ""Damn"" or ""Damn it"" would have been stronger more abrupt but to use GD sooooooooooooo much was rediculous!  I am happy to see that as the seasons progressed the use of GD was less, much less by the end.  Their use of GD was an Overdone Political Statement on religion that hurt their writing and viewership!!!  Besides the obsessive use of GD the series was great but the seasons were too short!",1399248000,,575,4.598039215686274

3723678,3,B001NXDIMK,"There was too much switching of the date/time line during a program.  Once, maybe twice per session is OK and easy to follow, but the producers exceeded this way too often.  It really made it hard to follow at times without rewinding and rewatching.  And they just didn't pull it together at the end of the season.  How did Patty Hewes know what was happening?  Guess we will never know!",1397088000,,387,4.4714285714285715

3723697,5,B001NXDIMK,"This is your show if you like your entertainment gripping, intelligent and intense, episode after episode after episode and  season after season. You will need to pay attention.  The writers aren't pandering to a low-brow audience and create clever and knotty plot twists. The characters are well-developed and illuminated by some of the best actors in the business.  Glenn Close renders ""Patty Hewes"" as an amoral, brilliant, and manipulative lawyer, driven by ambition and power.  There are no lines she won't cross to reach her goals or protect her self. She justifies her shadier behavior in the self-righteousness of ""bringing down the bad guys"".  Close absolutely nails this role. Her talents are exceptional.....as is the entire cast. I personally, however, found Rose Byrne to be rather an annoying 2nd lead.  She plays a young associate lawyer whose personal life is completely ruined while her career shoots on to the fast track due to Patty's machinations.  The critics and many viewers disagree with me, but I found her acting skills very limited even though the camera adores her face.  She simply never convinced me that she was brilliant and I just tired of her.  She was certainly proficient enough that she did not detract much from the overall excellence of the series.  I'm surprised this series ended after five seasons.",1394841600,,1340,5.077625570776256

3723699,3,B001NXDIMK,"The story-lines are difficult if you don't give your full attention.  This show uses non-linear story telling.  For a show that had 5 seasons, there were many story-lines that seemed, in-congruent, incomplete, and unfinished.",1394323200,,225,5.588235294117647

We also noted that Netflix and Crackle have this, but in a head to head comparison with Netflix (Crackle has ads interrupting) streaming vs Amazon 80% of the time that Netflix will not even past the initial 10-15 secs test, Amazon comes thru with flying colors. This has also prevented us from starting the new season of House of Cards. Netflix just does not have the speed to handle the volume.

Perhaps today's deal between Netflix & Comcast to provide higher streaming speed will change this, but my money is on Amazon.",1393200000,,760,4.460431654676259

3723719,5,B001NXDIMK,It is intriguing with a strong plot! Foreshadowing and flashbacks are always involved. Actors and actresses are top notch .,1392681600,,123,5.2
3723720,4,B001NXDIMK,"See my review for Season 1.  This one continues the feeling of an undertoad (if any of you remember that word from ""The World According to Garp"".  It drags you down and sucks you out to sea.",1392595200,,190,4.108108108108108
3723721,5,B001NXDIMK,"I hadn't seen this show before, so it was all new to me. I liked the characters and how they interacted, the introduction of new phases of their lives, how they handled the positives and negatives. There was just the right amount of drama and romantic hints and evil circumstances. Glenn Close is so masterful but the new girl Rose was a good match and the dialog was never phoney sounding. I was especially interested in the mother/son conflict and the emotions portrayed by both actors. It certainly was never dull and I anticipated each new episode with eager attention.
Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch the interplay between and among people. Great acting and sets too.",1392422400,,685,4.764705882352941
3723722,5,B001NXDIMK,"This is one of the most interwoven plots to date.  Each episode reveals just so much, but then creates more questions.  I was glad I could watch it one episode after another.  If I would have had to waited a week between episodes it would have been torture.",1392422400,,257,4.3125
3723723,4,B001NXDIMK,"There are no weak links here. Every actor is very good and the story is absorbing and suspenseful. However, it a very dark story in which just about every character has no character. We do not like to go to sleep just after this show and watch something less troubling.",1392163200,,269,4.4
3723724,4,B001NXDIMK,"Not quite as good as the first season, but still pretty awesome. The season was intriguing, interesting, and fast-paced. My only knock is that they conveniently wrapped-up a lot of loose ends in the last 30 minutes.",1391990400,,215,4.837837837837838
3723725,5,B001NXDIMK,"This continues to be a powerful series!
I'm so glad I came watch it all at once.  It would have been hard to wait for weekly installments.",1391990400,,138,4.111111111111111
3723726,2,B001NXDIMK,Would be a great series if the sexual content was left out.  So unnecessary.  I won't watch anything with Ted Danson in it again because of this.,1391990400,,145,4.333333333333333

3723734,5,B001NXDIMK,RIVETING. JUST VIEWED THE ENTIRE SERIES. How could I not known about it. Guess I was working too hard. Loved it and will take the rime to rewatch it again during leisure time to not miss a beat of anything spoken.,1391644800,,213,4.219512195121951

3723738,5,B001NXDIMK,"Great story line, keeps you engaged the entire time. This is almost addictive! Hard to watch just one episode; this is better than popcorn. Just can't get enough of this!",1390867200,,170,4.7
3723739,5,B001NXDIMK,This show never disappointed me and I watch all of it to season 5. The different twist and turns kept me intrigue.  Wish they bring this show back.,1390867200,,147,4.25
3723740,4,B001NXDIMK,"I enjoyed Season 2 overall mostly due to the acting and baseline storyline, however, it became very tedious to me with its constant ""six months earlier"" ""three months later"" ""one week before"" etc.  People whom have seen the show knows what I am talking about.  There was just too much going on with the subplots but again I love the cast and they are all fine actors.  I really enjoyed season 1 better and am starting Season 3 sometime here soon and hope it is a little different regarding the directing technique.  Still with all the distractions I still give it a 4 star and each episode made me want to see the next so I must have like it more than outward feeling were.",1390521600,,673,4.36

3723742,4,B001NXDIMK,The season seemed to drag then ended in a wrap up which I felt was done in a confusing manner. More insight into the sister of Tom Shays may have helped.,1390262400,,153,3.967741935483871
3723743,5,B001NXDIMK,"I was always sorry I missed Damages when it first aired and now I know why.  Season 1 hooked me and now I enjoy watching a couple of episodes at a time since each ends with a surprise. Glenn Close is fabulous....multi-dimensional, to say the least. I wouldn't want to work for her character of Patty Hewes, but I love watching her work! I plan to watch all remaining seasons when I finish this one.",1390176000,,398,4.306666666666667

3723756,5,B001NXDIMK,Season 2 was excellent.  It was filled with incredible suspense and shock .... excellent acting and a well-written story.  It held my interest more than any show I have seen in many years.  Definitely top-notch TV.,1389312000,,214,4.888888888888889
3723757,5,B001NXDIMK,Can this series get any more evil? Wonderful twists and turns by these morally corrupt people and while I only allow myself three episodes at a sitting this addictive show without commercials makes me love amazon prime even more,1389225600,,228,4.871794871794871

3723759,4,B001NXDIMK,"Damages is billed as a drama but proved to be one of the funniest soaps I've seen.  I watched all of season two at one sitting and was guffawing continuously as the treachery level kept rising.  To fully appreciate it, one needs a pad and pencil to keep track of how many ways the characters are screwing each other over.  The acting was more than adequate, although it was hard to imagine poor, emaciated little Rose Byrne going head to head with Glenn Close, whose jaw on its own outweighs Rose by probably 20 pounds.  It was a nice touch that the multibillionaire power-company pirates thought that their scheme called for purchasing a vehicle of Cadillac-SUV status, and at sticker price, for a task that required it only to remain permanently parked on a NY street.  As amusing as Damages has been, I'm questioning whether I can take another season of it.",1389139200,,860,4.631578947368421
3723760,5,B001NXDIMK,"This series keeps you guessing from one show to the other. There are so many twist and turns you need a road map to keep track of where you are going.  The most interesting part of the series is to see the protagonist, Ellen, turn into the very thing that she hates in the antagonist, Patty.  The end of the second season was a real surprise. Just when you thought one thing was happening, something totally different took place.  This is a well written, well acted show and I would recommend it to anyone who truly enjoyed being taken on a exciting ride full of unexpected turns.",1389139200,,580,4.401869158878505
3723761,4,B001NXDIMK,Some things are unbelievable but overall it was entertaining. Don't really like the way the timeline goes back and forth,1389139200,,120,5.05
3723762,5,B001NXDIMK,I like how the story is told & great acting by the whole cast. I wish would have seen it when on TV,1389139200,,99,3.347826086956522
3723763,4,B001NXDIMK,"A legal drama with great suspense, this series is addictive.  The cliff-hanger endings of each episode leads to watching multiple episodes at a time.",1389052800,,149,5.208333333333333
3723764,5,B001NXDIMK,Very complex characters and story line. As a result you are riveted to the screen to make sure you are on top of each ne development,1388966400,,132,4.115384615384615
3723765,4,B001NXDIMK,"I really liked the 1st season, this one is good but not written as good as the first. It is much easier to follow the plot when you watch them one show right after the other.",1388880000,,174,3.861111111111111

3723768,5,B001NXDIMK,Glenn Close is astonishing.  Rose Byrne is great as well.  The story is complex and keeps you enthralled for the entire arc.  Very well written.  This is NOT Murder She Wrote!,1388793600,,175,4.548387096774194
3723769,3,B001NXDIMK,"Not too bad but definitely not as well organized as Season 1. A lot of repetitive flashbacks keep on challenging my patience. Also, it lacks the believable details to support Patty's decision to hire Ellen back against many people's advice. Besides, even thought the show tries to build a reason for Ellen's revenge, it makes her appear to be cynical, hypercritical, and hard-headed somehow.",1388793600,,391,5.125
3723770,5,B001NXDIMK,"...has my evaluation for Season 2.  For Season 1, I had no idea what I was going to be watching.  I was totally hooked from the very beginning.  Excellent acting, plot and direction.  Can't imagine why it was not made into movies as well.  I could not wait to get to the next episode at the end of the previous.  The second night I watched 5 hours straight.  Dramatic suspense.  Very well done!",1388707200,,394,4.301369863013699
3723771,3,B001NXDIMK,"The first season was fantastic, but that was because it was its own full, cohesive story arc. The second season (and the 3rd as well for the record) seem tacked-on like so many movie sequels these days. It is hard to say more without spoilers, so the short version is that the plot, and specifically the choices the characters make, range from far fetched to nonsensical.

The only reason I've still rated this a 3 is that the acting is top notch and the early episodes are pretty good. It is only when they try to tie all of the threads of plot together at the end of the season that the faulty logic is exposed.",1388707200,,613,4.2844827586206895

3723773,4,B001NXDIMK,"I got hooked on this intriguing drama from the very first but had no time to enjoy it before. Although I initially saw bits of the premiere episode, I had to wait to enjoy it until it was available to Amazon.com Prime subscribers to enjoy the full story. I rate the series highly since I believe Glen Close and Rose Byrne played their roles well and the stories were acted engagingly. I trust others will like them too.",1388620800,,419,4.384615384615385

3723780,4,B001NXDIMK,"Glenn Close is excellent as the hard as nails, bitchy attorney, but the technique of flashbacks gets a little tiresome as you know the end of the story somewhat, but not how it got there. It's still good to watch, but not 5 stars.",1388102400,,230,4.25

3723811,4,B001NXDIMK,"Real interesting story line - great actors - interest use of flash backs and flash forwards - Watch it!  For a show about lawyers not a lot time spent in the court room, more about interaction between lawyers and the people they represent.",1384387200,,239,4.558139534883721
3723812,5,B001NXDIMK,"Damages is some kind of series.  Glenn Close is ruthless.  The second season continues the saga of passion, deception and suspense.  I have all the seasons and each season will certainly hold your attention.",1384387200,,207,5.029411764705882
3723813,5,B001NXDIMK,"From the first episode to the season finale, we were totally enthralled. No wonder Glen Close won Emmys for her performances. Rose Byrne, too, continued to emerge as a woman of strength and cunning, as she slowly took on many of Close's character traits--positive and negative. This was a well-written, well-directed season and we constantly watched more than one episode at a time, couldn't wait to see what would transpire next.",1384387200,,430,5.070422535211268

3723816,4,B001NXDIMK,"I stumbled upon this series by accident.  I do not watch much prime time TV, so I did not realize this was such a hit with several seasons already complete.  The drama and suspense are fatastic - though I did not like this season quite as much as the first, it was still addictive.  Watching these episodes is like eating potato chips; it is hard to stop after just one.  I love the format -- jumping back and forth in time.  The season begins with the viewer having a little (though a sensational) piece of the puzzle.  Then, just like a legal case/investigation unfolds, so does the rest of the puzzle.  As the flash backs (and flash forwards) get closer and closer together, the puzzle resolves.  I'm not typically a fan of legal drama, but these are great.  I've recommended this series to friends.",1383696000,,802,4.513888888888889
3723817,5,B001NXDIMK,"The storyline is so well done, it keeps you guessing at every turn. It can get a bit overwhelming at times to keep track of who knows what, and most of all, trying to guess what's going to happen and why (especially with those flashforwards).
In any case, it's hard to not watch the next episode.",1383350400,,296,4.303571428571429

3723820,5,B001NXDIMK,This series was well written and the actors fit their parts perfectly.  I enjoyed the fact that it carried over each week and there wasn't always a different story.  Well done.,1382140800,,176,4.645161290322581
3723821,4,B001NXDIMK,Love this show! I particularly enjoy seeing actors we normally see as good guys being bad for a change. The last season is not as great though.,1382140800,,143,4.333333333333333
3723822,2,B001NXDIMK,More of the same give no satisfaction.  Will not be watching this anymore. Too predictable.  How many more lawyer series can they produce?,1381104000,,138,4.956521739130435

3723828,4,B001NXDIMK,"I had to come back to this season to be able to relate to the final seasons. There are many scenes in the whole series that are forward and backward in time, for me it was confusing when I did not understand which time frame the character's were living. If you have watched ""Twin Peaks""  you may understand my confusion.",1379030400,,320,4.333333333333333
3723829,4,B001NXDIMK,Although one of the main characters had a dark energy (due to what happened in Season 1) the show continues to engage on important topics (this one being in the environment side of things) while also showing more layers of the characters,1378684800,,237,4.666666666666667
3723830,4,B001NXDIMK,And yet I was caught up in the intrigues of all these plotting lawyers and manipulative clients.  Mean and hateful yet evolving characters kept me waiting for the next surprise.,1378512000,,177,4.9

3723832,4,B001NXDIMK,"If you enjoyed Season One you won't be disappointed by Season Two.  What I liked most about this season is how the twists/turns were handled by the writers.  When you think you have someTHING or someONE figured out you soon learn you don't.  My only issue with Season Two and all the misdirection is the sheer volume of it all.  There are a LOT of people involved with lots of agendas and it can start to wear you out.

Props to the writers who took all of these threads and wove them into a fine tapestry of intrigue, mystery and emotion.  Patty Hewes' character is consistent which is needed and Ellen Parsons' character arc build slowly to a wonderful finish.",1377561600,,662,4.475
3723833,5,B001NXDIMK,Loved every minute of this season! It totally had me on the edge the entire time. Tons of twists and turns. Two thumbs way up!,1377129600,,126,4.08

3723835,3,B001NXDIMK,it was okay. I really don't like shows where they show future and then go back and do it several times in one program.,1376352000,,118,3.9583333333333335
3723836,4,B001NXDIMK,"I had heard rumblings about this series, but did not watch it when it was on broadcast television.  However, in search of something smart, well-written and acted, I was delighted to discover Glenn Close as Patty Hewes and Rose Byrne as her ambitious protege Ellen Parsons.  Even though it is a legal drama, time spent in a courtroom is minimal.  The action and intrigue takes place outside the courtroom and wow, it keeps you on your toes!

The series uses flash-forwards, flash-backs, and dream sequences to advance tales of flawed, complicated people.  At the center of it all is a ruthless woman who will do anything to win.  I am already watching Season 3 on my Kindle and am hooked!  If you are not a Glenn Close fan already, this will make you one for sure.  Highly recommended!",1376352000,,784,4.630434782608695

3723840,5,B001NXDIMK,I love the twists and turns of the series. Patty (Close) is almost terrifying in her role as a high poweredNY attorney. She is always thinking five steps ahead of everyone else...except for Ellen (Byrne). Exceptional writing and casting. I'm just in season three and I look forward sitting down with a glass of wine after work to watch the next episode.,1374969600,,353,4.709677419354839

Glenn Close in my opinion gives one of the best perfomances this season than all the seasons (look out for the kitchen scene with her husband)...Everyone keeps says that Season 1 was better however, I want to agree but I just cant because Season 2 was the season that got me hooked. Rose Byrne is sooooo underrated..William Hurt at first I didn't understand his character and what really was his purpose and stance but I get it now.

Patricia Hewes is a strong lawyer who fights to the finish to get what she wants and what her clients deserve. And her protege Ellen is just as strong and cunning.  Watching as Ellen goes through her growth (both personally and professionally) is tough - from her boyfriend being killed, to quitting the firm, to the death of her future partner.

Damages is a great TV show and the acting with Helen Hunt is super! Why a main network didn't go after this show is beyond me all regular TV shows now are junk. Tired of watching reality shows that just show people fighting and yelling at each other with no acting skills and no plot.

3723900,4,B001NXDIMK,"Season 2 is almost as addictive as Season 1 of Damages. However, William Hurt is terrible, godawful. He mumbles & broods, is mannered, and has some weird accent--like he's been imprisoned in Russia for 20 years. Everything he does screams: ""I'm Acting"". He was so great in ""Body Heat"", but there seems to be some BH curse (look at Mickey Rourke & Kathleen Turner). Only Ted Danson escaped that movie to become better. Unfortunately, he is in the background of Season 2. Glenn Close is still ruthless & dominates every scene she's in. Rose Byrne is okay. But when she walks around with her serious ""I'm a bad-ass"" face, it's almost laughable. The most annoying character is Patty Hewes' son. He was a serious misfit in the first season, now, after a few weeks of strict boot-camp, he's the perfect preppie son. Not sure what the point of him is. To humanize Patty? Nothing could humanize that frightening woman. Despite these complaints, it's one of the best cable series out there (w/ Breaking Bad, Deadwood, 6 Ft Under).

I deduct one star because as evil as Patty is, we still should be rooting for her to win. When we discover she hired hitmen to kill an associate out of paranoia, then nothing separates her from the Kendricks, Frobishers, &  corrupt cops she goes after--who do the exact same things. A series where everyone is evil, vain, corrupt & paranoid. And yet the damn thing is thoroughly addictive.",1355097600,,1412,4.712550607287449

It is but in a more subtle way. As far as intensity, it would be difficult to keep up the dramatic tension of the first series without wearing out viewers and morphing into something too melodramatic.

Season Two is more nuanced but just as compelling and addictive.

The season centers around the murder of a scientist's wife. Was she murdered because she knew too much about how a company was polluting its environs? The crimes are as complex as in Season One and many of the same characters return to lend cohesiveness to the story line. Ted Danson charms as Frobisher, Glenn Close is malevolently likeable as Patty Hewes, and you just wish Melissa Gay Harden would wear a bra that fits but it suits her rather blowsy character who sleeps her way to success or defeat.

3723910,3,B001NXDIMK,"""Damages"" is one of the most intelligent and twisty legal thrillers ever to grace television with first-rate performances by Glenn Close and Rose Byrne.  Terrific show, but where is the bluray version?  The first season looked aamazing in hi-def, so I'm not sure why the same treatment was not afforded.  Give us the blu...the show gets five stars...this sloppy presentation is a two star effort...",1317254400,,398,5.092307692307692
3723911,3,B001NXDIMK,"The theme of DAMAGES 2, stated two or three times, is that Patty Hewes, the crusading liberal lawyer, is selfish, narcissistic, and bitchy -- but so is everybody else. Therefore, since she goes after polluters and stock manipulators, she's ""complexly"" good.

That's a good enough theme, and the acting is good, but the bread and butter plotting is dreadful to the point of absurdity. Patty hires murderers to kill people she barely knows who MIGHT betray her. When she does this, it makes her weep -- but she does it anyway. There's your character complexity.

Patty and her firm engage in bribery of judges and advance payment to witnesses, obvious felonies that no one with so much power and money would engage in. As a matter of routine they risk instant jail time, disbarment, newspaper disgrace ... the list is endless. Of course, hiring killers, which they also do fairly routinely, is not exactly wise practice for a millionaire plaintiff's attorney either.

Characters shift their loyalties on a whim and switch them back on another whim. Patty is told repeatedly that she will have to drop her suit against a big corporation -- IF ITS STOCK VALUE GOES UP! What? She has to monitor the corporation's stock price day to day, and pick up her lawsuit and drop it again based on what the stock price does? I don't think so.

As in most legal series, the characters spend much of their time as detectives, spotting facts that others have missed, going to dangerous meetings wearing a wire, etc. Lawyers almost never do that kind of stuff, but in a show where the heroine is saved by one of her tormentors being shot in the head from behind -- you can hardly expect these brilliant attorneys to concern themselves much with legal matters. I think there's not one legal issue in the entire season, except whether certain evidence will be admitted, and to solve that legal problem, Patty bribes a judge.

It's all a kind of madness. The actors act very well, especially considering that they have no roles to play. They are on side A for half an hour, then on side B, then back to side A for the next episode. The hired assassins even break free from the people who hired them. One hired assassin threatens his hirer with assassination if he doesn't drop a lawsuit which then -- perfectly easily goes on without him! By the end of the show hired assassins are killing one another for free, based on things like whom they like to sleep with.

Well over half the incidents in the show are not believable, and none of them shows lawyers being lawyers; the lawyers respond to almost every problem they encounter by planning to commit a crime.

Please! It's fun to be cynical, but only when you're being cynical about real people, not cardboard cutouts getting their brains blown out in basement garages.",1313971200,5,2799,4.676829268292683

3723913,4,B001NXDIMK,"Season One was enthralling: the acting was spot on; the writing was deft; the characters entrancing, albeit malignant; and the plots were Machiavellian and Byzantine. Season Two has much to recommend it; Glenn Close is still brilliant as Patty, and William Hurt introduces a fascinating and dark new character. There is one serious flaw in my view. Who the hell told Timothy Olyphant he can act? His entire range has three expressions: concerned furrowed brow, thoughtful squint, and earnest clinched teeth.

3723918,4,B001NXDIMK,"One word of advice going in to Damages Season 2...  on no accounts watch it without having seen Season 1.  Arguably every bit as good as the first season, we are once again embroiled in the law firm of which Glenn Close plays the matriarch, Patty Hewes.  Well, maybe that's inaccurate to call her a matriarch, after all, this is one of the ballsiest characters on the small screen at the moment.  And, this time around, we get to see more about how this character ticks.  Yes, there is a similarly convoluted plot with reveals and surprises, and once again an interestingly casual use of chronology to tell the story in the way that reveals most about the characters, rather than purely serving the storyline... however, with the addition of an excellent William Hurt, we peek under the hood of Glenn Closes character in a way that was only hinted at in the first season.  It's a brave and effective move, justifying what could have felt like a somewhat redundant second season.  All the characters from season 1 turn up at some point or other.. though Ted Danson's character feels rather awkwardly shoehorned in this time, and his character arc as he attempts spiritual enlightenment feels weakest.  In addition to Danson, we have an always excellent Timothy Olyphant, Marcia Gay Harden and able support from Tate Donovan and even Mario van Peebles amongst others.
While Glenn Close once again anchors the season, making it must see, the series loses its step with Rose Byrne as Ellen Parsons, around whom the plot revolves.  The character calls for a tightrope of vulnerability and toughness, balanced between poised composure and damaged soul... someone able to hold their own with Glenn Close.  Whether it's the writers, or her acting talent, her character fails to consistently hit the mark, and you sometimes wish her scenes could end and move on to the other more engaging characters.  Happily, they normally do.
All in all, if you liked season 1, then you should enjoy this at least as much.  If you didn't see Season 1 - it's not too late to catch up.",1290124800,,2060,4.75561797752809

3723922,3,B001NXDIMK,"What drew me into season 1 was Ellen as the innocent pawn who quickly learned and adapted. I started watching season 2 hoping to see her continue to play in the dirt but try to keep clean. That didn't happen and left me without an interesting character to follow so I'm not planning to watch any more of the series.

I think to be interested in Damages you have want to follow a story of power plays taking place in a legal fantasy land. Do not start watching Damages if you are looking for even a semi-realistic portrayal of the legal system. The legal system is just a setting and everyone is corrupt. Or, in the show's words, ""nobody can be trusted.""

Despite my problems with the story, the acting is top-notch. The combination in my opinion makes for an average TV show. That is to say, Damages is on-par with other legal soap operas available to you to watch.

If you do watch Damages and are having trouble following the story, just quit watching the flash-backs and flash-forwards. They are only there to mislead you.",1282435200,2,1025,4.5

This is the best show around these days and while I was wondering where they could go after Season 1, the whole of Season 2 just rocked my socks off.  ""Ellen is kinda hot"", in the words of Patty's son.  In Season 2, we get to watch her transform from innocent into borderline ""femme fatale"", and there's something that borders on the architypical or legendary in her expression of the persona - beautiful, melancholy, deadly.  I was surprised they could follow up so strong after such a very good first season.  Patty has become more sympathetic and you find you are actually rooting for her much of the time.  She still packs her usual punch though, and when least expected.  Conversely, she takes a few herself.

Rose Byrne and Glenn Close were just fantastic and all the villains were great.  So many different characters.  I love the set locations on this show.  They have a very authentic feeling and they are used without ostentation to great effect.  Interestingly and beautifully shot, seamless fast paced action, tight dialogue and plot are what you get with Damages Season 2.  Just excellent.",1276732800,,1148,4.766497461928934
3723925,5,B001NXDIMK,"Season 2 of ""Damages"" picks up right where Season 1 left off, with fallout from the Frobisher case lingering.  In season 2, a new case is introduced involving an energy corporation and its nefarious CEO, played smashingly well by John Doman.  William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Timothy Olyphant join the cast.

In season 2, the show is still excellent, but the plot is somewhat more convoluted that it was in season 1.  While convolution, in my book, generally adds a welcome layer of depth, mystery and complexity to a show, in this instance it brought some confusion with it, particularly with regard to a character named Dave Pell who's trying to get Patty Hewes' husband Phil Grey to become energy commissioner.  Since I watched the show on DVD, I didn't have much down time between episodes, so confusion was minimized.  If I'd spaced out the viewing, however, I might have gotten lost.  So, when you're watching, pay attention to Dave Pell and how's he's involved.

Although Ted Danson is in season 2, he's not what I would consider to be a main character and he is sorely missed. The seeds of Arthur Frobisher's continued presence in the show are, however, planted in season 2 as he seeks clarity and attempts to build a new business.

However, that is the benefit of picking up the DVDs.

Season Two is much better than Season One, however, one cannot be understood without the other.  The only thing that is difficult is that it seems like the writers tried to squish more of the story into Season Two, and this is evident at the end of the season's episodes, where much takes place during the last few episodes, in what appears to be a larger span of time.

3723939,5,B001NXDIMK,"DAMAGES is brilliant TV.  Just when you think you know what's going on, along comes another twist.  Few series could pull it off as well as DAMAGES.  The casting is flawless as in season 1.  Glenn Close, the ultimate antihero; Rose Byrne almost as malevolent as Patty..Tate Donovan, William Hurt, John Doman, Marcia Gay Harden, Timothy Olyphant, Ted Danson..all are outstanding.  Certainly one of TV's best.",1266192000,,407,5.106060606060606
3723940,4,B001NXDIMK,"The second season of ""Damages"" had quite a lot to live up to. The first season was an incredible tour de force, loaded with twists, solid writing, and outstanding acting. It also introduced its brilliant time-jumping element, which came to a close as the two timelines intersected at the end of the first season in its brilliant conclusion. So what comes next?

Season two of ""Damages"" sees new characters, a new case, and plenty of new twists and turns. It also introduces a new flash-forward timeline, which, while perhaps not quite as compelling as the chaos of season one, still provides many interesting surprises and cliffhangers as the series progresses.

I know that this season was not nearly as well-received as the first, and while I can see the reasons to prefer the first, this still offers an excellent series of television. If anything, it lets us go deeper into the lives of the central characters of the story, with Patty's personal life and past history more clearly explained and examined, and Ellen's own motives are unclear and questionable. Season two is much more of a character study than season one, and at times results in a slower pace. Consider the shift that takes place though, and it is easy to see what this season manages to accomplish: Patty becomes a fleshed out, much more human character over the course of the season, and Ellen starts to come to grips with the dark realities of the world in which she lives. These two women grow together as they try to destroy one another, and the chemistry between them is absolute gold.

The new characters in season two are hit-and-miss: William Hurt as Daniel Purcell offers an excellent performance, though his character was at times understated, whereas the executives of the company UNR (Patty's legal target in season two) are less developed and compelling, and of course cannot hold a candle to Ted Danson's deliciously evil Arthur Frobisher in the first season.

Nevertheless, the season is still a blast, and will keep you guessing until the end. It should under no circumstances be watched without seeing the first season first, but if you've seen and enjoyed the first season, there's no reason not to watch this one. It may lose its balance slightly in the middle, but stick with it--the finale is a satisfying payoff and will leave you craving for season three, which so far has been out of this world good.",1266192000,,2395,4.805825242718447
3723941,5,B001NXDIMK,"This second season of Damages is more of a sequel than a true second season of a television series. I say this because Damages is a very cinematic show. From its cast of big name star, elaborate and inventive plot, dark content, beautiful cinematography and first rate direction; nothing about this show feels like something that came from TV. Season 1 was groundbreaking and thrilling television. Season 2 is a continuation of that, upping the ante for good and for worse. The story is so large and so complex it was, for me really fun to try and put all the pieces together. Most people will complain that it was not as straight forward as Season 1 but I didn't care, the writing was seamless and just made you pay more attention. The acting is stepped up as well, especially from Rose Byrne, the true star of this season. If you are a fan of Season 1 I urge you to check out this sequel season. It really is a continuation of the excellence we found in Season 1.

And how could anyone pass up with a show with this cast: Glenn Close, Rose Byrne, Tate Donovan, Anastasia Griffith, Ted Danson, Michael Nouri, Marcia Gay Harden, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt and John Doman.",1265328000,2,1175,4.516431924882629
