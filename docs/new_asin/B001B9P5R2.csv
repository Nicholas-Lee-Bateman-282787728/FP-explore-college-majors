The first DVD was packed so full that Sammy Franco actually gives you more on this disc to add to the techniques you learned in the first disc. If you haven't done so already, get both discs and learn to protect your friends, your family or even yourself.",1241481600,,383,4.333333333333333
8282393,5,B001B9P5R2,"In this dvd Mr. Franco continues to show the practical and efficient techniques that work in real world situations. The emphasis on street fighting gives the viewer a better idea of will work in a life threatening encounter than what most McDojos teach. This is particularly true in the area of kicking. Mr. Franco demonstrates the practical use of the side kick and more efficient variations of classical martial arts kicks. No snapping, spinning, or flying in this dvd.",1219968000,2,471,4.974683544303797

Most of us are aware or at least can guess a few natural body ""weapons"" (i.ei fists, knees) but Armed shows you all the weapons you have at your disposal that you didn't even know you had! What is great about this DVD is that it shows you how to implement them in a self-defense situation correctly. If you are someone who cares about safety from attack, get this DVD (and part 1 too). It has really helped me.",1214265600,2,548,4.064814814814815
