8056876,5,B00092ZT4Q,"Colors Straight Up offers a glimpse into a world most of us never see. And the way out of a ghetto simply comes down to one word: ""hope"". If the people in a community feel there is no way out, they are destined to lives of failure, crime and drugs. But if they are given hope, it's as if blinders are taken off and they have a reason to work, a reason to reach for achievement. This movie shows one community's response to a group of students who could easily have gone in either direction, and it provides inspiration for projects in our own communities. My hat is off to Morgan Freeman for making it possible for this movie to be made.",1206489600,3,637,4.229508196721311

8056878,5,B00092ZT4Q,"This is the story of an arts program in the Los Angeles Public School system geared torward ""at risk"" youths.  It was filmed in the program's infancy, when Colors United was an extracirricular program at one high school in South Central Los Angeles.

 We are immediately immersed in the world of these kids, without commentary or words of introduction.  The camera simply follows around several students as they shuffle back and forth between their gritty life in the ""hood"" and their alternate ego as a member of an acting and performing troup rehearsing for their big annual show.

The film is heartbreaking many times over, and I, who rarely cry during movies, found my eyes moist througout much of the film.  The movie shows how hard the lives of these kids are, and how courageously they funnel this experience into their artistic performance, which is called ""Watts Side Story.""  For many viewers, it will be a window into a world they have heard of but know very little about. But it is on the moral plane, not the social, that the film really enlightens.

The determination of these high schoolers to commit to each other for the sake of an uplifting common purpose, while all around them their world seems to be coming apart at the seams, is almost the definition of moral courage.

The director is wise not to pontificate or comment on the on screen happenings.  The young men and women depicted feeling their way to adult hood and moral responsibility is the most eloquent statement that can be made.  I can not recommend this film highly enough.  It is especially appropriate for high school age kids or those involved in *at risk* behavior to see ""another way.""",1116115200,27,1674,4.73448275862069
