8416497,2,B004558JRW,"He had a few Good Tips for improving your characters design, BUT SAID NOTHING Upon BUILDING AND DESIGNING YOUR CHARATER. each of his examples were Already Drawn and he simply traced over them in a classroom setting and talked about his ideas to improve them. This was not worth the money and I am not inclined to buy any of his future products.  You can find more in any Character design book at your local book store.",1428883200,,418,4.428571428571429
8416498,3,B004558JRW,"The information is great but the recording itself it lacking, personally i have a bad time with distractions and throughout the videos you hear stuff like phones and other things,I give it a 5 for information but only a 2 for production. This is not a slight on Coleman, as I said the information is great.  But more the person filming it which should have been handled much better.",1359158400,,382,4.536231884057971

8416501,4,B004558JRW,"I ordered this DVD along with David's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Character-Design-Grizzly-Bears/dp/0979068622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Character Design:Grizzly Bears</a>&nbsp;book as a special offer from the artist himself. Both items reached my home in Buenos Aires, Argentina perfectly packed in bubble-wrap plastic inside a light, sturdy cardboard box.

David makes a clear difference between the mere drawing of a character and who the character really is, right from the start. Recorded live with a camera behind his shoulder while creating a character on his drawing desk, he goes through his own musings aloud for letting the viewer know about the character at the same time he develops the design on a paper sheet. Bits of the character's story, habits, past, and customs are mentioned in the talk as the drawing emerges.

Also shown in the DVD are a set of technical skills to take the design from a simple, rather flat shape to a full, volumetric form, along with shadows and highlights that make the final design look very corporeal.

The DVD covers also the issue of developing a personality for a character design. Starting from a single drawing of a character, new drawings are made that shows the character in different situations while preserving the design shown in the first drawing.

The talk behind the designs emerging on the drawing desk (over three hours, separated in chapters) gives useful insight to the viewer. In the case that due to the natural pace at which drawings are made, the demonstration result a bit slow at times, the viewer can still resource to on-screen captions that condense the overall concept behind what is currently shown.

In conclusion, a very nice DVD with lessons and tips to invoke life and personality into characters, very clear and with assorted examples.",1336262400,,1875,5.451724137931034
