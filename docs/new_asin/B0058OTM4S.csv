4601487,5,B0058OTM4S,"Cult movie enthusiasts may be aware of this Russian film as the 'source' material from which 'B"" Movie mogul Roger Corman crafted a couple of his infamous 're-edited' Euroflix: ""Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet"" AKA ""Planet of Prehistoric Women"" - neither of which is held in particularly high regard. Corman obviously recognized the 'potential' of the quality in this elaborately produced foreign space opera and attempted to capitalize upon it by adding English dubbed dialog that eliminated the original nationalistic Soviet sentiments from the plot and (awkwardly) injected some American actors into the mix to (hopefully) give more attraction for the domestic market. A later re-working also added some throw-away pulchritude in a further desperate attempt to entice the public.

With this release of the complete ORIGINAL Russian film - modern viewers may finally have the opportunity to see what got Corman so 'excited', and the passage of time has allowed even the Soviet sub-text to take on an interesting historical relevancy.

It would appear that, flushed with the success of the launch of the first Sputnik satellite, the Russian cinema spared no expense in producing an opulent science fiction production based on the premise of a subsequent manned expedition to the mysterious planet Venus: ""Planet of Storms"" (""Planeta Bur"")

The film opens as 3 separate Russian space craft are approaching the cloud shrouded planet on an exploratory mission. One of the ships is suddenly destroyed by a meteor collision and the 6 remaining crew members of the surviving 2 space craft decide to land on Venus - despite the compromised situation. While the only female of the mission is delegated to remain 'in orbit' all the men (and a nifty robot) descend to the planet's surface in two groups and spend the majority of the movie trying to 'find one another' so they can return to their space ships and thence back to earth.  While it is evident that the Director and production designers were trying to be fairly scientifically accurate in their depictions of space travel - they let their imaginations loose once the cosmonauts set foot on the planet Venus, and provide an alien world populated by a variety of fantastic life forms.  While some of Venus's denizens are portrayed as similar to earthly prehistoric creatures (Brontosaurs & Pterosaurs fer example! ) there are also some very cool other-worldly plant forms and humanoid reptiles in evidence to menace the earthlings as they make their explorations of land and sea in a futuristic space-car vehicle.

Given the time frame of its' original production, the special effects for this film are pretty impressive in scope and execution  and can still be appreciated today for both their period virtuosity, as well as, their dated kitschy aspects. ""Planet of Storms"" is every bit as engrossing as the best Hollywood produced George Pal SciFi space exploration epics and provides more fantastic elements to be enjoyed. I found this to be great fun and a seminal piece of international SciFi well worth checking out.  The DVD is presented in color - Russian language w/ English sub-titles - the picture quality is excellent.  Extras include some interesting 'newsreel' shorts that chronicle the US/Russian 'space race' of the 1960's.  Highly recommended!",1388448000,7,3310,5.1585820895522385
4601488,4,B0058OTM4S,"Original film from which the movies Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet and Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women were cadged.  In its original Russian with English subtitles.  The subtitles read like whoever did the translating knows English as a second language.  The picture is fine and the color is good.  All in all a fine transfer.  The effects are subpar but OK.  The robot looks clunky and moves slower than molasses.  The Venusian wildlife is prehistoric and ridiculous.  The man sized dinos are obviously guys in suits and hop around.  The bronto just stands there.  The flying pterodactyl is for laughs.  The only original monster is a carnivorous plant which is low cost as all get out.  The cosmonauts, while in flight, wear what looks like casual businesswear.  The only intriguing moments are when one of the guys finds a bas-relief sculpture of a humanoid, and as the Earthers are blasting off you see a female humanoid's reflection in a tidewater pool.  Wish they had shown more of that.  Still worth sitting through.  Recommended for sci-fi fans.",1388188800,,1065,4.898876404494382
4601489,4,B0058OTM4S,"The Video Dimension release of Planeta Bur is the best I have seen yet.  I thought Sinister release not too bad, but the Video Dimension version is so much better in almost every way!  The picture quality is very good and the colors so vibrant.  My only complaint is that the subtitles contain quite a few spelling errors.  You do at times, have to think a second about what was meant to be said.  It seems that whoever did the subtitles did not really speak English and the errors were left unchecked.
Otherwise, I would have given this five stars.  The film itself is overall most enjoyable and well deserving of classic sci fi status.  I have always loved this film and Robot John is one of my all time favorite sci fi robots.  His design and function appear quite a bit more practical than other early sci fi robots.  You can really see the Soviet engineering philosophy in John's design (ultra sturdy and practical).  The space suit design is pretty cool too and whoever did the space suit design for Prometheus appears to been inspired by this film.  I highly recommend this release to those who enjoy classic sci fi films.",1365811200,10,1129,4.53960396039604
4601490,5,B0058OTM4S,"I thoroughly enjoyed getting to see this ORIGINAL version. I have wanted to see this in it's original form for a long long time and this DVD did not disappoint.  I wished it had included the documentary about Pavel Klushantsev, the pioneering filmmaker whose innovative filming techniques fascinate.  I am not sure if the original film was in a 1:33 aspect ratio, but that is how it is on this DVD.  English subtitles.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.",1353456000,9,446,4.753246753246753
4601491,4,B0058OTM4S,"This is definitely the best quality version of this Russian classic I've seen, and being a huge fan, I've seen everything from a VHS to a special screening of a restored print at the American Cinematheque.  I'm thrilled to say the folks at Video Dimensions got that restored version.  The image is the cleanest and sharpest I've seen on any home format.  On the menu, you have the choice of English subtitles in either yellow OR white.  Very nice. The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is because the sound level of the movie seems to have been set a bit too low.",1348272000,20,569,4.289719626168225
4601492,5,B0058OTM4S,"A true collectors item for collectors and a must see for aficionados of ""classic sci-fi"".  A solid story line, good effects (for the time it was made), and, some pretty trick devices. It, also, provides some interesting insights to the ""Soviet"" mind set of that time.  This original version makes much more sense and is more entertaining then the two spin-off ""Americanized"" versions.  A very good idea is the choice of two 'color options' for the sub-titles. I found that the yellow option was best..",1433116800,,501,4.870588235294117

4601494,5,B0058OTM4S,"A Must-See for Any Science Fiction Fan.  Had Troubles Getting Subtitles to Work, Working Fine with Fix.

At first, Subtitles did not work for me.  However,  a quick check of my Oppo Blu-ray player owners manual showed how the altitude of the subtitles can be moved up and down. My subtitles were set at the very bottom, and therefore were cut off. Making this simple change allowed me to have the subtitles displaying properly.

The video and audio quality is good, so if you understand Russian you are good to go.

In 1965 Curtis Harrington added several American-made scenes (starring Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue) and released the dubbed result under name Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet. Since all credits were removed, soviet actors were ""renamed"" with non-Russian names (Gennadi Vernov as Robert Chantal, Georgiy Zhzhonov as Kurt Boden) or left completely uncredited.

In 1968 Peter Bogdanovich (under the name Derek Thomas) added several different new scenes involving Mamie Van Doren and several other attractive women in shell brassieres, and released the film as Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.",1428105600,3,1121,5.1602209944751385
4601495,4,B0058OTM4S,"In itself, it's barely worth the effort of nostalgia. Trip to Venus, tentacular thingy grabs one of the guys, token woman nearly blows the missions by being too emotional about it - mostly, it could have been an American effort of the same era. (Except, maybe for an ironic bit just as they're about to leave, and a more ironic bit just after.)

Then there are the extras. The first collects a bunch of newsreels from the era. A few years earlier, Sputnik had turn the cold war Arms Race into the Brains Race. The US and USSR tried to outdo each other with ever-more-dramatic space-capades in the quest for international prestige and alliances - the American views in these newsreels are interesting to try to parse.

I haven't seen the second major extra, and might not. Planet of Storms actually was released in the US not long after it came out. But it had been butchered: cut to pieces lots added in with American actors, and the whole plot corrupted. Maybe, if I put the time into watching that unfortunate effort, I might find some political justification for it. The prospect doesn't tempt me, though.

I have only one gripe, and a minor one: there's no menu of scenes to jump to. You can start at the beginning, or blindly jump scenes, but finding the spot you want isn't easy. Also, misspellings and other maculae leave me wondering how well the English subtitles represent the original Russian. Those are minor, though. Mostly, it's a fair early-60s SF film, a good bit more earnest and less cheesy than many of the era, but still not one to go far out of your way for.

4601496,3,B0058OTM4S,"The video quality is quite good - the best I've seen. The subtitles are not so great. There are many misspellings which could have been resolved with some proof reading. There are several places where there are no subtitles for dialogue. In all, it's a rather good release. But the problems in the subtitles detract from it a bit.",1420243200,,330,4.610169491525424
4601497,4,B0058OTM4S,"First the bad news:

I knocked a star off because the product I received is a DVD-R and *not* a ""pressed"" copy.  This is *not* indicated in the product information and can be a deal-breaker for some.  Video Dimensions needs to be upfront and modify the listing to indicate the media type used.

There are a few mispellings and odd use of English in the subtitles on a few instances but it's nothing major.

Now the good:

It *is* a excellent copy with sharp, clear video and good audio.

Subtitles can be displayed in either yellow or white.

In spite of being a DVD-R I still recommend this disc, especially if you're a fan of the US edit jobs or European SF films.",1397260800,9,666,4.357723577235772

They were just too small and/or light(had to get right up to the set).  There were also some Universal newreel excerpts about the Russian space program and an excerpt from Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.
