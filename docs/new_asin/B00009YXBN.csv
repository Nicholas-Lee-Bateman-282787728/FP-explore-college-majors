1897988,4,B00009YXBN,Bought it for my granddaughter. She watches it over and over. It is also educational.,1264291200,,85,4.733333333333333
1897989,5,B00009YXBN,"My Grandson who is only 2 watches this and looks forward to it every night.  I got it for him for Christmas and my Daughter always had trouble with him when it was time to go home but now that she has that Movie, he is ready to put on his coat and go home.  I guess I rate second to a movie but is definitely worth hearing him sing the songs to the ""Blues Clues"".",1262822400,,363,3.763157894736842
1897990,5,B00009YXBN,My 2 year old grandson loves Blues Clues.  He would watch it for hours if we would let him.  He really likes the alphabet.,1229385600,,122,4.041666666666667
1897991,5,B00009YXBN,"My 21 month old loves Blues Clues, but this particular video was too old for him. I'm sure he'll like it more later.",1187740800,,116,4.086956521739131
1897992,5,B00009YXBN,"My daughter loves this DVD!  At age 2 she can already say her ABCs, recognize all the letters individually, and even write some small words.  This is a wonderful, educational DVD!",1153094400,,179,4.741935483870968
1897993,5,B00009YXBN,I purchased this for my kids and they LOVE it! They sing the songs and even perfected their ABCs... Great item for use both in the car or at home! Highly recommend this item!,1151193600,,174,4.147058823529412
1897994,5,B00009YXBN,"This was our first Blue's Clues video for our three year old and she loves it. It's easy to follow and fun to watch. I even find myself singing the little songs they have in it. It's one of the few videos she has where she actually interacts with the program.

The version we have actually has two episodes and both are a little under 30 minutes.",1092873600,5,346,4.164179104477612
1897995,5,B00009YXBN,"For me, to have those on DVD, with Steve whom my 3 year old loves makes this DVD worth the price of admission.  While Joe is pretty good, Steve has a quality that makes preschoolers feel like he is talking just to them!  The ABC's episode is fantastic for a three and up, as a 2 year old, it went above his head, and what they asked them to understand was too much, but now, on DVD he loved it and was able to participate right along -- they need to recognize first letters of words maybe to truly appreciate it.  The 123s episode is wonderful, teaches counting, addition, subtraction, more, haven't even watched the Joe episodes in 3 viewings.",1067731200,2,644,4.35

7994381,5,B00009YXBN,Blue has been around for some time. When my oldest who is 20 was small he loved blue and now my two year old does. The video is very educational as well as fun for the child. The concepts in the movie help teach small children and make learning fun for them. Great video I would recommend for toddlers.,1492300800,,302,4.135593220338983

7994383,5,B00009YXBN,"Blues Clues came out when my girls were little and became one of their favorites. Now I have a grandson who is two and it has become a favorite again. He does not tune into much when it comes to the t.v. at this age. But as soon as he hears the music he comes a running. I'm not sure what it is but I think it has to do with Steve and interacting with them through the television. It's like he is talking directly to them. At his age I am so amazed at how much he has learned just by watching. These days there is so many shows for young children thanks to Nick jr. But I have to admit there is only a handful of them that have been able to achieve that same level of interaction. We still love Steve from the original shows the best. Joe is OK but he was not quite the same. For what ever reason even my grandson at 2, likes the Steve episodes the best.",1458950400,,854,3.8857142857142857
