8371351,5,B002JBTBIK,Become proficient at evading takedowns and give them back. Clear instruction has advanced takedowns so U should have basic experience in wrestling or Judo before getting into the takedown section but U can jump into the takedown defense from the get go.,1440547200,,253,5.0476190476190474
8371352,3,B002JBTBIK,"The good parts of this DVD are that you are seeing a great MMA fighter demonstrate lots of techniques that work. He gives you some different approaches on common techniques which was good.
The bad part is that the vast majority of techniques that are demonstrated are in shown in opposite stances. I wish he would have shown more same stance techniques because that changes the techniques and most martial artists I know fight in the same stance. The other thing that bothered me was he shows you a technique over and over again in a medium speed loop without stopping it and breaking it down step-by-step. It's explained verbally step by step, but the visual just shows the entire technique over and over again. Not the best way to teach or learn.",1425513600,,748,4.631578947368421
8371353,5,B002JBTBIK,"Techniques on all 3 dvds are great cannot wait until muay thai clinch and muay thai strikes come out, I emailed Victory belt and was informed they are being edited. 1 should be released in 4 weeks and the final dvd several weeks later. I had read a review where someone asked how he moved to the other side of his opponent? If you watch the first DVD Boxing for MMA he explains footwork, and I would not be suprised if in the next two DVD's he covers what most people feel is missing.

Takedown DVD has some great wrestling and judo takedowns, with some takedowns from the clinch. It is a must to have all 5 dvds with the 3 Nogueira dvds to get a glimpse of what makes him a Champion.

The only thing I would want more than anything would be more advise on strategy, though if you listen to him in the presentation of techniques he gives great advise about timing and distance.",1274227200,,877,4.245508982035928
8371354,4,B002JBTBIK,"This is a good solid DVD and and has really good techniques. I won't bother going over the techniques since the other review has a comprehensive list of them.

Pros:

1) A plethora of good techniques that are well executed, and shown from an infinite variety of angles.
2) Good menu system. Very easy to find the one technique you want to rewatch
3) Really breaks down take down defense as a set of 'three levels of defense' (footwork, underhooks, sprawl)

This was the first time I felt satisfied after watching a DVD about takedown defense. I felt Rutten's and Machida's DVDs fell a little flat in this area.

Cons:

1) Feels like a collection of techniques. It lacks the cohesiveness of the Machida DVD
2) The one bonus feature is of A. Silva sparring. That is great and all, but I would have liked to see an interview akin to the Machida DVD. Would have been great to learn more about the man behind the techniques.

All in all I am satisfied with this purchase.",1260748800,3,966,4.4602272727272725

TAKEDOWNS & TAKEDOWN DEFENSE for MMA
a Brian Rule Production
presented by Victory Belt
 Marc Wickert October 18, 2009
[...]
Another blockbuster DVD from ""The Spider"".  Anderson Silva is best known for his impeccable strike game because his fights rarely go any further than his dominating stand-up game.  But on this DVD you'll witness The Spider's devastating takedowns and defense against takedowns that will blow your opponents away.

All tactics on TAKEDOWNS & TAKEDOWN DEFENSE for MMA are in revolutionary technique presentation featuring both orthodox and southpaw optical flow replays, and cover seven main categories:
Takedowns: Set Up With Strikes
Takedowns: Countering Strikes
Takedowns: Over-Under Position
Takedowns: Double Underhook Control
Countering the Shot
Countering the Single Leg: Reversals
Countering the Single Leg: Submissions

Takedowns: Set Up With Strikes
* Setting up takedowns with strikes to the head, and revealing which takedowns correspond with your decoy strikes.
* Double leg takedown after jab/cross combo.
* Kneeblock takedown after cross.
* High single scoop takedown after cross.
* Hand bump to high single - alternate finish.
* Sukui Nage takedown after cross and jab whilst facing off in opposite stance.

* Ouchi Gari inside trip takedown after jab and cross against more experienced competitor.
* Harai Goshi hip throw after cross and uppercut.
* Kata Guruma fireman's carry after jab and cross.

Takedowns: Countering Strikes
* Double leg: turning the corner by ducking under opponent's strikes to apply a double-leg takedown.
* Double leg: duck under to hip-lock, circling opponent after avoiding his strikes before taking him from rear and employing extra lifting power in your takedown.
* Double leg: ankle block by avoiding opponent's hands whilst performing low-to-ground takedown.
* Body lock to mount by dropping level before applying body lock, then takedown - excellent for setting up mount.
* Inside leg trip to Uchi Mata by blocking overhand punch before applying body lock and elevated sweep.
* Mid-kick catch to inside leg trip by catching his kick, then sweeping his other leg.

Takedowns: Over-Under Position
* Pummeling to clinch drill: working from overhook/underhook neutral position to gain double underhooks.
* Drop Seoi Nage shoulder throw by dropping elevation and flinging opponent onto his back.
* Hiza Guruma: foot sweeping opponent from clinch.
* Double leg scoop slam, wrapping up his hamstrings, hoisting him up, and driving his body into the ground.
* Lateral drop: from clinch, drop your hips, drive upward with under hook, and drag opponent backwards onto his back to set up side control.

Takedowns: Double Underhook Control
* Pummel to double underhooks is a handy drill to practice securing double underhooks.
* Inside trip whilst maneuvering opponent before sweeping his lead leg from clinch.
* Knee bump causing your opponent to fall over your lead leg without actually sweeping him.

Countering the Shot
* Circling away: standing, using deflection and evasion to counter his shoot when in opposite stances.
* Reverse collar-tie to knee, which is the same as the previous technique, but with added collar-tie dominance of opponent before delivering a knee strike.
* Collar tie to knee: another variation of previous two techniques, but while facing opponent in same stance.
* Muay Thai clinch to knee: Anderson demonstrates one of his signature moves, incorporating the Thai clinch and knee strike whilst avoiding his opponent's takedown.
* Circling away: sprawling, where your opponent shoots in and you sprawl to his side while taking his back.
* The sprawl: a drill practicing shadow boxing prior to sprawling.
* Sprawl to head control where you sprawl and secure his head for a submission, ground attack, or to stand back up.

Countering the Single Leg: Reversals
* Switch - warding off his single-leg takedown attempt by seizing his leg and hurling him to the floor.
* Spladle throw - variation of previous technique.
* Khabarelli throw - another variation of previous two techniques, with all having useful applications.
* Back sweep off high crotch, where you take your opponent to the mats whilst setting up a dominant position.
* Ankle-pick reversal, countering his single-leg takedown with a low-to-ground sweep.
* Two-on-one arm trap, isolating one of his arms during his attempted takedown and throwing his body to the ground.
* Switch-step to inside trip, sweeping his lead leg and taking him down before claiming advantageous position.

Countering the Single Leg: Submissions
* Standing guillotine, choking out opponent while countering his takedown.
* Front headlock (aka executioner choke), basically a front naked choke.
* Kimura: fitting opponent with arm lock and forcing him down whilst standing over him.
* Reverse triangle (advanced technique), taking him down with you from his shoot while catching him in a triangle.
* Scissors takedown to kneebar, using the leg sweep before submitting him with a kneebar.
