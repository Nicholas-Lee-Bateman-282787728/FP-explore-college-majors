738924,3,6303922368,"One of the inherent problems I have found with Hollywood biographies is a desire on the part of the studios to tell less of the truth and more of what they feel is great storyline. To be honest, unless an audience was there at the time of the actual events, how would they know the difference? While I am not necessarily in favor of playing fast and loose with the facts, I would like to recommend ""The Eddie Cantor Story"". Keefe Brasselle's energetic portrayl of Ol' Banjo Eyes was certainly more than enough to keep me interested and sparked in me a desire to start collecting recordings of this marvelous performer. I do not doubt that the facts may have been triffled with, but who cares? Just get this movie and enjoy a slice of real musical talent. The songs are top notch and the sound quality well recorded.",969408000,3,815,4.476510067114094
738925,5,6303922368,"I found The Eddie Cantor Story to be as enjoyable as The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again.  I am a big fan of both singers.  I have record albums of Eddie Cantor narrated by Eddie Cantor and another narrated by George  Jessell, and both record albums are accurate with the movie.  The acting  and music are both first rate.  Trust me on this movie.  If you buy it, I'm  sure you will enjoy it.  If you like Eddie Cantor you will enjoy this  movie.",946684800,16,450,4.188235294117647

739037,3,6303922368,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a while. The last time I saw it was in the Metropolitan Theater in Boston in 1953.
Good quality - hokey, but predictable acting, great memories, but a little too steep in price for a bare-bones disc.",1352419200,,249,4.208333333333333
739038,3,6303922368,"""The Eddie Cantor Story"", I think I can state with equivocation, is not one the greatest musicals to come from a Hollywood studio during the 'Golden Age' of film musicals and its star, Keefe Brasselle,does not appear to be always comfortable in the role of the banjo-eyed entertainer.  However, with Cantor having pre-recorded all the songs, Brasselle's lip-sync to the lyrics is adequately convincing.  I never saw the film when it first went on circuit in 1953, so the Warner Bros Archive Collection release has given me the chance to view what I missed all those years ago.  To most of the modern generation neither Eddie Cantor nor his songs will mean very much - if anything at all - but to a person of my age, the tunes bring back memories of times past and it would do no harm if today's youngsters spent a little time in watching ""The Eddie Cantor Story"" as it reveals a 'Golden Age' in the annals of Tin Pan Alley, with the 'hits' of many of America's greatest popular tunesmiths of the 20th century.  A poignant moment in the movie is when Eddie and his wife Ida arrive at the sdtudio to see a 'preview' of the picture and just before the end credits we see him make a short comment on what he has viewed - quite evocative in as much as Eddie Cantor has been dead for the best part of a generation.  In summing up then, it is enjoyable entertainment and it is worth the three-star rating I have given it.",1285113600,3,1414,4.402298850574713
739039,3,6303922368,"I've not seen the DVD, but I'm quite familiar with the movie. Yes, this is a flawed film, starting with the the lead actor, who only really hints at an impersonation of Cantor. (The Durante imitation with the puddy nose is even worse, but mercifully brief.) And, yes, oh my, the blackface routines. You can't escape them as they were much a part of Cantor as late as his cameo in ""The Will Rogers Story."" (Rogers Jr. trades cameos in biopics, obviously.) They are unforgivable, but you have to study it as part of history, and Cantor (who really did do much to fight racism against Jews and African-Americans)seemed to do this schtick at the drop of a hat. Perhaps it is just as well to say, even nice people can be wrong, and were, and this is proof. Now, having said that, some basic fabrics of the story are true: his grandmother's death, his stock market losses, his heart problems and his incredible involvment in charity, including the March of Dimes (which hardly gets mentioned). Perhaps the best part, and what is worth watching, are the recreated musical sequences. Even older, Cantor's recording of his hits shows the charm which sold millions of his novelty songs and made him a major star on stage and radio and eventually TV. In the end, Cantor, for any faults, still deserves a better screen bio-pic, but it is still worth it to hear one of the most successful, most recognized and most imitated of stars in the first half of the 20th Century do his thing and glean a little about the remarkable life he DID lead. When he sang, ""I'd love to spend each Sunday with you,"" millions agreed and tuned him in. He's almost forgotten now, and this movie isn't the best showcase, but it is a showcase.",1281830400,3,1707,4.545454545454546
739040,5,6303922368,"I personally dislike Brassell, but I loved him performing the songs.  I have always preferred Jolson to Cantor as a singer, entertainer and as he comes across just as a person.  Nonetheless I disliked ""The Jolson Story"", maybe because I wasn't interested in his youth.  I would own and love ""Jolson Sings Again"" however, except I read that Jolson himself did not dub the songs for that flick.  I thought the Cantor flick was exciting and fun - except when Brassell was required to act instead of ""sing"".",1281484800,2,503,4.681818181818182
739041,3,6303922368,"This is a woefully insubstantial and inaccurate biopic of one of the towering giants of the American show business.  Filmed in 1953, it seems to be an effort to track the story line of the Jolson Story, with Canor as the subject.  Keefe Brasselle's lacklustre performance conveys nothing of Cantor's incredible impact on American society, nor the intensity of his intellectual reach.  That said, Cantor did record the vocals for the picture in late 1952, shortly after his first heart attack.  Infirmity aside, the recordings are first-rate up-tempo versions of many of the Cantor classics, including a handful that were not on the Capitol soundtrack release concurrent with the picture.  The songs are worth the price of the picture and, giving the devil his due, Brasselle does a pretty good imitation of Cantor's hyperkinetic, prancing singing style.",1268956800,2,853,5.197080291970803
739042,4,6303922368,"Eddie Cantor was a popular entertainer from the beginning of the 20th century. He grew up in the slums of New York, finding himself in trouble with the local gangs, though at heart he was always a good boy (Richard Monda). Fearful that her son might grow up the wrong way, his grandmother (Aline MacMahon) lets him go on the stage with Gus Edwards (Hal March). He (Keefe Brasselle) grows up to be quite the attention hog, but always a good hearted man. Slowly, his fame rises, but with each new set of hands to applaude, Cantor becomes even more restless in the pursuit of fame, even at the expense of his wife (Marilyn Erskine), children, and health.

There are many other famous names peppered throughout the film including Florenz Ziegfeld, Will Rogers and Jimmy Durante.

There are also several problems with the film. Brasselle's performance is sometimes a bit too exaggerated, making Old Banjo Eyes seem a bit too feminine and silly. The selected music is very good, but like that recorded for The Jolson Story which inspired this film, it was recorded when Cantor was much older. It actually suffers a bit in this instance; it is less upbeat and energized. Finally, the film completely ignores Cantor's career in films, a major part of his life and the reason his legacy has been preserved.

Cantor makes a small appearance at the end of the film, obviously an aged man, but still with those expressive eyes. It serves as a bit of a bow to his public.",1174262400,2,1458,4.6434108527131785
739043,1,6303922368,"If you want to see what the real Eddie Cantor was like in his prime, watch Palmy Days or Roman Scandals, both made in the early 1930s.  Even though the vocals in this biopic were recorded by Eddie, he was older and in poor health and did not sing as well as when he was younger.  Sadly, the movie does not tell about Cantor's humanitarian nature:  his verbal attack on the character of anti-semitic Father Coughlin in 1939 that put an end to Cantor's half-million dollar radio contract; his having Sammy Davis Jr. as a return guest on the Colgate Comedy hour in the early 1950s after Sammy's first visit caused an outpouring of hate mail; his coining the phrase ""March of Dimes"" when FDR asked Cantor for advice in raising money to fight polio.",1173225600,6,744,4.496296296296296
739044,4,6303922368,"I just recently purchased this movie--I remember looking at on tv, when I was a kid, and I did enjoy it then, and I enjoyed it even better now, since I was now looking at it in color!!

The only flaw I saw in the movie was that Mr Brasselle did overplay Mr Cantor's mannerisms just a little, but the blame should not have been on the actor alone, but also the director, who supervised the whole movie while it was still in production--and where was Mr. Cantor when this movie was being made??  It seemed he should have been around for just a couple of scenes, and made his comments known before the movie was finished--Instead after he reviewed the whole picture, his comment was, ""If that was me, I didn't live"".

The actor must have been devastated, along with the comments of the critics--This man's career was never the same again!!

It seems a shame to blame only the actor for the quality of the movie, and not the others who were involved in the making of this biopic--As I stated earlier, I enjoyed the movie, and I will see it again and again!!Thanks to Mr Brasselle's energetic (if somewhat overplayed) performance of Banjo eyes!!",1147046400,8,1140,4.492753623188406
739045,3,6303922368,"After having read several negative reviews for ""The Eddie Cantor Story"" I was hesitant to purchase this video but I felt, ""what the heck"" and did. I am glad I did as I enjoyed this biography, due in no small part to Keefe Brasselle's energetic portrayal of ""The Apostle of Pep"". One of the inherent problems I have found with Hollywood biographies is the desire on the part of the studios to sacrifice facts for what they believe to be great storyline. While this may have been true in this case I nonetheless enjoyed watching Mr. Brasselle entertain me with his spirited recreation of Mr. Cantor's routines. For those of us too young to have had the pleasure of seeing Eddie Cantor perform on stage this will be the best chance of doing so.",969494400,14,741,4.537313432835821

7856778,5,6303922368,"I just love this movie. the story of one of the greatest entertainers of the American showbusiness industry. Eddie Cantor was the biggest singer in America in the '30's and '40's and beyond , but , today is totally unknown. He was bigger than Al Jolson, Bing Crosby  and Frank Sanatra.

7856780,4,6303922368,"This is an entertaining biography of one of the most unique American entertainers of the 20th Century -- ""Old Banjo Eyes,"" Eddie Cantor. It follows him as a boy of 12 on the Lower East Side of New York, through an orphanage where he sang and danced on the institution's stage (and met another orphan named Georgie Jessel); into the start of his theater career performing for the famed Florenz Ziegfeld in his ""Follies""; his marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Ida; and the birth of their five daughters as the frenetic, always-on Cantor climbed the ladder to entertainment success.

Keefe Brassell does a good job portraying Cantor, pop-eyes and all. I wonder if he had to have corrective surgery on his own eyes after the filming? He seems to exaggerate Cantor's bug-eyed look for the camera. But Brassell looks and sounds strikingly like Cantor as he sings and dances -- one might say, ""prances"" -- around stages, and later, movies -- in his inimitable style, which was not quite like any other entertainer's.

The movie also deals with the heart attack Cantor suffered at a relatively young age, apparently from being always ""on the go"" pursuing a higher rung on the theater ladder; how it left him depressed and not wanting to go on with his career; and how he snapped out of that after meeting a group of orphans who were attending the same summer camp where he had gone when their age.

The thing that popped out at me -- I mean, besides Brassell's eyes -- was the fact that in several live theater scenes, he appears in blackface. Of course, this was historically accurate, as Cantor and a number of other White entertainers still ""blacked up"" in those days. And in 1953, the year this movie was released, no one, or very few, thought anything about a White got up like a black for entertainment purposes. I had to laugh when I thought what a screaming, stomping, spit-slinging hissie fit the politically correct crowd would have were such scenes to appear in a film made today!

All in all, not terribly deep, but an entertaining show. Just like Eddie Cantor.",1410307200,,2069,4.691460055096419
7856781,5,6303922368,"I saw this (more than once) several years ago.  Like the other impartial and acidic negative reviews, I didn't like the actor who played Cantor either.  But his impersonations of Cantor singing and performing are out of this world and the reason I bought another copy.  Also a chance to hear a lot of Cantor's songs in one flick, instead of one or two per Cantor movie.  I just watched ""Kid Millions"" (it came yesterday) - Cantor did NO performing (for me most of the charm of his singing) - and Merman and Southern sang more than he did.  (A great chance to see young Ann Southern (Harriet Lake on Bway) and very early Merman - I wouldn't have missed it.)  When he was between the two kids who danced, each taking a turn, each pushing Cantor aside every time his turn came - over and over until Cantor left the stage to them - it was a cute and effective joke - until it the piece ended and Cantor hadn't danced at all!  And a few days before that I watched ""Show Business"" (a much later film, though Cantor was not too old to do it) - there was much more Cantor in that one though he shared the spotlight with a surprisingly good Senator Murphy.  I cried at the end  - 40s films always make me cry - although the ending was happy.

In the Cantor Story (the film here) two numbers are strong and clear in my mind.  Cantor as a kid trying to impress his girlfriend by pretending to be a singing waiter (the song was ""Row, Row, Row""), and later on Bway doing an A-Plus impression of Cantor singing ""Josephina Please No Leana On The Bell"" - Cantor couldn't have done it better himself, and I want to see it again.

As for Cantor's voice being to old to sing the songs well, that is just not true.

Keefe Brassell was no Bogart, but he was a first rate Cantor.

The flick (DVD) came yesterday, and I watched it.  My opinions remain unchanged.  I cried all thru it.  I did think Brassell was much too tall and heavy for the part.  And I thought he made Cantor look silly when he wasn't singing - I hate to say that, but I did. And no mention at all is made of Cantor's movies.  I really like to watch Cantor perform and dance when he sings, so just a soundtrack wouldn't do it,",1407801600,2,2173,4.180288461538462

When I saw this video was available, I grabbed it. But there is something missing. A song in the original
and on the LP ... 'When I'm the President' is one thing missing. It looks like it was cut from just before the boys camp scene, where the boys chanted ... 'we want Cantor'. I will need time to suss out if anything else is missing as well. Very disappointing.",1370131200,2,483,4.148936170212766
