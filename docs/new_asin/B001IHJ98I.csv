8310992,2,B001IHJ98I,"We were hoping for something more interesting.  We don't see much of Don Cherry in the U.S., since he is on TV in Canada but we thought he was supposed to be interesting and controversial.  Coach's Corner is basically a fashion show (not much hockey discussed).  The hockey action highlights are fine - a compilation of what you see on TV throughout the year.  But there is no accompanying audio commentary (not even the original game announcers).  There is only a single, repetitive soundtrack.  It gets monotonous.",1268524800,,516,4.873563218390805
8310993,5,B001IHJ98I,"DON CHERRY IS A GUY WHO YOU EITHER LOVE HIM, OR HATE HIM.  FROM HIS EXPRESSIVE SUITS (HE'S PROBABLY THE ONLY GUY THAT CAN WEAR THAT STUFF) WHICH I LOVE, TO HIS OPINIONS THAT HE SHARES.  THIS VIDEO IS A GREAT CATCH ALL FOR SOME GREAT FISTICUFFS.",1262131200,,244,4.170212765957447
8310994,5,B001IHJ98I,"The product was exactly as advertised and I am pleased with it.  Unfortunately, if you are in a hurry for something from this seller, be sure you pay for some sort of express mail.  I ordered 4 items from different sellers on the same day with regular delivery; this product arrived 10 days to 2 weeks after the other products.",1259193600,,327,4.433333333333334
