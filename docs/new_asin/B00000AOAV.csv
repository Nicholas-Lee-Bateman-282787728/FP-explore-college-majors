1199110,4,B00000AOAV,"""First a collision, then a dead navigator, and now a monster's roaming about my ship.  Well, it's totally inexplicable.""  So says Rigg, captain of the passenger liner Empress, to the Doctor.
What happened?  A freak accident takes place within orbit of planet Azure.  The Empress nearly collides with a small ship, the Hecate, while in lightspeed and materializes around the smaller ship so that they have fused together.  The nose of the Hecate is sticking into the Empress, blocking the larger ship's access to the power room and passenger deck.  The blurred overlap areas, or matter interfaces between the ships, however, are unstable.
Into this situation comes the Doctor, Romana, and K9.  The Doctor offers to help separate the ships, something to which both Rigg and Dymond, pilot of the Hecate on a survey contract job, are amenable to.  All that has to be done is to recreate the circumstances of the accident:  ""excite the molecules, full thrust, then full reverse.""  However, Rigg's navigator Secker, who got them into this accident, is on vraxoin, a highly addictive drug that ""induces a warm complacency and total apathy until it wears off that is, and soon you're dead.""  In fact the Doctor's seen entire planets destroyed by this drug.  Secker's then attacked and killed by something clawed.  The questions are, who provided Secker with the vraxoin, and what killed Secker?  After all, vraxoin can be detected by the Empress's scanning device, and the Empress's route is the milk run from Station 9 to Azure, nowhere else, with no stops inbetween.  And who is the mystery man who knocks out the Doctor, then tries to evade him later?
There's also Tryst, a zoologist with a funny accent and really thin trendy rectangular glasses, on a research expedition to preserve rare species on government funding, made difficult by the Galactic recession.  With the aid of the CET (Continuous Event Transmuter) machine, he records the flora and fauna of planets on an event crystal that continue to exist in the machine.  A simpler way of naming the CET is an electric zoo.  However, the lack of a dimensional osmosis damper in the CET means that with the freak accident, the unstable overlap zones affects the dimensional matrix of the machine, meaning things can go in and out of the machine.
Things heat up when two trigger-happy and bureaucratic Azure excise men, Fisk and Costa, try to arrest the Doctor and Romana as the vraxoin smugglers, and someone slips some vraxoin in Rigg's drink.
The cliffhanger to Episode 1 is effective, as a shaggy monster with glowing green appears from a wall panel K-9 has lasered away.  And some interesting special effects are used when the Doctor enters the unstable matter interfaces.  However, two goofs are apparent.  When Della, Tryst's colleague, is shot in the head, she clutches her stomach.  Also, Fisk calls Tryst ""Fisk"" in Episode 4.
Two funny lines from Tom Baker.  When the Doctor's cover as an insurance agent is blown, he says, ""I wonder why I hadn't been paid.""  ""That's not good enough,"" says Rigg.  ""That's what I said."" responds the Doctor.  Also, he playfully says that Tryst helps conserve species in the same way a jam-maker conserves raspberries.
If one adds a shaggy beard to David Daker (Rigg), one will recognize him as the warlord Irongron from the Who story The Time Warrior.  His transformation from an upright responsible captain to a complacent, laughing, apathetic man addicted to vraxoin is good.  When someone points out to passengers being killed, the vraxoin-addicted captain says ""They're only economy class, what's the fuss?""
The issue of drug addiction is key here, but are the dealers justified in saying of the buyers, ""they had a choice""?  If it's something dangerously addictive that totally incapacitates a person, as in vraxoin, well, no, but what about something less or not addictive, like marijuana?
Apart from the flaws in Episode 4, Nightmare Of Eden is watcheable, with laudable special effects, but nothing too special.",1074816000,3,4012,4.981981981981982
1199111,3,B00000AOAV,"There are two Tom Baker eras - one is very dark, sophisticated and Gothic, the other is mostly rather tacky, childish and spoof-like.  Unfortunately 'Nightmare of Eden' falls into the latter category.  The idea behind it is sound enough, with interesting concepts such as two spaceships emerging from light-speed at the same point in space, as well as the grown-up theme of drug-smuggling.  The problem lies in the story's execution.  For a start, the central villain is just too comical to take seriously.  Then there are the cartoon-like scenes in which the Doctor leads the Mandrels away, and later emerges from a mauling with his clothes in tatters but not a scratch on him.  In fact the whole thing feels too much like a live cartoon.  If you want a Dr Who story from the campier Tom Baker seasons you'd be better off with the far superior 'Sun Makers' or 'City of Death'.",1021334400,2,877,4.69281045751634

1199113,2,B00000AOAV,"Writer Bob Baker (Co-creator of K9) goes solo in this story set aboard a space cruise liner.  Sadly, the story isn't as strong as it should be, and Tom Baker appears to know it.  One of the final scenes when the Doctor  discovers, without any explanation to us, that his dog whistle can lure the  monsters like the Pied Piper, he manages this terrible level of silliness  as they home in on him and he yells off screen, ""My legs!  My arms!  My everything!""  The story only set the tone for the rest of the  season;  childish stories.",945993600,2,533,4.346938775510204
1199114,2,B00000AOAV,"Dr Who can still be good without being scary, so resorting to a childish, cartoon-like atmosphere is not needed at all.
There are attempts to do something serious in this story - drug-smugglers, an endangered species,  what can happen when two spacecraft appear out of light-speed at the same  point in space - but its all completely undermined.  Not only are there two  military types (actors obviously having a good time), who strut about like  pantomime villains, but also a scientist with an accent so unconvincing and  laughable you wonder if he's actively trying to eliminate the audience.  K9  continues to prove what a curse on the series he was - instead of the  Doctor finding clever ways out of situations, all we get is a laser-gun  battle.  And the sight of the Doctor, a supposedly non-violent character,  sending in his robotic assistant to kill people and endangered animals  alike is hardly inspiring.
If you want to see one of the stories from the  later part of the Tom Baker era then you're better off with 'City of Death'  or 'Destiny of the Daleks'.",943833600,5,1071,4.744565217391305

1199125,2,B00000AOAV,"The 17th season of Doctor Who is often regarded as one of Tom Baker's weaker seasons, with almost every story, save City of Death, being bad to mediocre. And Nightmare of Eden certainly follows this example. In this story, the Doctor and Romana arrive on the space liner Empress, which has fused with another spacecraft in a hyperspace collision, and the Doctor has to find a way to separate the ships. Sounds like this premise could carry a whole story, right? Well apparently not, as the writer, Bob Baker, adds subplot after subplot, which completely dilutes the focus of the narrative. In addition to this plot, the Doctor also discovers that someone on board the Empress is smuggling drugs. What connects the collision, the drug-smuggler, and a planet called Eden, home of the terrifying Mandrels?

Okay, first of all, the acting can be simply dire, with the actor playing Tryst being absolutely awful. However, Tom Baker and Lalla Ward both give fantastic performances. The script is all over the place, and is in such a rush to tie every subplot together that it actually hampers the story. The pacing is clunky, and the story doesn't become interesting until episode 3. Also, the production is simply hilarious. The Mandrels are some of the worst monsters to appear in the show, and the sets are awful. I know it sounds like there is nothing to recommend here, but there are actually some fantastic standalone moment. But for every great moment, or funny Tom Baker line, there is a terrible set or a pointless and convoluted plot point. I only recommend the story if you are a fan of the classic series. If you're looking to get in to Tom Baker, I wouldn't start here.",1397433600,,1676,4.739726027397261
1199126,3,B00000AOAV,"This story is intersting as it deals with a drug that wiped out many people on many worlds in the past.  It seems now someone is trying to smuggle it on a space ship.  How they do it turns out to be rather interesting as well...

Things are let down quite a bit by the silly monsters.  I've always found Lalla Ward to be too pompus, but Tom Baker does well as always.  Most of the supporting cast does a good job, too.

The extra content is very honest... the production staff tells it like it was:  the whole experience was pain.

Watching the final product isn't pain, but it is neither a good or bad story.",1375660800,,609,4.145299145299146

1199133,3,B00000AOAV,"While I find a lot of Season 17 stories that get branded as the worst of the worst (Horns of Nimon, Creatures from the Pit, etc.) for being ""too silly"" as it were, I find that taken in the spirit of a good, fun adventure to watch, Season 17 offers a lot of the best around.

Sadly, this is the only time where I think the criticism is a little justified. It's supposed to be a more serious story, with a strong drug-running theme, yet it definitely feels like a lot of the cast are putting on a different show to their lines. With the exception of Tom Baker, a lot of those, most notably the bloke playing Tryst, but also the guy who played the lead security guard for example, should've been more along playing the role straight.

All in all, not totally bad, i find it enjoyable, but it's definitely jarring. If you're unsure about whether to buyt it, the extras are VERY informative as to why the negative aspect happened, especially about the blow-ups behind the cameras.",1348790400,,975,4.411111111111111
1199134,2,B00000AOAV,"""Nightmare of Eden"" is frequently singled out as perhaps the worst story of Doctor Who's 17th season (although I would argue ""The Horns of Nimon"" is a close rival). The production required the firing of director Alan Bromley before taping was complete, and it is remembered with dread by virtually everyone connected to it. Despite its many flaws, however (and there are many, many problems with this story), ""Nightmare"" was only a mediocre production, not a genuinely bad one.

The Doctor, Romana and K9 land aboard a luxury spaceliner right after it emerges from hyperspace and becomes interlocked with a smaller cargo ship traveling in restricted space above the planet Azure. In addition to passengers returning from holiday, the spaceliner is carrying a scientist named Tryst whose ""Continuous Event Transmuter"" records life on other planets onto crystals. The Doctor soon discovers that someone on the spaceliner is smuggling the deadly addictive drug  ""vraxoin"" and that Mandrels, ferocious furry animals from the planet Eden, are escaping out of Tryst's machine and roaming the ship.

A brief 13-minute making-of documentary highlights many of the problems ""Nightmare"" faced in production. First, model scenes depicting the collision of the two ships in space were taped on video at BBC Television Centre to cut costs rather than shot on film as originally planned. The crew had to wrestle giant video cameras around the studio to make the ship models appear to move, and the use of colour separation overlay caused patches of the elaborately designed spaceliner to dissolve here and there against the background of space and the planet Azure. On top of that, the spaceliner's ""luxury"" passengers wear ludicrous silver overalls and read magazines in their seats as the Doctor walks the length of the same passenger compartment repeatedly to create the illusion the ship has hundreds of passengers.

Another problem was that interior shooting of the spaceliner in the studio was so brightly lit that the furry Mandrels appear as great galumphing teddy bears instead of interplanetary killers. The producers of Doctor Who had long since been ordered to tone down the violence of the show, so ""Nightmare of Eden"" tended to hark back to the show's origins as a children's Saturday teatime program rather than a gripping SF-horror series that might appeal to a broader range of viewers.

At bottom, however, ""Nightmare"" poses a serviceable enough mystery for viewers to puzzle over. Who, for example, is that staring menacingly out of the jungle of Eden on the CET machine's view screen? What's the connection between Mandrels and vraxoin? Other less tantalizing mysteries defy solution: why does Lewis Fiander (Tryst) insist on speaking his lines in a silly German accent? Why does Jennifer Lonsdale deliver such a completely flatline performance as his assistant, Della? The mind boggles.",1343952000,2,2893,5.226293103448276
1199135,5,B00000AOAV,"In the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who entitled ""NIghtmare of Eden"" a luxury linear has somehow come off course in hyperspace and begun to rematerialize with another ship at the same time.  Causing both ships to flux in and out of hyperspace at the same time.  If something isn't done soon both ships could be destroyed.  Fortunaly for all the intergaltic insurance adjusters have arrived.  Calling himself the Doctor along with Romana and thier trusty dog K-9.  No the Doctor hasn't stop traveling in time and space.  He discover's that the ships are in flux and they need to be seprated.  So he and Romana allow them to think they are agents to search the ship.  What they first discover is the navigation officer has been acting strange happy at first and then paranoid the next. Romana thinks he might be under the influence the Doctor agrees with her.
  Meanwhile on board is a zoological expidention that has recently left the planet Eden and Professor Kline and his people have just gotten the CET machine up and running while they wait for the buinsess with the ship to be concluded.  The Doctor is amazed that such a device is even being used since the princaples of it are so unsound.  This of course this makes the professor upset but still in good spirtis. The Doctor decides to investigate on his own with the aid of K-9 and discovers that the naviagtor was given Raxoan one of the most dangerous drugs in the universe.  So dangerous was it that many worlds banded together and destroyed the only source of it so that none could ever be made again.  Yet somehow it has come on board.  The Doctor begins to wonder if the ship was in an acident at all now.
  Romana also discovers that Kline's expidetion had one death and resulted in the expidtion ending earlier then it was supposed to be.  Romana begins to wonder if in fact the expidtion is a cover for omething else.  With the Doctor working with the Captain of the linear to get the ships seperated they go to an effectted part of the ship and discover a wild animal on board something that wasn't being shipped by them and the pilot of the other ship has no idea what they are talking about.  One of Kline's people discovers that the creature in question is a Mandrall Eden greatest predator.  What neither the Doctor, Romana or even Kline himself can figure out is why it is on board since no living speciemens were taken save for what the CET machine recorded.
  Will the Doctor be able to figure out how to get the ships seprated before it is too late?  Can he figure out what the drug Raxoan have to do with this as well?  And what do the Mandrall's have to do with being loose on the ship will all of this?  Has the Doctor gotten to many mysteries to solve at once or will it finally do him in?  Check out in Doctor Who ""The Nightmare of Eden"" to find out.
  Now to mention one thing that was a bit of a disappointment was the fact that this Doctor Who epsidoe did not have new CGI effects in note the ships colliding with each other or some of the scenes in which you see the other ship.  Other then that the standard commentary along with a few documentries about the epsidoes themselves.",1340928000,,3159,4.396551724137931
1199136,3,B00000AOAV,"Nightmare of Eden is an interesting little conundrum. The story is actually quite interesting. However, in contrast to the interesting story you have some less than effective monster costumes, a couple of poor performances, and a lack of direction.

First for the story, I think that Bob Baker created a taut little thriller for his first, and only, solo story for Doctor Who: two spaceships are fused together when they accidentally materialize in the same place at the same time. First, there is the problem of trying to separate these two ships especially since it's difficult because of spatial instability where the ships overlap. Then you have a mystery about who is smuggling drugs, with a storyline that shows the dangers of drug use and addiction. You also have a subplot with an unstable virtual zoo (somewhat like the machine in Carnival of Monsters), and a few cheap shots at package vacations and insurance adjustors.

Unfortunately, this story was let down by the realities of budget constraints (the ridiculous Mandrells); the fact that this was created in 1979 (costumes...); a director that allowed some over-the-top performances (the character of Tryst and at least some of Tom Baker's scenes). Actually, after listening to all of the problems they had making this story, I'm impressed it turned out as well as it did. The Mandrells could possibly been saved if they had only been filmed in low-light settings like the jungle set, but to have them trundling through the very brightly lit spaceship corridors really showed their shortcomings. As for the comment about 1979: let's be honest the disco space wear just really hasn't aged well, in fact this is a problem that both this story and Destiny of the Daleks had in common. The crew of the starcruiser looked like escapees from a Village People concert, and so did the excise men for that matter. Finally, for the performances this story really needed a stronger director and/or producer: Lewis Flander, playing the scientist Tryst, should not have been allowed to use such a stereotypical accent. No other character had any sort of noticeable accent, so the fact that only one character had an accent stood out like a sore thumb. Also, I think Tom Baker needed a stronger personality to rein in some of his tendencies, the most glaring example is the way over-the-top scene where the Doctor leads the Mandrells back into the projection, then moans about his arm, his leg, his everything from offscreen...

On the positive side, Tom Baker beautifully underplayed a couple of scenes to great affect: the best instance is the scene where Tryst tries to validate his actions, and the Doctor quietly tells him to ""Go away."" Lalla Ward has grown quite comfortable in her role as Romana, and is nearly the Doctor's equal. Also, since Bob Baker, one of the creators of the K-9 character, wrote the story, K-9 was used to good affect in this story. There were also a couple of nice supporting performances, most notably David Daker as the spaceship captain who slowly descends into drug addiction; his role was very subtly and effectively played.

The extras could have been quite interesting, because it sounds like there were a lot of very strong memories about the difficulties in creating this story. Unfortunately, the extra features felt like they were slapped quickly together, and are a bit on the shoddy side. The first extra is a very short interview with Bob Baker discussing what it was like to write his only solo Doctor Who story. ""The Nightmare of Television Centre"" discusses the many problems encountered trying to finish this story. Again this was quite interesting, but it felt too short, and from listening to the commentary it seemed that this story had left an indelible mark on most of those involved with its production, so I would have to assume it could have been expanded even though the director and producer are no longer with us. There is also an interview with Lalla Ward from a show called Ask Aspell which was done around the time that this story was either filmed or being shown, which is kind of fun. Of course there is the usual photo gallery, production information subtitles, and Radio Times information. Finally there is an odd extra called ""The Doctor's Strange Love"" which really comes off as a fan panel from a Doctor Who convention. The most annoying thing about the fan panel bit is that it was longer than the making of featurette, ""Nightmare of Television Centre.""

The commentary option was pretty good. Toby Hadoke once again moderates a group of people who rotate through the booth. The biggest bonus is that someone must have had a talk with Lalla Ward, and told her to take it down a notch or three in her comments about Tom Baker. While she obviously still doesn't have warm and fuzzy feelings towards Tom Baker, her discussions of him on the commentary primarily focus on his commitment to the program, and how seriously he took the role. (A welcome relief after the other commentary tracks that I've heard with Lalla Ward.) Also contributing to the commentary was Bob Baker, the writer; Colin Mapson, effects designer; Joan Stribling, make-up designer; and Peter Craze, who played a customs inspector. It's a lively group that covers a lot of aspects of the production and there were some interesting discussions about the various eras of the show that each had worked on. Peter Craze is also the brother of the late Michael Craze who played a companion to Patrick Troughton's Doctor, and gave an insight into how this show and it's fandom had affected his brother's life.

While I think the story could have qualified for a 4, its' production was less than optimal and brings it down to a 3. (Somewhat similar to how I felt about Creature from the Pit, an interesting story that was tremendously let down by production values and a few performances). But for rating the DVD release, I feel you also need to consider the extras, and the extras are rather lackluster giving this DVD an overall rating of 3. This really isn't a must-have story, but it definitely has its moments. So, should you buy it? Well, that really depends. If you are just trying to collect a few essential stories from each Doctor, then you can bypass this story. It's interesting, but definitely not essential. If you're a big Tom Baker fan, then you'll probably want this, however I would probably wait a bit to see if the price drops.",1339804800,2,6427,4.8223028105167725
1199137,4,B00000AOAV,"This has a reputation among Doctor Who fans as one of the worst stories from the classic years but I for one think it is one of the best. It mixes a decent dose of Sci-Fi, and intriguing story concept and a moral message of ""don't do drugs."" It has a little humor thanks to Douglas Adams' script editing contributions and while the special effects and the monsters are typically cheesy, setting it on a spaceship made it much more palatable.

The extras on this DVD are nothing special, which is why I did not give this 5 stars. One of the things I love about buying the classic DVD's is watching the extras.  There were a couple pieces on the cheesy effects and the storyline.  I really did not care for the fan discussion piece. Tom Baker is not involved with the commentary but Lalla Ward is.  But I only watch the extras right after I buy it and usually never again. This is one of the previously unreleased DVD's I have been waiting for so I am pleased that it has finally come out.",1336867200,4,987,4.290322580645161
1199138,3,B00000AOAV,"I feel I should address a matter of concern before beginning this review.  Someone commented on my review of ""The Daemons"", thinking my review was phony since I posted it before its U.S. release.  Let me just say that you U.S. readers of my reviews get a special preview as to what you can expect to buy before the U.S. release, due to the fact that I have access to the U.K. versions, which are released weeks earlier than here in the States.  So please don't think I'm making up these reviews without actually seeing the releases just for the sake of trying to get my review posted sooner than most other people here in the U.S.

In addition, I believe that I'm going to have to admit that I may no longer be qualified to comment on ""improved"" picture quality, since my last review of ""The Daemons.""  This is due to the fact that since then, I have changed out my old, low-def, 4.3 aspect ratio TV, for a newer, 720, 16.9 aspect ratio TV, and I'm playing these on my Blu-Ray player, which up-converts the picture quality of DVDs.  The problem that I have noticed with watching these classic Doctor Who shows with this new set up, is that since they were not made for hi-def, they sometimes actually look WORSE on a hi-def TV played on a Blu-Ray player.  So I apologize for not being able to give you a rating on how much better the picture has improved on future reviews.  In my opinion, these classic episodes did look better with my old TV.  Alternatively, with some experimentation, I unboxed my old DVD player, and use yellow RCA video cable.  Since these produce a lower quality image, it's almost like watching this on my old TV, which ironically, now looks better.

Now on to Eden.  Well, as always, if you don't know the story by now, you're not going to learn it from me.  Any simple web search can tell you all about this, and since many other reviewers do a recap of the story, I won't.  I prefer to tell you about the bonus features and other extras which may help you decide if you want to make this a part of your collection.

Putting the audio and text commentaries aside, there are only four special features.  Let me clarify.  There are some other miscellaneous extras like the photo gallery and ""Coming Soon"" trailer, but really, how ""SPECIAL"" are those?  Regarding the text commentary, that is only interesting to the individual buyer.  Personally, I believe I have read every single one.  Now go ahead, and ""GEEK ME"" if you will.  As far as the audio commentary, I almost had to call my cardiologist when I heard Toby Hadoke once again moderating it.  Will there be no end to this suffering?  The contributing commentators, who were ACTUALLY A DIRECT CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF THIS SHOW AND DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE A PART OF THE COMMENTARY, are Lalla Ward (Romana), and Peter Craze (Costa), writer Bob Baker, effects designer Colin Mapson and make-up designer Joan Stribling.  I don't know about anyone else, but knowing the history of Lalla Ward and Tom Baker, I would give both of my hearts to hear them do a commentary track together.  But we all know, THAT will never happen, so once again, no Tom Baker on the commentary track.

As for the other special features, ""The Nightmare of Television Centre"", a making of feature, was to me, the most interesting of the four features, and regrettably too short for me.  ""Going Solo"", is an interview with writer Bob Baker.  I found that to be only mildly interesting.  ""The Doctor's Strange Love"", is yet another piece consisting of three people who once again had NOTHING to do with this program, sitting around and talking about  this story.  Who the hell gives a damn about this!  Paying for this DVD, and having this ""Special Feature"" is like having you pay me to read my reviews.  I find it insulting, and didn't even watch the whole thing because I was so fed up.  Finally, ""Ask Aspel"", is a nice little interview, featuring Lalla Ward, and was produced around the same time as ""Nightmare of Eden.

It was stated during interview that ""Nightmare of Eden"" was a low budget production back in the 70's, and I feel, after watching these so called ""special features,"" the production of this DVD was equally low budget, if not lower.  I would rate the show itself as 4 stars, partially due to my adoration of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, but rate the extras as 2 stars.  And so My Bottom Line is, any fan of the Tom Baker Era, as well as Lalla Ward, should SERIOUSLY CONSIDER adding this to their collection, but only for the purpose of watching the show itself.

I realize that this review was a bit longer than some people may have wished for, but I felt it was necessary to address a few matters which may affect future reviews.  I hope that this review was helpful to you, and please tell me your opinion(s) on my review so that I can hopefully improve upon future ones.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully, consider my humble opinion(s).",1333756800,19,4929,4.506756756756757
1199139,5,B00000AOAV,"The Tom Baker/Lalla Ward era seems to have split Doctor Who fans as either love it or hate it. If you liked Armegeddon Factor, Destiny of the Daleks, Creature from the Pit, The Horns of Nimon, or Meglos then you will like this one , too.
  The Doctor, Romana, K-9, good guys and bad guys all interact well in a fun and exciting adventure. Drug smugglers, an electronic zoo, and collided spaceships all wrapped in a well-written story.
  For some reason Amazon did not transfer the reviews from the web page they used prior to this pre-order web page. It has about 20 reviews with mostly 4 & 5 star ratings.",1330992000,5,606,4.4324324324324325
1199140,1,B00000AOAV,"Tom Baker is rightly remembered as the most important actor to play the Doctor in the show's original run. He was the longest-serving Doctor and broadened the show's appeal internationally. Quite a few of his stories are the best the classic series ever produced.

This ain't one of 'em.

'Nightmare of  Eden', along with 'Horns of Nimon' , 'Creature from the Pit' and 'Destiny of the Daleks' (all from the same season) are the very bottom-of-the-barrel dregs of the Tom Baker years.  Baker's ego was raging out of control behind the scenes and he did pretty much anything he wanted in front of the camera, whether it served the show or not.  Basically a lot of flailing around and mugging which would have better suited a silent comedy along with some ""I know this is stupid' wink-wink asides to the viewers.  On top of it all you have shaky production values, even by Who standards.

Another poster has already done a  summary of the story but, believe me, if the description sounds good it does not play out well on screen. Besides Baker's kitchen sink performance you have Lalla Ward's stilted Romana and cartoonish turns from the supporting cast, even actors who have been good in other Who appearances. The pacing is also way off. The Doctor's introduction in the story is particularly bad.  Two spaceships are fused in an accident and the Doctor wanders onto the ship's bridge mere moments later claiming to be an insurance adjustor and everyone accepts this without protest.  All very rushed and peremptory. It's as if all involved are thinking ""Let's just hurry up and get this over with"".  Awful, lazy plotting and clumsy direction.

If you're still curious do yourself a favor and watch the first episode on  Amazon, iTunes, or somewhere else online and then, in the unlikely event you wish to proceed, you can plonk down $18 for the DVD.

If you are relatively new to classic Doctor Who this is absolutely NOT the place to start.

For the best of Tom Baker select from his first 3 seasons (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Robot-Story-75/dp/B000QGE8II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Robot (Story 75)</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Talons-of-Weng-Chiang-Special-Edition-Story-91/dp/B0055ASXLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Talons of Weng-Chiang (Special Edition) (Story 91)</a>).

1199141,4,B00000AOAV,"I am a big Doctor Who fan, and purchase every episode as it comes out of DVD. If you're a casual viewer, though, this may not be one of the must-have episodes.

The story-line is pretty good. The spaceship ""Empress"" emerged from hyperspace in the exact spot where the spaceship ""Hecate"" already was. This caused the two ships to be locked together - intermingled, as the two ships co-exist in the same time and space. Not good. The Doctor, Romana and K-9 arrive, and set to separating the ships.

But there's something else going on. One of the Empress passengers is Tryst, a zoologist, who has a Continual Event Transmuter (CET). This gadget stores a part of a planet, its flora, fauna & minerals, on crystals, to be eventually ""projected"" (brought back to full physical size). Now that's the kind of toy that begs to be misused. And it is, and people die before the Doctor can put things back to right.

The costuming of the Mandrels has to be some of the worst costuming ever for a Doctor Who adversary, and depending on your point of view, that's a plus or a minus!

There isn't much well-placed humor, and I think it could have used it.  Tom Baker is my favorite of the classic Doctor Who's, but his companion in this episode, Romana (played by Lalla Ward), is not my favorite sidekick personality; she's usually too dry for me.

Here's a list of the extras, according to a British website:

1.  Digitally remastered picture and sound quality
2.  Commentary with actors Lalla Ward (Romana) and Peter Craze (Costa, a customs inspector), writer Bob Baker, effects designer Colin Mapson and make-up designer Joan Stribling. The commentary is moderated by Toby Hadoke (who was not involved with the episode.)
3.  The Nightmare of Television Centre - A look back at a somewhat troubled production with three of the behind-the-scenes crew who worked on it. There must have been some ""interesting"" times during the filming. Alan Bromly is credited as director, but he actually quit in the middle of production. Or, according to another source, ""his services were dispensed with"" by Graham Williams, the producer. Williams completed the episode as director (uncredited). In any case, the cause of Bromly's leaving (or the last straw) was a flaming row with star Tom Baker.
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) It sounds like there is near-unanimous agreement, in the commentary, that Alan Bromly didn't understand sci-fi or the type of show they were shooting.
4.  Going Solo - Writer Bob Baker talks about The Nightmare of Eden (originally titled ""Nightmare of Evil"")
5.  The Doctor's Strange Love with comedian Josie Long and writers Joe Lidster and Simon Guerrier
6.  Ask Aspel - Lalla Ward's appearance on the popular BBC children's show

1199142,5,B00000AOAV,"The Doctor & Romana era was my favorite era, classic or new, of Doctor Who. This adventure has a good story and is lots of fun. The two time lords are equals and their chemistry is wonderful. Highly repeatable watching, so please release it to DVD. There are only 3 or 4 more to go in the Tom Baker era.

1199144,5,B00000AOAV,"First off, ANYTHING with Tom Baker is good.  END OF DISCUSSION.  Those who pan the episode are totally off base.  Of course the sets and the costumes have flaws!  They ALWAYS have flaws.  It's the BBC for crying out loud.  Overall it's a great story and it's one of my favorites, probably because of all the humor.  You get the feeling that they just had a lot of fun with this one.  The tax men are appropriately wacky (in a bureaucratic way), Tom has innumerable funny quips that go by so fast you sometimes have to rewind to get them, and the ""silly"" scene at the end where he hams it up fighting with the monsters was just ... well, fun to watch.

Other people have given a good synopsis of the plot so I won't repeat it.  There's a reason why copies of this episode sell for so much.  It's a great Dr. Who story.  You don't critique Dr. Who episodes by judging the sets and costumes.  You look at the characters, the acting, and the overall story.  In this case, I liked everything.  The characters all had a lot of personality, they were all well acted, and the story was unique and very well done.  A terrific Dr. Who!",1194652800,3,1125,4.260663507109005
1199145,4,B00000AOAV,"One day, they will make a TV-movie about the October 2003 Staten Island Ferry disaster, and that movie will be atrocious.  Right before the ferry is about to crash, some actor, who's already seen ""Nightmare of Eden"", will utter the line, ""Oh no!"".  That's what actor David Daker did right before his character's starship collided with a space freighter.  It is not, on its face, a proud moment, or a good beginning for a story.
""Nightmare"" tops several ""Worst of"" lists in the ""Doctor Who"" pantheon.  Worst costumes, certainly.  There's not a single character in this piece who's dressed sensibly.  Starting at the top, Romana appears to be dressed in a gray maternity gown.  With red trim.  Most of the starship crew is dressed in leather: the ship's crewmen are wearing red sleeveless vests with glitter added.  And white pancake makeup, to boot.  The two federal agents whose comic banter takes over the second half of the story, are dressed like the biker from the Village People.  Tryst's team wears white T-shirts under black vests, so the only thing missing, cleary, is the rhinestone studding.  Daker's black jumpsuit has spandex sleeves.  I won't even get into what the starship passengers are wearing.  I fly coach three times a month and they just don't issue that at the departure gate.
The special effects are bad.  The opening shot is of a styrofoam spaceship wobbling its way across the stars.  There's a lot of experimental computer imaging in this 1979 epic, but explosions happen before the gun blasts which cause them, and after Della is shot in the neck, she famously falls to the floor clutching her midriff.
So why, then, is ""Nightmare of Eden"" so entertaining?  At what point does ""bad"" become ""good""?
Make no mistake, this is deep in the doldrums of Season 17.  There's the serious plot masked by the off-the-wall script.  Two spaceships collide, one still half in hyperspace.  The resulting dimensional instability causes a bunch of ape-like monsters wearing bell-bottoms to kill a dozen extras merely by brushing their elongated arms across the victims' heads.  Seriously, what is the message of ""Nightmare of Eden""?  With the customs agents trampling over everyone's civil rights, and the drugs giving several people a really bad trip (including, presumably, the director who quit and the costume designer), you could package this on the ""Starsky & Hutch"" DVD and it would seem right at home.
There are moments of great subtlety in the script.  Before Vraxoin is slipped into his Kool-Aid, Rigg is unusually competent for a ""Doctor Who"" starship captain.  He blows the Doctor's cover after just one scene, and holds his own on the witty banter front for several scenes after that.  Once he gets high, he gets to deliver some wickedly funny lines (""They were only economy class, what's all the fuss about?"").  The rest of the comedy is a little too broad (Geoffrey Hinsliff and Peter Craze are awful), and Lewis Fiander's accent remains baffling, but at least Fiander seems to be intentionally overacting, so I can take the joke.  I do not understand, however, why he pronounced the word ""three"" as ""ten"".  Or why customs officer Fisk is introduced as a ""Water Guard"".  There was no water in this story.  Again, it wasn't just Captain Rigg who was on the Vraxoin.
Tom Baker is completely off the wall.  He's already been much maligned for the ""Oh! My fingers! My arms! My legs! My everything! Ohh!"" shtick.  But he also bites into a phallic green appendage for the second story in a row (remember ""The Creature From the Pit""?) and tells us that it ""didn't taste at all bad.""  Lalla Ward remains the picture of confidence and competence.  Maybe she was having flashbacks to ""Hamlet"".
I come away from ""Nightmare"" with Lewis Fiander saying: ""We worked on this idea together, before he died, of course.  Then we stopped.""  If I close my eyes, I am having a great time.  And learning to brush my teeth after meals.",1078012800,12,3936,4.829596412556054

7905823,3,B00000AOAV,"A very troubled production and greatly missed potential.
The story and characters are weak and the producer wanted to save money which affected everything.
The sets are actually very good and the SFX are decent but the director Alan Bromly just didn't understand Doctor Who. So much so in fact he tired of the struggle and walked away!
Graham Williams the producer, had to step in and finish up.
This affected the actors, their performances are tense and uninspired.
There are some interesting concepts in this story and they are well represented but most of the characters dialogue is a waste of time.
In one scene the Doctor has to bite the root of a carnivorous plant that is attacking him and it sprays his face with juice and he tells Romana something like, ""You know, that doesn't taste at all bad.""
I am disappointed by the lack of intensity shown regarding drug addiction.
The loss of family, friends and one's own life really aren't discussed.
I think Heroin itself would have been a much more powerful drug of choice to represent.
Immobilizing and peaceful, it makes death attractive.
I can't think of any drug more evil and misleading.
The Mandrel creatures whose bodies become the drug Vraxoin when they die are ridiculous Muppet looking humanoids.
A very poor cost cutting measure.
Considering what potential they have they should be horrible demons, not child friendly cartoons.
The planet Eden itself looks more like a WalMart Garden Center, not the Biblical Garden Of Eden.
This story may have had good intentions at the beginning but I don't think they happened, not effectively anyway.
I do like the Professor Tryst character even though he is a smuggler/dealer, he reminds me of Peter Fonda and Peter Sellers.

There is a photo of a model set used in the Guardian Of Piri episode of SPACE:1999 to illustrate the capabilities of Professor Tryst's CET device.
Another cost cutting measure.

This may be the worst Tom Baker story ever and if so it really isn't saying much. It is still enjoyable.
I just see it as mediocre Saturday Morning kid stuff like Sid & Marty Krofft's work.
