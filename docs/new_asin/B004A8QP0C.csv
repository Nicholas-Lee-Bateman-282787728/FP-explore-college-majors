8419626,1,B004A8QP0C,"This is a documentary of the infamous prison on the so-called Devil's Island.  Some of it was shot in super-8 and the rest looks like 16mm at best.  The point is that the source information was not even standard definition quality - good example of greed here - it was sold as a blu-ray disk simply to get more money for it.  The film is blurred and low resolution.  I don't know how they can say ""1080p"" on the jacket.  Don't buy.",1372377600,5,431,4.2073170731707314
