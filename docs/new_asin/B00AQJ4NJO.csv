5471155,5,B00AQJ4NJO,We absolutely loved this.  I got it for my husband for his birthday.  Richard Hammond did a great job with it.,1377734400,,110,4.190476190476191
5471156,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"Entertaining and informative, fans of the show will certainly love this focus on vehicles made famous by the legendary 007.",1377216000,,123,5.2
5471157,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"Great fun to ""review"" all the cars and the evolving of the ""special"" additions.  Realized we had missed some of the movies.",1376265600,,123,4.590909090909091
5471158,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"5 stars is not enough, this is awesome!!!! These folks do a great job anyway but with this one they whet over the top.
Great photography, great stories, even a few Bonds show up. Highly recommended.",1371859200,,198,4.527777777777778
5471159,5,B00AQJ4NJO,Not only am I a huge bond fan but a top gear fan. This was an awesome DVD. Lots of fun and very interesting!,1367452800,,108,3.5416666666666665
5471160,4,B00AQJ4NJO,"I bought this for my husband and he's watched it at least twice. I've watched it once with him. I found the history of Bond cars interesting (as we've watched all the Bond films over the years) and Richard Hammond (one of the Top Gear presenters) does a good job with the interviews and descriptions of the cars. All the Bond movies are mentioned, even the latest one, Skyfall. Jeremy Clarkson and James May from the Top Gear series aren't in this DVD, but I didn't expect them to be. Happy with our purchase.",1366502400,2,509,4.425531914893617
5471161,1,B00AQJ4NJO,First off... this sells for a dollar and a half cheaper at our local Wal Mart. I almost bought it for my man but he said he saw it on tv and it was pretty boring. Also did not think it was worth 7.50 for only an hour episode.,1361577600,2,225,3.6122448979591835
5471162,3,B00AQJ4NJO,"This looks to be the special as shown on television, which was enjoyable.  I might have wished for slightly more time on the bit where they constructed a fully working Lotus submarine, but they were trying to keep the time of the show within an hour for broadcast.

The Product Details list a run time of 135 minutes though, which was over twice the length of the broadcast special.  This suggested that there would be extras on this or would be an extended version of the special.  The DVD though only lists a run time of 60 minutes and doesn't list any extras.  Don't be fooled by the run time listing in the product details. Still, for the price it's not a bad deal.",1360627200,10,669,4.362903225806452
8556384,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"This is a very enjoyable documentary about Bond cars from Sean Connery's tenure in the 1960s to Daniel Craig's in the 2000s.  Richard Hammond is the only presenter on this, so it's not as funny as the shows with Clarkson and May, but still worth a look if you can find a copy.",1457136000,,276,4.2075471698113205
8556385,5,B00AQJ4NJO,Everything you want for Bond lovers and car lovers in one DVD.,1431993600,,62,4.25
8556386,5,B00AQJ4NJO,Thank you!!,1430870400,,11,5.0
8556387,5,B00AQJ4NJO,Given as a gift to my son. Great feedback from him. He loves it!,1424822400,,64,3.642857142857143
8556388,5,B00AQJ4NJO,A gift that was well received,1421020800,,29,4.0
8556389,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"My boyfriend loved this special of Top Gear! It was shorter than I expected, and boring (to me), but he found it fascinating and true to the Bond franchise. He says he wishes they would have highlighted some other cars and less others, but overall he liked it!",1419984000,,260,4.4375
8556390,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"I don't like cars, I don't understand cars, I don't care about cars. But I could watch this show every day and be happy. Great episode in particular if you love/like/are even moderately interested in Bond. Personally, I think Bond is scum. But the episode was cool. Bought this for my Bond-loving dad, he really got a kick out of it.",1393372800,,333,4.475409836065574
8556391,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"Richard Hammond is great in this and leads us down an often thought about, but never explored path behind the lineage and trivia of Bond's great cars. I never knew how much I didn't know, or how close we all came to seeing Bind pull up in a, gasp, Bentley!

And of course, they use the typical Top Gear treatment to turn this into a fun ride - and they make the submarine car from The Spy Who Loved Me - the Lotus Esprit!",1392768000,,421,4.011904761904762
8556392,5,B00AQJ4NJO,This was exactly what I wanted and it came in great condition. I love watching this show. Thank you very much.,1387238400,,110,4.285714285714286
8556393,5,B00AQJ4NJO,"I've been a Bond fan since Bond showed up at the cinema.  I enjoy Top Gear when I have the opportunity to watch it.  Having Richard Hammond give a history of Bond cars is a brilliant idea.  He covered a lot of material, gave some behind the scenes details that are hard to come by and even included a Top Gear style project in the mix.  There were some Bond cars not included in the story that I wish had been there.  But the contents of this DVD will be viewed again and again.",1380672000,,478,4.042553191489362
