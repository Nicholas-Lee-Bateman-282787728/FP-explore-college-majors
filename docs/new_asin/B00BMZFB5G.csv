8571249,5,B00BMZFB5G,"Five HUMOROUS Stars. Monique Marvez: Not Skinny Not Blonde is a hilarious appearance by the frank, irreverent mature comedienne (with the young boyfriend) dishing in front of a large, live audience at the California Theatre of the Performing Arts in San Bernardino, Ca, which is obviously enjoying it all. Using lots of audience participation, she gives her very personal views on relationships between men and women, food and women, divorce, focusing a great deal on sex, pursuit between the sexes, maintenance of relationships, her dog, cooking, and more. Loaded with many I cant believe she said that in public moments. Produced and directed by Scott Montoya. Highly Recommended. Five PERCEPTIVE Stars. (LOL Flix Standup Comedy Films Inc. Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. Time-59:44.)",1525564800,,782,5.365853658536586

8571251,4,B00BMZFB5G,"This chic is abs hilarious! I find most women boring, dull, self absorbed and well you get the picture....  I first heard Monique on her Saturday night Radio Show on KFI 640AM in LA,wow,  talk about LOL.  I never schedule around a radio show but for her I do.  She recently mentioned this Show is available on Amazon Prime and was pretty humble about it all, like hey check it out if you wanna. What? I would be selling my act to Kingdom Come (sp???) if it were this good, get that PR machine rolling cupcake!

Monique has a unique perspective in that she is gorgeous, gifted but wise and wants to share it all.  High recommend for some provocative female insight, shocking commentary and most of all, truthful.  One of a kind gal here folks, don't miss it.",1517097600,,757,4.402877697841727

8571257,1,B00BMZFB5G,"Monique's been married and divorced 3 X's, now shacked up with a teenager - all she talks about is what's in her head -  sex, she's a loser but believes she's funny and on top of that she thinks she's entertaining.  She opens up her life like speeding bullets and it's all a disaster - and people laugh.  People who raise themselves up out of the chaos of living for and worshiping the flesh regret the degrading nature they once had while women like Monique continue to think and act like what they allowed themselves to become instead of becoming what God created them to be.  She looks,sounds and acts like a retired whore who has found a different outlet to do the same thing that she did in her younger years.  Instead of getting paid to ""do"" it, she's getting paid to talk about it.  Those who find a life lived without God to be funny are simply living that same way themselves.  How does one know these things?  When you recognize what you broke away from and no longer are.",1505606400,,982,4.357142857142857
