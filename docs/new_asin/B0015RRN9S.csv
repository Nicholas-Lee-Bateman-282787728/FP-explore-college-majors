8259646,5,B0015RRN9S,"This movie is really strong, you can really feel the character Jamie (Michael J Fox) suffering in this. Left by his wife, heavy into drugs and drinking. He is in really bad shape. His friend(?) Allagash (Kiefer Sutherland) is a really party-goer and is his friendship superficial ? Questions you ask yourselves. Have hanged out with guys like Allagash so i can relate to that relationship.
There are very emotional scenes in this, Jamie learning his ex-wife is in town and goes to one of her modeling shows drunk and trying to get an explanation why she left him, she coldly ignores him. And he gets thrown out.
I don't want to give up to much about the story but there is one even stronger scene in the end when he gets contact with his ex. I could relate to many things in this movie and it's probably why I like it so much.

The commentary track is one of the best I've heard.

Audio is DD Surround and it is really sweet to have the eighties back in the room.

Buy it !",1408665600,4,973,4.2771739130434785

However, attraction to drugs kicked him out of all and, as mother of him is ill, he is of no need to anyone.

Quite clich this story is.",1405987200,,208,3.7045454545454546

8259649,2,B0015RRN9S,"This movie is an excellent case in point.  A great book (I thought) turned out to be a mediocre movie.  the movie follows the book, without alteration and with very few unexpected cinematic choices.  Though some books make amazing movies, this was not one of them.",1390003200,,264,4.695652173913044
8259650,4,B0015RRN9S,"This movie illustrates the sad fact of drug abuse and all the damage that is done.

Tracy Pollan is sweet in it as the love interest.

What I like was seeing a young Kiefer Sutherland getting his acting chops
who was all too believable as the friend that is too self centered.

Overall, I just found it depressing.  I want to be entertained by movies
not demoralized.  But for what it is, it hit its mark as a cautionary tale.",1376956800,,426,4.275
8259651,3,B0015RRN9S,"I love the fact that Tom Cruise passed on this, solely because I didn't know that while I was watching the film and the whole time I kept thinking that Michael J. Fox reminded me of a young Tom Cruise.  His mannerisms, charisma, delivery; everything just felt very much like 80's Tom Cruise.  That is not a bad thing.  Think what you will of Mr. Cruise, but he certainly draws in your eye.

Jay McInerney broke out in the 80's as one of those young, tortured writers who exploited his own vices through the printed page.  He was friends with Bret Easton Ellis (that should say a lot) and so his books were met with the same amount of intrigue and caution.  He just went for it.  I have not read `Bright Lights, Big City', but I have a feeling that this big screen adaptation is a lot lighter in tone and is cushioned so as not to be too forthright.  Look at what they did to Ellis's own `Less Than Zero' the year before.  Gutted it and made it a Lifetime movie.  `Bright Lights, Big City' feels like it is mellowed out.  Still, there is some great moments here (`Less Than Zero' had a few itself) and so it shouldn't be avoided altogether, despite many considering it forgettable entertainment.

The cast is rather impressive.  Michael J. Fox makes the most of a mature role and really nails some vital scenes (his longwinded drunk rant about his wife is perfection) and his narration (which bookends the film) is spot on.  The film is stolen by Kiefer Sutherland though.  His arrogant, self-centered yet manipulative best friend Tad is a sensational scene stealer, especially in the film's earlier moments.  He slides through his dialog with ease and never once flinches an acting muscle.  He just IS.

Still, the pacing has issues and there are segments in the film's core that feel empty and unnecessary.  The idea that Jamie is throwing his life away in nights of debauchery with coke and booze is lightened to such a point that the audience never really gets into the thrust of his decline.  It feels sugarcoated.  Maybe it was the studios really aching to get a crowd or maybe it was the star not wanting to look too immoral, but the depictions of drug use never feel gritty enough.  While we can feel his despair and depression, it is based on outside influences (his mother, his wife) and not directly related to the powder going up his nose.

It is worth a gander, but it doesn't say what it wants to say and that is a shame.",1374624000,,2434,4.469387755102041
8259652,5,B0015RRN9S,Anybody who has lost themselves in the lifestyle of drugs & partying can relate to this movie. Micheal J Fox performance was phenomenal,1364860800,5,135,4.913043478260869
8259653,2,B0015RRN9S,"Stripped of the author's light, spicy prose, and left with just the thin story and some arch dialogue, Jay McInerney's go-go 80's New York novelette falls flat.

Michael J. Fox is earnest but miscast as an irresponsible fact-checker for a version of The New Yorker, and director James Bridges tackled coked-up yuppie disillusion with infinitely more heft in his film ""Mike's Murder"" four years earlier.

""Lights"" has aged better than ""St. Elmo's Fire"" or ""About Last Night..."" But it's worth noting Fox's character decides to stop having fun in the film's last scene, a half-assed happy ending in which the protagonist gazes optimistically at the World Trade Center towers in the distance.",1304812800,,689,5.142857142857143
