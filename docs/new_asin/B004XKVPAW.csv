4496497,5,B004XKVPAW,This is an awesome series that I just LOVE. Ages over 14. Can't wait to get the second series and I wish they would make more. It's just a awesome storyline with so many twists and turns! Great entertainment.,1291161600,,208,4.358974358974359
4496498,5,B004XKVPAW,"This was the best DARK romantic vampire series that I have ever seen.  There is an excellent plot, there's no throw away episodes.  It leads to a very surprising ending.  You could almost consider this a Drama.  It has humor that lightens it and makes you laugh, but also some areas that are real tear jerkers.  The manga is not bad either.  The second season Vampire Knights Guilty is out also and it is a direct continuation of season one.  Just as good.

This is excellent for people who love Vampire stories.  The ANIMATION itself IS EXCELLENT!!!!",1285200000,16,551,4.597938144329897

DvD seem to have come loose from it's hold, though it did not have any scratches which is a good thing.  Will definitely buy again when new episodes come out!!",1330646400,,283,4.714285714285714

4496507,5,B004XKVPAW,I love the series and you will love it to. If you love the first season you will defently love the second season. The drawback of course is it too short. Four episode is not long enough. See it. See it.,1302652800,,202,3.951219512195122
4496508,4,B004XKVPAW,"As we continue one of the most popular serise in the world of anime, it is the 3rd vol. that the fears and secrets of Yuki, Zerro, and Kaname begin to unfold. The world of humans and vampires begins to spiral into a self procamed battle it seems, by the three individuals. but that was just how I seeemed to portray these episodes. I know im not making much sence but your best just getting it yourselves.
  I still refuse to watch the english version, even if I know the voice actors. They just don't fit the characters >( And as always, the characters are supper hot. All the same...I'm waiting to get payed so I may continue my collection.",1296345600,2,642,4.341666666666667

8447135,5,B004XKVPAW,"I totally love anime vampires if you do to then you will love this stylishly done very imaginative series. Brilliant charismatic characters Kaname is my fav he's the handsome quiet reserved always calm cool collected rarely loses control vampire king. This has episodes 9 to 13, it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. For those who haven't yet seen the second series [ Vampire Knight Guilty ] picks up where [ Vampire Knight ] left off this continuation of the series gives lots of insight about what happened with the characters and the coming as well as surprising events, I highly reccomend it I love it so much I bought both series here.

8447137,5,B004XKVPAW,"I love this anime, I got it before it was english subbed and I have to say it was one of the hardest anime's to read.  I mean it was impossible they talked so fast I had to keep pausing it and I watch a lot of anime and foreign films.  But I liked it so much that when it came out in english, I bought the whole thing all over again and enjoyed it even more.",1362182400,,358,3.6363636363636362
