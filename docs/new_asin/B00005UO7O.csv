1667065,5,B00005UO7O,"I have just recently became a fan of Hong Kong movies.  I picked this one up because I love Leon Lai's movies.  This is a tragic love story that involves college sweethearts who go their seperate ways only to meet again almost 20 years later.  Although both are married with children, you cannot help but want them to be together.  And, as their children put the pieces together, you begin to see them as their own parents.  This is a must for those who like classic and sentimental love stories that require a lot of kleenex!  You will not be disappointed!",1030406400,26,557,4.465346534653466
1667110,2,B00005UO7O,"Although the movie appears to be a love tragic story, it was also a story of betrayal and deceit. It's not easy to glorify affairs outside of marriage, but here it's done beautifully, lulling the viewer into believing it's okay to cheat as long as you love each other.  Missed timing is regretful, however, you can never go back, you can only decided now, and it was a selfish move.
I also found it interesting the story was told through meeting of their children, and never showed the emotional struggle and heart ache of the remaining spouses.",1466208000,,545,4.618556701030927

1667142,3,B00005UO7O,"This tragic love story is complicated.  Lots of jumping from present to past to present to past, over and over again.  Leon Lai and Qi Shu seem to do a lot of movies together, even music videos.  This is one of their better works.  The period is 1997 when Great Britain returns Hong Kong to China.  During this time, many Hong Kong people fled to other western nations including the United States, Canada and Great Britain.  The story begins with Leon's and Qi's characters in Great Britain to celebrate New Year's together.  While rushing to watch the fireworks, the two are killed in a car accident.  Leon has a son with a wife, and Qi has a daughter with a husband.  It turns out that the two were having an affair outside of their marriages.  Due to their deaths, the son and daughter come together to discover their parents past.  Their parents had fallen in love while in high school and they were first loves to each other, but was separated as their lives took different paths, and later came back together after they were each married to others.  As romantic as this story is, there are some questionable morals.  They were married to others, so should they have stepped into this affair, especially a secret one in which they even bought a house in Hong Kong that they shared together during so called business trips?  In addition, their son and daughter in discovery of their parents' past also fall in love with each other; are they brother and sister developing a love relationship?  Somehow we forget that there are some major wrongs in this storyline, yet we accept that the characters are all in love.  Should we approve those who fall in love via affairs?  Should we approve the sensual love between brother and sister?  Maybe not, yet most reviewers only see this movie as romantic rather than disgusting.  Should love be blind to relative relationships?",1446681600,2,1872,4.669724770642202

1667221,4,B00005UO7O,"The story of this movie is set in the University of Hong Kong during early to mid 1970's. At that time the University of Hong Kong was the most elite college not only in Hong Kong, but within East Asia. Leon Lai plays a student resident at Ricci Hall, an all male dormitory, while Shu Qi is a resident in the neighboring Ho Tung Hall, an all female dormitory. Their first encounter evolves around a long held tradition in the ""orientation"" ( which is in effect hazing)  of freshman resident to these Halls. Freshman from Ricci have to invade Ho Tung Hall, & fetch the gong used to summon students to dinner. On the way to the gong, they will be pelleted by water ladies of Ho Tung throw from bowls and wash basins.
Only a few know of this tradition, & even fewer were fortunate enough to experience it. Their love story, therefore, was founded on a very elitist circumstance. Both went on to become successful businessperson when they met again in 1996, and enjoyed all the trappings of wealth, flying small planes, setting up a love nest in upmarket Pokfulam area of Hong Kong, and jet-setting until their tragic death in London on new years eve of 1997.
It appears to be a nostalgic production by somebody who fondly reminiscences those golden days, perhaps somebody who was a resident of either  the 2 Halls.
While the storyline is so elitist that it may not resonant with the majority of its audience, the dram itself was highly enjoyable and touching. It is not a production expected to reap major box office reward, and the producer must be appreciated for his/her effort at this heart-warming piece of nostalgia.",1416182400,,1619,4.618055555555555
1667222,2,B00005UO7O,"I'm a fan of Asian film... but not this. An extended love relationship outside of marriage is ended by accident. Sad enough, sadder still is that the film missed opportunities... for surviving family members to explore the complexities and discover substance in the lives of the dead lovers... and perhaps examine their own lives in the aftermath. A great premise for exploration of the human heart was treated as an assembly of hopeful and anguished romantic moments. To sweeten the mood, a secondary romance was pasted on top. The actors were fine, but couldn't salvage the disjointed footage. If you love a romantic tableau, or a series of them, this is for you. If you're looking a story well told, revealing more as it leads to a conclusion... look elsewhere.",1414540800,,764,4.884615384615385
1667223,3,B00005UO7O,"As a film kinda poorly done but yet a really sweet timeless love story that will appeal to those who have a few years of adult life under their belts.  Lots of it, especially, the first half is pretty cheesy and hard to follow and I found myself skipping ahead alot.  However, it did pull me in and I stuck it out through the second half and glad I did.  The story is about two lovers, perhaps soul mates who get pulled apart by life as they move into adulthood and find each other years later after both are married with children.  I give this movie 9 hankies, lol.",1414281600,,566,4.165137614678899
1667224,1,B00005UO7O,Too predictable and poor performances.,1413936000,,38,6.8
1667225,3,B00005UO7O,"Oh, geez was there a story here somewhere?. I cant remember. I think i'll go revive my brain and go watch something simple to follow like Christoper Nola's Inception. Oh, and just as a little cavat emptor, the main characters are killed in the opening of the film, which in my opinion is a big no no in film. (I have only see a movie that is told after killing the protaganist of the film once in my lifetime. That was in David Lean's Laurence of arabia. Sorry, but City of lead blew it as soon as the film began. Laters. I am going for a walk and eat a bowl of cereal to clear my head.",1412121600,,586,4.017094017094017
1667226,5,B00005UO7O,"This imaginative offering by Andrew Lau of two ill-fated lovers (Leon Lai/Shu Qi)(torn by career and time seals the universal appeal of Shu Qi (also fabulous in ""A Beautiful Life"") which should have gotten Hollywood's attention better than a bit part in a male/male action flick (""Transporter"") which makes about as much sense as having Vivien Leigh follow up ""Gone With the Wind"" with ""Cannonball Run."" For those who watched the studio-contrived ""The Way We Were"" and winced their way through it, this is a more appealing and believable script (by Alex Law and Cheung Yuen-ting)depicting how life often interferes with romance. The story is wonderfully cast and superbly photographed on locale in Hong Kong and London.told wonderfully by their descendants with imagination and surprise. Another appealing element lies in the soundtrack, especially during a poignant dinner to the harmonies of the folk classic ""Try to Remember"" (original version: The Brothers Four) and sung another way in the film to great delight. This film will appeal to anyone tiring of plastic girls, plastic smiles, forced nudity and buddy-buddy chase movies from Hollywood. Turn down the lights, take 5 hankies out and pick up some tips on setting the mood for life, which is done mostly by adults with their clothes on. Believe it or not.",1393632000,12,1315,5.120930232558139
1667227,5,B00005UO7O,"I'm a fan of Shu Qi, the woman from the movie Transporter, which is why I bought this movie without even knowing if it was worth it or not. But since I've liked most of her other movies I figured would this one would probably be pretty good too. I wasn't disappointed.

I thought the acting was excellent, and I also enjoyed the selection of music. The story was easy to follow, and not just because you already know the ending.

I don't think enough asian films are given their fair share of credit here in america, which is a shame because this film should be on most peoples list of movies to see, And I'm a guy who doesn't watch many ""chick flicks"".",1233878400,6,653,4.258064516129032
1667228,4,B00005UO7O,"This is truly a great love story. A really wonderful story with great acting that touches the heart. It kept me thinking about it for days after i saw it.

7955212,4,B00005UO7O,"It is a very romantic story - the story is complex and interesting and it's always wonderful to be able to see events spanned over several decades, to get the historical perspective .
