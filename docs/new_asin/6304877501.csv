937540,2,6304877501,"Oh my, not good.  Not good at all. While the first Toxic Avenger was a very ""good"" movie that still holds up today, none of the sequels even came close.  Both parts two and three were filmed at the same time and were meant to be one film.  But they turned it into two separate movies when they realized the had such an overflow of crap.  Even Lloyd Kaufman said that he made this and part three just to turn a quick buck.

I'd rather watch Redneck Zombies or Beware! Children at Play before Toxic Avenger Part II.",1261440000,,513,4.1938775510204085
937541,3,6304877501,"I was eagerly excited when I rented this Film from the movie store. I was expecting more blood and gore than the first but was a bit upset that It didn't. The Toxic Avenger Part 2 had some very memorable scenes such as when Toxie turns a midget into a basketball, pulls a guy's both arms off with his mop, crushes a guy with a wheelchair, burns a Japanese guys nose into the shape of a fish, makes ramen noodles from a fat Tokyo thug, kills a ninja with a starfish, cuts another ninja in half with a bush whacker while he cut's the other ones fingers off. This installment of the toxic avenger is the funniest of them all and even though it's not the greatest, it still has a space in my VHS collection. If you want to see more of my reviews on the other movies, I go into detail on what the goer scenes are. Rent it if you come across part 2 or simply buy it for $5.00. It's worth some laughs. GET THE DIRECTORS CUT!!! THIS ONE HERE IS NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT!!! The R-Rated Version SUCKS!!",1148256000,,989,4.129533678756476
937542,5,6304877501,"Is it in this one or the first one that he finds a wife?  Can it happen to a nicer guy all in one video!  Toxi has a wife who is buxom, beautiful and blind, but she doesn't care because she loves him as he fights crime and drinks drano.  (Sometimes it gives him a little gas.  'Die sonne sheint...')
  If you have the first Toxic avenger, go for the gold and get the sequel.  If you're not sorry you bought it the first time, you won't be this time around either.",1015632000,2,463,3.967391304347826
937543,3,6304877501,A fairly good Sequel that has our toxie going to Japan to find his father and then return home to battle the evil Apocalpyse Inc. Not as good as the original but still worth rental fee. This one is toned down a lot more than  the original so most of the blood and gore is absent from this film but  other than that its a very entertaining movie that is worth a view or two,960768000,2,372,3.9466666666666668

937662,2,6304877501,"With the sequel to the surprise hit The Toxic Avenger, the simple tale of revenge becomes a globe trotting adventure.  Unfortunately, the sequel just doesn't have the same fun factor that the first film had.

I originally saw this movie when I was a kid.  Which, honestly, this movie is basically a kids film when you take out the nudity and violence.  But I only really remembered the first ten minutes of the film.  And there is a reason for that.  The movie gets seriously boring after the first fight scene.

The bulk of the film is basically vignettes of a corporation taking over Tromaville in the most manifested way, while Japanese citizens run away from Toxie.  Over and over again.  There's a subplot about him finding his dad which really just sounds like an excuse for the production team to go on vacation.

A lot of the jokes are tired stereotypes.  And the psoriatic fight scenes have lost a lot of impact from the first film.  There's a over reliance on cartoonish effects, but visually and audibly.  This would work if it were actually funny, but it's tiresome after 30 consecutive minutes of it.

The major problem is the bulk of this movie is just not compelling even as a dumb popcorn flick because it's so boring.  It's obvious that this was to be a serious attempt at a franchise movie, seeing as how the movie has a real budget, at least for an indie film, and how they were trying to world build for sequels this time  But the story that it tells is just not compelling

Now it's not all bad.  There are some good scenes in the movie.  And, depending on what version of the film you are watching, there are some really creative and well done gore effects.  Sadly, this version has much of the violence cut out.  I knew something was up when there were several deaths in the opening fight that I vividly remembered as a child, that were cut entirely.

Funnily, near as I can tell, all of the nudity is intact.  And there is a decent amount of it.  Which is weird, since if you've seen a television edit of an R rated film, generally the nudity and language is cut before the violence.  Which is really just a quirk of American censorship, but meh.  The most recent Rambo movie didn't cut any of the violence, just the language.  So it's weird seeing edits go completely in the other direction.

Overall, this particular version of the film is just okay for your action schlock, but it's done worse with all of the edits.  I would recommend finding the unedited version of this film if you plan to watch it.  While I don't know if it improves the movie that much, it still feels gutted in this form.",1446681600,,2621,4.445378151260504

937667,2,6304877501,"I was very excited for this bluray release and held off on getting the 88 films version. I watched the bluray today on a 56 inch HDTV and the quality of this bluray is a mixed bag. I love this movie, so im not referring to the film itself. Im talking about the transfer. There are parts of the film that shine on bluray, but the rest is suffering from compression issues. For example there are parts where the picture gets extremely pixelated and blur is rampant. Simply a bad compression problem resulting in 480i video. Ive never seen this problem before on any other bluray release, hopefully troma recalls these blurays and fixes the problem. Especially after the horrid Rabid Grannies bluray. I love Troma and will always support them, but whoever is putting these blurays together without checking for problems needs to be canned.",1430870400,2,836,4.732876712328767
937668,4,6304877501,"TOXIC AVENGER II is certainly a fun movie.  There are so many gags, references, and fun over-the-top gore effects that keep the movie flowing like toxic ooze, in a good way of course.  But my opinion of the movie isn't really what I'm here to discuss...I want to talk about the Blu Ray!  So, let's talk picture quality.  I have to say this is one of the oddest transfers I have ever seen.  Some of it looks fantastic, nice and crisp, and detailed in High Definition... but there are other parts that seem almost pixelly, like a not-so-great DVD transfer.  These two varations of picture quality continue to intermingle with each other throughout the film. Fortunately, as the movie goes on, you just get used to it, and there is more good than bad... Very interesting transfer.  The audio seems fine, clear for the most part, and average.  Bonus features are carried over from the DVD release with the exception of a new introduction by Lloyd Kaufman.  Overall, I'd give this Blu Ray disc a 3.3 out of 5.  It's a must have for any TOXIC AVENGER fan, but has it's limitations.",1429747200,4,1075,4.552083333333333

7878979,5,6304877501,"This is really the best movie that there is, and my favorite movie no less.

Where others may see a steaming pile of hot cheese in this F-grade camp/action/comedy/superhero/sexy/gorefest, those with rudiments in the genre will see the master-craftsmanship that went in to making this movie a reality. It's the only part of the quadrilogy that I've yet seen, but I've seen it dozens of times, always in the back catalog of on demand streaming services.

I gave my wife this exact introduction last night, when I explained to her why I had just purchased the 7 DVD box set of this zenith of film making. We popped the metaphorical popcorn and sat down to watch the unrated directors cut I am now reviewing.

Right from the get go I can tell the pacing of this cut is much slower, and to good effect. It really gives you some time to get into the world of the toxic avenger and understand its rules. To fully enjoy this movie you have to selectively turn off the parts of your brain that deal with abstract, and spacial, reasoning and logic. My wife kept wanting to jump in and point out where the plot was beginning to veer course out of continuity and I begged her, ""just wait, you ain't seen nothing yet.""

Toxie's dialog in this cut, as in the theatrical, is priceless gold. Virtually ever line spoken from the leather-faced ghoul is worthy of an award, monument, or possibly even a tattoo for the courageous. I won't give away much about the extra scenes compared to the original, but I'm sure you'll be delighted to know there's more nudity and violence than ever before.

Kids these days think Deadpool was the first superhero movie to break the rules an genre bend into dark gory comedy. They should put down there pokie mans, pass the peace pipe and watch the toxic avenger. See what comedy could be when you didn't have to pander to internet memes and bathroom-stall quality dick jokes. See what a few million dollars of gore buys you before CGI. I tell you, it is beautiful. A movie like this will never be made again in the same way those classic hiphop albums could not be made today. The industry has changed too much. We went down a different path and there's no going back. There's thousands of unlicensed references to pop-culture mania from a half dozen michael jackson dance moves in the first fight scene, to an Evil Dead easter egg, insane pyrotechnics, prosthetics... it's all here folks. Heck, 50% of the movie is dedicated to boarding-exploitative Japanophilia.

Well anyway, toxic avenger represents, to me, the road not taken. An independent film maker pouring his life work, his absolute opus, into an adventure so unabashedly farcical, that I'm sure there were more than a few points in the journey he questioned his own sanity and the sanity of those who agreed to work with him. Lloyd Kaufman is the Icarus to mel brooks' Daedalus. He is an anaconda to monty's python. He deserves recognition on the galactic stage. He found beauty in the absurd, in doing so, showed us how absurd we, ourselves, are, and how beautiful that makes us.",1471564800,2,3060,4.636531365313653

There are some flashes of the low-budget good humor that that made the first one a winner, and the change of location is fun, but for the most part this is a screechy, desperate mess that wears out its welcome pretty quickly.",1468368000,,407,4.285714285714286
7878981,5,6304877501,"What I liked best about this blu ray release is that it's even longer then the version that was on the Tox Box set, and I once owned that set. The opening fight scene was longer. In this version you see Melvin fight the KKK guy, which I don't remember seeing in the Tox Box set. Plus you see a little more of his fight with Michael Jai White. That part originally started with a close-up of him twirling his nunchucks. Now he gets in a few kicks before that close-up. Plus the boardroom scene that follows the fight has a lot more in it. However, alot of that was what ended up in part three. Overall, I'm glad I got the blu ray edition. It's the best version yet.  PS, if what I heard about the blu ray for part 3 is true (R rated and not uncut), then I'll just stick with the original DVD of that one.",1468195200,,803,4.01875
