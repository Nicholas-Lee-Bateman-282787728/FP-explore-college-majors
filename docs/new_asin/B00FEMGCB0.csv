8614917,5,B00FEMGCB0,"You don't want too much to be concrete and literal in the strange indefinable world of Allemonde that Debussy and Maeterlinck evoke so enigmatically in Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande. You can't have the characters float around aimlessly like ciphers (even if Robert Wilson has successfully proved otherwise), but you need to recognise that there are passions here as deep as the wells in Allemonde that the characters keep dropping precious objects into. Nikolaus Lehnhoff is particularly successful in this 2012 Essen production Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande not only in how he connects the semi-abstract altered-states to an underpinning realism, but in how he gives due attention to Golaud, a the figure whose nature and actions arguably have a more significant impact on the tone and the direction events take than the main characters.

The establishment of a suitable environment for Allemonde is critical also, and that's central to Lehnhoff's concept. The castle where one never sees the skies, the caverns and the wells all evoke a specific atmosphere of oppressiveness and Raimund Bauer's sets bring all this together into a boxed structure that is classical and symmetrical in a way that imposes a sense of order and consistency. There's considerable attention paid however to thee subtle changes and the emotional undercurrents that are expressed in the score. I don't think I've never seen a production of Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande that adheres to and matches the moods and rhythms so well. Much of the personalities of the characters in the work however is also conveyed in the very timbre of voice and the expression and weight given to the parlando expression of the singing.

Jacques Imbrailo's Pell&eacute;as is therefore lyrical but conflicted, driven by strange urges and entranced by M&eacute;lisande's hair, passions that the world of Allemonde is unused to. As M&eacute;lisande Michaela Selinger personifies this complicated bearer of dangerous beauty, delicate and sensitive, yet confused and exasperated with her condition - the victim (or catalyst) of an unknown trauma in the past doomed to perhaps repeat it. It's Golaud however and the tormented state of his mind filled with suspicion and fearful of betrayal, who arguably asserts the most influence over events, the direct agent at least of the tragedy that ensues. He is however also the injured party, tormented and to be pitied. I've seen Vincent Le Texier sing this role before, but never so soulfully and never so sensitive to the rhythms of the music that seem to be opening up his soul every time he speaks. He's the dark heart of this Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande, the personification of the Allemonde whose sense of order and solidity is broken down by the presence of M&eacute;lisande.

There is undoubtedly an element of haunting detachment to Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande, but this production still comes across as a little bit cold. There should perhaps be a better balance between the warmth of the score and the singing and the coolness of the production, but that perhaps doesn't work as well on the screen as it might have in the theatre. A gauze screen at the front of the stage softens and diffuses the light, so the clarity you might expect to see in a High-Definition recording is reduced to indistinct softness and haziness. The musical performance under Stefan Soltesz is as beautiful as you would expect, but it doesn't have a fullness of presence in the audio mixes either.

The Blu-ray has optional subtitles in French, German, English, Spanish, Italian and Korean. These can only be selected during play through the remote or the pop-up menu. There are however fixed titles on the screen in English in the musical interludes between scenes that give a synopsis of the next scene like a strange foretelling of events. Other than a couple of trailers there are no extra features on the production, but the director provides some thoughts in the enclosed booklet, and Debussy's own description of how he came to write Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande is also included.
