I wish the guys would have taken a little better care of themselves. I mean a bit overweight.  The bass player really needs to give up the Indian gimmick
I understand that he is Native American but bro you look ridiculous in the getup.
When he was younger it was cool but now.  Not so much.
Drummer was impressive.  The crowd sucked bad.  Blackfoot has always and will continue to be one of my favorite bands.",1476662400,,532,4.227722772277228
8241567,5,B0011ETO5Q,This is a great concert but if you are a Blackfoot fan then this is a must see for you.  Great mix sound and performances.  Also well edited and some great camera work too. Don't wait if your a southern rock fan too!  Good Job Guys!!,1357257600,,233,4.021739130434782
8241568,3,B0011ETO5Q,"It's nice to see the band back on the road. It's too bad that Rickey Medlocke isn't there with them. It's not that they don't do the older songs okay, it's just that they don't do them excellently. They work the stage and most in the crowd, but it seems like most people were expecting someone to be there who never came. As far as most of the older bands that are out there working the oldies revival road, at least Blackfoot has original members in the line-up. This set would be released again the next year with a new cover so don't be fooled by the two different DVD's. The band is pretty tight on most songs the one problem being is that they don't have another quality player in the band. Charlie does a great job, but without Mr. Medlocke he doesn't have anyone in the band who can match his ferocity lick for lick. With three original members still alive isn't it time that someone extended an olive branch to Rickey so that the life long fans like myself can see the real Blackfoot rise again.",1251504000,,1003,4.3121693121693125
8241569,3,B0011ETO5Q,"Well once again we have been duped by the manufacturers. This is the same show as ""Live In Kentucky"". When I ordered it I thought I was getting another Blackfoot show. Much to my dismay, as soon as the opening interview segment started I knew I had seen this show before. I realize this version predates the ""Live in Kentucky"" DVD but still, whats up with that? Buyer beware if you already own ""Live in Kentucky"" you are just getting the same show in a different package. Its still a great show and should be enjoyed by all but again, why do the studios keep doing this to us consumers? They show time and again they really only care about one thing, yes you guessed it, the almighty dollar.",1249776000,3,691,4.364341085271318
8241570,1,B0011ETO5Q,Rickey Medlock is not on this DVD that should say it all..This is not Blackfoot. Dont bother with this one its that bad.....,1224374400,,124,4.434782608695652
8241571,5,B0011ETO5Q,"THIS BAND ROCKS!!! Like the title says ""Southern Rock's Best, this may very well be true. This concert is ""high-energy"" rock and roll, very guitar oriented (you get three guitar players), and all the band members put ""100 Percent +"" effort into the concert. The songs are great, the  band is great,and the audience is great, making this one GREAT CONCERT DVD. It was filmed recently in Kentucky.

The line-up consists of 5 members (2 of the 5 are founding members):
You get three guitar players (two of which alternate singing the vocals),
You get founding member and Native American ""Greg T. Walker"" on the bass guitar (he is dressed in his Native American outfit), and you get a drummer. These guys play with an ""attitude"" they really deliver. Rickey Medlocke has not been with the band for quiet some time. He has been with the current version of Lynyrd Skynyrd for more than 10 years.

The concert consists of 15 songs with an approximate running time of 1 hour and 18 minutes. Some highlights I liked include: ""Railroad Man"", ""Sunshine Again"" (this is dedicated to the late Jakson Spires who was the original drummer of Blackfoot and to some departed Molly Hatchet members), ""Fox Chase"" (this is introduced by a recording of Shorty Medlocke,Rickey Medlocke's granddad - it's a great introduction and great song), ""Left Turn on a Red Light"", ""Guitar Solo"", ""Train, Train"" (this is a true classic that was written by Shorty Medlocke and is very well performed here), ""Highway Song"" (This is another classic that is performed to near perfection here, they play an extended version that highlights the 3 guitars playing this song - kinda like the ""Freebird""  guitar solo's), and ""Good Morning"".

Overall, this is an excellent 100 percent pure ""Southern Rock"" concert, that is performed in an outstanding manner. I higly recommend this one.",1222819200,,1840,4.903536977491961
8241572,4,B0011ETO5Q,"I didn't know this dvd even existed, but I'm glad I found it. No, there's no Rickey Medlock, but there's still 2 original members, and the other guys are very quality players and stick true to Blackfoot music. If U like Blackfoot at all U'll like this one.",1208131200,,256,4.354166666666667
8241573,4,B0011ETO5Q,"First, let me tell you that Rickey Medlock is not on this DVD. Next, let me say that this is a good DVD.I think it is worth the money, even without Rickey. If you are a Blackfoot fan, this is a must have. The sound quality is great, as is the video. This is not an old recording.",1201737600,,279,3.8275862068965516
