2554665,5,B000F8DB9O,"Dr. Andrew Weil presents the topic of healthy aging in a beautiful garden setting that looks like a Garden of Eden. The topic of aging has almost become like a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Should you taste of the fruit of youth from medical knowledge and put yourself in opposition to nature or taste of the fruits of maturity as they present themselves in all their positive aspects.

Lifestyle changes to increase the depression of morbidity are promoted, but taking hormones is not something Dr. Weil seems to be interested in because he encourages a more natural pathway. Instead of rejecting the aging process, he embraces the wisdom and positive aspects of growing older.

How can fruit pigments help you stay younger?

What should you do to get the best night's sleep?

Should exercise be adapted for your current age?

Why should we focus on an anti-inflammatory diet?

What is an anti-inflammatory diet?

Dr. Andrew Weil's trips overseas have given him insight into how many cultures live and how they treat the aging population. He gives a list of foods you can incorporate into your diet to make you healthier and to live a long, happy life. At the end of this PBS special, there is a summary of all the things you can do to contribute to your own mental, emotional and physical health. The extras include a short biography, ideas for creating a walking labyrinth, the 4-7-8 breathing technique, more information on an ethical will and additional questions from the audience.

Dr. Andrew Weil's wisdom has helped me on all levels and his medical advice is practical and healing. When you really get down to the basics of what you need to feel better in life, Dr. Weil has the answers. His breathing exercises and tips on how to get a better night's sleep are priceless.

8118856,5,B000F8DB9O,"My Mom is like a Dr. Weil groupy at the age of 80...LOL. So I watched this just because on netflix to see why she is so in love with this man. Suprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this show. There are alot of ""experts"" out there but I believe we simply take inforamtion that we agree with, research it, then see if we can apply it to our lives. I also believe that we all need to be our own experts concerning our bodies. For instance I will not eat soy, and I have my own beliefs about meat...I won't touch it anymore. I don't agree with everything he says, but this man does know his stuff, and the delivery of the information I just love. He can take a very complicated subject and eplain it in a systematic manner that is so easy to understand. And honestly, I believe that he really cares about helping people which makes me a big fan. Like I said, I don't agree with everything he says but overall, this is definitely a guy I will listen to as I too try to gracefully age through my 5th decade of life.

8118857,5,B000F8DB9O,"There is something that has always made me wonder. Why do most people only get interested in being healthy when they are old and have health problems? This video is not only informative for older people (although a portion of the information is specifically for them) but people of all ages. Dr. Weil does a great job in this video of discussing the basics of all aspects of maintaining good heatlh and preventing health issues.
I once read a book and then found a great review on amazon which was a great summary of the book, and I'm glad to do the same for anybody who is reading this now. Although there is much more detailed information in the video which I do highly suggest you watch. Here are the main points you can expect to learn from watching.

1. Eat an anti-inflammatory diet- olive, seed, nut, and avocado oils. Avoid margarine, vegetables shortening, partially hydrogenated and polly-unsaturated oils. Seasonings like turmeric. Take Omega 3 fatty acids like Sockeye Salmon always wild, least carnivorous. Lots of vegetables, eat across color spectrum. Eat slow digesting carbohydrates not fast digesting.
2. Good multivitamin- important antioxidants like vitamin E, C, Selenium, whole family of carotenoid pigments, folic acid (800 micrograms/day) vitamin D (1000 units/day).  Multivitamin fills gaps in diet.
3. Preventative medicine- immunizations, diagnostic tests, managing conditions
4.physical activity- aerobic like walking fast and uphill, strength training for muscle mass. Flexibility like stretching, yoga, or tai chi. Change sports and exercises according to what feels good and doesn't cause pain.
5. Rest and sleep- nap 10-20 minutes during afternoon, use dim lighting one hour before bed. Sleep in complete darkness
6. Stress management-  use breathing ecercises or other stress management daily, get massages
7. Exercise your mind- always continue to learn new things
8. Stay connected socially and intellectually
9. Remain flexible in mind and body- stay adaptable to changes in life
10. There are benefits of aging- wisdom, experience
11. Don't deny aging- anti aging products and surgeries
12. Leaving a legacy- bestow wisdom to younger generations",1335225600,6,2182,5.318840579710145
