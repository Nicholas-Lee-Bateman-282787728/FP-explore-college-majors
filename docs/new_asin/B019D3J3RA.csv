7570406,5,B019D3J3RA,"This movie is amazing. An emotional roller coaster. Moe Dunford is incredible as Patrick. I laughed, I cried, I was at a loss for words, overcome with so many emotions. Terry McMahon did a fantastic job writing and directing this film. I feel like I could list every emotion there is and tell you I felt it watching this film. I was already a Moe Dunford fan - but he truly stunned me with Patrick's Day. He deserves every award imaginable for his potrayal. Brilliant film. Hands down.",1460937600,,485,4.5227272727272725
7570407,3,B019D3J3RA,"I love how this story is written, the viewer must pay attention in order to be able to follow it, and then connect the dots to understand it.  I didn't like the dark story it told.  The story is right up there with any horror film.  I didn't like being entranced (by the writing) to see the story all the way through.  I would not have watched this had I known what the story was about.  And the ending is not worth having to sit through the story.",1460246400,,448,4.045454545454546

7570410,5,B019D3J3RA,"Patricks Day is an absolute masterpiece. This evocative film is the perfect blend of brilliant writing, courageous acting, and subject material that reaches deep in a grabs the heart, incites the mind and ignites the soul.
I had the privilege of seeing this film in theater and have since purchased the DVD for myself as well as extra copies to gift to friends and colleagues.
For film lovers, this is a must see and must own. For people  spanning ages, genders, cultures, simply across humanity, Patricks Day is relevant to compassion, understanding, and an inside experiential view of both mental health and love.
Terry McMahon is a master filmmaker. His unique brand of presenting, the often uncomfortable realities of the most basic aspects of life (parenting, love, power, and more), with brazen compassion, and fiercely unrelenting truth, is what makes every film of his mandatory viewing.
Patricks Day will leave its mark; you will never see love, life, or cinema the same ever again.",1457395200,7,991,5.0426829268292686
7570411,5,B019D3J3RA,"This is A SPECTACULAR FILM!!

Incredibly talented Cast, Beautiful Cinematography and a Powerful story-  all Created and Directed by THE most Brilliantly Gifted Director l have ever seen!

If Hollywood had half the talent that Terry has people would live in theaters!

See this film- it's edgy, but it's one of the rare films that will leave you spellbound and talking about it for days!",1457395200,3,386,4.892307692307693
7570412,5,B019D3J3RA,"I'd been wanting to see Patrick's Day from the moment I read about it. I have vivid memories of how affected I'd been by Terry McMahon's previous film, Charlie Casanova. I've followed the progress of Patrick's Day on social media, and was frustrated at the time it took to be shown in England. Thanks to the Tricycle for supporting its first London screening, I had the privilege to see Patricks Day in my home town last weekend. What an extraordinary film it is! One measure of a film for me is how many times during the screening that I 'leave' the film and think for myself. I was captured from the first frame as Patrick, in his own world, wheels a supermarket trolley around the store. From that moment I was completely drawn into Patrick's (Moe Dunford) world. Moe was utterly compelling as Patrick, as was Kerry Fox, who played his mother. Terry always takes on challenging subjects, and a film about a schizophrenic is as challenging as it comes. I came away from the cinema quite shaken, and moved by my experience. I'm not a film critic, but I know what I like. I'm also not a cinematographer, but I know sublime visual storytelling when I see it, and I know sublime visual moments when they are offered, like a gift. If you want to be challenged, and asked questions; if you want to be drawn into both anger and sadness, and then dumped back into a seat in a cinema, alone but surrounded by people who have just undergone the same emotional ride as you, then see this film! Haters will always hate, but if you have a gramme of decency and compassion you will be moved to a new understanding by Patrick's Day. If you don't then I recommend Jeremy Kyle.",1457395200,6,1662,4.470394736842105

8744794,5,B019D3J3RA,"Michael Lavelle's beautiful intimate cinematography brings us inside the world of these complex characters, especially in scenes without dialogue. Surprising raw performances from the entire cast, these characters feel real, finding humor in darkest of places. Always love Kerry Fox.",1485129600,,283,6.1
8744795,5,B019D3J3RA,This movie is one that I would liken to the experience of one who flew over the kookoo's nest. Great film!,1482192000,,106,4.095238095238095
8744796,5,B019D3J3RA,"This film was difficult to watch because of the issues surrounding the main characters. Mental illness, loneliness, isolation, love,happiness, pain, sorrow and hope. It felt too close to home and was quite intense at times. This film draws you in and causes you to get involved and caught up in the characters circumstances and turmoils. I loved this film because it shows nothing in life is simple or just black or white. The ending leaves you wondering about the outcome of the main characters. It could have been more than what it was,but, that may have been the intention of the director. I'm not sure, that is why, I highly recommend, to rent this film and watch it. Definitely not a waste of film or your time. I loved this film so much, I purchased it.",1475280000,,759,4.588235294117647
