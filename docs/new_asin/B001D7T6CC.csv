3526741,5,B001D7T6CC,"Honestly, I hate doing movie ""reviews"" because they are so subjective.  I just really love Starman and this was the cheapest way to get it.  It is a great movie that is hard to define in any one type...its an alien/sort of love story.  I also love Karen Allen and her freckles.  It has some adult themes in it but I would feel ok with my 10 year old or older watching it.  Jagged Edge has another of my favs..Glenn Close... it is a predictable, but still engaging murder thriller.  Just my opinion... so easy with the hate buttons. :)",1402617600,3,534,4.29
3526742,4,B001D7T6CC,Starman is probably John Carpenter's most unjustly neglected work as it doesn't fit easily into his horror portfolio. But it is well written and finely acted particularly by the wonderful Karen Allen. Jagged Edge is not in the same class given that it is based on the typical Joe Esterhaz plot trick - seen one seen em all - but Bridges is fine in a dangerous role.,1398470400,2,365,4.462686567164179
