1045192,5,6305462224,"This volume of the ""Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy"" series starts off with ""Liberty"", which, while going into Harold Lloyd territory slightly, is an utter masterpiece. Some of the stunts performed on the construction site still inspire gasps after the fourth or fifth viewing.
The second and last of the genuine Laurel and Hardy shorts on this volume is ""We Faw Down,"" which is a delightful little comedy which, like many other Laurel and Hardy films, involves the boys trying to hide their latest fling from their wives.
Other shorts presented here are either solo-efforts (""Bromo and Juliet,"" ""Along Came Auntie"") or very early pairings, such as the hilarious ""Love 'Em and Weep"" and ""The Lucky Dog"" (which is their first film together).
The DVD looks very good, especially in ""Liberty"" and ""We Faw Down,"" which are clearer than you'd expect. The others can be scratchy at times but are all very sharp. The shorts have been digitally mastered from original 35mm material, or in some cases from the original nitrate camera negatives. Like most silent films released through Image Entertainment, this is quite satisfactory.
There are no special features, other than some liner notes.",1047081600,9,1183,5.040816326530612
1045193,5,6305462224,"Volume 3 in this series continues to present silent shorts from the early days of Laurel & Hardy.  The first two on this DVD have the distinction of being two of the three Laurel & Hardy comedies directed by the great Leo McCarey.  ""Liberty"" (1929) is an absolute classic.  The boys escape from prison whereupon they are picked up by friends in a car and change into civilian clothes.  The simple premise for this classic comedy is that Stan and Ollie have on each other's pants, and they spend the rest of the time trying to change clothes, ending up on the high girders of a skyscraper.  Obviously this is a very large tip of the hat to the work of Harold Lloyd, although the gags are all perfect for Laurel & Hardy.  It is also a very risque film for its day, with the boys always being discovered lowering their pants in strange places.  In ""We Faw Down"" the boys announce to their wives they are going to a show when they are really heading out for a poker game.  When they hear the theater burned down, the wives are understandably distraught.  But Stan & Ollie, having fallen into a mud puddle, have been taken by two pretty young flirts to the girl's apartment.  Of course, as the boys are leaving the apartment without their trousers, their wives show up with shotguns.  The film's climax is the best gag in ""We Faw Down"" and one of the funniest endings to a Laurel & Hardy two-reeler.
This DVD collection also invludes the very first on-screen pairing of Laurel & Hardy in 1919's ""The Lucky Dog,"" although they are certainly not a team at this point.  ""Love 'Em and Weep"" from 1927 is another one of the Hal Roach-Pathe comedies featuring James Finlayson in which Stan Laurel is the second comic lead and Oliver Hardy has a more minor role.  All three are henpecked husbands whose lives are complicated by the return of Finlayson's old flame, Mae Busch.  This particular story line is used by the boys to much better effect in their talkie ""Chickens Come Home,"" so track it down after watching this silent version.  This time around the bonus shorts reveal Oliver Hardy teamed up with other comics in a pair of 1926 two-reelers: ""Along Came Auntie"" with Glenn Tryon and ""Bromo and Juliet"" with Charley Chase.  These are more interesting than the Stan Laurel shorts on the first two volumes because they provide cinematic proof that the boys were perfectly matched comedic partners.",989625600,13,2391,4.590588235294118
1045194,5,6305462224,"This is another superb installment in this Laurel and Hardy DVD collection. The DVD begins with one of Laurel and Hardy's finest silent films, ""Liberty"". This short finds the boys in ""high and  dizzy"" situations that were more accustomed to Harold Lloyd, but they  pull it off with hilarious results. ""We Faw Down"" is the second  short and it too is another classic. The basic storyline was later used in  Laurel and Hardy films such as ""Be Big!"", ""Sons of the  Desert"", and ""Block-heads"".  This DVD also gives us a  look at another performer at the Hal Roach Studios, Charley Chase in  ""Bromo and Juliet"". The film picture quality in this short is not  up to the high standards set by the first two shorts, it seems  scratched  and faded at times, but the comic material is equally hilarious. The rare  short ""The Lucky Dog"" is also included and we are able to see the  first screen appearance of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy together even  though they are not a team at this time.  ""Along Came  Auntie"" is a slaptstick/farce comedy that features Oliver Hardy,  Vivian Oakland, Glen Tryon, and Lucy Beamont. It is a very entertaining  short, but the first reel has a ""worn looking"" picture quality  due to the fact that the first reel of the original nitrate print has  already decomposed and lesser quality material had to be inserted, but the  second reel is still around and looks great. We are very lucky that the  film was found before it could be further damaged by nitrate decomposition.  The final short, ""Love 'Em and Weep"" is one of my favorites  from this DVD. It is the original silent version of Laurel and Hardy's  ""Chicken's Come Home (1931)"", but this version has Jimmie  Finlayson playing the part Ollie did in ""Chickens Come Home"" and  Ollie plays the judge invited to Tillsbury's (Finlayson's) house The  picture quality is excellant and the film is must see for any fan of Laurel  and Hardy, especially fans of ""Chickens Come Home""  Just for  a side note, you might have noticed Vivian Oakland, the talented actress  who appears in three films on this DVD. She is Stan's wife in ""Love  'Em and Weep"", Ollie's wife in ""We Faw Down"" and the leading  lady in ""Along Came Auntie"" She would also appear several years  later in Laurel and Hardy's film ""Scram."" Fans of Our Gang (The  Little Rascals) will also recognize Mae Wallce (Ollie's wife in Love 'Em  and Weep) from her part as Jackie, Mary Ann and Wheezer's mother in the  short ""Love Business"" a few years later. This is a great DVD and  it contains some great films and I would highly recommend it.",961372800,7,2573,4.6084070796460175
1045195,5,6305462224,I have been looking for the movie Shoe Shine Girl for about 12 years now and i can't find it anywhere. I used to watch it all the time when i was a little girl but i don't really remember the main characters names. I heard  somewhere along the line that it is a Laurel and Hardy flic.

7891202,5,6305462224,"It's Laurel & Hardy, what more can you say?  Naturally when they are together it is much funnier, but it is very interesting to see their early work indepent of each other.  I didn't like the music that was dubbed over the films.  Even though LeRoy Shield didn't write the background music until years later, that music could have been dubbed in.  In my opinion it would have vastly improved the sketches.  You can see the same thing in the later ""talkies"" after Roach Studios stopped using Shield's music.",1386806400,,506,4.640449438202247
7891203,3,6305462224,"I have purchased Vol. 3 and now have the whole Lost Films set. I live in the UK and have also obtained the 21 disc collection released by Universal. I have compared the silents of both sets back to back and I have to say that 'The Lost Films' set has many good points but the negatives out-weigh the positives.

The Silent films presented on the Universal set for the most part have been digitally cleaned, restored, mastered and scored with music from the band Beau Hunks who do a fantastic job of re-creating/scoring the soundtracks from the L&H talkies.

The problem with the 'Lost Films' set is that it has constant niggling problems throughout which, if were left out would make this set better than the Universal set.

Negatives:

Freeze Frames; Constantly the films picture freezes for a second either just before a change of scene/shot or before the title card is about to appear, an example of this is in the film Liberty, which is presented in this volume. Frozen pictures are used to fill in where there is perhaps missing footage, if the footage is lost, then it would be better not to use it at all rather than use freeze frames of existing footage, e.g The Second Hundred Years. Also there are a few scenes in certain films where the same bit of footage is repeated e.g Their Purple Moment.

Music; There are several shorts in this collection that uses the original Vitaphone Record scores that were made to be played along with the film. That is all very good and a great bonus, but what is incredibly annoying is when the films that don't have their existing Vitaphone Record sountracks use elements from the various Vitaphone sountracks and mish-mash them together, this particularly irritating when sound affects of car honks, horse nays and piana keys bashing is played over the top of a film that doesn't even require the sound effect. Also a lot of the music is not in sync, particuarly Wrong Again and Liberty.

Print Quality; A lot of the prints in 'The Lost Films' set are the same as the Universal collection but some of the materials used in the Lost Films are from better 35mm/16mm prints. This is the case for From Soup To Nuts and Wrong Again and Angora Love which has elements of better footage over the Universal set. The annoying thing is that the footage changes constanlty from excellent quality to very good quality to poor quality. This wouldn't be so noticable if the changes weren't so frequent and random, particularly with Angora Love. One minute you are viewing a very nice 35mm print then right in the middle of the same scene it cuts to a lesser 16mm print. The switch should occur on a change of scene and not in the middle of it. I'd rather watch a very good print all the way through than an excellent print that randomly changes to inferior quality all the way through. Also a hurrendous error by the producers of these films is the terrible grey square in the right hand corner of the films Flying Elephants and Habeas Corpus, it is distracting, ugly and unnesessary. Although the print of Flying Elephants overall is better than the Universal version, I keep watching the Universal one because unlike the Lost Films version it doesn't distract me from what I am watching. Another nagging factor is the constant change of film speed, some scenes are slowed down in order for us the viewer to catch the short flash of footage, this, like the constant changing of picture quality is distracting and doesn't need to be done.

Video Transfers; I think these prints are overall gorgeous, if not a little too greyscale. What ruins them and makes them less superior over the Universal set is that they in fact haven't been digitally remastered for DVD release at all. The versions presented on DVD are from the VHS/Laserdisc masters. If they hade been digitally cleaned, upscaled and restored I would think that they would look better than the Universal prints, but unfortunetely they haven't been so although they are excellent prints they are just not as good as they could have looked. Another case in point is the constant video lines that appear throughout the films, e.g 45 Minutes From Hollywood, Putting Pants on Philip and Leave Em laughing and many more. This is amateur-ish and should never be present on DVD masters, the Universal set certainly doesn't suffer from this.

Positives:

Frame; These films are not cropped as much as the Universal set so with these prints you do see more of the picture which is a great plus.

Footage: Other than Putting Pants On Philip and Love Em & Weep a lot of the Lost Films shorts contain missing footage and intertitles that are not included on the Universal set but are present on the Lost Films DVDs.

Intertitles: Although freeze frames are annoying I don't mind freeze frames of intertitles it's nice that they are presented, but I do very much like the re-created titles on the Universal set.

So overall I think the Universal set wins by some margin, the saddest part is, if a little more care and attention was paid to these prints the Lost Films collection would have been better than any previous release of Laurel & Hardy's silent films. Maybe next time.",1307923200,2,5155,4.671444321940463
7891204,1,6305462224,"To the point:  for much better quality, buy the U.K. version.  Not only is the picture clearer, but the synchronization between picture and sound is maintained to end of Liberty.  Yes, you'll have to buy an inexpensive Region 2 DVD player, or use your computer, but sooner or later you'll have to do this anyway if you want to see your favorite films before you die.  In this LOST series version of ""Libery"", for some reason the title ""I wasn't nipping!"" was re-filmed 3 times for a grand total of 17 seconds, putting the sound way, way ahead of the picture for the rest of the movie.  How could the distributors not notice this?  I always wonder how people stay in business these days with incompetence so rampant, and no one ever double-checks their work...

For historians, this is an interesting collection to watch once, mostly because it contains the first film L&H were in together.",1177113600,6,889,4.660256410256411
7891205,3,6305462224,"I adore Laurel and Hardy comedies, both silent and sound shorts.  But Volume 3 of THE LOST FILMS OF LAUREL ANDHARDY from Hal Roach Studios is a major disappointment.  The prints are gorgeous studio prints with lively Jazz Age music scores.  But too few of the six silent shorts are true Laurel and Hardy comedies.

LIBERTY (1929) is up first and a true Laurel and Hardy classic.  They are escaped convicts who end up with each others' pants on and fish inside on top of an under construction building site in Culver City.  Leo McCarey directed and George Stevens photographed this comedy gem.

The other five shorts are a mixed bag.  WE FAW DOWN (1928) has a variation on the SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) plot, where the boys tell their wives they are meeting with The Boss at a theater, then getting hilariously involved with two women in a plot too convoluted to describe here.  Suffice to say, the theater burns down and Laurel and Hardy have wet clothes in the apartment of the two beautiful women.  The wives find that out and wait for the boys to confess.  It is good fun.

BROMO AND JULIET (1926) has Oliver Hardy as a chauffeur in one of Charley Chase's funniest comedies, a parody of ROMEO AND JULIET with seemingly everyone drunk except the leading lady.  Of course, it has a happy ending and is a very good introduction to Chase's comedy persona.

THE LUCKY DOG (1919), the first real Laurel and Hardy movie, has Laurel starring and Hardy in a small role as a crook.  Shown for decades in only a heavily cut version, we owe this complete 24 minute print to the late William K. Everson.  It is a rare and fascinating curio, not bad.

ALONG CAME AUNTIE (1926) stars someone named Glenn Tryon, along with Oliver Hardy without Laurel.  Tryon is the current husband and Hardy the first husband of a woman who will inherit a fortune from a rich aunt if she can prove she has never been divorced.  So Tryon has to masquerade as a roomer and not a husband.  Again, not a real L & H comedy at all, but with hilarious slapstick moments.

The film that gives me the most trouble here is LOVE `EM AND WEEP (1927).  If you did not know this was a Laurel and Hardy comedy, you would swear it was a full-fledged film noir--happily married Jimmy Finlayson  is being blackmailed by nasty Mae Busch, with whom he had a fling in his younger days.  Busch wants money, or she will tell the wife everything.  Laurel plays Finlayson's secretary, and Hardy has a small role.  Laurel and Hardy remade this as a sound short called CHICKENS COME  HOME a few years later, with Hardy in Finlayson's role and Busch repeating her villainous role.  I did not laugh very much and would love to see LOVE `EM AND WEEP in a theater with an audience to see if they laugh at it.

Again, the print quality is magnificent in this whole LOST FILMS OF LAUREL AND HARDY series, and the music scores are nostalgic.  Volume Three is wildly uneven, but sometimes great.  Don't start your collection with this one, unless it sounds wonderful to you from my review.  There are better volumes.",1176508800,4,3052,4.482758620689655
7891206,3,6305462224,"We all experience many important ""firsts"" in our lives that stay with us. First love, first kiss, first Christmas..ect. Well one of the things I remember was the first thing I saw that made me laugh. It was Laurel and Hardy. It wasn't one of the shorts presented here but their movie ""Way Out West"". From a young child I've always been a fan of their comedy. Knowing this recently I was given several of these DVD collections featuring Laurel and Hardy's silent works, and even solo pieces. I will review each short individually.

 LIBERTY (1929, 20 Mins.) - The ""boys"" were known for their ""mixed-up"" derby gag, well here they play a variation of it, the ""mixed-up"" pants gag. While escaping jail the two mix up their pants in a get-a-way car. Only afterwards do they realize what they have done that they seek a place to change pants. This leads the two to find themselves high above a construction site where they are several stories high. In a way the piece is like ""Puttin' Pants On Phillip"", a short the team made in 1927. But many claim it resembles a Harold Lloyd short. Back in the 1920's daredevil or ""thrill"" comedies were quite popular and Lloyd, along with Buster Keaton, were known for these comedies. In fact Lloyd did appear in a short where he too was atop a construction site, ""Never Weaken (1921)"". While the daredevil comedy is not really Laurel and Hardy's strong suit the ""boys"" turn this into one of their best silent comedies. I'd say one of the top three. *** 1/2 (out of *****)

 WE FAW DOWN (1928,21 MINS.) - ""We Faw Down"" has the boys lying to their wives in order to go out to a poker game. They tell the wives they are going to meet THE BOSS at a theater. Well as things turn out that very theater burns down but the wives see the ""boys"" with two women whom they innocently helped out when one of the ladies lost their hat.
 The theme was later reused in the 1933 film the team made ""Sons of the Desert"" and the ending was also reused in ""Block-Heads (1938)"". In fact what Laurel and Hardy did, along with other silent comedians, was simply repeat all of their material for sound, not that there's anything wrong with that. Here is a good idea that simply doesn't seem developed enough, maybe it just needed to be seen in a longer format, but it does have some laughs. *** (out of *****)

 BROMO AND JULIET (1926,24 MINS) - On these ""Lost"" DVD'S not all of the shorts star Laurel and Hardy as a team, this is one of them. These DVD'S sometimes have Charley Chase shorts which Oliver Hardy acted in. I'm glad that we can see some of Chase's shorts, but keep in mind not all of them are good. Though there is a good one on volume 5 of the series. This one can get kind of boring and doesn't really show Chase at his best.  ** (out of *****)

 THE LUCKY DOG (1917,24 MINS) - The DVD says this was made 1919, IMDB says 1917, I'm going with IMDB, you can chose which one you like.

 ""The Lucky Dog"" has Laurel and Hardy appearing together in a short for the first time, though they are NOT a team. They are rivals. In seems this piece has never been available in its ""complete"" form until now, aren't we ""lucky""? Actually though the short is funny. It moves along briskly, at times I was a little confused as to what exactly was going on, but I went along with it and had some mild fun. Plus fans of the team I'm sure will be curious to see this if only for ""historical"" purposes. *** (out of *****)

 ALONG CAME AUNTIE (1926, 24 MINS) - Harold Lloyd once said that between Stan and Oliver, Stan would have made it as a single. Having seen more shorts with only Stan I think he may have been right. ""Auntie"" shows how Oliver didn't really have a fully developed persona until Laurel came along. Stan could carry a short by himself I think, but Oliver couldn't. ""Auntie"" is pretty funny at times, and has a really good situation, sometimes though the slapstick comedy gets in the way, too much beating each other up. But I laughed enough to recommend it. A little crude but funny. *** (out of *****)

 LOVE 'EM AND WEEP (1927, 24 MINS) - Like ""Auntie"" this is a fast-paced comedy that doesn't waste any time getting into things. It was remade in 1931 as ""Chickens Come Home"". If you've seen that one, James Finlayson plays the Oliver part with Stan playing the same role in both. Oliver has a brief role as a guest at the party. This is actually pretty funny, but I think dialogue was needed. Between the two I think most people will agree ""Chickens"" is better. Also worth mentioning is Mae Busch plays the same part in both versions.  *** (out of *****)

 So there you have it. A pretty solid collection of early Laurel and Hardy shorts and solo pieces. Some of the stuff on here is really funny, and the Chase short kind of disappoints. In the end though this is worth seeing, especially if you're a fan. This DVD'S were really designed for us, the devoted fans of the greatest comedy team of all-time. It is very interesting to see how the team grew and chemistry was put in place the more they worked together.

 Bottom-line: Mostly good collection of early Laurel and Hardy shorts. These are really essentials for the devoted fans, others I'm afraid may not be interested enough to watch all of them. ""Liberty"" is the best in the set.",1136246400,,5263,4.371926229508197
7891207,5,6305462224,"I will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all.

This is a stunning collection of the early work of the `boys` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives. Several of the titles in the series, have until fairly recently, been considered lost forever.

Each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc (again recently discovered) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack.

Even for those who don`t normally view `silent` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen.

Each disc deserves five stars for content, quality and value.

An update now 11.2009 - I note these discs are withdrawn and for those that purchased them or can get their hands on them now must be very satisfied.  I have had some dealinsg with Hal Roach Studios and the film restoration experts at Lobster Films in France.  It takes countless hours of work to prepare outstanding series like these using vintage 35mm material.  The results are outstanding and whilst I also have the UK versions these are the most superior. My test is always when it comes to projecting them where they belong on the big screen where these just sparkle.",1110931200,4,1480,4.845238095238095
7891208,5,6305462224,"The shorts presented herein are very fine and funny material, even the shorts that aren't real L&H shorts per se because they either appeared together but hadn't been teamed yet or because only one of them were appearing.  The strongest material of course comes from the two proper L&H shorts, 'Liberty' and 'We Faw Down'; I also very much like 'The Lucky Dog,' the film in which they first appeared together, even though they were nowhere near getting teamed yet.  'Love 'Em and Leave 'Em' is the original silent version of what later became 'Chickens Come Home'; but for the difference of roles (Ollie and not Jimmy Finlayson plays the blackmailed husband running for mayor in the sound version), it's such a practically word-by-word and gag-by-gag retelling it's uncanny.  'Bromo and Juliet,' the Charley Chase short in which Ollie appears as a police officer, is very funny and enjoyable too; it's a criminal shame that today this great funnyman and performer is all but forgotten.  'Along Came Auntie,' which was rescued from near-decomposition, is also enjoyable, but overall I'd peg it as the weakest of the six shorts presented here.  Of course the material on the discs in this collection are fantastic, but it just seems like they were assembled without rhyme or reason, like by theme or chronological order.

There are however a few minor flaws; it appears that this DVD is like the others in this collection in that it just starts playing right away, or at least it does so on my computer's DVD player.  You have to click the Menu button on the control bar to be brought to the main menu to select the short you want to see yourself, and if you're only interested in seeing one, four, and six, say, you have to repeat this every time instead of having it automatically start and the beginning and not display the menu by itself until the final short is over.  The background music, even if some of it may have been the original backing soundtrack in theatres, can also become repetitive and monotonous.  Sure it's not EXACTLY the same throughout every short, but it's not very varied either.",1108425600,3,2103,4.7554945054945055
7891209,5,6305462224,"First of all, why title this review,WHEN WILL WARNER HOME VIDEO FOLLOW SUIT? - - well as most people know Warner Bros. bought up TURNER a few years ago and thus inherited all the old MGM films, including Laurel and Hardy's sound shorts and features.
I would think the great quality of the IMAGE releases and incredibly strong reception from us home viewers should be inspiration enough to start releasing some other Laurel and Hardy treasures.
As far as this DVD is concerned, it is great as are the rest in the series. I highly recommend them to all Laurel and Hardy fans.",1050105600,7,573,4.572815533980583
7891210,4,6305462224,"I think calling this DVD ""Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" is somewhat misleading, because only 3 out of the 6 shorts feature the boys as the pair that most fans are familiar with.
""Bromo and Juliet,"" for example, has Oliver Hardy, buried under a thick mustache, in a small role as a dinner guest of Jimmy Finlayson, and Stan Laurel as one of Jimmy's employees; the two never meet in the film. In another short, Hardy shows up for a few minutes as a taxi driver.
In addition, the picture quality is not always good, but that's to be expected in films so old. And as another reviewer mentioned, the same soundtrack is used over and over, which can get a little monotonous after awhile.
Depsite the fact that this DVD wasn't exactly what I expected, however, I still enjoyed it. It was interesting to see Laurel & Hardy in roles other than ""the boys"" and the rest of the casts (Charley Chase, Mae Busch, Vivian Oakland, to name a few) gave hilarious performances. I recommend it to fans of Laurel & Hardy (and other silent stars as well), but be aware that not all the films may be what you might have expected.",1047168000,7,1106,4.4
