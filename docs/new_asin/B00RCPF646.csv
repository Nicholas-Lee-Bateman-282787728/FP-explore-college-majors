I have to confess Ive never been much of a Trekkie, however Ive always respected the shows significance in the science fiction genre.  It was truly ahead of its time, and it dutifully paved the way for many prominent franchises.  With that being said, I do enjoy watching some of The Original Series (TOS) and The Next Generation (TNG) episodes.  This was the primary component that prompted me to give STAR TREK: CAPTAIN KIRKS BOLDEST MISSIONS a look.  Im happy to report this collection contains some of my favorite TOS episodes, and I would bet this will be a must-have for any and every Star Trek fan out there.

At one point during my college career, way back in the early 90s, my English Comp instructor gave an assignment to write a lengthy compare and contrast essay.  For some reason (and I cannot for the life of me figure out why to this day), I chose to compare and contrast Captain Kirk from TOS and Captain Picard from TNG.  I made a wise choice, because my instructor told me in his grading notes that he was a huge Trekkie.  Now, every time I watch a Star Trek episode, I am reminded of his comments.

Each episode in STAR TREK: CAPTAIN KIRKS BOLDEST MISSIONS is a carefully crafted journey into the unknown.  I would even go so far as to state these are some of the best episodes of the series.  From what Ive read and heard, several of these are considered fan-favorites.

My favorite episode from this collection probably has to be The City on the Edge of Forever.  In fact, its probably my favorite episode of the whole series, although I cant actually say Ive seen every episode within it.  The City on the Edge of Forever is considered to be one of Star Treks most influential shows, and it is a masterful piece of storytelling.

STAR TREK: CAPTAIN KIRKS BOLDEST MISSIONS is a big win for me, and fans of the show will want to snatch this up immediately.  It epitomizes everything William Shatners famous character is infamous for.  The collection is available now.",1426723200,2,2057,4.513513513513513

8694849,4,B00RCPF646,"William Shatners most iconic role as the Commander of the Starship Enterprise needs no introduction to anyone who has embraced the wide worlds of science fiction cinema, television, and literature. In case you somehow jumped on the bandwagon blindly with the release of the 2009 reboot starring Chris Pine as our skipper to new galaxies, CBS Studios wants to rectify that situation. Star Trek: The Original Series  Captain Kirks Boldest Missions looks to educate new viewers and recap old ones through highlights of the Federations most celebrated Starfleet officer.

Star Trek: The Original Series  Captain Kirks Boldest Missions is a collection of eight episodes celebrating the character William Shatner made a household name of when the television show premiered in 1966. They include important adventures like The Carbomite Maneuver, ""The Conscience of the King,"" ""Balance of Terror,"" ""Space Seed,"" ""The City on the Edge of Forever,"" ""Mirror, Mirror,"" ""The Doomsday Machine,"" and ""Return to Tomorrow."" We get to experience Kirk becoming a Romulan, meeting Khan for the first time, wooing Joan Collins, and turning evil all captured on the same DVD.

I can personally guarantee top-notch entertainment as Im sure all the Kirk clichs you can think of will be touched upon. His shirt will be torn somehow, revealing his chest or abdomen. Several Kirk Rolls will be witnessed. So many personal expressions of pain, agony, sorrow, happiness, and anger will be reflected on the face of the extremely emotive William Shatner as he goes through just another ordinary day of intergalactic exploration.

A bonus that comes with Star Trek: The Original Series  Captain Kirks Boldest Missions is the appearance of the late Leonard Nimoy in every one of the episodes. He serves his Commander with all the loyalty the pointy-eared Science Officer can logically muster. With his recent death still fresh on every fans mind, you can never get too much Mr. Spock.

Star Trek: The Original Series  Captain Kirks Boldest Missions reminds all of us what sort of take-charge man our leader can be. Hes as vulnerable as the next guy, but overcomes it with a healthy dose of passionate brashness and bravery weve all come to know and love. If you have all three seasons of the classic sci-fi show, youll probably question why you would want to buy a DVD full of miscellaneous episodes you already own. Its quite simple. You might find yourself in need of a quick Shatner fix and a collection of his finest moments all in one place will definitely come in handy at that time.",1429488000,5,2556,5.011792452830188
8694850,3,B00RCPF646,"Star Trek: The Original Series - Captain Kirk's Boldest Missions or ""How can we get Trekkers to keep buying the same episodes over and over again?"". There's nothing new to see here. If you already own the TOS season sets you're good. If not, or if you're just a glutton for re-buying the same stuff then this is for you. This is just a cash grab by Paramount.",1427068800,,359,4.294117647058823
