4701002,5,B005HIBWCU,"I thought this movie was wonderful. Barbara plays a woman who has a indian child & she is free but shuned by the whites because of what happen to her but a soldier tries to help her get a new life. Barbara is wonderful in this movie. She not only is trying to save her own life but the life of her child. Barbara always plays a strong bad woman or a strong good woman. In this movie she is a strong good woman.

She should have turned on the town for not trying to help her & get her back. they were the one who were wrong. She was kidnapped.

There always seem to be one person who votes against everyone.",1337904000,,606,3.959016393442623
4701003,5,B005HIBWCU,"Two of my favorite stars together again.  With Royal Dano and Earl Holliman to boot.  A western....indians, crooks, young love, a husband who won't forgive what happened to his wife...it's got it all...and you'll get it all if you watch this film.",1335139200,,247,4.857142857142857
4701004,5,B005HIBWCU,"Trooper Hook has a well crafted and believable plot with McCrea's character development allowed to be fleshed out. Although not a big fan of Barbara Stanwyck, her performance certainly adds to ""Trooper Hook"" with the role given. Picture and sound quality is good. As a vehicle for Joel McCrae ""Trooper Hook"" ranks alongside ""Fort Massacre"", as they both warrant more than one viewing.",1328227200,10,384,5.111111111111111
4701005,5,B005HIBWCU,"Joel McCrea was a natural as a Western actor. Despite his great successes in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, and in several other dramas of the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was the Western genre that he really loved. And he made some extremely fine ones, capping his long career and partnering with Randolph Scott in Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (1962), arguably one of the finest Westerns ever made. TROOPER HOOK is a slightly lesser effort from the late 1950s, but still a well-acted vehicle for McCrea and co-star Barbara Stanwyck.  Stanwyck is a white woman, captured and ""married to"" an Apache chief, and more, she has a son by him. McCrea is charged with rescuing her and returning her ""home."" And therein lies the source of a series of mishaps, battles with her Apache ""husband,"" and other complications. Edward Arnold and Earl Holliman add to the fine cast and resulting action.

Now that MGM/UA have released several McCrea vehicles, it is time that Universal lets us have good prints of McCrea's fine early-1950s Westerns---the very enjoyable CATTLE DRIVE, the whimsical SADDLE TRAMP (with John McIntyre, Jeannette Nolan, and Russell Simpson), BLACK HORSE CANYON (the most gentle of McCrea's oaters), FRENCHIE (McCrea's take on the ""Destry"" story) and LONE HAND. Why not issue them in a set, just as Warner has done with some of the 1950s Scott Westerns?

Joel McCrea was a genuine cowboy and a true gentleman. He is one of the most underrated actors ever to work in Hollywood films. His films deserve attention and will repay re-viewing.",1327190400,25,1570,4.961977186311787
4701006,5,B005HIBWCU,"This movie was first released in 1957(2011) in B/W, fullscreen and runs 83 minutes. The sound and picture quality are good and there are no extras. The film starts with Apache messacre of some US Army soldiers on top of a rocky hill. Soon the US Army attack the Apache, lead by Sergeant Clovert Hook(JOEL McCREA). The army burn the village and round up the Indians. Chief Nanchez(RUDOLFO ACOSTA) is captured alive. Amongst the prisoners, they find a white woman, Cora Sutliffe(BARBARA STANWYCK) with her son Keto, whose father is Nanchez. They all head back to the Fort. When questioned by the Colonel, they find that Cora had been attacked by the Cherokawa Indians and her husband was missing. Nanchez was to be sent to Saint Carlos Reservation. Fred Sutliffe(EDWARD ANDREWS)is traced running a ranch near Tuscan. Orders are given to Trooper Hook to take Cora and Keto to that ranch. After receiving hostility at the first town, Trooper Hook takes a stagecoach for Cora and Keto. At the next town they get the same hostility. Then Cowboy Jeff Benam(EARL HOLLIMAN) joins the stagecoach at Wilson's Hotel. Hook and Cora also get talking about themselves and their past. As they pass some hills, Nanchez, with broken chains, watches the stagecoach from the top of the hills. Trooper Hook also sees distant dust cloud on the left side of the stagecoach. At the next stage post, a telegram comes saying that some of the braves had broken out Nanchez from the Fort 2 days ago. Hearing this Jeff takes a horse and warns Trooper Hook about Nanchez's escape.
This excellent story of JACK SCHAFFER is beautifully photographed in B/W by ELLSWORTH FREDERICKS and briskly directed by CHARLES MARQUIS WARREN. There is also a good background song on 'Trooper Hook' sung by TEX RITTER. The action scenes are very good and Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck give masterly performances.

4701025,5,B005HIBWCU,Fine late-50's Western starring Joel McCrae and Barbara Stanwyck.  She plays a woman held captive for several years by hostile Indians and now has a child by the chief of the tribe.  Rescued by the cavalry she faces a lot of tough decisions.  She wants to keep her son who is about five or six years and is receiving pressure to turn him over to the tribe.  She refuses and is now going back to her white husband.  Meanwhile the chief has escaped captivity and is now in hot pursuit for his son.  Trooper Hook is the understanding soldier escorting her and protecting her and her son.  The Warner Brothers Limited Edition is fine quality and worth getting.  Highly recommended.,1405296000,2,677,4.583333333333333
4701026,5,B005HIBWCU,"I believe that Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea and John Wayne are three of the best western stars...and if you like Joel McCrea westerns, you will enjoy this movie.  The movie is somewhat similar to the movie, Stalking Moon, with Gregory Peck...great actors, action, and again, a good story line.  Highly entertaining movie and well worth the price.",1399680000,,345,5.035087719298246

4701030,5,B005HIBWCU,"This is an old movie, but with Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea as the stars, it is definitely worth watching.  Ms. Stanwyck was abducted by an Indian tribe, and is the mother of the Chief's son.  The army rescues her, and it is McCrea's job to escort her and her son back to her real husband.  This is complicated by the prejudices of the day, and the Chief who is coming for them.  If you are a fan of westerns, this is a good one.",1383350400,,433,4.0588235294117645

4701032,4,B005HIBWCU,"Trooper Hook tells a story of hatred and ignorance.  Joel McCrae portrays a very believable sergeant; and Barbara Stanwyck portrays a woman who went through hell and came out proud (that she survived) and protective of her child.  She is happy to keep her pride to her self, but when hatred flares she takes command with actions and shouts of revenge.  I found the story seems to pull the viewer into the actions of the whites and the Indians.  Respect and honor goes with Trooper Hook",1366329600,4,485,4.604651162790698
