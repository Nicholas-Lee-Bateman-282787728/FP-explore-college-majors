261487,3,6300216489,"Questionable historical accuracy, actors unsuited for the parts (who chose these people?)and overacting galore--but still a movie to watch for these very reasons.  Alec Guinness did his best but IMO went over the top, even for a fanatical Hitler.  At times almost comical to watch, even given the subject matter.  Still, it has its moments and is definitely recommended for anyone interested in the final days of the Nazi leader.  Just don't expect a well-acted and accurate portrayal and you won't be disappointed.  Very entertaining in its own way despite its faults and B movie aura.",1084492800,6,586,5.0625
261488,5,6300216489,"This vivid portrait of Hitler in his wanning days is nothing short of magnificent.  This movie combines drama with documentry.  Actually footage is cleverly interspaced during the movie to provide shocking reality checks to the bizarre events occuring in the bunker.  In this movie we can see how Hitler became the victim of his own doomsday prophetcies.  His cruelty remained with him to the last, and Guiness provides a emotional look at the last few days of his life.  There will certainly be a debate over this movie and ""The Bunker"" with Anthony Hopkins.  For me this was always the better film in terms of its intensity.  The movie almost seems like a play and it moves along rapidly to its bitter finish.  Some may think Guinness is too high strung in his Hitler, but his acting is nonetheless superb.  Its seems almost like playing Hitler has become a main theatrical role to play.  If so then Alec Guinness provides the leading example.",1058400000,32,945,4.742331288343558
261489,4,6300216489,"So often Adolf Hitler has been portrayed in films as a raving psychotic, usually by actors physically unsuited for the part, with insultingly cheap stick-on mustaches. Finally Guinness delivers an accurate, temperate and sensible performance, giving viewers a glimpse of how Hitler really was. Guinness resembles Hitler to a reasonable degree and the script quotes from the Fuehrer's own table talk, so there is a degree of authenticity in the dialogue. The actress who portrays Eva Braun also comes up with a sober and fairly accurate portrayal of Hitler's mistress.
The plot is a bit plodding and the movie would be quite boring to anyone without a strong interest in WWII or the Third Reich. In addition, the ending of the movie is historically inaccurate and a trifle campy: Hitler and Eva never had an argument prior to their duel suicides.
Still, the reason for watching this movie is Alec Guinness' interesting performance as Hitler. Contrast his intelligent interpretation to the dozens of other inferior film Hitlers.",1056758400,5,1026,5.149700598802395
261490,5,6300216489,"The basis for the critique that ""this movie doesn't really work"" is beyond me.  I can't help but think that this film is underrated because it was made outside the U.S.  Indeed, it is an outstanding character study movie. The most enduring mystery about Adolf Hitler is why millions of people fell under his spell. Alec Guinness performance (unlike Anthony Hopkins's in ""The Bunker"") helps to answer this question by uncannily capturing the multifaceted aspects of the dictator's personality; the charismatic, nurturing cult figure as well as the ruthless villain.  The supporting cast is also superior.  Philip Stone is captivating as the defiant General Jodl among the purely servile likes of Goebbels (John Barron), Krebs (Adolfo Celi), and  Keitel (Gabriele Ferzetti). Mark Kingston also does a fine job of portraying the power-hungry, manipulative Martin Borman.
Although the movie takes some historical liberties (e.g., the fictional ""contrite Nazi"" character played by Simon Ward), it is overall far superior to the ""The Bunker.""",989020800,11,1036,5.409937888198757
261491,4,6300216489,"I think that this is one of the best films about Hitler's final days as the leader of Germany.  The film depicts the last few weeks of Hitler's life, how the Russians were advancing on Hitler's bunker and how the high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party and the large number of military officers that were down there planned their escape from Berlin.  The film was suspenseful and exciting.  It kept me entertained.  It wasn't depressing at all.  The cast in this film gave great performances especially the portrayal of Hitler.  I think that this a really great film.  It's really worth watching.",978825600,11,597,4.794117647058823
261492,5,6300216489,"'Hitler: the Last Ten Days"" is a very realistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler's days in the Berlin bunker. Alec Guinness plays history's most famous evil goofball very convincingly. The film presents verified events  in a very engaging manner. It's an expensive movie, but if you have any  interest in Adolf Hitler you will find it well worth the price. A film like  this makes one appreciate how incredible it is that a weirdo like Hitler  could have risen so high and done so much damage to humanity. To sum it up  in three words-buy this movie!",963532800,11,543,4.614583333333333
261493,5,6300216489,Hitler-The Last Ten Days is an historically accurate account of Adolph Hitler's last ten days in his Berlin bunker.

7806449,5,6300216489,"Alec Guinness was in incredible form in this Anglo-Italian movie about the last days of the demented dictator, alternately terrifying and lecturing his trapped flunkies and servants in his Berlin bunker. One moment he is complimenting his vegetarian cook on preparing cream buns, the next minute denouncing his old pals Himmler and Goering as traitors, screaming for their blood.

The supporting cast is brilliant, too, with a supportive Eva Braun, creeping Goebbels, crawling Bormann, and a semi-fictional Captain Hoffmann (based on Cavalry Captain Gerhardt Boldt, who was there) representing ordinary German officers caught up in the increasing insanity.

The breakdown of Germany is seen in the increasingly odder behavior of the Bunker denizens -- by the last couple of days, German SS guards and Blitzmaedel are having drinking and sex orgies, while shells whiz overhead. The sound track is mostly Hitler's favorite music: the trite melodies of Lehar and ""Die Fledermaus."" He also looks over his architectural models of Gross Linz and Berlin, which remind the viewer of the world he dreamed of, in which, as H.R. Trevor-Roper said, ""even the imagination would have no escape.""

Another interesting touch is the use of black-and-white footage of the actual war as it was being waged. When Timothy West starts the film as SS Dr. Brandt, talking about his ghastly experiments, with photos of the results, which set the tone of the movie. Other uses of contemporary film compare the realities of the war's final days with the dreams and unrealities in the Bunker.

An added opening bonus at the film's start is a brief narration of Hitler's rise to power by veteran journalist Alistair Cooke.

There are three movies on Hitler's last days...all are excellent. Hard to choose between the three.",1424131200,,1794,5.172413793103448

7806452,5,6300216489,"IF one could ever possibly dream that Hitler and the Nazis could be made into a camp send-up, then this movie is the dream become reality!!  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  Although based on REAL events that took place in Hitler's Bunker, there is obviously a GREAT deal of theatrical license at work in the dialogue.  You'll never believe what comes out of these people's mouths!  When Alec Guinness declares that there is ""no shortage of cream"" in the Bunker, I just completely lost it...  It's nowhere near as accurate as Downfall, but who needs accuracy when you've got an over the top Alec Guinness chewing up scenery and screaming at the top of his lungs.  It's an absolute LAUGH RIOT!!  Buy it, even on VHS.",1203897600,2,724,4.523076923076923
7806453,3,6300216489,"Alec Guinness' portrayal of Hitler was a lot more nuanced than Anthony Hopkins', but I still found it odd. His Hitler seemed strangely amused, more than anything else, as his entire world crumbled around him. (I guess he was just keeping a stiff British upper lip.) Like with the other pre-Untergang movies, you have the impression that the writers had a checklist of Bunker events they needed to provide dialogue for, and the director threw these scenes together with no regard for cohesion, tension or drama. The supporting cast was better than ""The Bunker"", but the movie was interrupted several times by Holocaust indoctrination segments, and the writers made this movie ridiculous by inserting a pre-suicide quarrel between Adolf and Eva. Buy ""Downfall""; this movie is a mere curiosity.",1196985600,3,791,5.1395348837209305
7806454,5,6300216489,This is a great war movie and a fine performance by Alec Guiness so when are they going to transfer it to a DVD format already.,1191888000,,127,3.923076923076923
7806455,1,6300216489,"Having watched the four ""bunker"" movies (Inside the Third Reich, The Bunker, Downfall and Hitler: The Last Ten Days) I can say beyond a doubt that this is not only the briefest, but the worst of the lot. If Hitler with a British accent doesn't turn you off the lame performances from the rest of the cast will. The script is 90% fiction with Hitler saying one moronic thing after another that he never actually uttered or doing things that never really happened, such as Eva committing suicide after she and Adolf have an argument. Pure fiction. About 10% of this film is old archival footage which serves only to slow down the story and waste valuable time when it is already in very short supply and needed to explain a quite complicated story. Without having read any of the books about the last days of Hitler (""The Bunker"" being the best) the average viewer will learn very little about the final days of Hitler from this film and will probably just end up being quite confused. Among many things it was almost impossible to pick out who the characters were among the many actors running about in two hours of general confusion. If you really want to understand what the final days of Hitler were like and need to do so in a film I'd check out ""Downfall"" or ""The Bunker"". ""Downfall"" is probably the best but requires patience as it is only available in German language. For those of you with less patience go with ""The Bunker"". ""Inside the Third Reich"" is also a great film although it covers the complete life of Albert Speer, not just the bunker and Hitler. Whatever you do, do NOT pay some preposterous price for this garbage movie.",1140134400,10,1640,4.543918918918919
7806456,5,6300216489,"Alec Guinness becomes Hitler, and it is the most realistic portrayal I've ever seen. Derek Jacoby and Anthony Hopkins come no where close to this in their respective films, Inside The Third Reich and The Bunker. This is like a color camera capturing Hitler speaking in English. It is frightening yet has touches of humor, especially when the announcement of Hitlers death is made to the other residents of the bunker, you see a pretty blond woman reach for her small case containing cyanide capsules and cigarettes. She chooses the cigarettes and she and everyone else in the room light up. The most memorable line in the film is Hitler trying to conjure up some of the old charismatic magic of the past, addressing a young captain played by Simon Ward. ""The Gods give their love only to those who demand the impossible. Mankind is ruled by will, by determination. When the will is thrust by genius, it generates a force which throughout history has proved irresistible"". Great film. Now if only it were released on DVD.",1106956800,7,1020,4.768361581920904
7806457,2,6300216489,"Sir Alec Guinness' portrayal of the Nazi leader in the final days of the Third Reich was to say the least, chilling.  He had the madman down, though questions of accuracy regarding Hitler's state of being at that time did not get the full treatment.

The possibility that Hitler was suffering from Parkinson's Disease (i.e., the confirmed trembling) and the wracked state of his body and mind thanks to Dr. Morrell's drugs was not really dealt with here.

The part of Hitler's musings, going on about the good old days and what he planned to do after the war was over, this was true.  How Hitler could detach himself from the reality that was the bunker and the destruction of the world around him and talk about buildings, monuments and the like...this was confirmed, that he spent a great deal of time babbling about these things.

Also, some of the events do not appear to have been accurate -- a girl showing up to get Iron Crosses and witnessing the execution of Hermann Fegelein has not been confirmed.  Fegelein, the SS liasion to Hitler and who married Gretl Braun, Eva's sister was hauled back to the bunker and executed, that is true, but Eva's upset reaction to this does not appear to have been the case.  Apparently, she did nothing to stop Fegelein's shooting, even though she knew about it.

In addition, Hitler's ranting at Eva right before their suicides does not appear to have occurred.  There were people, including Martin Bormann and Heinz Linge (Hitler's valet) right outside the door to the room where it happened.  They didn't hear that, though they did hear the shot that killed Hitler.

The movie suffers from a real feeling of short funds, though it may have been made this way to look bleak.

I have noticed many comparisons of Guinness' performance to that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in ""The Bunker.""  Hopkins was also masterful, though that movie had its problems, too.

This one is interesting for Guinness' great performance as Hitler, but that is about all that holds it together.",1103587200,,2009,4.735632183908046
