8357659,5,B002997SIC,"This is wonderful for stress relief.  On TV, it has soothing sights of beaches and scenery, and if you close your eyes, the hypnosis is very relaxing and soothing.  I have anxiety and meditation actually can cause me to think more which is the problem I have already - I just want to listen, relax and decompress, and this DVD does that.",1458000000,,337,4.419354838709677

I got it from the local library right after a relationship breakup with a long-term partner that was extremely devastating for me. I renewed this DVD from the library three times and played THE SESSION track at least a hundred times. It helped me tremendously. A few months after this I had major surgery and it is helping me recover both emotionally and physically. Since I started listening to this DVD I lost 32 pounds and felt more alive, positive and hopeful after listening to it...
I struggle daily with dysthymia (low grade depression,)  CFIDS and fibromyalgia. Listening to this DVD has really shifted my mood to a more positive frame of mind. A close friend who is a trained therapist noticed the improvement in my mood after listening to Stress Relief.

Susan's message is positive, encouraging and calming...She should make a CD out of the ""Session"" track. She repeats this session in the DVD..once with a ""patient"" and once with beautiful scenery and the sound of ocean waves in the background (my favorite track!) The image of ""Opening the window of your mind"" through an image and ""airing it out"" to let out anger, lethargy, frustration and to let in ""sunlight and fresh air"" is especially helpful and powerful.

One of my favorite statements in the DVD is ""you can do anything you want to..as long as it is realistic!""...Her overall message is balanced and applicable to people in a wide range of circumstances... both encouraging optimism as well as realism.  One phrase is particularly uplifting for me: how you are meant to ""Enjoy life not ENDURE it""

 Her voice is low and has an English accent and is very calming and soothing. A friend of mine bought it for me as a 'post surgery' gift on Amazon! Now I will be taking it to CA with me to have ""Stress Relief"" during a ""visit with family!""",1263945600,12,1873,4.657575757575757
