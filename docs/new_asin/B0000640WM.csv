7960226,1,B0000640WM,"The acting in Playin for the Kitty leaves a lot to be desired.  I love the scene where one actress is reading from the menu and says ""I'd like the salmon"", mispronouncing the word salmon and pronouncing the 'L'.  Despite the fact that he didn't contribute to the storyline, the token Caucasian guy didn't bother me.  It's 2004, brothers are allowed to have white friends!
That being said, this was a low budget movie, and expectations should take that into consideration.  This was not a ""Spike Lee joint"".  The budget didn't allow for Halle Berry and Denzel Washington, (although even low budget actresses should know how to correctly pronounce 'salmon'!).
The public should support up and coming filmmakers.  The fault here lies with the distributors for not editing the movie better, making the story shorter and cutting out unnecessary scenes.  A professional distributor would have caught on to the extreme length of the movie and its poor film quality before it got to the store shelves. It seems the distributor put more thought into the well chiseled men on the front cover of the DVD box than anything else!",1084579200,,1116,4.873015873015873
7960227,2,B0000640WM,"One of the few films in Dallas, Texas and it's horrible. I didn't like seeing a token white guy in the movie in one scene. Why was he there? I do filming and could have done a better job. I would have at least changed the bedroom to be different instead of having love scenes in the same bed.",1045267200,,292,3.9661016949152543
7960228,2,B0000640WM,"With a name like ""Playin' for the Kitty,"" I thought this movie would be about football/gambling and be like ""Any Given Sunday.""  Instead, the title is a double entendre and this movie is about Black hetero relationships like ""The Brothers.""  The viewer does get to see lots of hot black male torsos and rippling arms.  Also, one female love interest has a huge gap in her teeth, and you don't see that much on screen, but a lot in the real-life black community.  Cheers for that actress!  However, this movie had a poor, capricious conflict, resolution, and conclusion.  It's filled with fights, slapping and other violence that is so fake and poorly filmed the viewer will almost gag from laughter.  They have this one white doctor that looks just like Anthony Edwards on ""ER"", as if all doctors are balding, bespectacled,white males.  This movie has a token white pal that never says a single word.  I hated the way the token white in ""Barbershop"" was put on a pedestal, but in this movie it made no sense to have the character if he wasn't ever going to speak and explain why all his friends were black.  I love seeing black actors and actesses getting paid, but this was a big ole dish of low-budgetness for the masses.  Plus, like ""The Brothers,"" this is another ""chick flick"" film disguised as a black man's movie.",1035244800,2,1320,4.622317596566524
