2469104,2,B000CQO6IY,I love Bob Hoskins but not enough to have the image of his penis burned into my memory.  You've been warned. Hoskins and Dench share some witty banter but other than a decent line here and there this movie is not up to much.,1483833600,,224,4.090909090909091

2469160,4,B000CQO6IY,"I just didn't see this one coming. The considerable nudity was handled in a very artistic fashion. It wasn't sexual- it was admiration of the female form. (It was nice to see even brief shots of nude men in a non-sexual context-that RARELY happens in movies.) I adore Judi Dench in just about anything, and I love Bob Hoskins. Hoskins plays a serious theater manager who truly cares for the girls and maintains a sense of decorum. There are some unexpected underlying plot lines to watch for. While it's most definitely an adults-only movie, it approaches it all from the highest plain possible.",1483056000,,595,4.786407766990291

2469165,4,B000CQO6IY,"As always, Judi does not disappoint. Great story about a wealthy bored eccentric widow.  What to do but buy a theater and transform it? It goes from there...great comedy and some pathos also.  Worth the watch!",1482883200,,209,4.777777777777778

2469209,5,B000CQO6IY,"Besides the fact that Judi Dench and all the other actors are excellent, the storyline is outstanding.  The story takes place during the Blitz of WW2 and it is extremely funny and, at the same time, poignant.  If you want to be entertained, watch Mrs. Henderson Presents.",1482624000,,271,4.74468085106383

2469495,4,B000CQO6IY,"Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins offer memorable performances as the owner and manager respectively of a burlesque theater in London during WWII. To beat the competition, they provide nonstop shows and, later, introduce tableaus of nude women who, to meet official censorship requirements, must remain immobile through the course of their act. The addition of large crowds of soldiers around and in the theater complete the picture that Mrs. Henderson (Judi Dench) Presents. The movie is thus doubly constrained in terms of both locale and possible action. There are moments of joy and great sadness, all enveloped in patriotic fervor. In this milieu, Dench and Hoskins develop a relationship of mutual respect that ultimately turns into a sort of platonic love. It is a film that offers the viewer an uncomplicated, pleasant sojourn into another time and place. 3 1/2 stars.",1479254400,,869,5.170212765957447

2469500,3,B000CQO6IY,"Watched this because of the cast, Dench & Hoskins. I did enjoy the beautiful women in their native state but the plot was lightweight and it ran too long.

2469501,2,B000CQO6IY,"This should've been an adorable between-the-wars story of a rather broad-minded elderly widow who buys a theater to keep herself occupied. The story was cute and fun, but then it takes a horrible turn where it tries to take itself seriously. Yes, ""war bad,"" I get it. There are stacks and stacks of movies with that message. I think the ""message"" at the end ruined the entire movie. It could've been funnier--there were many opportunities. Judi Dench is wonderfully funny with the right direction and material. She had moments in this one, but she couldn't save the entire movie by herself. Those moments ALMOST make it worth watching, but not quite. I wouldn't recommend it.",1479168000,,675,4.878260869565217

2469525,5,B000CQO6IY,"Humorous, but sad are words that come to mid as I reflect on the movie. Judi Dench is wonderful in a role that gives her an opportunity to show her comedic side as well as her sympathetic and sad side. The women who portrayed the showgirls that performed in Mrs. Henderson's show are well cast and displayed their charms quite well, but not gratuitously. Bob Hoskins is excellent as the experienced and worldly showman who is the guiding force behind Mrs. Henderson's success. The movie does a great job at conveyeing the ambience during WWii in London while showing the indominable spirit and sense of humor of people while surviving the merciless bombing of the German Luftwaffe. The movie gives an excellent, but somewhat subtle anti-war message.",1446854400,,749,4.905511811023622

2469659,4,B000CQO6IY,"A delightful movie that traces the little known history of the Windmill theatre in London. Judi Dench is superb as Mrs. Henderson the original proprietor of the theatre which she acquired in 1937. The Windmill was famous (or notorious) as the first theatre in England to stage nude actors, but only in the form of tableaux: the Lord Chamberlin was having no movement and as the censor his word was final. The introduction of nudity wasn't simply a commercial ploy but, as revielled  towards the end of the movie, had a more poignant reason. Surprisingly the Windmill stayed open, around the clock, throughout the war years, despite the bombing of London and provided great entertainment for the troops home on leave. I highly recommend this unexpectedly delightful movie.",1427328000,,771,5.0234375

2469665,4,B000CQO6IY,"I had never heard of this movie when it was in the theatre, but found it a good watch on DVD.  Dench is my favorite and she does a great job as Mrs Henderson, a rich widow who decides to splurge after her husband dies and buy a rundown old theatre, the Windmill.  She hires Van Damm (played by Hoskins) to manage the theatre and they have a sparring love-hate relationship that amuses them as much as those watching it.  At first, they decide to stand out by running their shows all the time, but when other theatres follow suit, Mrs Henderson has the idea to have nudes in their show.  This is a huge deal in the late 1930's and, fortunately, she knows the powers in govt and sweet talks them into seeing the nudes as art, so long as no one moves and the lighting shadows them tastefully.

The move is based off the real story of the Windmill Theatre and the crew of regular English girls who agreed to pose nude--called the Millerettes--and the additions to the DVD include interviews with the remaining real Millerettes.  Set against pre-war England and WW2, this illuminates a story that few of us knew anything about.  Dench gives a wonderful performance and her speech about why the Windmill should remain open is very well done and quite touching.",1427241600,,1254,4.497797356828194

2469696,3,B000CQO6IY,"Mrs. Henderson Presents, 2004 film

It begins at a funeral in 1937 England for Mr. Henderson. The mourners depart in autos from that era. How inconsiderable of him to die. The widow volunteers for charity work. [Is she suitable in personality?] She see a building for sale in London. Her son died in the Great War. Who will run it? Laura hires Mr. Van Damm. [An owner who doesnt know the business?] The Windmill theater will run all day long, 5 or 6 shows a day. Actors line up for jobs; many are rejected. There are girls dancing in shorts, high kicking steps. The show goes on. This Revue de ville is a hit until others copy it. Would naked girls draw an audience? Just like in Paris. That isn't done here. They will need a license. But there are rules. They compare it to an art gallery, still figures like statues. What about the midlands?

Breasts come in different sizes, like shoes. Fried eggs. Can they find the right personalities? [Riding a bicycle in pouring rain?] The girls are told to disrobe, but they are bashful. They will be taken to a museum tomorrow. The audience applauds lightly. The Lord Chamberlain visits back stage. Laura is scolded by Van Damm for snubbing his wife. They show various scenes. This is serious business. Mrs. Henderson revisits the theater. A polar bear dances. Laura inquires about her workers. She flies in a biplane to France to see her sons grave (dead in 1915, gas attack).

Then its WW II. Hitler visited Paris. Can Mrs. Henderson provide help to victims? What will happen now? German bombers attack London. The show goes on. We will never close says Van Damm. They entertain soldiers who appreciate these live shows. There are events to pad out the story. One performer wants to leave for family reasons. Was she deceived? A bomb blast ends the discussion. Does Laura know anything about the Real World? There is a letter from the Lord Chamberlain, they are being shut down. Mrs. Henderson addresses the crowd and explains why the show will go on.

This is an interesting movie about show business that is not well known. Note how the nobility can bypass laws that affect ordinary people. Mrs. Henderson obtained special permission that prevented competition to her theater. That Moulin Rouge (red mill) in Paris featured the Can-Can dance and had a restaurant; also rooms that could be rented by the hour. The book Royal Babylon tells about the European aristocracy and their habits. You will learn interesting facts about their lives and how it sometimes affected history. We Never Closed was the boast of those businesses that stayed open during The Blitz, the bombing of London.",1424822400,,2631,4.737991266375546
2469697,1,B000CQO6IY,We couldn't get it to play,1424649600,,26,3.5
2469698,4,B000CQO6IY,"Between 1997 and 2005 the British movie making people produced four movies all based on fact and just naughty enough. In each the moral seem to be that a certain amount of naughty is nice if it is sufficiently noble.

First, out of work and out of shape men turned strippers in: The Full Monty in order to pay their bills. This movie made enough money to help green light what followed. What followed was a movie about ladies of a certain age posing in the altogether to raise charity money with the calendar hence the name Calendar Girls. Back to the man we had a shoe factory owner shifting to high-fashion boots specifically for male cross-dressing performers needing to wear ""18 inches of sex appeal"" in Kinky Boots. With Mrs. Henderson Presents we have a very rich newly widowed woman bringing female nudity to Britain's West End for what we will find are her own noble reasons.

Backed with a regular display of very lovely if static nude females and some nicely performed 1940s music; Mrs. Henderson Presents is basically a two person movie with Dame Judy Dench a sprightly and twinkle eyed lady of more than a certain age and a no longer young but very well match performance by Bob Hoskins as her theatrical producer Mr. Vivian Van Damm. Pop singer and songwriter Will Young Is the sometimes stiff but game lead singer for Ms. Henderson's vaudeville like stage troop. Actress Kelly Reilly plays Maureen the lithe young blonde who will give a personal identity to the mostly nameless other ladies of the show.

Most of the dialogue given to Dame Judy Dench is wry and amusing. As always she is the master of presenting her lines with just the right accent and just the right twinkle. In a number of scenes she and Mr. Hoskins are supposed to be arguing with some ferocity. Ferocity is not appropriate to the otherwise lighter and amused attitude of this movie and so none of these disagreements are very convincing. Director Stephen Frears never allows emotions to get high. This is a light entertainment and there really is no need for any great depth in the emotions.

Everything about Mrs. Henderson presents speaks of light entertainment and just enough history and purposefulness that this can be a date night or a family movie. There is nudity aplenty but appropriate to the story and never presented as titillation (yes it's a pun but it had to be said). If this combination works for your family this is a pleasant and relaxing movie.",1424390400,,2450,4.677494199535963
2469699,4,B000CQO6IY,"I liked this movie, but was not totally fascinated with it.  I like Stephen Frears as a director, and he did remarkably well with making this feel like the era it happened in from costumes, to stage settings, to props, and all that goes into a period piece.  Having said all that, it still left me feeling as though something was missing. as in ""it's not great, but it's ok"".",1424390400,,375,4.3428571428571425
2469700,3,B000CQO6IY,An engaging beginning to a film that relies on the wonderful chemistry between the brilliant Hoskins and Dench but badly loses its path midway and falls into sentiment and poor plotting.,1424390400,,186,5.032258064516129

2469702,5,B000CQO6IY,"I chose to watch this because of Judi Dench, and I'm so glad.  Full of surprises. I didn't read any reviews first, and didn't know the story of this theater, so I was able to enjoy the unexpected directions the film took.  Perfect pacing,amazing acting.  My husband walked by and was sucked into watching it too, and he had tears streaming down his face at times. He's more sentimental about movies, especially movies featuring young men going to war.  It wasn't what I expected from the opening credits sequence (very well done) and first part of the movie.  I wish I'd seen it years ago.  This will be a favorite I'll watch again.  Nudity, including full frontal male nudity, might offend some people--but it isn't gratuitous and it's historically accurate and quite essential to the story. A mature older teenager might watch if interested in history and theater, but please, this is where the phrase ""parental guidance"" applies. (Our grandparents didn't pixelate nipples yet!)  If you don't laugh out loud at some points and feel your eyes sting with tears at others, you aren't fully human....",1423958400,,1098,4.865591397849462

This would have been better as a tv mini-series.  There were a number of characters that could have been better developed if this had been longer.  As it is, it just gives a very brief story of a theatre during World War II.  I really wish it was longer.",1421452800,,411,4.075

2469709,5,B000CQO6IY,"Judi Dench is one of my favorite actors and she lives up to her rating in this movie cast in wartime London. The very wealthy Mrs. Henderson (Dench), coming to terms with the loose-ends feelings imposed by recent widowhood, buys a derelict theater in the West End and renovates it. She hires Vivian Van Damm (the delightful Bob Hopkins) as producer and manager, embarking on a prickly relationship complicated by her hope for more than a professional relationship with Van Damm. In order to promote the success of her venture, Mrs. Henderson decides to pursue the unheard-of presentation of on-stage nudity ""like they do in France,"" which requires her influence with government officials to allow her plan to come forth.

2469764,4,B000CQO6IY,"Based on true events and real people, ""Ms Henderson Presents"" is the story of a widow who buys a theatre after her husband's death, keeping it open throughout the course of World War II and the London bombings. Despite the backdrop of the war (and at least one on-screen tragedy), it's light and frivolous entertainment, carried by the charm of Judi Dench as Laura Henderson and Bob Hoskins as her stage manager Vivian Van Damm.

Having already lost her young son in the First World War, Laura is recently widowed and bored to tears. To her friend she says: ""It was most inconsiderate of Robert to die; what on earth am I supposed to do now?"" On a whim she buys a theatre, despite having no idea how it should be run. For this she hires Vivian Van Damm, a man who has at least one revolutionary idea to set the Windmill apart from other theatres: to keep the performances running non-stop, averaging about five or six a day.

It's initially a great success, but when the other theatres copy them and revenue starts to go down, Ms Henderson comes up with an even more radical plan. She suggests that they present naked girls on the stage. Everyone is dumbfounded by this, especially since such a thing would require a license from the Lord Chamberlain. But Ms Henderson has the matter in hand, and by insisting on a correlation to works of art one would see in a gallery, is given permission to go ahead. There is only one condition: that much like the paintings and sculptures in a gallery, none of the girls are allowed to move.

Despite the initial nerves of the girls being asked to pose nude, the show is a great success. And then another setback: the Second World War. Now Ms Henderson and Mr Van Damm fight the imminent closure of the theatre by government officials, even as the Blitz goes on around them.

Because the film covers the events of several years, it is quite episodic in nature, as opposed to a three-act structure. Think of it as a storyline that focuses on the highlights of the Windmill's history, with a few little subplots strewn in along the way. Some of these don't really go anywhere (Vivian's wife is introduced only to never appear again, Laura's friend Lady Conway disappears halfway through the film without explanation, and one of the nude performers gets into a bit of trouble with a soldier in a storyline that is cut short so abruptly that you wonder why they bothered with it in the first place) but the pacing is brisk and the characters compelling.

Laura Henderson is brazen, eccentric and rather rude most of the time, but what could have been a charmless character is made likeable by Judi Dench's charisma. In many ways Laura is going through her second childhood and treats the theatre much like an elaborate game, but at the film's conclusion she shares her inspiration for the nude revue, revealing a much more complex side than her colleges ever gave her credit for. Bob Hoskins as Vivian Van Damm holds his own as her stage manager, and it's clear that despite (or perhaps because of) their disagreements, bickering and insults, they are happiest in each other's company. They have strong chemistry and bounce off each other beautifully.

Also featured is Will Young (a past British Pop Idol winner) as the theatre's male singer, who confides in Ms Henderson that he ""has other inclinations"" and a few familiar faces among the nudist girls, namely Kelly Reilly and Natalia Tena, who are now respectively best known for their roles in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B0038P59A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes</a>&nbsp;as Mary Morstan, and Nymphadora Tonks in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B0012GE91W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;franchise.

The film doesn't shy away from full-frontal nudity (from both men and women) but it's handled respectfully and isn't sexual or gratuitous in any way. Both the theatre and the film stresses that it's art, and it's difficult to imagine anyone being offended by what's on display. Neither a drama or a comedy (let's call it a dramedy) ""Ms Henderson Presents"" focuses on a small but memorable part of British history, and what this little theatre meant to those involved in its inception, the soldiers that frequented it, and its place as a landmark in London's colourful past.",1361232000,,4420,5.063186813186813

2469770,5,B000CQO6IY,"This little film is a delight. It's unexpected and a throw-back to another, more innocent time. With nudes. Sweet nudes.  Mrs. Henderson was a real person; and she really bought a theater in the West End. The Windmill kept lips (and one assumes other bodily parts) stiff and morale high during the Blitz. The theater's motto was ""We Never Closed."" In the film, as in life, the Windmill Girls were ""squeaky clean"" -- and expected to behave as ladies. And somehow, when the Nazi bombs were falling, these lovely ladies became heroines of the Empire. They really did.

Mrs. Henderson Presents is ""based on a true story,"" so just consider it an homage to her and her beloved Windmill Theatre.  And as an homage, it's silly and wonderful and just enough Bad Things Happen to make it a good story. One of my favorite scenes gives whole new meaning to the thirties classic pop song ""Goody-Goody."" Because the movie takes place during the Blitz, there are soldiers who won't come home and an unplanned pregnancy that ends ""getting some air"" as so many lives did in those days. But for the most part, Mrs. Henderson Presents succeeded in keeping my contemporary chin up for the duration of the movie. It took me back to a more innocent time, when Strong Men and Brave Women were fighting the Good War -- one that changed our world forever and ever.

My late father, Wild Bill Rigney, who fought in the Pacific Theater during the Good War, loved this movie. He loved all movies about strong women who did their part. With Nudes.  Judi Dench is perfect as the deliciously goofy Mrs. Henderson. And Bob Hoskins is, well, himself.(Warning: the full frontal of Bob Hoskins in the least sexy Nude shot in the history of film. Be afraid. Be VERY afraid.)

2469780,5,B000CQO6IY,"This is a movie based on a true story in Britain during the late 1930s. Mrs. Henderson, a rich recently widowed elderly British woman. She is not the type to spend her last days watching the Dust Bunnies gather. As a personal interest she purchases and remodels an old theater.
After a successful run of a production public interest dwindles, as it always does. To recapture the public's interest and avoid the liquidation of her business she had to invent a new production with fresh ideas, thus nudity in burlesque. (As you probably know Burlesque did not start out with nude dancers or acts.)
In the 1930s nudity in a public venue except for brothels was strictly taboo. In order for her to circumvent the censorship of that period she had to incorporate nudity in her productions as an art form.
During World War II everything changed especially in Britain. During an air raid you could be jailed, if you survived, for leaving a light on and a window shade open. Large Public gatherings were forbidden to prevent mass causalities, which would overwhelm the much-stressed out public services. The public gave up everything but the bare minimum to support the troops and the war effort. That is when the motivating factor behind her business changed to entertaining the troops, as most entertainment venues did during that time. Try viewing her as the British version of a female Bob Hope.
If you're expecting a movie with a hundred thousand dollar screenplay and hundreds of millions spent to produce the movie, this is not it. Or expecting a movie which will keep you cross legged on the edge of you seat, to keep from peeing your pants, again this is not that movie.
But if you would like to view a good British movie depicting a true story during a horrible period in our history, then you will be entertained.",1317513600,,1816,4.713836477987422

2469783,5,B000CQO6IY,"We bought this movie at the recommendation of a Londonwalks tour guide(neat outfit, highly recommend, btw) , after she happened to mention it during a walking tour that included Picadilly Circus. Her story intrigued us, so I ordered it when we got back.

What a fantastic movie! Judi Dench plays to perfection , Bob Hoskins is easily her equal, and I knew nothing of Will Young, but looked him up after the movie and will be buying some of his CDs. Speaking of which, I have already ordered and received the fabulous soundtrack for this movie. Soundtrack is ten thumbs up, as well.

Basic premise of the movie is that, a few years before WWII,  giddy, bored, upper crust widow Dench buys a theatre on a whim, and hires Hoskins to manage it. When attendance goes south, she surprises society by incorporating nudity in her show, her ostensible reason being that Paris has the Moulin Rouge, and a stellar world city like London ought to have the same. Her real reason, of course, is surprisingly far more personal, and she is far less giddy than she lets on.

Be forewarned that there is a lot of nudity in this movie, but it is very tastefully done, since it is done in the same conventions as the era. My movie rule of thumb is, ""would I watch this with my 73 year old dad?""  Not only would I watch it with them, I've been begging my folks to watch it. They would love it. The nudity is incidental, yet integral to the story.

There's not really much plot to the movie, but it moves along at a good pace, there's a few tearjerking moments, the art, choreography, singing, dance, and costumes are A+, and if nothing else, it's worth it to watch Dame Judy Dench charm, rather than chew, her way through the part. She gets lovelier the older she gets, and she just lights up the screen in this period piece.

Oh, why can't all movies be this surprisingly good?",1291507200,,1857,4.444117647058824
2469784,5,B000CQO6IY,"All fact-based comparisons aside, Dame Judi Dench is absolutely brilliant as Mrs Henderson.  I couldn't help but think that her portrayal of a free-thinking new widow approaching her 8th decade of life is a perfect role model for the philosophy of the Red Hat Society.  From their website the RHS ""supports and encourages women to pursue fun, friendship, freedom, fulfillment of lifelong dreams and fitness.""  For political reasons the RHS may not embrace the content of the film, but they'd find no argument with Mrs Henderson's quick observations and expressive outlook on life.  ""Are you American?  (Yes)  Strange people, lovely manners.""

Bob Hoskins is Dame Judi's talented equal in the movie.  His portrayal of Vivian Van Damm carries the weight necessary to match Dame Judi's character.

The film works for a wide audience because it is a combination drama, war movie, comedy, and musical containing both female and male nudity, all of which work beautifully together.  Unfortunately the moviehouse trailer, and possibly the movie's name, failed to open the movie to the audience it truly deserves.  ""Life My Way"" or ""Who Give's a Fiddler's F..., There I said It"" would have opened people's mind to the personal appeal of the movie.  This is one truly enjoyable period piece.

If you need an excuse, buy the film for any family retiree you know who still has a memory connection to the last world war.  Slip it in the player then sit and watch the movie with them.  I dare you not to enjoy it.",1289606400,,1500,4.873517786561265
2469785,2,B000CQO6IY,"**This review contains spoilers**

I agree with some of the other negative posters here that the premise of the film is disingenuous. We're supposed to admire Mrs. Henderson for keeping her theater open in the name of free thought but her true motive is personal profit. And was Mrs. Henderson's operation really that admirable to begin with? I don't think so. In the end it was nothing more than a mediocre burlesque show. Furthermore, I couldn't understand why anyone would keep coming back to see a bunch of nude women stand on a stage completely frozen like statutes.

The film lacked an identifiable antagonist and the conflict between Mrs. Henderson and her business manager, Van Dam, became annoying and tiresome after awhile. On the plus side, Judi Dench for the most part displays a great deal of wit and energy in her interpretation of Mrs. Henderson who is determined not to be beaten down by old age. Sometimes however there are stretches during the film that Mrs. Henderson disappears.

Overall the plot to this film is quite slight. The first third is taken up with Mrs. Henderson convincing the Lord Chamberlain to allow nude performances. Toward the end Mrs. Henderson must battle the Lord Chamberlain again as he threatens to close the theater due to safety issues during wartime. In between, a romance between Mrs. Henderson and Van Dam never blossoms into anything more than a platonic friendship. You also never really get to know the chorus girls who come off as basically unlikeable. There is also a distasteful scene where Van Dam blames Mrs. Henderson for the death of one of the chorus girls after she has fixed her up with a soldier (the chorus girl leaves the theater and is killed during one of the German bombings of London).

Overall, Mrs. Henderson is a disappointing experience. It attempts to elevate an essentially mediocre enterprise to the level of art and distorts history by suggesting the principal characters in the story were in some way heroic.",1286841600,,1986,4.884272997032641

2469788,5,B000CQO6IY,"If I might add to the mix of reviews of this delightful film, my comments center upon the interplay between a wealthy widow, Judi Dench,  who lost her son 20 years earlier in that horrid waste of young men proclaimed (until Adolph Hitler laid bare the absurdity of it) ""The War to End All Wars"" and a person she initiially views as a member of the plebian underclass, played by Bob Hoskins.  This in and of itself is worth the price of admission, but my favorite scene is of Dame Dench and Christopher Guest (the 6-fingered man of ""The Princess Bride"") as the two sit for what ostensibly is a tent lunch on Mrs. Henderson's estate, but is really a set-up out of which the lady wishes to secure from Guest, as Lord Comer, governmental permission (or at least non-interference) for women to bare their breasts on stage.  Guest's comedic timing is hysterical.  That scene ranks as one of the top five I have ever seen.",1271462400,,915,4.493975903614458

2469790,3,B000CQO6IY,"Worth a look for its enthusiastic look at a little known story in wartime England.  Having said that, the movie feels very ""writerly"".  For example, Mrs. Henderson's ultimate motivation for starting her adult show is a little too neat (though her speech at the end describing that motivation is undeniably moving). Also, the film has a couple of obvious ""composite"" characters, one in the government and one among the girls, the former simplifying the opposition of undoubtedly many government officials at the time and the latter representing all the ups and downs and tragedies that many of the girls likely experienced during that dangerous period when the bombs regularly fell on London.  On these points, I'd rather have seen a better attempt at describing what actually went on instead of a simplification for story purposes.  Finally, there's a halfhearted attempt at some kind of love relationship between Mrs. Henderson and Bob Hoskins' manager character (fueled by an irritating scene of jealousy when Mrs. Henderson finds out Hoskins' character is married), but then the whole thing is sort of dropped.  Anyway, as said, the movie is worth a viewing just for the fact that it illuminates a little known piece of history, and many of the burlesque scenes aren't bad, either.  The standard, widescreen DVD looks and sounds very good, and there are a handful of interesting extra features, though- sadly- no newsreel or historical footage of the actual show's heyday.",1245628800,,1475,5.125

The actor and actress are no doubt excellent in their performance.  The effort the director put in is obvious to seperate this movie from the normal adult movie.  Stressing the art part and convincing the young woman to post nude is not an easy job.  The nude part for the male actors are brief enough to make the ponint, frankly, not much worth watching.  The movie truly reflects a time of breaking through in the show business with a very sad reasons behind.  It helps me to understand the English people better.  I like the music very much.  The only bad part is that I can not share the movie with my parents or relative without some worries about what they think about me.

The glossy Rita Hayworth vehicle of 1945 put it's focus on its glamorous star who was cast as one of the dancers at The Windmill.  There was only a nod in the direction of the actual Mrs Henderson.  No mention of nude showgirls (it's 40s Hollywood, afterall)  This newer production trumps in every category.  The performances, of course, but also the cinematography, the color, costumes, dialogue and the overall  feeling of the period.  I don't think you have to have a deep nostalgia for those years to appreciate and, quite possibly, feel a real affection for this movie.",1221264000,,720,4.704
2469794,4,B000CQO6IY,"An interestingly charming based-on-a-true story of Mrs. Henderson (Judi Dench), a widowed upper-class woman in pre-WWII London who decided on a lark to buy a theater, The Windmill.  Teaming up with theatrical manager Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins), they were an instant success with all-day revues but then started losing money once everyone started to copy their product.  The solution?  Nude girls, of course; however, this being the 1930s, nude dancing girls were beyond the pale.  How they get around this little problem in dealing with the Lord Chamberlain (Christopher Guest in a nice little supporting role) is one of the fun parts of the movie.

Then it turns darker as WWII approaches, with various problems of the Blitz (the Windmill staked it's reputation on being the only theater in the West End to never closed, helped by it's being below street level).  The movie never gets too dark, though, even as the bombs fall and soldiers head off to the front, due to some lovely light acting by both Dench and Hoskins and a fine supporting cast in the girls (led by an actress previously unknown to me, Kelly Reilly (seen above with Dench)).  Light writing and directing (this is probably the fluffiest thing I've ever seen from Frears, though it has odd tone similarities to High Fidelity) keep things on an even keel and it all turns into a nice frothy concoction that's just fun to watch.",1219276800,,1397,4.820083682008368

2469796,5,B000CQO6IY,"The genius of comedy lies in showing us truth with a smile.  That is why comedies in fact reveal deeper truths about about the human spirit than any drama.  You would never know it from most critics and serious people, but in the long run comedies often outlast their dramtic contemporaries and we are still quoting from them years after they appear. As one example, even if another film won the Oscar I agree with Roger Ebert that JUNO was easily the best film of 2007.  And we will be watching it long after the Oscar winner (whoever that was) is forgotten.

So how about a comedy based upon a real event. Might that be even deeper and more meaningful?  It is at least possible that it would and in this gem it actually proves to be so. While there are a lot of elements of this story that are fictionalized the main story in fact really happened: The really was a Mrs Henderson and she really did do what the film shows her doing. And London was the richer for it.  No doubt most of the details were fiction, but the main outline was truth.  And so on the framework of this real, true story a genuine masterpeice has been constructed.  I thought that the various elements, including the tragic notes, were mixed wonderfully and the Ms Dench's performance was pitch perfect, but so were the performances of many of the other actors in this film. To the extent that the story may appear contrived to some I think that this was simply reflects the tension of presenting a work of fiction that is built on a historical fact: History and Art bumping in to each other.  This film had moments of witty repartee and of slapstick, but also some very emotional poignant ones, quite appropriate to celebrating the triumph of a people who withstood a terrible situation.",1208736000,,1761,4.495297805642633
2469797,4,B000CQO6IY,"The print ads would have you expect ""Mrs Henderson Presents"" to be high-brow exploitation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The film is a celebration of womanhood and extolls the beauty of women particularly in it's naked form.  The film has many positive attributes.  Primarily the lead performances of Judi Dench as the backer of vaudvillean review shows who suggests nudity in her productions not out of the profit motive but more for altruistic reasons.  Bob Hoskins is also outstanding as the gruff producer that Mrs. Henderson hires.  The dynamic between these two fine actors is kinetic.  There's the initial antagonism that evolves into a mutual respect between the two that ultimately leads to a platonic love.  Christopher Guest gives a good turn as the stuffy Lord Chamberlain and Kelly Reilly gives a memorable account as an ill-fated performer.  The film is anchored by the sure hand of master director Stephen Frears and the film sports very authentic detail for the period it's covering, England between 1937 and 1942.

Based on true events, this movie tells the story of The Windmill Theatre, it's owner (Dench/Henderson), the people involved in the theater and the effects of the war on these people.

Detail has been gone over by many other reviewers so I won't do that. Suffice to say this film was quite a nice suprise to me. I have always loved Dench and have always thought Hoskins one of the most underrated actors of our time. This film proves both points.

As far as how the film developes, it changes pace in the second half just as life would have when the war moved into England. There is no other way things could have gone.

But the progression and development of the characters is real and tangible. Dench and the others should have won some sort of award for this movie. But, alas, most really good films are ignored in Hollywood.

2469815,3,B000CQO6IY,"Fact-based comedy drama `Mrs. Henderson Presents' stars delightful Judi Dench as the titular character. Wealthy Mrs. Henderson, 70 years old and recently widowed, buys a disclosed theater Windmill in London and hires a cigar-smoking manager Vivian Van Damm (perfectly played by Bob Hoskins). After serious financial losses, Mrs. Henderson decides to present a daring show - nudity on stage.

Actually it was, and had to be, a tableau because of the censors, but anyway, the film follows the stories of the people in this show business that didn't stop during the aerial blitz. Christopher Guest appears as Lord Cromer (or Tommy as Mrs. Henderson calls) who grudgingly approves of her new stage, and Kelly Reiley as Maureen as one of the stars of the show.

If you ask me about the acting, cinematography, costumes (by Sandy Powell, Oscar-nominated for this film) and musical numbers, `Mrs. Henderson Presents' deserves 5 stars or perhaps more. Judi Dench is superb as rebellious and hilarious Laura Henderson and the dialogues between her and Bob Hoskins (who is also wonderful) are always funny. When together, their characters are believable, and at times manage to realize touching moments.

Still I think the film is deeply flawed, not as a comedy, but as character-driven drama. The film gets weak in the second half, where the story becomes more melodramatic and contrived. Even those people who enjoyed this film would find the episodes about Laura Henderson, Maureen and a young solider unnecessary and incredible, compared with the love-hate relations between Henderson and Van Damm in the earlier part. Add to that, the final speech by Mrs. Henderson before the crowd in the war-time Soho does not sound authentic and moving as the film thinks even in the fictional world of comedy. I simply could not see why Laura Henderson was so eager to present nude women on stage even during the war. Yes, it is kind of her mission for the soldiers, and she explains so, but is it really?

One interesting thing is that real Laura Henderson bought the Windmill Theater in 1931, not in 1937 as the film says. Apparently the screenplay shifted the time to give stress to the film's historical aspect as war-time story, but I believe the source material could be more intriguing and amusing by emphasizing the changing relations between the theater owner and the manger more. (In the second half of the film, Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins shares the scenes less than in the first half. Why not use their talent and chemistry more?)

2469819,4,B000CQO6IY,"This is one of those films which you either love or hate. It is based on a true story.

If you'd told me before I had heard of ""Mrs Henderson Presents"", that in one of the more moving and amusing films I would see this year, the actress playing a septuagenarian widow would completely steal the show from a bevy of attractive younger women who spend much of the film without their clothes, I would have found it hard to believe but the answer can be explained in two words - Judi Dench.

Dame Judi plays Mrs Lilian Henderson: the film starts with her husband's funeral, and shortly thereafter in one of the many sad parts of the film she flies to France to visit the grave of her only son, who had been killed in the first world war aged 21. ""Bored with widowhood"" and looking for something to do, she buys the Windmill theatre and hires Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run it. Come the second world war, she decides to entertain the troops by putting on displays of naked girls.

The film is at times very sad, and at others very funny. All the acting is superb, especially from Dench, Hoskins, Christopher Guest who plays the Lord Chamberlain, Thelma Barlow as one of Mrs Henderson's friends, plus Will Young and Kelly Reilly as cast members. Some people wondered if a more extreme parody of the Lord Chamberlain by soneone like John Cleese would have been funnier: personally I thought Christopher Guest's understated embarrasment and outrage worked better than a slapstick, over-the-top peformance would have.

This film could easily have been rude, cheesy, or unsophisticated, but it was none of those things. Clearly not everyone liked it, but a lot of other people did, and I was one of them. I think it deserved the critical acclaim.",1168128000,,1742,4.609677419354838

When her husband died, a feisty British dowager named Laura Henderson bought a West End theater called The Windmill, where, for the first time ever in the history of England,  nude models appeared live on stage (the nudity could pass legal muster because it was presented strictly in the form of tableaux).  These shows quickly became all the rage in Depression Era London, and the theater even became a beacon for morale-boosting through the dark days of the Nazi Blitz. Her cohort was a producer named Vivian Van Damm, whom the flighty Mrs. Henderson took a shine to - on both a personal and professional level - early on.

Stephen Frears` ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is what is generally known in the trade as an ""actors' film,"" one in which the stars are the key to the movie's success.  And, indeed, Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins turn in flawless performances that complement one another very nicely.  Dench is all stiff-upper-lip, scenery-chewing feistiness, while Hoskins plays the part of her foil with impressive understatement.  Moreover, the film is to be commended for not going for the obvious in its portrayal of the relationship between these two very different main characters (Van Damm was married and stayed true to his wife).

The script is clever, sharp and witty, with just the right amount of sentiment thrown in to give the movie the fairy tale quality it needs to succeed.  In terms of the sets, cinematography and costume design, the film is a sumptuous, lovely-to-look-at, pitch-perfect re-creation of its time period.

When all is said and done, ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is a lighter-than-air souffle that is quickly consumed and then forgotten.  But it sure gives one a lot of pleasure while it lasts.",1161648000,,1733,4.941379310344828

Dench wants to open a nightclub/review in downtown London and secures Bob Hoskins as the one to implement her plans.  Of course the two clash and of course they she falls in love (though unadmitted, even denied). The story takes a turn when, after success and subsequent failure have occurred, the suggestion is made to have nude ladies on stage.  By a slight of hand - and with Dench's contacts in the Home Office - this is allowed on the proviso that they do not move.  But nude statues are enough to get the young men in the military packing the place.

There are many individual stories - from the death of Dench's son in WWI to the introduction of Hoskins wife (insulted by the stunned Dench) to the finding of an innocent farm girl who joins the cast. As the bombing grows the place becomes a natural shelter (it is below ground) and a home of sorts to the various people who work there. At the end, the government tries to shut them down for morals but the club prevails.  It is based on a true wartime story.  Greatly recommended - A+",1159833600,,1245,4.359307359307359

She is as always wonderful and of course won an Academy Award nomination for her role as Mrs. Henderson. The toupee-ed Bob Hoskins is quite dapper as Vivian Van Damn, playing against Ms. Dench. Will Young does some fine singing as well.

Based on a ""true incident,"" ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is all about Laura Henderson's re-opening the Windmill Theatre in London circa 1937 since she is bored with her recent position of widowhood. In order to pump up failing attendance at the theatre, she conceives the idea of having young nude women stand as statutes to complement the musical numbers. The results were out of this world with shows running continuously.

About half way through this delightful comedy, the skies darken literally as Hitler bombs London. But the show must go on. The film becomes a commentary on war.

More about Ms. Dench: as anyone who has ever seen her act knows, she can take you from laughter to tears in an instant. There is a fantastic scene near the end of this not-to-be-missed film, when she delivers a poignant speech about the death of her son in World War I and the futility of all deaths by young soldiers, regardless of whatever war, that will put a lump in your throat.

Based on a true story (or is it true events?), Mrs. Henderson fiends herself a widow (Judy Dench).  Prompted by a friend to spend money without guilt, she finds herself in possession of the Windmill Theater.  She then hires Bob Hoskins to run it for her.  The early shows are a smash but the furor dies down when the other theaters copy the Windmill.  And then Dench decides to go with naked girls in the show.

London during the war is not a place where naked girls are allowed on stage.  But Mrs. Henderson manages to appeal to the Lord Chamberlain (Christopher Guest) and the Windmill is back in business with a vengeance.  The shows are popular and the theater's underground nature makes it a safe place one the war escalates and the German bombs begin falling.  The final showdown between Mrs. Henderson, the Lord Chamberlain, and the war is unforgettable.  Here we learn what is really behind all of Mrs. Henderson's plans and schemes.

This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  I am often wary of movies billed as being based on true events as they tend to wind up so far from the truth that they might as well not say it.  But after watching the extras (including scenes with the original Windmill girls) I learned just how real this story was.  Now take this fascinating piece of history and add some of the best acting to hit the screen in some time and you have one of the few films I have felt deserving of a full five stars.

Mrs. Henderson (played by Judi Dench) hires Mr. Vivian Van Damm (played by a scowling Bob Hoskins) to run the production company.  Van Damm, an out of work theater manager, insists on total control of everything related to the business and creative side of the theater. The opening receives respectable reviews, but attendance declines.  To bolster attendance and revenues, Mrs. Henderson suggests nudity on the stage, something that ""simply isn't done here.""  This all happens within the backdrop of WWII bombings in London.

The relationship between Mrs. Henderson and Mr. Van Damm is strange, and central to the plot.  She is a non-traditional British society matron.  He is an out of work theater manager. He pushes her, her opinions, and her assistance aside every opportunity possible.  Certainly he was not the only manager available, but her tolerance for this behavior is astounding.  The movie's director portrays her as an avant-garde socialite.  This kowtowing to an employee by a rich, well-respected, politically connected, adventurous lady brings an absurdity to the plot.  The revelation that she wants young soldiers to be able to view and appreciate the female body before dying in battle?  Please!  If this was her mission in life, she should have opened a social club.

These are plot problems, not acting problems.  I was irritated by the continued grouchiness of Bob Hoskins.  And if nude women on the stage was as radical as suggested, I would have expected more press coverage, protests, and political battles (think of what was happening in the US with the temperance movement, women's suffrage, etc.).  Were the women exposing themselves considered harlots or performers?  What was British society's reaction?  And was this the culture that spawned Shakespeare and his bawdy writings?!

The gloominess of the times was well represented in the direction, and the minor characters were well cast.

Judi Dench was witty, full of spark and absolutely hilarious.  She acted like she was 10 years old - it was wonderful!  I love it when actors and actresses don't take themselves too seriously!  Judi Dench portrayed an septenarian widow that couldn't bring herself to behave in a proper manner.  After her husbands death, she purchased a theater that took London by storm.

After that glowing praise, the rest of the movie was not so impressive or enjoyable.  In the middle, when Judi Dench was less present, the movie began to drag on.  There is only so far you can take this plot, and there was little character development to carry the movie.

Surprisingly enough, the idea is the offspring of an eccentric older lady, played wonderfully by Judi Dench.  In order to keep the practices ""legal,"" Bob Hoskins portrays a director who must make the nudity artistic as opposed to some sort of strip-club environment.

One may be shocked to learn that this isn't just some male fantasy movie, but actually deals with the concept of coping with a horrifying environment on a very deep level.  Or, to put it a different way, the movie has a heart.

This is one of the most unconventional war movies you'll ever see, but it remains a war movie nevertheless.  The primary focus is on World War II, not the nudity on-stage.

Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins stole the show; both are splendid and shine with such intense brightness thanks to a ravishing direction of Stephen Frears, who made a superb portrait about the courage and bravery of England after the historical and well known unmerciful German bombardments.

Artistic direction, choreographies, designs, make ups, wardrobe and soundtrack are of first rate. So, please don't doubt just for a second at the moment to watch and acquire it.",1152576000,,923,5.019607843137255
2469856,5,B000CQO6IY,Anyone who is a fan of Judi Dench would probably enjoy this movie just for the chance to see her once again as she gives a delightful look at a woman coming into her own later in life. Bob Hoskins also turns in a very memorable peformance with a surprise reveal that I will not spoil for other viewers.  The attention to historic detail adds to the overall enjoyment and I would give this movie a very high recommendation.,1152316800,,422,4.341772151898734
2469857,4,B000CQO6IY,"Mrs. Henderson (Judi Dench) is an upper crust British woman of the 1930s, recently widowed, very wealthy, and at complete loose ends.  She has deep emotions, well hidden under a covering of good manners and frivolous comments.  On a seeming whim, in need of a ""hobby"", she buys a theatre in London's West End and hires Vivian Van Dam (Bob Hoskins) to run it.

After an initial successful run as a traditional music hall, business begins to fall off as other theatres adopt the Windmill's innovation of having continuous shows.  Mrs. Henderson then announces the next innovation:  nude women!  She negotiates with the Lord Chamberlain (Christopher Guest in a fun smaller part) for his approval, and he makes his determination:  as long as the nude women do not move, it can be permitted.  The theatre then becomes a roaring success, and then a legend as the only West End theatre to never close during the Second World War and the horrendous Blitz.

The most fun in the movie is Mrs. Henderson herself, with her combination of oddly forthright statements and obtuse upper class ways and mores.  Judi Dench seemed to be having a great time in the role and definitely deserved her Oscar nod.  Bob Hoskins, too, was wonderful in his role as the theatre impressario watching over his cast and shows with a fatherly eye, and often butting heads with Mrs. Henderson over the running of things.  As he did to Mrs. Henderson, he remains a somewhat closed off enigma to the viewers, frustrating one's curiosity but satisfying at the same time, in terms of being true to the character, a very private man. Also, the smaller roles, including Mr. Guest's and that of one of the featured nude players, allowed the actors a chance to shine as well.

Ultimately the movie is a slight one, a confection with some very grown up themes at the center (but not deeply explored) that is mostly a light enjoyment.  THe deeper things were somewhat frustratingly hinted at without definite resolution, such as Mr. Van Dam's feelings for Mrs. Henderson, or the suggestion at the end that Mrs. Henderson had intended to open a nude theatre from the very start, with a specific purpose in mind.  That left a tiny bit of disatisfaction in me at the end, but overall I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, and was reminded once again that while Dame Judi Dench is justly acclaimed in nearly everything she undertakes, Bob Hoskins is a frequently overlooked treasure who deserves far more roles, and more attention.

Definitely worth a look on DVD.",1152057600,,2511,4.751152073732719
2469858,5,B000CQO6IY,"Ever since seeing its theatrical trailer, I wanted to see ""Mrs. Henderson Presents."" It's the true story of a very well-connected and very wealthy British widow who decides to buy a West End theater in the late 1930s. That theater became the legendary Windmill, which never closed during the blitz. Unfortunately, the film had a fairly brief run in our local art house, which has poor sound quality. Luckily, DVDs provide a permanent second chance at viewing this--and other--fine films.

This film is well scripted, excellently acted, and sumptuously produced. The story is deeply satisfying and deeply moving--with enough laughter to leaven it. Indeed, it's one of the relatively few films worth a second viewing.

Dame Judi Dench, who plays Mrs. Henderson, was justly nominated for the Oscar for her performance, and Bob Hoskins (who produced the film) should have gotten such a nomination as well.",1151798400,,901,5.164383561643835

Mrs. Henderson is full of life. She has lost a son, a husband, and she is getting on in years, but she experiences both joy and sorrow to the fullest extent and is clearly intent on maximizing the former. She is out of touch with the life of the lower classes, but she is self-aware, has a good heart and loathes restrictive social norms (which she is rich enough to defy), which makes her a very likeable character. Because of Dench's performance, the radiant Mrs. Henderson's zest for life rubs off a little on the audience, too. Highly recommended :)",1150934400,,808,4.572413793103448

2469863,5,B000CQO6IY,"This movie was extremely entertaining.  It was about a widow who was bored with who she was and wanted to make a difference in her life - and entertain herself - through theater.  Mrs. Henderson was the type of woman I want to be at 70.  She was fiesty, opinionated, and a little bit naive.  She lived in her own world and had the ends and gumption to take risks, ones that she believed in.  I loved it.  She was my favorite character, though all of them were extremely well written.

The movie shows how the first theater in England that had live nude girls originated.  The Lord Chamberlain would only allow them to be displayed as art, and I did not see one scene that could be termed as offensive.  Everything was, corny as it may sound, done very tastefully (after all, Mrs. Henderson hired barbers ;o) ).

The music was authentic and extremely well done, the costumes were wonderful, the whole movie will take you back in time.  Of course, that's what it's supposed to do, but I loved every second of it.  Especially when the war started to directly affect the surrounding area.  You begin to realize that the theater is more than just a paycheck for the performers, it's  something that they believe in.

2469864,4,B000CQO6IY,"""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is a fictionalized account of London's famous Windmill Theatre in the era of its great glory, 1930s-1940s, under the leadership of owner Mrs. Laura Henderson and manager Vivian Van Damm, creators of ""Revuedeville"", the theater's non-stop musical review that featured nude tableaux vivants on stage. When wealthy Mrs. Henderson (Dame Judi Dench) finds herself thoroughly bored with widowhood, she decides to buy a old theater in London's West End. Knowing next to nothing about theater and hoping to put on a musical revue, Mrs. Henderson hires the autocratic Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run it for her. Van Damm comes up with the idea of non-stop shows, which are a great success -until other theaters follow suit. Mrs. Henderson suggests that they be more daring: Put nude women on stage. The only way the censors will permit it is if the ladies don't move -like statues or paintings. So the Windmill becomes fabulously famous and popular for its unmoving nudes among the song and dance.

The subplots in ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" are fiction. Mrs. Henderson seems to have been more eccentric in real life and her relationship with Van Damm more strained, as well. At some point in this film, the funny story about an aristocratic lady and her working class manager putting naked girls on stage takes a serious turn. London comes under attack from German bombers, and the Windmill stays open through the Blitz -which it really did. The Windmill's auditorium was underground, so it was relatively safe. Director Stephen Frears and writer Martin Sherman have taken liberties with the story and characters, but many of the tableaux vivants in the film are copied from photos of the real shows. The musical numbers were created for the film in the style of the 1930s and 1940s and had to be fully choreographed and performed. The film has a strong musical component, as we see some of the musical numbers in their entirety. The lead vocal roles are performed by Will Young and Camille O'Sullivan. ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is funny and entertaining with a glimpse into a colorful aspect of London's performing arts history.

The DVD (The Weinstein Company 2006): Bonus features include a making-of featurette, a theatrical trailer, 24 production stills and behind-the-scenes photos, and an audio commentary. ""The Making of Mrs. Henderson Presents"" (24 min) is a documentary in 5 parts featuring interviews with director Stephen Frears, the cast, producer Norma Heyman, production design, make-up and costume artists, choreographers Debbie Astell and Eleanor Fazar, as well as some of the original ""Windmill Girls"".  The audio commentary by director Stephen Frears is a sporadic discussion of the cast, sets, filming, and the musical numbers.

2469866,2,B000CQO6IY,"This film came very close to receiving a positive review, but I just couldn't pull up enough good qualities about it to render such a personal verdict. And there ARE good qualities to it.

First and foremost is that it was directed by the estimable Stephen Frears. Having fallen in love with High Fidelity and Dangerous Liaisons (both directed by Frears), I'd hoped to find a similar quality here. No dice. Although filmed relatively well, the storyline was choppy and veered away from the main character (Judi Dench as Mrs. Henderson) far too often. The focus of the film felt as though it were drifting through a fog. Personally I would've enjoyed seeing the WW II veterans' viewpoint on the new nudeness of this raucous stage. The emotional impact surely would've been greater as we see how many ""boys"" return to Mrs. Henderson's theater and how many ...don't.

The second positive for the movie is that it has Judi Dench in the prime role and Bob Hoskins (Mr. Van Damm) as her prime supporting actor. The two fed off each other extremely well and it showed how two people, who were probably in love with each other, denied their feelings for one another in a time of greater righteousness. But, even though they played well off each other, their respective rolls were lost amongst the ""out of focus"" film. Many times I felt the attention was on them when it should've been somewhere else, and vice-versa.

At 103 minutes long, the movie was short-changed. This was a pivotal moment in world history as well as in London's theater history. Compressing it so drastically really made the whole film shallow and limited. Combining theatrical nudity and the horrors of wartime should've been explored much more in-depth.

It's really a shame. I loved the history of the times and the story surrounding The Windmill Theater (Mrs. Henderson's purchase), but this flick didn't give me enough of either.",1149206400,,1898,4.8307692307692305
2469867,5,B000CQO6IY,"Mrs. Henderson (Dench) has just been 'inconvenienced' by her husband's death.  What to do now?  She's disastrous at hobbies, worse at charities.

So, she buys a theatre and hires Vivian VanDam (Hoskins) as her manager.  He's very specific:  she's not to interfere in artistic decisions.

But, interfere she will and their bickering is hilarious.

The Windmill never closes.  Unlike the other London theatres, they don't juat have a couple of shows per day.  It works, til their competition follows suit.

Then, they introduce nudity--but only static displays--if the women moved, it'd be lewd.

And the war comes.  Mrs. Henderson is her usual impractical self.  She decided not to buy a hat and donated the funds to the War Savings Trust.  She wants one of the actresses to date a young soldier gone off to the war.

Then we see the real action, the blitz and the heartbreak.  Both Mrs. Henderson and the theatre come of age during the duress of wartime.

""Mrs Henderson"" may not be a film you will want to own, but I definitely think it is one you will want to see.  Both Dench and Hoskins turn in a stellar performance and the musicals are also pretty witty.",1148947200,,1160,4.686567164179104

2469873,4,B000CQO6IY,"Even with the frivolous trailer (included here in the DVD), I was actually surprised to find just how lightweight this 2005 movie is. In fact, until the last twenty minutes or so, it is a relatively inconsequential though charming entertainment, as well as a musical treat and a visual feast of London just before and during WWII. Director Stephen Frears seems an unlikely choice to guide such a confection given his earlier credentials in grittier fare like ""The Grifters"", but he shows dexterity in handling both the farcical and sentimental elements even when it seems he cannot make up his mind whether this is a stylized recollection or a historical piece.

Based on a true story about the Windmill Theater in London's West End (which has ironically ended up as an erotica theater in the more modern sense), the story centers on newly widowed dowager Laura Henderson, who is left with a lot of money to spend and nothing that excites her until see sees a dilapidated theater. She buys and refurbishes it and then enlists theater manager Vivian Van Damm to pull together a variety revue. Copycat competitors take away the initial success at the Windmill, so Mrs. Henderson decides to add statue-like nude females. Despite the constant tit-for-tat arguments between Mrs. Henderson and Van Damm, the theater thrives and inevitably becomes a magnet for wartime servicemen. The war intercedes with the London blitz, and stuffy Lord Cromer provides what there is of a dramatic conflict by threatening to shut the theater down to minimize what he sees as unnecessary military congregations.

The title role appears custom-made for Judi Dench, who has already mastered her particular blend of imperiousness and earthiness in a number of recent roles. She certainly holds it together with ease and is ably abetted by a relatively sedate Bob Hoskins, who displays his trademark schlubby nurturing manner, as Van Damm. In a few scenes, Christopher Guest is an inspired choice to play Lord Cromer. The period look of the film is just right thanks to expert work behind the camera - Hugo Luczyc-Wyhowski's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes and Andrew Dunn's cinematography. The DVD contains Frears' lackluster and overly detailed commentary on an alternate track, as well as a solid five-chapter ""making of"" featurette that first spotlights the real Windmill girls now in their seventies and eighties. Surprisingly not included are any sepia-toned photos of the real Mrs. Henderson and Van Damm.",1146873600,,2496,5.1302211302211305
2469874,5,B000CQO6IY,"The movie Mrs. Henderson Presents depicted a romantic and heroic story behind the scenes of the Windmill Theatre in WWII. Mrs. Henderson (Judi Dench), a wealthy widow, refurbished the underground theatre and handpicked a competent Jewish manager (Bob Hoskins) to run it. Despite, or because of, their clash of styles and temperament, the couple worked superbly as a team. Each confined to one's area of expertise, though at one time Mrs. Henderson vowed not to set foot on the theatre. Mrs. Henderson used her good connections to seek the official nod to keep the theatre open. Mr. Van Demm managed everything in the theatre, from boosting the morale of the young artists, design of the numbers and setting the posture of the nude artists.

What makes the movie special is the optimistic mood it conveys amid difficult times. Despite bombing above ground, the artists, cuddled in the basement, courageously put on a show night after night while the soldiers had something to cheer about. Judi Dench makes the old, eccentric English lady sensible, charming and endearing. Behind her sweet smile and soft-spoken tone lied an adventurous spirit and her girlish dream of true love, leading to poor judgement and disastrous results at times. And the script does Mrs Henderson justice by enabling her to justify her bold and sometimes irrational decisions with her experiences. Bob Hoskins portrays a clear headed Mr. Van Demm, caring for his extended family - the young men and women in the theatre. In addition, delightful surprises came from the beautiful singing, carefully designed stage numbers and costumes. Kelly Reilly (Ms Bingley in Pride and Prejudice), is simply a stunning beauty. She pulls off a wonderful performance in the romantic subplot - a country girl who thought, and sadly rightfully so, the stage at Windmill was the only safe place for her to be.",1146355200,,1865,5.055194805194805
2469875,4,B000CQO6IY,"Those of you who can remember the 1930s, or the 1940s, or you enjoy watching the old MGM musicals on cable; should truly enjoy watching Mrs.  Henderson Presents.  The movie is based on true events, but is fictionalized somewhat because the director felt that musicals, and dramas have different rules.

The period of time, covered in the movie is from 1937 to 1943.  The place is London England.  A bored widow decides to buy a theater, and put on musical revues.  She and the theater manager in order to differentiate themselves from the other theaters in the neighborhood, decide that their show must run continuously.  It's quickly a hit, and quickly copied by every other business in the neighborhood.

To differentiate themselves again, they decide to have nude girls in their show.  This is a problem, however, because of England's decency laws.  They must get permission and a license from the Lord Chamberlain (played by Christopher Guest).  He reluctantly agrees to give Mrs.  Henderson the license but he stipulates that the girls must not move, so that he has some justification to call it art, and the lights must be low.

Therefore, Mrs.  Henderson (Judi Dench), and the theater manager (Bob Hoskins) developed a series of numbers where some of the girls must stand nude in tableaux vivants, or (living pictures), while musical numbers go on around them.  The effect is like when you played, freeze tag as a kid.  One of the windmill theaters, most popular nude models is played by, (Kelly Reilly).

The story of what happens at the windmill theater, to the millerettes, and the rest of the theater group is a good one and should have been told long before now.

Watch the opening credits, as I feel they are unique for a modern movie.  If you watch the extras on the DVD.  You can even see some of the girls who worked at the Windmill theater during the war.",1146182400,,1872,4.719135802469136

There is a great chemistry between her character and that of Van Damm. Right from the onset of this film till the end, it has a great storytelling screenplay mixed with a great sense of hearty direction.

This film has it all from subtle humor to romance to great dialogues with admireable accents and nudity which is made to look rather beautiful. I did not expect myself to like this film one bit which is probably why it had such a major impact over me.

The direction is close to being called flawless and the acting is simply as solid as they come.

Judy Dench and Bob Hoskins play one of the great ""couples"" in movie history. The Windmill Theater really existed and it really existed as portrayed in the film. If this film doesn't find a special place in your heart, I will be sadly mistaken in my assessment of it.

2469878,5,B000CQO6IY,"It has been a long, long time since I've seen a movie that truly engaged me from beginning to end, leaving me very glad I watched it.  Mrs. Henderson Presents is that movie.  I love Judi Dench, so that was really my biggest reason for renting this to begin with.  I thought she was funny, honest, and very entertaining.  The storyline is very simple: she's a widow, buys a theater because she won't do ""typical widow things"" like needlepointing, and then offers musicals where some of the girls are naked.  It was done respectfully, artistically, and believably.
  Something that jumped out at me was that there wasn't a terrible villian of any sort.  Sure, there were problems with people and so on, and the bickering between her character and Bob Hoskins was hilarious, but there wasn't some evil force out to destroy anybody.  It shows a lot, in my opinion, when you can have an entire film without a villian.
  I won't ruin it, but her speech at the end of the movie, to all of the soldiers, was moving.  It didn't make me cry, but it seemed so honest and effortless, as if Judi Dench was really saying it and not a character she was playing.  Also, there was just the right amount of joking at the end that had me go from serious to laughing in about five seconds.
  The rest of the cast was wonderful.  Bob Hoskins and all of the ladies at the Windmill...I can't say enough about how great this film was.  I will always love Judi Dench best in her Oscar-winning role as Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in Love, but this role was made for her; she's just the right amount of sophistication and realism to play an upper crust English woman in the 1930's...she's amazing.",1145923200,,1673,4.486754966887418

This movie is absolutely charming, thanks to the wonderful Judy Dench and Bob Hoskins.  Dench is always such a pleasure to watch; she simply owns the screen.  Her character is snobbish, rigid, and quite loveable.  Hoskins is the perfect match for her.  He's just as outrageously snobbish as she is, and their scenes together are the best in the movie.  There's lots of 30s and 40s music in the music hall numbers and lots of nudes.

2469880,4,B000CQO6IY,"I have always loved British comedies especially those containing/featuring a Lady Bracknell (from Oscar Wild's ""Importance of being Ernest"") type of woman.  ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" is such a comedy.  Judi Dench plays, of course, the ""Lady Bracknell"" type character and she plays her most delightfully.  I'm sure Dame Judi could play this kind of role almost blindfolded.  Fortunately for us the audience, she does not just go through the motions of playing this character.  Her Mrs. Henderson is very funny and (surprise) also very warm.  She splendidly plays a woman that, at first, seems to be just an ""upper crust"" bitty who seemly is unaware of the common-man's foibles.  Nevertheless we learn that her character has known grief (her 21 year old son died in World War One) and that she is far more aware and sensitive to a lot more than most people would think.  Dench gives a ""well seasoned"" and a great performance!  Her love interest (she is very recently widowed) and ""sparing partner"" is Vivian Van Damm, played superbly by Bob Hoskins.  It's like having two irretrievable forces butting heads.  I loved it.  The aforesaid leads are very strong and very well seasoned and they are at the height of their powers delivering wonderful performances!

The movie is a delightful and humorous story about an older well-off dowager needing more in life than just luncheon with the girls and charity work so she buys and renovates a closed theater to put on staged musicals which eventually have to include the use of some stage nudity to heighten the appeal and to draw in the masses which, of course, it does.  While ""the play/musical is the thing"" we, the audience, are never allowed to lose sight of the fact that England was at war and that London was being bombed on a regular basis.

The cinematography (with its use of vintage/archival films showing the bombing of London) is marvelous.  The good, bad and the rather ugly is shown.  The film is also filled with some terrific British Character Actors--Christopher Guest, as Lord Cromer and Will Young, are particularly good.

All in all, this film offered me a delightful and pleasant 103 minutes of viewing.  As in ""The Full Monty"" the British really know how to make the mere suggestion of someone ""taking it all off"" very funny indeed.",1145836800,,2298,4.846153846153846
2469881,4,B000CQO6IY,"Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) was a member of England's upper-most socio-economic faction. She and her husband traveled in the most elite circles. They had business throughout the English Empire and were privileged in all corners. Unfortunately, when her husband dies, Laura is left without not just the love of her life, but also the man who kept her schedule. She is forced to occupy her time some other way. She is schooled in the art of widowhood by a friend (who was played very well by Thelma Barlow). Mrs. Henderson is instructed that being a widow is not that bad, for example she has no one around to stop her from buying things. The advice, though in reference to jewelry, was applied when Mrs. Henderson bought the Windmill Theatre.

She knows nothing of running a theatre and even less about producing a review. To help her with her project, Mrs. Henderson hired Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins). Together they revolutionize the theatre experience in England, offering things that have never been available before, up to and including nude girls.

The story is based on actual events. It was certainly an interesting piece of history to recount, and it was done well. I may have been a little too young to fully appreciate the humor and the charm, but I still liked the movie a good deal.

Judi Dench's body of work will be celebrated well into the future. Her career is an impressive one, and really speaks for itself. Her role as Laura Henderson is another notch in her belt of which she should be extremely proud. If my saying so is not enough, it did earn her an Academy Award nomination.

It is hard to overshadow a Judi Dench performance, but apparently if anyone is capable it is Bob Hoskins. I may be so bold as to actually think he did a better job than she. He has been nominated for many awards, but I have seen very few of those pictures. I figured he would always be Eddie Valiant to me, the character he played in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

The movie is not well suited for a younger audience as there is nudity, though it is tastefully done. But I guess that is just a word we just to justify seeing naked people. The writing was funny and the songs were very good. I will warn you, some are not so easy to get out of your head.",1145836800,,2250,4.464720194647202

2469902,4,B000CQO6IY,"Based apparently on a true story, the film had a certain episodic quality (like a biography) rather than the building-to-a-climax-and-denouement of fiction -- like there were a series of events that took place over a decade or so from the thirties to 1943-44.  Set in England, the story begins in the thirties with a wealthy widow (Dench) returned from India who is looking for something to occupy her time.  She tries the usual things and they don't work, so she ends up buying a London theater and then hiring an out-of-work Dutch theater manager (who she keeps pointing out is Jewish)to run.  They begin with music hall theater (vaudeville), and then move on to some tasteful nudity (because in the meantime, WWII has begun and there are a lot of soldiers on leave to entertain.)  THere are some sideplots, including a grave in France and Dench's relationship with the theater manager.  Much of the film incorporates music of the period and if you like to step back in time, this is the film for you.  If you're looking for a strong plot to hold your attention, there's really not a strong plot in this movie.  But Dench is riveting, and all in all, it's good entertainment and a reminder of what life is like when you're in a city relentlessly under attack from bombers.",1145577600,,1274,4.660714285714286
2469903,4,B000CQO6IY,"The British have an affinity for making charming comedies about nudity that seems well beyond the ability of our colonial filmmakers.  They have proven this in films from ""The Full Monty"" to ""Calendar Girls,"" and in case anybody was thinking that they could only do this with overweight blokes and older ladies, along comes ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" to show that naked young women can be charming as well.  Director Stephen Frears is helped along in this endeavor in that the story he is telling is based on true events, since nudity combined with history has much more justification than simply nudity for the sake of art.

Mrs. Henderson (Judi Dench) is a widow who eases the boredom of her life by buying the Windmill, a West End theater in Soho.  She hires Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run the place and he comes up with the innovative idea of doing a non-stop revue: no need to wait for the start of a performance, just come on in, sit right down, and stay as long as you like.  The idea of ""Revudeville"" is such a big success that everybody copies it, so now Mrs. Henderson needs to present something different and she suggests nude girls.  This is Britain, so it goes without saying that would be wrong, but in chatting up Lord Cromer (Christopher Guest), the Lord Chamberlain, she establishes that while a naked woman who moves might be considered obscene, a naked woman who did not move would not.  After all, there are statues and naked women on display at the National Gallery.  Therefore, the ""Windmill Girls"" will be displayed in motionless poses as living statues.

The big moment is supposed to be when the Windmill stages its first ""tableaux vivants"" for the general public, but that turns out not to be the case.  Instead, the big moment comes when the ""English roses"" that Van Damm has collected are required to disrobe for the first time on stage during rehearsal.  This becomes a stick wicket, and the girls come up with a solution that provides the biggest laugh of the film when Mrs. Henderson arrives upon the scene and sees the best ""tableaux vivants"" of the film.  After that point the actual first performance is something of an anti-climax, and most of the rest of the film are simply vignettes about what it is was like when a mouse was let loose on stage and other on stage occurrences of note, played out against the tension between Mrs. Henderson and Van Damm when she discovers he is married and vows never to set foot in her heater again.

However, although there is not much in terms of plot for this long section of the film, the emphasis being on putting together the tableaus and musical numbers, there is a conclusion of note when World War II begins and the Windmill stays open during the Blitz.  Part of the reason is that the theater was mostly underground, so it was a relatively safe place to be during the air raids.  But there is also a sense that Mrs. Henderson is keeping her theater open to spite Hitler: after all, the Nazis have conquered France and she can no longer visit the grave of her only son, who was killed during the First World War.  There is a point where the Lord Chamberlain wants to close the Windmill, and Mrs. Henderson gets up on a crate in the middle of the street and explains in pointed and poigant terms why she puts nude women on stage.  So it was that the Windmill could proudly proclaim ""We Never Closed"" (""We Never Clothed"" is a nice play on words, but not strictly true).

Dench sails through her scenes like the great ship of state that she is, even if her dignity is challenged by such things as being placed on top of a cabinet.  After all, this is a woman who will say words that would put any gentleman to shame.  Hoskins gives his all as well (literally), and we should not be surprised that he can stand toe to toe with Dame Judi and not back down.  Special mention should be made of Will Young, who plays Bertie and sings all the tenor parts of the arrangements, and Kelly Reilly as Maureen, the tallest of the original ""Windmill Girls"" and the only one that really emerges as a distinct character.  The results are charming, which, when you stop and think about it, is really just the British version of cute.  Rated R for the tasteful exhibition of bits and pieces.",1145404800,,4256,4.513020833333333
2469904,5,B000CQO6IY,"MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS is easily one of the best films of 2005.  That it didn't garner an Oscar for Judi Dench is amazing as this is one of her finest roles (in a long line of superb films!).  Director Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons, Dirty Pretty Things, The Grifters, Liam etc) has put together a film that is at once nostalgic, sophisticated, intelligent, witty, sad, and thoroughly entertaining.  This little film is a winner.

London, 1937, and Laura Henderson, having lost her only son in WW I is discovered at the graveside of her recently departed husband.  Not wanting to be stuck with the British widow stance, she decides on a hobby to occupy her time: she buys, renovates and readies a theater in the West End of London, hires Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to be her impresario and the two successfully begin a music hall type of entertainment.  Their efforts are soon so imitated that their income falters, giving Mrs. Henderson a new concept: she will introduce full nudity into her theater to replace the French postcard surrogates the soldiers carry.  Mrs. Henderson is indefatigable, has a laceratingly funny relationship with Van Damm, and even manages to cajole the politicians to go along with her 'new concept'. By now WW II is at it s peak and despite the London blitzkriegs the theater manages to survive, but not without some sacrifices and some self-revelations between Mrs. Henderson and Van Damm.  There are many little subplots involving the company of performers, but they all blend nicely into the poignant story.

Judi Dench is absolutely radiant in this role, a role that allows her to cover a wide gamut of moods, each of which she handles expertly.  Likewise, Bob Hoskins gives the performance of his rich career and the other cast members in this ensemble piece could not be better.  The music and staged numbers are delightful and the atmosphere of London under siege is very realistic.  In every way this is a successful movie, one that deserves a wide audience and one of those DVDs worthy of placing in your film library.  A hearty Bravo! to all concerned!

2469906,3,B000CQO6IY,"A generation before Ms. Dench became a British institution another one sang ""I don't wanna spoil the party,"" but I have to -- Mrs. Henderson Presents in a middling movie that starts out as British comedy and abruptly turns into British pluck.  The upper crust Mrs. Henderson suddenly enters widowhood after her husband is ""inconsiderate"" enough to die and, looking for a way to spend the rest of her life, gives up embroidery after pricking herself with a needle and riding around London one day decides to buy an abandoned theater.  Soon she has hired Bob Hoskins to direct and stage musical revues, with continuous performances.  Business soars, then fails when other theaters mimic the form, so Dench/Hoskins decide there will be nudity in their theater.  Fortunately, the Lord Censor is Mrs. Henderson's old friend and, wheedled over lunch in the park, be gives reluctant approval so long as the nudes are motionless tableaux.  Thus ensue lots of breasts, lots of revue dance routines, and then abruptly comedy ends and we are plunged into WWII and, amidst some really fakey special effects meant to simulate the bombing of Britain, Dench and Hoskins bicker endlessly, take turns giving Churchwellian speeches, and keep their theater open throughout the war for the morale of boys going off to be slaughtered as Mrs. Henderson's only son was in WWI.

All this predictable mish-mash is mostly entertaining.  Dench has been playing headstrong, irascible with a fragile heart at least since Shakespeare in Love and every time she does she gets an Academy Award nomination.  She is a pro and a great pleasure to watch.  For his part, Hoskins unfortunately reprises much of smoldering befuddlement he directed years ago at Roger Rabbit.  Near the end there is a wonderful line about Americans.  When Dench, who cannot be seen by the outdoor crowd as she does her Churchill bit, is given a stool on which to stand, she asks the provider, ""Are you American?"" ""Yes,"" he replies.  And she mutters in her best Dench aside, ""Strange people, lovely manners.""

Anyway, in the end I'll agree that whether viewed as entertainment or serious moviemaking, Mrs. Henderson is a pretty good way to pass an evening.",1143244800,,2198,4.956403269754769

And if this performance gives us any insight into the real Laura Henderson...I want to be her when I grow up! What a spirit. She reminds me of the line from Auntie Mame ""Life a banquet and most sob's are starving to death. Live!""

2469919,5,B000CQO6IY,"WHAT A BEAUTY ! Such a film is so British that it takes quite some finesse to understand the profound humour of such a cinematographic gem. Every situation, every word, every bit of dialogue, but also every piece of this  Revudeville , every song of this Windmill Theatre, every tidbit of flesh and bosom shown on this stage becomes the best courage-builder and stamina-feeder of all kinds of audiences in the most difficult situation of all in English history, the bombing of London by Hitler in 1941. What's more this great work becomes a masterpiece because of the admirable acting of the main two characters, sorry actors, Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins. They are admirable in their grandeur because it is so lively and energetic that you finally understand what experience means in that profession : they both can develop and multiply their nuances and emotions because they have just done that for more than forty years each. And yet we feel they invent a few more in this film. Another great asset of the film is that the scenario, the dialogue is pure gold and silver and Van Damm's last word is the only possible punchline that is giving away the marvellous meaning of these six or seven years of pure theatrical and dramatic bliss for a woman and a man who are conquering the sky of posterity at the very moment when this sky is so invaded with bombers that we may or even might think there is no future whatsoever. Yes this Mrs Henderson is a  battle-axe  but this deeply felt sanguine and respectful expression of love can only be understood and appreciated in English because of more than fifteen centuries of knightly history that loom high behind the least knightlike and yet the most courageous and brave lady in that single word.

Mrs. Henderson is a very wealthy upper-class widow who says and does just about anything she wants and doesn't care what anyone thinks. On a whim, she buys an abandoned West End theatre, fixes it up, and hires theatrical producer Vivian Van Dam (Bob Hoskins) to launch a musical review. When the attendance starts to sag and they need to do something daring, Mrs. Henderson suggests ""let's get rid of the clothes"". Things become a bit more serious when the Germans start bombing London, but Mrs. Henderson insists that the show must go on. The story is unusual and engaging in its exploration of the prickly relationship between Mrs. Henderson and Van Dam, who are both intrigued and irritated by one another, but ultimately find a mutual respect. The performances of Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins are both outstanding. Mrs. Henderson is completely frivolous and shameless, as only the extremely wealthy can be, but she has some hidden depth that the story reveals touching glimpses of, and we come to see how even someone of her position is not immune from the ravages of war. When the air raids come, there is a great sequence of cuts between vintage clips of the blitz and the audience and performers at the Windmill Theatre hesitantly and then valiantly continuing a performance interrupted by bomb blasts and power flickers. London's darkest hour, and the storied spirit of the Brits in facing it, is nicely portrayed here, and shows that during such times, entertainment is not a frivolous business and may even be a vital one.

World War II comes along and this activity is revealed to be a great patriotic boon.  Young men going to war, it seems, have a right to see naked women -- and Mrs. Henderson fights for that right against stuffy bureaucrats who wish to close the theater down.  (A comparable situation in the present might be if somebody proposed that the women of NOW organize a nudie show to entertain the boys going off to Iraq.)

Technically, I suppose ""Mrs. Henderson"" is a comedy, but much of the film is dead serious -- much too serious given the premise of the plot.

I love popular culture, especially intelligent popular culture, but I have become progressively less and less enchanted each year with the summer blockbuster films that we are saddled with and the bloated, overwrought holiday films we are given each November and December.  MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS is the perfect tonic for anyone sickened by bombastic cinema, a small, lovely, and subtle film that tries to entice you with its story rather than its special effects or massive vistas.  Its ambition is to tell a small, unique period story as well as possible.  In this the film succeeds.

The film tells the story of how in 1938 a newly widowed woman (played by Dame Judi Dench), for want of anything more compelling to do after the death of her husband, buys and renovates a West End London theater, which she calls the Windmill.  Dench's performance is marvelous and I was greatly heartened to see that she was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  Mrs. Henderson hires promoter Vivian Van Damm, who persistently denies being Jewish, as artistic director and gives him unfettered control over every artistic aspect of the operation.  Bob Hoskins does his usual superb job as Van Damm (am I the only one who is under the impression that he has looked almost exactly the same for thirty years?) and much of the appeal of the film derives from the complex-combative and respectful while at the same time distantly intimate-friendship and partnership that Henderson and Van Damm form.  The initial innovation of the theater is to perform musical reviews 24 hours a day, but when other theaters begin to imitate them, their ticket sales begin to decline.  Mrs. Henderson then suggests that they trump the competition by having nude girls on stage.  Luckily she has a connection with cabinet member Lord Cromer (played surprisingly well by American comedian Christopher Guest), who although initially hesitant to OK the nudity, finally agrees on condition that the women not move, so that they resemble art works that one might find in an art museum.  The theater as a result becomes remarkably successful and continues to operate even during the worst of WW II and the Blitz.  The story revolves almost entirely around the professional relationship between Mrs. Henderson and Mr. Van Damm on the one hand and the relation of all to the girls who become the nude statues on the stage.

The cast, as in most British period films, is impeccable, though in this one also somewhat unexpected.  Will Young, the Pop Idol winner, turns in a pleasantly effective performance as the Windmill's leading musical performer, crooning the tunes with an appropriate period style.  But apart from the two main leads, the most delightful performance is by the lovely Kelly Reilly, who plays one of the girls who model on the stage.

There is a large amount of nudity in this film, but there is virtually no eroticism.  There is, in fact, less salaciousness in this film than in the vast majority of PG-13 releases.  Rita Hayworth taking off her glove in GILDA is infinitely sexier than anything that happens in this movie.  I might be willing to insist that this is the least sexy film to feature full frontal nudity (both male and female) ever made.  Only the most serious prudes would find the tiniest thing objectionable in the film

All in all, this is an utterly delightful film.  One will come away from it not thinking it one of the best films one has seen, but one will not feel sonically, visually, or intellectually abused in any way, and unlike the experience with most Hollywood movies these days, one will not feel oneself in any way insulted.  This is a small but enormously satisfying film.",1138147200,,3733,4.87797147385103

I must say that if this film had cast a less sophisticated actress than Dench, it would not have been as worthwhile watch. Dench definitely gave a better performance than her work in Ladies In Lavender, and she's funny and dramatic throughout this film. Bob Hoskins held his own opposite Dench, and it's quite a surprise to find him going full frontal in one scene! There is plenty of musical stage performances reminiscent of some old Hollywood musicals to make this film entertaining at times.

2469928,4,B000CQO6IY,"Last year's cinematic celebration of the London theatre scene was BEING JULIA, in which Annette Bening plays a no-longer-young stage actress of the late 1930s, who has hitherto starred in the productions her theatre-owner husband stages, and who crafts a delicious revenge against a fresh-faced protege whom her spouse hires and falls in love with.

Based more on actual events, and also set in the late 1930s/early 40s, MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS has wealthy Laura Henderson (Judi Dench), on the death of her husband, purchasing and renovating a derelict cinema and renaming it The Windmill Theatre for want of anything more interesting to do in 1937. To manage the establishment from the outset, she hires strong-willed Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins), who insists on having final say on their stage performances' artistic content and the day-to-day running of the place. He begins by presenting an around-the-clock vaudeville show, the 24/7 nature of which is a groundbreaking concept. This keeps The Windmill the talk-of -the-town for awhile, i.e. until other London theatres begin to imitate, and then ticket sales fall off. To regain the advantage, Laura has the idea of putting naked actresses on-stage, but then must convince the dubious Van Damm and outmaneuver the absolute veto power of the censorous city authorities, here personified by Laura's friend, Lord Cromer (Christopher Guest).

The creators of MRS. HENDERSON PESENTS have taken timeline liberties. The real Mrs. Henderson actually acquired The Windmill site in 1931, opening first with a live play, ""Inquest"", which proved unsuccessful. After briefly returning to screening films, a new manager, Van Damm, produced and opened the non-stop ""Revuedeville"" in 1932. From then on, The Windmill entered history (""We never closed"") as the only London theatre to stay open throughout the war, including the Blitz.

Dench steals the show as the meddling owner, and Hoskins holds his own as her nemesis-manager. The film deftly captures their stormy, but oddly affectionate, relationship, as well as the perils of staging performances while German bombs fell. Kelly Reilly is delightful and gorgeous as Maureen, the first showgirl recruited by Hoskins for The Windmill's bill of nudie cuties.

Towards the film's end, Laura poignantly reveals why she had the idea for removing the actresses clothes. Knowing that, and seeing the reason why she made frequent pre-war visits to France, it's particularly sad when the film ends before the Allied victory and the final credits reveal that Henderson died in 1944. She left The Windmill to Vivian, who ran it until his death in 1960. Van Damm's daughter then operated the establishment until 1964, when it was unable to compete with the strip joints. Since then, the site has hosted a cinema, a casino, a nude-review theatre, and (presently) a lap-dancing club.

MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS is a thoroughly charming and unpretentious film about a little piece of London theatre history. It probably won't make it out of the art houses, but see it if you can.",1133049600,,3056,5.228571428571429

8100495,5,B000CQO6IY,"It is between world wars in London. Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) is recently widowed. Now she must look for something to do with her time and money. Having exhausted all the conventional outlets, she ventures in to the world of theater. She purchased the dilapidated ""Windmill"" theater. To make a go of it she employs the well know Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run things. Vivian demands a free hand and is many time at odds with Laura. To save the faltering enterprise they come up with a nude tableau presentation.

Mrs. Henderson is overbearing and not as much a bigot as snot. Early on she accuses Van Damm of being Jewish. To playact his entourage he is forced to disrobe. When Mr. Henderson walks in and takes a long look ""You really are Jewish"".

The film is loosely based on real events yet adjusted for today's audience. You will notice many of the standard scenarios and clichs with a touch of ""chorus line"" or maybe 42 nd street. The real value is not just the fine acting but their personal interaction of the characters as the all learn (usually too late) more of each other as time goes by. As facades are stripped away, there is a lot more depth of character than meets the eye.",1506384000,,1197,4.486238532110092
