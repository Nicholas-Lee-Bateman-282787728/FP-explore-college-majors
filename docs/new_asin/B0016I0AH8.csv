3156396,5,B0016I0AH8,A perfect series on blu-ray. It looks amazing and it is very interesting to learn about such a beautiful country !!!,1218412800,,116,4.571428571428571
3156397,5,B0016I0AH8,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer that said: ""It also focuses on the little known and long-standing efforts by China to preserve it's environment, delicate ecological systems and unique animal life."" There's an example, in almost every episode, of conservation by the Chinese people, and this is not new. One of my favorites is the scene of Chinese people riding some distances on their bicycles with their birdcages strapped behind them, so they could hang all the little cages on trees so the birds could all talk to each other and not be lonely. Just recently, in the big earthquake (not this morning's, the one before) one of China's famous Giant Pandas 'Mau Mau' died when a wall collapsed on her. The keepers cried at her grave and she had a real funeral. While there is nothing quite so dramatic in this series, it is nice to see this side of the Chinese people at least alluded to.

Not mentioned in the last few reviews is the wonderful narration provided by Bernard Hill (captain of 'The Titanic'; King Theoden of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings'). I was happy to see his wonderful voice put to such good use, and he even gets to keep his British accent!",1217894400,69,1180,4.592417061611374

3156399,5,B0016I0AH8,"This is one of the best documentaries about China today.  It shows the diverse topography, flora, and fauna of the most geographically and ethnically diverse countries in the world. It also focuses on the little known and long-standing efforts by China to preserve it's environment, delicate ecological systems and unique animal life.  The photography is breathtaking and the extra effort to show rarely seen areas of China are amazing.  I have traveled all over China and this documentary shows the land as it truly is.  For people who would like a glimpse into this remarkable land and it's people, this documentary is an excellent choice.",1217721600,105,641,5.076190476190476
3156400,3,B0016I0AH8,"July 16th, 2008:
This series has just recently been shown on CBC in HD here in Canada. I only watched 2 of the 7 part series due to schedule conflict. What can I say, BBC has done it again after their masterpiece Planet Earth. It portraits the natural beauty, the special animal species, and the people who live in harmonization, in various parts of China. Some of the scenes, according to the narrative, are the first time being shot. From the 2 episodes I watched, Wild China has some of the most stunning images and the picture quality is superb. I was so thrilled to see most of the things I have never seen either in person or on TV/Moive, even though I was originally from that country.
Now I am going to buy it off Amazon and will put it along side of Planet Earth as my permanent collection.

September 13th. 2008:
Regrettably, I have to agree with some of the reviewers that the Blu-ray production is a letdown! Comparing to the original TV series I saw, the color is not as vivid, the image drifts in and out of focus leaving one wonders whether it is really HD. And the voice of narrative is boring, I like the CBC version much better with Canadian TV host/environmentalist David Suzuki. It is very disappointing that such an amazing HD program came out to blu-ray like this.

I therefore downgraded my original rating from 5 to 3.",1216166400,55,1342,4.451219512195122

3156409,2,B0016I0AH8,"I bought the Multi-Format blu-ray (August 5, 2008), for $8.99.  I watched Chapters 1-3 of Episode 1 (""Heart of the Dragon"").  Somewhere in the middle of Chapter 4 (after the cormorants and the dragonfly nymphs), it stopped playing.  I just spent one hour trying to ""make it work"", I gave up; I cannot watch at all the end of Chapter 4, nor Chapters 5 and 6 of Episode 1.

Episodes 2 and 3 played normally; I still can't watch the end of Chapter 4, nor the beginning of Chapter 5 (it skips to a later part).  Chapter 6 seems to be for the credits (judging from the disc Menu; I can't watch that chapter either).  Tomorrow I will watch the second disc.

3156411,3,B0016I0AH8,"I am torn between three stars and four stars.  The reason I assign three stars is hat this documentary is less about ""Wild China"" than about how humans lives in China and their impact on nature. If you are expecting a series along the lines of something produced by PBS's Nature, or the Planet Earth or Blue Planet productions of the BBC , you will likely be a bit disappointed. Still, I enjoyed it and found it very interesting.  I would classify this documentary under ""Human Geography""",1498089600,2,488,4.597701149425287

3156418,5,B0016I0AH8,"Excellent documentary!  I learned so much!  I loved the information about how humans interact with nature, and the contrast that exists between wild China and industrialized China. Although the human overpopulation there is a grim situation, knowing that there are still pristine areas of the natural world being preserved on our planet was encouraging!  We didn't want the series to end.

By the way, we loved the common ""gimmick"" of the director or cinematographer to surprise the viewer when first introducing a subject, by showing it only in part at first or from a limited viewpoint before revealing the whole. This approach was often taken in scenes introducing camouflaged animals or initial limited viewpoints of grand landscapes. Who knew that bamboo could camouflage pandas so well?!  Very entertaining!

And actor Bernard Hill's narrating always hits the mark. His delivery is never boring nor overdramatic. Very balanced.

I'll be looking for other documentaries like this from the BBC. While Sir David Attenborough has given us many a gem, productions like this one affirms that the BBC continues to be THE go-to source for excellent documentaries!",1491868800,,1161,5.2771739130434785

Given unprecedented access to the vast country, the renowned BBC Natural History Unit has produced a series full of breath-taking footage and amazing discoveries.

From the glittering peaks of the Himalayas to the teeming waters of the South China Sea. China encompasses a dazzling range of landscapes. The peaks, rainforests, deserts and caves of this vast and enigmatic country are home to a diverse array of wildlife ranging from giant pandas, tigers and golden snub-nosed monkeys to wild swans, whales sharks and beautiful tropical flowers.

As we travel through the deepest river-gorge in the world, watch fishermen using captive cormorants to gather fish and discover the remarkable Pallas' pip vipers that pluck birds from the air. It is clear, that, this amazing country is ready to reveal the most incredible wildlife surprises. Narrated by Bernard Hill.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 'Wild China' opens with subtle grace. In its first episode, ""Heart of the Dragon,"" the series travels to the rice paddies of South China and reveals some of the oldest known man-made structures in the world. From there, we get to see harvesting rituals in Guizhou, a community living in caves near Zhongdong, and traditional fisherman practicing their craft on the Li River. Along the way, a variety of birds, endangered primates, turtles, and other wildlife capture the crew's imagination and attention. ""Shangri-La"" moves to the base of the Himalayas and the Nujiang River. After documenting the lush plant life of the region, the second episode moves on to the snowy stretches of Kawakarpo, the diverse ecosystem of the Gaoligong Mountains, and the many cultures that inhabit the surrounding Yunnan province. Not only do elephants, jungle mammals, small apes, and other creatures make prominent appearances, but the NHU begins to look at the ever-intrusive presence of China's expanding cities.

Carefully sidestepping the more controversial elements of its political struggles, ""Tibet"" focuses on the Qingzang Plateau, the Buddhists who call it home, and the intriguing religious practices that influence everything in the region. More interestingly, the climate changes dramatically over the course of a few miles, leaving a variety of species to live side-by-side with humans. Moving across the Plateau, the crew devotes coverage to yaks, foxes, bears, and snakes, as well as the hot springs, freezing deserts, and vast hillsides of the area. ""Beyond the Great Wall"" heads north to the regions situated around... you guessed it... the Great Wall of China. More than a dry investigation into the construction and purpose of the Wall, this episode turns its eye to the ice fisherman of Manchuria, Mongolian horsemen who call miles of grassland home, and the shifting sands of the Taklimakan Desert. It also follows herds of reindeer, rare gazelle, wild horses, and trained eagles used for hunting.

As the series draws to a close, ""Land of the Panda"" turns to the Mandarin-speaking peoples of Central China. This episode delves into the tenuous relationship between man and beast, as well as civilization and the natural kingdom. It not only dedicates time to China's economy and political history, it weaves in tales of nearly-extinct alligators, revered animals in Beijing, and the pandas and endangered animals of the Qinling Mountains. Finally, ""Tides of Change"" traces China's coast, stopping along the way to spend time with migrating birds, jellyfish, crabs, and white dolphins. It even gives a glimpse into the lives of fisherman, oyster harvesters, and island dwellers. While it doesn't offer enough thematic closure to the series as a whole, it nevertheless does its job as another engaging episode.

`Wild China' is a stunning gorgeous and awesome documentary packed to the brim with remarkable cultures, captivating factoids, and totally awesome stunning breath-taking photography. While the series gives a thorough and extensive overview of China's people, animals, and societies, it doesn't dig into its more controversial political decisions, economic issues, human rights violations, or relations with other nations. Each episode has brief glimpses into each, but the production isn't willing to cross its established line and take its investigation any deeper. As a result, this particular visit to China occasionally comes across like a tourist video rather than a scrupulous study of the sprawling nation. Granted, these elements are hardly to the point and I wouldn't expect the BBC Natural History Unit to devote much time to them.

`Wild China' accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and gives a revealing glimpse into the far corners of the country. Once again, I have no idea how the BBC Natural History managed to capture some of the imagery that fills the documentary and, once again, I was bowled over by the riches and wonders of another culture. In my humble opinion, anyone with the faintest interest in China or the Asian mainland should give this documentary a spin. It may take a while to soak it all in, but the experience is well worth the investment.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The BBC have achieved another beautiful high definition production on this Blu-ray, and their documentary work never ceases to amaze the viewer. Going to great lengths to capture rare moments on film, the perseverance of the filmmakers and camera crew pays off in a grand fashion on this series. Encoded in 1080i, the focus on detail is apparent throughout the production. My favourite shot technique, used frequently in `Wild China' and several other BBC Natural History Unit productions, is an ultra-close-up that focuses the viewer on the colours, textures, and inherent beauty of the subjects, be they natural or artificial in origin. Although the picture is interlaced, it still contains a clarity that is hard to believe, given the filming access difficulty for much of the content. Aside from the slight softness lent by the interlaced picture, there is a small amount of colour banding noticeable here and there. Not surprising, given the high amount of rich, saturated colours that are present. Black levels are deep and satisfying, and never bloom and remain clear and intense. Texture is picked up beautifully, whether in long shots or the aforementioned ultra-close-ups. In short, `Wild China' boasts a superb, trademark BBC picture quality on this Blu-ray presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `Wild China' is impressive visual presentation is aided by a single 5.1 Dolby Digital track, which is more or less the standard for BBC high definition releases. It is a satisfactory offering that informs and mesmerises the. Ambiance is present for wildlife sequences, and likewise that of rural or nomadic human communities, but it's somewhat difficult to distinguish in the rears. Bernard Hill's rich, somewhat impassive narration, is kept to the centre channel, and is always clear. As an aside, his pronunciation of the many Chinese location names and titles is impressively spoken, flowing effortless from his tongue and causing the curious to reach for the English subtitle option. The score in the series is beautifully composed, taking its place in the ranks of nicely-done music for the BBC's documentary subjects. Never too brazen or pervasive, the strings-heavy pieces float along with each episode. It is a shame that the score isn't allowed to break beyond the confines of its compressed Dolby Digital mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Hunting Dragons  The Making of Wild China [2008] [1080p] This is the only extra feature on this Blu-ray release; a standard definition venture that runs about 27 minutes. In it, the challenge of obtaining some of the breath-taking shots in the series are explored, such as running a camera down a zip-line over a roaring river. Other difficulties are also discussed at length, such as traveling to remote locations via roughly-lain roads, or by camelback. One instance found the filmmakers at the bottom of a gorge after two days' worth of hiking, only to discover the camera broken after their descent. Language barriers were also, understandably, an issue. Clearly, everyone involved in the production of Wild China is extremely passionate about their work. Although `Hunting Dragons' may not be the most in-depth look at the filming process of the series, it is sufficient in showing the hardships endured to create it.

Finally, `Wild China' is another example of the brilliant professional work that BBC's Natural History Unit achieves almost effortlessly. The sheer amount of detail and carefully composed shots demonstrates a real appreciation for aesthetics and a stringently high level of production values. The results are superb examples of what can be achieved with the documentary format - educational material that is equally entertaining and awe-inspiring. China enjoys an odd dichotomy of sorts within the international community; it is so ubiquitous through its exports, and so geographically expansive, yet it is all the same so enigmatic and so closed to the world outside. This BBC Natural History production helps to open eyes to the beauty and ancient legacy of the country, and it looks stunning in high definition. It is not difficult to recommend this as a well-produced content and as a very nice Blu-ray package and I originally saw this on BBC Two in the United Kingdom and was totally bowled over by the stunning presentation at the time of the broadcast and this Blu-ray disc brings the images even more in an awesome experience and it knocked my socks off and it has now gone pride of place in my ever expanding BBC EARTH Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

The Chinese are tremendously conscience of their land and wildlife. I was astounded watching this and learning about the ways they farm on hillsides and how they treat their wildlife as sacred. The has a lot to do with their religion which is primarily Buddhism, something I didn't realize til watching this show. The scenery is spectacular and the respect the people have for their land is something we, as Americans could take a lesson from.

3156589,5,B0016I0AH8,Had no idea how diverse a country China is.  The people are very adept at doing so well with what little some of them have.  The geography of this country is amazing!  This program is definitely worth watching!,1397347200,,210,4.473684210526316

This was very thoughtfully put together, and gives a pretty comprehensive overview of a huge country. You see much more of the country, as you might imagine, and less of urban China. It explains a lot about their culture, and you get a strong sense that the people and its leaders are big on conservation efforts.  They have beautiful resources and are intent on preserving them.",1397088000,,481,5.075949367088608

3156596,5,B0016I0AH8,"After all the stories of China's environmental issues, this documentary series is a refreshingly alternate take. It does briefly mention the struggles of modern day China with its environment but the focus on what natural beauty still remains largely untouched in China is encouraging. Visually spectacular, it also shows that Chinese culture has always been deeply linked to its natural environment. Optimistic in tone, this is for those interested in China beyond the 'urban' or 'super fast infrastructure development' stories.",1396137600,,529,5.625

3156608,5,B0016I0AH8,"This series is beautiful. It is full of wondrous flora and fauna. Some of the animals are just gorgeous to look at and the scenery is breath taking.

Never knew how amazing the wild life and country side of China is. All you see on the news is how their cities have domes of impenetrable polluted air that you need to cut with a knife to go through it.

Unfortunately a lot of the wild life is endangered which is an all too sad consequence of human need for never ending abuse of the environment. Consequently, this series could be the last place you might ever see some of the depicted life.

The cover shows one of the fishermen who use trained birds to FISH.... another amazing testimonial to the wonders of China and the Chinese.

Entertainingly educational....Loved it.",1393632000,,775,4.553956834532374

I am transported and enlivened and enraptured watching these films.  Expansive and beautiful scenery, each one a story unfolding--stunning, awe-inspiring, and difficult at times.

Without any political and negative comments, this production takes the audience to the deepest and some very difficult areas up and down the nation... Most of the locations are breathtaking and beautiful not to mention the time and patience the crews had encountered to get some exceptional shots of the wildlife in China! Thanks so much BBC for making this enjoyable and memorable film!
I absolutely recommend it to anyone who are interested in Wildlife and the Beautiful China!!!",1392508800,5,625,5.067961165048544
3156616,2,B0016I0AH8,"Why not three stars? This excellent quality video seems to be largely in the pocket of the Chinese government. Even the cover is suggestive. ""Wild China""? Ironic then that the bird-feeding scene is contrived, and that the natives now only fish that way for tourism.

The 3D effect version on the same disk is spectacular. Simple blue/red glasses work. Moving your head around produces depth you didn't even suspect was there. The color is lousy, of course, but the 3D is amazing.

The commentary is sparse and puerile. Example, ""A natural vault of rock keeps out the rain."" Duh. (The camera is looking 100s of feet out to a cave entrance.) Then, a picture of cows. ""These could be the only cave dwelling cows on Earth."" Or ... then again ... maybe they aren't. In any case, of what possible importance is their stable?

I particularly don't appreciate paying for a DVD, then having three minutes of BBC commercials, before I can select a menu. I paid, that's it. The DVD package doesn't say anything about dumb promotional material that must be watched every time. It's a sad commentary that our marketing departments today feel they have a right to advertise whenever they can get away with it. Even on the BBC.",1392422400,,1212,4.7075471698113205

The Producer, Director, team of photographers, editors and entire crew did an exceptional job of showing how breathtaking China is as I watched each episode. This is a British Production and I hope an award was giving for their work on this film. Check out YouTube  to see quick reels of how the show was filmed. You will be surprised at the work and effort it took to film the show. Great job!",1386374400,,522,4.542553191489362

Not only for content and video quality, but mainly for the absolutely stunning camera work.  The very first episode shows that well.  There is a night time sequence of a very high speed camera recording a bat fishing in the dark that just has to be seen to be believed.  It is the best such a camera sequence I have ever seen!
The series is most highly recommended, and this from a very picky viewer who demands state of the art video quality and superior writing and camera work.  I am often disappointed by what I see on video.  I am thrilled by what I see on this one.",1385164800,,680,4.1923076923076925

There is almost nothing on the large cities in China that most of us know something about.  This series deals with remoter areas of the country, environmental efforts by the government and the people, and a four-seasons look at the areas we visit.  There is information on the Three Gorges Project, but that is about the only topic that would have some familiarity to most people.

The focus on wildlife and nature is absolutely original for China, whose well deserved industrial achievements usually take central stage in any report about the country.
Wild China is an invaluable resource for the education of youth as well as for inquisitive mature people who lack the means or the stamina to undertake  expeditions such as that required for this production.

3156738,5,B0016I0AH8,"This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen and it is no joke. It truly is an ambitious endeavor of covering so much information for so many remote and diverse regions and climates of China. It allows the viewer a look into a frontier that is rarely viewed and gives the feeling of dreaming of exploring these lands.

Picture:
The HD resolution of the images captured from the different creatures, peoples, and regions are astounding. They took a truly cinematic approach when creating the wonderful story of Wild China. There are several instances where I wonder ""HOW DID THEY DO THAT"" with some of the shots, such as wild animals atop of thick snow encrusted areas where the air is dangerously thin, or the tremendous time lapses showing the beauty of the deep canyons or fauna. One particular scene was with wild Panda going through a fight and a mating ritual all with closeness and being the first to ever capture said event on film (they are writing history).

The sheer scope of what has been covered in the series is truly astounding and gives me the desire to watch it over and over again (and I have done just that).

Sound:
This is another area that separates this from other documentaries, the film score with all the reprises and subtleties is absolutely an emotionally lifting event. It truly marries the sound with picture.

The sound (effects / voice over) are well channeled allowing you to hear so much depth, and there are hundreds of instances where you can only wonder ""HOW DID THEY DO THAT"" with their audio captures. There are circumstances where the camera is clearly extremely far from the subject as to not give away location, but the audio never fails to be crystal clear, allowing the user to truly dive deep into the atmosphere.

In comparison, I have seen and own Planet Earth on blu-ray and I can say hands down that this is better, I'm not sure if it's the fact that this continuously focused on the relationship between Man and Earth and Man and Animal always showing the impact of man, but I truly fell in love with it.

If you love documentaries, animals, or just want to go explore a new place then this is the perfect series for you, I have not been disappointed and have only watched it more and more learning new things each time. It is seamless, well shot, and ground breaking and for this I give it 5 out of 5.",1353801600,,2366,4.542253521126761
3156739,2,B0016I0AH8,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this series. There was very little ""wild"" in the content. Most of the sections were about the people of China, with an occasional animal--or two--thrown in with what can only be described as inadequate information on them. For example (spoiler alert), the episode on Tibet is mostly about the spiritual beliefs and practices of the region. The Tibetan bear did appear--which I thought was going to be very interesting since I'd never seen one before--but only briefly. He is taped looking over a hill and then running away. There is very little wildlife at all in most of the episodes so I'm a little dismayed that ""wild"" is part of the title. The Siberian tiger is seen, but in captivity. The Chinese crocodile is also shown, but in a breeding centre. There is one section that shows the mating of wild pandas (the only time this has been caught on film), but the majority of video elsewhere about pandas is in a breeding centre. Unfortunately, most of the scenes in all the episodes are about Chinese people, and how they live in different areas of the country. That to me is not about nature, which this series purports to be.

Bernard Hill has a lovely voice, but his script doesn't have much in the way of content. Much of it is repetitive. (In one episode he mentions how the Chinese government established conservation laws--in three separate parts of the same episode.)

I can't give this documentary a good rating. The packaging is beautiful, but the material in the series isn't what it suggests, and what there is in it is limited and poorly presented.",1349654400,12,1604,4.6643109540636045

3156741,5,B0016I0AH8,"Excellent and eye-opening presentations of China. As always, BBC documentary teams painstakingly captured the vase and diverse landscape of this nation and helped viewers to understand how great peaks of Tibetan mountains are feeding water to half the world's population. It also demonstrated the black side of China's exploitation of natural resouces and yet many white sides of her conservations of wildlife and environment.

Episodes immerse the viewer, causing one to wonder what is more to be shown or discovered. Some footages were filmed for the first time.

I am surprised on the ecosystems and animals that China is able to support and still exist.

I only saw one obvious seen of some flowers out of focus for a short moment, or may be focus on something else. Overall, picture quality is excellent. The background music is not overpowering, and the voice is lively and easy to understand.

Although the videos were filmed before the 2008 Olympics, much of the scenes, discoveries, conservaton efforts, wildlife, different groups of people and their ways of life, remain new and informative to people who want to know more about the region.

Children in a classroom, fishermen working the waters in bamboo rafts, and Tibetan monks meditating.

I have always been captivated by China's Great Wall, and this documentary does not disappoint!  Although no 2 blu-ray disc set can fully capture such a massive country in its entirety, Wild China certainly touches enough on the peoples, landscapes, flora and fauna to leave you satiated.

The HD  video quality is certainly not as crisp as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galapagos/dp/B000T28PWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galapagos</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>.  However, Wild China's video is good quality HD (I looked at this blu-ray on a 55 inch and had no issues other than some 'softness' in the video).

The narration is done by by 'new kid on the block' Bernard Hill (actor King Th&eacute;oden in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy).  Although I have grown accustomed to David Attenborough's narration (Life and Planet Earth), I must admit - Bernard Hill does a great job, giving&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-China-s/dp/B0016I0AI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild China's</a>&nbsp;narration a truly Royal treatment! :))

3156796,5,B0016I0AH8,"I can't say enough about this documentary. The animals, the people, the scenery are all portrayed in a balance and fairness that I've only seen from BBC. The film does not dwell too much on China's environmental problems, but also does not gloss over these. Instead, this film primarily seeks to preserve the incredible and unique beauty that can still be found in China.

Some of the shots that were captured are extraordinarily rare, and in some cases, this crew was the first to film (I will not spoil which; these are revealed). Suffice to say, we were wowed by the Blu-Ray quality: the depth of picture, the richness of the color, and the detail afforded to this nearly-lossless format (you can see individual strands of a spider's web, droplets of rain, blades of grass, reflections in animals' eyes...)

If you are at all interested in China, animals, people, or landscapes (or all of these, like I am), do not hesitate, do not pass Go... buy this documentary! There is no way you will be disappointed.

Viewing tip: Watch them all in order, then watch the ""making of"" special feature on Disc 2 to appreciate some of the more difficult shots.

The episode ""beyond the great wall"" is breathtaking (no excuse for this old cliche)...a tropical rainforest/jungle in China?
Seeing these programmes make us want to go there....and with 3 episodes to view we'll have new experiences...next is a programme on Pandas...seeing these animals up close and personal (and in the wild) via blu-ray is going to be a most gratifying experience.
Indonesia is a little behind when it comes to High Definition Television.....no terrestrial or cable HD providers so we have to ""order in"" and thank goodness fo Amazon.com....having this excellennt series and being able to see it anytime we want is even better than having to rely on a so far non-existent HD provider.

Gorgeous scenery, fascinating nature documentary, equally fascinating depictions of the highly diverse Chinese culture, with a beautiful musical score consisting of a soothing blend of traditional Chinese music and compatible western adaptations. This is not just a nature documentary.  It also discusses in some depth the evolving relationships between the Chinese, their environment and the creatures that coexist with them. I will probably remember the scenes of Chinese cultural life depicted in this series long after I've forgotten the footage of the wild critters of their land. This was a real eye-opener for someone whose main experiences of the Chinese unfortunately occur mostly in local restaurants.  A must see.

3156800,5,B0016I0AH8,"All of us in the UK give the BBC a hard time for churning our rubbish at our expense and then something comes along and you say: ""all is forgiven!"" This is a fine example of the greatness of the BBC. A poet wrote (I can't remember who): ""the beauty of the world has made me sad, a beauty that will pass"" or something to that effect. Now I don't go along with the tone of the poem which is depressive, I can understand though the poet's being moved by the grandeur of nature. And this is precisely what happened to me watching this wonderful programme - a sense of how awesome nature is and how awesome man is who is shown in this series to blend with nature and harness its powers. I was particularly struck by the fisherman with their captive comorants who had been trained to work alongside the fishermen essentially to do their fishing for them. And, the landscapes and the extraordinary monkies etc - wonderful.

One slightly negative point and that it is obvious that to obtain chinese approval a certain degree of compromise was necessary - thus in the Tibet programme we are simply told that Tibet has been part of China for 50 years i.e. there is no mention that it was annexed. Anyway, this is a small quibble.

3156836,5,B0016I0AH8,"This is not just about nature but China and its relationship, no, its dependence and links with nature.  Sometimes there is a balance and sometimes not.  For example, the people of China seem willing to eat anything, rare or not, and many animals from around the world are endangered because of this need to feed.  Yet they also respect the land, the rivers and many of the animals, which they see are bringing them good luck.  That is why I have a mixed feeling when watching the DVDs on Wild China.  So much is being done to save some animals and plants, yet others seem doomed.  China is trying but, let us face facts, they have millions of people to feed and support.  Can nature survive in China?  Should the outside world help before we lose some of the greatest treasures of the natural world?  Should they help nature while letting their own people suffer? 300 minutes and a making of feature to boot.

To say this DVD exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I was amazed at the cinematography and choice of locations. There was so much variety and beauty. I learned more about this fantastic country's topography AND it dispelled a few of my negative opinions of their pollution, land destruction and neglect of its fauna and flora. I was so impressed that conservation is at the peasant level upward for several species. I re-watched several episodes just for the sheer pleasure of this eye candy experience. Although it is a lengthy documentary, it left me desiring more. I'd always thought I would like to visit China and stick to the usual tourist attractions that several of my friends have visited and my timeshare offers. Now that I've been exposed to the various landscapes that cover such a vast area, I realize I will really need to plan well and of course spend more vacation time than I tentatively planned. Surely viewing this DVD will lend a more tolerant understanding and appreciation of China's people, culture, and natural resources (note I omitted politics).

I take away 1 star, because of the choice of narrator.  Bernard Hill, speaks wonderful English, but struggles pronouncing the many Chinese locations, provinces and towns.  It would have been absolutely wonderful if BBC had chosen a narrator that could articulate the proper Chinese pronunciations.  Just as they had for Ganges with Sudha Bhuchar.

3156862,4,B0016I0AH8,"This is another outstanding British series with excellent production values and plenty for everyone.  The makers clearly took full advantage of the pre-Olympic mandated official Chinese tolerance of western journalists, and traveled the length and breadth of the country to document its seldom-seen wildlife.  The results are stunning.  Each episode covers a geographical area and the focus is largely on photogenic megafauna, but there is so much that is new that this is an acceptable gloss.

What is less acceptable is the narration, which avoids all issues that might be even vaguely contentious.  Again and again individual Chinese efforts at conservation are praised, vignettes are tenderly shown, and the almost soporiphic narration sooths us from one gentle scene to another.  Of course a wildlife series is no place for political commentary, but a little more might reasonably have been said about why such conservation is necessary, and whether it can possibly have efficacy in the face of overwhelming forces to the contrary.  Additionally it would have been nice to have had narration with a greater emphasis on detail: the habits of the animals shown are not explored in any real depth.  This series is more in the pattern of National Geographic programs whereby pretty pictures are presumed enough and information is regarded as a potential threat to viewing figures.  Again and again as we watched the episodes, members of my family would comment that the narrator wasn't really telling us anything.  At one point my daughter said, ""I wish they'd asked David Attenborough to do this series.""

Perhaps we live in an age where information-lite is transforming to information-free; an age in which spectacular photography is considered sufficient unto itself.  If so, we can expect more series of this type: beautifully filmed, captivatingly framed, but ultimately unsatisfying because they tell us so very little about the creatures being presented and about the underlying dynamics of the environments in which they exist.",1225238400,7,2036,5.308411214953271

With sharp focusing it would have been 5 stars, no doubt. I don't think it is the 1080i or p - its plain bad photography work, I would guess. The subtitles stick out from the blurry picture and also the animations in the chapter beginnings are fine and sharp. So its not encoding.
The cameramen either used some low end HD cams or they were not on the top of their job. Some scenes look nice - but most of them not. What a waste of time on a great subject, then the end result is...hmm... compromised, to be modest.

The photography in this series is just stunning, similar to BBC's Planet Earth. Also I like the way they document the interaction between people and landscape and wildlife. I think this is the most important aspect of conservation in China today - how to achieve the balance between progress and conservation.

Many of the locations in this documentary I have not heard of before. Also many of the wildlife species are very rare and the footage is extremely available to the public.

Thank the BBC team for their great effort to present China's wildlife and natural beauty so beautifully.

3390894,5,B0016I0AH8,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer that said: ""It also focuses on the little known and long-standing efforts by China to preserve it's environment, delicate ecological systems and unique animal life."" There's an example, in almost every episode, of conservation by the Chinese people, and this is not new. One of my favorites is the scene of Chinese people riding some distances on their bicycles with their birdcages strapped behind them, so they could hang all the little cages on trees so the birds could all talk to each other and not be lonely. Just recently, in the big earthquake (not this morning's, the one before) one of China's famous Giant Pandas 'Mau Mau' died when a wall collapsed on her. The keepers cried at her grave and she had a real funeral. While there is nothing quite so dramatic in this series, it is nice to see this side of the Chinese people at least alluded to.

Not mentioned in the last few reviews is the wonderful narration provided by Bernard Hill (captain of 'The Titanic'; King Theoden of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings').

This series has just recently been shown on CBC in HD here in Canada. I only watched 2 of the 7 part series due to schedule conflict. What can I say, BBC has done it again after their masterpiece Planet Earth. It portraits the natural beauty, the special animal species, and the people who live in harmonization, in various parts of China. Some of the scenes, according to the narrative, are the first time being shot. From the 2 episodes I watched, Wild China has some of the most stunning images and the picture quality is superb. I was so thrilled to see most of the things I have never seen either in person or on TV/Moive, even though I was originally from that country.
Now I am going to buy it off Amazon and will put it along side of Planet Earth as my permanent collection.

September 13th. 2008:
Regrettably, I have to agree with some of the reviewers that the Blu-ray production is a letdown! Comparing to the original TV series I saw, the color is not as vivid, the image drifts in and out of focus leaving one wonders whether it is really HD.

It is very disappointing that such an amazing HD program came out to blu-ray like this.

I loved the information about how humans interact with nature, and the contrast that exists between wild China and industrialized China. Although the human overpopulation there is a grim situation, knowing that there are still pristine areas of the natural world being preserved on our planet was encouraging!  We didn't want the series to end.

By the way, we loved the common ""gimmick"" of the director or cinematographer to surprise the viewer when first introducing a subject, by showing it only in part at first or from a limited viewpoint before revealing the whole. This approach was often taken in scenes introducing camouflaged animals or initial limited viewpoints of grand landscapes. Who knew that bamboo could camouflage pandas so well?!  Very entertaining!

And actor Bernard Hill's narrating always hits the mark. His delivery is never boring nor overdramatic. Very balanced.

Given unprecedented access to the vast country, the renowned BBC Natural History Unit has produced a series full of breath-taking footage and amazing discoveries.

From the glittering peaks of the Himalayas to the teeming waters of the South China Sea. China encompasses a dazzling range of landscapes. The peaks, rainforests, deserts and caves of this vast and enigmatic country are home to a diverse array of wildlife ranging from giant pandas, tigers and golden snub-nosed monkeys to wild swans, whales sharks and beautiful tropical flowers.

As we travel through the deepest river-gorge in the world, watch fishermen using captive cormorants to gather fish and discover the remarkable Pallas' pip vipers that pluck birds from the air. It is clear, that, this amazing country is ready to reveal the most incredible wildlife surprises. Narrated by Bernard Hill.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 'Wild China' opens with subtle grace. In its first episode, ""Heart of the Dragon,"" the series travels to the rice paddies of South China and reveals some of the oldest known man-made structures in the world. From there, we get to see harvesting rituals in Guizhou, a community living in caves near Zhongdong, and traditional fisherman practicing their craft on the Li River. Along the way, a variety of birds, endangered primates, turtles, and other wildlife capture the crew's imagination and attention. ""Shangri-La"" moves to the base of the Himalayas and the Nujiang River. After documenting the lush plant life of the region, the second episode moves on to the snowy stretches of Kawakarpo, the diverse ecosystem of the Gaoligong Mountains, and the many cultures that inhabit the surrounding Yunnan province. Not only do elephants, jungle mammals, small apes, and other creatures make prominent appearances, but the NHU begins to look at the ever-intrusive presence of China's expanding cities.

Carefully sidestepping the more controversial elements of its political struggles, ""Tibet"" focuses on the Qingzang Plateau, the Buddhists who call it home, and the intriguing religious practices that influence everything in the region. More interestingly, the climate changes dramatically over the course of a few miles, leaving a variety of species to live side-by-side with humans. Moving across the Plateau, the crew devotes coverage to yaks, foxes, bears, and snakes, as well as the hot springs, freezing deserts, and vast hillsides of the area. ""Beyond the Great Wall"" heads north to the regions situated around... you guessed it... the Great Wall of China. More than a dry investigation into the construction and purpose of the Wall, this episode turns its eye to the ice fisherman of Manchuria, Mongolian horsemen who call miles of grassland home, and the shifting sands of the Taklimakan Desert. It also follows herds of reindeer, rare gazelle, wild horses, and trained eagles used for hunting.

As the series draws to a close, ""Land of the Panda"" turns to the Mandarin-speaking peoples of Central China. This episode delves into the tenuous relationship between man and beast, as well as civilization and the natural kingdom. It not only dedicates time to China's economy and political history, it weaves in tales of nearly-extinct alligators, revered animals in Beijing, and the pandas and endangered animals of the Qinling Mountains. Finally, ""Tides of Change"" traces China's coast, stopping along the way to spend time with migrating birds, jellyfish, crabs, and white dolphins. It even gives a glimpse into the lives of fisherman, oyster harvesters, and island dwellers. While it doesn't offer enough thematic closure to the series as a whole, it nevertheless does its job as another engaging episode.

`Wild China' is a stunning gorgeous and awesome documentary packed to the brim with remarkable cultures, captivating factoids, and totally awesome stunning breath-taking photography. While the series gives a thorough and extensive overview of China's people, animals, and societies, it doesn't dig into its more controversial political decisions, economic issues, human rights violations, or relations with other nations. Each episode has brief glimpses into each, but the production isn't willing to cross its established line and take its investigation any deeper. As a result, this particular visit to China occasionally comes across like a tourist video rather than a scrupulous study of the sprawling nation. Granted, these elements are hardly to the point and I wouldn't expect the BBC Natural History Unit to devote much time to them.

`Wild China' accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and gives a revealing glimpse into the far corners of the country. Once again, I have no idea how the BBC Natural History managed to capture some of the imagery that fills the documentary and, once again, I was bowled over by the riches and wonders of another culture. In my humble opinion, anyone with the faintest interest in China or the Asian mainland should give this documentary a spin. It may take a while to soak it all in, but the experience is well worth the investment.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The BBC have achieved another beautiful high definition production on this Blu-ray, and their documentary work never ceases to amaze the viewer. Going to great lengths to capture rare moments on film, the perseverance of the filmmakers and camera crew pays off in a grand fashion on this series. Encoded in 1080i, the focus on detail is apparent throughout the production. My favourite shot technique, used frequently in `Wild China' and several other BBC Natural History Unit productions, is an ultra-close-up that focuses the viewer on the colours, textures, and inherent beauty of the subjects, be they natural or artificial in origin. Although the picture is interlaced, it still contains a clarity that is hard to believe, given the filming access difficulty for much of the content. Aside from the slight softness lent by the interlaced picture, there is a small amount of colour banding noticeable here and there. Not surprising, given the high amount of rich, saturated colours that are present. Black levels are deep and satisfying, and never bloom and remain clear and intense. Texture is picked up beautifully, whether in long shots or the aforementioned ultra-close-ups. In short, `Wild China' boasts a superb, trademark BBC picture quality on this Blu-ray presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `Wild China' is impressive visual presentation is aided by a single 5.1 Dolby Digital track, which is more or less the standard for BBC high definition releases. It is a satisfactory offering that informs and mesmerises the. Ambiance is present for wildlife sequences, and likewise that of rural or nomadic human communities, but it's somewhat difficult to distinguish in the rears. Bernard Hill's rich, somewhat impassive narration, is kept to the centre channel, and is always clear. As an aside, his pronunciation of the many Chinese location names and titles is impressively spoken, flowing effortless from his tongue and causing the curious to reach for the English subtitle option. The score in the series is beautifully composed, taking its place in the ranks of nicely-done music for the BBC's documentary subjects. Never too brazen or pervasive, the strings-heavy pieces float along with each episode. It is a shame that the score isn't allowed to break beyond the confines of its compressed Dolby Digital mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Hunting Dragons  The Making of Wild China [2008] [1080p] This is the only extra feature on this Blu-ray release; a standard definition venture that runs about 27 minutes. In it, the challenge of obtaining some of the breath-taking shots in the series are explored, such as running a camera down a zip-line over a roaring river. Other difficulties are also discussed at length, such as traveling to remote locations via roughly-lain roads, or by camelback. One instance found the filmmakers at the bottom of a gorge after two days' worth of hiking, only to discover the camera broken after their descent. Language barriers were also, understandably, an issue. Clearly, everyone involved in the production of Wild China is extremely passionate about their work. Although `Hunting Dragons' may not be the most in-depth look at the filming process of the series, it is sufficient in showing the hardships endured to create it.

Finally, `Wild China' is another example of the brilliant professional work that BBC's Natural History Unit achieves almost effortlessly. The sheer amount of detail and carefully composed shots demonstrates a real appreciation for aesthetics and a stringently high level of production values. The results are superb examples of what can be achieved with the documentary format - educational material that is equally entertaining and awe-inspiring. China enjoys an odd dichotomy of sorts within the international community; it is so ubiquitous through its exports, and so geographically expansive, yet it is all the same so enigmatic and so closed to the world outside. This BBC Natural History production helps to open eyes to the beauty and ancient legacy of the country, and it looks stunning in high definition. It is not difficult to recommend this as a well-produced content and as a very nice Blu-ray package and I originally saw this on BBC Two in the United Kingdom and was totally bowled over by the stunning presentation at the time of the broadcast and this Blu-ray disc brings the images even more in an awesome experience and it knocked my socks off and it has now gone pride of place in my ever expanding BBC EARTH Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

The Chinese are tremendously conscience of their land and wildlife. I was astounded watching this and learning about the ways they farm on hillsides and how they treat their wildlife as sacred. The has a lot to do with their religion which is primarily Buddhism, something I didn't realize til watching this show.

This was very thoughtfully put together, and gives a pretty comprehensive overview of a huge country. You see much more of the country, as you might imagine, and less of urban China.

It does briefly mention the struggles of modern day China with its environment but the focus on what natural beauty still remains largely untouched in China is encouraging. Visually spectacular, it also shows that Chinese culture has always been deeply linked to its natural environment.

Never knew how amazing the wild life and country side of China is. All you see on the news is how their cities have domes of impenetrable polluted air that you need to cut with a knife to go through it.

Unfortunately a lot of the wild life is endangered which is an all too sad consequence of human need for never ending abuse of the environment. Consequently, this series could be the last place you might ever see some of the depicted life.

The cover shows one of the fishermen who use trained birds to FISH.... another amazing testimonial to the wonders of China and the Chinese.

The 3D effect version on the same disk is spectacular. Simple blue/red glasses work. Moving your head around produces depth you didn't even suspect was there. The color is lousy, of course, but the 3D is amazing.

The commentary is sparse and puerile. Example, ""A natural vault of rock keeps out the rain."" Duh. (The camera is looking 100s of feet out to a cave entrance.) Then, a picture of cows. ""These could be the only cave dwelling cows on Earth."" Or ... then again ... maybe they aren't. In any case, of what possible importance is their stable?

I particularly don't appreciate paying for a DVD, then having three minutes of BBC commercials, before I can select a menu. I paid, that's it. The DVD package doesn't say anything about dumb promotional material that must be watched every time.

You learn history, landscapes, traditions, and culture. It's beautiful and a bit sad to know that some ways of life are ending. The scene that stood out for me was capturing the wild panda eating bamboo that was covered in ice. This is gorgeous and a must buy on blu ray. It's lovely and well thought out.

The Producer, Director, team of photographers, editors and entire crew did an exceptional job of showing how breathtaking China is as I watched each episode. This is a British Production and I hope an award was giving for their work on this film. Check out YouTube  to see quick reels of how the show was filmed.

Not only for content and video quality, but mainly for the absolutely stunning camera work.  The very first episode shows that well.  There is a night time sequence of a very high speed camera recording a bat fishing in the dark that just has to be seen to be believed.  It is the best such a camera sequence I have ever seen!
The series is most highly recommended, and this from a very picky viewer who demands state of the art video quality and superior writing and camera work.  I am often disappointed by what I see on video.  I am thrilled by what I see on this one.",1385164800,,680,4.1923076923076925

3391157,5,B0016I0AH8,"This series has fantastic cinematography while being very informative. I found it to be full of fascinating facts.  It is at times more of a travelogue than a report on China's zoology, so don't expect a critical view of all of China's problems.  It tended to show everything in a very positive aspect, but this by no means lessens it's artistry or information content.",1384732800,,369,4.75

It shows the part of wilderness that hopefully still exists (as of 2008) and its struggle with the growing burden on the environmental and natural resources that are associated with China's economic development. There is great humor, natural beauty, and some positive messages that suggest that, when China puts its mind to protecting its natural resources, it could do a great job.",1382745600,,474,5.506849315068493

There is almost nothing on the large cities in China that most of us know something about.  This series deals with remoter areas of the country, environmental efforts by the government and the people, and a four-seasons look at the areas we visit.  There is information on the Three Gorges Project, but that is about the only topic that would have some familiarity to most people.

3391235,5,B0016I0AH8,"This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen and it is no joke. It truly is an ambitious endeavor of covering so much information for so many remote and diverse regions and climates of China. It allows the viewer a look into a frontier that is rarely viewed and gives the feeling of dreaming of exploring these lands.

Picture:
The HD resolution of the images captured from the different creatures, peoples, and regions are astounding. They took a truly cinematic approach when creating the wonderful story of Wild China. There are several instances where I wonder ""HOW DID THEY DO THAT"" with some of the shots, such as wild animals atop of thick snow encrusted areas where the air is dangerously thin, or the tremendous time lapses showing the beauty of the deep canyons or fauna. One particular scene was with wild Panda going through a fight and a mating ritual all with closeness and being the first to ever capture said event on film (they are writing history).

The sheer scope of what has been covered in the series is truly astounding and gives me the desire to watch it over and over again (and I have done just that).

Sound:
This is another area that separates this from other documentaries, the film score with all the reprises and subtleties is absolutely an emotionally lifting event. It truly marries the sound with picture.

The sound (effects / voice over) are well channeled allowing you to hear so much depth, and there are hundreds of instances where you can only wonder ""HOW DID THEY DO THAT"" with their audio captures. There are circumstances where the camera is clearly extremely far from the subject as to not give away location, but the audio never fails to be crystal clear, allowing the user to truly dive deep into the atmosphere.

In comparison, I have seen and own Planet Earth on blu-ray and I can say hands down that this is better, I'm not sure if it's the fact that this continuously focused on the relationship between Man and Earth and Man and Animal always showing the impact of man, but I truly fell in love with it.

If you love documentaries, animals, or just want to go explore a new place then this is the perfect series for you, I have not been disappointed and have only watched it more and more learning new things each time. It is seamless, well shot, and ground breaking and for this I give it 5 out of 5.",1353801600,,2366,4.542253521126761
3391236,2,B0016I0AH8,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this series. There was very little ""wild"" in the content. Most of the sections were about the people of China, with an occasional animal--or two--thrown in with what can only be described as inadequate information on them. For example (spoiler alert), the episode on Tibet is mostly about the spiritual beliefs and practices of the region. The Tibetan bear did appear--which I thought was going to be very interesting since I'd never seen one before--but only briefly. He is taped looking over a hill and then running away. There is very little wildlife at all in most of the episodes so I'm a little dismayed that ""wild"" is part of the title. The Siberian tiger is seen, but in captivity. The Chinese crocodile is also shown, but in a breeding centre. There is one section that shows the mating of wild pandas (the only time this has been caught on film), but the majority of video elsewhere about pandas is in a breeding centre. Unfortunately, most of the scenes in all the episodes are about Chinese people, and how they live in different areas of the country. That to me is not about nature, which this series purports to be.

Bernard Hill has a lovely voice, but his script doesn't have much in the way of content. Much of it is repetitive. (In one episode he mentions how the Chinese government established conservation laws--in three separate parts of the same episode.)

I can't give this documentary a good rating. The packaging is beautiful, but the material in the series isn't what it suggests, and what there is in it is limited and poorly presented.",1349654400,12,1604,4.6643109540636045

3391238,5,B0016I0AH8,"Excellent and eye-opening presentations of China. As always, BBC documentary teams painstakingly captured the vase and diverse landscape of this nation and helped viewers to understand how great peaks of Tibetan mountains are feeding water to half the world's population. It also demonstrated the black side of China's exploitation of natural resouces and yet many white sides of her conservations of wildlife and environment.

Episodes immerse the viewer, causing one to wonder what is more to be shown or discovered. Some footages were filmed for the first time.

I am surprised on the ecosystems and animals that China is able to support and still exist.

I only saw one obvious seen of some flowers out of focus for a short moment, or may be focus on something else. Overall, picture quality is excellent. The background music is not overpowering, and the voice is lively and easy to understand.

Although the videos were filmed before the 2008 Olympics, much of the scenes, discoveries, conservaton efforts, wildlife, different groups of people and their ways of life, remain new and informative to people who want to know more about the region.

I have always been captivated by China's Great Wall, and this documentary does not disappoint!  Although no 2 blu-ray disc set can fully capture such a massive country in its entirety, Wild China certainly touches enough on the peoples, landscapes, flora and fauna to leave you satiated.

However, Wild China's video is good quality HD (I looked at this blu-ray on a 55 inch and had no issues other than some 'softness' in the video).

The narration is done by by 'new kid on the block' Bernard Hill (actor King Th&eacute;oden in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy).  Although I have grown accustomed to David Attenborough's narration (Life and Planet Earth), I must admit - Bernard Hill does a great job, giving&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-China-s/dp/B0016I0AI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild China's</a>&nbsp;narration a truly Royal treatment! :))

The film does not dwell too much on China's environmental problems, but also does not gloss over these. Instead, this film primarily seeks to preserve the incredible and unique beauty that can still be found in China.

Some of the shots that were captured are extraordinarily rare, and in some cases, this crew was the first to film (I will not spoil which; these are revealed). Suffice to say, we were wowed by the Blu-Ray quality: the depth of picture, the richness of the color, and the detail afforded to this nearly-lossless format (you can see individual strands of a spider's web, droplets of rain, blades of grass, reflections in animals' eyes...)

If you are at all interested in China, animals, people, or landscapes (or all of these, like I am), do not hesitate, do not pass Go... buy this documentary! There is no way you will be disappointed.

Viewing tip: Watch them all in order, then watch the ""making of"" special feature on Disc 2 to appreciate some of the more difficult shots.

The episode ""beyond the great wall"" is breathtaking (no excuse for this old cliche)...a tropical rainforest/jungle in China?
Seeing these programmes make us want to go there....and with 3 episodes to view we'll have new experiences...next is a programme on Pandas...seeing these animals up close and personal (and in the wild) via blu-ray is going to be a most gratifying experience.
Indonesia is a little behind when it comes to High Definition Television.....no terrestrial or cable HD providers so we have to ""order in"" and thank goodness fo Amazon.com....having this excellennt series and being able to see it anytime we want is even better than having to rely on a so far non-existent HD provider.

Gorgeous scenery, fascinating nature documentary, equally fascinating depictions of the highly diverse Chinese culture, with a beautiful musical score consisting of a soothing blend of traditional Chinese music and compatible western adaptations. This is not just a nature documentary.  It also discusses in some depth the evolving relationships between the Chinese, their environment and the creatures that coexist with them. I will probably remember the scenes of Chinese cultural life depicted in this series long after I've forgotten the footage of the wild critters of their land. This was a real eye-opener for someone whose main experiences of the Chinese unfortunately occur mostly in local restaurants.  A must see.

3391297,5,B0016I0AH8,"All of us in the UK give the BBC a hard time for churning our rubbish at our expense and then something comes along and you say: ""all is forgiven!"" This is a fine example of the greatness of the BBC. A poet wrote (I can't remember who): ""the beauty of the world has made me sad, a beauty that will pass"" or something to that effect. Now I don't go along with the tone of the poem which is depressive, I can understand though the poet's being moved by the grandeur of nature. And this is precisely what happened to me watching this wonderful programme - a sense of how awesome nature is and how awesome man is who is shown in this series to blend with nature and harness its powers. I was particularly struck by the fisherman with their captive comorants who had been trained to work alongside the fishermen essentially to do their fishing for them. And, the landscapes and the extraordinary monkies etc - wonderful.

One slightly negative point and that it is obvious that to obtain chinese approval a certain degree of compromise was necessary - thus in the Tibet programme we are simply told that Tibet has been part of China for 50 years i.e. there is no mention that it was annexed. Anyway, this is a small quibble.

3391333,5,B0016I0AH8,"This is not just about nature but China and its relationship, no, its dependence and links with nature.  Sometimes there is a balance and sometimes not.  For example, the people of China seem willing to eat anything, rare or not, and many animals from around the world are endangered because of this need to feed.  Yet they also respect the land, the rivers and many of the animals, which they see are bringing them good luck.  That is why I have a mixed feeling when watching the DVDs on Wild China.  So much is being done to save some animals and plants, yet others seem doomed.  China is trying but, let us face facts, they have millions of people to feed and support.  Can nature survive in China?  Should the outside world help before we lose some of the greatest treasures of the natural world?  Should they help nature while letting their own people suffer? 300 minutes and a making of feature to boot.
The landscape is lovely, the music perfect and the glimpse of Chinese culture, from all over China, a must.  Some scenes may upset the kids, and adults, but I think the knowledge gained by watching Wild China outweighs any discomfort one may feel when watching the DVDs.",1250380800,,1180,4.549763033175355

To say this DVD exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I was amazed at the cinematography and choice of locations. There was so much variety and beauty. I learned more about this fantastic country's topography AND it dispelled a few of my negative opinions of their pollution, land destruction and neglect of its fauna and flora. I was so impressed that conservation is at the peasant level upward for several species. I re-watched several episodes just for the sheer pleasure of this eye candy experience. Although it is a lengthy documentary, it left me desiring more. I'd always thought I would like to visit China and stick to the usual tourist attractions that several of my friends have visited and my timeshare offers. Now that I've been exposed to the various landscapes that cover such a vast area, I realize I will really need to plan well and of course spend more vacation time than I tentatively planned. Surely viewing this DVD will lend a more tolerant understanding and appreciation of China's people, culture, and natural resources (note I omitted politics).

3391359,4,B0016I0AH8,"This is another outstanding British series with excellent production values and plenty for everyone.  The makers clearly took full advantage of the pre-Olympic mandated official Chinese tolerance of western journalists, and traveled the length and breadth of the country to document its seldom-seen wildlife.  The results are stunning.  Each episode covers a geographical area and the focus is largely on photogenic megafauna, but there is so much that is new that this is an acceptable gloss.

What is less acceptable is the narration, which avoids all issues that might be even vaguely contentious.  Again and again individual Chinese efforts at conservation are praised, vignettes are tenderly shown, and the almost soporiphic narration sooths us from one gentle scene to another.  Of course a wildlife series is no place for political commentary, but a little more might reasonably have been said about why such conservation is necessary, and whether it can possibly have efficacy in the face of overwhelming forces to the contrary.  Additionally it would have been nice to have had narration with a greater emphasis on detail: the habits of the animals shown are not explored in any real depth.  This series is more in the pattern of National Geographic programs whereby pretty pictures are presumed enough and information is regarded as a potential threat to viewing figures.  Again and again as we watched the episodes, members of my family would comment that the narrator wasn't really telling us anything.  At one point my daughter said, ""I wish they'd asked David Attenborough to do this series.""

Perhaps we live in an age where information-lite is transforming to information-free; an age in which spectacular photography is considered sufficient unto itself.  If so, we can expect more series of this type: beautifully filmed, captivatingly framed, but ultimately unsatisfying because they tell us so very little about the creatures being presented and about the underlying dynamics of the environments in which they exist.",1225238400,7,2036,5.308411214953271

With sharp focusing it would have been 5 stars, no doubt. I don't think it is the 1080i or p - its plain bad photography work, I would guess. The subtitles stick out from the blurry picture and also the animations in the chapter beginnings are fine and sharp. So its not encoding.
The cameramen either used some low end HD cams or they were not on the top of their job. Some scenes look nice - but most of them not. What a waste of time on a great subject, then the end result is...hmm... compromised, to be modest.

The photography in this series is just stunning, similar to BBC's Planet Earth. Also I like the way they document the interaction between people and landscape and wildlife. I think this is the most important aspect of conservation in China today - how to achieve the balance between progress and conservation.

Many of the locations in this documentary I have not heard of before. Also many of the wildlife species are very rare and the footage is extremely available to the public.
