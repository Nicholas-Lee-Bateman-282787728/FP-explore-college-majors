8474985,5,B000H8RYN6,"This is a great video on flame working and on marble making. I highly recommend it. I just wish there was a follow-up advanced DVD. The techniques shown are easy to follow.  I have a lot of books and a lot of DVDs. I've taken a lot of classes. It really helps to have things in this format. I love that I can rewind, stop, etc. Great DVD.",1424995200,,338,3.9705882352941178
