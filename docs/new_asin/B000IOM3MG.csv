8146661,3,B000IOM3MG,"We are planning a trip to Yap & Palau, so I got this dvd for my husband for his birthday to give him an idea of what we would be seeing. It's not a life-changing, amazing, outstanding dvd but it does give you an overall impression of the 4 islands. I thought it was interesting that the island with the least amount of footage--or so it seemed to me--was Palau; surely Palau is the most popular and more famous destination?

Anyway, watching the DVD did the trick--we are more psyched than ever to go!",1272067200,2,501,4.329787234042553
