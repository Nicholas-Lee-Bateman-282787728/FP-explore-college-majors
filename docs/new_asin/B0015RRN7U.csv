8259636,3,B0015RRN7U,"The original 1979, while bad, is campy bad. It somewhat followed the book--if you really want to be frighted, read that. Otherwise, if in bargain bin I would get it, it has good moments. Keep in mind I haven't seen it for several years and bought it because my nearly 17 year old is doing horror film catch up.  The 2005 remake, I have not seen as yet, only heard second hand they it varies from first movie and book, adding things--don't know, when I see it I will come back with update.",1471824000,,488,4.247311827956989

8259639,5,B0015RRN7U,I liked the original Amityville Horror 1979 and wanted to own it on DVD. I like horror movies and this one is a good one that stars James Brolin & Margot Kidder who move into a house where some murders were committed and then strange things begin to happen to the family. The 2005 version was also good and it was nice having both versions.,1446940800,,340,4.246153846153846
