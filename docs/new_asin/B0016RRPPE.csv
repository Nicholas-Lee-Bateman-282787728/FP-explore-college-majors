8264192,2,B0016RRPPE,"I know Amazon dislikes it when reviewers discuss physical flaws in a DVD rather than the content of the DVD itself (because everyone's product experience may be different) but this case it is only fair to warn any perspective buyer of THE MASTER that half of what you are getting does not work.

This DVD is supposed to contain the first two episodes of the short-lived Lee Van Cleef series THE MASTER (1984). It does, but unfortunately the second of the two episodes, ""Out of Time-Step"" has improperly synced sound, so that the dialogue comes about five full seconds after the actors speak their lines. This made watching the episode impossible (unless you are so stoned that the noise and the image somehow resync themselves; but I'm not sure anyone can get that high). Thus, you are only getting half of what you pay for. As for the image quality, it is shabby and looks about a half-step above film-chain transfer. I am telling you this because the other reviews here make it clear that this problem exists in either all or many of the DVDs and is not limited to my experience.

It is especially unfortunate that this thing is a clunker because the packaging is gorgeous, and THE MASTER, for all of its awfulness and absurdity, is a hell of a lot of fun to watch. Which brings me to the review proper. THE MASTER is the story of John Peter McCallister (Lee Van Cleef), a white man who, as part of the U.S. occupation army in Japan after WW2, became the first ""occidental"" to become a ninja. McCallister, a rather old man when the story begins, is nearly assassinated by his treacherous former protege Okasa (Sho Kosugi), but escapes Japan in an airplane, heading to America to find his long-lost daughter. At the same time, he runs into transient oaf Max Keller (Timothy Van Patten), a do-gooding drifter who drives around in a van, talks to his pet hamster, and gets thrown through a lot of bar windows. Taking Keller as his pupil, the Master searches America for his daughter while trying to avoid the relentless pursuit of Okasa and, wherever he goes, putting his ninja skills to use against local villains. (The pilot is noteworthy for featuring veteran B-movie actor Clu Gallagher as the bad guy, Claude Akins as the good guy, and a young Demi Moore as the good guy's daughter.)

Strictly speaking, THE MASTER is, of course, a terrible television show. The dialogue is often painful and full of fortune-cookie wisdom, the character of Max Keller is terribly annoying, and Van Cleef looks utterly absurd walking around in a ninja costume in modern-day America. (He even looks absurd in civilian clothes, since he insists on wearing an enormous ninja medallion around his neck at all times.) What's more, Van Cleef was half-crippled by a knee injury long before the show aired, which means about 99% of his action sequences are done by a stunt man who is considerably slimmer than Van Cleef -- something I spotted even as a boy of twelve, watching this show when it was originally on TV. However, none of this matters, because THE MASTER is, in spite of (or because of) its flaws a very fun way to pass your time. It is the sort of show you put in the player as much for the pleasure of ridiculing it as the fun of watching, and I'd be lying if I didn't say there isn't a certain chemistry between Van Cleef and Van Patten. Most importantly, the show had just enough self-awareness to poke some mild fun at itself, if only through the interplay between McCallister and Keller.

Having said all this, and since the series has yet to be released in its entirely in one set of DVDs, you may as well go to iOffer and buy all thirteen episodes, as you can get them for the same price as these two...one of which does not work!",1511136000,,3728,4.568011958146487
