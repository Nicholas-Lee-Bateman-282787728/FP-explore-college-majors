7982865,1,B00008G6K2,"I picked this book up in a used book store.
I took a quick look in the Index to see what the authors had written about the 'swastika cross', in their quest for TRUTH.
I quickly realized this was another book of judeao/christian fiction.
There was NOT ONE ENTRY in the Index about the swastika?
How could that be.

Here are 6 facts re: why I EXPECTED to find SOME reference to the pre-LITERATE symbol, the swastika.
1/ The swastika was mankind's first exoteric symbol for god/YHVH/Jehovah, and it has been called by many different names worldwide during its history, up until the start of the Christian era.
What did Schliemann find in TROY?
Swastikas, whorls etc...

2/ The oldest SWASTIKA we have can be traced to 10,000 BC, found in the Ukraine.

3/ Plato's description of mythical Atlantis mentions the colors of the stones used to build Atlantis as BLACK WHITE RED

4/ BLACK WHITE RED are the 3 stages of alchemy, BLACK WHITE RED are the same 3 colors as the BULLS in the Book of Enoch, BLACK WHITE RED are the 3 colors that Hitler used in the Swastika he teased the world with, BLACK WHITE RED are also a direct ripoff of the Teutonic Knights Flag, who in fact had an pledged allegiance to the Vatican.
In 1938 Hitler disbanded the Teutonic Knights.

5/ And the most common cross worn as an amulet while CHRIST was supposedly walking on water, performing miracles was, yup you guessed it, the PAGAN UNIVERSAL SWASTIKA, still revered as a symbol for god by the Buddhist Jains.

6/ All SS, Secret Societies, once you pull back the veils, guard/hide/veil the swastika.
Including the Freemasons, Rosicrucian, and  the Vatican too of course.

This book is pure nonsense, I knew that before even reading it.
Just more scholarly BS that negates other scholarly BS.
And all the scholars get tenure and collect a pension too?
The world has some serious problems caused by all the Levant Ph. D who fail to agree.

google the following terms and let the REAL QUEST for TRUTH begin regarding the TRUE CROSS

'SWASTIKA the KEY to Universal Movement'

Who called the SWASTIKA the KEY to Universal Movement?
The folks who inhabited the area around Mexico City prior to the Aztec, long long long before Jesus was ever born.
Remember we can trace it too 10,000 BC.
That is where the quest for the TRUE CROSS should begin.

7982866,5,B00008G6K2,"""The Quest for the True Cross"" is an amalgamation and scholarly distillation of the data surrounding the search for and purported finding of the True Cross; that is, the cross upon which Jesus of Nazareth was crucified.  Although I was predisposed to dismiss this book as make believe, I was ever so incrementally persuaded by the reasonable and remarkable structure given to what I had regularly dismissed as an unfathomable legend.  This treatise is a perfect example of the capacity of reason to deduce important meaning even amidst abysmal cultural, historical, and religious noise regarding this subject.  The necessarily complex analysis of the long-ignored fragment of the Titulus Crucis, the inscribed headboard of Christ's cross, is compelling.  ""The Quest"" is nothing less than awesome in its methodology and conclusions.  A chip off ""The Jesus Papyrus.""",1168128000,,864,5.37037037037037
7982867,5,B00008G6K2,"Personally, I loved this unpretentious program that approached the topic of the whereabouts of the original cross and titis of Christ

both intelligently and yet with the pragmatism of whether either may really still exist. Mysteries of this type are intriguing, but without definitive proof, leaves our true faith and belief in what those artifacts represent more important than what we're told they should. Is the shroud the real shroud or the titis the real titis? We all search, we all have our beliefs. The strength of those beliefs determine what's right for each of us. Good show!",1140048000,3,587,4.989795918367347
7982868,5,B00008G6K2,"Carsten Peter Thiede was already a purportedly controversial and world-class scholar with his work on the roguishly new dating of Mark's gospel when he approached this unprecedented and ground-breaking investigation of the Titulus of Santa Croce, in Rome. The Santa Croce Church, having stood in the same plaque of land for 1700 years prior, regularly housed said aforementioned titulus for those same 1700 years. A titulus, which, for the uninitiated into this area of interest, is the headboard above criminals' heads on a cross, who were put to death by crucifixion, a worrisomely merciless practice of the Roman Empire. The titulus from Santa Croce is the one allegedly belonging to Christ's cross, a disputable and unproven insinuation, one that Thiede nevertheless strives to make a case for in his newest book.

In said book, Thiede submits some tantalizing and, more valuably, convincing evidence for this titulus to specifically be that of Christ's. Number one is the order of languages in which the mocking Roman inscription-which always was used to convey the charge against the criminal being executed-""Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews"" is transcribed onto the titulus. Actually, since only a fragment of the headboard remains, this line should be modified to only state ""Jesus of Nazareth"". In the Bible, this order is written first in Hebrew, Greek, then Latin. This order on the Titulus of Santa Croce is one that violates the order in which the Bible documents the languages as appearing on the headboard. This permeates with credibility, because, had this order on the titulus been fabricated, no one would have crawled to producing such a glaringly bad imitation. Consequently, this can only mean one thing, that, were the Santa Croce Titulus really a fabrication, the professional forger would have been duped into copying the contraband order written in the Bible, because it was more accessible. Secondly, is the suspiciously eye-raising direction in which the Hebrew inscription ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is written, which is from right to left. Once again, discounting fakes because of its horrid obviousness, Thiede believes this was inscribed by a Jewish scholar, as it was the traditional Hebrew writing style of the day, around the date of Christ's crucifixion. Thirdly, casting dubiousness on its falsehood, is the introduction of a specific style of abbreviation on the Titulus of Santa Croce, one that died out from common use at the time after Christ's crucifixion, once more linking the headboard to the official one.

Furthermore, to prove that the titulus belonged to Christ, Thiede has to establish a definite connection between the crucifixion and that part of the cross actually coming to the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because said titulus is from Santa Croce, the church in Rome. According to legend, the titulus was recovered to Rome by Helena, Emperor Constantine's 80-year old mom. Constantine seized control of the whole Empire when he defeated his arch-nemesis, Emperor Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge. The Empire had, up to that point, been ostracized into 4 regions, each governed by 4 different Roman rulers. Constantine, allegedly, had a vision of the Cross in the clouds, before crossing the Milvian Bridge in the battle against Maxentius, which implored him to paint a Chi-Rho symbol-the 1st version of Christianity's symbol-on all his men's shields. Constantine embezzled that Christianity had granted him his victory-he then started to oppress Christianity as the official religion of the Empire. As another part of his ambivalent ""conversion"" of himself and the entire Empire to Christianity, he procured his mom to bring the relic to 3 parts of the Empire as a rallying point for early Christians to have something palpable to believe in.

What Thiede does is to try to produce legitimate connections to the titulus which was carried back by Helena, and the actual titulus of Christ by citing logical coincidences of events that could only happen during the specific range of the time of Christ. For instance, nowadays, there exists the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, sitting over the place where Christ was crucified, and believed to have been the site of the titulus. In the catacombs beneath this church lie inscriptional records of early pilgrims' journeys to this site-one such from Crusaders, and another from seafarers who make a definite reference to a biblical psalm in giving thanks for their opportunity to worship at the site, believing it to be the licit place containing Christ's relics, and who wouldn't have risked catastrophic chances traveling across the sea to get there, were they not actually certain of its status. This verifies the already historical knowledge of the fact that, in the 1st few centuries of Christianity, there was NEVER any dispute over the actual holy sites. Additionally, there is evidence of Jews building tombs over this same area, even for the ones stigmatized as ""criminals"", as proven by the finding of a burial box containing a nail through the heel bone of a foot, and Jesus would have been libeled as a ""criminal"" by the Jews. Another tying of the Santa Croce Titulus to Christ's time is the fact that in the 1400s it was discovered in Helena's ""palace""-directly behind Santa Croce-hidden behind a fresco, because Helena is supposed to have taken it, the 3rd fragment of the entire headboard, back with her after discovering the titulus at the previous site of, first, the temple to the Roman god Venus, which was then promptly aborted for Constantine's building of a monumental complex to Christianity, all on the same site. Upon the uncovering of the titulus, again, in the 1400s, El Greco used it in a painting of his, further documenting its validity.

These may be circumstantial evidence, but they stimulate the next best thing towards solid proof of this titulus being that of Christ's: raising the question of a plausible feasibility that the Santa Croce Titulus could be Christ's, through an assemblage of circumstantial facts which, together, conclude quite logically its divine connection.",1111363200,6,6106,5.152217741935484
