8132677,5,B000GI3KRG,This video is just what I need for the Masters' students in American Indian Welfare Policy courses. Excellent.,1513555200,,110,5.166666666666667
8132678,5,B000GI3KRG,This product presents the history of triba/federal relations in a manner that is easily understood by all.  It teaches tribes that they are not alone with heir mistreatment by the federal government.  This will be shown to all our communities and our Native Cirriculum in our Community College.,1360022400,,294,5.104166666666667
8132679,4,B000GI3KRG,"First saw this as a Netflix rental, but I found it so informative that I wanted to own it so that I could share it with friends and family.  I especially want to use it to educate others about the very sad and dark aspect of our nation.  We prefer not to advertise what our government has done to the Native Americans, but I bet there are nations around the world that clearly realize this part of our history and are amused by our duplicity and dishonesty when we violate and invade the soverignty of other nations.",1294876800,,516,4.309278350515464
8132680,3,B000GI3KRG,"I bought this hoping to use it as a resource before our group goes to Pine Ridge next summer - but I'm not going to use it.  It is too technical in some areas and not precise enough in others.  The production value is not what I expected with such a name as Sam Donaldson attached.  There are plenty of other resources, including Ken Burns' The West, and the HBO movie Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.  I learned much more about the Dawes Act and other atrocities in that movie than this documentary.  Also check out the movie Smoke Signals.",1229385600,,539,4.297029702970297
8132681,2,B000GI3KRG,"It's important that humankind never forget the tragedies of slavery, concentration camps, and New World genocide.  However, that doesn't make them easy topics to digest.  For example, I'd like to see Liam Neesom nude but not if that means watching the inhumanity displayed in ""Schindler's List.""  The same catch-22 happens here.  It's important for people in the new millennium to know that Native Americans have been and continue to be dispossessed.  However, it won't make you day to see or hear 80 minutes of a discussion on the topic.

This documentary had diverse speakers:  female and male, Native and non-Native.  However, I don't think Sam Donaldson did a strong job in directing this work.  One interviewee is a law professor, yet two of his front teeth look melted together and the large tooth had a big, nasty cavity on it.  I'm sure a dentist could hook him up and that he can afford it.

I took a Federal Indian Law course and it was far from a piece of cake.  This documentary focuses on the laws that ripped land away from Native Americans.  Students in that course may benefit from seeing this.  I'm not sure if this work would be too legalistic for others, but it does attempt at being user-friendly.",1177372800,8,1217,4.706161137440758
