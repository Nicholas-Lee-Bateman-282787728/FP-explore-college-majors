8622371,4,B00GDKX436,"I purchased this a few years ago after watching a preview. Even though its made for sculpture, I got it mainly to help with my artistic anatomy and 3D modelling studies. And it did actually help me to see the lessons outlined on a live model (even though its on film) rather done from a book. It gives you more of a sense of realism when seeing a filmed living breathing person modeling for the lessons. I seemed to get as sense of depth, space, and those other nuances when viewing a live model that you cannot get from a book.

Although its good, its mostly basic material. It doesn't give you something more advanced in the way of actual shown lessons. Also its mainly about the female figure. There is some reference on the male figure but it is very little. Despite these drawbacks I found it useful. It's good as reference material, seeing something articulated on an actual living model. The model selection for this presentation was also good. Specially when it came to the main female model. I really do believe choice of models is crucial to products like these specially when you only have a few models. A good Model can act like a muse to help make study more enjoyable and inspire you to create.

The way the video is presented, the lessons were segmented by body part. It starts with the head, then chest, back, and so forth. The lessons are taught by the instructor referring to the bodies of live nude models so you can see the living breathing examples. And the main female model is presented completely nude throughout all the lessons which is greatly preferred for artistic learning, but something too keep in mind if you intent to show this to younger viewers. And if it helps, she is very pleasant to look at which can make learning a lot easier and/or inspiring for most. These lessons are mainly explanations of the proportions and what to remember when constructing each part of the body. Similar to how it would be using a live model in an actual anatomical art class. With the video having the benefit of  close-ups, so you can see the close-up of the ear or eye for example, that you may not get in a live class. Overall its a good beginners learning video, or for advance students can be used as reference or refresher.",1398038400,3,2247,4.515970515970516
