This is a great edition, with a bonus dvd full of extras and PRE-CUT CARDBOARD MODELS inside the box. Everything would be wonderful BUT I tried it to check if it was really region free and it worked perfectly bringing the painful revelation that it has no subtitles. No subtitles. No subtitles. I's a region free edition of a japanese movie and it has NO SUBTITLES. What's the point of making it region free?! So regretfully I had to return it. But, for japanese speaking children out there, this is a wonderful edition.",1476057600,,606,4.468468468468468
8447139,1,B000GTLQF8,"IN 1995 THE WORLD SAW THE REBIRTH OF GAMERA! This was a milestone compared to the 3rd rate original series. The story was great  and the special effects were great! The two more movies that came afterward were  great as well. Then this steaming piece of turtle crap came out.
A new film company acquired Gamera and planned to make it kid friendly again. Gamera The Brave is anything but brave.
 This so called monster is called Toto, and he looks like Yertle the turtle with tusk. Gone was the classic roar and in it's place was Spot's roar from The Munsters. The majority  of the plot was stolen from the Universal Movie: E.T. they should sue. This Year a Trailer for the new CGI monster movie: ""GAMERA"" WAS SHOWN ON YOUTUBE! You should buy that movie when it comes out and forget about this flying piece of turd!",1444521600,3,814,4.442953020134228
