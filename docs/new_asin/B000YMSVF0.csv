8233497,5,B000YMSVF0,We saw the author at an orchid show but failed to purchase the dvd then but when I saw it on Amazon much later I decided to make the purchase.  Very informative.,1313712000,,161,4.03125
8233498,5,B000YMSVF0,"I belong to the Central Coast Orchid Society based in Cambria, CA, and watched the video at a regular meeting recently.  I've belonged to this organization for almost 10 years and have viewed many orchid videos over the years.  I believe this is the best basic orchid care video I have ever viewed.  In addition, the ""Wrangler's"" presentation style and organization was very pleasing.  This video is a ""must see"" for anyone who has ever hesitated to purchase an orchid plant because they think orchids require extraordinary care; they're no more difficult to care for than any other house plant.",1237248000,3,595,4.92
8233499,5,B000YMSVF0,"This is a ""must have"" instructional DVD for all those who love orchids and need to know the basics of how to care for these beautiful plants.
I learned so much on how to water, prune, re-pot, and encourage a ""second blooming"" just from my initial viewing.  David Stanley is a great instructor, and not only takes time in explaining the various steps in growing orchids, but he also shows how it is done.",1207440000,5,403,4.445945945945946
