But one of the main functions of a university education is teach students to be optimal and rational!  I've spent much of my career in applied optimization for science, engineering, and management, and so I've acted in an optimal and rational manner.  The professor's lectures are remarkably tedious, and his suggestions for improved decision-making are nearly worthless.  With modern computer technology and decision support software, like the software packages I've created, anyone can make truly optimal and rational decisions for one's life or business.  Don't waste your time on this silly course!",1477353600,,730,5.368421052631579
