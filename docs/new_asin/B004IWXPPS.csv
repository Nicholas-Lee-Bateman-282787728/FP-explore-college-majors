8431300,1,B004IWXPPS,"My copy of the Film sent by Amazon was as rip off:  It says  that the language is ""Russian with English subtitles"" . There were occasional English subtitles, no more than eight in all !!!!
Then the format was  the flat  film format presented  in scope !!!!! making the images senseless:  only the heads of the actors could be seen!

Quite to the contrary to what is mentioned as an epic, it is a cheap, budget movie, with a few extras pressed into service for the ""battle scenes"". Not a single long shot to show a battle worthy of its name.

What a sham.",1408579200,,554,4.259615384615385
8431301,4,B004IWXPPS,"I liked this 2010 Russian historical film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

This film was made to mark the 1000 anniversary of foundation of city of Yaroslavl, but also to tell the story of early years of its founder, prince Yaroslav of Rostov who was later to become Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev.

Prince Yaroslav was born in 978 in Kiev as second son of Vladimir the Great, Grand Prince of Kiev (980-1015) and his wife Rogneda of Polotsk. Vladimir was already then the ruler of a very large state, but with time he increased its size significantly. In 1001 his oldest son Izyaslav died and therefore Yaroslav became the heir to the throne. Soon after his father gave him an inportant assignement by sending him to the province of Rostov, a large but still scarcely populated north-eastern march of huge Kiev state. Yaroslav had to rule, protect and if possible expand this territory - and by doing this he was to learn the art of government and warfare, for the time when he would have to succeed his father.

Anticipating here on the events described in the film, it is useful to know that prince Yaroslav would ultimately become the Grand Prince of Kiev, but only in 1019, after four years of brutal civil war against his half-brother Sviatopolk and his Polish and Pecheneg allies. His rule was long (1019-1054) and highly succesful and as under his rule the state of Kiev grew powerful and wealthy, he was to be remembered by future generations as Yaroslav the Wise.

This film tells about a half-legendary episode from Yaroslav life which happened in 1010, towards the end of his service as ruler of Rostov province. This territory was very exposed to raids of slavers who would attack either by navigating on Volga or arriving on horse back by land and then abduct those men and women who could be sold on great slave markets in Arab-Muslim world, especially in Bagdad. In Middle Ages the Arabo-Muslim world was always hungry for slaves and as Muslims in principle couldn't be reduced into slavery, it was necessary to bring them from Christian and pagan areas. In the eastern part of Europe it was Kiev Russia and its successor states who were the principal target of slavers and from VIII to XIII century countless hundreds of thousands of people were abducted and sold into slavery - from which there was virtually no escape...

In order to protect his eastern border but also to block the slavers from navigating further north, Yaroslav build in 1010 a strongly fortified settlement, which was to serve as a military fort and also a trading post, in a well protected place where the huge Volga river is joined by a smaller one, the Kotorosl. He called this new settlement simply Yaroslavl, which means literally ""Yaroslav's"" like in ""Yaroslav's place"". Those events are very real. However, according to the traditional legends, in order to make certain that this place will serve its purpose and thrive he had to make a deal with local inhabitants, the Bear Tribe. Those people were not Russians, but most probably one of many indigenous Finno-Ugrian tribes who lived there since thousands of years - and could be quite dangerous when fighting in their familiar forest wilderness...  Those people were also still pagans and the symbol (and holy animal) of their main deity, Veles, was a bear. There probably was such a pact made between Yaroslav and locals, because from the oldest times the coat of arms of city of Yaroslavl was indeed a ferocious bear...

This film describes Yaroslav's (Aleksandr Ivashkevich) fight against slavers and his dealings with the Bear tribe, but also some sinister plots - almost never absent from any place of power... It also shows a heart-breaking love triangle situation. Yaroslav is in this film married to beautiful young noble woman Zhelana (Elena Plaksina) - a fictitious character by the way - who was forced into this marriage by her ambitious father. Zhelana is an obedient daughter, she tries hard to be a good wife and she already bore Yaroslav a son - but she doesn't love her husband as, since like always, her heart belongs to... well, somebody else.

This is an interesting film showing, I believe, quite well the realities of XI century Russia. The wooden-build city of Rostov and the fortified forest fortress of Bear Tribe are very well made. The multi-ethnic character of Kiev state is very well shown, as in this film we can see Russians, Finno-Ugrians and Varangians (Norsemen), many of whom serve as elite warriors to the princes of Kiev (who themselves were of Scandinavian descent). The weapons and armor reconstructions are very honest. We also can see at least one historical character other than Yaroslav himself - it is his chief retainer Vyshata (Vladimir Antonik). Many years later, in 1043, this man was going to lead a huge (but ultimately unsuccesful) Russian naval raid against Constantinople!

On another hand, if the plot is not bad, it still disappoints a little, especially towards the end. I can not go into details to avoid spoilers, but this film ends with a whisper rather than with a bang. This is the reason why I give it four stars instead of five.

That being said, this is an interesting, well made historical film telling a story about times and places virtually unknown in the West and doing it quite well indeed. This is the reason why I am going to keep this DVD for a possible future viewing and why I recommend it to all amateurs of historical films and medieval adventures.

8431302,4,B004IWXPPS,"Just baptised, Kiev Russia expands powers by Grand Prince Vladimir's son Yaroslav, nicknamed WISE while the later Grand Prince of the Whole Kiev Russia, on the eastern outskirts of a country, on The Volga banks.

Produced in contemporary post-communist Russia, this work impressed with depicting Prince Yaroslav as a sort of a traditional folklore hero, a bogatyr (strong iron man-fighter) from bylin (half-real half-imaginal tales of the past) annihilating pagan gods and delighting new subjects with Christian believes.

Good looking actors and matching the Medici intrigues make this movie quite educative and interesting in spite brief English subtitles.",1364256000,2,658,5.704081632653061

A Great movie about early Russia of a 1000 years ago with realistic costumes for the era, I was able to see the very same movie with the alternate title ""Iron Lord"" which has English subtitles.

If you like action movies this is a good one lots of sword fighting and it is basically a true story.

When Yaroslav grew up his father, the grand duke, sent him to rule the principality of Rostov to bring law an order to the unruly area and to collect the taxes, and add more territory to expand the tax base. The movie is about Yaroslav's adventures driving the slave traders and bandits out of the area and his capture by the Meria Tribe after being wounded by an arrow. He eventually talks the Meria tribe into being his vassals and tax payers. The arrow wound he receives in the movie was confirmed to be true when his remains, which are in a church in Kiev, were examined he had an arrow wound in the arm.

After Yaroslav became the Grand Duke he married the daughter of the king of Sweden and married his children into many royal houses of Europe. One daughter became the queen of France, one daughter the queen of Hungary, one daughter the queen of Norway, one of his sons married the daughter of the Byzantine Emperor  and one of his grandsons married the daughter of Harold Godwinson the last Saxon King of England who was killed in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Today there are 25 million people who are his decedents.",1337644800,3,1686,5.028673835125448
