8017072,5,B0001WTVCU,"Brian Dennehy can be proud indeed of his directoral efforts in this TV film, originally entitled, ""The Rape of Richard Beck"". Richard Crenna's tour de force performance as a police officer transformed during a midlife crisis won him a much deserved Emmy and showcased the broad range of his talent. Long recognized for his versatile dialect skills, his Boston accent was impeccable.  He commented in his Video Archive at emmys.org that he was very proud of this film. Incredibly, the whole movie was shot in just 19 days!
  Crenna's portrayal of an officer reassaigned to a sex crime unit provides some intensly chilling drama. A realistic depiction of a specific sex crime is unusual for TV. While not breaking any code or standard, some of the squeemish may be offended.
  Unfortunally, the rebranding of this film by Universal Music & Video Distribution for DVD as ""Deadly Justice"" has led to some confusion as to the contents of the film.
  Somehow many retailers are falsely representing and shipping the 2004 DVD as ""A Case of Deadly Force,"" another fine Crenna TV movie in which he portrays a cop-turned lawyer who suies a corrupt unit of the Boston Police Department. In that film several officers were involved in an execution-style murder of an innocent black man. It was based on a real case and names the principal characters.
  ""A Case of Deadly Force"" was once available on VHS & Laserdisc, but has not yet been distributed in DVD form.",1130889600,4,1450,4.838056680161944
8017073,1,B0001WTVCU,"This is not a Jack Reed film of Brian Dennehy's. If that's what you think you're getting, save your money. It is a Richard Crenna film without a sight of Brian Dennehy to be had.",1093219200,6,178,4.114285714285714
