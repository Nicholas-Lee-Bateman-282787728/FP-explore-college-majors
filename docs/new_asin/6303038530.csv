547862,5,6303038530,"First off, this isn't a review--it's a reminiscence. I saw this film in the '60s in Berkeley, and I loved it then partly because it spoke to me of what I believed were the issues of the day--freedom (artistic and  otherwise) and the power of the individual. I am now buying the video so  that I can at long last have a joyous reunion with the unforgettable  characters--the artist's dishevelled, indignant and loyal girlfriend; his  equally dishevelled, adoring and unquestioning young admirer, and the  artist himself, the outrageous Gully Jimson (Guinness). I still see his  raffish little boat on the Thames, chugging along to the regal strains of  Prokofiev, just as the often obnoxious and stubborn Jimson is dignified by  the strength of his commitment to art and self.

548392,5,6303038530,"""The Horse's Mouth,""(1958), is another brisk comic masterpiece of English cinema from the 1950's; a particularly rare one, as it is in color.  It stars the hugely talented Alec Guinness, who led a number of these comedic achievements (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ladykillers/dp/B00006FMAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ladykillers</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kind-Hearts-and-Coronets-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000CS45S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kind Hearts and Coronets - Criterion Collection</a>), as well, of course, as many serious films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridge-on-the-River-Kwai/dp/B00004XPPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Trilogy/dp/B001EN71DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Trilogy</a>).  In this particular case, ""Horse's Mouth,"" Guinness also wrote the film for the screen, adapting it from the Joyce Cary novel of the same name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Horse-s-Mouth-A-Novel/dp/B000YSSG6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Horse's Mouth: A Novel</a>).  It was directed by Ronald Neame, (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odessa-File/dp/B000031EGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odessa File</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poseidon-Adventure/dp/6305280746/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poseidon Adventure</a>) who had a lovely light touch; it received one Oscar nomination.

It tells us of Gulley Jimson, obsessed painter always searching for the perfect realization of his artistic vision, scamming and riding roughshod over those unfortunates in his way as he goes.  He receives sterling support from Kay Walsh as Coker, a friend/girlfriend, Renee Houston as Sara Monday, his ex-wife; and Mike Morgan, who died too young, at twenty-eight, ten days before the end of filming, so that his last lines had to be dubbed, as Nosey, a fervent young admirer.  The young Michael Gough plays Adam, a sculptor/cohort.  As Guinness wrote the part of Jimson for himself, he did, of course, tweak it a bit to make the artist more likable; and give him a better cinematic end.  The film makes remarkable use of Lieutenant Kije, by Sergei Prokofiev, as its sound track.  It was filmed at Shepperton Studios, Surrey; and on location in London: it gives us an equally remarkable picture of the then-contemporary city, still showing its war wounds. The color, so rarely used in 1950s British comedies, has been well-remastered; sound, too, is bright.

So why is it so undeservedly obscure?  Same reason, I theorize, as it is in color: it was made not by Ealing Studios, (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ealing-Studios-Comedy-Collection-The-Maggie-A-Run-for-Your-Money-Titfield-Thunderbolt-Whisky-Galore-Passport-to-Pimlico/dp/B0007LPSFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ealing Studios Comedy Collection (The Maggie / A Run for Your Money / Titfield Thunderbolt / Whisky Galore! / Passport to Pimlico)</a>), so famous for its 1950s black and white English comedies, but by the upstart Knightsbridge Films.  And who knows what that was all about, but it certainly has resulted in the film's being little-known.",1249516800,2,3448,7.723350253807107
548393,2,6303038530,"Having been a reader of the novel The Horse's Mouth for the past fifty= years, I came to the file with high expectations of seeinga version of what I had been imagining over the years. Guinness' work had always been first class and I expected him to do a decent job of Gulley Jimson and Cary's story. Disappointment! The film is a travesty of the story and I was unable to sit through the whole film.

Two stars for the photography, none for the acting.",1247097600,4,453,4.329411764705882
548394,4,6303038530,"I was recommended this movie by some friends of mine who share my obsession with the cinema.  It was one of those comedies they said I just needed to see, for even if it's not perfect (which it isn't), when it hits its mark it is better than most.  I have to say that I agree with that statement.  The film isn't always as smooth as it should be, but in the moments where everything comes together there can be found such stellar perfection one cannot help but adore the film in its entirety.  Sometimes we have to take the bad with the good and hope that the good outweighs the bad.

Thankfully, the good here FAR outweighs any bad.

The film casts Alec Guinness is what may be the role of his career.  As gravelly voiced painter Gully Jimson, Guinness is at the top of his comedic game, crafting a character that is memorable and completely entertaining.  Jimson, recently released from jail, returns to find his house boat in shambles.  He's in need of some quick cash, and when his attempts at getting paid for his paintings (which he feels were stolen from him by his ex-wife and unfairly sold) backfires on him he winds up shacking up in the penthouse of a wealthy couple on holiday and completely destroying their home while trying to create his masterpiece.

The films construction can feel a little uneven at times, and be forewarned that this is a very British movie so if that humor is not to your taste you may find yourself none-to-interested here (case in point, my father hated this movie).

But, there is also so much to love here.  The performances are all so rich, especially from Guinness and his female co-stars.  Kay Walsh is delightful as Miss Coker.  Her adoration and dire frustration with Gully is beautiful to watch, and she matches her every emotional connection with a humor that is undeniably engaging.  I also loved what Renee Houston did with her character, that of Gully's ex-wife Sara.  She just grabbed hold of her character and gave her such a vivacious personality.  I couldn't stop watching her.  Of course, this movie BELONGS to Guinness, but these two hilarious ladies surely helped out a lot.

Another big help was the script, penned by Guinness and adapted from the novel by Joyce Cary.  It's funny and charming and engaging throughout.  I have not read the novel, but I hear the ending is a deviation.  I have to say that the ending works very well, but I cannot say if I would have preferred the original ending since I don't know what it is.

In the end I highly recommend this movie.  It is not the perfect comedy, but it is a delightful treat with some great performances and it will truly stay with you for some time; and you can say you heard that straight from the horse's mouth.",1240963200,3,2728,4.520408163265306

548399,5,6303038530,"I bitterly regret that I completely missed seeing or even hearing about this movie until fifty years after it came out.  All the movie critics and pundits I have listened to for all those years should hang their heads in shame. This movie belongs in every top twenty list and many top tens.  I only found it by accident while browsing through my Netflix recommendations, but I am so glad I picked it.
I hope that Charlie Chaplin had a chance to see this movie while he was still alive because it has all the qualities that make for great slapstick.  The hero bounces from one hilarious situation to another while spouting a mixture of witty sarcasm, profound wisdom, and general grumbling about the unfairness of the world.  Only a great comic genius could have found a way to pack such a tremendous comic effect into the three words ""let it go"". This triggers the drop of a six foot cube of marble through the floor of the heroes borrowed studio (borrowed without the owners knowledge). This is quickly capped when the hero says that the people who live down there are in another country.  The crazy sculptor who ordered the marble says, ""That's okay then, I'll work down there."", throws his tools down the hole, grabs a ladder, and descends.  He then spends the next six weeks carving the monstrous chunk of marble into a statue standing all of three feet tall. This sets us up for that wonderful effect of three people disappearing into a hole in the carpet, taking the carpet with them.
But, I think that only a comic of Chaplins caliber could have conceived the heroes final act of self-sacrifice, when to save others from guilt, he destroys his greatest masterpiece himself, then sails off down the Thames in a leaky old houseboat that is sure to sink before it reaches the sea.  We are not too sad at this ending, because we know that there is no way that this crusty old curmudgeon is going to go down with the ship. He will find a way to survive and work even more havoc with the English art world.
It is interesting to know that only two people read the book and saw it as a movie. The first was Claude Raines.  He showed the book to the director, who read some of it and said there was no movie in it.  He later said the same thing to Alec Guiness, but Alec said, ""you're absolutely wrong."" and proceeded to write the screenplay.  Thus we have both a master work of the comic actors trade, and a masterwork of screenwriting from the hand of the same genius, a feat worthy of the great Chaplin himself.
If you like Alec Guinness, you'll love this movie.  If you love comedy, you'll love this movie.  If you love Art, you'll want to watch this movie over and over.  This is truly a great classic movie.
And, There's a bonus. The producers of this disc located and included the short film, Daybreak Express, which proceeded the movie in American theatres.  This little piece, set to music of Duke Ellington, is a perfect little gem.  Too short for a disc of its own, it's worth renting this disc in order to see it.  The music alone is wonderful, but the way the director cut the film to match the music is a cinematic tour de force delightful to behold.  considering the limited resources of the film maker, it's a minor miracle.",1199404800,2,3238,4.451776649746193

548522,5,6303038530,"""The Horse's Mouth"" is one of those British comedies that will bring a smile to your face if you already love those kind of movies and television shows, and is an indispensible DVD for fans of the great Alec Guinness.  He plays Gulley Jimson (who the novel's author, Joyce Cary, based on his friend the poet Dylan Thomas.)  Jimson is a broken-down, scabrous old reprobate of an artist, who is also recognized by those in the know as a genius.  Dressed in shabby old clothes, Guinness scowls, sneers, growls in an unforgettable voice, insults everyone, and schemes and plots his next big painting.  He is supported by Nosy, a young would-be artist, and Coker, a tough old barmaid who likes Jimson in spite of herself.  Jimson worms his way into the apartment of an upper-crust couple to paint his mural on their wall ""The Resurrection of Lazarus"", with hilariously catastrophic results.  While fleeing from the police, Jimson discovers a bare wall in an old church scheduled for demolition, and Tom Sawyer-like, recruits an army of apprentices to paint his next big mural, ""The Last Judgement.""

Guinness wrote the screenplay, and it has been criticized by some for softening the novel, especially the ending.  But this movie is a perfectly reasonable interpretation that perhaps reflects Guinness' religious faith (check out the titles of the paintings, Coker's prayer, and Jimson's last line in the film.)  Some have described Gulley as a sort of proto-hippie, but there is nothing soft, sentimental, or utopian about him.  He is a tough-minded, self-critical anarchist whose faith in another world besides this one, ""the world of color"", carries him through his troubles.  Jimson stands for the incorrigible individual against the small-minded materialistic elites that hate and fear real beauty because they have a hard time understanding it.

548523,5,6303038530,"I love this movie just as I remember liking the book as a child.  Guinness is wonderful, as is everyone.  Rather than just appear in the know and echo that Guinness wrote the screenplay I would like to say that it is brilliant and subtle and bawdy by turns and that I had no idea he was so gifted.  Also rather than just seem erudite I would like to say that the Prokofiev background was a good idea gone wrong.  It was exciting for a while, but it got old.  There is more to that suite than the snippet they eternally played.  And (my erudition) the suite was derived from the score to a movie.  I liked the human element the best.  I did not care for (I'd seen the movie before and almost didn't buy it for this reason) the marble through the floor or the fate of the last wall painted.  I liked the dialogue and the characterizations.  It is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.  The ending was not from the novel (as someone pointed out, I'd of course forgotten that), and just knowing that made me dislike it.  I don't know why the discovery should have had that effect on me.  I accepted the ending to begin with.  Finally, and by the by, when I was in the military I knew a Gulley Jimson.  He dabbled in art and knew no bounds.  However, he had no talent, was selfish beyond belief (and Gulley?) and was a child abuser (of the mean variety, not sexual), his own daughter.  So much for him.  Guinness was much more colorful (like the movie) and loveable.  A self-willed little grouch, but loveable.",1146182400,2,1524,4.28421052631579
548524,5,6303038530,"Gulley Jimson is an unappreciated painter, loopily passionate about his art, and defiantly inured to the rigors of poverty & the fear of giving offense.
""The Horse's Mouth"" wears its 45 years effortlessly.  We are fortunate that Alec Guinness poured his unique talents into imagining the genius of this comic character, getting it down as a screenplay, and rendering so inspired a performance.  The result defies imitation.  Intelligent viewers will find the comedy as delightfully quick as it must have been when it was first shown.
The Criterion Collection DVD has preserved the Technicolor gorgeously.  We are spared the customary tedium of ""DVD filler"" but given a wonderful short interview with director Ronald Neame.",1064016000,7,722,5.307017543859649
548525,5,6303038530,"If a film buff askes you to name a  classic film you realy like you can do no worse than to answer ""The Horse's Mouth"". Try to suppress a smile as the buff looks at first puzzled and then cautiously admits that they have never heard of let alone seen that movie so can it be that good?
Well actually yes it is explain to them then casually mention that it is the only film that Alec Guinness ever wrote a screenplay for and that he gained an Academy Award nomination for his trouble and that in his ""Parkinson"" interview in 1977 he almost (but not quite) admitted that it was his favourite film in his long career.
Then you can go on to tell that it is one of the few films from the 1950's that shows London in colour and the music adapted from Sergei Prokofieff's ""Lieutenant Kije"" gives the film a touch of class and a unique sense of style not to be found in other films of the period.
You may then mention that the acting is superb; as well as Guinness' faultless study of an obsessive and slightly desturbed artist Gulley Jimson.  Kay Walsh(Mrs. David Lean)adds humour and pathos as Miss Coker the comugenly woman who none the less has a soft spot for Jimson and music hall turn Renee Houston as Sara Munday (Gulley's ex-wife) adds a bit of bawdy fun to the proceedings. Young actor Mike Morgan gives an energetic perfomance all the more sad because he died before the film's release.
As the discussion continues you may point out that there are a few technical problems; the original three strip Technicolour camaras were so heavy, with their sound blimps, that the camera doesn't move that much during dialoge shots but that makes the actors move more especially when Gulley and Coker are escaping from the police .  Also because the film was assembled onto one roll of negative (a common practice in British films until the 1960's )the dissolves are a bit klunky.  But any discerning viewer will forgive such imperfections like the bullet holes in a Jimson painting.
You can then round off your discourse by stating that the end of the film, when Jimson sets sail in his wreck of a boat (a metaphor for his own body?), to find something new to paint is sublime.
Then if the film buff is still a bit bemused you can tell them that there is an excellent DVD of the film including an interview with director Ronald Neame and a D.A. Pennebacker Short that accompanied the film on it's original release from Criterion and that no serious DVD collection should be with out it and that comes, as they say, from the horse's mouth.",1060560000,99,2530,4.46969696969697
548526,5,6303038530,"I saw this movie with Spanish subtitles for the first time in 1964 as I turned ten years old. It was shown in a public channel in Puerto Rico. That was my first contact with Art in general.
 As I watched the movie I realized that I identified strongly with the artist character played by  Alec Guiness. Eveything seemed so cool about him.
 I also loved the image of the sculptor wearing the long scarf and creating an abstract image as he worked inspired by a nude female model.
 My whole life was tranformed at the end of this movie. I was only ten years old but I was decided to be myself like the artists in the movie. Sure enough I became an artist painter!
I travelled the world and lived in Paris for ten years.
After all those years I still trace the root of my artistic life to that wonderful and providential film.
It  amazes me how powerful and influential
the art of Cinema could be.",1059177600,5,894,4.266272189349112
548527,5,6303038530,"I recently purchased this film from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) plus four others: The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Captain's Paradise (1953), and The Ladykillers (1955). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.

This film is based on a novel by Joyce Cary, The Horse's Mouth. Guinness wrote the screenplay which was nominated for an Academy Award. The director was Ronald Neame who also produced it. Special credit should also be given to the cinematographer, Arthur Ibbetson, who brilliantly captures the beauty of London while sustaining the viewer's focus on both the splendor and squalor of Gulley Jimson's passions. For me, Guinness' portrayal of that aging and impoverished but obsessed painter gives a whole new meaning to the word ""eccentric."" As in the novel, the spirit of William Blake is very evident. Art is Jimson's religion for which he is not only willing but eager to make whatever sacrifices may be necessary, his or another's. There are both lambs and tigers in Blake's world and, indeed, in Jimson's world. As portrayed by Guinness, he manifests the dominant characteristics of both lion and lamb in his own personality and behavior.

Members of the supporting cast are outstanding, notably Mike Morgan (Nosey) and Kay Walsh (Coker) who remain devoted to Jimson throughout his constant use and abuse of them. I hasten to add that, after recently watching this bittersweet film again, I found its several comic moments hilarious. The best of Guinness' comic films always include special ""touches"" which enrich their appeal. Whether it was his idea or Neame's (or theirs together), clever use is made of Sergei Prokofiev's ""Lieutenant Kije"" suite throughout the film. I am unable to explain why so few people who claim to be ""film buffs"" know about this classic...nor why even fewer people have seen it.",1056499200,32,1970,4.984802431610942

Mr. Jimson is fully aware of the monetary difficulty for an artist, but it does not concern him.  After an incident with a previous buyer, he meets the Beeder's who want to buy a painting from him.

548529,5,6303038530,"Rarely seen and not widely known by the new generation of videophiles, ""THE HORSE'S MOUTH"" is a recent and most welcome arrival on DVD.
The late, great Alec Guinness was at the peak of his considerable powers when he wrote and starred in this wondrous screen adaptation of Joyce Carey's novel about the eccentric, driven, eremitic painter Gulley Jimson.  Widely acclaimed as one of cinema's greatest comic characters, Guinness' scruffy, gravelly-voiced and ill-behaved Jimson is also an unusually perceptive examination of the process of artistic creation and the fine line between the hallucinations of a madman and the inner visions of a genius.  Or, in Jimson's case, perhaps there is no dividng line at all.  Jimson lets nothing stand in his way as he searches for the perfect canvas. In this case, he needs a giant wall-size space for an epic mural of feet and toes in all their gnarly glory.  And when Jimson explains his vision, citing the worn, torn lizard skinned feet of Job, it makes sense.  And we fearfully root for him when he nearly destroys a stranger's luxury apartment to realize his dream.  Unsaid is the notion that because Jimson is a creator, he is most like God and ordinary rules do not apply.
Director Ronald Neame, in a 2001 interview (an extra on the disc), recalls that Carey's novel was originally brought to him by actor Claude Rains, but Neame thought it unfilmable.  When Guinness later suggested the same title to Neame as a project for himself, Neame said the same thing and Guinness replied, ""Ronnie, you're quite wrong,"" and went off and wrote the screenplay, expanding the novel's ending.
Greatly enhancing Jimson's mindset is the memorable music adapted from Prokfiev.  The original art seen in the film is by John Bratby, a leading proponent of UK's ""provincial realism"" school.  The lush digital transfer was supervised by Neame himself.  Also Included on the disc are vintage trailers and D. A. Pennebaker's ""Daylight Express,"" the Duke Ellington scored short that played prior to ""The Horse's Mouth"" in its theatrical run.
This is a comic masterpiece that belongs on the shelf with ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Withnail & I.""  Highest recommendation.",1024617600,4,2187,4.964383561643835

Maybe in the late '50s this passed as smart comedy with something to say about making art (I'm an artist and this didn't connect at all). The supporting roles are broadly played and the situations (such as the lowering of the marble slab) came across like something out of The Beverly Hillbillies. Alec Guinness' acting, however, is really fine and nuanced. That said, I found his character so unappealing and unfunny, I couldn't really enjoy this masterful performance.
