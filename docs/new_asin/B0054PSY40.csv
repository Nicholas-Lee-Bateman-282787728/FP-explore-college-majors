4570354,5,B0054PSY40,"I had the Honor of attending a screening of this movie with Master Li PENG and a few of his American Students Months ago. Master LI PENG is a 32nd Generation Shaolin Fighting Monk, who taught kung fu here in America and Abroad for many years after being a featured performer in a  Shaolin traveling troupe. It would be well worth your time to google him and learn more about this soon to be well known Kung Fu Star. Make sure you can say, ""I have his first Movie in my collection"" in the years to come.

4570356,2,B0054PSY40,"A very B movie. The acting is terrible. The martial arts fights are really awesome, but that is offset by the comfort of the main character in delivering lines. If you don't mind bad acting to see some amazing martial arts choreography, then this is a good movie. If the plot is important, maybe not.",1482796800,,300,4.472727272727273

4570368,5,B0054PSY40,"WOOHOO!!! Finally, a movie and a main character that can rival Jackie Chan! This was incredible! You won't find better acting than this in a Jean Claude That'sBad movie, or Steven Seagull. They must have spent moments perfecting the fight scenes to make them look so realistic. I know I can take at least 27 hits to the face before it hurts! Even I could lose a fight if all I had to do was wait for the main character to catch his breath and defeat the 13 other people. And the acting was.so. awe. some. It's unfortunate that the script writer, editor, director, and personal assistants were still in high school.",1477785600,,614,4.491071428571429

There is too much good stuff to watch to waste time with something like this. The acting was worse than community theater, the dialog was painful, the DP had a few decent moments, but overall ""Why are we watching this?"" was the mantra.",1477612800,,342,4.444444444444445
4570370,2,B0054PSY40,My personal tastes - the overall storyline - good triumphs over bad - I like. But lead actor is not attractive. the acting in general is terrible.

4570385,3,B0054PSY40,"The plot is alright--most kung fu movies deal with either crime, school related issues, or a villain challenger. There were a few times during the film that I had the thought to stop watching because it was just painfully awkward to watch, but I suppose it works to a degree seeing as the main character is completely unfamiliar with modern American life. I stuck through the film, and have to say that the choreography is pretty good. The monk himself kinda reminds me of a pudgy Jet Li (haaaa, a Jet Li reference is made in the film).

Ultimately, optimistically, it was a decent film.",1474329600,,587,4.59047619047619

As the movie continued, I discovered that every actor/actress could not act.  The storyline continued and became even more unbelievable.  He doesn't act like someone who grew up in a monastery in China.  The fight scenes were poorly coordinated to the point where each punch looked fake.

The movie ""Last Kung Fu Monk"" has the best fighting scenes Ive ever viewed. Having studied Kung Fu for 20 years and been a personal student under him I can say this martial artist is second to none above the best in the world. Thus these are a must see!

4570497,1,B0054PSY40,"This one of the worst Kung Fu movies I've seen. Considering the genre, that's actually saying quite a bit. This is one movie that shouldn't have been in english. If it had been in a language I couldn't understand and the dialogue was captioned, it might have been better. The acting was stiff and uncomfortable from most of the actors. Kristen Dougherty does a decent job, but that was the exception. If you're making a kung fu movie, you can get away with a lot of things; bad acting, bad plot, bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad costumes/set, and even bad directing, but the one thing you can't really have if you didn't excel in one of the other areas is.. bad action/choreography.

This movie's action seemed more on the order of a collage project for a drama group trying to get extra credit. Most of the fight scenes had many blows that were so obviously pulled as to not get within 6-10"" of the opponent. It was like watching a run through prior to the cameras rolling. I can not think of another movie I've seen with action this fake. The old TV show Knight Rider had better fight sequences than this. Thinking back, I can't even think of a TV show with action this stilted, and I've seen a lot.

In reading through this review, I am trying to think of something positive to say about the movie. Ah! I thought of one. If you are having to research any of the staff or cast of this movie to produce a report, you have here a prime example of one bad product they took part it. That's as good as I can come up with.

Story line must have been stolen from some video arcade game from the 80's. Character development was lacking. Acting was horrible. Continuity, timing and transitioning were abysmal.

Plus several scenes seem forced as if the character had no purpose to actually be there talking. There were a few scenes that just did not need to exist. The acting was terrible but I believe that was in part due to poor directing. I just think the director was in over their head not knowing how to get the right amount of emotion from his actors to create the right feeling or mood from the scenes.

4570586,2,B0054PSY40,"This is one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long time.  I was rooting for it to be over.  Why is it so bad?  Before I answer that let me briefly give you the plot:

A Shaolin monk comes to New York to raise his nephew after his brother and wife were killed in some accident.  A pretty, young social worker helps him to make the transition as he is a fish out of water.  A former student of the monk's convinces him to open up a school and then the monk ends up in a variety of fights, most brought on by his friend who is in deep with a loan shark, and fights some nutcase in a backroom warehouse in order to save his pupils.

Now back to why it's so bad.  (1) The acting is stultifyingly horrendous and even painful to watch at times.  The only people who get a ""pass"", barely, on the acting front are the attractive social worker (played by Kristen Dougherty) and the postal delivery officer who is on screen all of 30 seconds.  Sometimes the acting is so bad it's funny.  Here, it is simply so bad it hurts.  (2) The fight choreography leaves a lot, and I mean a whole lot, to be desired.  It is obvious that our lead, Peng Zhang Li, is himself an actual martial artist but he seriously lacks charisma and his talent doesn't translate to the screen in this effort.  Also, there are several groan inducing instances where he could have been slashed to death as fighters waited their turn as he beats up their comrades before they step in to get beat up.  How kind of them.  (3) Blech!  The ""romance""!  Li's nephew's social worker falls for him and it doesn't feel real in the least.  Within the first ten minutes of the movie I told my wife, ""They better not put these two together.  They don't fit.""  But of course they did.  (4) It would be kind to say that the direction lacks crispness and that the script lacks polish.  I'll leave it at that.

So why didn't I give this a one star as so many others (rightfully) have?  Maybe because the derivative plot (that's really not a criticism when it comes to a kung fu movie) tries to overreach and I can appreciate that.  Maybe because it tries to channel Jackie Chan and ""Bloodsport"".  Maybe because in one fight scene in a warehouse with lots and lots (and I mean lots) of big, empty cardboard boxes and a forklift there was a moment that made me recall a bit of ""Rumble In the Bronx"".  Maybe because, though it is a lousy movie, it's not entirely unwatchable.  Maybe.  My advice to you if you haven't seen it yet but have determined to watch it for some reason after reading this review?  Invite some friends over for a party and have fun mocking the movie.  Turn the volume off and pick characters and put words in their mouths.  Do this and you'll thank me.  Otherwise, don't say that I didn't warn you.",1346544000,3,2766,4.245681381957773
4570587,1,B0054PSY40,"Totally agree with one star ranking.  In fact, people should get a refund.  Lead actor is wooden, support actors look like students, back ground sets are poor; kung action are much better in OTHER movies....skip this one!!!!",1338076800,,224,5.027027027027027

Other than the few flashback clips, there is nothing that would convince me that this guy really is or has ever been a monk.
Pretty decent martial arts choreography at times, but that's where the talent ends (I guess that's why I fell asleep twice 15 min into the movie). The rest was just a big disappointment,Silly and awful acting,Very long and boring periods between the action.  Terrible script. It seems like they played the same crappy background music through the whole film, it's more like a martial arts soap opera, If I had a choice of watching this movie again, or having my toenails ripped from my flesh, I'd opt for the latter.",1332892800,12,811,4.631944444444445
4570590,5,B0054PSY40,"Since I have been watching movies from the Mainland of China for a decade, I find ""Last Kung Fu Monk"" one of the most fascinating movies of this Millennium.

The plot is full of touchable moments and focuses on the trials and tribulations of the leading role Li Long.

Li Long is a master of the martial arts, a former Shaolin Monk and an immigrant in the city of New York.

Li Long is in taking care of the child of his deceased brother. To make money, Li Long opens a dojo with a friend named Dave, to teach the local inhabitants the art of Shaolin Kung Fu.

However, the individuals that have given Li Long the money to make this school are less than savory. Trying to force Li Long into a brutal world of underground fighting, members of the Russian mafia kidnap two students of Li Long and now he must fight in their club to save them.

The storyline of the Last Kung Fu Monk is well paced and has plot elements that follow nicely from the rest of the genre's films.

The action sequences are stunning, with a proper amount of downtime present in between each. The Last Kung Fu Monk may just be the one kung fu flick that individuals should purchase on DVD.

The quality is there, acting and action is perfect, and one will be on the edge of their seat the entire time.

A colorful and interesting movie to watch that I recommend to all viewers who wants experience from a different Asian movie style.",1332460800,,1406,4.319391634980988
4570591,5,B0054PSY40,"It's a great film.

The story is a fish out of water tale mixed with a traditional martial arts film. The plot follows a Monk who leaves his temple in China to travel to New York in order to parent his nephew after the boy's parents died in a car accident. Once in America the Monk and a former student open a karate school that soon becomes a target for the ire of a local gang.

The contrast between Wushu and street fighting always is intriguing and there is no doubt that Li is a master, and the stunt men do a great job of making very exciting fight scenes.

Li Zhang is charming and has a very likeable personality.

If you like martial arts, go ahead and rent the movie",1332201600,,676,4.137404580152672

While I don't mind some scenes of a wild-eyed innocent in the big city struggling with umbrellas etc......the main character in this movie struggles with just about everything. His one skill is to yell ""Stop"" whenever he is ready to intervene when someone is being abused farther than he can stomach (and he lets it go on for awhile). Based from what we can gather in this flick...monks cannot wake up in time to see their ward off to school, wash clothes, pick up dirty dishes, relate to others and their favorite thing to make for dinner is a phone call to carry out. The fight scenes are nothing special and the plot is horrific to match the ""acting"". Each scene ends in a fade out so the new one can start (monks can't direct I guess either. My favorite unbeleivable plot lines stems from the female lead (""I quit my job with social services so I can help raise this pre-teen with this guy who can't even look me in the eye so I know he loves me although he comes from a culture where they don't interact with women and we won't need money once his school takes off that his idiot friend is in deep to some kind of gang for"".)You can pass on this...or buy my copy.",1326585600,9,1173,4.288288288288288
