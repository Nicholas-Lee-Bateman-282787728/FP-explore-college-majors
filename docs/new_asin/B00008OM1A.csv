You can see it at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Classic-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B002IJA66E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Classic Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>.  The covers and title are almost exactly the same, and so is the price.

The different films are: SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON, A STUDY IN SCARLET and THE SPECKLED BAND.

Just to be clear, the ""Ian Flemming"" listed on the cover is definitely not the same man who created James Bond.

These are all Public Domain films and have been released by numerous companies in various ways.",1274227200,3,741,6.019047619047619
1856693,1,B00008OM1A,The picture is so poor you can hardly make the characters out.  There must be a decent piece of film left somewhere. I never even finished watching it.,1255219200,15,151,4.392857142857143
1856694,4,B00008OM1A,"Like Sherlock Holmes? To be honest with you, I am quite the fan, so when I saw this set years ago, I picked it up knowing I would enjoy the four films contained within. This set is really nice if you like nice boxsets of the unique type. It has a nice over sized plastic box with some nicely done Holmes artwork done on the outside as well as the inside. It6 closes with magnets, which may sound odd, but it works very well for this set. The box really looks nice, just as good as the ""Classic Rarities"" set also released by Alpha Video.

The films in the set are; Dressed To Kill, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, Terror By Night and, The Woman in Green. Iy also may or may not include a bomus interview disc with Conan Doyle himself. Truthfully speakung, these are not the best transfers I have sen as these movies have finally been remastered and completely restored, but these transfers are very good. Unlike most of the horrible DVD's you find out there quality wise, especially in the discount discs, these transfers are fairly clean with little noise on the screen and generally free from most of the signs of age. Again, I am not saying they look like they have been remastered, but they di look nice and mostly clean. At least they aren't just ""Watchable"". I read that in reviews and cringe.

If you are a budget looking Sherlock Holmes fan that enjoys Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, this set is nice and worth the price of admission, especially since I paid quite a bit more than you are going to.",1221436800,6,1514,4.4035714285714285
1856695,5,B00008OM1A,"This is an excellent Sherlock Holmes collection. The sound is fantastic.
On so many remastered old films, words can sound jumbled up. Not this one. Basil Rathbone stars in, The Woman in Green, Terror By Night, Dressed to Kill with the lovable fumbling Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce-he was truly the one and only Dr. Watson). Arthur Wontner stars as SH in,
The Sign of Four, Triumph of SH and Murder at the Baskervilles.
Total running time: 6 hrs. and 54 min. at a very low, reasonable price.
This set is the best remastered one I have ever seen of any old film.",1201824000,22,555,4.450980392156863

7986048,4,B00008OM1A,"Sherlock Holmes Collection

This set contains four movies that were adapted from Sherlock Holmes stories. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote four long stories and fifty-six short stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading; especially when you are older. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon [1942] tells of a plot to steal a bombsight to aid a foreign power. Its four parts are produced in separate factories [as a security measure]. Will foreign agents be able to steal this secret weapon?

Sherlock Holmes and the Woman in Green [1945] tells about a number of unsolved murders. Holmes deduces the scheme but lacks evidence. He visits Lydia at her home then encounters danger. Can help arrive in time?

Terror By Night [1946] is about an expensive diamond which brings bad luck to its owner. Sherlock Holmes will guard it. There is a murder in a railway carriage, one of the passengers must be the murderer!

Dressed to Kill [1946] is about stolen music boxes. One has an engraved plate that can be used to print counterfeit 5 notes that cant be distinguished from genuine 5 notes! Can Sherlock Holmes recover the plates and catch the criminals?",1487203200,,1569,4.973282442748092
