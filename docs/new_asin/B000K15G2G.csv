8153844,5,B000K15G2G,I loved this and have bought the other movies Doug Jacobson has done! I think this is the best movie about Burning Man that I have seen and I would recommend it to anyone who has or has not been to Burning Man. The director has a way of making the viewer feel that he or she is taking the journey with everyone in the cast. This movie has inspired me to go and see for myself! What an interesting and artful movie. Tony Ghiselli,1310169600,,428,4.047058823529412
8153845,5,B000K15G2G,"When I 1st went to Burning Man in 08', I wanted to find a movie that truely shows what it's like preparing to goto BM and being there.",1289001600,,134,3.8214285714285716
8153846,5,B000K15G2G,"Whether you are a long time Burner, or just curious as to what goes on in the dessert, this is a great view of our ""home away from home"". Burning Man is never the same experience twice. This DVD is one camps collective view of their time at Black Rock City. Cuddled with my favorite Burner, we laughed through the entire movie.",1231200000,,327,4.290322580645161
8153847,1,B000K15G2G,"Any Burning Man experience from any year thus far has way more to offer than these guys ever considered bringing to the camera.

It seemed like most of the movie was the filmmakers interviewing themselves about Burning Man. All of that pointless crap should have been cut out of the movie! (Or, maybe just kept in this version for their mothers, who may never tire of their cute little faces.)

""Burning Man Festival-Special Edition"" by Joe Winston is a serious look at the real thing, and far more enjoyable.",1216684800,4,509,4.707865168539326
8153848,5,B000K15G2G,"I was one among the group of folks, peripherally, who were documented here. All I can say is that this documentary is a) an accurate reflection of the weird folks who do this weird thing, b) an accurate depiction of the sometimes dificult issues that erupt when chatotic groups try to attempt big things, and c) a whole tank of nitrous full of giggles.",1189900800,5,352,4.515625
8153849,5,B000K15G2G,"Of all the years I've been to Burningman, it's been hard to explain the experience to those who haven't. Journey to the Flames is the ideal documentary to help me with this mission! It takes you on a real ride of the true Burningman journey through the storylines of everyday people who create their own ""playa"" characters as they begin to explore themselves in such an extreme and playful environment.

This is a great DVD to give to friends and family who have wondered about what happens during those crazy 10 days- as well as a fun reminder to those who have gone... what a strange crazy trip it is.",1170028800,8,603,4.4818181818181815
8153850,5,B000K15G2G,"this was the most accessible, informational, and fun/quirky doc i've seen on burning man.  it's a hard topic to explain and this movie does such a good job of showing the many facets of the event.  it had a memorable blend of fun & entertainment with good information that convinced me to finally take the plundge and go to the festival after years of hearing about it.  it has great music, goofy & real characters, incredible visuals of the event,  strong background info, and the bonus features were amazing - especially the sky divers plunging into the temporary city of 40,000 people.  totally recommend it.",1164672000,9,611,4.780952380952381
8153851,5,B000K15G2G,"This documentary follows a group of close friends as they explore radical self-expression at the Burning Man festival at Black Rock City, Nevada.  Great music and camera work set this Burning Man documentary apart from others that have been released.  This one is filled with excitement and adventure as well as some hysterical moments -- those guys Jake and Steve are simply looney!  If you have ever been, are thinking about going, or are just curious about Burning Man, this is a great place to start.",1164672000,9,504,4.837209302325581
