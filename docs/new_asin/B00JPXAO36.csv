6388845,2,B00JPXAO36,"Somehow this film just misses the mark totally , it covers Alice from beginning to 1986 (what about the next 25+ years !?) and it does this poorly , we have all seen & heard most of these stories on ""Prime cuts"" ""behind the music "" etc.  They skip over so many era's & albums  that if your a big Alice fan your gonna be bummed with this .
  I love what Banger films usually put's out ( Iron Maiden: Flight 666 , Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage , history of metal series etc.)  but this is average at best .
  What someone needs to do is put out a 4 hour Alice film ( see the documentary stuff that was done on Tom petty or the Eagles) to cover 40+ years of an amazing career ....... the other bummer is certain past Alice cooper band members were not involved in this ..............overall i will probably never watch this again , if your a diehard your gonna be pretty bummed with most of it .",1402099200,14,893,4.0685714285714285
6388846,3,B00JPXAO36,"First off, this review pains me.  I have been an Alice Cooper fan since I was a teenager and have seen him live which never disappoints.  I am also a huge fan of Dunn and McFayden, having thoroughly enjoyed ""Flight 666"" and ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"".

Perhaps I just bought into all the hype that was sent to my email courtesy of Eagle Rock Entertainment.  I had missed out on the theater release of the film so I have been waiting months for it to come out on Bluray, in hindsight, it was probably better I did miss the theater release because I would not have bought the Bluray.  From the Eagle Rock email hype I was expecting a larger than life story with new footage I have never seen, new interviews and insight to the band, Vincent and Alice.  I was expecting the story and characters to come alive in the film but sadly that didn't happen for me.

Perhaps I am just too big of a fan, owning too many Alice bootlegs, buying the concert films over the years, reading a few biographies it seems I know the whole legacy inside and out already as I really didn't learn anything new from them but certainly noticed gaping holes in the story.  There is no mention of Vincent's contribution to his local community/school theater or his radio show. I just think the whole story isn't told here, I found myself disappointed.

The most enjoyable and enlightening part of the Bluray for me was the bonus interviews, that is where I did learn some interesting bits and heard some different points of view I hadn't been exposed to before.

I ended up watching the film twice, the first time was kind of late at night and I fell asleep around the time of Special Forces so the next night I watched again and saw that after SF there wasn't too much more in the film, having the story end shortly after ""The Nightmare Returns"".  Alice has had some great hits, darn good albums, fantastic tours since then but there was no mention of his successes.

Feeling empty after watching this film for the second time I went to Netflix where I have been watching some outstanding Rock Docs and settled in and completely enjoyed the 5 star films that are ""Beware of Mr Baker"" and ""Muscle Shoals"" which accomplished for those artists what this film should have done for Alice.  In the end, I feel that if you really want to get the best insight to Alice and his contribution to popular music, get the DVD of ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" and watch it with the commentary track on.

I certainly hope Dunn and McFayden can return to excellent rock doc film making, they have a great knack for telling interesting rock stories but even with one of the greatest performers EVER, this documentary simply falls flat.",1402012800,36,2685,4.486652977412731
6388847,1,B00JPXAO36,"If you are buying this deluxe edition of Super Duper Alice Cooper for the bonus disc of the ""1972 Concert"" BEWARE - it's cut to shreds.... Something they should have told me/everyone in the description! Don't advertise a full concert when the footage/songs/audio is incomplete. Don't misunderstand me, if you see the track list you can tell it's not the full concert set list; but the songs they did include are incomplete! Why do I need to see/hear a chopped to shreds ""I'm Eighteen""?? Why do I need to sheel out my hard earned cash for the last 2 minutes of ""Is It My Body""???? Why would I want to hear the first 4 bars of ""Yeah Yeah Yeah"" and not the rest of the song???? I feel ripped off. If you feel that this would cheat you too, then do yourself a favor and just get the documentary where incomplete songs are the norm, don't shell out for an incomplete concert.

Please note that this is no reflection on Amazon, who's service is always excellent.",1401926400,44,956,4.431818181818182
6388848,5,B00JPXAO36,"This documentary was an absolute revelation!  The early footage, interviews, and stories were worth the price of admission all by themselves.  This is about as honest a look at Alice Cooper as you can possibly get and it REALLY shows you the highs and tremendous lows of his life and career.  You won't look at Alice Cooper the same way after you see this, as you will gain an immense amount of respect for his recovery and triumph over, strangely enough, Alice.

It is so great to see the story of Alice Cooper told against the backdrop of the time when they (the band) were starting out.  It is so easy to dismiss what they did if you don't put it into context and this documentary will show you exactly why Alice Cooper (and later the solo act ""Alice Cooper"") were and are so important to the history of theatrical music.

The production on the Blu-ray is great, as the guys behind two other amazing documentaries (""Iron Maiden - Flight 666"" and ""Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage"") were behind this one.  They know their subject and they work with the people to deliver amazing pieces of work and I cannot recommend any of their films highly enough.

BOTTOM LINE: Super Duper Alice Cooper gets 10 stars out of 5!

6388850,5,B00JPXAO36,"Review no. 131. Fantastic / fact-filled documentary DVD about how the Alice Cooper Group right from the very start - leading up to the release of Uncle Alice's 1986 'Constrictor' lp release. Alice and original band bassist Dennis Dunaway does a splendid job of narrating this must-see DVD. Great job of directing as well as cinematography. Several re-editing with super-rare / previously never-before-seen photos, images, etc. Noticed that a good certain amount of this DVD that was spent on Alice's personal life (facts, that long-time followers - like myself didn't know). Have to wonder as to why guitarist Michael Bruce wasn't included in much of this DVD - I mean a single commentary by Bruce would've been nice.

6388853,5,B00JPXAO36,"This is a really good documentary about Alice. I did like the fact they didn't hold back on any aspects of Alice's life and career. I was a bit shocked about his cocaine use. And the visuals of the DVD are well done. The Ouija Board story isn't the actual story of how they got their name, but for the film it's more entertaining. I wish their was more live footage but what was here was great. I am a loyal Alice fan, (I did meet him in April in Orlando). And this makes the DVD more meaningful. I think Samm Dunn did a very good job at this film. If you don't know anything about Alice then this is the DVD to see. Nice job on the film!",1468108800,,638,3.953488372093023

6388860,3,B00JPXAO36,"A lot of reviews and I mean a lot of reviews trashed this video for lack of content. For that reason is where this DVD falls short. This group started out as a band with a girls name. Without the involvement of all band members they should have dealt with Vince as a child and gone on to Welcome to my Nightmare to the present. If your going to ignore the band your ignoring the people that made Alice Cooper the figure. It was great that the cocaine addiction came to light as the behind the music special pawned it off as him falling of the wagon as he had a glass of wine at dinner with Cheryl and by midnight had two bottles of whiskey hidden in his room. You don't get that skinny drinking booze. As with a lot of fans during the Coke times he was reinventing the character and the out put of vinyl was daring, unique, and keeping with the times. And to leave out Brutal Planet is outrageous! This album put AC back into the limelight. I saw this show on opening night in Binghamton. Talk about an experience ranks right with WtmN. AC found his way out of the darkness which is fantastic s his demons are at rest, but the lack of band members during the glory makes this production fall flat.

6388880,3,B00JPXAO36,"I know some Alice Cooper fans will strike me down for giving this just three stars, but I think it is what it deserves. I don't want to be a slappy that just gives everything Alice has out five stars. It was interesting. I learned a lot about Alice Cooper in the beginning years, which was nice. I knew some of his past. I've lived in Michigan most of my life and knew of Alice Cooper. However, when he was at his height in the 1970s (his first peak), I was in my single-digit years, so I really didn't know that much of who he was except we all wanted to play School's Out on the last day of school.
If you are looking for something to detail his life up to the 1980s, this will do just fine. I just wish the DVD went a bit further than his Halloween comeback concert in Detroit (shown on MTV at the time). I would've liked to know more about the next couple decades after that concert. But it wasn't included, and for that I felt a little cheated. Why distribute a DVD about your life and leave the last 30 years or so out of the DVD? That was a tad bit upsetting.

6388886,5,B00JPXAO36,Nothing I can really add that other reviewers haven't already covered pretty well. I thought the actual documentary was very well done and for the casual fan probably extremely informative and entertaining. I'm sure for the die hards it's mostly a rehash of previously released info and footage but the way it's put together is what makes it worth it. Instead of watching a bunch of talking heads they let the photos tell the story while you hear from everyone from Mrs. Furnier to Bernie Taupin (and even a quick humorous quote from John Lydon). It's one of the better made documentaries I've seen and I wouldn't complain to see more done this way compared to the usual interviews strung together mixed with photos and live footage (although you get plenty of that here too). It was nice to see the extremely early footage used and the main focus to be mostly on the original band. The story pretty much ends in '86 though. While I've read and understand the filmmakers reasoning behind that decision it still would've been nice if they could've at least shown how his career peaked again around the Trash/ Hey Stoopid era and touched on what he's accomplished up to the current day. Still a very well done informative documentary and well worth the price offered here especially with the bonus footage and interviews included. *****,1422576000,2,1334,4.779220779220779

6388910,2,B00JPXAO36,"i'm glad other folks didn't hold back on their displeasure of this film. I was super stoked to see this for sale and after my vcr crapped the bed I have been unable to watch the decent 'alice cooper prime cuts' vhs tape. always this time of year I get more into cooper so I couldn't wait to throw this thing in the player...when it was over, I was disappointed to say the least.
for one, I was actually on edge watching this because not knowing the entire film was going to be done in voice overs, I was waiting to see someone talking one on one. it almost felt like you were watching home movies with no sound and someone in the background explaining what is happening. so annoying!!
the film chronicles the cooper gang and alice himself (actually, it's about 95% about alice himself). there is definitely some great old footage and information you may have not known before. what it fails to do is dig deep into the band or their records..infact, it barely mentions them by name. and what is even worse is that besides a little bit about dennis dunaway and neil smith, nothing much is mentioned of Michael bruce or glen buxton, and the fact that there was absolutely no mention of buxton's death is inexcusable, especially when at the end of the film there is a 'where are they now' kinda file, saying NOTHING of bruce and buxton...but mentioning Bernie taupin. Bernie taupin??!!  are you freakin kiddin me??
aside from early influence from the GTO's there is no mention as to how cooper came about his makeup designs or costumes. you could drive a hearse thru the holes in this film.
the movie ends it's history lesson up to coopers comeback in 86...with no mention to anything else after that. granted, his late 80s work isn't exactly mind blowing but it definitely deserves some recognition...not even the Wayne's world skit or mention of his excellent recent records such as dirty diamonds and the eyes of alice cooper.
alice the band and the man deserve so much better than this. i'd gladly watch 3 hours of alice if the film makers bothered to do a little more homework in the subject.
if you are a big fan, of course you are going to buy this. however, you are better off watching 'good to see you again, alice cooper', 'the nightmare returns', 'welcome to my nightmare' and of course, 'prime cuts'.  not what I expected. buy it used cheap",1413244800,6,2348,4.535377358490566

There were just too many gaps that were not covered.  It was difficult trying to keep track of who was talking.  The time periods and which albums and tours were vague.  There wasn't a single reference to Michael Bruce or any of the incredible talent that Alice has worked with since 1986.  He has had some of the best musicians in the world play on parts of his CD's and this wasn't covered.  Prime cuts was much more inclusive and entertaining.",1412121600,5,645,4.406779661016949

He has produced so much material, and done so many things for charity throughout the last 20 years, that it would take another couple of hours to properly review it.  They should come up with a sequel.  The man just keeps getting better and better.  His recent albums and tours have been TERRIFIC!  Just keeps getting better.",1411084800,,475,4.662650602409639

6388919,3,B00JPXAO36,"I've been following Banger Films for years now through their projects about Rock & Metal artist. Sam Dunn and his crew have done wonderful work paying tribute (and rightfully so!) to bands like Rush and Iron Maiden, as well as two other excellent films on Metal (Metal: A Headbanger's Journey is still a favourite, and Global Metal) and a TV series no less in the form of Metal Evolution. When they announced Super Duper Alice Cooper an Alice Cooper documentary l was excited, as l'm a massive fan of the man (and the band of course) and Banger Films have done tremendous work covering subjects l love.

I think l had hopes that it would cover Alice's entire career, but sadly it didn't. Some events are glossed over and the documentary would have you believe Alice Cooper never did anything after 1986 but touring. Now l get that with a man who had such a long and illustrated career it would have made for a perhaps overly long documentary project. For instance, his early 80's output, as out there and bizarre as it was is almost completely ignored here. Instead they focus on Alice's personal problems. It would have been nice to hear more about them and ask Alice (even though he doesn't remember them he can still share thoughts). Or why his Lace And Whisky album was such a brilliant album but a complete departure musically. It seems they mostly go for the surface without scratching underneath, therefore being a more appealing project to someone who isn't obsessed with Alice Cooper.

With that said, what they DO cover and what's in and the presentation is marvellous. I've already watched it five times. Some footage and interviews l had never seen and are a treat and insights of where Alice Cooper as a band was and who Vincent Furnier was (or becoming). One particular moment during an interview from about '81-'82 sees Furnier's descent in a downward spiral, both mentality and in appearance. Some of the footage paints very vivid and strong images of the band and Alice. The live footage is great, watching the band play, executions, Alice kissing girls.. There's a lot of stuff to captivate but maybe not as much for die-hard fans who may have seen (or know) it all already. The bonus interviews that didn't make the cut are certainly worth watching.

The storytelling is as good as it can possibly get, mostly done by Alice himself and the original band members as well as some guests and people who contributed (Bob Ezrin etc). Even though we may know the story it never gets old hearing it from those who lived it. The only downer is they have all the Alice Cooper band but Michael Bruce for some reason.

Most fans seem to absolutely love Super Duper Alice Cooper while a few seem to think it's lacking or doesn't tell them anything they don't already know. It think it falls short of being the definitive Cooper documentary but that it could have been close. One can assume that had Banger Films had more screen time (or a second disc) this could've been it. The documentary itself makes for great viewing and is very enjoyable. With all the animations (kinda reminded me of History of the Eagles and served to enhance the product) it really brought the story to life and were entertaining. I'm not going to go full marks here, it's worth watching but l can't deny that even though l enjoyed it, l anticipated more from Super Duper Alice Cooper. This time Banger Films went for a more traditional approach to filmmaking and used a lot of footage and voice over and ultimately it makes it less effective than their previous work, it doesn't have what made the other ones work so well. As much as l love Banger Films and Alice Cooper l'm giving this one a 3.5/5. Worth the admission but don't expect the world.

(On a side note, for those of you who may be curious l met Sam Dunn recently at an Alice Cooper show and had a chance to be interviewed and after l asked him what his next project was going to be and he said the next band planned is Soundgarden)",1409788800,2,3978,4.565826330532213

The viewer doesn't learn much about the other band members of the original Alice Cooper band, except that Alice was friends with them in high school. The same stories we've heard are told, such as meeting Bob Ezrin and Frank Zappa, how Alice was a threat to the peace and love movement, his drinking, and how he became Alice off the stage etc. The breakup of the original band was supposed to be interesting, but it was only a small part of the doc, and it still isn't clear why they broke up. It only explained why they didn't want to continue working with Ezrin. The cocaine use wasn't discussed as much as I thought it would be. I wasn't a fan of it only being a narration. They could have found people who saw Alice in the early days, and interviewed them.

I wanted to learn something about the band called Billion Dollar Babies who recorded one album after Vince Furnier went out on his own. Also, the documentary ends with his mid 1980's comeback.

Tons of great photos of the band while in their formative, pre-Zappa years, and plenty of stories from just about everyone involved - from surviving band members, to Shep Gordon, to one of the GTO's, to Alice's own mom.  It's all very imaginatively presented, and very much in spirit with Alice's way of looking at things.  The documentary really focuses more on the human drama of being in the band, as opposed to telling stories about the making of each specific album, but it's all pretty fascinating nevertheless.  Even the most jaded fan will probably find some jarring and uncomfortable revelations about Uncle Alice, but don't let that deter you - this really is a must-have.

6388949,5,B00JPXAO36,"This is one helluva documentary.  As a teenager, my favorite Alice Cooper albums were the ones between 1969 (Pretties for You) to 1973 (Muscle of Love).  We were all a little stoned back then but, I had no idea that ""Vincent Furnier"" actually went to hell and back.

As the documentary begins, if you're an Alice Cooper fan like I am, you'll reminisce over the Alice Cooper concerts that came to your town (I'm from Cincinnati and Alice Cooper played there a lot), buying the albums, maybe you didn't have Alice Cooper posters on your wall... I did.  I was hooked when I heard the first 4 guitar chords of Eighteen.  As far as I was concerned Alice Cooper was far deadlier than any of the bands during that period... and I liked them all, but Alice Cooper was fierce.  That's why I couldn't watch when he was horribly hooked on cocaine.  I had no idea Alice did drugs until this documentary and seeing him on the Tom Snyder show like that was sad, disturbing and upsetting.  I turned my head.

I really enjoyed watching Michael, Neal, Glen, Alice and Dennis interact on stage and the relationship Dennis and Vince had as kids.  It looked like a great ride, then stardom showed-up.  During the Welcome to My Nightmare period, I remember thinking that the show was excellent but the album/music not on par with Alice Cooper, not realizing, as this docu points out, Alice was transforming and descending into a real nightmare.

I'd love to know what the other members of the original Cooper group think about this.  Only one had any input at all.

6388960,5,B00JPXAO36,"I really enjoyed this documentary and have been a fan for many (40+) years hence the five stars. Like some of the other folks here I was gravely disappointed that Michael Bruce was not interviewed and Glen Buxton's early contributions were given short shrift. I watched the ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" induction ceremony and hoped all fences were mended but that was not on display here.  It would have served the band's legacy and Alice's credibility much better had they taken the same approach 'Rush' documentary filmmakers (Beyond the Lighted Stage) gave their original drummer John Rutsey and talked in respectful terms about Michael and Glen's contributions. Instead, they glossed over them both as if they were not important to the band's history. I call foul. This is akin to telling the Rolling Stones' story without mention of Keith Richards or Brian Jones.
You would hope (and pray) that any organization run by a ""Born Again Christian"" and a ""Super Mensch"" would be able to forgive any bad blood from the past, such was not the case, again I call foul. For the record I bought ""Golf Monster"" and loved it, then went on to purchase the audio version when I realized Alice read it, I do not remember the ""baseball size pile of coke"" part of the biography, again a foul.

6388969,3,B00JPXAO36,"Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed everything from Banger films, up to this point.

I did enjoy the archival footage and photos here, but didn't really see anything that wasn't on the Alice Cooper ""Old School"" DVD that accompanied the deluxe box set.

They chose to approach this documentary differently than previous efforts, opting to only use archival film footage and photos with voice over narration.
They used some clever 3D manipulation with still photos to make this less tedious than it might sound and in that they were successful.

Unfortunately, the film makers failed at just about everything else.

They perpetuated band myths that the film makers, the band and a large amount of the audience know to be false.
It is fun to tell everyone what all the myths were, but don't present them as fact.
It is insulting to the longtime fans who really care about the artists.

I realize this is meant to be an entertaining ""documentary"", but I believe the film makers still have an obligation to tell a truthful, balanced version of events.
The omission of anything Michael Bruce is unforgivable for anyone considering themselves a ""Documentary"" film maker attempting to tell a story about the Alice Cooper band.

Would like to have heard more from Dick Wagner but enjoyed deleted scene where he talks a little about the early 80s albums. Not sure why Michael Bruce nor Steve Hunter aren't featured or mentioned in film which is unfortunate.

Talented guy who influenced many in the music industry. Alice may still have the name but he came back to being Vince which saved his life. A success story and now he has the bucks to have fun, real fun without drugs destroying him and support his family comfortably. Also I wanted the best concert Alice did to my liking as a companion to this Documentary. I sampled several concerts on you tube and found it. Brutally live concert done in London 2000.
Actually I found the set list for the show which was typical but the My Generation tribute song for The Who cover I checked out on you-tube Alice with the band absolutely rocked the house. Not did they do My Generation but also did Revolution by the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix's Foxy Lady and The Doors. Isn't it great when I saw and heard this one track it made it worth it to get. The rest of the concert is just icing on the cake. If anyone wants to have a copy of the best Cooper live concert get this one. Filmed with 2 angle cameras in of course 5.1 surround sound. Awesome!

6388975,4,B00JPXAO36,"Overall a great film, I really love the way the directors made it seem like the story was being told in real time, and the use of archival footage, stock footage and classic AC music was fantastic. As a long time Coophead I was surprised to learn some things I'd not known before, but was disappointed by the fact that Michael Bruce was completely written out of the story. Perhaps MB refused to participate, but it's hard to tell the story of the Alice Cooper Group without any mention of the co-writer of most of the hits. It was like airbrushing Art Garfunkel out of a documentary about Paul Simon. Despite this criticism, I thoroughly enjoyed this doc and will be passing it around to my friends.",1402444800,41,700,4.519685039370079

8653167,4,B00JPXAO36,"Very awesome documentary on the master of shock rock himself, that is Alice Cooper. When i played this movie and watched it, i'm surprised that it doesn't seem to have the interviews of the actual people in this documentary like they do in all the other documentaries. Every comment the artist and friends made in this movie were all recorded and played in the movie. Kinda like what they did on The Rolling Stones Crossfire Hurricane documentary. Overall, a pretty awesome documentary.",1516838400,,486,4.939024390243903
8653168,4,B00JPXAO36,"After seeing such Banger Films productions as Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, Iron Maiden Flight 666, Metal Evolution, and Rush Beyond the Lighted Stage, I was excited to hear they were doing an documentary on the great Alice Cooper.

However, I feel this documentary falls a little short.  It goes through Alice Cooper's history pretty quickly from the earliest incarnations to his 1986 comeback, but there really isn't much that wasn't covered on his Behind the Music special in the late 1990s.

I think Alice would've been better served with a complete career overview such as his comeback hit ""Poison,"" the Alice Cooper Group's Induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the reunion of the original group (minus the deceased Glen Buxton) on the Welcome 2 My Nightmare album in 2011.",1516579200,,793,4.947368421052632

8653173,3,B00JPXAO36,I love this DVD yet at its conclusion I didn't feel that satisfied that they nailed Alice's incredible career...so my suggestion is that this is viewed as a supplement to the 2DVD set Prime Cuts which is awesome.  SDAC blew by pivotal moments in his career such as Billion Dollar Babies and didn't really mention how important Dick Wagner was when Alice went solo... Prime Cuts goes deeper....,1489276800,,393,4.779411764705882
8653174,4,B00JPXAO36,"How many songs charted for Alice Cooper after the original band was jettisoned? Who cares as long as manager Shrp Gordon ended up cooking breakfast for the Dalai Lama! That's the pathetic takeaway from this highly creative and well-made movie. Alice Cooper the band -- with Shep and Bob Ezrin on board -- changed the art form. Alice Cooper the brand changed how that art form got cashed in. Without guitarist and songwriter Michael Bruce, who goes largely unmentioned here, the core that made this endeavor truly great isn't there. Enjoy your breakfast, Shep!",1478304000,,559,4.957446808510638
