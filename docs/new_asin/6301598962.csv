The movie uses real names of people, families, and towns that were part of this counties heritage. It may not be a very pleasant part, but it makes for a great story. It gets a little crazy at the end, but I still like the movie overall. Ernie Hudson plays a great ""ex-vet"" roll in the movie and Don Swayze (Patrick Swayzes' brother) plays a great ""bad-guy, red-neck"" character.",1372291200,,523,4.292929292929293

7812975,3,6301598962,"Trapper County War was viewed with high expectaions. We considered the idea of Don Swayze being a renagade Confederate trying to pull off a Southern accent and making his world-renowned facial ticks absolutely appealing. Who wouldn't? However, the filmakers seemed to try to make a sentimental love story out of this movie rather than making it good old fashioned B!

80's heartthrob, Rob Estes plays a Jersey stud driving to an undoubtedly sexy location for vacation. Unfortunately, he takes a wrong turn and ends up in the backwoods of North Carolina. Naturally, he can't go 5 minutes without some chick falling for him or his skin-tight acid washed levis.  So the chick happens to be the sister/girlfriend of non other than screen legend Don Swayze. Obviously, in real life Swayze would go John Blackwell, his famous character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>, on him and rip him up. But this was an 80's movie, so Estes wins the girl and gets to leave Trapper County with the help of a crazy Vietnam vet.

Trapper County War was good times, bad times, and the Swayze times.  We would still recommend popping it in, but maybe not first in your summer B line up.

7812976,1,6301598962,"Throughout history, Hollywood has loved to trash folks who live in the Appalachians and the Ozarks as being ""white trash"" and ""hillbillies."" There have been numerous movies such as the Ma & Pa Kettle flicks that were devoted to portraying folks who live in rugged rural areas as being hopelessly backwards and pretty much illiterate. Even now, hill folk are one of the few groups of people that normally politically correct Hollywood feels few compunctions about denigrating. One example of the way that Hollywood treats folks in the rural mountain regions is 1989's Trapper County War .

Trapper County War begins when city guy Ryan Cassidy (Rob Estes) takes a wrong turn while on vacation and winds up in a backwoods North Carolina county run, owned and operated by the evil Luddigger family that is hell bent on lording over everyone else. Naturally, the city slicker does not have the sense to get the hell out of Dodge, err Trapper County, and gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. He makes common cause with one of those Vietnam veteran psychos who populate Hollywood productions (Vietnam veterans are another group that Hollywood loves to trash) against the Luddigger tyranny. He also meets and immediately champions the cause of the abused stepdaughter of the Luddigger family, Lacey (Betsy Russell). What follows is just another cookie cutter formula action thriller that seems to have been originally intended as being a ripoff of the 1st Rambo movie, ""First Blood.""

Trapper County War is basically just another rendition of the Hollywood theme of enlightened city slicker vs. the crazed backwoods creeps. The whole idea that taking a wrong turn on vacation gets someone in this kind of trouble is just ridiculous. The acting talent, such as it was, must have found it especially difficult to keep straight faces while spouting what passes for dialogue in this movie. As for Betsy Russell, she is quite beautiful in this movie, but evinces all the acting talent of a tree stump. Then again, she may have been doing this turkey of a movie strictly for the money.

In any event, Trapper County War is only worth your time if you enjoy ridiculing bad movies.",1157241600,,2171,4.926229508196721
