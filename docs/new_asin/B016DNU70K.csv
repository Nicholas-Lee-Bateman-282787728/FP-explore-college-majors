7470703,4,B016DNU70K,"From the start, this movie is clearly an ultra-low budget flick that doesn't seem overly concerned with acting quality.  In fact, Michael Ironside (Extraterrestrial, Total Recall) gives perhaps his most ridiculously hammed up performance I've ever seen as some sort of evil tyrant in this post-apocalyptic Mad Max wasteland.  Not one second of this film takes itself seriously and thank God for that.  It's part 80s action B-movie and part 80s videogame in theme and score, embracing its lunacy and running with scissors at top speed.

The Kid (Munro Chambers; Godsend) is a quirky young scavenger scouring the wastelands for trinkets to entertain himself and goods to trade for survival resources.  He meets a bright-eyed, awkwardly idiosyncratic and perhaps mentally challenged girl named Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) who takes an instant liking to himwith a dash of stage-5 clinger craziness and equal parts adorable naivet.

This movie taught me a few things.  For example, duct taping a lawn gnome to a baseball bat creates a dangerous weapon called a gnomestick.  I also learned that the best way to settle a post-apocalyptic dispute is by arm-wrestling over hot toasters.  Oh, and be wary of evil robots!

The adventure takes hold when The Kid finds Turbo Rider dead and dons his armor and turbo blaster power glove, which hilariously turns its target into explosions of gooey mess.

Written and directed by newcomers Yoann-Karl Whissell, Anouk Whissell and Franois Simard, this film feels rather innocuous until the gore graces the screen.  Dismemberment accompanied by spewing red corn syrup and abundant gore-slathered chunky gushings beg us for forgiveness for the sinfully non-existent budget.  And you know what?  It works.  I like watching torsos get quartered, blood geyser eruptions and bicycle-drawn disembowelment.

The connections to Fury Road's (2015) water tyrant and Soylent Green (1973) were well-intended, but didn't fit my fancy nearly as much as the 80-90s videogame references to Zelda and the Nintendo PowerGlove.  And despite its utter nonsense--best characterized by liquefying people and low-speed BMX chases--I ""think"" I enjoyed this.  The combat violence was tedious at best (probably meant to be funny--but not so much for me), but I found it salvaged by the ridiculous gore.

I find myself questioning the genre of this movie.  It's ultra-gory nature has made it an instant favorite to horror gorehounds, but it's more of a campy action B-movie.  I guess it doesn't really matter, does it?  It's zany and bloody and funny, and that does it for me.  If you enjoy pure cinematic lunacy, then this is probably for you, too.  I will see that among movies like this, this is more on the forgettable side and I definitely have no desire to ever see it again.  But I might be interested to see what these filmmakers do next, preferably with a bigger budget.",1455494400,2,2881,5.117773019271948

7470705,5,B016DNU70K,"Set in the future of the year 1999, a world ravaged by acid rain and toxic clouds, savage gangs rule the wasteland, one hero on his BMX bike is about to rise up against evil.
This certainly is one of the years most original movies, its mad max on two wheels, set in the post apocalyptic future world of 1999, everybody rides bikes (BMX's especially) this movie is so awesomely retro its unbelievable, if you love the 80's and 90's its a dream, with cool looking retro outfits and gadgets, the gore and effects are all old school too, our adventure starts with The Kid (Munro Chambers) a young lad who is a scavenger surviving in the wasteland, he meets up with a girl named Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) and together they embark on a mission to bring down the evil ruler of the wasteland Zeus (Michael Ironside) the cast is fantastic in this movie, Munro is a great lead and builds up the super hero role well over the course of the movie, Laurence Leboeuf is utterly fantastic as the female lead Apple, an amazing actress who is so much fun to watch! and of course you cant get a more badass retro baddie than Ironside!! The movie never gets boring, its well paced out with great character development and plenty of very bloody gory violence, all the blood and gore effects are great looking practical effects for most part, the locations are cool, the synth soundtrack is very retro cool, its one of the best of 2015 a must see for fans of this genre, Turbo man on a BMX hero of the wasteland, nothing can be more cool. this is a must see!!

7470706,5,B016DNU70K,"My second favorite movie of 2015! If you know then you're in the know, if you don't then you're missing out and need to buy this movie immediately! Screw Avengers, Jurassic world, and even Star wars, this movie deserves your dollar like no other! Excellent flick! Have you seen that short movie Kung Fury? Yeah well this movie is an 80's throwback flick that makes Kung Fury look like the shiny floppy baloney turd that it is! Turbo kid is low budget, it's true. But it's like spending a buck on a burger at McDonald's and the person at the window gives you a gigantic bag full of Burger King sandwiches and pie and winks at you, and then you look over and some bikini-clad babe is sitting next to you and she loves Burger King. Turbo kid is just like that.",1450396800,6,757,4.338028169014085
7470707,5,B016DNU70K,"I've probably seen this film about 10 times now. It's just that good, extremely rewatchable. You like a nice pumping synth soundtrack? Fun rememorable characters? Bloody fun action? This movie's got it all, and once I saw they actually made a steelbook of it (which I love collecting) I got crazy excited and bought it immediately. I'd say if you're a fan of film, maybe craving some 80's action nostalgia, pick up Turbo Kid immediately, definitely worth every cent.",1450137600,7,466,4.9113924050632916

There was a problem with my order and it was cancelled for some weird reason, but when I contacted MFY, they addressed it right away and got the movie to me ASAP. As someone who works customer service, I thought they were awesome. Will definitely be doing more business with them.",1487030400,,361,4.402985074626866

8736355,5,B016DNU70K,"(I have the three-disc ""Ultra Turbo Charged Special Collectors Edition"" collector's release and not this one so I can't comment on the exact product, only the movie.) This movie is not for everyone. As other reviewers have noted, the budget on this film is minimal. The filmmakers did a good job of minimizing the impact, though a few scenes are hurt by it (the android graveyard is depressingly unimpressive). What isn't hurt by the budget is the clear love of 80s cinema the creators have and their desire to share that love. If you liked the cheesy Cannon films of the 80s you'll like this film. If you're OK with a by-the-numbers film with a love of over-the-top gore and aren't looking for anything too deep? There are far worse ways to kill a couple hours. If you remember scouring VHS tapes at the video store, looking for obscure off-beat horror and sci-fi, avoiding mainstream films and connecting with a film maker over a labor of love? This is your movie. Gnomestick not included.",1460073600,,991,4.7011494252873565

8736360,5,B016DNU70K,"Imagine a movie that was everything you loved about the 80s and 90s with synthesizer music,  over the top blood soaked effects,  a future which looks like a wasteland set in 1990, and a super hero kid on a bmx with a weapon that looks like a Nintendo power glove.  Now add in a great story line and very developed characters.  That's turbo kid. This movie surprised me.  I have been following it in the horror magazines I read and it sounded pretty cool but possibly cheesy.  I found out very quickly once watching that it is far from cheesy. I can go so far as to say this is the best movie I've seen this year so far and I am a horror/fantasy /scifi geek. Highly recommended watching. I really loved the turbo glove,  really reminded me of my old Nintendo glove!",1455840000,,764,4.300699300699301
