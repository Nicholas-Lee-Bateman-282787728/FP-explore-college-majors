1818253,5,B00007KK5I,"My second favorite Norman Lear show - am so happy it's finally coming to DVD in the boxed sets it richly deserves!!  ""Good Times"" was a spin-off of sorts of ""Maude,"" using the character of Florida Evans who was Maude's sharp-tongued maid.  Set in the Chicago, the sitcom follows the Evans family, headed by proud James Evans, Sr., and their lives in the projects of Chicago.  Groundbreaking, Emmy-winning, and sometimes controversial, ""Good Times"" was often as funny as it was thought-provoking; I watched it every week growing up, and can't wait for the DVD of this first season, which should include these episodes, as they aired in order:
#1 Getting Up The Rent -- James Evans has been out of work most of the month. He's late on his rent payment and the landlord is ready to forcibly evict his family. James takes his pool stick down to the billiards hall and stakes his last bit of money. He wins and returns just in time to pay up. Florida remains unaware of James' gambling stunt, and thanks the Lord Jesus.
#2 Black Jesus -- J.J. has painted a portrait of a Black Jesus. Suddenly there is a run of good luck in the family. James wins two bets in the same day. But they must choose - does J.J. get to enter the painting in a contest for the art gallery? Or does the painting stay in the living room?
#3 Too Old Blues -- The family plans to celebrate James' new job. But then they find out he didn't get it because he is a couple years too old to meet government requirements.
#4 God's Business is Good Business -- James' old army buddy visits. He is now a wealthy TV minister, and offers James a job. But James turns it down after dishonest tactics are revealed.
#5 Michael Gets Suspended -- Michael gets suspended because he called George Washington a racist for owning slaves.
#6 Sex and the Evans Family -- Florida finds a sexually explicit book in the house. She is surprised when it turns out to be Thelma's. But Thelma's college boyfriend is only using it for a school paper.
#7 Junior Gets a Patron -- J.J. has sold a painting. But the art customer turns out to be one of James' old enemies. James throws the man out and refuses to let J.J. do the work, so J.J. runs away from home to live and work at the man's home. But he is unable to work in this new, peaceful environment. Florida sneaks off to visit J.J., then James turns up too. James and his friend call a truce, and J.J. returns home.
#8 Junior the Senior -- James and Florida are upset when J.J. gets passed to his senior year, even though he got a failing report card. They meet with the principal.
#9 The Visitor -- A letter written by Michael complaining about poor conditions in the housing projects prompts a visit from a high ranking city official. James is furious with his son, The Militant Midget.
#10 Springtime in the Ghetto -- The building superintendent is holding a contest for best kept apartment. Florida is eager to win and cleans up the whole house. But Michael brings Ned the wino home at the last minute. The family cleans Ned up with a bath and new clothes, and they win! It turns out the lady doing the judging is Ned's estranged wife.
#11 The TV Commercial -- Florida is chosen to appear in a tv commercial for a health tonic. But she turns down the high paying role after learning the tonic is 35 percent alcohol.
#12 The Checkup -- James is angry, smashing furniture and yelling. Michael and Thelma think he is suffering from hypertension and talk him into taking a physical exam. The Doctor tells James he has a high cholesterol level, and instructs him to cut back on salt and fat.
#13 My Son the Lover -- J.J. is dating a wonderful new girl. He is also painting her portrait for free. His heart is broken when the girl breaks up with him the same day he completes her painting.

Can't wait for Season Two, these first half-seasons of 13 episdodes aren't enough, but am glad to have them for now!!",1041120000,64,3899,4.403606102635229

""Good Times"" chronicles the Evans family's plight of living in the inner city - taking on serious issues such as unemployment, crime & hardship. In spite of these obstacles, this family has quite a strong bond for one another. It is that bond that keeps this family ""scratchin' & survivin'"", proving with a lot of patience & love, any storm can be weathered. ""Good Times - The Complete First Season"" contains many great moments, such as James, Sr. (played by John Amos), going for a job apprentice training program in the episode ""Too Old Blues"", only to discover James is turned down because of his age. Religion is an important staple in the Evans household in ""Black Jesus"", while keeping on the religious front, an old army buddy of James stops by & offers him a position in his caravan in ""God's Business Is Good Business"". Florida (played by Esther Rolle) is offered the opportunity of starring in a television commercial to promote a health tonic in the episode ""The TV Commercial"", & an old friend of James sees potential in J.J. (Jimmie Walker) & his paintings in ""Junior Gets A Patron"". When the rent is due & the family finds themselves short of cash, James hustles a game of pool in ""Getting Up The Rent"". As you can see, there's plenty of episodes to satisfy fans & individuals of all ages. There's a reason why ""Good Times"" lasted for a run of six seasons: top-notch writing & storylines, excellent production values & seasoned acting are all qualities that made ""GT"" a sitcom worthy of many a view.

I was only 8 when the series first aired, but recalled it as being really funny. Even though it's 30+ years old, the humor is just as fresh and the topics just as relevant. Some of the episode issues sparked very interesting conversations about how we should/would handle the same situation.

1818357,5,B00007KK5I,"Let's face it, Good Times was never the same after James Evans Sr. played by John Amos was killed off. Esther Rolle fought hard to keep the Evans family as the first African American nuclear family on television with a father and a mother. James and Florida Evans were terrific together as a couple onscreen and believable playing parents to J.J., Thelma, and Michael. I loved the bickering between J.J. and Thelma because there was still love between them. Michael was the radical son who aspired for greatness. THen there is the lovely and funny Willona Woods, beloved friend and neighbor, to the Evans family with all the gossip. The thirteen episodes began a legacy of a long series run. The first season has the family living in urban Chicago. No mention of Maude where Florida Evans first appeared or of life in New York City.

There is some debate on whether Good Times was in fact a spinoff from Maude. A forum member on Sitcoms Online Message Boards believes this show not to be a spinoff at all. On account of the few inconsistencies between the""Florida Evans""of Maude and the one of Good Times.

1. When he appeared on Maude,Florida's husband,s(though played by the same actor John Amos)first name was Henry,not James.

2. When she was still Maude's maid,Florida and""Henry""claimed to live in New York,not eastside Chicago.

1818365,5,B00007KK5I,"Nominated for three Golden Globes, Good Times premiered in mid-season 1974 to widespread critical acclaim and audience popularity. A spin-off of the Bea Arthur (of Golden Girls fame) sitcom Maude (1972), Good Times became the fourth of five highly successful sitcoms brought into being during the 1970's decade by Norman Lear. In addition to Maude, those sitcoms were All In The Family (1971), Sanford & Son (1972), and The Jeffersons (1975). The second of three to focus exclusively on African-American family life, Good Times became a source for groundbreaking social commentary in compliment to its penchant for hilarious family comedy...

Good Times centers around the lives of James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), an African-American couple raising their three children in a Chicago housing development. Eldest son J.J. (Jimmie Walker) is a skinny, wisecracking ladies man with an affinity for painting. Middle child Thelma (BernNadette Stanis) plays the role of moderating influence on the passions of her two brothers, while youngest son Michael (Ralph Carter) is always involved in a cause to help others or end an injustice. The family is often visited by Florida's best friend from high school, Willona (Ja'net DuBois), who also lives in the project. In later seasons, she's accompanied by adopted daughter Penny (Janet Jackson). With additional comic relief provided by overweight super Nathan Bookman (Johnny Brown), Good Times is a family-oriented TV series laden with great one-liners and plenty of laugh-tracks...

The Good Times (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Too Old Blues"" in which James is exciting at the prospect of being hired for a high-paying job. But while at the interview, James learns that the training program for the job only accepts qualified applicants aged 18-35. At 42, he's too old for the job. Meanwhile, Florida and the kids have put together a surprise party unaware that James was rejected... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Getting Up the Rent"" in which the Evans family is faced with an eviction notice, prompting each member to devise a scheme for coming up with the necessary cash, and ""The Visitor"" in which Michael's letter-to-the-editor about the housing conditions at the Evans' project merits a visit from a housing commission official who experiences the squalor firsthand...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Good Times (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 1 (Too Old Blues)

Episode 2 (Black Jesus)

Episode 3 (Getting Up the Rent)

Episode 4 (God's Business is Good Business)

Episode 5 (Michael Gets Suspended)

Episode 6 (Sex and the Evans Family)

1818367,5,B00007KK5I,"Okay before I start I try ANYONE to turn on their televisions today,or even in the 80's and 90's and find anything REMOTELY CLOSE to 'Good Times' on a network channel! Sure the shows 'breakout' star was Jimmie 'DY-NO-MITE' Walker but I LOVE Esther Rolle as Florida Evans,the great mother of this Chicago family who tries to keep a cool head that her often frusterated husband James (John Amos) didn't have. Plus there were three kids-the wisecracking JJ (Walker),his sister Thelma and the (then) extremely militant little brother Michael. One of my favorite shows on this DVD is 'The Visitor' where the Evan's receive a little visit from the housing commishioner William Stonehurst (a much more interesting character then the latter insipid janitor Bookman)when Michael confronts the man by saying that 'boy is a white,racist word'.Of course I've noticed that remarks like this make some believe that this show indulges in alot of reverse racism but I disagree-it's only part of mid 70's inner city culture. Also not to be missed here is 'Black Jesus' in whitch buddiing artist JJ paints a black jesus,actually it's only the local rummy Ned the Wino (HAHAHAHAHA)-wish I'd thought of that lol. One little problem-this show and others like it only tend to underscore the fact the sitcoms and television in general has taken a major nose dive these days with most 'black centered' shows dealing with general clowning and have been de-politisized to the nth degree!

It is also nice to have all of the episodes on demand with no commercials, which almost allow you to watch the whole season in one sitting.

The down side of this DVD is the lack of background information, and the fact that you will have to flip the DVD over after the first few episodes.

But in either case, these episodes recall Bobby Kennedy's 1967 statement that he would like for all networks to show a no-punch -pulled documentary of ghetto life to wake White America up out of it's apathy. ""Good Times"" was probably the closest thing to what he may have had in mind, although it's actual effect was limited. These early episodes, prior to the emergence of JJ's clowing, did more to tell the truth about ghetto life than any other of it's time, and even now for that matter.

1818377,5,B00007KK5I,"You can have your Huxtables, but for my time and money, I'll gladly settle for the Evans family of the 1970s sitcom ""Good Times."" Here was a TV show that never pandered to PC norms, nor did it preoccupy itself with projecting this clean image of the ""perfect"" family as ""The Cosby Show"" did. It was an honest portrayal of an African American family living in the projects of Chicago. Shortsighted critics who nitpicked at ""Good Times"" for its alleged ghetto stereotypes ignored the big picture and bypassed its messages of tough love, Black pride, and family unity. While the Evans family did bicker and fight over even the most frivolous of matters, they clearly loved each other and pulled together in moments of crisis. There's Esther Rolle (who left the series after a dispute but later returned) who played the God-fearing, let's-do-the-right-thing matriarch Florida; there's James (John Amos) who was the hotheaded yet hardworking father who struggled to provide for his family; J.J. (Jimmie Walker), the clownish yet talented painter who never runs out of insults to trade with his sister Thelma (Bernnadette Stanis). Michael, the youngest, was ""the Militant Midget,"" a studious and highly intelligent young kid. I almost forgot Wilona, the gossipy neighbor played by Janet DuBois who always looked stylish, even by modern standards. Columbia has released the first season of its 13 episodes on 2 DVDs; my favorites are ""Michael Gets Suspended,"" ""The Checkup,"" and ""My Son the Lover."" Truthfully, I love them ALL, and once you see one episode, you'll want to watch the next one and the one after that and so forth. These DVDs have virtually no features including a commentary, documentary, or other extras you'd expect from a Columbia release. Also, don't be fooled by the term ""Dolby Surround"" on the package. It sounds more like a mono mix to me, which is fine, as it gives the presentation that ""vintage"" feel. Still, if you always loved the sitcom, you have to get this DVD. I just hope that Columbia will release ALL seasons (including the ones that have Janet Jackson as Wilona's adopted daughter Penny) of this fine series, which proves that the 1970s were among the best decades for American TV.",1055635200,9,2210,4.943548387096774

1818379,5,B00007KK5I,"I absolutely love ""Good Times - The Complete First Season""! I have watched this show on television for years and have always loved it. The show was cancelled when I was an infant, but I was fortunate to watch it in re-runs while growing up. It was interesting to see how a working class black family living in the projects could rise about all of their struggles and manage to be a loving family. The lessons taught in just about each episode are not blatant, but you definitely get the point, whether it's from Esther Rolle's loving character, Florida Evans, or the stern father James Evans, played perfectly by John Amos.
I love this DVD set because I can not only watch all 12 episode from the first season, but I can also pick and choose which episodes I want to watch.

1818380,5,B00007KK5I,"When I was a kid, Good Times was one of those TV shows I simply would not miss each week. Even after its hilarious run ended, it was a constant companion of my youth in the form of syndicated reruns. Eventually, it faded away from the airwaves, and that is why I am so happy to see the release of this complete Season One DVD collection. The trials and joys of the Evans family have always been an indelible part of my memory, but watching these early episodes again is in many ways like seeing the show for the very first time. I used to just laugh at the crazy antics of J.J. and enjoy the show only for its comedy, but now I can more clearly understand the deeper meaning behind it all. While the Evans family life is far from typical, it does nobly reflect the struggles, pride, and humanity of families trying to survive and make a good life for their children in ghetto conditions. This truly was a groundbreaking television show, the first to feature a realistic African-American family trying to overcome life's great adversities together. However much they bickered and argued, the Evans family members supported and loved one another a great deal, and I believe it is this facet of the show as much as its unsurpassed comedy that explains its appeal to viewers of all races then and now.
Almost thirty years later, Good Times is still funnier than almost every other television show ever produced. What impressed me is the way the show began; the look and feel of the series was already firmly established in the very first episode, as James struggles to pay the rent and keep his family off the streets. When I was little, I didn't particularly like James because he seemed mean to me with his constant yelling. As an adult, I am a tremendous fan of John Amos' portrayal of the proud, hardworking family patriarch. This man worked like a dog in order to provide for his family, and the constant problems he faced getting and then keeping jobs is more than enough reason to explain his sometimes heated words and deeds. I no longer look at Good Times as the J.J. show; this first season seems to me to built around James Evans, Sr., although Esther Rolle, Jimmie Walker, Ralph Carter, Bernnadette Stanis, John Amos, and Ja'net Du Bois all delivered truly wonderful performances. Toward the end of these first 13 episodes, J.J. does begin to emerge as the prominent comedic talent, having served earlier as dependable but not yet featured comic relief. Jimmie Walker really comes into his own on the final episode included here, ""My Son the Lover,"" setting the stage for great and equally hilarious things to come in later seasons.
I won't go into an episode by episode discussion, but I will mention a few of the really significant storylines that appeared. The struggle James has bringing home the bacon is a constant, but the burdens caused by his lack of education deliver a strong message to both J.J. and the viewing audience in ""Junior the Senior."" Teenage sexuality is addressed in ""Sex and the Evans Family,"" a story featuring a classic display of the double standard that exists between males and females. Racism is constantly at the fore, personified in young Michael (or as James often calls him, ""the militant midget""). The importance Florida places on religion and always doing what is right, no matter the costs incurred by your decision, is another strong element of the show, one given a brilliant exposition in the very second episode, ""Black Jesus."" Every episode imparts a meaning to the audience, one never lost amidst all of the comedy - and I do mean comedy. Good Times is still laugh-out-loud funny; it actually seems funnier now than it did years ago. While young viewers may not ""get"" some of the jokes based on 1970s pop culture, there is more than enough comedy spread around to guarantee a fun time will be had by all. There are no frills to this DVD package, though. I would have liked to see at least some sort of special feature, be it interviews with cast members or some kind of feature relating the story of how Good Times made it on to CBS as a somewhat controversial spin-off of a spin-off (All in the Family begat Maude, and Maude begat Good Times). You do get a little promo advertising the other vintage television shows already released by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, but this can hardly be called a special feature. In the end, though, what matters most is the newfound opportunity to enjoy the episodes themselves once again. I hope more seasons of Good Times are forthcoming because the thirteen shows from Season One, as great as each and every one of them are, are simply not enough to satisfy my demands for more.",1049500800,37,4678,4.657799274486094

1818383,5,B00007KK5I,"Next to Sanford and Son,Good Times was the greatest African American sitcom of all time. But unlike S&S,Good Times dealt with issues such as poverty and race,all told from the prespective of a close knit black family living in the Chicago projects.
  The family included Florida Evans(Esther Rolle who was carried over from Maude),her husband James(John Amos)their children James Jr a/k/a J.J.(Jimmie Walker),Thelma (played by the still fine Bern'Nadette Stanis) and Michael(Ralph Carter).Ja'net Du'Bois also played neighbor Willona Woods(along with the aforementioned Stanis,one of the sexiest ""sistas"" on TV in the 70's).
 Every episode from the first season is a classic. The ones that stand out are Getting Up The Rent,Black Jesus,Michael Get's Suspended,Sex and The Evans Family,Springtime in the Ghetto(Ned the Wino's classic apperence)and The Check-Up(the infamous ""flying chair"" episode).And who could forget the very involved studio audience(Whooo).
 GT had a great three year streak,but it Jumped The Shark with the death of James Sr(who was the show's soul).Season four tried in vein to carry on without him,even tried to replace him with Carl Dixon(Moses Gunn).It got worse when Florida married Carl(so soon after James Sr died!!!!),and moved away with him(Rolle actually quit the show due to salary disputes and J.J.'s buffoonary on the show).The fifth season saw the Evans children trying to make it on their own(very unrealistic)and Willona adopting new character Penny(Janet Jackson),an abused child who showed no psychological scars afterwards. The sixth season saw Thelma marry a football player who was accidentally injured by J.J.(in the worst choreographed fall in TV history)and couldn't play anymore,as well as Esther Rolle's return. By that time,the show was a mockery of it's once great beginnings,and was cancelled not before everyone finally made it out the projects for good(a tad too convienient,yet it made you happy for them).
 Even with it's erratic history,Good Times was in the end about a loving family that faces many problems together and left the audience feeling good.",1045872000,8,2107,5.510835913312693

The other members of the Evans family are the father, James (John Amos), daughter Thelma (BernNadette Stanis), and sons Michael (Ralph Carter) and J.J. (Jimmie Walker). And don't forget Wilonna (Ja'net DuBois) from next door! Sorry, but Penny (Janet Jackson) and Superintendant Bookman (Johnny Brown) don't appear until Season 5 so you'll have to wait for that. The Norman Lear/Bud Yorkin sitcoms were one of a kind and each ground breaking in its own way. They dared to show real life, situations, attitudes, and characters who actually exist. Good Times was unique. It was like the Jeffersons in that it centered around a black family, but the Evans' were different from the Jeffersons both in family size and economic status (The Evans' poor, the Jeffersons rich). Good Times, like the other Lear/Yorkin classics, don't shy away from realistic views and language, but thats why these shows are so important. This type of sitcom won't come along again so get it while you can. Its a great thing that these shows have been preserved and brought to digital in an uncut & unedited form. This 2 DVD set contains the first season of 13 episodes which ran from February to May 1974. There are no extra features other than subtitles, episode selection, and previews, but having such a classic, funny, and important piece of television history in this format at the push of a button is priceless. Actually this release does have the ""play all episodes"" feature, which hasn't been on the other Lear/Yorkin show DVDs, so that's cool.  The next logical release will be Maude, then maybe One Day at a Time! Looking forward to it and all upcoming seasons of All in the Family, The Jeffersons, & Sanford and Son! Here's the episodes for Season One of Good Times:
01. Getting up the rent
02. Black Jesus
03. Too Old Blues
04. God's business is good business
05. Michael gets suspended
06. Sex and the Evans family
07. Junior gets a patron
08. Junior the senior
09. The Visitor
10. Springtime in the Ghetto
11. The TV Commercial
12. The Check Up
13. My Son the Lover
*Trivia: Good Times was co-created by Mike Evans, who played the original Lionel Jefferson on both the Jeffersons and All in the Family. Wonder where he got the idea to call them the Evans'? Also Ja'net DuBois (Willona from Good Times) both co wrote and sings the famous theme song to the Jeffersons!

1818385,5,B00007KK5I,"Good Times was always one of my families favorite sitcoms. It brings back memories of growing up in Brooklyn, New York. Thats was some of the hardest and best times of our lives. The subject matters are still so topical in todays times. It was the sitcom that showed a strong male role model that loved and took care of his family. I can not wait for the Second Season to come out and will definitely buy it the first day it is available. Thank You for the memories.",1045440000,4,466,4.247191011235955
1818386,5,B00007KK5I,"truly was Moved by the Evans Family.the Story Lines were Real&the Family Coming together was truly strong.the Key to this Show was John Amos who played the Role of the Father James SR.He truly lead the Household. A Strong Black Male Figure in the HouseHold was the Key to this Show's Success to me overall. Jimmy Walker had His Moments as did Michael. Thelma, I still have a Crush on Her. Florida Evans Esther Rolle was a Strong Mother Figure as well. I was So Moved at finally getting the full Season on DVD.this Show dealt with so much.",1045094400,4,538,4.444444444444445
1818387,5,B00007KK5I,"Good Times is one of the greatest if not the greatest sitcom of all times. Growing up as a young black child in those days was very dear to me to see a black family with real economic issues able to remain strong and still have pride in being poor, and having a sense of humor about it all. We will always remember that catch phrases DYNOMITE, and the back and forth arguing among siblings that JJ and Thelma use to have. But what really made me proud was you had a black family with a mother and a father in the household raising there kids up until James died. James only having a six grade education was what a real man is all about, willing to except penny annie jobs to put food on the table and support his family, now that is classic. Can't wait til season 2 arrive look forward to adding it to my collection. Thank you Good Times for all the joy and laughter you have brought into our homes.",1044403200,6,899,4.142857142857143
