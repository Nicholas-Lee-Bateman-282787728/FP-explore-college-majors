Both Amazing Riding & Photography!! I dropped it by One-Star due to (about 70% of that) Awful (so-called) 'music' Yuk!!
I wish Free-Style motocross DVD makers would accept that Not everyone wants to hear that Crap. (there should be an alternative audio
track - of just the sights and sounds as they happened. I almost shut the sound OFF - but Silence is an odd way to watch a DVD)
Spectacular Riding!! Pretty much a 'Must' for your collection. Best wishes, Scott M.",1486684800,,528,4.453608247422681

This video highlights some legendary riders, pioneers really and new-comers to the sport of FMX giving it a breathe of fresh air while traveling  to Europe and showcasing FMX practioners of that arena. This video doesn't stick with what can be repetious tricks but illustrates the passion of free-riding and the talent continuing to progress the sport. Anything Jay Schweitzer presents is a masterpiece and this video is no exception. Features legendary riders Mike Metzger, Jeremy Stenberg, Brian Deegan, Todd Potter, Dan Pastor and Robbie Madison just to name a few, you won't be disappointed!",1373068800,,642,5.294117647058823
