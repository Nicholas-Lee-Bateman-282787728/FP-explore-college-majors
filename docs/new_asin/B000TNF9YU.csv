8210209,2,B000TNF9YU,"This four movie pack comes as two DVD's with two movies each, with an external cardboard slipcover.

The two best movies, ""And God Said To Cain"" and ""Blood City"", are on one of the discs.  I would love to find better quality copies copies of them.  This DVD is unwatchable on a wide-screen hi-def TV.  You have to use an old standard-def set, else you'll want to be like (insert celebrity here) and shoot your TV.

The other two movies not only have horrible picture quality, but they're horrible movies themselves.  Since you can get the disc with ""And God Said To Cain"" and ""Blood City"" only right here on Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TM8VOQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1, if you're going to buy, check prices and buy whichever is cheaper.

""Blood City"" is an oddity, a cross between a western and science fiction.  A group of people find themselves in a sort-of Wild West town where the only way to gain status is to kill others.  The people are actually asleep in a modern-day laboratory, with their situation being sent to their heads through technology (the opening scenes of the movie are of cars on the street, telling you right away this isn't your usual western).  Jack Palance does a fine job of playing the top-dog of the town.  If you've ever seen ""The Prisoner"" episode ""A, B, and C"", it's sort of like that, and comes complete with a surprise ending.

""And God Said To Cain"" follows the 'framed, unjustly accused, unjustly sentenced, just released, and madder than hell' revenge formula.  Klaus Kinksi gets his revenge while a storm howls outside.  If you like revenge films, I think you'll like this one.",1362441600,2,1636,4.838129496402877
8210210,3,B000TNF9YU,"As a spaghetti western fan, I bought this box set for $5 because it had ""And God Said to Cain"" on it, which is modestly famous among genre fans due to being directed by Antonio Margheriti (AKA Anthony Dawson) and starring Klaus Kinski. It is a very simple story of Klaus getting out of prison after ten years for a crime he didn't commit, going to a nearby town, and killing the rich man who framed him and his henchman. The end. Still, it's handled well and is not at all a bad movie. Spaghetti western fans who are interested in this picture would probably be better serviced by a more expensive copy. This is a washed out, pan-and-scan version that really doesn't do the movie justice.

This box set also contains The Ruthless Four, which spaghetti western fans will be interested in for the appearances of Gilbert Roland, George Hilton, and Klaus Kinski. This is the well made tale of a crusty prospector who teams up with the wrong people. Greed gets in the way and no one trusts anyone anymore. Excellent. However, again, the picture was kind of blurry, even for public domain stuff, but this is about the only copy in print as of this writing, so if you want to see this picture, this is your chance.

The third picture is Blood City, which has Jack Palance in a supporting role. The film concerns two tenderfeet who stumble on a wild west community in the present day and are made slaves. It was made in the late 70s and has a low-budget stupid TV movie feel about it. Bad, left me fidgety waiting for it to end. The picture is subpar as well.

The final movie is Border Shootout. I was hopeful that the picture quality would be good because it was made in 1990, but it was still poor. In fact, a landscape shot of the Arizona desert 10 minutes in is just a blur of burnt orange. The movie starts off weak, having obviously been shot on video and having a cheap synth soundtrack, but when the story gets moving, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers tried to make a decent movie despite their budget limitations. It is a familiar tale of evil rancher vs. young deputy, but there is a realistic sense of local politics, and some awareness of geography of the US. Glenn Ford gives an air of class to the whole affair in a bit part.

I'm kind of on the fence with this one, because the publisher, Direct Source, used shamelessly bad prints of these movies. On the other hand, three out of four of them were pretty good. Proceed with caution.",1192838400,5,2448,4.40929203539823
8210211,3,B000TNF9YU,"There are many western multi-packs on the market, some with as many as 100 films in them. None of the sets I've examined and/or reviewed contain any of these movies. That alone makes this a desirable collection. There's a couple of fine old Italian-made films here, which is a big plus as well.

SYNOPSES:

""And God Said To Cain"" - Euro-western directed by horror specialist Antonio Margheriti. Cast includes Gina Lollobrigida's cousin. Familiar but still exciting story of a wrongly convicted man released from prison after ten years who then seeks revenge on the guilty.

""Blood City"" - A reworking of the ""Westworld"" theme. Several amnesiacs awaken in an Old West town and are forced into slavery. They must engage in and win showdowns in order to eventually face off against the town sheriff.

""Border Shootout"" - A young rancher who is appointed deputy in a small town is tyrannized by the son of one of the town's founders.

""The Ruthless Four"" - A long-time prospector strikes it rich, then gets double-crossed by his partner. He engages the help of an old friend and two others to retrieve the rest of his gold. They endure many travails on their journey. A variation of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre.""
