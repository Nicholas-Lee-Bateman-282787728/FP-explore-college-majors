8513784,5,B007BHA0AK,"Oh My! Listening and watching this Campfire DVD is so relaxing.  My blood pressure must have dropped 20 points!  The night sounds of crickets, frogs, night birds blending into the snapping and crackling of the fire make it for a relaxing experience.  The picture and audio are excellent.  It's like you are outside watching the fire and listening to the night sounds -- I swear I could feel the ""heat"" off the fire!",1384300800,2,415,4.6438356164383565
