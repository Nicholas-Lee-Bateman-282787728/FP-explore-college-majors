3902613,5,630457925X,"Overall this DVD is great. My only gripe is that the main concert was shot in a dark club or some sort which made it very bad in lighting, other than that is still a good concert. The extra concert in the special features is much better as far as in picture cause it was shot outside during the day. The interview with the band was great even though I mainly paid attention to Chibi, lol. Hopefully, TBM will release a concert DVD from there ""Pins And Needles"" tours, as that is my favorite album.",1337731200,,497,4.242105263157895
3902614,5,630457925X,"As you know, this CD is a recording of a live concert, and I love it. It's probably one of my favorite albums by The Birthday Massacre, if only to hear different mixes of some of my favorite songs, like Looking Glass and Walking With Strangers. It also introduced me to some songs I hadn't heard before and have since taken a shine to. It's a great CD, and if you like The Birthday Massacre, or even just Goth music in general, you can't go wrong with this one.",1309737600,,461,4.191011235955056
3902615,3,630457925X,"Let's face it: if you're interested in this DVD, you're probably already a fan of TBM.  You and I both love them and their songs.  I'm not here to review the band itself.  They'd get 5 stars all day and night if that were the case.

This DVD though, is not great my any means.  The performance given by the band is quite good, but the quality of the footage is unsatisfactory if I'm being completely honest.  When you buy a DVD of anything, you expect a certain level of video quality.  This disc falls short.  At first I thought it was just because I was viewing it on my 55"" HDTV, but it still looked quite poor when viewed on my modest 24"" computer monitor.  I'm often staring at a blurry, blocky mess of pixels.  I greatly wish this show was shot with better equipment (or converted to DVD properly - I'm not sure what exactly is at fault).

With that said, I'm still ok with having bought it.  TBM fans take whatever they can get of these guys.",1306281600,5,949,4.211111111111111
3902616,5,630457925X,"While no disk can do justice to the energy of a TBM show, this is a solid live DVD.  The 2007 show that matches the Show and Tell CD looks and sounds great.  The bonus material includes a 2005 show, with TBM playing in the rain (unfortunately the production suffers a bit from the bad conditions but it is still good), about a dozen professional stills and an 13 minute interview.  Even if you have only heard a couple tracks by TBM (and you want to know what is the big deal with Chibi) you will be pleased with the high quality of the 2007 show and if you are a fan of the band you will love the bonus material as well.",1293753600,,621,4.032520325203252
3902617,5,630457925X,if you are a fan of this band then this is a no brainer buy it.  i have seen this band live and really there is no way to recreate that amazing experience however this is close.  one of the greatest bands of all time and this should be in every real music fans library.,1284854400,,269,3.8727272727272726
3902618,4,630457925X,"Content: Let me start by saying that I am a very recent fan of TBM, but I love their music. The concert is amazing to watch. Everyone on stage contributes to their great performances. It's just amazing to watch this band be so into their music.

Sound: Great Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, it really is like you are there. Crowd noise during performances is kept a very minimum allowing you to enjoy their live sound.

Image: This DVD looks only acceptable on my 100"" screen. Granted it's not a blu-ray, but this DVD exhibits lots of banding and macroblocking issues. Reds especially seem to be extra blocky throught their performances.
There is decent detail we can see in Chibi's tattos and hair, but it does leave something to be desired as far as the quality goes.

If you are a fan, this DVD is a must OWN!",1270512000,4,805,4.462585034013605
3902619,5,630457925X,"This DVD is a must have for any fan of The Birthday Massacre, regardless of if you've seen them live already or not. The video quality is pretty decent, and their performance is always so beautiful, energetic and artistic. Chibi (the lead singer) is always so adorable with her behavior on stage, this DVD really brings out the personality in every band member. I even found myself clapping along when Chibi would do it as if I were actually participating in the audience. Chibi's was on top of her game the night this was filmed and her voice sounds wonderful.

What they don't tell you for some (stupid) reason is that this video is TWO CONCERTS! haha. They're selling it as one, just the live one in Germany, but in the bonus features section, the entire M'era Luna performance of 2005 is in there! I don't know why its just considered a bonus feature, I think they'd sell more if they actually told people. Maybe its supposed to be a surprise to the fans buying the DVD and i'm currently spoiling their fun (Sorry if I am, TBM). The M'era Luna performance is really cool too because its in the daytime outside, so on an HDTV it looks WAY cooler than the Germany night time main performance this DVD has. There is also a little bonus feature of an interview with TBM on the DVD, and they actually said ""we didn't even know this was going to be a DVD, we were surprised"" which means this concert is raw, real TBM. They didn't go on stage that night with the intent to show off for the DVD, which makes it even more special. It shows that this is how all TBM shows are. High energy, beautifully artistic, and wonderfully executed.

I'd also like to add that the people who filmed and edited the DVD did a great job. It's not just a still shot of their concert. Sometimes the camera will kind of go into ""slow motion"" and turn certain ways with different camera effects, it makes it really fun to watch. It gives the concert even more depth and makes it very unique. Some shots you'll feel like you're literally on stage with them probably tripping over all their cords (hoping you won't break anything since they have so much electronic equipment and stuff on their stage haha), then all of a sudden you'll be in the back of the audience seeing a view of all of the action.

Seriously, even if you don't have any idea who The Birthday Massacre are, just still buy it. Take yourself on a wonderful audio/video journey just because its an experience you'll never forget.",1267228800,13,2469,4.457964601769912
3902620,5,630457925X,My kids thoroughly enjoy this video. They love watching how the milk is produced - from cow to container. They especially enjoy watching how the cookies are mass produced and put into the packages.  i even learned from  it. Must see!,945820800,,233,4.658536585365853
8362750,5,630457925X,"I have been a long time fan of TBM, and have also had the pleasure of working with them in the past and I must say that this performace really captures their endless talents and amazing presence! I have seen a few reviews poking at the quality of the picture as those morons were expecting some big budget hollywood HD quality concert. The picture quality is just fine, it's the audio quality one should concern themselves with, which in this case was perfect! Board quality sound and mixed in 5.1 D.D. This is a must have for any TBM fans and the extras are awesome as well, especially the interviews! I would also choose 'Bear!'
Love TBM, and will support them all the way!",1506038400,,675,4.451612903225806

8362759,5,630457925X,"This is an awesome, but simple look at the fairytale goth band out of Canada. Awesome because they perform the great selection of songs with so much character. It's not a lightshow with fire, smoke, and explosions, but the band surely doesn't need the gimicks. By fairytale, I mean they are light and sweet like Sleeping Beauty, and they are dark like the wicked witch. They pull it off like no other band I know of. If you haven't heard them, see them! You'll never turn back!",1341360000,,477,4.494252873563219
