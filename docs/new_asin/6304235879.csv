7865391,3,6304235879,"I bought this to add to other workouts I do. I actually prefer my step aerobics and turbo jam (both are more intense and better at getting me to sweat), but this is OK to do occasionally for variety",1278028800,,198,4.102564102564102
7865392,4,6304235879,"I have had the tape for a couple of weeks now and have done it every single day. (Okay, except for the first, warm-up section, which includes just way too many dance moves for me; actually, that's the reason I gave the video only four stars.) I'm not an advanced level athlete, but I'm in a fairly good shape and still, working thru this routine will 1. make me sweat, 2. increase my heart-rate and 3. make me feel like those muscles in my leg and buttom ARE working. Also, since the excercises are well varied, it's not easy to get bored of them, not to mention that one can make small changes in almost every excercise to make them more challenging. I also use ankle weights in the last two sections.

I also like the fact that the majority of the girls in the background are in good shape, but not some of those Miss Fitness winners that will just keep making you feel frustrated every time you look at them knowing you'll never quite look the same (even though you know you are not a pro athlete and they are). I absolutely adore the instructor as well - she is inspiring enough without becoming overwhelming.

So, if you want a really good and fun wok-out for your lower body, I will definitely encourage you to get this tape - it's a very good price, too. :o)",1096502400,,1265,4.310924369747899
7865393,4,6304235879,"This video will definitely help tone up your legs, but since it's only a 30 minute video you can't expect to see results anytime soon. It's a good starting point for beginners and a good way to learn what type of moves will tone your legs. I've had this video for about 3 years, and don't use it often, but when I do I'm always surprised by the level of exertion you can get from only 30 minutes of toning. I'd recommend this video as a stepping stone for someone just beginning to get in shape, and as a change in routine for advanced exercisers.",1035936000,,547,4.219047619047619
7865394,4,6304235879,"This is a very great tape for legs, although I hv not achieved the results I wanted yet, I feel that I hv worked out every part of my muscles every time. The tape is fast paced (35mins but there isn't too much talking beforehand or afterwards), it's fun and the instructor is really encouraging and keeps you movitated throughout the workout. She knows exactly when to drops the right comments at the right time, especially when you are about to slack off, she will say ""You can do it"" or ""Think of the legs you've always wanted"", then I will really stick with it for another 5 minutes as I feel as though I am gonna get those sexy legs soon.
The only thing I dislike(but still ok i guess)is the cool down part, when you think ""wow, i am finally done"" u still hv some more to do other than just stretching out at the end. But overall, this tape really worths the money!",1034121600,,869,4.240963855421687
7865395,3,6304235879,"Video is separated into a warm-up, 4 ""leg"" sections and a cool down.  I loved everything except the warm-up and the first leg section.  They were too complicated for me to follow.  Too many ""dance"" type steps and moves all put together.  If you're a clutz like me this video can still serve you well if you fast foreward through the warm-up and first leg section and just do the last 3 sections and the cool down.  It was a good workout, and I suppose if you are coordinated it's even better!",1029974400,,492,4.304347826086956
7865396,4,6304235879,"Ok, so maybe it's not ""killer"" (hence the 4 stars) but it is a good workout. I used this tape as my starter tape to get back into shape and was able to finish the tape, feel the burn, and still want to do it again.",1017878400,,214,3.6739130434782608
7865397,5,6304235879,"The first time I exercised to this video, I was sore for days!  You can really feel your muscles being toned every time.  The segments are challenging, but not so hard that you can't pull through or keep up (like some parts of Buns of Steel Target Toning).  I always look forward to toning with this video and haven't gotten bored with it yet after months of using it.  Since it makes me sweat, I feel like I'm getting aerobic exercise at the same time instead of just toning (like Brand New Butt).",1004140800,2,498,4.32258064516129
7865398,5,6304235879,This video is excellent for beginners and pros.  Moves really shape and tone legs!!!  A definite MUST HAVE!,1000771200,,107,4.888888888888889
7865399,2,6304235879,"I've never enjoyed the first two sections of this video: they use too much living-room space, and demand perfect balance. Only the leg work at the end is good (about 12 minutes).  I love the instructor however, she is a trip  and it's amazing that even on video she could convey so much energy! And  she does have killer legs.",960076800,3,326,4.4
