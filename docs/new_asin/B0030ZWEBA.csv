My husband's a pervert, my mother-in-law's a demon and I just fornicated with a bandit whose face I've never seen!

This big-budget telenovela has action, sword-fighting, deflowering of virgins, evil mothers-in-law whose only desire is to be abuelas, and all my favorite actors. The virgin (Lucero), her deflowerer (Fernando Colunga), her amante (Valentino Lanus) and her poor sexually confused esposo (Arturo Peniche), all contribute to the action of this irresistible telenovela that had me laughing out loud before the opening credits concluded.

We are in Colonial New Spain at the time of the Inquisition; events are unfolding in Columbia, Panama, and Mexico, which reflect the political changes and pressures of the day. It's a time when cancer is called cancrum and syphilis is a death sentence compounded by insanity.

This one features the cutest and most responsive little toddler in the history of telenovelas. He spent seven months on the set and grew a lot there. It is clear that he and the actors all love each other, he reaches out to them with a twinkling smile when they put out their arms.

Along with many false accusations (and some true ones), whippings, hangings, garrotings, poisonings, and many rounds of Who's Your Daddy? we follow the predictable path to reconciliation.

By the way, before I forget, please see Side 2 of Disc 4 for a generous, wonderfully edited batch of hilarious bloopers. (They too, have captions.) Oh! And a happy ending! Yup. I own this one, and I'm glad I do! Thanks Amazon.",1407542400,,1555,5.027237354085603
