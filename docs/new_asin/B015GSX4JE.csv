7435972,5,B015GSX4JE,"A Reunion takes us on a journey across the vast American landscape as two friends struggle to find themselves and reconnect with each other. A thoughtful look at the importance of being true to oneself and honest with the people we care about. Great acting, great music, beautiful cinematography. It is not a simple, happy love story. It is complex, complicated, frustrating, messy, silly, and heartbreaking as we watch two grown men fumble clumsily through their emotional ineptitude and confusion... making for a realistic look at adult relationships and the struggle for gay men that remain repressed in a heteronormative society.",1447113600,14,633,5.2772277227722775

7435975,1,B015GSX4JE,"I watch too many bad gay themed movies in hopes of finding the occasional ignored, under appreciated, or too quickly forgotten fine ones that have gotten lost among the many being released.  For my pains, if I can be excused for saying so, I have been rewarded with some quite good movies, including the comedies Broadway Damage or Turtle Hill, Brooklyn or the emotionally profound, beautifully realized, and original Green Plaid Shirt, a better film about the devastation of AIDS than Longtime Companion or The Normal Heart, both of which suffered from being overly slick, and a movie that's as good as the exceptional and much better known Parting Glances.

I am speaking here mostly of American films.  Those from Europe, Asia, or Latin America seem to be more consistent, perhaps because it is harder to be picked up by distributors for whom, one hopes, questions of aesthetic quality and technical competence might still be real concerns.

Like all bad art, bad movies are painful experiences.  It gives me no pleasure to say that A Reunion is one of the worst gay themed films I have seen in recent years.  The credits list three writers, including the director.  But all the dialogue sounds improvised, as if spoken without forethought or reason.  The movie's plot is two buddies on a road trip, in this case on their way to a college reunion.  (One presumes it is to the University of Chicago, but neither of the two shows any evidence of his having attended any school whatsoever.)  Of the two, Michael is the one who talks the most during the journey, almost incessantly.  A  lot of what he says is either nonsensical or slightly crazed.  I don't think it is meant to sound like either.  You would not want to sit next to him in a car for more than a few miles, if that long.

He is an enigmatic character.  I don't mean that kindly.  Most people, I'd bet, having met him, would want to put a lot of distance between him and them.  He claims to have been spending time in Japan.  He seems to be engaged to a Japanese woman.  He speaks Japanese.  But what he says about Japan and its people is nuts and more than a bit offensive.  He talks randomly, with no sense of its effect on anyone around him, makes up childish games, lets his equally childish imagination run wild at times, and manages to annoy, even to anger the two couples the pair visit, one of them his brother and his Japanese wife.  (I don't know what this Japanese theme is meant to signify since it is never actually developed or worked out, save for the occasional references that are frequently distasteful stereotypes.)  There is something nearly pathological about Michael's personality.  If it is meant to be, than why is his friend so infatuated?  It makes no sense.

Michael's affect is very odd, a mixture of sleepiness, petulance, boredom, mean spiritedness, and a randomness bordering on the infantile.  He plays with his hair like Veronica Lake or Shirley Knight.  He moves awkwardly, as if walking is something he is just learning how to do or he is afraid of toppling over.  He is filmed at times most unflatteringly, with way too much light on his face that ages him, but that also makes him look very creepy.  This is not the actor's fault, of course.  But it is typical of the film's ineptitude.  The guy really is a creep, sorry to say, as the, I assume, excessive lighting emphasizes.  Why does no one in the movie or involved with its making not seem to recognize that fact?  I reject the notion that this creepiness is the movie's deeper sub-text, as the jargon folk like to say.  That would be too subtle.  The film just doesn't work that way.

Yet he is supposed to be the object of his friend's long and unfulfilled love.  Why?  Everything in what there is of a plot in this movie depends upon that longing and his sadness in its being unfulfilled.  It makes me worry about both of their mental healths.  The disjunction between the love felt, or expressed, and its object is mind boggling.

These are flat, dull, emotionally vacuous, and intellectually drab characters that are mostly infuriating for being so empty headed.  The road trip itself manages to hit many of the clich&eacute; scenic highlights or roadside attractions on the way between L.A. and Chicago, though the itinerary is puzzling.  But nothing is done with any of them.  Each one mostly just fills in the time and allows for some more peculiar, meandering, annoying talk.  There is almost no real reminiscing and there are no signs of their ever having been in school together since, save for one sexual encounter, a trio with a woman they visit, they do not talk much about their shared past.  Why not?  Everything about this movie is random, unfocused, unshaped, inept.  It looks as if it had been made quickly and cheaply with nearly no forethought or planning.

I watched it to the end and immediately placed it on my pile of failures.  Of course, there is no filmed reunion.  That is, one never sees a scene which would have been beyond this film's powers.  I would have liked to regard my time spent with it, though only eighty minutes, as not wasted.  Bad art of any kind occasionally leads one to ponder why a work is bad, why one wants to call it such. That stimulus has some value.  But A Reunion is too thoroughly bad, too unknowingly strange and unrealized, to make even that sort of response possible.  It is merely bizarrely bad, it saddens me to say.  Perhaps it has become too easy to make movies these days with no one around to let the director and his actors and crew know when one is obviously no good and needs to be set aside, not seen by others.  This film is the work of amateurs.  Nothing else could explain why it fails so resoundingly.",1446595200,16,5731,4.582677165354331
7435976,2,B015GSX4JE,Sef indulgent waste of time. I couldn't find much to like about either character and only stuck with it because my other half kept wondering where the plot was going.  Reading some of the other reviews I wonder if we watched the same film...,1506729600,,241,4.4772727272727275

7435985,1,B015GSX4JE,"this film might have made a great short (by cutting the current film by about 1/2), but the road movie aspect didn't work for me. rather boring, occasionally plodding. one of the main characters was VERY unlikeable (get a haircut, dude!), and it was a mystery to me why anyone would have been interested in much less attracted to him. although i have nothing against nudity, in this film it seemed gratuitous. in fact, much of what happened struck me as superfluous. a tighter script with better dialogue would have made for a more effective, stimulating film. as it stands, it was a letdown and a waste of my time. sorry, guys, better luck next time!",1478822400,2,651,4.620689655172414

7435987,5,B015GSX4JE,I found it to be a great movie.  It was not in your face gay. It was a reminder of my college days and the guy iI truly loved and will never forget so to me it  was personal.  We both went on to marry and have families.  I am now married to a wonderful guy who is very well love by my children and our grandchildren. I lived the hurt of Josh but that was forty years ago. This film stirred up many old memories of my first gay love but I am truly happy with my life and for the last twenty years have felt the freedom of being out that Josh really wanted.

7436004,4,B015GSX4JE,"I read some of the reviews and had to add my on take on the movie.

 I'm not sure what some of the reviewers saw, but I enjoyed it.  We are on our own to the figure out past details from what we see.  Then it all clicks into place.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride while you realize their past.  It's not raunchy, thank goodness.  Tired of so many movies that throw in an all out sex scenes just to get viewers.

One reviewer said the ""trip"" portion was too detailed. Good grief, enjoy every moment of life.  They did. The detail of the trip WAS the greatest part. And necessary.

We all have to grow up and get own with our lives. Michael did.

Some one said there was no ending.  I disagree. There is an ending.  It's not spoon fed to us, but there is an ending.

 Thank goodness it's not raunchy.  I think it's time that gays are presented as non stereo types.  It's time we stopped living up to what we have been told ALL gays are like. The trip is not wasted film.  It's very important growth and personal examination time.  It's growth. And Again...ITS GROWTH.",1461888000,8,1067,4.167487684729064
7436005,5,B015GSX4JE,"I don't want to say a lot about this movie, other than to give great praise to everyone involved with this project. The action, a story of the unfolding reunion, on a road trip to a college reunion, between two very average old buddies , is just terrific with all the odd side action that takes place on a cross country No big dramas, just the natural re-connection between these two young men.. The acting is wonderful and very real. The atmosphere created by the director is excellent and  I found myself enjoying  my ride-along. Nothing about this movie was normal, in terms of what was to be expected. I am sorry if this doesn't help you, but if you can enjoy a story that unfolds very naturally, with a great deal of warmth and a novel handling of intimacy between two men, I highly recommend you take this road trip. It does feel like the viewer is along for the ride. By the way, the sountrack is well suited to the story and I found it very enjoyable.",1461801600,8,959,4.351955307262569

Although the name of this movie is ""A Reunion"", which they are going to attend, this film is about the here-and-now between Josh and Michael.  Following their trail provided interesting locales.  There are many moments of discovery and understanding, and a few low points, but there was ""little to write home about"" either way.  There is some nudity but not gratuitous.

7436019,4,B015GSX4JE,"O.K., so Josh Watson wrote, produced and starred in this production, which leads me to believe this is a somewhat (if not, entirely) autobiographical story. No problem, because it is done well, in fact, very well. All elements of this film work  beautifully. I am a musician and rarely comment or even notice the music of some films, but I have to say, the music for this film is well-chosen and the perfect soundtrack for what takes place here, namely, buddies on a road trip. The element of cinematography is wonderful. Again, since the story's backdrop and impetus is the road trip, you gotta' have not just good cinematography, but great cinematography and the film delivers on this element as well. The rather phlegmatic pacing of the film is the perfect set-up for the rather jarring and emotionally shocking  denouement. Perhaps, a central question of this film is: What do you do when you know you love someone, and they are not at all sure of who they are and what they want?

It really spoke to my struggle of being an open, honest person, and I'm very satisfied that the film doesn't attempt to placate or excuse the behavior of the manipulative Michael. It's going to be a long road of healing for that guy, but hopefully, he'll eventually find the reunion with himself that he so desperately needs.

It's emotionally honest, heartbreaking, and stands out in the pantheon of gay films. I loved this movie and cannot recommend it enough.",1447113600,11,578,4.6568627450980395
