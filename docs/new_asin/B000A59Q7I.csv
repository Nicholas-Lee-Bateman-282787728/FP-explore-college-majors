8074463,4,B000A59Q7I,"THE TEASER[1973/72 mins]: Becky is a young college student who works at a small shop but also does some topless stage dancing at a seedy club. After one of her dance sessions, Becky is followed by a dirtbag that she just rejected. When her car breaks down, he proceeds to brutally attack her in her own car. After the attack Becky is ""saved' by a rich couple which includes Andrea(Rene Bond) and her sleazy husband. Becky is taken back to the couple's home where Andrea teaches her first-hand about girl-on-girl love-making. But when something goes really wrong for Becky during a big orgy session, a nerdy fellow(whom she initially rejected) comes to the rescue.

FRANKIE & JOHNNIE...WERE LOVERS[1975/73 mins]: Frankie(Rene Bond) is a club singer with a boyfriend who works at a computer lab and is a car junkie. During his working hour, Frankie visits him, strips naked, and they ""do it"" on top of one of them old computers(which spits out some corny lines). Meanwhile Frankie's jealous ex-husband is not too fond of Johnnie and proceeds to attack him. But then Johnnie actually has the hots for Andrea(Frankie's gal friend). It's one big mess with long chase scenes and extended soft-core three-way(and four-way) scenes.
