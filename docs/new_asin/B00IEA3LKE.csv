6260923,3,B00IEA3LKE,not that great,1411776000,3,14,4.0
6260924,3,B00IEA3LKE,"One of my rules for film watching was tested this time around. No matter what the budget is, be it a million dollars or 25 cents I need to be entertained. Well, this movie looks like it cost about 25 cents maximum, and yes I was surprisingly engrossed by the film despite its short 70 minute run time. I only had a screener, so there may be extra features on the regular release.

1 Last Chance at Paradise follows a gay teenage couple (Wade Radford & Connor Paganini) on their reaction and acceptance of the apocalypse. It's never made clear if this is the last night of their lives as well, or if they think they are the last survivors. Knowing one or the other would have helped me to decide if the way they chose to deal with the circumstances would be the same way I would deal with them. Sure, if it's the last night of my life, I want to be with the one I love and spend every waking second either loving them or telling them how much I love them. On the other hand, if this is some sort of apocalypse and there is a chance for survival, I'd want my loved one with me but I'd be trying to find survivors and find a way for us to survive as well. Hints are given throughout the film that the latter scenario is true. Bodies in the street are mentioned at one point, and a comment made at one point about gas masks being available in the house or not. Of course, we need to realize that this is based in reality, and these are teenagers who are sick, hungry, and scared to death. Everyone would react in a different way, and I'm sure that some people would react in this way. Try to stay safe and inside as long as possible.

The other angle that plays along side this drama of the end of humanity is the flashbacks of one of the boys mother trying to come to terms with the fact that her son is gay. I have to admit, much of this was more uncomfortable watching than the impending doom of the main characters. It seems that the mother (Honey Bane) is really trying to understand in her own way, but that way is very selfish, verbally abusive, and unforgiving. She wants her boy to have a nice wife who will take care of him like she has, and for her to have grandchildren to play with. Even when she is told that the other boys parents like her son and accept him, that is still not enough for her. She wants nothing to do with her sons boyfriend, nor does she even want to accept the fact that her son is gay. She goes so far as to suggest that he see a doctor because he must be sick, believing his being gay is an illness like the flu or hay fever. It really hits home how out of touch some people can be, and how cruel they can treat others just because they have a different lifestyle choice.

It seems the best way to look at this film as a whole would be to consider it as a peek into the window of how one couple decides they are going to try to survive an apocalyptic event. We've seen plenty of films that are about the end of the world, and they are full of action, octane and bullets. This film just shows what those in between parts could be like. The film makes the most of its tight budget, being shot in only one room and partly on a phone camera. There are only three actors in the movie, and they all do a great job with the material they have. Acceptance of each other, no matter what our differences may be is the common thread that we all can share, if we want to continue onward and forward. That message is strong throughout.",1410393600,14,3454,4.114074074074074
6260925,2,B00IEA3LKE,Boring. Waste of money.,1410134400,,23,5.0
6260926,5,B00IEA3LKE,"This tale starts off with the viewer observing the natural love that exists between two people, recording their everyday interaction on a mobile phone, something that we have all done and still do. Life is normal and happy! Then the scene changes abruptly, to the aftereffects of some apocalyptic catastrophe that causes all power to fail and bodies lying in the streets, leaving Kai and Toby (our main characters), holed up in Tobis home, reviewing their life and slowly coming to terms with their current predicament and their future (if any).

 As a sci-fi & fantasy fan, I have wondered on occasion, if the end for us all was imminent, what would I do? For me, I would want to spend my last days, hours or minutes, with the person / people that I love and meet my end with dignity and not be alone. I believe that the vast majority of us would like to do this and you see this reflected in 1 Last Chance at Paradise. There are wonderfully touching interactions between two people who love each other as they slowly deal with what has gone wrong in their lives, through descriptive dialogue and flashbacks.  As for what exactly has gone wrong, youll need to watch the film, no spoilers with this review.

 Its fascinating to watch how two people work their way through their lives to how they have ended up where they are, with each other. Its a wonderfully engaging dialogue that makes you want to listen to the next word, sentence and in parts revelation. Youll experience a really well written example of Tobis coming out journey. How he has to deal with the uneducated, ill-informed prejudices from his mother.

 If you follow Wade Radfords films, this film and his character of Kai, is a real departure from his portrayals of the harsh reality of how people rationalise their actions to survive. 1 Last Chance at Paradise, gives you, the viewer, the opportunity to see sides of his character that you often don't see, a calm, loving, sensitive and fearful individual.

 What did I take away from this film? Be with the one that you love, enjoy life with the one that you love, because that is the time you are alive as it can all end, so suddenly. Also, its great to finish watching a film with a huge grin on your face. Thanks, Wade.",1407542400,17,2242,4.557213930348259

6260933,1,B00IEA3LKE,"The first and only chance/ review to dissuade you from watching this film. First off, I watched it because it is included in Amazon Prime. The story is good, but not convincing. I realize that the lighting is an effect to the plot, but it is overwhelmingly dark. The acting is almost good, however, feels like your watching a CAM Show.

6260953,1,B00IEA3LKE,"If you're an artist or a movie maker, you'll love this movie.

If you're just a person looking to watch a good movie, this move is about as moving as tree sap. Throw a couple of twinks in a room together and add a homophobic mom, that's what you have. This movie could have been summed up by taking a long porn about two broke twinks, taking out the sex and just leaving in the dialogue, and then slapping a title to it and calling it a movie.

I'm gay and I know what it's like to fall on hard times, but I never solved any of my issues by sitting around feeling sorry for myself. Fortunately my family doesn't care one bit about my sexuality, but I know that I never solved my problems by relying on just one homophobe. Also, if they're so broke, how did they afford so many candles? Who buys candles before buying food?
