8143832,4,B000I2KRXA,"Three bedrooms, two baths, one secret. The new woman on the block (Barbara Niven) has barely unpacked, when she learns of a grizzly murder that took place right under her roof.

Enter the handsome neighbor from across the street (Gary Hudson) who wants more than to borrow a cup of sugar. While he's igniting her passions, he's trying to hide that smoking gun, because the more she finds out about him, the more she's sure that new neighbors can be killers.",1390780800,,457,4.6419753086419755
8143833,3,B000I2KRXA,"This made for TV movie isn't anything special, but it's entertaining enough.  Lovely Barbara Niven and her retired lawyer dad Daniel J. Travanti move into a lovely new home in a small college town.  A neighbor informs Niven that a man was murdered, allegedly by his wife, in their house which enrages Niven but piques dad's interest.  Meanwhile Niven meets her hunky neighbor, Gary Hudson, who insinuates himself into her life.  It's not hard to see where the movie is going, with Hudson not all what he seems; he even talks to dead wife Lisa Zane who was having an affair with the murder victim and whom he also killed and faked her suicide.
Niven is appropriately vulnerable; Hudson nicely nasty and Travanti warm and cuddly.  Not a mastrpiece, but enjoyable.",1182038400,3,761,4.778625954198473
