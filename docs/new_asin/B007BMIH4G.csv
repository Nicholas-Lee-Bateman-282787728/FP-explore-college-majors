5073569,5,B007BMIH4G,"This is a 44 minute long Dora movie special featuring the older and newer version of Dora. I think its cute that Dora has finally grown up, especially since so maybe kids grow up still liking Dora.  It is nice to see how Dora has matured and grown, and gets along with actual girlfriends, rather than just animals and a map. It is a very cute movie special perfect for any Dora fan and just long enough to be a movie but not too long to cause kids to loose interest. Adorable animation and lessons.",1435276800,2,498,4.242105263157895

5073637,4,B007BMIH4G,"My 3 year old has fallen in love with Dora and the Explorer Girls. The movie is just as charming and educational as the regular Dora stories, but Nick Jr has stopped marketing this brand. This means there is no merchandise like toys or dolls to support its biggest fans. My daughter has been asking for a Dora the Explorer Doll and the only thing like that out there is a dora doll that connects to the computer. In addition, this is a limited eddition so the only sellers are through Amazon and they are way overpriced ($60-$90). My complaint is not with the video, I do think its entertaining and smart. My complaint is that it never took off for Nickelodeon and now there is nothing fun to buy along with the dvd!",1361836800,3,716,4.350746268656716

5073642,4,B007BMIH4G,"I ordered this Dora dvd thinking my granddaughter would love it. Well, it's not one of her favorites but maybe she'll enjoy it later. She's only three.  I like it and well worth buying for an older child that loves Dora.",1354752000,,220,4.365853658536586
5073643,5,B007BMIH4G,"There are no extras, but my 4-year-old doesn't care. She's loved this ever since it came on TV; I was so excited to see it on DVD, as we no longer have cable. She watches it often. The picture is good quality.",1354060800,,209,4.0

8513896,5,B007BMIH4G,"I bought this for my daughter because she was really enjoying Dora and Friends Into The City and there were no DVDs out yet.  This just looked like a movie version.  I think this came out BEFORE the newer show aired or it was like a pilot, to test to see how kids reacted to it.  It's all about the girls going to a Shakira concert and how they have to get there, all of the obstacles.  The cartooning is a little different and some of the friends are a little different, but my daughter loves it.  It's definitely a good movie to get if your kid likes Dora and Friends.",1444003200,,570,4.099099099099099
