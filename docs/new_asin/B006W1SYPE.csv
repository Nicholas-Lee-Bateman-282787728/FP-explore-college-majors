8505296,4,B006W1SYPE,"This black and white travelogue-styled documentary takes the viewer on an international journey to countries such as Peru, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, the Philippines, Colombia, Israel, Italy, etc. Jos Luis Guerin, director and filmmaker, interacts with people on the streets in both urban and suburban areas  focusing on lower-class locals with an even greater focus on the wacky human phenomena known as the street preacher. The frantic, desperate presence of these preachers brings an entertaining 'freak factor' to the film, adding balance and variety to what would have otherwise turned out to be a picture solely devoted to the commoner. Guerin has a knack for prompting his subjects to share their experiences, interests, problems, hopes, and concerns, all of which contribute towards making an earnest film that's interesting, amusing, (at times) bizarre, serious, playful, questioning, spontaneous, and relatable. If you enjoy unscripted documentaries with a sensitive, astute eye on people that reveals a deep understanding of humanity, I recommend Guest. (3.5 stars)",1511827200,,1070,5.645962732919255
