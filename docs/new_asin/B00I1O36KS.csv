6247104,3,B00I1O36KS,"The story centers around Jonathan (Garrett Hedlund), the wayward son who has flashbacks to his past. He has traveled from LA to be with his dying father (Richard Jenkins), who has been fighting cancer for 12 years. The family gets together, feuds, and then bonds in ways that were missing before. Sister Karen (Jessica Brown Findlay) studying law has filed a court injunction to prevent her father from being taken off the machines. This allows us to have a heart warming story about people and kids dying from cancer. Jonathan meets Meridth (Jessica Barden), a 17 year old with a death sentence as they bond smoking in the hallway.

In case you have Puffs left over from ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" this one is designed to help you finish the box, although it really failed to create that Puffs moment until the end when they over reach for it. Amy Adams has a role far smaller than her billing. This is your typical try to feel good about life Indie with acoustical accompaniment. The film needed a few more light indie moments as it seemed to be heavy just for the sake of being heavy. Good performances by the cast.

The film teaches us that smokers are criminals and they stink.

6247105,4,B00I1O36KS,"Andrew Levitas makes his screenwriting and directing debut in this little film LULLABY and for a first time effort, despite all the rough unfinished edges of the canvas, he gives notice of a man with a fairly keen perception of the complex interrelationships of dysfunctional families.

Jonathan Lowenstein (Garrett Hedlund) lives in Los Angeles attempting to become a singer of note and has been estranged from his wealthy New York family for years, always feeling as though he was unable to live up to his father's expectations.  One day, he suddenly receives word that his terminally ill father Robert Lowenstein (Richard Jenkins) wishes to be taken off life support after a 12 year struggle with lung cancer and has 36 hours to live. When he agrees to visit his father, he unintentionally sets up a family conflict with no easy resolution. His mother (Annie Archer) has been caretaker of Robert and is happy to have the family reunited: Karen (Jessica Brown Findlay), the younger sister in law school, struggles with resentment for Jonathan, Jonathan detests the fact that he must observe the dying wishes of Robert (including setting up Seder when Jonathan has a history of disregarding his Jewish heritage), cope with Karen's acerbic flairs, deal with a stranger Meredith (Jessica Barden) who is 17 years old and dying of bone cancer who shares her needs with Jonathan and he with her, and re-encountering his lost love Emily (Amy Adams). Some of the best moments are provided by Jennifer Hudson as the potty mouth bitchy nurse, Terence Howard as the attending physician who is to aids Robert's `assisted suicide', and Daniel Sunjata as a policeman who joins in the Seder. Though there are funny moments the story hangs on the subject of death and end of life situations, sharing the manner in which we evaluate our lives and our purposes in this life at that transformative moment of death of a loved one.

Though falling frequently into the overplayed anger/grief/sobbing triad the actors are very fine and they make the film worth watching. Grady Harp, July 14",1404518400,8,2069,4.956772334293948

6247110,1,B00I1O36KS,"Lullaby tells the story of a family ripped apart by tragedy as their cancer-stricken father makes the decision to end his suffering the next day. After about ten minutes of enduring this manipulative, seemingly-endless weeper you'll just wish he would go ahead and die already.

There are reasons why a film like this, with a desirable cast of Garrett Hedlund, Amy Adams, Richard Jenkins, Anne Archer, Terrence Howard, Jessica Brown Findlay, and Jennifer Hudson, sits on the shelf and gets unceremoniously dumped when nobody will ever see it. Lullaby is the kind of movie that practically begs for your tears, and it won't stop piling on the heartache until you give them up. Cliches, desperation, and artificially inflated subplots aren't enough to win anybody ever and chances are your eyes will remain dry as a bone.

Hedlund is one of the most boring leading men around but he's especially dull as entitled, obnoxious wannabe musician Jonathan, the kind of guy who lights up a cigarette on a plane then hits on the stewardess to get out of it. He also lights up in a hospital because...well, because he's handsome or something. Basically you want to kick him in the teeth right from the start, which makes it hard to sympathize when he comes to learn his long-suffering father Robert (Richard Jenkins) has decided twelve years is long enough to be battling cancer. He's decided to let the hospital pull the life support plug in the morning because the pain is too great. Jonathan's response? ""I can't handle this"". Yeah, way to show compassion, dude.

The rest of the family are either just as selfish or have no personality at all. The mother (Anne Archer) fits in the latter category. She cries a lot and is very Jewish. That's all we know about her and honestly it's probably best they didn't spend more time on her. Jonathan's sister is a lawyer who decides to file an injunction preventing her father from ending his life. Her big moment comes when she presents a legal argument on why it's a bad idea for her father to die. It's as ridiculous as it sounds.

Written and directed by newcomer Andrew Levitas, the film never really seems to have much point beyond ""everybody just be sad and mope a lot"". There are long stretches where Levitas seems to be pulling ideas out of a hat in an effort to pad out the length. So we get a weird stretch that focuses really heavily on the family's Jewish faith, although it doesn't really inform their character relationships in any tangible way. Jonathan starts hanging out with a spirited terminal cancer patient, played by the excellent Jessica Barden, who basically teaches him that s*** could be a lot worse so stop being a downer. And then there's Amy Adams as Jonathan's ex-girlfriend. Why Adams is in this movie is a mystery but her character is so thinly drawn that she only seems to exist on street corners. How many times can they run into one another just milling about on the street? And why should we care about them, anyway? His flirtations are especially troublesome considering what he's in town for. Hey guy, remember your dying Dad back at the hospital? This isn't the time for a hook-up. Attempts to lighten the mood are largely ill-timed and kill the few truly heartfelt moments which usually involve Jenkins' heartbreaking performance. If there's a reason to see Lullaby it's him.

Levitas smothers a deeply personal and compelling tale of life and death in Hollywood cliche, and unfortunately Lullaby never recovers.",1402876800,8,3486,4.793677204658902

6247129,3,B00I1O36KS,"I am brutally honest which gets me in trouble.  Only bought this movie cause Garrett Hedlund stared in it.  Otherwise I would not have bothered.  This is a routine, soap opera tale, minus any sexual encounters ( would have made it 5 stars if it did for me ). The story of some spoiled rich kids feeling it's their duty to visit dying father. Father, (Richard Jenkins) wants off life support. Daughter (Jessica Findlay) wants to argue a case of which she can prove the father's worth, etc so he will reconsider ending his life.  The wayward son, (Garrett Hedlund, all pouty, smoking hot , and smoking literally ) is back for how much cash will come to him to finance his "" no where  "" music career.  Mother ((Ann Archer) has typical weeping wife mode.  Kids get the shock of their life upon finding the father had other plans for his money so they get nothing.  OOOOh, didn't see that coming, now all self righteous and entitled.!!!!  So daughter begins forming her case, son smokes, mother weepy eyes.  A forced Jewish Seder, somehow does not appear to amount to nothing in my opinion.  Son's encounter with terminally ill teenager was awkward, fake Prom night, etc. In my opinion, when the son was faced with an extremely sensitive issue ( cleaning up bedridden dad's BM) you see for the first time the love father & son truly had for each other (though in the past it was never really spoken, just assumed). Looking at the son's face of disgust, then resigning himself to the task ( I was in medical field, I know about cleaning up) the tide turns.  The expression on son's face and in his eyes betrays the love he always had for father but was hidden.  Look at the tears , he loves him and does not want the father to die.  When he lays down beside the father to comfort him , it's all there, the love is there.  Good for you Garrett , you redeemed yourself.  Will not give away ending.  It was predictable and that was that.  Sorry, but this could have been a made for television movie.  Got ""R"" rating for language.  Again, don't hate me..... I was only ""in"" for Garrett,  otherwise I would not have bothered.",1411257600,3,2114,4.438961038961039

6247133,4,B00I1O36KS,"This is a personal family story about the decision of the father, Robert Lowenstein (Richard Jenkins), to end his time on life support within a forty-eight hour period. He has been fighting cancer for over twelve years with only a six month prognosis upon receiving his diagnosis.  Being familiar myself with the end stages of life while working in hospice care for a long while, I didn't choose to get overly picky with the different issues I saw that were errant with his hospital room procedures. I chose to concentrate on the circumstances this family was facing as I found this more important and what was concentrated on as the effort of the film. I am always interested in relationship movies and how families deal with different situations, this story is written and directed by a first-time at the helm, Andrew Levitas and highlights the Lowenstein family. I thought Levitas did a fine job showing what a family actually does go through.  There is a clashing of emotions, a tug on each of the family's part to make a plea for him to not stop his life support, and the patient's own resolution that he is tired of fighting any longer.

Robert and his wife, Rachel (Anne Archer), have been married for thirty five years and have two children; dissimilar with their opinions, stubborn and argumentative.  They did although have the chemistry two siblings naturally would.  A daughter, Karen (Rachel Brown Findlay), who is called the ""favorite"" by their son, Jonathan (Garrett Hedlund).  This slice of life story is told from the point of view of Jonathan.  He has always been the wayward type feeling that he could never make his father proud of him.  This is the reason that he went to Los Angeles to make his way as a singer while leaving his well-to-do family back in New York City.  He returns quickly upon hearing the news of his father's decision and to now be with his family and help in any way.  The more you see him, the more pain you can see growing within him.  He goes back to earlier years to pick up the past and show their, at times, dysfunctional family life then pulls it into the present.

The movie does get pulled way down emotionally although I didn't think that was odd whatsoever involving  this dark storyline, and as I watched the movie I couldn't view it any other way.  With that said, I could very much appreciate the ending even if some may find it obligatory, I found it opportunistic for support and much more positive emotionally for a family.  Karen presents a legal document to deny aid in the stopping of the support system against her father's wishes which allows for some time to pass.  Other parts are presented into the movie in small roles.  The nurse with the questionable attitude, Carrie (Jennifer Hudson), adds a kind of flippancy to a heavy script, she left me almost scratching my head wondering how she even had a position in the healthcare field.  I am still unsure how I feel about her part in the movie.

There are some subplots, one concerning a lost love of Jonathan's, Emily (Amy Adams), I didn't really see how she 'fit', a kind of a confusing time filler that uses a major star in a bit role.  Also, while in the hospital's pediatric cancer ward the seventeen year old, Meredith (Jessica Barden), gives a heart tugging portrayal of a young girl that realizes her death is imminent. She knows she will never kiss a man, go to her prom, or drive a car and the total weight of it is harder on her than she is first letting on.  She really grew on me from her introduction in the film and being in the hospital while Jonathan was there.  My heart felt for her having to deal with cancer during her young life.  Also, Robert's interest for his son to realize his Jewish faith and its traditions.  The family has a Seder together and there is an explanation of the correct way of grieving after death which is done by the eldest son.  I am personally unfamiliar with how the faith is practiced, but I was very interested with the explanations given and with their 'guest'.

As you can see, this movie is quite full with much going on including many parts of which heavily involve Jonathan and I have just brushed on some of the things that I found intriguing.  Overall, for a first venture by Andrew Levitas, I thought the movie was nicely done, a bit full with some loose edges, but a convincing story of a family dealing with a very deep and emotional time.  If you are in the mood for an uplifting film then this is not a good choice, but if your mood is for a reality within a family's structure, this works effectively if not poignantly .",1410134400,3,4599,4.528415961305925

6247140,4,B00I1O36KS,"I don't review movies as I don't know what to say.  Maybe they tried to put too much into a short timeline yet I have to say this was one of the better movies I have seen in a very long time.  I thought all the acting was great, never for a moment did I not believe the characters and that's unusual for me.  I wasn't sure I should watch it having lost one of my best friends to cancer this year yet in a way it made it more relatable.  Having watched my friend struggle through ups and downs over the years and what she went through trying to stay strong for her husband and friends.  Her ending was similar in a way as she opted to stop treatments and was gone within 48hrs of that decision with the last 36 or  so her resting comfortably and it made me feel it was very realistic with just her closest family remaining in the room waiting for her to die the last few hrs as in the film. Watching this film actually helped some with my closure over my personal situation feeling that the father in this movie dying was portraying what my friend and so many others dealing with this horrible disease are feeling when they realize no matter what the end will come and they both had some control over their final day.  Maybe I couldn't relate to the side stories yet those also felt very believable and the friendship between Jonathan and the young cancer patient was very moving though the scene where she showed up at the seder was kind of out of place and her role in that scene was maybe the one point where my mind moved out of the story wondering what her purpose was.  The other scenes with her and Jonathan and the kids were extremely touching and felt very real.",1406505600,,1670,4.213166144200627
6247141,2,B00I1O36KS,"It's hard to believe this movie could miss as much as it did, given the cast and the setting (New York at night mostly, which was cool),  Maybe it was because it lasted 2 long hours and felt like the 12 years referenced repeatedly in the movie (which might've worked really well if I was all caught up in the movie), or maybe it was the way the main cast poured on the instantaneous waterworks at the exact moment the Dad was unplugged (cue the melodramatics - ugh!) .  Whatever the reason, it just didn't work for me - I wanted to give Garrett Hedlund a hair clip for his annoyingly-in-his-face locks of hair (I get it, he's the sexy character, the handsome rogue son...complete with the hair...but after watching him rake his hair back for the umpteenth time, I wanted to reach through the screen and hand him a hair clip).  His sudden transformation from a shallow, narcissistic playboy to a loving, caring, deeper person was not credible, though the scene where he cleaned up his Dad had potential, it was not enough to make me believe he was a transformed man.
Jessica Barden's dying teen character needed a bra.  The whole wistful-dying-teen thing didn't work so well when she's walking around erotically poking through her silk sweater, leaving very little to the imagination.  Which emotion was the director trying to focus on with her?  Erotic or wistful-dying-kid?  The mix didn't work for me, especially when the 26-year-old character of Hedlund kisses her 17-year-old character.  Eww.  At least it didn't go farther than that and he wasn't interested.
Anne Archer added a classy touch, but her soggy character grew tiring after a while, especially with all of the histrionics and repeated ""you're my everything's"" back and forth between her and the Dad.
Richard Jenkins is always good, and there were some good moments in the film with him.
Jessica Brown Findlay (a true classic beauty) did a good job with her role as the lawyer-daughter.

Having been through a very similar life drama, I can appreciate the reality of the small moments of humor throughout the film, but in this case, they just didn't blend in well with the movie, it seemed they were additions to it.

If you're looking for a really good dying-parent drama that does hit all of the emotional checkpoints, check out ""Two Weeks"" with Sally Field.  That one will have you bawling every time and wishing it was longer.",1406073600,,2395,4.744578313253012
