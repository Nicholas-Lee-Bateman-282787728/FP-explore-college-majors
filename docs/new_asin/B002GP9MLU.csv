8369892,5,B002GP9MLU,"This vhs tape is amazing. Years ago I was stuck in a dairy diet funk. I quit cold turkey. It took me 1yr. but, I dropped 40lbs. and that was just doing the warm-up + dropping all dairy. I felt awesome, the mucus was gone, I could breathe and I could move my body w/o being in pain. Sure you're saying > oh, that's because you gave up dairy, but, no. The warm-up says> ""Your only as young as your spine is flexible."" I believe it. Plus if you have any breathing issues, please buy this! Your lungs will thank you. Years later I am buying a copy for my daughter. This is a routine everyone should add to their work/outs!
I just wish it was available in DVD format.",1287446400,2,662,4.1
