My husband, who has never danced a step in his life at age 72 is now, thanks to Shawn, dance crazy.....he loves to dance any where he has the opportunity and I am the fortunate spouse to be able to dance with him. We are enjoying the best moments of our lives dancing....thanks to Shawn Trautman. Thanks, Shawn.

8411534,5,B000GYCA76,"I have a number of Shawn Trautman's videos. His teaching method is clear and easy to understand.  As he teaches each step, he goes back to the beginning of the dance and repeats all steps up to the current one.  This helps the learner by giving more practice and by fixing in the learner's mind the sequence of the steps.  After only one time of viewing and practicing a video, I feel confident about being able to perform it on a dance floor.",1170115200,7,443,4.313253012048193

We used the 3 pack here to get comfortable with the different types of dances very quickly and learned them all in a weekend.  They don't do all the dances the same where we are, but what we learned in the Line Dance 101 DVD was how to put dances together very quickly based on all the different types of steps.  We found it very useful and fun to go through and practice all the dances.  This was a great investment!",1162684800,10,538,4.144230769230769
