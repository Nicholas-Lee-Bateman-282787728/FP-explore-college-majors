8406481,1,B003V8BO58,"This is not what I expected! Just a girl sitting in front of a camera talking. No props, charts nothing. Boaring!!! total waist of money. Even the info wasn't what I needed to hear. Take my advice, find another source of info. This one is lame.
Shipping was fast!",1297987200,,263,4.387755102040816
8406482,5,B003V8BO58,This video is a great introduction to Astrology. I am looking forward to future videos in this series that I am sure will deepen my understanding of the subject. I enjoyed every moment of it.,1280448000,,191,4.485714285714286
8406483,3,B003V8BO58,"I only gave this video three stars because of
the information. Which is good for
 an introduction to Astrology
 providing you can make out what is being said.
 The speaker is too far from the microphone and
every time she pauses between sentences there is
a flare up of loud static noise.
 If you try to turn up the volume
in order to hear the information better
the loud static only gets louder.
 The information is worth five stars by it's self.
 The overall quality of the video is only worth three stars possibly two.",1280361600,6,521,4.431578947368421
