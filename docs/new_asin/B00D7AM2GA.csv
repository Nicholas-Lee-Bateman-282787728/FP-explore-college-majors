5776483,5,B00D7AM2GA,"We only saw small previews of this series from Acorn media at the beginning of other DVDs. We are so impressed with the quality of British Mystery television series (Midsomer Murders, Last Detective, Morse, Lewis, Blue Murder, New tricks, etc.)  that we decided to risk it and buy this complete series DVD set of Frost. We have only viewed the first 2 episodes, and they may not be as good as the afor-mentioned series, but we do NOT regret the purchase. Even the mediocre British mystery detective series are so much better than the crap that passes for US quality programming (With exceptions of course). We are enjoying this series and look forward to seeing the many episodes left for us to view. We recommend it if you enjoy British television.

12/09/13 We finished the series last night. It is an excellent series. It has one of the few ""extra"" bonus items that was actually enjoyable to watch. I never realized the series ran for 17 years. One caution about the set we have, the DVD's were a b*tch to remove from its mount. I was afraid of snapping one while trying to remove it, but that's the packaging - nothing to do with the content.",1384560000,70,1146,4.558252427184466

5776485,5,B00D7AM2GA,"You've got to admit it: the Brits do a heck of a job with their TV crime stories; the characters seem so much more realistic than the ones on American TV.  The characters on American TV mostly look like Barbie and Ken (I mean, REALLY, how many female doctors and detectives wear 3"" heels on duty? or go to work with cleavage showing?) and you can pretty much bet on the show revolving around sex.  The British shows seem to have a great deal more content and a lot less sex, shoot-em-ups, and car chases!",1383782400,41,504,4.294736842105263

5776489,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I almost didn't purchase this set because of the several comments about disc quality.  The price, though, won me over -- and wow am I glad it did.

Apart from a few discs (3?) that had three instead of two episodes on it -- and those having way to much compression so the episodes would fit -- the image quality if very good. But more important is the show itself.

A Touch of Frost starts out strong, then goes through a couple of seasons where it becomes rather routine. But it them improves greatly into real who-dunnits filled with good writing, interesting people and interesting situations.

If you like Brit TV mysteries A Touch of Frost should be in your collection.  And this set is a true bargain.",1524873600,2,707,4.4921875

5776492,2,B00D7AM2GA,"The first season was interesting enough but by the fourth season we were bored. The episodes are too long and too predictable. It's the same thing again and again. I much prefer Foyle's War.

I do like David Jason as an actor but not in this series. If you want to see him at his most endearing, get The Darling Buds of May, a charming series with Catherine Zeta-Jones at her most beautiful and Pam Ferris as her wonderful mother. That's a series I can see over and over again.",1521763200,,477,4.3

5776498,2,B00D7AM2GA,"As a video professional I found it lacking. The production values as well as the video quality are poor, far below the quality of the Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis and other British productions. As for program content, it seems like they were going for a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Columbo and miss the mark on both. Frost is neither funny or competent. He is sloppy, abrasive, forgetful and just not very good at his job. The series gets boring after the first several episodes as it's just the same old thing over and over. There are many excellent British productions available on DVD, this is not one of them. I mostly lost interest after the first 6 episodes but will eventually watch all to see if they get any better. In mysteries (who done it's) the idea is to provide facts that support the conclusion and keep people guessing something this series doesn't have. Sadly I have to say that it's the poorest excuse for a mystery series that I've seen come out of Great Britain, content wise and technically. Can't even have any sympathy for the Frost character since he makes all of his own problems and is many cases is just plain OBNOXIOUS!",1519257600,2,1161,4.640776699029126

5776501,5,B00D7AM2GA,"This series is based on the novels of R.D. Wingfield set in the fictional English city of Denton.
This was on television from 1992 to 2010, ending only when the star retired at 68.
Each show is about two hours, usually dealing with a murder and issues of life in England.
Race, class play important roles as Frost battles the system, his inner demons and crime.
The shows are excellent, the acting and casting are first rate with no false notes.
There is an ongoing human story that makes even minor characters into real people.
The package is awful, a thin cardboard case with a stack holding 19 DVDs glued to a tri-fold cardboard holder.
However, the content is outstanding!",1518912000,,676,4.641666666666667
5776502,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I love this series. I can't get enough of the British detective shows. If you like detective programs, then this series is one you will like. Frost is a character that may seem a little unkempt but you will find him endearing. He makes me think of a Columbo type character, except you don't know who did it right at the beginning. This character had me smiling a lot.",1518739200,,367,4.333333333333333
5776503,4,B00D7AM2GA,"A Touch of Frost - Great Series
-Enjoyed watching the earlier episodes; they are more true to life and reflective on human behavior.  The varied crimes Frost investigated were always slightly balanced with humor and characterizations of genuine people.

Why only four stars...
-Great Series in a poorly put together DVD package.
--Don't know much about film and/or digital conversions to DVD or whatever....But on a few/several of the episodes, it was a struggle to look directly at the screen because the image was always slightly jumping or shifting.",1518048000,,552,5.191011235955056

This series can stand with the other two in writing, acting and production quality.  There is a reason I prefer watching British series more than what is on American TV - the British writers don't insult my intelligence and their writing is above the third grade level.

The acting and production of this series is first rate - given the time is was made.  It still stands up even all these years later,

Highly recommend this set.",1516320000,,600,4.622641509433962

Having done some research I found out why.
This is 66 hours on 19 DVDs , the uk version is on 29 DVDs.
The uk version is much higher quality so clearly the US version is squashed onto 19 discs to save disks,but the quality difference is huge.

5776518,5,B00D7AM2GA,"At first, I did not know what to make of the series. I had not read any of the books and only saw a glancing commercial. Therefore, I have been avoiding this series for quite some time.

The music by Ray Russell is unique so there is no good cubbyhole to place it. I am still not sure it is appropriate and will have to listen to Jon Hiseman's and Barbara Thompson's in the future.

The environment is a tad morose; not just the first story ""Care and Protection"" where DI Frost must care for his dying wife, but carries over to the other episodes as well.

So far, each episode has two parallel stories that may or may not be related. DI Jack Frost (David Jason, played Pop Larkin in the series ""The Darling Buds of May"") Is a devious no nonsense detective that will go a tad out his way and that of the law to get to the truce and solve the case in unique ways.

Of course, DI Frost has a standard self-preening nemesis, Supt. Mullett (Bruce Alexander) which actually sometimes inspires Frost to accomplish his goal in a unique manner.

We are not treated to a smorgasbord of blood and guts or dash cam auto chases. Although there may be a sprinkling of these, what really makes the series is the interaction between the different characters and a lot of times just the expression on Frost's face.

It only takes the first episode to get you hooked on the series. Yet instead of like a lot a series instead of fizzling out it only gets better as they have a feel for what they are doing.

I may give a little bit more the details on the individual stories in the future but for right now I do not want t to give away any of the details so that you may be surprised this series unfolds. However, anybody that is a good guesser can probably figure out the mystery before the end of the story. Sort of like watching the old Colombo movies, the real thrill is waiting for that light bulb moment where DI Jack Frost has figured it out.

5776522,5,B00D7AM2GA,"From the writer R.D. Wingfield comes ""A Touch of Frost"" based on the book by the same name. While Sir David Jason plays the character he was not the original cast for the role; Leslie Sands, a close friend of Wingfield first performed the role on radio. In fact, Wingfield was not fond of Sir David Jason for the role at all. Wingfield was no supporter of books or television he preferred radio. However, with the success of his books about Frost Wingfield was offered more dosh than he had achieved in writing.

Yorkshire Television (now ITV), produced the show using a one camera view system throughout the series. The show was not produced in high-definition and most of the episodes have a grainy edge to them. Which is unpopular with many people living outside the U.K. The main cast is comprised of some very notable performers such as; Bruce Alexander (Supt. Mullett), John Lyons (Sgt. George Toolan), and Arthur White (Sgt. Trigg) who is also Sir David Jason's real life brother. The show is set in the fictional village of Denton. However, its clear to most in the U.K. that West Yorkshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire are in fact the locations.

While many of the reviews written reflect on the ""style"" of how our television shows have the look of non-glamorous, non-glitz, its not by design. But rather by budget. Before the satellite dish came to the U.K. our television line up consisted of only four channels; BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, and if lucky Yorkshire. We do not have ""commercials or sponsors"" hence the Crown (government), collects a tax on TV's (a license) which every home must have, and the tax is not used to pay for big budget shows.

A Touch of Frost is a wonderful show. Other crime drama's to consider besides Midsomer Murders, and Inspector Morse are; Inspector Lewis, Prime Suspect (Helen Mirren), Silent Witness (Amanda Burton), The Bill, The Sweeney (For those who enjoyed actor John Thaw), and Cracker (Robbie Coltrane).",1504483200,3,1946,4.820359281437126

About 25-35% of the plastic in the box set is cracked/broken. As far as I am aware, the dvds themselves are not damaged, but I have not checked all of them. It was a little disheartening to have received the DVD set in this condition, but after I popped the first DVD in to watch, i soon forgot about the cracked plastic...at least for a short while anyway.

There are times when the shot is in complete focus and then other times where it looks like the entire episode was copied off of a copy, completely out of focus.  I expected this to be in an old format, (Not HD), but with the technology they have today, I would expect it to be a lot cleaner than it is, and at least in focus.  Also there are times when the sound is not clear.  I have seen this series on PBS in the past and everything was very clean, so I have to assume it is the quality of the disc's being sold or how they were copied.",1503792000,8,801,3.937888198757764

5776558,4,B00D7AM2GA,"Love this series more than any other detective drama. Unkempt, irascible, politically incorrect copper as brilliantly portrayed by Sir David Jason. I bought this series individually years ago. I saw this released in a much more compact size and had to buy it. I would gladly give this 5 stars but one thing annoys me. The subtitling is godawful. I like my subtitles with a yellow tint and to pretty much keep up with the action on screen.  Trifling I know but nothing to discourage your purchase of this classic set. SPOILER ALERT.  Season 15 is nearly unwatchable,  but only from an emotional standpoint. You get attatched to all these characters and they feel like family.",1487808000,8,674,4.793103448275862
5776559,5,B00D7AM2GA,"Enjoyed the Frost series very much even though we did get tired of his attitude and mouth full of sarcasm.  Perhaps that is actually the way people or police act in England I do not know, but, what I do know is that in the U.S. a smart mouth like his would have eventually cost him a trip to the dentist.  Only part of the series we did not like.  Acting was very good and gritty as you would expect and the gloomy weather added to the drama of the crimes and murder suspects Frost was after.  In spite of the constant sarcasm of Frost I give it a full 5 stars.",1486857600,2,561,3.982142857142857

I would give this a 5 star except for the Cockney  accents of some of the actors that I don't understand.  The man playing Frost is very believable, though not conventional, as a homicide detective in a small town. That is another thing I like about the Brits...their actors don't look made up or fake; they look like real people, just like the part they're playing, unlike American actors, so perfect in appearance.",1481328000,9,505,4.478260869565218

Some of the episodes are so sad but Frost always comes to a right conclusion, and when wrong, he fixes his mistakes and comes through.  I would have liked less of his romantic life which seems to make certain plots strain as he is so undecided about certain women who are so right for him and he just  misses all of the cues to make them right.  As a character he is very convincing and the scenes he does with his boss and his brother who is the Officer who controls the files for all the cases are perfect.  Enjoyable and London looks pretty good.  A definite set for a mystery fan.  Enjoy.",1472515200,8,725,4.2101449275362315

Despite the age of this series and having seen all episodes multiple times, we still enjoy it.  I believe this series won acclaim and awards in Britain.

It's Frost.  Solid plots, a good cast and well-written scripts - Frost has all of them and, frankly, they are what I expect to see in British television.

Unlike all the others, Frost has two differences the first of which is David Jason. He is an unlikely star who, on some level, doesn't even appear to the intellect or the skill to be a good detective.  But inside the slightly rumpled man whose suit pockets are stuffed with notes and whose desk is piled high with paper is the ability to read and understand the human beings he works with and the criminals he pursues.

The second difference is the constant undercurrent of hope that runs through Jason't character, his interactions and these story lines.  Despite his constant exposure to the underbelly of society, Frost maintains his humanity and a small but persistent understanding that life is not all bad.",1432598400,6,1064,4.632978723404255

5776694,1,B00D7AM2GA,"It took me a while and viewings of multiple episodes to get a handle on this series, and for me, it ultimately ends up as a flop. I love British crime/detective television and think most of the offerings are head and shoulders above popular American series such as CSI and, a truly annoying series, NCIS; that said, The Shield and Southland come to mind as standouts. For the Brits, I especially like Foyle's War and Wire in the Blood, and the genteel reservedness of Midsomer Murders has a charm that I find appealing, but Crime and Retribution is superb for many reasons, not the least of which is the inclusion of CCTV in the story lines. In a lot of the shows the fact that you are being watched and recorded almost all the time everywhere is glossed over, and the absence of this fact is glaring.

As to Frost, the pluses are the production values, good cinematography, and very decent characterizations of people caught up with the results of their choices that propel them to an often unforeseen and undesired end. So why only one star? Easy, Frost. He is imperious, blustering, rude, insulting, a petty thief and a petty criminal, violating procedure and often manipulating or planting evidence to hasten his winning his cases. And what's with his eating and snacking all the time, sometimes when he's interviewing potential suspects, he eats and eats and eats. Do the writers/producers/directors think this is witty? Charming? Has some point in it that carries the story forward?  Senseless. Also what's with all the yelling? HE IS SOMETIMES ALMOST SCREAMING AT HIS COWORKERS AND OTHERS when a more moderated volume would do just fine. He tones it down when he is interacting with characters who have suffered a loss or loved one, but otherwise, it seems he is trying to steamroll those around him with volume, not reason, logic or a superior strategic position. My jaw dropped when I watched the first episode of Season 3, titled Appropriate Adults, with the incomparable Timmy Lang; and experienced this excremental line at the 49min. 50sec. mark, directed at his assistant George as he is leaving a care facility after an interview; George is leaning on the car reading, and Frost barks at him, quote, ""What are you doing, composing an ode to colostomy?"" I doubt even John Waters would touch that one. Insulting and inexcusable. That said, I think Appropriate Adults is the best episode I've watched, but I don't know how much else I can take of this thoroughly unappealing character.",1409788800,6,2496,4.829439252336448

""Frost"" still my fave cop. 5stars!",1403740800,,181,4.6875
5776736,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I really enjoyed this entire series and became very ""attached"" to the character of Frost.  Am delighted with this purchase!",1403395200,,123,5.15
5776737,5,B00D7AM2GA,"One of the greatest shows produced in Great Britain.  David Jason (now Sir David, the British are so classy with their titles given out to every everyone, what are the requirements, glad to be an American).  Great show and great acting and plots.",1400630400,2,246,4.6976744186046515
5776738,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I was so enthralled with this series that I hated for it to come to an end. The characters were so ""human"" it was easy to identify with them. The mystery and detective work was superb. My attention was captured through the complete series. Well worth the
price which was very reasonable.",1400544000,3,287,4.538461538461538
5776739,5,B00D7AM2GA,"This 1980's British series has excellent stories and characters. Lead actor David Jason is at his best in some of the most mundane seeming moments and with personal interactions with a strong supporting cast. Occassionally, the plot gets too contrived, but the detail and atmosphere of Denton is worth the viewing every episode.",1399766400,,328,5.2075471698113205
5776740,5,B00D7AM2GA,"what a great british program!  i enjoyed watching the entire series of a touch of frost.  the quality of the dvds is excellent.  if you enjoy detective stories, you won't be disappointed with this series.  david jason took charge of the role and became the character of DI Frost.  i enjoy british television series as they are intelligent, well written, and the actors are multi-talented.  i  think this series ran for 17 years....the last show of the episode gives an alternative ending.  apparently they couldn't decide but eventually chose one.  you can watch the alternative one as well.  just be aware, his constant eating of indian food may cause cravings and you'll find yourself looking for an indian restaurant or making some for yourself.",1399420800,18,748,4.959677419354839
5776741,5,B00D7AM2GA,"We are great fans of Midsommer Murders, but we've gone through the whole set..., twice.  Newest season won't be out until July 2014, so we were looking for something to fill in.  Liked the reviews for A Touch of Frost and thought we'd give it a try.

David Jason is just perfect as Frost - rumpled, grumpy, smart, lucky (he counts on it), opinionated, fair, disdainful of authority, brave, and unlucky in personal relationships (his own fault).  We are into season three and they keep getting better.  Not Midsommer, but a nice ""old school"" British series with a great actor inhabiting a great character. A much less upscale part of the country than Barnaby would recognize, but with enough humor to keep things from bogging down.",1398470400,,730,4.761904761904762
5776742,5,B00D7AM2GA,Love it and love David Jason in all his roles.  Good stories that keep you guessing. You get to know all the regulars and bring back favorites who put in appearance in beginning of series.  The British know how to make mysteries.,1396137600,,229,4.428571428571429
5776743,5,B00D7AM2GA,A Touch of Frost is a fantastic British mystery series.  It's one of our favorite series and has been for many years.  The players and the plots.,1395532800,,145,4.333333333333333
5776744,5,B00D7AM2GA,I have enjoyed the Touch of Frost mysteries since I saw my first one on PBS.  It is wonderful to find them all in one place at such a reasonable price.  My husband and I both love watching them and will spend many happy hours watching them over and over  again any time we want.,1394150400,,278,4.0181818181818185
5776763,5,B00D7AM2GA,This was a great price and really good series to own. I checked around and this was the very best price.  I ordered one for me and one for a gift.,1393891200,,146,3.7096774193548385
5776764,3,B00D7AM2GA,"Whoever is responsible for the sound on this needs to be paddled. Some programs are ok except for the intro music, some the actual sound of the actors is just too low............ my husband said ""sound by Lucas"" but it is not amusing to have to wrench around on my mixer for each individual program and then return it to my normal settings.
Over and above that problem, seeing Frost in one grouping is wonderful. We both really like David Jason's irreverent Frost and his inside jokes and his general calm demeanor. A good series.",1393113600,8,530,4.589473684210526
5776765,5,B00D7AM2GA,"An Anglophile for my entire life, and an afficianado of British mysteries as well, I was gleeful when my husband surprised me with this collection as a Christmas gift. There is not a ""fine line"" between creative crime fiction and feasibly constructed story lines today. There is a large gap! Currently, in most such productions, female medical examiners with long hair wear tight dresses and totter about on five-inch heels; young, sexually driven detectives fight the good fight with violent actions and equally ugly language; and all criminals are monsters from infancy or spoiled, but handsome scions of too wealthy families. David Jason is an actor of substance, physically incapable to jumping from great heights onto a fleeing villain, but certainly able to portray and expand the life of a complex character. Now that we have watched all of the episodes, we shall start again and again and notice even more of the details.",1392681600,15,929,5.038961038961039
5776766,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I haven't watched all of them yet and it will take some time to watch 66 hours of detective mysteries, but Jack Frost is a great detective.  I have never seen a detective who has had so many partners!  Every episode he has a new partner as though he is a trainer or teacher and I think he feels that way too.  He is a very loving and caring man, but can be very high strung when need be.  I think the thing I like the most about Frost is his humor and the fact that he won't let his boss intimidate him what so ever!  I haven't regretted it once for buying the complete series and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest.",1391472000,,620,3.967741935483871
5776767,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I had only seen a few, a few years ago, on BBC or PBS.  I LOVE this series.  My sister LOVES this series.  My husband LOVES this series.  We are glad to have to see again in a few years time ...",1390867200,,194,3.5476190476190474

5776769,5,B00D7AM2GA,"I just finished watching over 60 hours of this excellant series.  It is a most satisfying british detective series.  I feel I knew the characters.  The series spans, what.. 17 years.(?)  You watch the people age, grow & mature.  The special feature at the end of the series was really a good experience also.  Over the years, I caught a few episodes on pbs, but this was so great to watch them all in sequence.  At some point in the future, I'll take time and watch them all over again.",1389225600,,486,4.333333333333333

5776772,5,B00D7AM2GA,Great Detective series 19 discs of all episodes no ads does not matter how many times you watch Frost you get something out of it,1386892800,,129,4.2
8590285,1,B00D7AM2GA,"The series is great and i love watching it but one  of the discs doesn't  work (Disc17) it won't read on my player but all other discs play so its not the the reader, also one of the discs is labelled incorrectly and it is actually duplicate of an earlier disc in the series pack so two discs have the same episodes but have different disc numbers on them, i miss out on 4 of the series episodes - so disappointing as you don't find this out this until you use the discs which was over many weeks..
Cant return it from where i am as it would cost just as much to buy another series. So pissed of about this will never buy DVD's through amazon again and recommend others should be  aware about this supplier.",1531008000,,707,4.145985401459854
