2608322,5,B00004CYR8,"I've seen the movie before, it's great. However half way through it, the DVD started messing up, stopping, starting picture freezing. It jumped from where she meets Mrs. Thorndike in the car on the base, to her being in France. So I missed all the parts in between like her jumping out of the plane while she was being attacked, Mr Thorndike trying to send her to Greenland. Before and after are OK in this DVD. But, will not purchase from this person again. I do not want a refund it's too much trouble and I'm not mailing it back.",1509148800,,532,4.33

2608331,5,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn. She's one of the best comic actors. I really wish she'd produce and star in another film like Private Benjamin. I first saw this film way back in the day. What strikes me now, as a woman of a certain age, is how ahead of her time she was. When you consider the issues she raises in this film, it's clear what a true feminist she was, is.  Her portrayal is brilliant.  And that last scene so memorable.",1502668800,,414,4.1625

2608353,5,B00004CYR8,"Definitely an enjoyable film for fans of Goldie Hawn, whose insight into women's issues is made obvious through a very humorous and thoughtful treatment of a woman entering the world of military obligations and marriage. Whether realistic or not, the moments of resounding truth are not missed by the observant viewer, if that's what we perceive.
I first saw this movie when I was 18; as an older person, having lived through the women's movement that still works for a better understanding of women's issues, I see the message in this story with even more clarity.
Private Benjamin is an important film in the case for equality and fair treatment towards women.",1481932800,,662,4.919642857142857

2608358,3,B00004CYR8,"One of my all time favorite movies. But I should have looked up the term ""Full Screen Edition"" before making this impulse purchase. This film has been cropped like they do to movies when they show them on TV. In other words, it's square on the screen and not wide like in the theater. Plus the transfer is incredibly grainy.

Private Benjamin, however, updates the humor to more modern times, when studio bosses didn't flip out over every little inference.  Hawn does a great job in the role, but no one is better than Eileen Brennan.  She purrs with delight each time she gets the chance to grab a 'gotcha' moment on Private Benjamin.  Very funny stuff and holds up well.",1468972800,,414,4.63013698630137

2608385,3,B00004CYR8,The price makes the movie worth buying. I adore anything starring Goldie Hawn but this is one of my least favourite movies of hers. Hawns acting was wonderful it was purely the story i didn't like. I enjoyed the beginning about how she got in the army and i though the whole movie would be a comedy of her evolution through the army and it was for the most part. It started out strong and finished weak it was like they took two separate stories and put them together. I think it would have been better if the whole movie was her in the army not broken into basically two parts one distinctly comedic and the other a love story. But for the price it's a movie worth time watching.,1463875200,,680,4.2384615384615385

2608391,3,B00004CYR8,"Rich Jewish woman is on her second marriage's honeymoon when her husband dies on top of her. She then takes the advice of a stranger and enlists in the Army. You see her slowly adjust and ""become a woman"".

Pure feminist movie where all men are rapists, liars, con artists, abusers, misogynists, promiscuous, etc. The makers of the movie try to sugar coat it by making it ""funny"". There is also the subtle have vs have-not pro-communism anti-capitalism in this movie too.

What I found amazing was that as a kid my parents would never take me to a R rated movie like this of course. But not long after it completed its run in the theatres the movie was cleaned up and shown on TV. From seeing it on TV back then, I fondly remembered this movie as a zany funny movie and had a good impression of Goldie Hawn. I couldn't wait to see it here after ""buying it"". How disappointing. VERY disappointed I was. All these years later, I see the full uncut movie and saw what a horrible profane mess of a movie with a horrible message (or messages) it really was. The only thing that saved this movie was Eilean Brennan and young Hal Willams. You also get to see a beautiful man specimen in his youth too--Craig T Nelson. It reminds me of songs on the radio, esp rap songs. They a re cleaned up on the radio and you think ""I like that"". So you download or buy and then the filth that is in it horrifies you that y ou gave money in support of it. I heard a woman talking her friends in a record store about 10 years about about an Eminem song. It was the same thing. The one woman wanted to buy it but was hesitant. She said she heard it on the radio and it was fine. She said if that was the only OK one that OK. But the friend said what I just said about this movie--they always clean them up for the radio. You never know what it will sound like on that CD.",1461110400,,1848,4.1305555555555555
2608392,5,B00004CYR8,I watched it again after many years. It is still hysterically funny.,1459296000,,68,4.75
2608393,5,B00004CYR8,"One of my favorite movies of all time.

Most have said this movie is about a coddled Jewish American Princess who joins the Army on a whim during her grieving over her husband's untimely death on their wedding night, and who learns independence through the experiences that follow.  I think that is true, but you could ALSO say this movie is about a young woman (regardless of whether her family was upper, middle or lower class) who ends up being disappointed by almost everyone important in her life, and mostly because of their selfishness and misogynistic, horn-dog ways.

1.  Judy's DAD is aloof, arrogant and cold to Judy and treats her like a second class citizen bc she is a female.
2.  Judy's MOM is weak and only mildly supportive of Judy, occasionally talks about Judy behind her back, is concerned mostly with cowtowing to her husband and maintaining her marriage to her husband who is her financier, and sees Judy's struggles as opportunities to engage in her OWN self-pity parties for her OWN attention, rather than really caring about Judy.
3.  Judy's HUSBAND is a selfish horndog who only cares about using Judy for sexual gratification; he dies of a heart attack on their wedding night during sex (after earlier making her perform oral sex on him in their limo outside of their wedding reception while she was still in her wedding dress).
4.  On a grief-fueled whim, Judy thinks about joining the Army to see the world, support herself as a young widow, and not rely on her father.  Judy's Army RECRUITER flat out lies to her about the assignments and accommodations in the Army -- in order to make his recruiting quota that month, while pretending to care about her awful circumstance of being a brand new widow.
5.  Judy's female Army recruit BUDDIES are jealous of her looks, background and class, and instead of being supportive like most MALE recruits are with each other (knowing they may be in battle with them someday), are either talking about her behind her back, kiss-ups jockeying for favor from higher ups at her expense, lying ex-con Army blanket thieves who want to beat her up, or are whimpy newbies always being nosey about her personal information and trying to make her question her every move.
6.  Capt. Doreen Lewis, her Basic Training LEADER (and supposed mentor) is bisexual and knows Judy is heterosexual, so knows better than to put the moves on her, so instead she mistreats her every chance she gets (which Judy is too naive to even piece together) and rather than try to help Judy blossom as a soldier, tries to wash her out of Basic Training by colluding with Judy's parents, and when that doesn't work, she competes with her in war games rather than celebrate Judy's victory with her team.  As a result of Capt. Lewis' poor leadership skills (especially with regard to her nonsensical and unfairly personalized mistreatment of Pvt. Judy Benjamin who is a rising star), rampant alcoholism, Capt. Lewis is reassigned to SHAPE in Belgium, where she takes up with a German female at work.
7.  Thinking that winning at war games won her a permanent spot with the Thornbirds following Army training, an elite group that jumps from airplanes, she soon realizes the creator of the group, Judy's new ARMY SUPERIOR, Col. Thornbird, a married serial fillanderer with a cowtowing clueless wife (very similar to Judy's own mother), only arranged for her to be added to the group so he could have sex with her.  He waited until their group was doing an airplane jump and after the other Thornbirds had jumped out, leaving them alone, and he attempted to allow her to forego the jump she was fearful of doing IF she would have sex with him.  However, Judy gets over her fears and jumps to avoid her would-be rapist.  Later she threatens rape charges and obtains transfer to SHAPE, Belgium, a prime assignment to Judy bc it is where her recent love interest lives.
8.  That LOVE INTEREST is a very wealthy and attractive French gynecologist she coincidentally met while on weekend leave at a bar in New Orleans near the Biloxi Army post where she was undergoing Basic Training.  She connected with him in France upon transfer to SHAPE and their relationship got serious fast, they planned their wedding and contemplated children.  However, at a dinner together he slipped a Prenuptial Agreement written in French in front of her to sign, which she tearfully did, simultaneously realizing her fiance might not be as emotionally invested as she.
9.  Working at SHAPE, she runs across her old nemesis, Capt. Lewis, who was intent on harming Judy.  Capt. Lewis stalked her and found out about her sexy rich French fiance, and dug up dirt on him, based on flimsy information.  Capt. Lewis inflated the importance of the information to Judy's superiors and got them to force her to choose between the Army or her fiance.  Even if she were willing to cut ties with her fiance, she would have to work in the same building as Capt. Lewis for the foreseeable future, and there would be no end to the hijynx Capt. Lewis would visit upon her going forward (unless, of course Judy was willing to DATE her...).
10. Having thrown away her military career for her French fiance, Judy threw herself into the role of future housewife.  However, she soon realized he was also an arrogant serial fillanderer, which she discovered when she found a necklace belonging to the sexy young hapless and ineffective French MAID, that he hired, in their bed.  The one person she had hoped she could finally trust, rely on, and obtain some support from, thought of her as just an addition to his collection, and not an actual person.

On the day of their wedding, the groom was late, finally admitting he went to the apartment of his former lover whom he had an obsession over (so much so that he had already convinced Judy to change her hair and clothing to be more like her during their courtship -- although Judy wasn't aware that that was the reason he talked her into the changes).  While her arrogant father, two-faced pity party mother, and a couple of semi-worthless old Army buddies were in the congregation (having flown to France to attend her wedding), she got an epiphany and declined to say ""I do.""

At this point it dawned on her that everyone in the room had disappointed her deeply, and she wasn't going to let it continue.  Embarrassed, her fiance tried to make her go thru with the vows, but when she wouldn't he launched into assassinating her character in front of her family and Army buddies, referring to the time they met in New Orleans as her ""picking up men in bars"" -- which was odd coming from a serial fillanderer...  She put her Basic Combat Training to good use and socked him in the jaw knocking him into some seated people in the congregation.  Her family and friends gasped in shock (not realizing all she had put up with from her fiance) and Judy walked out alone, presumably to get a taxi and leave for the USA.  (And presumably not to live again with her parents.)  The movie doesn't explain Judy's future plans.  It's even possible she planned to stay in France and obtain dual citizenship.

Everything that happened to Judy was because she took people at their word, but they weren't worthy of her trust, even when it was their position (parent, recruiter, Army superior, fellow recruit, boss or fiance, maid) to BE in her corner.  She finally decided to rely on herself, but in reality that doesn't usually work out either.  I wish the movie had indicated that Judy finally decided to rely on God.  But it was a great movie.  The point and focus isn't about the fact that the first 20 years of her life happened to be in an upper middle class household, or that she was Jewish.  After all, after her husband died, she COULD have stayed at her parents' house indefinitely, and not joined the Army.  The point is that virtually no one in her life that she should have been able to trust was trust worthy, and in most cases, it was because they were selfishly pursuing their own agenda and/or who saw her as only a sex object because she was a pretty blonde.",1458691200,,8096,4.665963431786216

Man, I'd forgotten how hilarious Goldie is in this movie. I enjoyed it emmencly! Goldie Hawn plays this bit soooo well that there is no way anyone could have played that any better!

A slick recruiter talks Judy Benjamin into joining the army. Judy is a newly widowed, spoiled rich kid. A clueless blond whose husband dies on top of her on their wedding night! She is the epitome of the stereotypical trophy wife. She is awash in grief and realizes that besides being married, she doesn't have any other future. In a desperate attempt to cope, she tells her tale on a radio show. A caller tells her that he has the answer to allll her problems. The recruiter promises her spas, condos, yachts, and a healthy way to get away from it all...And that she can quit ""just any ol' time"" if she doesn't like it...yes there is a sucker born every minute. But what she gets instead is a big dose of some guts and self esteem throughout this movie. If you've never watched this movie, do yourself a favor. Watch this version of 'G.I. Jane'.",1400025600,,1189,4.404545454545454

2608500,5,B00004CYR8,"I loved this movie the first time....years ago.  I still love the message.  Even though we live in a different decade from when this was made, girls still are pushed into the man-pleaser role regardless of the media claims to the contrary.  Case in point:  look at the clothing styles promoted for our girls:  there was a time that current fashions would have been  a sign of a girl who was ""easy"", or tacky, or what is now called a ""ho"".  It's always refreshing to see the transformation of a girl when she realizes she is being diminished and takes control of her life. If you are a woman, you will identify in so many of the manipulations. The wedding scene in this movie is a great climax.

I think Goldie Hawn is great in this movie. The role seemed to have been made for her. It's a cute satire military movie. The boot camp scenes are nice and were near like my boot camp experience in the Navy. But then, I doubt Goldie would still play the role as Private Benjamin if she had to chop off her hair. I think Eileen Brennan is great in this role as well. Eileen, ""The Couch"" and Goldie is the reason why we rewatch this film. TMC channel was showing it today to celebrate Eileen's career because she passed away on July 28th (my birthday actually - kind of dampers that).",1376697600,,591,4.230088495575221

Jim Ballard(Harry Dean Stanton)convinces her that military life to be glamorous, she gets a rude wake up call in boot camp after getting in trouble constantly, especially by Judy's hard-nosed superior officer Capt. Doreen Lewis(Eileen Brennan)prompting her to want a quit the Army, but then Judy has a change of heart and decides to stick it out leading her to a series of adventures that eventually lead her to a promotion and a transfer to Paris, France.

During Judy's time in the service, while being stationed in Europe she meets and has a short-lived romance with a dashing French doctor Henri Tremont(Armand Assante)and ends up leaving the service when Capt. Lewis gives Judy an ultimatum to choose between leaving the service and leaving Henri after Henri proposes marriage to Judy, but then Judy ends up walking out on their wedding ceremony when she discovers that Henri has been unfaithful by having an affair with his maid, but Judy also comes to the realization that she's capable of doing whatever she wants and doesn't need Henri for it either especially after Judy walks out on him at the altar to go live her own life and make a new beginning.

PRIVATE BENJAMIN was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a leading role(Goldie Hawn), Best Actress in supporting role(Eileen Brennan), and Best Writing done directly for the screen in the Spring of 1981.

Additionally, PRIVATE BENJAMIN was such a big smash at the box office that they had decided to make it into an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning television series using the same name, which starred Lorna Patterson as Private Judy Benjamin replacing Goldie Hawn along with Eileen Brennan reprising her role as Capt. Doreen Lewis and Hal Williams reprising his role as Sgt. L.C. Ross from the film to the TV series which ran on CBS from 1981-83.

This hilarious flick also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.",1232409600,,2236,4.860892388451443
2608545,1,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn was hilarious in ""Foul Play"" when I first saw it all those years ago and she shows another dimension to her acting and now screenwriting in ""Private Benjamin"".  I remember years ago when I first saw this that I laughed a lot more but I guess it's understandable as very few comedies age very well as they tend to be dated to the times that they were written for and this film is no exception.

Thankfully this film is not just a comedy as it still retains its ability to entertain and amuse despite the time-decayed nature of most of the jokes because it is also a very good story about how a spoilt, dependent young woman becomes emancipated and self-confident to be better able to identify various attempts to exploit and manipulate her with her passing the final test at the end with the jerk she's supposed to marry.  Goldie Hawn shows in this film that she's not just a comedianne but that she's also a serious actress and the scenes when she is upset and reaching out for help on the radio chat show for example were quite moving.  This is the best Goldie Hawn film that I've seen.

As a result, the film retains its ability to still amuse and entertain despite the poor aging of most of the gags.  Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd version of the film is very, very poor.  Both the picture (especially the picture) and sound quality are abysmal and there are no special features worth mentioning.  Fans of the film should give this particular dvd version a wide berth and wait for either a standard or Blu-ray format with much improved picture restoration and sound quality remastering with at least 5.1 surround sound options in an anamorphic widescreen format to surface.",1230854400,,1697,4.577557755775578

2608547,4,B00004CYR8,"The service comedy is a genre almost as old as cinema itself and, whether it's Charlie Chaplin or Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe in the trenches, Andy Griffith befuddling his sergeants, the Carry On team on the assault course or Steve Guttenberg and co at the Police Academy, has an almost immutable formula that is never, ever departed from: through mildly comic misadventure misfit(s) find themselves in the army/navy/air force/police force, are hopelessly unprepared for the harsh realities of basic training, fumble every task yet somehow come out of it all as the perfect soldier/sailor/airman/cop and prove themselves in a mildly comic baptism of fire. Private Benjamin does absolutely nothing to fix what ain't broke, contenting itself to offer the odd slight tweak and flavoring with a mild dose of Jewish humor as Goldie Hawn's sheltered princess finds herself talked into joining the `new' army by Harry Dean Stanton's smooth-talking recruiting sergeant after husband Albert Brooks dies in the throes of passion before the honeymoon even starts (""Do you remember what the last thing he said was?"" asks his distraught mother, eliciting the reply ""I'm coming."").

While it's a given that there are no surprises whatsoever, it's one of those comedies that manages to be pretty consistently funny throughout even if there aren't many really big laughs out of sheer likeability. Hawn's character is not too bright but not too Hilton with it - her character arc is not just from dependence to self-reliance but more importantly from not being able to understand why Jill Clayburgh walked out on Alan Bates in An Unmarried Woman to being able to make the same choice herself, in the process tackling sexism rather more effectively than G.I. Jane did 17 years later. Eileen Brennan is clearly having a ball as the obligatory sadistic training officer out to make her life hell and there's a quietly impressive supporting cast filling out the ranks as well as a memorable Bill Conti score. It only really misses its step slightly in the scenes where her Monsieur Right (Armand Assante) rather clumsily turns out to be Monsieur Wrong at the end, as if afraid of losing the audience's sympathy long after she's won them over, but not enough to squander the goodwill it's earned by then.",1202860800,,2286,5.031662269129288

2608550,4,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn gives an astounding performance as Judy Benjamin, a spoiled rich girl whose second husband just died six hours into their marriage.  Not knowing where to go from there, she calls a radio call-in show to get advice from people.  In the end, she meets an army recruiter who tells her to enlist.  Judy does so, but only because the recruiter glamorizes the lifestyle to the point that he flat out lies.  When she gets there, she gets a rude awakening.

The first half of the movie is the best half, highlighted by many slapstick fish-out-of-water scenes.  You'll laugh hysterically at them, especially the scene where she is forced off the bus.  Eileen Brennan is also great as Judy's commanding officer, a tough-as-nails and unsympathetic woman.  What makes the film far from perfect is the second half.  Judy decides to be the best soldier she can be, and becomes the best out of them all.  When that is all said and done, the movie then becomes a romantic drama with some chuckle-inducing moments, but nothing that could be considered a guffaw.  It also tends to clash with the first half of the movie, not making the movie as satisfying as it could have been.

Still, despite some glaring flaws, Private Benjamin is a good movie with a good story to tell.  Unfortunately, what was probably a pretty daring look at gender rolls for its time has gotten really stale.  If you overlook that, though, the movie is very entertaining.  It's not quite as funny as it's made out to be, but it's pretty close.",1160438400,,1512,4.652830188679245
2608551,4,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn has long had a knack for comedy.  ""Private Benjamin"" is one of her best comedies.  The ""Jewish Princess"" persona wears a little thin in a few places, but most of the time the comedy works well.

Judy Benjamin (Hawn) has led a pampered life.  We learn this early in the movie when Judy becomes upset that the upholsterer has failed to find an obscure color for an ottoman.  The movie proceeds to develop Judy's character as that of a woman that has received excessive luxuries from everyone in her life, with the only requirement that she be obedient.  As we join the movie, it seems that Judy is about to get her life long wish.  She is about to marry a man of great promise, her parents are thrilled, and she has tons of expensive wedding gifts.  Unfortunately for Judy, the wedding night exertions are too much for her new spouse, and Judy finds herself a newlywed widow.

Judy learns that she is good for little.  She is non-functional as a secretary.  Judy is spoiled to the point of absurdity.  She is unable to cook.  I doubt she knows how to clean house.  Judy realizes she needs to get her life moving along again, but she does not know how.  A fortuitous phone call has Judy visiting an Army recruiter, where she learns that modern army life is full of beautiful bases, condos, and yachts, not to mention great medical benefits.  Judy believes the recruiters picture of Army life, and heads off to basic training.

Basic training is filled with the lovely accommodating people that you might anticipate.  Judy quickly learns that her recruiter misled her more than a lot.  Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) initially makes Judy's life a living hell.  Judy wants to quit the Army, but a visit from her parents makes Judy realize that she is tired of people pushing her around, so Judy turns into a model soldier.

Judy turns misfortune into embarrassment for Captain Lewis.  Judy catches her current love interest Captain William Woodbridge (Craig T. Nelson) in a rather interesting position with a fellow recruit.  Judy and a small band of misfits manage to take guard duty of a swamp and turn it into a major embarrassment of Captain Lewis, but glory for Judy and her gang.  After Captain Lewis punishes the barracks once more for all the embarrassment she has received, Judy and her fellow recruits get their revenge with a little bit of dye.

Judy's life seems to have hit a turning point.  She is in charge of herself and doing well.  She turns another embarrassing incident into a European assignment.  Judy soon finds the man of her dreams, again.  Unfortunately, Captain Lewis also has an assignment at the same facility, and she still wants to make Private Benjamin's life as difficult as possible.  Life becomes very interesting for Judy as she decides how to stay in control of her life.

This movie has far more humor than my mellow review would intimate.  This movie has numerous one-liners that bring smiles all the way to serious laughs.  Judy Benjamin complains to Captain Lewis that she signed up with a different Army, the one with the condos and the yachts.  When a drill sergeant tells Private Benjamin that she is only permitted to stop running if she is puking, she does; on his shoes.  When Captain Lewis tells Judy that she is not fit to wear an Army uniform, Judy replies that she has been trying to tell her that.

Goldie Hawn does an excellent job of bringing the role of Private Benjamin to life.  She performed so well that she was nominated for a Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Eileen Brennan was also outstanding, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.  Both nominations were well deserved.

This movie is rated R because it has several scenes that are bit risqu&eacute;.  Considering today's standards, an R rating seems a little excessive.  Regardless, this movie is not a family movie.

The occasional bumpy spots in the movie are more than compensated for by the humor of the rest of the movie.  This movie is one that I watch when I want light comedy with guaranteed funny jokes.  After watching this movie a half dozen times, I suspect I will watch it many more times.  Now, if they would release this movie in a wide screen format, this movie would be even better.",1155513600,,4246,4.638926174496644
2608552,5,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn is just perfect as Judy Benjamin, a young woman who is torn to pieces after the death of her husband just six hours after saying their vows.  Yes her husband dies right in the middle of making love to her.  That's enough to make anyone a little nuts.  While in this state of anxiety she calls up a local radio station under the persona of Jessica and laments about her situation.  While the radio receives dozens of callers wanting to give their advice, it's one in particular that gets Judy thinking, and with a little persuasion she up and joins the army under the false impression that she'll have her own condo and, if things prove too hard for her, she can just up and quit whenever she wants.  Little does she know, upon arriving at her base, she'll be bunked with quite a few other women (some of which are hardened criminals) and there will be no quitting for three years.

Worse yet is her Captain, Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) who's determination is to make Judy's stay complete hell.  Upon arriving Judy complains, she whines and fights and complains, tries to escape and, yes...complains, but after a meeting with her family and she understands just what they think of her she decides to take things a little more seriously, and she actually becomes quite good.

Through the course of the film she becomes a Thornbird and then, through no fault of her own, is transferred to the international theater in France where she rekindles a relationship with a French Obi-gyn (who obviously knows what he's doing if you get my drift) and then her relationship with her Captain who just so happens to be working in the same building as Judy, still determined to make her suffer.  The remainder of the film has Judy making life altering decisions as to whether she wants to leave the army and start a life with her French lover (Armand Assante) or if she's willing to give him up for her career.

The entire cast is outstanding, but especially Hawn who lights up the screen with her charm and beauty.  We all know where Kate gets it.  This is a great movie about self growth and the ability to become more than what people expect of us.  To her family Judy was always a screw-up, never making the right decisions, always needing to be bailed out of something, but throughout her stay in the army Judy became her own woman and proved to herself that she doesn't need anyone but herself.  A wonderfully delightful slice of entertainment.",1150416000,,2450,4.589449541284404

When Goldie meets her nemesis the tyrannical Captain Lewis who calls Goldie Princess the fun is just beginning.  From the time Goldie cleans the bathroom with her electric toothbrush, to whining her way out of jumping out of an airplane this is definitely one of Goldie's finest moments.

PRIVATE BENJAMIN is the story of a ""Jewish princess"" called Judy Benjamin (Goldie Hawn), whose new husband expires on the honeymoon.  With very little on the horizon, she rashly  decides to enter the army, but comes under the wrath of tyrannical Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan in an Oscar-nominated performance, and later a short-lived television sitcom spin-off).

A classic ""fish out of water"" story, produced by Hawn and largely-tailored to her comedy talents.

An amazing supporting cast too, with Armand Assante, Sam Wanamaker, Mary Kay Place, Albert Brooks, P.J. Soles, Craig T. Nelson, Barbara Barrie, Harry Dean Stanton, Gretchen Wyler and Sally Kirkland.",1147132800,,774,5.363636363636363

2608556,4,B00004CYR8,"Goldie Hawn plays the part of Judy Benjamin, a young socialite who is widowed on her wedding night. Distraught and with no purpose to her life and no skills to speak of she appeals to the listeners of a radio show to help her. One of the respondents is an army recruitment officer who, having convinced Judy that army life really consisted of yachts and condo's and sunbathing in California, manages to get her to sign up for 3 years. This is where the comedy really starts as Judy, who has never had to lift a manicured finger, gets a reality check and discovers that being in the army is not like being on holiday. Goldie Hawn is made for this kind of role, and as usual delivers the goods. There are some genuinely 'laugh out loud' moments as she struggles to adapt and make friends. Unfortunately the film seems to run out of steam half way through. Whereas the first half is true comedy, the second half has very little in the way of humour to offer. Having met a French gynaecologist who she falls for, she wangles a posting to Paris to be with him. This is where the humour disappears as Judy leaves the army to be with him and he turns out to be a control freak that turns Judy into a clone of his ex girlfriend. It's almost like watching two separate films.

Goldie Hawn is as brilliant as ever and really suits the part of kooky blonde. In fact, without her the movie would probably fall flat on its face. All in all this is a movie that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching if only for the hilarity of the first half. Just be prepared for the laughs to disappear.",1128470400,,1592,4.271523178807947

2608558,5,B00004CYR8,"""Private Benjamin"" was one of the best comedies of the 80's as well as one of Goldie Hawn's greatest performances besides ""Cactus Flower"", ""Sugarland Express"", ""Foul Play"", ""Overboard"", and ""The First Wives Club"" all of the titles I just listed have been released in decent DVD editions! Sadly the ""Private Benjamin"" DVD only exsists in this sub-standard Pan and Scan version! Plus the sound and picture quality is very poor! This title is way overdue for a Special Edition. Widescreen with some great special features like perhaps an audio commentary by Ms. Hawn and co-star Eileen Brennan! It would be fun to hear two old friends talk about the fun they had in their Oscar nominated roles. I've noticed that Goldie Hawn has yet to do an audio commentary on any of her films released on DVD. I wonder why? Anyway, I would love to see Warner Bros. give this title the treatment it deserves! I keep checking to see if a Special Edition is on the way but, no! Now I see that WB is releasing a comedy double feature DVD with this title and ""Protocol"" on one disc. Most likely WB will issue the same content on the double feature disc making a remastered Widescreen edition most un-likely! To bad! Such shabby treatment for a wonderful, beloved, box office hit that made alot of money for WB! I'm still hopeful that a better DVD edition will be released one day!

2608559,3,B00004CYR8,"A spoiled Judy Benjamin get's married to an ugly ... guy with an even uglier hairdo (white people can't wear fro's without looking ridiculous). He dies of a heart attack on their honeymoon as they make love on the bathroom floor. A smooth talking Army recruiter hears her sad tale on a radio talk show and offers to help her. After smooth talking her in his office, she signs up. Sounds like a real good story right? Well......
Judy's arrival at Ft Biloxi is funny as are other boot camp scenes... Once Judy decides to tough out basic, it just isn't a comedy anymore. She actually starts to get annoying.
After being given an ultimatum from her CO, (jump or screw) Judy jumps from the airplane. She cries [wolf] and gets an assignment in Paris. It all goes downhill from here. She meets up again with a snobbish Frenchman that she met in Biloxi (yeah I know). Well he's a communist and the Army wants her to stop dating him. She decides to marry him, then changes her mind once she's out of the Army. The final scene is her running happily down the road in a wedding dress acting like a 16 year old.
This movie is a lot like Full Metal Jacket in that after boot camp, everyone shuts it off. Bill Murray's 'Stripes' is a good example of 'interest after the boot camp scenes'. Maybe that's why the old TV show 'Private Benjamin' only dealt with boot camp type training.",1019433600,,1367,4.407114624505929
2608560,3,B00004CYR8,"This 1980s feminist fable is about the pampered and weak JAP (Jewish-American Princess) Judy Benjamin, who wants nothing more than to be married to a rich and successful man and be able to spend lots of money.  She has been cared for by men for her entire life and has no skills, independence, or serious ambitions.  After she is widowed, she falls for a recruiter's sales pitch and joins the Army, believing that it will be like going to a spa and will help her recover from the emotional blow of her husband's death.  There is great comic potential here, but the movie lacks the sort of sharp writing that would have taken it to the next level.  Nonetheless, it obviously strikes a cord with many viewers.
The first half of this film is inoffensive, sitcom-grade material.  (In fact, a sitcom based on the film ran from 1981 to 1983.)  Goldie Hawn's alternately cutesy/whiny act during basic training gets tiring quickly -- she's like a child who keeps begging for our attention -- and the film rarely manages to capitalize on the comic potential of the situations.  Still, it does set up well how her parents' visit to the Army base reminds her of their degrading treatment of her, making her resolve to be the best soldier possible.  We cheer for her to succeed.  She does, of course, becoming a strong and independent woman in the Army.
The second, more serious half of the movie is somewhat more satisfying, as we watch Private Benjamin fight not to let her new French beau Henri bully her into reverting to her shallow, weak, pre-Army self.  Her romance with the despicable Henri is the most interesting part of the film, in part because Arman Assante plays his part so well: charming but condescending and unfaithful.
The picture quality on the DVD is average for a film from 1980.  The DVD includes the trailer and short biographies of the major actors.  The film is captioned in several languages and can be heard with French dubbing.  It does not include a widescreen version, just pan-and-scan.",1011484800,,2006,4.6971428571428575
2608561,5,B00004CYR8,"Judy is in an extremely vulnerable state and when she calls into a radio show to understand why her life is in turmoil, an army recruter asks to meet her. When she arrives, she is obviously confused and wants to escape from her problems.

An assignment in Europe, getting into peak physical shape and living in her own condo sounds just too tempting. The reality of the situation is not so tempting. $458 a month hardly makes up for your husband dying on your wedding night. When she arrives at boot camp and says: ""Is green the only color these come in? Where are the yahts?"" You just fall in love with her character.

The disturbingly insensitive Captain Doreen Lewis is a comic treat all by herself, yet even with a whip in hand, not even she can compete with the pouting princess. Doreen wants to toss Judy right back into the arms of her parents. However, when Judy's father tells her she is not intelligent enough to make her own decisions, something changes. Private Benjamin decides to stay.

Some of the great comic moments are when Goldie is cleaning the bathroom with her electric toothbrush. I have stayed at an army base in Germany and trust me, they could have used a bit of toothbrush cleaning. My thoughts were that in the army, everything was spotless. Not! So, this movie was even funnier since I could totally relate to some of the experiences Judy had to go through. Another reason to respect our men and women in the military!

While this is mostly a comedy, there is some romance, with a sadistic twist. You know there is going to be trouble when Judy asks: ""Am I making sense?"" And her French Fianc' says: ""No, and that `s what I love about you."" You start to get the feeling that Judy is the only one who really knows what she wants and that no one else is listening.

Judy starts off running from her problems and ends up running from her problems. There are no real solutions presented, except to run. And maybe sometimes if you think about it, running is just a good idea.

Comic Entertainment at its finest!

2608562,3,B00004CYR8,"Along with ""Foul Play"" this is one of Goldie Hawn's finest hours, playing a rich, pampered widow who is duped into joining the army.  An hysterical comedy who's format has been returned to time and again, but never quite to this effect.  Eileen Brennan is equally fantastic as the tough army officer you love to hate.  I've been awaiting the release of this film on DVD for some time (along with Foul Play which hasn't yet been released), and it's here that I felt disappointed.  For one, the only released version of this is in Standard Pan & Scan.  I know some of you out there still cling to this outmoded format, but for the rest of us, this is unacceptable.  At the very least, it should have been dual sided, with Widescreen on one side and Standard on the other.  Secondly, they've done nothing with soundtrack other than present in Dolby Stereo 2.0.  I realize that with some older titles, they don't bother to remaster the soundtrack in 5.0 (let alone DTS - the Ultimate sound format for your buck!), but I still think it's very lame that they do this.  Anyway, there is a trailer, at least, but don't expect any deleted scenes, bloopers, or any other fancy features.  The film can also be heard in French, but Spanish would also have been nice (there are at least Spanish subtitles).  They've priced this relatively low (I guess because they knew what a lame job they did with it), but I'd have preferred a bit more of a higher price if it meant little more effort on their part for this truly classic comedy.  Let's hope that ""Foul Play"" offers a lot more when it's finally released.",990748800,,1594,4.496527777777778
2608563,2,B00004CYR8,"Did anyone but me notice that this movie stops being a comedy the moment Judy Benjamin defies her parents and decides to remain in the army?  From the very next scene through the conclusion, it becomes a deliberate feminist polemic and deliberately unfunny.  Feminism is nice, but filmmakers seem either afraid to have too much fun with it or unable to keep from aiming over the top.  (See Nine to Five and The Incredible Shrinking Woman for two other examples.)  Eileen Brennan's scene in which she first meets Benjamin is the high point and (unfortunately and needless to say) comes early.  As with Swing Shift, Hawn flexed her star muscles and did things her way -- to the detriment of the product and the audience.",978566400,,718,4.712

8131612,5,B00004CYR8,"I watched this last night - it's well worth revisiting - it's a very funny film. Goldie Hawn carries humour effortlessly with a wonderful supporting cast. But beyond the indisputable humour there is warmth (you genuinely care about Benjamin) and a serious message. It might not be Thelma and Louise, but it's up there with it.

Watching the film last night was interesting considering the Weinstein scandal at the moment, the number of increased reports concerning sexual abuse and women's position in society in general. The film is good at showing a woman blind to her own capabilities, caught in a world where the men around her might think they love her, but really don't pay any attention to her - but nor does Benjamin herself! She is trapped in a role which society relentlessly imposes on her.

Watch as her father lovingly gives her an astounding wedding present, but then totally ignores her as he watches the game on the TV, asking her to pass him cigarettes, matches - this on her wedding day. Then her husband in the car, just after the wedding, as he asks Benjamin to perform a certain sexual duty. It's hilarious, but also shocking in the one-sided demand and lack of real love. Then the husband makes a similar request at home - this time he gets his 'come uppance'.

Will the third husband be any better?

The humour always has first place in this film (I think?). Goldie Hawn as a natural comedian, knows how to make fun of herself and there are wonderful moments. The film has a lot to compare with Legally Blonde and Reese Witherspoon excellently handles that role. Where Private Benjamin veers off, is that it is more grounded. Legally Blonde goes all the way with the Kitsch. In PB, there is an observation that society thinks Benjamin loses it when she joins the army. The reality is she is totally lost when home-chained. She even loses her sense of taste, I don't want to give too much away.

One of the phrases casually thrown out about the the last generation and sexual inequality is, 'things were different then' as though there was no awareness of women's rights in the eighties, all men were bullies and men had no sexual manners. It's false to think of men as a single group: some men are decent some are not - same for women. I'm not so sure how things were so different. Of course there was awareness, there was a huge wave of political awareness mid-sixties onwards on all sorts of angles, the bomb, race matters, sexual equality, over population  - in some ways things have gone backwards. Look at current commercials where women, 'free of men', are slaves to products, the female image is shallow.

This film covers those issues - the awareness was clearly there -  it makes you wonder . . . how long does change take?

The one star reviews here say the film is dated, the polemic takes over the humour, the men are portrayed in a shallow way. I don't think so, this is comedy, some slack has to be given. It came out with an ""R"" rating - it's not pretending to be inoffensive. True, it could do with some consistently positive male roles, but as a film observing a trapped woman discovering what she wants to do with her life, it's a good film. Don't watch this film if you wish to identify with a male role model.",1524441600,,3252,4.535836177474403
