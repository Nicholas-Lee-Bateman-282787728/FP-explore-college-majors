Here's what I know about artist Vincent Van Gogh (1853 to 1890): (1) He only sold one painting in his lifetime (ironic since one of his paintings in modern times sold for 40 million dollars) (2) he sliced off part of his ear in a fit of madness.

This documentary reveals that there was much, much more to this man.  I say documentary but this is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill documentary that was written and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Paul Cox.

Beware!  This is not a biography of Van Gogh but a look into his psyche during the last eighteen years of his life.

This documentary consists of British actor John Hurt reading from selected letters Van Gough wrote mostly to his younger brother (named Theodore or ""Theo"").  These letters date from 1872 to 1890.  Cox has thus found an effective and unique way to tell Van Gogh's story even though it's somewhat repetitive to listen to Hurt's voice for an hour and a half.  (I must admit though, Hurt's voice is interesting and distinctive.)

I learned what an incredibly gifted writer Van Gogh was.  These letters reveal his passion, idealism, and frustration.  Here is a sentence from one of his letters that I feel accurately and succinctly sums up his life:

""It is basically true that a painter is a man who is too absorbed in what his eyes see and is not sufficiently master of the rest of his life.""

On screen, we see a collection of imagery (sometimes random) that relates (sometimes vaguely) to the themes in the letters, interspersed with a few drawings and paintings of Van Gogh's famous works.  Occasionally music accompanies the images, some of it classical.

Overall, this documentary helps the viewer better understand not only Van Gogh's ""life and death"" but also his passion for painting.

The DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras, the most important, in my opinion, being a brief written biography of Van Gogh.  For Paul Cox fans there is also a 55-minute featurette entitled ""A Journey with Paul Cox.""

Finally, here is a sentence from the above written biography that sums up Van Gough's greatness as an artist:

""Vincent Van Gogh's direct brushstrokes, radiant colors, and passionate approach to his subjects made him one of the greatest artists of the last hundred years.""

In conclusion, this is an unusual and unusually absorbing work with an original vision.  What you would expect when learning about a most original artist!!

The story of Vincent van Gogh's life seems best told in his own words, complete with casual sketches, detailed drawings and famous paintings. In the spirit of ""Crows"" in Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (where we see the Langlois Bridge and Crows in the Wheatfields brought to life), we are entertained by visions of painting after painting. It is fun to watch Akira Kurosawa's Dreams after viewing this movie because then you recognize the paintings that were brought to life in a dream of pure visual delight.

The Caf Terrace, Yellow House, Fishing Boats, Bedroom at Arles, Starry Night and Sunflowers are some of the paintings featured, but there is an entire world of Vincent van Gogh's art that is introduced with analytical letters written to his brother. In these letters he tells his brother of the art he is working on and his motivating influences all while we the viewer are entertained with the art, scenes from nature and the acting out of various scenes (Night Caf with Pool Table) that eventually became paintings. There are fields of olive trees from Olive Trees 1889 and Vincent's letter speaks of the difficulty of capturing the colors in the soil and tree bark.

When you hear the story of Vincent van Gogh's life in his own words, suddenly he becomes so much more than a famous artist. His life is filled with tragedy and hardship, but he is also able to find stunning beauty through his love of philosophy and his view of the world seems to remain relatively positive right up until his death. He not only travels, he also lives with Gauguin. The art shown after living with Gauguin shows how being able to relate to someone like himself increased his creativity.

He speaks of how he is a self-taught artist and how thankful he is that he was not trained and therefore had to experiment with paint to produce eye-catching effects. As he travels, his world expands and so does his art. He tries to capture his experience in 1,800 works during his life and while they can't all be shown in this movie, the director tries to capture as many beautiful scenes and pieces of art as he can in as many ways film allows. The creativity is delightful as actors take their places and then a picture emerges.

""How lovely yellow is."" ~Vincent van Gogh

He seems far from debilitating madness in his letters (he talks about episodes) and more inclined towards deep contemplations and philosophical discussions. He seems to be reaching out to a world that does not quite understand him all while trying to make the lives of those around him less lonely.

The movie begins with his lofty spiritual goals and ends with his death. We learn so much about this artist, of his being homesick for the land of pictures and how he felt compelled to capture the daily activities of the peasants.

The goodness in his heart truly shines through the darkness of his later days as he helps a woman most would have shunned and must live without the love of the woman he wanted to marry.

Through a weaving of philosophy and art, Paul Cox created a stunning and somewhat mesmerizing journey through the life of Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). I watched both the movie and the interview three times because the thoughts and experiences are so compelling. Of all the movies I've seen on an artist's life, this is my favorite. What makes this truly memorable are the letters from Vincent to Theo read eloquently by John Hurt.

After watching this, you may find yourself looking for a book about Vincent van Gogh's art or his letters in order to find some of the art shown in this movie or to expand your knowledge of his writing and philosophy. While many emphasize the madness, this movie emphasizes the struggle for beauty and the unending desire of the artist to capture all that he loves.

2319326,5,B0009U6XD4,"I can only imagine how pleased Van Gogh would be at seeing his work articulated through Paul Cox's lens.  Interspersed with countless images of Van Gogh's original work, are cinematic images of the landscapes, the still-lifes, the town, and the people that Van Gogh knew so well.  Cox unassumingly uses real people and costumes in an almost dream-like fashion; they exist along the edges of the film, in a sort of blur; as if we were living directly in Van Gogh's dreams and memories.  What's most astounding though, is that I never knew what an incredibly gifted writer Van Gogh was.  The entire film is narration of Van Gogh's words, in letters written to his brother.  His passion, idealism, and frustration are articulated in ways that are so tangible ... it makes all other works about frustrated idealists seem downright silly.  It took me a while to warm up to John Hurt's narration because I kept envisioning him instead of Van Gogh, but after a little while I got lost in the words just and concentrated on the feeling that Hurt was evoking.  By the end I was in tears.  It's the best film about an artist that I've ever seen. - - - Also, don't forget to check out the fantastic 55 minute documentary on the film's director, Paul Cox; a soul mate of Van Gogh's to be sure.",1127779200,19,1281,4.539130434782609
2319327,1,B0009U6XD4,"I will not tell people to buy that DVD of the life and death of vincent Van Gogh, very dispointed with that DVD, it dosn't give much information about his death, so don't buy this DVD, buy a different Van Gogh DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1298332800,,238,4.558139534883721
2319328,5,B0009U6XD4,"I love the sensitivity with which this film was made. All the words are Vincent's own, and the selection of passages is brilliant. As is the cinematography, which synthesizes the scenes he was exposed to and the paintings he made of those scenes, as well as the emotion and color which his words articulate so movingly. I especially appreciate that the editor selected many of the passages in which Vincent describes, with both nuance and intensity, the colors he is seeing and what they signify to him; I have never heard any other human in any field speak so movingly and poignantly about color. I've read Vincent's letters and seen other films about him, but this made me feel far closer to him than I ever have before. My only regret was that the print of the film I watched seems faded; mine was a Netflix rental but I suspect that the quality of the original is degraded somewhat.",1296432000,3,886,4.578616352201258
2319329,5,B0009U6XD4,This documentary faithfully guides you to live through Vincent van Gogh's tragic and artistic life in his own words. A must-watch for any van Gogh fans.,1245456000,2,152,4.884615384615385
2319330,4,B0009U6XD4,"I saw this film in the theatre in the late 1980's and have shown this film to my students for many years.  This is quite simply the best film on an artist ever made.  There is nothing condescending or easy in this movie.  The film is approached with the same serious spirit that Van Gogh possessed.  We hear Vincent's alternatingly inspirational and heartbreaking words read with deep understanding by John Hurt.  Hurt does not think about these words, he inhabits them.  I cannot concieve of a better choice for the narration of these letters.

The cinematography is intense, personal, agitated, calm, and experimental.  It is perfectly suited to the material.  This is not a polished, Ken Burns-style documentary.  The approach is subjective and risky...but it works.  This is smart, touching, belly food.

So why only 4 stars?  Now we get to my motivation for writing in the first place.  This DVD is an abysmal transfer of the original film.  The colors are washed out and bland, the contrast is low.  Someone should be arrested for allowing this to happen.  Paul Cox, anyone, please ""re-master"" this film with an original print.  Van Gogh's paintings do not come through in this DVD.  Very sorry indeed.  A major flaw.",1239148800,10,1223,4.844660194174757
2319331,3,B0009U6XD4,"I watched the DVD but it did not hold my interest as much as I thought it would.  The writings of Vincent were read throughout and that was fascinating but the cinematography seemed to be fragmented and although it attempted to show the countryside where Vincent lived and how this inspired him (colors, form, locals), the cut to his paintings was quick and didn't give me enough opportunity to contemplate the beauty of his pieces.  I still would recommend this DVD if you just want a look inside of Vincent's mind as he unravels to a tragic end.",1210550400,4,547,4.571428571428571
2319332,1,B0009U6XD4,"I am an Art History teacher and an avid admirer of Vincent Van Gogh.

This pseudo-documentary is visually uninteresting and seems more home-made than professional.  The actor reading the Van Gogh letters has an irritating voice and a monotonal delivery.  The score is un-musical and aimless.  I am sorry, but I do not recommend this video to anyone for any reason.",1197763200,5,364,4.918032786885246
2319333,5,B0009U6XD4,"Documentarian Cox's deceptively simple approach to penetrating the enigma of Vincent Van Gogh scores a direct hit. British actor Hurt's weathered but still rich voice expertly conveys the artist's building anguish without our needing facial expressions to pay it off. And Cox's wildly imaginative mix of imagery which accompanies Hurt's recitations help elevate this piece well above the standard run of PBS-type documentary work. ""Vincent"" is an absolute must for all us art-lovers.",1184025600,3,483,5.63013698630137
2319334,2,B0009U6XD4,"I bought this DVD after reading all the 5 star reviews, and I must admit, I was very disappointed.  I am an avid reader of books and watcher of movies about Van Gogh, so it wasn't the fact that this movie told nothing about Van Gogh that bothered me, but the sheer dryness and feel of the film as a whole.  The only real information the movie reveals about Van Gogh is a short text paragraph at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the film is just John Hurt reading Van Gogh's letters to his brother while the screen shows flashes of some of Van Gogh's paintings, as well as random shots of landscapes.  While this works for a little while, after a few minutes it becomes tedious and boring.  I didn't even make it all the way through the movie-only about 45 minutes.  I wish I could give this a better review, and some people may say my view is too simple, but that's how I see it.  If you're looking for facts about Van Gogh presented in an entertaining manner, I don't recommend this DVD.",1170288000,11,1004,4.230366492146596
2319335,5,B0009U6XD4,"As a painter and student of art history, I see a LOT of movies and read a lot of books about art and artists. This film is a triumph. It is visually stunning - you could turn off the sound and enjoy the images alone. John Hurt is the perfect voice -- his voiceover is made up entirely of selected portions of Van Gogh's letters. (Complete, unabridged archives of the letters are available on-line, just do a search.)

This is one of the best films about an artist ever made. Don't miss it.",1168387200,4,489,4.258064516129032
2319336,5,B0009U6XD4,"Vincent Van Gogh is wildly popular today in ways he could have never imagined:  his work is on post cards, in massive coffee table books, and on T-shirts, and he's even venerated in a pop song by Don MClean.  Thankfully, this film by Paul Cox presents a more realistic view of Van Gogh, reminding us of the artist's anguish and the very great difficulty he had coming to terms with his sadness and inadequacies.  Cox shows Van Gogh's need to give shape to his suffering through art.  Van Gogh's life is rendered through his own words, from his letters, read by John Hurt, and through still imagery of the artist's sketches and paintings.  These still images are interspersed with gorgeous nature shots, interiors, and the occasional effective recreation of spaces that inhabit Van Gogh's paintings.  A really big bonus to this DVD is the interview with Paul Cox, in which you see how Cox's life somewhat parallels Van Gogh's in terms of childhood unhappiness, loneliness, and the need to express himself through imagery.  This interview will appeal especially to artists because it is so inspiring.

Cox reminds the viewer what art IS and why it is created and explains to us why there is so much mediocrity in film.  Indeed, Cox's views on the need to rise above mediocrity are very similar to Van Gogh's.",1157673600,7,1306,4.768888888888889
8066553,5,B0009U6XD4,"This is the best film I've ever seen on Van Gogh, whether documentary or drama. Hurt's reading of Vincent's letters to Theo is absolutely brilliant and perfectly complements the video retracing the artists steps. Beautiful and heartbreaking.",1512086400,,241,5.54054054054054

8066557,5,B0009U6XD4,"Van Gogh is a fascinating artist  both in his life and his art.  I saw this years ago in Newport Beach with my wife and we were quite taken with the presentation.  My wife is an art teacher (now retired) and found it fascinating.  I'm a History teacher (now retired as well).  It made for a fascinating blend of his life and his art.  We bought a VHS tape after seeing the movie.  When the DVD emerged years later a jumped at the chance to have it.  John Hurt's narration was excellent and propels the film beautifully.  I would heartily recommend this to anyone interested in Van Gogh, art studies or anything in that realm.",1388620800,3,625,4.3652173913043475
8066558,5,B0009U6XD4,"I am a big fan of the work of Paul Cox?
Vincent special. The idea of making a film just based on letters is very special and works very well in this film.
Paul cox did it with Nijinsky based on his diaries. Although I like the film as well,it has not the same flow about it as Vincent has",1382313600,,288,3.816666666666667
8066559,1,B0009U6XD4,This movie was a big disappointment - It could have taken only ten minutes to show the art - the rest was just a poorly filmed train or scene going by. The book was great - I thought the movie was going to be similar - not even close.,1379462400,,234,3.795918367346939
8066560,5,B0009U6XD4,"This documentary is not easy to follow or watch in a single sitting. It requires several viewings to appreciate. The monolog of the documentary is taken from Van Gogh's own writings over his life. I note that they do not presume that Van Gogh committed suicide, only a gunshot is heard and he likely was murdered. The paintings and drawings, I believe over 2500 in Van Gogh's artistic career, are represented in this piece. The narration is by the English actor John Hurt. It is deeply entertaining stuff.",1340150400,,505,4.75
8066561,5,B0009U6XD4,"This film is composed of Vincents letters, mostly to his brother Theo. If you ever wanted to know about Van Gogh's personal life, this is the film to watch. Beautifully constructed. Van Gogh's words are as heartfelt as his paintings. I now own this masterpiece and have watched it more times than I can count. But I am reviewing it as a person and an artist that wanted to know more about Vincent's life rather than just his paintings. The best film about Vincent Van Gogh that I have ever seen and I have seen many if not all of them. Simply put, its just the letters written by two brothers that loved each other. 5 stars without a doubt.",1328313600,,640,4.341666666666667
