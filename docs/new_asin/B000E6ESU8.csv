2501107,4,B000E6ESU8,"Writer Jacqueline Perske  and Director Rowan Woods chalk up another successful Australian film in LITTLE FISH, an intense, very personal drama about how illegal drugs affect communities, families and individuals.  The story begs patience from the viewer as it is gratefully one that does not spell everything out for the viewer, but instead introduces the characters slowly and with hints of backgrounds that bring them to the moments of crisis the timeframe of the film uses.

Taking place in the Little Saigon area of Sydney, Tracy Heart (Cate Blanchett) is a recovered junkie who lives with her mother Janelle (Noni Hazlehurst) and partial amputee brother Ray (Martin Henderson), each trying to make ends meet in a life previously destroyed by drug addiction.  Tracy has been clean for four years, works in a video store but has dreams of owning her own business, dreams that are thwarted by banks refusing to give her business loans solely on the basis of her previous addiction.  Ray, his amputated leg the result of a car accident somehow connected with drugs, still sells heroin in 'little fish' containers, occasionally calling upon Tracy to make pickups and deliveries.  The now absent stepfather Lionel (Hugo Weaving) fights his own addiction both to drugs and to his dealer Brad (Sam Neill) with whom he has been in a gay relationship since his divorce from Janelle.  Tracy tries to support Lionel's attempts to kick his habit, but the attempts are failures.  Everything comes to a head when 1) Tracy is desperate without her needed bank loan, 2) Tracy's Vietnamese ex-lover Jonny (Dustin Nguyen) returns from Vancouver where his family sent him to avoid the persecution of rehab in Sydney, 3) Brad retires leaving Lionel without a source of drugs or love and Lionel is replaced by a quasi-normal Steven (Joel Tobeck) who kicks the last part of the film into a spin.  There are no solutions to anyone's problems: things just happen and the characters respond in the best way they can with the ominous cloud of drug addiction shading their lives and futures.

The script is terse and smart and the direction is relentlessly realistic and well paced.  Cate Blanchett gives a sterling portrayal of the very complex Tracy, and Hugo Weaving, Noni Hazelhurst, Sam Neill, Dustin Nguyen, and Martin Henderson are superb.  This is a tough little film that does not fear to examine the truth about the effect of drugs on people's lives and spirits. It is a very fine film. Recommended.

2501375,4,B000E6ESU8,"This is a tough little Australian film that stays with you long after it is over. Cate Blanchett is, as expected, excellent. Hugo Weaving is a fine actor, and has certainly appeared in his share of blockbuster hits (The Matrix trilogy, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy), but it is in his Australian films (Proof, The Adventures Of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, The Last Ride, etc.) that he really gets to shine, and in Little Fish he gives one of his best performances. The story doesn't sensationalize drug use or provide a stereotyped look at kicking the habit with florid scenes of characters going cold turkey. Instead it focuses in on a woman who has already kicked the habit, but still has to live with the consequences of having been a user in the past. This is what gives the film its humanity.",1360281600,5,800,4.5625
2501376,4,B000E6ESU8,"I watched this movie and honestly I didn't like it, it was kind of boring.  I felt like it lacked structure or a different ending, it gives you the impression that is just a narration without a conclusion.  Or maybe it was meant to be like that, maybe it's just a mirror of how the lives of the people who has been in drugs is, extremely difficult.  It raises the question how do the people that have had a history in drugs live their lives, how do they live a life fill with nothing? How do they live an empty life?  This film states the importance that if you want to recover from drugs, you will have to change your friends, you cannot expect to stay out of drugs, if you keep hanging out with your same ""all drug friends"", but maybe the problem here is that the ""all friends who consumed drugs"" were family.....very close family.  It was also very interesting to me to realize that as a parent, you actually never finish parenting your children, you'll have to parent them in a different way, but you will have to be there for them forever!

What it's absolutely superb is the performance of Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving.  They deliver a terrific performance!  They are indeed the best of the film.",1300665600,2,1205,4.396396396396397
2501377,4,B000E6ESU8,"I had withdrawal symptoms, hadn't watched a Cate Blanchett movie in years. Must be because she has a real job now, at a Sydney theatre, rather than making flimsy movies for more money than she can possibly earn now.

This woman is one of the best. Here she gives us a credible 32 y old depressed struggling woman in Sydney. She is a manager in a video shop and wants to become a partner by injecting money for an expansion of the business. She can't get a loan due to her credit reports.
She has a younger brother who is a drug dealer. She has a former boyfriend who is a drug dealer. Her father, not in the picture, possibly dead, was a junkey. There is an ex-stepfather (Hugo Weaving), or rather she is friends with her mother's ex-boyfriend, who is a junkey and a former rugby star and a sometimes lover of the local big man in the drugs distribution (Sam Neil). This 'old man' (must be 50 at least, imagine that) is badly losing it, he can't afford his habit any more, but he can't stand the rehab. The only thing that he can do is reminisce about good old times on the beach with his shiny shiny girl, and look forward into the abyss.
You get the picture. We get a slow, convincing, impressive snapshot at a depressing life style. Big fish and little fish normally swim in different parts of the water. Sometimes their paths cross and that can't be good for the little ones.",1300233600,2,1379,4.324324324324325
2501378,2,B000E6ESU8,"Like one of the previous reviewers I purchased this movie on the reputations of Cate Blanchett & Sam Neill.  Should have read the description of the movie on the back of the box more closely.
I generally watch a movie for the escape from reality factor.  This one too closely mirrors the reality I see and read about in western society everyday.
If I want to see drug addicted losers with no morals all I have to do is view the world that surrounds me on any given day.
So I give the movie two stars not for the acting, but for the content.
I don't find a story line that features druggies and the drama that surrounds their lives particularly intriguing or entertaining.",1262304000,2,671,4.403225806451613
2501379,1,B000E6ESU8,"I picked this movie up because I really enjoy Cate Blanchett and I hadn't even heard of this one, but I really just didn't like it.  I would never buy this movie nor watch it again.  The DVD case said ""Psychological Thriller"", ""Your hairs will be standing up on end"", ""Weaving looks a lot scarier than he ever did as Mr. Smith in the 'Matrix' films""....needless, to say I was expecting to be watching an exciting, edge-of-your-seat-suspense film, but what I got was a slow, plodding, expose' in the screwed up, tragic lives of drug addicts and the people around them.  It was extremely depressing given the fact that the end of the movie leaves viewers with nothing to feel good about.  These characters don't seem to ever change or truly move past their addictive, manipulative behavior...and maybe that's the point, I don't know.  I did think the acting by all the cast was good...they really seemed to be the people they were portraying...and I still love Cate, but I thought the movie was really dreary with very little suspense unless you count the anxiety of whether they'll get through whatever hare-brained scheme they've come up with to get what they want (ie drugs or money) for the day.",1243728000,6,1197,4.708133971291866

I am an Australian who lives in America and i really wish that more movies here tackled issues no matter how distasteful or life affirming in this manner.
There are fine movies made here to be sure,but so many swap realism for a cutout or so called sexier version of it.
The performances by Blanchett and the rest of the cast are great.
Nothing is overused or watered down in the many scenes that while on the surface appearing mundane are loaded with venom or longing like the drug the movie is centered around.
The spareness of scenes like tracy back at the train station scoring then stumbling past the children's choir singing an anthen like version of Cold Chisel's Flame trees is so full of longing that i could almost feel myself thinking of situations and times in my own life.
If you like reality that hurts like life does at times watch this and it will remind you that movies that confront reality make understanding yourself that little bit easier.

2501381,4,B000E6ESU8,"Unusual look at reformed druggies and how their lives can be forever tied to addiction. The characters and plot are unusual. As the cover blurb notes, everyone is hiding something in this movie. That's its appeal. Intelligent script and great casting make this one a winner.",1226793600,3,274,4.978260869565218
2501382,3,B000E6ESU8,"Everyone else, however, will find it hard going.  Film school students will admire the unrelenting portrayal of dreary lives, the eliptical script, the A listed high powered cast giving meticulous well thought out performances.  Film critics, many of them film school graduates, have already pronounced it worthy, worthy, worthy. I found it boring, boring, boring.

Why do filmmakers often seem to forget that they are storytellers?  It is a storyteller's obligation to entertain or at least involve the audience.  Unrelenting portrayals of dreary lives are just that...dreary.  And because the script is so eliptical (very arty though)it is difficult to get a grip on the emotional stakes for the characters in what is going on.

Watching this movie was like eating a trout filet with too many small bones, enjoyment is spoiled by having to pick pieces of story out of a script that gives one too little to chew on amid too many annoying and pointless distractions.

Despite that, Hugo Weaving does manage to engage some sympathy.  He is a fine actor.  I wish the script had served him as well as he served it.  Cate Blanchett was wasted in a totally thankless role.  The actress playing her mother, I would like to see more of.  For their sakes, I gave this movie three stars.",1193788800,,1278,4.861111111111111
2501383,5,B000E6ESU8,"I totally disagree with the reviewer who said this is a waste of time.

I bought this as a previewed dvd from Blockbuster as I love Cate so much. During the first 5-10 minutes of the film I was a little confused as to who the characters were and what the relationships were between them. But I think that makes for an interesting film...not the same old predictable movies that Hollywood seems to be making these days...soon enough you start to piece together how these characters are related to one another.

Cate and Hugo both give outstanding performances and the whole cast is excellent.  I also like the fact that it is an Australian film and the film takes you to a place you might not otherwise have experienced.

I was so interested to learn more about the background of this film that I listened to the director's commentary got a great insight into the plot and the acting.

Cate continues to impress me as one of the best actresses around and this is not a waste of time in my opinion. It's a haunting and poignant film and I just cannot get it out of my head...it stays with you long after you've seen it.",1177977600,8,1117,4.402912621359223

Aussie accent and difficult to understand and the characters mumbled. Save your money and purchase one of Cate Blanchetts other great movies of which there are many.",1174953600,5,438,4.688311688311688
2501395,5,B000E6ESU8,"Since many have recounted the plot, I will just start in with the film as a whole.  The pacing of the story works perfectly to build great suspense.  The music as well fits in beautifully, especially the Karaoke in the scenes in Little Saigon.

All the actors are first rate.  Kate Blanchette and Hugo Weaving both won awards for their intense portrayals of Tracy Heart and her step-father, Lionel, an ex champion athlete.

The actors who play brother Ray, her mother, Janelle, her ex-boyfriend, Jonny all excel at bringing the characters to life in a completely believable manner.

Finally San Neill as the real stone-cold killer, Bradley Thompson, is scary and convincing.  Of course Australian and European directors make suspense and crime films which differ from the Hollywood versions but often the films from other countries are far superior as this one is to most Hollywood suspense films since after the wonderful film noir masterpieces.",1171670400,6,946,5.064516129032258
2501396,3,B000E6ESU8,"Little fish is about a woman trying to escape her past and get on with her life. Tracey, a former heroin addict, finds it hard to break her shackles and find her independance that she so desperately wants. Being in her 30's, still living with her mum and brother dealing with the return of her ex-boyfriend after a 4 year abscense and trying to help her drug addicted step father kick his habit, only add to all the frustrations Tracey (played by Blanchett) feel in her life. With little glimmer of hope, the banks keep refusing to loan her money to kick start her own business and a second chance for a new life, you can see Tracey become more and more frustrated and angry as the story progresses. Director Rowan Woods develops a background of all the characters brilliantly, but doesn't really take the script anywhere. Best known for his work on the play, ""the boys"", Woods doesn't seem able to take the script by Jacquelin Perske anywhere, it just kind of sits dormant.

The script centre's around the lead character, plated brilliantly by Cate Blanchett, it is worth seeing the movie for her performance alone. With an ensemble cast including Hugo Weaving, Sam Neill, Martin Henderson, Lisa McCune, Noni Hazlehurst and Susie Porter, it is a who's who of Australian cinema. The chemistry between Blanchett and Henderson, as her brother is outstanding and it is these two characters that carry the film. Henderson's charcter Ray is fighting demons of his own, having lost his leg in car accident caused by Jonny, Tracey's ex boyfriend, who's return opens old wounds that seem to affect every character, especially Tracey and Ray's mum, played by Noni Hazlehurst.

Set in and around Cabramatta, a violent and drug riddled suburb of south-western Sydney, this is a tense, often depressing drama, that is slow at times, but moving and powerful. Probably about 20 minutes too long, the ending is slightly disappointing and leaves too many issues unresolved and up in the air. There seems little closure for the charcters involved and you are left wondering if there was a happy ending or a tragic one.

The music and cinematography is good, the acting is excellent, but overall I couldn't help but be a little disappointed after watching it. Certainly not as good as woods previous effort, 'the boys'.",1163462400,8,2301,4.83502538071066
2501397,1,B000E6ESU8,"Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Sam Neil are great actors. Unfortunately their combined talents weren't able to rescue this slow moving, pointless and boring movie, or at least that's how I'd describe the first 20 minutes. I gave up watching it at that point. Maybe the movie magically turns into this critically acclaimed wunderfest after that.",1159142400,5,346,5.196428571428571
2501398,4,B000E6ESU8,"This is one of the few Cate's Aussie production since she shot to fame after the reign of Elizabeth. The production has a solid cast with Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Martin Henderson together with a great local cast including Noni Hazzlehurst, Sam Neil and Susie Potter.

The story set in the Vietnamese area of Cabramatta in western Sydney, an area most well know about the gangsters and unique Vietnamese culture. Cate plays a heroin addict turned video shop manager who tried to go up the rank by partnering with her boss to extend the shop's business. However, it is because of her will to live a new life that brought back the pass to haunt her even more. Her family is dysfunctional, largely due to the introduction of heroine into the family by the veteran addict and ex rugby league star (come on it's Australian, so rugby league is an obvious choice) played by Hugo Weaving. Because of him, Cate was addicted and needed to go through a tedious home cleansing procedure to rid of her addiction, and her mother was her key to suuccess. Because of Hugo, Cate's brother played by Martin Henderson lost his feet in a car crash because he was high with his friend and Cate's ex-boyfriend Justin Ngyun (of 21 Jump Steet). There is no doubt that Hugo loves Cate and Noni, but Noni could never forgive Hugo's doing in the past. To make it more complicated, Hugo was involved in a same sex relationship with his ex-manager played by Sam Neil. The relationships among this bunch of people just tangled on in the movie.

Little Fish literally means the fish shaped soya sauce containers used for hold drugs in the movie. However, the plot was far from simple. The whole production is very heavy and reminds you about movies like 21 Grams and Requiem of a Dream, but with a strong Australian touch. The setting in Cabramatta actually gave the movie a strong sense of presence and made the characters more believable. However, the pace of the movie, as with most Australian movies were very dragging at certain parts and the lack of strong motives for certain characters actually undermined the movie alot.

Performance-wise, Cate's did a great job but there were no surprises because it's now expected for her to do a good job. But she did shed all her glamour and put on a good show for the movie. In fact as the character that tied every other characters in the movie together, she is great and provided the necessary beats for the movie. Hugo Weaving and Noni Hazzlehurst are easily the two other cast members who outshines everyone in the movie. This is mostly due to they got some of the best roles. Hugo is very believable in his performance although sometimes you couldn't figure out why he is an ex-rugby star for his built. Noni Hazzlehurst is great and all the scenes between her and Cate are the reasons for you to hang on to the movie because you do care about the development of their mother-daughter relationship. Martin Henderson and Justin Ngyun didn't really shine mostly because of the lack of depth in their character. Martin put down his pretty face for more serious role but he role itself doesn't have enough weight to initiate a transformation for him. Justin's character was just mediocre.

Without a doubt, Little Fish is one of the better recent Australian productions in the recent years. However, as a production, it still suffers the problem of most Australian movies nowadays - a solid and attention gripping way of story telling, and the indulgence of over the top serious dramatic lines. Without a doubt, with limited budgets for all Australian movies nowadays, there are lots of things that can't be done as their Hollywood counterparts, however, a tight plot with substance is what we need. Crash and Brokeback Mountain didn't really have astronomical budgets but they managed to hit through the heart of the audience because of the story telling, and that's what modern Australian movies need to work hard on. Nonetheless, the saving grace is the movie got a great cast that managed to bring the experience through to the audience. Another recent production Jindabyne is less lucky in all departments. So if you enjoy Australian movie and love Cate, this is a movie that you can watch. You won't be too disappointed but at the same time you won't be excited either. It could be a good Saturday night stay home movie.",1155600000,8,4349,4.725955204216074
2501399,5,B000E6ESU8,"Brilliant and disturbingly honest

Cate Blanchett gives a sterling performance as Tracy Heart, a young woman struggling to reinvent herself beyond her drug-related, criminal past by managing a local video store.

But Heart is tied to, and trapped in her past, partly by circumstance (her heroin addicted father and alcoholic mother) and partly by a series of her own bad choices. Her inner and outer struggles; the battle between doing what is best for her versus what she wants (ex boyfriend Johnny) which put her constantly in a state of limbo, swimming to nowhere. Her desire for a future combined with her inability to get a bank loan to get started; wanting more, wanting better, to do better and have better, yet her inherently tragic, drug-laden environment continues to ensnarl her despite her best efforts to stay clean. The constant self-sabotage even as she helps others - and not knowing how to help herself--make her the beautifully complex, tragic character we can all identify with.

The fractured life of Tracy Heart is echoed beautifully in the smashing of the photographs of children, the breaking glass, the breaking vase, the constant breaking  - everything is breaking down around her, and her sad, broken and dysfunctional life leads her back to the only place where she can find peace and serenity; the swimming pool. The swimming serves as another poetically sharp contrast to the madness of her drug-infected life, swimming back and forth, back forth, going nowhere.

Blanchett is outstanding, and her ability to capture the inner complexities of Tracy Heart is a truly memorable performance right to the end - and then she returns to her childhood beach, and to happier, less complicated days, where we see her bring her father to rest, with a fly on his face.
Come to think of it, we are all little fish, really, swimming in a great big pond, trying to make sense of it all.",1155254400,5,1901,4.891304347826087
2501400,4,B000E6ESU8,"Little Fish is a movie that I've been waiting to see. I finally got to see it last night. It lived up to my expectations and was much more exciting then I thought it would be. Performances from Cate Blanchett, Sam Neill, Martin Henderson, and Dustin Nguyen were great (as expected), but the real stars of the movie were Hugo Weaving as the washed up drug addict and Noni Hazlehurst as the concerned mother. The storyline was complex and entertaining and the dialogue was incredibly executed by the writers and delivered by the actors with power and emotion. The cinematography was also nice taking after some of the other films made recently like ""Crash"" and ""Collateral."" It also delves into the very serious subject of drug addiction and handles it with a very rough, gritty look. The Soundtrack is another great feature and gives a sound of it being played under water so it has a kind of murky sound to it. Rent this one if you want to see a terrific film, but be warned that it is extremely depressing.",1154476800,4,1007,4.569060773480663
2501401,4,B000E6ESU8,"I saw this dvd in the previewed section at Blockbuster, not knowing what it was really about.  But my admiration for Blanchett and Neill compelled me to buy it, and I'm glad that I did.

Blanchett's character, Tracy, is trying to get her life back together post drug addiction, but society is slow to forgive a bad, broken-down history. One of my favorite scenes is when she's at the bank and shoves the loan officer's photographs of her children onto the floor, smashing the glass all over the place. Another time she breaks something is at the restaurant, where she finds Jonny with his family. The violent outbursts are certainly in line with her character (understandable, I mean - not excusable). She's frustrated, trying to get money for her business, and turned down (though it is very understandable why the bank would do that, as most financial institutions aren't too keen on the risk of lending to someone who's on their ""second chance"" at anything). Also, she gives her old boyfriend Jonny a second chance, but he ends up deceiving her.

I appreciated how the movie as a whole was unpredictable with great character studies (although I wish Sam Neill's character had a larger role). In the dvd special features section, Blanchett says that she loved how the movie centered on 30 year olds who weren't ""cool"" because they didn't know what they were doing with their lives, still living with parents - and most movies ignore those kind of people and the struggles they face.

The end kind of leaves you hanging. The beach part was beautiful, though I hated seeing the bug near Lionel's eye.

Really sad music, too. I loved the karaoke bits, and the song that was playing in the beginning at the reunion dance party, as well as the song that the children sang. I don't think I can reproduce the lyrics here, but the song is quite intriguing and fits with the movie so well. It's called ""Flame Trees.""",1153612800,57,1909,4.686567164179104
2501402,2,B000E6ESU8,"Perhaps we rented a bad copy, but I missed at least 30% of the conversations because of a combination of strong Aussie accent combined with use of Aussie slang that I couldn't translate quickly enough and just plain bad audio. The words sounded like they were being mumbled at times.

The movie itself was a typical slow moving Aussie film that works hard at character development. If you like films about the intricacies of dysfunctional family relationships you should like this film...if you can hear it.",1149552000,10,507,4.895348837209302
2501403,2,B000E6ESU8,"The opening of the film seems to imply that the story is mainly about Cate's character, but the relationships between the other main characters seem to overwhelm much of the movie.  The characters seem to weave in and out of each other's lives with little to no emotional connection or impact. Maybe this is why Cate's character used to be a drug addict.  Her life is filled with extremely flawed people who seem to care about her, but all of them can barely keep their own lives in check.  This is mainly what the movie seems to be about: the ""small"" people that are apart of drug trafficking.  Often the nature of their relationship is not explained and this seems to be deliberately done.  The confused relationships and the so-called action may make this movie more true to life, but it does not make for worthwhile viewing.  Generally, the movie is mostly wonderfully acted, especially by Blanchett.  Hugo Weaving and the Jurassic Park guy are great as a gay pseudo-couple.  Cate's love interest in the movie is particularly annoying as an unwelcome guest in her life.  The truly awkward scenes between him and Blanchett leave no doubt of their ZERO chemistry. I have no idea why Cate Blanchett chose to act in this film.  But she is the best part of the whole thing. Maybe she was interested in doing a wide variety of roles and nothing else came up.  Or maybe she was impressed with the cast, or she wanted to be in any big Australian film. Despite the artistic quality if the film and great actors, it failed to enagage me because of the confusing relationships, lack of action and seemingly apathetic stance on life: the ambiguous ""action"" scene leaves a lot to the imagination, but no cause for great excitement or alarm in any of the remaining characters.  The movie begins in a dream-like fashion and ends in a dream-like fashion, with a lot of convoluted non-drama in the middle.  Unless you're a huge Cate fan, this movie is miss-able.",1147305600,4,1949,4.647230320699708

They also mumble quite a bit. All of this together makes it difficult to understand what's being said at times.
