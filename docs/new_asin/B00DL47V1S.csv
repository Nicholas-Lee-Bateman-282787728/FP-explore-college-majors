5826568,1,B00DL47V1S,"Terrible movie.
Just terrible.
This movie is why I think the borders of the United States of America need to be secure. All undocumented (re:ILLEGAL) occupiers on American soil need to be found, have ALL handouts from the government cut off and immediately deported.
There is nothing glamorous about reprehensible garbage being forced upon us. Then, to go as far as call us out of line for not tolerating it? Movies like this only further incite divisiveness among the people.
No, I will NOT tolerate this abhorrent behavior.",1383955200,7,525,4.9772727272727275
5826569,5,B00DL47V1S,"You need to watch the original Machete to to fully appreciate this new Machete kills.  Machete continues with the plot in Kills right off the bat. Machete doesn't tweet yet but he sure still knows how to knock um dead.
This is the ultimate flick for guys with some steamy scenes thrown in for the chicks.
I can see that the sequel to Machete Kills is going to be out of this world. How can it get any better than this.",1381708800,13,418,4.160493827160494
5826570,2,B00DL47V1S,"An idea that was at one time nothing more than an ironic gag, Machete eventually evolved into a full length feature film, earning a healthy $44 million.  Written and designed to resemble a low-budget B-movie by Robert Rodriguez, Machete featured a cartoonish lead character that simply couldn't be killed.  Essentially, the Machete character is the Mexican version of Chuck Norris, having a reputation that precedes him, literally making him a living legend.  In humorous fashion, he is surrounded by a supporting cast that's full of high-profile Hollywood actors and actresses (each of which he comically winds up in bed with).  The film has been called violent, absurd, ridiculous - and a work of art.  So, with the success of the first film, it absolutely makes sense to create an even more outrageous sequel, which is appropriately named, Machete Kills.

Co-written with his brother, Marcel Rodriguez, Robert Rodriquez (Desperado, Spy Kids) directs the Machete sequel, Machete Kills - starring Danny Trejo as Machete Cortez, the incredibly deadly former Federale.  U.S. President Rathcock (Carlos Estvez) enlists the help of Machete to stop a mentally disturbed Mexican terrorist, Mendez (Demin Bichir), from launching a missile at Washington D.C.  Matters become complicated when it's revealed that Mendez's heart is directly linked to the missile and in the event that he dies, the missile will launch. Mendez puts a large cash bounty out on his own head, attracting the attention of several local assassins.  Eventually, it's revealed that a wealthy businessman, Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), has been pulling Mendez's strings all along, and has been busy implementing a devious plan for world domination.  A star-studded cast, including Michelle Rodriguez, Sofia Vergara, Amber Heard, Lady Gaga, Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jessica Alba also star in supporting roles.

The Machete films are quite unconventional - to say the least.  They thrive on ignoring nearly every possible plausible scenario and aim to fall squarely in the parody category, which far exceeds the premise of simple fiction.  In all honestly, much like the Scary Movie franchise, you can get away with making one original film in this particular mannerism, but each and every movie that comes after just looks like a sad attempt to reclaim past glory.  Machete Kills is especially disappointing because it does absolutely nothing to build off the first film, basically recycling the same plot as the original - and simply going through the motions of recycling the characters.  In the first film, Steven Seagal was the featured bad guy, but with his eventful demise in the first film, a new ""over-the-hill"" actor was brought in to the play the villain - namely, Mel Gibson.  Still, it was nice to see him back in action.

Machete's character - for better or worse - is absolutely no different in this film than in the first flick.  Danny Trejo pulls off the role of the proverbial bad-ass in commanding fashion.  Easily comparable to a character like The Terminator, Trejo mows down bad guys with relentless ease.  And, like the famous one-liner, ""I'll be back,"" Machete utters his own simple diatribe, ""Machete don't text.""  Naturally, in the sequel, he moves on to his next barb, this time at a social media giant when he utters the predicable yet humorous line, ""Machete don't tweet.""  Honestly, as silly and often times stupid as this movie is, Machete is still able to earn a few cheap sympathy laughs (even though I went right back to crossing my arms and furrowing my brow in disgust).

While the supporting cast of the first film was mostly pretty decent (yes, even Lindsay Lohan), the cast of Machete Kills warrants much more opinionated praise and/or barbs.  For the most part, it shouldn't break anyone's heart that the screen time of both Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez are limited.  They are replaced by much more serious actresses, and by that I mean better.  Amber Heard is a screen-stealing showpiece as the dangerous Miss San Antonio, and even Sofia Vergara raises a few eyebrows with her annoying, yet effective screeching as Madame Desdomona.  Rounding out the noteworthy cameos is Cuba Gooding Jr. and Walton Goggins as the Chameleon, followed by a completely disturbing appearance by Lady Gaga.  Obviously, you can't let Charlie Sheen off the hook (who's credited as Carlos Estvez) without poking fun at this man-whore rendition of the President of the United States.  On a side note, Charlie can now go up to his real-life papa (Martin Sheen) and say, ""look dad, I played the President, too.""

Overall, Machete Kills is an offensive, racist, sexist, monstrosity of a film - and that's obviously the point.  You'll either love these films or completely hate them.  It's almost impossible to be indifferent when talking about Machete.  In the event you enjoyed it, you're likely someone that can look past the cartoon-ish decapitations, helicopter shenanigans, and generic dialogue to find some sort of meaningful enjoyment from a film that could - at its best - be described as a ""popcorn"" movie.  On the other hand, films like Machete Kills create a moderate dust storm of complaints from people that believe the promotion of violence in movies is a negative contributing factor on society, especially to easily impressionable children (defying comprehension why they'd even be allowed to see it).  And, even though this movie is just flat-out obnoxious, you have to at least see the humor in its idiocy.  This movie makes fun of itself, so it doesn't need anyone else to help it along.  The bottom line here is that you will get exactly what you pay for, especially since the first film featured the same amount of head-shaking insanity.

GRADE:  C-

P.S. - It's definitely not evident that Robert Rodriquez is a Star Wars fan.  A lightsaber machete, an appearance by a familiar looking land speeder, and a scared villain wearing a mask...?  Nope, not evident in the least...",1381536000,4,6021,5.064908722109534

5826572,5,B00DL47V1S,"Another audacious chapter in Robert Rodriquez's ridiculous, profane, gory franchise. Make no mistake, this R-rated blood-splattered slaughterfest had us hooting with laughter from the first ""Coming Attractions."" This is about Mexican drug cartels, double agents, the CIA and the President of the United States. Oh...and one muy feo hombre who has done it all. (Watch this ugly man's eyes when they hang him!)

These folks clearly were having a blast:
  * Danny Trejo (""Machete"") The indestructible Machete ""don't text!""
  * Jessica Alba (""Sin City"") Sartana is there when he needs her.
  * Michelle Rodriguez (""Fast & Furious"") Luz is still running a taco stand.
  * Amber Heard (""The Rum Diary"") is Miss San Antonio.
  * Sofia Vergara (Lots of TV) is Desdemona, a madam to die for.
  * Mel Gibson (""Tim"") Luz sees the end of the world and doesn't like it.
  * Alexa Vega (""Spy Kids"") is KillJoy; her name says it all.
  * Demian Bichir (""The Heat"") is Mendez, BOTH of them!
  * Walt Goggins (""Justified"") is La Camalen 1
  * Cuba Gooding Jr (""Don Jon"") is La Camalen 2
  * Lady Gaga (some TV) is La Camalen 3
  * Antonio Banderas (""Desperado"") is La Camalen 4 (great chuntaros!)
  * Carlos Estevez aka Charlie Sheen (""Anger Management"") Mr. President needs help from our hero.

There is no way to justify the glee with which our screening audience greeted each politically incorrect, grisly scene. Action piled upon action, no nudity, lots of fisticuffs and gunfire, but Machete's weapon of choice? Yup, you guessed it...a machete. All that blowie uppie stuff is still for sissies!

5826714,5,B00DL47V1S,"This is a must see for any Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino fans.  (Their work is so similar)..  Reviewing this is somewhat mute as this is a sequel and somewhat dependent on the first film..  If you likes the first film you will like this and if you hated the first film you will hate this.  Be advised that Rodriguez buys his prop blood by the barrel.  You can't compare it to Desperado or Spy Kids.  This fits in with planet terror.  The violent scenes often border on the ridiculous.  I often feel concerned because I laugh at some of the gore, but hay, Chopping someone in half vertically is totally ridiculous.

I often wonder at how he gets the big names for his obviously small budget movies This movie includes; Mel Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Charlie Sheen, Lady Gaga, Cheech Marin, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Elon Musk  All this with a budget of $20 Million.  They obviously want to be in one of his movies.

The first movie had; Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan with  total budget of $10,500,000.

It is interesting that Charlie Sheen is listed in the credits as Carlos Est&eacute;vez which is his real name but I have never seen it used in credits before.

It is also interesting that the Machete character started in a Spy Kids film.  He was Uncle Machete.  The two movies couldn't be more different.

I admit to loving both films and have purchase them on Blu-Ray after seeing them multiple times.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not put off by gore and senseless violence.",1493251200,2,1580,4.618705035971223

5827032,5,B00DL47V1S,"What can be more over-the-top than a Machete movie? This one starts off with a fake trailer among the ""Revues of Coming Attractions"", done Shaw Brothers-style with cheezy music, of ""Machete Kills Again... In Space."" ""He gets the space babes."" ""Eat photons, female dog!"" ""With Justin Bieber as Bleep."" ""And Lady Gaga as... whatever she wants to be."" ""In a land out of space and time""!

And that's just the first two minutes!!

The rest of the movie is cheezy posing, gory cartoon killing (many of them on whims), with each bad guy Twins Peaks-like overshadowed by the next bad guy. There are also at least two Star Wars references. Crazy!

There are a few scene-stealing scenes, by Antonio Banderas and Charlie ""announced that he was HIV-positive that same week"" Sheen, but none of them beat Danny Trejo just being Danny Trejo. I suppose that this outing had a bigger budget than the previous ones, as there are quite a few James Bond-level stunts involving helicopters and speedboats and other craziness. And then, at the end, we get an ageing, chubby Mel Gibson, completely over the top as the supervillain Voz, re-enacting Hugo Drax's ""escape the world"" plot from Moonrakers (oops, sorry - spoiler). And then we get a set-up for... Machete Kills Again... In Space (with yet another trailer to bookmark the film).

5827035,5,B00DL47V1S,"Like a lot of crazy movie fans I love action films.  I loved the movie Machete (A Robert Rodriguez Movie) with Danny Trejo and had to see the second movie in this action series.  I purchased Robert Rodriguezs  Machete kills (starring Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Sopia Vergara, and Amber Heard) for a bargain price on Amazon.

In this non-stop action DVD Danny Trejo is back as the infamous ex-federally Machete Cortez.  In this film Cortez is recruited by the U.S. President (Carlos Estevez) to stop a global terrorist, played by Mel Gibson, from starting a nuclear war.  There is not a whole lot of meaningful dialog in this movie but that is not the reason you would watch this kind of movie.

This movie, along with Machete, is aimed at those strange weird people who love action packed movies and do not care whether or not the plot is developed as long as there is a lot of blood and mayhem flowing.  If you love Danny Trejo movies and liked Machete, you will also love Machete kills. I am glad to see Danny Trejo in more starting roles lately.

In marked contrast, ""Machete Kills"" delivers the goods.  It's over-the-top in every way, from story to violence to stunt casting.  Charlie Sheen as the President?  Mel Gibson as the crazy billionaire?  I'm in.  Your like for this movie will depend on how much you like a movie like this to be over-the-top.  If you're like me, you don't expect realism in something that's supposed to be a modern reimagining of a 70s action movie, and instead you want it to be as big and crazy as it possibly can (the way that the cheap 70s actioners could never be due to budget constraints), you will love this.

5827074,5,B00DL47V1S,"This movie is everything it intended to be, and more. You can't judge a film like ""Machete Kills"" or a director like Robert Rodriguez using ""current box office standards."" first, Rodriguez...like his ""sometimes partner in film"" Tarantino...does what he wants to do, follows his own vision. Both directors obviously have influences up the wazoo...""Machete Kills,"" like Tarantino's ""Death Proof,"" is more about cheesy retro exploitation cinema of the 70s or 80s than it is ANYTHING going on in 2015. But these influences are utilized at will, when they serve the greater purpose of the director. It would be the same as a musician in 2015 writing a song and saying ""let's put a solo in right here like Jeff Beck would have done with the Yardbirds."" It doesn't mean the song has now become a ""tribute"" to either Beck or the Yardbirds. It simply means the artist found that specific influence to be ""useful"" in the moment.

What can you say about a film that features Charlie Sheen (under his real name, Carlos Estevez), as the PRESIDENT, with him playing the role in a way that gleefully exploits every square inch of the tabloid fodder he himself generated? Or crazed madman Mel Gibson in a role that followed his own media inferno that presented him as...well, a crazed madman?

The scorecard: Danny Trejo is everything you would want or need him to be in this role, he just nails it. Amber Heard as ""Miss San Antonio"" is pure evil honey, a joy to behold. Michelle Rodriguez as ""Luz"" is a lot of fun, and she delivers some of the best lines in the script. Sofia Vergara as ""Desdemona: is playing her role in a deliberately over-the-top manner, which...for my tastes...veers close to ""annoying"" at points. The ""La Camale&oacute;n"" role is a master stroke, jointly played by Walton Goggins, Antonio Banderas (amazingly playing the opposite of his ""image""), Cuba Gooding Jr, and Lady Gaga. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s take on the role is especially tasty as he is often cast as the ""voice of conscience"" or the ""stable"" member of an ensemble cast, and here he is just cold and unrepentant evil. Tom Savini is always good for a laugh when he appears in these films. Put that together with Danny, Mel and Charlie, and you have a five-star stab at reliving the past while inventing the future.",1443744000,,2277,4.747474747474747

5827078,3,B00DL47V1S,"I Love the original Machete it was such a different ambitious non Hollywood type film
I had major hope for this follow up to Machete
but, it was pushed back I'm pretty sure twice if my memory serves me correct
I went to the theater to see I was the only person in the theater (7 days after the Friday release) during the afternoon on a Thursday
That speaks volumes to what a complete mess this film is
I've only sat in a empty theater for two films (Rob Zombie's Halloween II & Machete Kills) Both films being sequels
at least Machete Kills is watchable garbage

The Good:
Jessica Alba makes a 3-4 min. cameo and is killed off Thank God!

Mel Gibson as Voz (Major Props for Casting him Mel steals this film he is so damn good as the insane over the top bad guy and there are these odd toys/props that make appearances through out the film

Charlie Sheen as The President this too was a good casting choice with Sheen at the time being all over the gossip sites he makes these odd pop ins but, he too like Mel is gold when you get him
Demian Bichir as Mendez is great also i wish he was in more of this film.... you don't get enough of him imo (If you like him as a Actor check him out in the FX's Americanized version of The Bridge Season 1 & 2) It's awesome!!!!!

The Bad:
Before the Film even started they showed a Mock-up Preview for Machete in Space which had spoilers to Machete Kills (why would they put this in the front of this film?????) after this film would've made sense not before it
The Massive crow-baring of Celebs that didn't need to be in this film
Amber Heard (huge waste of screen time)
Alexa Vega as Kill Joy (cast mostly to help create buzz behind the film she was the kid from the Spy Kids films are grown up playing a Hooker great way to be a father figure Robert Rodriguez
Alex is actually a good actress I'm not sure why she even took this gig it was beneath her anyone could've played this part
I guess she felt obligated or guilted; into it by Rodriguez
Antonio Banderas (just a waste of his talent and time)
Cuba Gooding Jr. (another waste of his talent and time)
Vanessa Hudgens (Cast for her name nothing more nothing less)
Sofa Vergara as Desdemona I can't help but, think this was meant for Salma Hayek
I'll give Sofia credit for doing this but, then after a few minutes it dawned on me Sofi Vergara is this decades Anna Nicole Smith the chick can't act she's stunning and flawless but, no real acting talent at all (She is lucky she was born with flawless beauty it helps her get away with anything)

The Ugly:
El Camalen (This Character is a very smart idea but, somehow it was butchered they should've kept Walton Goggins through-out most of the film swap him out with a scab actor you never see then switch it to Lady Gaga!!
I'm not sure how you can mess up such a interesting idea or yeah by getting all your friends into a movie and allowing them to play El Camaleon just for cameo spots
Lady Gaga is passable for the time she is in it she isn't hate able and loud and over the top like Sofa Vergara.............
The look of this film is different if you compare it to the Original all the cigarette burns/ print damage is gone
it looks very clean and digital
Michelle Rodriguez not enough Michelle Luz is such a great character that works but, you don't get enough of her cause all the celebs that come and go padding the story
Tom Savini is also a waste of a cameo mostly cause he should have more time",1442361600,,3443,4.2343987823439875

I did like revisiting the world of Machete but I'll be happy if Rodriguez puts it away and doesn't ask us to go back.,1421280000,,457,4.585365853658536
5827365,4,B00DL47V1S,"Blake Reviews Machete Kills

As many of you may have guessed, I have a certain affinity for the ridiculous... except the ridiculous Harry Potter spell where they said ridiculous, which was a bit to ridiculous to be in even my realm of ridiculous. But moving on. Part of my love of the ridiculous translates into a love of parody movies. The problem is that most parody movies are... awful, in every sense of the word. But, every now and then I run into an Austin Powers or a Tucker and Dale vs Evil, and my heart is happy again. One such movie which has tragically been overlooked is Machete Kills.

Machete Kills is a action parody with a surprising amount of depth to its satire. In it, Machete is a non-specific action hero, hired by the president of the United States (Charlie Sheen) to go to Mexico to find a psychopathic revolutionary leader and stop him from setting off a nuclear rocket aimed for Washington. Most of this movie's charm comes its subtlety as a comedy. But this means that people will often mistake it as a sincere action movie and find it quite stupid... especially when you know that the next movie in the installment will involve light-saber machetes.

So, without further ado, here is the categorized rating systemimproved from my last post.

Characters 3/5

Yes, yes, I remember what I said about the importance of a character-driven story. However, this being a parody movie, I can forgive it just this one time. And why? Because the characters, in being shallow and completely devoid of reason, are themselves pointing out the ridiculous nature of the characters in actual action movies. If I'm not mistaken, there are more words in this paragraph than there are Danny Trejo lines in the entire movie. But each time he speaks, it's a one-liner that just about kills you, and is reminiscent of all of Schwarzenegger's, Stallone's, and Cruise's roles in action movies. All that being said, there is one personal story-arch, that of the crazy revolutionary, that brought me to tears. That brought a heart of realism into the story, which itself earned the 3 points I've given the character section of this review.

Plot: 3/5

As this is a parody movie, the plot cannot be judged too harshly. It's as ridiculous and predictable as every action movie that exists. However, it is consistent and never makes you feel lost as to the direction that the movie is headed.

Aesthetics 4/5

So it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this movie is no Avatar. Most scenes involve desert landscape, broken towns, and terminator-esque machinery. But, for what it was showing, the movie does an excellent job with the cinematics. There's relatively little shaky camerawhere the cinematographer plays a dirty trick in making you think something awesome has happened by showing something cool with a camera that's too shaky to see what happened. The desert scenes are actually surprisingly light and even beautiful at timesaided by the lighting which makes all of the limited colors very vivid and pleasant. And the props/wardrobe are very innovativemixing the 21st century technological capabilities with the creative impracticality of the 80's and 90's.

Themes/Morals 5/5

First, let me say that themes/morals is not synonymous child appropriateI would advise children to watch this only at an age when they can understand parody and political undertones. There is language, implied sexuality, and over-the-top violence (remember, parody exaggerates everything in order to make fun of how stupid a material is). But in the fact that is is mocking senseless violence and empty sexual encounters, it kind of redeems itself in making an observant audience see the desire for such in themselves. Also, this is one of the first movies that accurately demonstrates the struggles and prejudices in being a Mexican living within the United States. And since Mexican racism is still greatly tolerated in this nationand more openly than manyit is a hard-hitting social criticism and one that will make many people despise the movie.

Drawbacks and Conclusion 4/5

The only drawback I would give this movie is the cliffhanger ending. I'm all for leaving room for a sequel, but there needed to be more of a conclusion to this story. For further installments of the series, I hope that the directors will look at movies such as Austin Powers, which concluded solidly while still making it obvious that a sequel was in the works. Otherwise, this was a solid movie, and one that really should not be missed by parody and comedy lovers. It's entertaining, well-acted by a star-studded cast, and has a solid core of goodness in it that you can take away at the end.

5827371,5,B00DL47V1S,Good movie.,1418860800,,11,5.0
5827372,5,B00DL47V1S,"The first movie, ""Machete,"" isn't bad, but this sequel is far better, and you don't have to see the first movie to get this one. If it's all the same, you can just skip ""Machete"" and watch ""Machete Kills."" This movie is as fun as the first movie, twice as funny, and has a far more consistent mood.

ACTION:

As with the first movie, this one is packed with action both blade and gun based, and it never bothers to be realistic. If you're looking for fight scenes that are realistic and intense, this isn't the movie you're looking for. But the fight scenes are fun, and the gore is fake-looking enough that it isn't too nauseating to watch. The action often overlaps with the comedy, especially with one female character's...*creative* weapons.

HUMOR:

This movie not only has the camp and funny one-liners of the first one, but it's also got more straight-up comedy. The film opens with a short, parody advertisement for the next movie, ""Machete Kills Again...In Space!"" This at first seems like a throwaway joke; but the real movie's plot grows exponentially absurd, until it actually ends with Machete preparing to battle Mel Gibson's mad scientist, in space. The characters are comically over-the-top, often with hilarious names (like ""President Rathcock""). And the action-scenes are often as funny as they are exhilarating.

CHARACTERS:

It's an all-star cast, but the characters are unique and weird all on their own, with the familiar faces just being a bonus. Danny Trejo's Machete is a hilarious parody of the action-movie Mary Sue (much like Barb Wire, or Snake Plisken). Michelle Rodriguez is back as ""the She"" (a female ""Che""), looking badass and sexy as ever with her new eye-patch. Charlie Sheen is the childish, F-bomb dropping, President Rathcock. Sofia Vergara (the step-mom from ""Modern Family"") is a revenge-crazed brothel house mother, who's weapons include a machine-gun bra and a strap-on dildo gun. And then there's the mysterious ""Chameleon,"" a master of disguise, who's various masks are played by Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas, and Lady Gaga. The initial villain is Mendez, a delightfully mad super-villain, who finds the explosive danger he's in to be more exciting than anything else. Finally, there's Mel Gibson as a mad scientist, who happens to be a sci-fi fanboy on the side; his lair is filled with hilarious nerd product placement, resulting in him giving Machete a tour of his lab in a ""Star Wars"" speeder, and later trying to kill him with a Klingon bat'leth.

VERDICT:

Great movie, hilarious movie, and you don't even have to see the first one. Looking forward to ""Machete Kills Again...In Space!",1418342400,,2641,4.9727891156462585

They're the lucky ones because they don't have to endure this travesty.  Absolutely nothing works here.  Lots of comic gore and tongue-in-cheek humor that falls like a lead balloon.  The plot is fragmented and nonsensical to make the film inconsequential.  It seems like they regurgitated the gags that worked in the first film and the faux trailer from ""Grindhouse"" this time to nil effect.  Matters aren't helped by the fact that Danny Trejo, a good character actor, cannot carry a picture by himself.  Trejo's pockmarked face tells more than his thespian skills.

5827508,3,B00DL47V1S,"Tongue-in-cheek is what we expect when we watch a Robert Rodriquez Machete movie.  The 2nd installment of the Machete saga fails to hit the mark that the first one did.  Sure we get Mel Gibson as the bad guy (surprise!) and it has Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba from the previous movie.  But there is something missing.  The over-the-top grandiosity of ultra violence and well-timed jokes falls to tedium.  Maybe with movies like Machete it's best to keep it to one movie.  As with any sequel, what works in the first movie doesn't necessarily translate well into the second or even third movies.  Gags become tired.  Still an  impressive ensemble cast.  Just nowhere near the original.  Danny Trejo is epic, but the plot twists are plodding.  I know you're supposed to view this as you would any spoof flick, but it is definitely harder to swallow and laugh the second time around.  And there's supposed to be a third.

5827717,4,B00DL47V1S,"If you liked ""Machete"", you will enjoy ""Machete Kills"". The over-the-top violence, the awesome score, all of the fun throw-backs to 1970's exploitation flicks are here. And Danny Trejo's titular character is just so much fun watch, you can forgive the film when it goes off the rails because you'll find yourself just enjoying what's happening on-screen.

""Machete Kills"" makes the first ""Machete"" film look realistic. In the second film Machete gets caught between a drug cartel and a madman bent on the destruction of the world. As the second film opens. Machete now working for ICE, sees his partner killed and he is arrested by a murderous sheriff. While being lynched by the sheriff Machete receives a phone call from the President of the United States. The President needs Machete's help in stopping a nuclear missle from being fired into Washington DC by a madman hiding in Mexico. Machete with the help of a call girl is to infiltrate the nuclear madman's base, and destroy the missle.

If you are going into this film looking for a ""serious"" action movie, then you'll hate it. Everything is over-the-top, from the cartoonish like violence, to the laugh out loud cameos. If you just want to have a good time, I highly recommend ""Machete Kills"", it's just too much fun not to.",1401667200,,1283,4.827272727272727

5827780,5,B00DL47V1S,"This movie was really a compilation of classic cult movies, television shows and havoc and comedy in general.  I am not your usual Trejo fan.  I am almost as old as Mr. Trejo and a pasty white female.(Speaking of which MAY 16 GIRLS KISS DANNY TREJO ON MAY 16 FOR HIS BIRTHDAY)  But I am greatly enamored of movies like Pink Panther, James Bond,.Dr Strangelove,Star wars, Lethal Weapon, Rhinestone Cowboy, Desperado, Face Off, Show me the Money, Mad Max, and also love Lady Gaga, Modern Family, and Justified. If you throw all these productions  into a Cuisinart, you'll have this movie!  You had times of excitement, action,  sadness, and laughter at the pure fun the actors were having.  I love anything with lots of explosions, car crashes, dope slaps, gunfire,blood and gore, and fight scenes with tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in. I love seeing strong women (I've been described as a ""make my day"" kind of person or as having a Pit Bull in my background) and the good guy coming out on top in the end. I will never think the same way about ""double D's"" and ""Strap-ons"" after this movie. I love that Mr. Trejo is getting roles now where he gets the girl!  He is leading man handsome and always has been!  He deserves it.  I love his topographically beautiful face and suspect that his scowl muscles got a bit tired in this delightful romp of an action adventure because he successfully prevented himself from smiling or even sneering a bit.  That took a lot of great facial muscle control.  My only disappointment is that it took about an hour into the film before we got to clearly gawk at his impressive upper body.  This man's musculature is outstanding, no matter how old he gets!  Plus, I was delighted to see as he was dining with Voz that the food must have been a bit tough to saw through as his defined shoulder muscles showed as he cut through it. What did they give him to cut, oak kindling?  We also got a great glimpse of his impressive bare chest and tattoos in the ""healing"" pool scene.  I was sorry that they cut the scene of the ""Baby Trejo"" although it was in some of the bonus features, I suspect however, that some the lower body dimensions of certain attributes of that model baby clone were obviously smaller than they would really be if it truly were a Mr. Trejo clone.  (Just guessing based on his macho-ness!) I also have a great deal of respect and admiration for the person Mr. Trejo is when he is ""off the job."" I didn't think it was possible to make a sequel any better than the original Machete, but his was a really great movie and Mr. Robert Rodriguez' genius continues to shine as well as Mr. Trejo's talent! I cannot wait for the third in the series.  Hopefully the third will be followed by a fourth and so on.  If anyone can clean up the evil from the universe it is Mr. Trejo! Keep it up, you guys.

5827815,4,B00DL47V1S,"A spinoff from Rodriguez' fake ""Machete"" trailer in the Rodriguez/Tarantino ""Grindhouse"" double feature, this is the second Machete film which I suppose makes it a franchise now. It's been underrated. A screenplay that isn't quite as good as the first one is made up for with name actors, including small parts and cameos and a better budget for special effects and stunts. If you watch this expecting it to be a dramatic Latino ""James Bond"" or ""Mission Impossible"" genre adventure/thriller, you won't get it and most of it will seem ridiculous, laden with blood and gore. The enormous clue that it isn't should be the fictitious Grindhouse theater intros and trailer for ""Machete Kills Again In Space"" that precedes the main film -- complete with all the scratches, dust and hairs it would accumulate from being run countless times in a theater.

It's a grand Latino spoof of the genre laden with caricatures of both the characters and the action sequences typically found in them, taking what is usually at the edge of credulity and going well beyond it. Sit back in the easy chair, watch it as a parody, appreciate all the impossibilities and absurdities for caricatures they depict and let yourself smile at them. If you don't mind the language and violence, which are an integral part of the parody, it's a fun ""popcorn"" film.

Blu-ray PQ and AQ is very good; no serious issues with them for me; has sharpness and detail levels I would expect from a 2013 production. If I could, I'd give it 3-1/2 stars but not quite 4.",1398556800,,1524,4.747169811320755

5827992,3,B00DL47V1S,"As the films title says, Machete kills again in Robert Rodriguezs Machete Kills. As you know, the original Machete (2010), which started as a fake trailer in Grindhouse (2007), was homage to drive-in/exploitation movies. That doesnt change in the sequel basically, but this time Rodriguez added some sci-fi elements to his project.

So in Machete Kills President of the United States Rathcock (Charlie Sheen under his birth name Carlos Estevez) offers a deal that Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) cannot refuse: save the country from the nuclear missile attack. Machete flies to Mexico, where he confronts a drug cartel leader Marcos Mendez (Demi&aacute;n Bichir), who has been threatening the US government, but he learns things are more complicated than he imagined.

Yes, things get much more complicated, and not in an interesting way. Machete kills lots of baddies in a unique fashion, but halfway through the story the film seems running out of ideas. We see many guest stars in cameo roles (including Antonio Banderas and Lady Gaga), but they are rather wasted. Most of all, it seems as if the film has become a bad movie it has been making fun of.

I like Danny Trejo and enjoyed watching his no-nonsense character doing whatever he is supposed to do, but at the same time I am beginning to feel the one-joke premise of the franchise (yes, Machete will come back again, and thats what the film says) overstays its welcome.",1394409600,,1426,4.933333333333334

The one-liners here are just recycled cliches re-appropriated as would-be badass jokes.

I don't know how the same guy who once thrilled people with DIY excitement of ""El Mariachi"" can concoct such a dull movie. Even the camera's motion and energy in Rodriguez's original faux-John-Woo style has disappeared, replaced with boring shots of people standing still and shooting a gun at each other.

If you think a good punchline is for someone to be suddenly and callously shot and/or celebrity cameos - simple jokes which get driven into the ground here - you might begin to enjoy all this movie has to offer.

Well, you could tell they just had fun with it and it is a bad movie which is what makes it so much fun to watch.  We laughed through the entire movie.  It is not a movie for the squeamish and definitely NOT a movie for kids to see.

I mean let's face it I think we can all agree he has got to be the ugliest person  alive...sure it was a hoot to see such a cosmetically challenged person being the main character in a grindhouse version of a James Bond movie but I'm over that.
Also Danny is hardly what I would call an accomplished actor unless you count really super low budget movies and when pitted against the likes of Mel Gibson well let's just say Danny all but disappears off the screen.
Most of the time he just stands looking ugly and clueless and lost.
His lines are basically limited to ""Machete don't tweet"" and other eloquent things like that.
Machete don't do much except wait for others to save his ass and occasionally pull a logic defying stunt that barely entertains or justifies why he is considered such a badass.
I find it kinda funny that Mel Gibson's character (SPOILER AHEAD) gets his face burned  so bad that he has to start wearing a mask (done I think because Mel's character will be featured in the third Machete but Mel won't be reprising the role so they had to hide that fact) but we have to look a Danny's ugly mug all the time.
Now enough of moldy cheddar face, on to the movie.
I think someone is trying a little to hard to make this franchise the grindhouse tribute they are going for.
In the original, near the end when Lindsay Lohan's character dressed up as a nun and then armed with two uziz's joined the final gunfight, I kinda threw up in my mouth a little bit.
This movie is that and then some.
If you didn't really like the first Machete then stay the hell away from this one.
Ugly, untalented as far as acting goes, and not all that big or physically imposing....so why not kill off Machete and leave him out of the entire series from this point on seeing as he is the weakest link?
Sure you'd have to rename it to something else but it be worth it in the end.",1391212800,,1973,4.301075268817204

That move right there kinda ruined the whole movie for me, why would you want to waste such beautiful talent at the very t beginning ?
  An with that move, the rest of the movie got really stupid from there on out, Charlies role as president was a half ass good call,  ( I don't know his real given first name yet ) but he was his normal self though.
  Then as the show progressed, it just kept getting stupider. It didn't start to get any better until he actually got across the border, then that's where the fun an excitement really got started, an I am starting to think OK here we go. But then the stupid came back about 5 - 10 minutes from the end the president want to send Machete into outer space.
  So in the next installment of this movie "" Machete Kills Again ""  are you for real right now ?

Maybe Robert Rodriguez never did grow up. Who knows, but anyway, if it wasn't for the gorgeous girls all over this film, I surely wouldn't waste my time watching this one a second time.

Gore, humor, B-grade silliness, and big-name celebs hamming it up and having a blast.  What could MACHETE KILLS offer to equal that, let alone top it?

Answer: more stars.  More silliness.  A plot as ludicrous as you could possibly imagine.  Our titular antihero is recruited by the President of the United States (up-and-comer Carlos Estevez, who looks strangely familiar).  It seems there's a revolutionary down in Mexico (the delightful Demian Bichir) with a split-personality; one of those personalities has a missile aimed at Washington, D.C., wired to go off if he dies.  Machete kidnaps the madman, only to find out he's the pawn in a much larger game, being played by a much more sinister madman, armed with space-age technology and dreams of a newer, better, bloodier world.

Danny Trejo and Robert Rodriguez always make a bloody good pair.  We've got a plethora of celebrity cameos and supporting roles to entertain you for a couple hours: Amber Heard, Alexa Vega, Sofia Vergara, Antonio Banderas, Walter Goggins, Lady Gaga, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Vanessa Hudgens, William Sadler, Tom Savini, Michele Rodriguez, and Jessica Alba.  Sound fun?  How about Mel Gibson as a scene-stealing, future-seeing, wisecracking super villain?

MACHETE KILLS isn't for everyone.  It's for people who enjoyed the first MACHETE film, and who can't wait to see a film entitled MACHETE KILLS AGAIN...IN SPACE.  It's bloody, it's funny, it's epic Grindhouse cinema with a big budget and big names.  A-list stars cutting loose and having a little fun for once.

The film makes fun of society, especially beauty pageants.  Charlie Sheen as president? The film has major league stars lining up to take part of the fun.

This is perhaps the quirkiest in the series, taking the franchise in a new direction. There are flashbacks to a previous film, but knowledge of past films are not necessary, its a grindhouse. We watch it for hot girls with guns talking tough, heads getting cut off, and the explosions.

But this one just never grabbed me. Felt like it was trying too hard, or something.

The effects and stunts didn't seem nearly as good, either. I mean, all of Rodriguez's movies feature ridiculously improbably situations and stunts, but they all _look_ real. Like, they make me believe someone could really do those things (almost), because the stunt looks believable (enough). But here, everything just looks so fake... the pacing felt off... the jokes were more goofy than funny (especially Mendez's corny flip-on-a-dime personality changes). The camera work felt a lot closer to Naked Gun - comedy, rather than action.

  I don't follow or care about Mel Gibson's personal life, so I don't hate him and still am a big fan. However, he's wasted here even despite a some-what funny Mad Max tribute scene. A lot of other well known actors and....Lady Gaga pop up which would be fun if they weren't gone as quick as they appear. Charlie Sheen is in as the President throughout and fairs a little better.
  The main problem though is that it's too long, all the repetitive non-stop violence gets more boring than entertaining after awhile. Spoiler: It also ends with a cliffhanger for a part 3 with not that great of an ending. And a part 3 isn't likely after Machete Kills wasn't too much of a success.

If you want to watch a politically incorrect, chopping up the bad guys, great cameos and hot looking women kind of movie then you have to watch this one. Can't wait for the next one but will watch this one many times in the mean time.

5828828,4,B00DL47V1S,"This isn't a bad film, unless you compare it to the first in the series. What I loved about Machete was the fast pace and how much of my attention it grabbed (I couldn't turn away). The first film also had multiple plot lines that converged in the end where as this film had one strong plot line and almost pointless sub-plots. Overall I hope the third (if it occurs) does better, making this more of an empire strikes back film.",1389139200,,429,4.308641975308642
5828829,5,B00DL47V1S,"If you like to see the same old thing recycled over and over again and continually sold to you as the new greatest movie, while trying extremely hard to cover up all its flaws; then this movie is not for you. If you want to get what you expect and love movies in general than this movie is for you. Look Robert Rodriguez does not hide anything from you unlike these other ""blockbuster"" movies, who try way to hard to make a good action movie and have a great idea for the action but no story to wrap it in. Instead they think that you will be so caught up into the action that you will not pay any attention to how bad the story or acting is and hope you will be fooled by the explosions and special effects. Robert brings all of the short comings of these major films and brings them front and center right from the get go. He is basically saying this is an action movie and you will get action and he is no trying to pretend like he is going to wrap a good story around it and ultimately make you feel like you wasted your money because the story is pure garbage, but rather give you completely outrageous action sequences that make no sense and have huge gaps it, but you won't care, because you know from the start this what you are getting. There is no need to go into breaking down the story or the acting like the others have because there isn't much to breakdown. I honestly believe that Robert worked harder on this movie than most other film directors do on big hits just for the simple reason that he had to take a turd and polish it(it's possible ask the Mythbusters). He took a 1980s action movie and made it more outrageous than it already is. This movie is fun, gross, and non-stop, and it deserves to be purchased by anyone who takes the time to read these reviews period.",1389139200,2,1788,4.215743440233236
5828830,1,B00DL47V1S,"Really terrible sequel to the overlong and overrated Machete that makes the first film look like Airplane and Hobo with a Shotgun rolled into one.  Robert Rodriguez genuinely doesn't seem to understand that making an intentionally bad movie isn't funny and that  a homage to B movies doesn't have to be an endless camp fest.  For two examples of filmmakers who got the grind-house thing right check out House of the Devil, which is a perfect recreation of an early 1980's horror film and Hobo With A Shotgun, a homage to Italian post-apocalyptic thrillers from the early 1980's like 1990: The Bronx Warriors and 2019: After the Fall of New York.

Rather than make good homages to the B movies that he supposedly loves Robert Rodriguez went in entirely the opposite direction with Planet Terror and his two subsequent Machete flicks--turning his films into stupid comedies that reduce the movies he is supposedly paying tribute to to Ed Wood level atrocities--although Plan Nine from Outer Space is actually far more entertaining than any of Rodriquez's stabs at intentionally bad film-making.

The plot of this one concerns Machete's assignment to kill an insane (literally) Mexican terrorist who stole a powerful missile and has it aimed at Washington.  Unfortunately the detonator for the device turns out to be hardwired to the terrorist's heart so killing him isn't an option--Machete must smuggle the insane target back into the US to the only man who can turn off the device, a crazed American arms dealer who is actually the one behind everything.

Demian Bechir (The Bridge) plays the Mexican terrorist with a violent split personality and Mel Gibson plays the arms dealer.  They are literally the only two actors in the entire movie who don't seem to realize that they are in a campy crap-fest and that they aren't actually expected to act--Bechir makes his character both crazed and sorrowful and Gibson is an effective 1970's era Bond villain.  Machete Kills is pretty watchable when at least one of them is on-screen--but the rest of the time it's just tedious and unfunny.

The Weinstein Brothers who produced the first Machete as well as Grindhouse passed on this sequel.  Whether that was because of the participation of Mel Gibson or simply because they thought a sequel to a movie that flopped wasn't a very good idea, let's all hope Rodriquez doesn't find any patrons to finance the next threatened sequel--Machete Kills...In Space!  Robert Rodriguez's one-joke idea of parody couldn't sustain even his segment of Grindhouse from beginning to end--it's time to go back to actually trying to make movies that don't suck.",1387584000,6,2637,5.009153318077804
5828831,2,B00DL47V1S,"I loved the first Machete, it made me become a fan of Danny Trejo. When I heard a sequel to this was coming out, I couldn't wait to see it. Now that I have seen it... WTF man?

The first film did have some moments that where over the top, but this one... it's WAY too over the top. Too much BS in the way of invincibility, attitudes, and sci-fi effects. I thought the opening scene of a trailer for Machete 3 was kind of funny, but I did not expect it was for real.

The movie kicked off decent, but a scene soon follows with the execution of Machete. And the way that plays out just seemed TOO over the top, even for slapstick comedy. Machete then finds himself asked to meet with the president of the USA, played by Charlie Sheen who is asking him to go into Mexico and take out a revolutionist who plans to destroy the world. However, things don't go right for Mr Bond as usual, and 007, I mean Machete finds himself in trouble and having to save the day.

There was a few cool elements of the film. But quite a few things they tried that where just over kill. I will try not to spoil it, but imagine an action star does one movie, and he has, say a really big gun. Then the sequel movie comes out and his gun was upgraded to something even bigger, but in the same sequel they upgrade and make it bigger and bigger 3 or 4 times in the movie. It's overkill and was not needed.

There where some laughable gore moments, but in the end, nothing all that memorable as anything more than a cheap joke effect. Danny Trejo pretty much stays true to his original character... he is getting a bit more up to date with technology, but that's OK, it's believable... The character of the Chameleon who is played by 100 different actors however was not, and a pretty pointless character for the most part other than being played by Cuba Gooding Jnr, Lady Barf Barf and Antonia Banderas.
Rodriguz plays the same character she does in every other movie... you know, the chick with an attitude problem and thinks she's Lara Croft with The Incredible Hulks muscles... only this time she has an eye patch and the acting ability of a rubber mask. Mel Gibson plays a pretty bad role. His character is not believable. Something tells me he phoned in most of his scenes.

What's even worse... it's all left unfinished, and will be explained in ""Machete Kills Again... In Space"" ........ I kid you not. *face palm* next adventure, Trejo 007 remaking Moonraker with bad Star Wars visual effects. ..... WHY????????? Why mess up a decent first film, and then go and do this to it?

I won't say don't watch it... cause I know you Trejo die hard fans will go and watch it anyway. But don't go clicking the button to say this review was unhelpful, just because you think Trejo couldn't possibly make a bad film?... especially seeing as how good the first was, I'm just giving you an honest review and not saying the movie is 5 stars just because it's Trejo in a sequel to a good film. ... god, would you honestly give Trejo 5 stars for that Home Alone-esk movie he did? We can be honest here, a name doesn't justify 5 stars every time they make a flick.",1386806400,6,3127,4.309523809523809
