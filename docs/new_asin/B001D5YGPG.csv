3526080,3,B001D5YGPG,"I purchased this DVD as a possible addition to our church library.  After watching it with my 12 year old and 18 year old, it was our thought that the intensity level was a bit high for young children.  This DVD features some war scenes with gun fire, animated blood, and emotional distress (fearful children, etc).  The makers definitely do a good job at representing the peril faced by Gladys Aylward and everything seems to be accurate in recounting her trails.

Review Update 11/03/12: Since writing this review, I have had several other families review this DVD. They had multiple children much younger than mine (Ages 4+). In both cases, the families did not find this DVD too intense for their young children. So, I am revising my review to note that for most children, the intensity level it does not seem to be a problem. However, if you have children sensitive to this type of content it may be intense for them to watch.",1346716800,10,931,4.624242424242424
3526081,5,B001D5YGPG,This is a super way for parents to introduce one of the great hero's of our faith. It is a worthwhile effort and small cost which is also fun for the children.,1300492800,2,159,4.0
3526082,5,B001D5YGPG,Great animated movie! It made such a positive impact that me and my 7 year old daughter cried. The power of God on this woman was astounding!,1287446400,,141,4.2592592592592595
3526083,4,B001D5YGPG,"We have several of the Torchlighter videos for my 5/6 year old. The quality does make it hard to compete with mainstream productions, never-the-less, the stories are heads and shoulders above anything else out there (and I think even kids can appreciate the reality behind them). This story on Gladys Aylward is a great encouragement and not too scary for most kids. As always the documentary that accompanies the cartoon is very helpful for the parents.",1274745600,,454,4.9868421052631575
3526084,5,B001D5YGPG,It is wonderful that the life story of a beautiful person can be on DVD for viewing by children and others. Inspiring! Well done!,1264809600,,129,4.416666666666667
3526085,5,B001D5YGPG,"The Torchlighters cartoons are nothing short of excellent-- especially the Jim Elliot, Eric Liddel & Gladys Aylward DVD's. I show them to a group of (previously) ""unchurched"" children, of whom many of which have become new believers through Bible story teaching and weekly preaching at an afterschool program in the neighborhood... I have also been keeping these cartoons in heavy rotation and the kids LOVE them. They watch the cartoons over and over again and never get bored. Best of all these cartoons are GOSPEL SATURATED. They have even brought myself, a 20 year young adult, to tears (occasionally) while watching. Praise God! Please keep making these cartoons at all costs! Thank you.",1242691200,8,692,5.132743362831858

8291790,5,B001D5YGPG,"My son (7) came home from MOPPETS telling me all about this movie. I could tell that it really made him think and want to know more about the people in these videos. I was delighted when I found it on Amazon. It has been watched several times and they still enjoy it.

I am hoping to add to this collection.",1446681600,,307,4.032786885245901

8291796,5,B001D5YGPG,"This is my third favorite after the Richard Wurmbrand Story and the Samuel Morris Story.  What a tenacious and kind lady - so respected by her Chinese brothers and sisters, including ""The Mandarin"".  The music is pretty and the storyline is heart-rending as she uses every ounce of her being to care for the children and lead them to safety.",1385942400,,341,4.666666666666667
