7930567,5,B000053V4C,"I find this DVD, originally duped in video tape, to contain a high educational value. Most people, apart from homicide investigators and serious crime  police, wouldn't have a chance to watch a hospital pathologist at work and also hears  a running commentary as he proceeds to  dissect  a human cadaver. I use to wonder how the dissection is done in a hospital mortuary until I got to see this documentary. The procedures are  orally described  in a clear and concise language which viewers can understand without difficulties at all. It is like attending a forensic pathological class without the smell of formaldehyde! There is no technical jargon. This documentary would also be suitable for  those technicians, would-be embalmists and aspiring doctors and nurses to watch. As a matter of fact, the entire operation was performed by Dr. Noguchi, Chief Medical Examiner of the Los Angeles together with his two assistants. Dr. Noguchi, at one time, was involved in the famous autopsy of the late Marilyn Monroe.  I strongly recommend this to the curious and forensic buffs including the police personnel who is normally  not involve in forensic investigation. Excellent instructional material, though the price is a bit stiff. Thanks.",1156464000,9,1237,5.175879396984925
7930568,1,B000053V4C,"Being a huge fan of forensic science books, television shows and movies I thought this would be something I'd enjoy.  Turns out I was wrong.  This film appears to be a cheap, quick attempt to cash in on the popularity of this subject. Only fans of gore could possibly enjoy this.  Watch the ""Autopsy"" series on HBO instead.",1127433600,12,323,4.5344827586206895
