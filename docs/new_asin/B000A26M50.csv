It is very interesting to know that when films started coming out (mostly to the theaters as entertainment, as leisure was becoming an American way of life) that some of the content was actually intended to be educational.

This was a wonderful buy, and it was a great rainy day film for my class (6th grade)

Thanks!",1297209600,,460,4.597560975609756
8185962,1,B000A26M50,"I thought i was purchasing a documentary on the history of motion pictures. What I got was a bunch of old movie clips, in a horrible 2 dvd set that looks like a bootleg copy. The dvd menu programming is like something you might find in your cousin's wedding dvd (the one your aunt created and burned herself in her pc using some lowsy free software). Both discs have three options in the menu: one takes you to 3 or 4 ramdom movie clips, and the other two options take you to [...] advertising clips.

A real masterpiece of film research.",1275696000,,538,4.326732673267327
8185963,5,B000A26M50,"I bought this DVD set because I'd purchased a bunch of the Edison film reels from t his company and wanted to see some more. These films are not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised. They give you a good overview of how movies are made and more imporatntly, why making movies is important. The best part is the section on how to make a good documentary. I got absorbed into the subject matter and enjoyed the practical advice the DVD set offered.",1153094400,6,456,4.376470588235295
8185964,5,B000A26M50,"Unlike some of the other films I've ordered from this production house, this film doesn't really exist for the historic or enterainment value.

Honestly, it's a training film to show teachers how to make films to help teach various subjects to their students.

I'm giving it five stars, because for what it is, the film does a great job and the sound and video quality are very, very high.

I think that if you wanted to learn how to make high end educational films or were studying to be a teacher this would be a very good buy.",1146528000,7,529,4.377551020408164
