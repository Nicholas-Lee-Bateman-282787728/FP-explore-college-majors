5935146,5,B00EROS5TS,I did not receive it yet but I did a lot of changes on my body with Buffie's quick workout demos on YouTube. Can't wait for this DVD to be delivered :) I recommend because I know Buffie's workouts WORK!!,1379548800,22,203,4.1
5935147,5,B00EROS5TS,Great for gluts,1425340800,,15,4.333333333333333
5935148,5,B00EROS5TS,This makes my buns burn! Great workout dvd,1420761600,,42,4.375
5935149,5,B00EROS5TS,A very good workout.  I was able to keep up so this is good for beginners but be ready to sweat and be sore.  I already feel a difference in my glutes.  I plan to do this workout 3 times a week.,1420329600,2,194,3.5714285714285716
5935150,3,B00EROS5TS,It's suitable if you are looking for legs and glutes workout.  It's her first video and it kind of has that new-to-this feel.  I prefer videos with few edits.  I like it when the instructor does the full workout as the viewer would.  I use weighted shorts when working out with this dvd. She doesn't give many tips on how to modify or intensify but if you are familiar with working out you can do it on your own.,1420243200,9,412,4.177215189873418
5935151,5,B00EROS5TS,To be honest...I'm not your typical Puerto Rican. Unfortunately I don't have the ever desirable hour glass figure that many woman have. When I found out about this DVD ..... I had to have it. After months of debating whether I should purchase it or not....i got it! This workout is something else. The stretching and mini cardiovascular section took so much out of me...but I kept on going. 10 min after...i had to stop because I couldn't continue anymore...i was working out muscles I didn't think I had. Within the week....i did notice a change in my lower body...which is something I have been desiring to have. All in all...i think it's a great workout that you should take your time on. Once you workout to a level you feel comfortable with...you will see a difference just like I did (and I didn't even get through the whole workout),1407456000,29,839,4.6
5935152,5,B00EROS5TS,Great for lifting your butt up higher mixed it with smart lipo on lower abs for that perfect shape,1407110400,4,98,4.2105263157894735
5935153,5,B00EROS5TS,This video is a great way to build tone and tighten your legs and Glutes! I give it 5 stars great workout this is a good way to start she has a menu inside the DVD that helps you build curves or to get lean and cut you choose. IT REALLY WORKS TRY IT!!!!! :),1406851200,15,257,3.690909090909091
5935154,5,B00EROS5TS,I love my dvd if it burns then it is working my body will be perfect I n a couple of months,1405036800,3,91,3.1818181818181817
5935155,1,B00EROS5TS,This was crap! Do not waste your money there are better free workouts on online and on youtube then this! I sure learned my lesson...,1401840000,,133,4.36
5935156,5,B00EROS5TS,"This is  great depending on your body type and how you metabolize fat you will start to see changes quickly. I haven't really worked out in a year and would only do a little bit to keep me going like walking. So in the beginning just the warm-up was pushing me to the limit. Now I can do a warm-up and a work-out, and I'll do one more work-out before bed. I had it about a month and work out at least 3 times a week. and my thoughts a a whole lot slimmer, I have more energy, and my gluteus maximus has lifted, I broke the band so have to get another one. but I will continue working out. Sometimes I just start doing a couple of the moves through the day. But if you love to do squats you will love this one. I believe it will take 6 months to see better results. But I'm the type of person when I start working out my booty is the first to go so far its still there and lifted! I believe this a great workout to do with out losing your curves. Now all I gotta do it is work on my abs and arms I recommend this to be part of your regular workout. I love the positive attitude Buffie has and she is knowledgeable on the muscles and how to work them. Just wish there was a little more time when transitioning to enforce proper technique but all in all it is a well put together DVD and she does go over the technique at first. Great Job, positive  strong, black woman Ms. Carruth.",1401667200,19,1379,3.9568345323741005
5935157,5,B00EROS5TS,"OMG! I thought this was going to be easy, but she works the mess out of you! Easy to follow, nice pace.  She targets the areas us women needs to work on.",1400716800,13,153,3.78125
5935158,5,B00EROS5TS,"It's easy you will say ""Man this workout did not do nothing. The next day you will reallly feel it. Love it.  Easy for a beginner like me",1398643200,14,137,3.892857142857143
5935159,4,B00EROS5TS,Buffie did a great job at bringing on the sweat. For me this is a great workout concentrating in the lower parts of the body. At times the camera work could have been better. Especially when she tells you a move and you can't see her do it. Other than that I would purchase this video again. Get ready to be in pain! The good kind though.,1398643200,8,338,4.059701492537314
5935160,4,B00EROS5TS,Got my dvd about three days ago. .. she really works you out.. you can feel the burn exactly where she say you will feel... I can't wait to see how my butt look in thirty days...,1398124800,2,178,3.8378378378378377
5935161,2,B00EROS5TS,The video was just ok. The instructor was not motivating at all barley talks too you she should have better instructions a least let your audience know how what u doing helps the body. But again it was still just ok,1394928000,6,215,4.2682926829268295
5935162,5,B00EROS5TS,"I did this for the first time yesterday and I am sore in all of the right places, I can see how her body is like it is. I am going to attempt to do this up to 3 times a week, along with keeping up my other workout routines.",1391126400,7,223,3.48
5935163,5,B00EROS5TS,I love it. It's short and effective. Buffie crested this workout for those who wanted to build and enhance curves.,1390003200,15,114,4.75
5935164,4,B00EROS5TS,I've been doing this DVD for about 2 weeks now and I can already see a change in my body! I like the pace. It's a slow burn but It will still make you sweat.,1388102400,12,157,3.5142857142857142
5935165,4,B00EROS5TS,"It's not as intense as I thought it would be but it's great; maybe because I'm not a beginner. I lift weights at the gym and there are times when I just want to workout at home. This will be my 2nd leg day workout which I will buy heavier weights to performs this. Other than that it was awesome, my sister is a beginner and we worked out together; she couldn't walk the next day lol. I will be buying heavier weights to intensify the workout. (I Just wish she had an ""Ab"" section on this DVD). Maybe on her next DVD she'll have an ab section.",1387065600,14,543,4.037037037037037

8608814,5,B00EROS5TS,I give this 5 stars!! I lovw how thick and toned my thighs have gotten. My butt is also round and bigger. The workout is abiut an hour so you will feel the burn. It did not use weights for this I used a resistance band and I say myself a band will work just the same or even better!,1528156800,,282,3.716666666666667
8608815,2,B00EROS5TS,Not for beginners.,1521244800,,18,5.333333333333333
8608816,5,B00EROS5TS,"""Bubble butt bubble bubble bubble butt.."" this DVD gave me just that!! I was rather sceptical on purchasing this DVD as I am quite petite ( 28G bust, 33inch hips) I've done some of buffies YouTube videos and saw some satisfying results. But after much thought I took a chance and bought this DVD. And I am so glad I did!! My butt is 6 dimensional now!! This dvd will be with myself until the end of time and I'll never lend it to anyone either!!! 10/10 uk",1494374400,,455,4.181818181818182

8608821,5,B00EROS5TS,"Great DVD, simple but good production. Really a unique workout DVD.",1436140800,,67,5.181818181818182
8608822,1,B00EROS5TS,"The customer service she provides is terrible.
She refuses to complete my order and when I complained she ignored my email and she erased the comments I posted on her FB page for Bodynomics and blocked me from commenting again. I explained I did not get what was promised and she told me too bad I would have to reorder and pay. So sad a sister that is a former video vixen that is ""trying"" to make it has such a bad attitude. She needs to realize to gain a customer base you have to always attempt to please your customer. That is what may be the difference in her not being able to branch off into stores and have a successful career, such a Jane Fonda, Shaun T and so many other big names in the business. Her video is no longer on Amazon. The video was average at best. It really needed music or extra people in the video. The camera work is very amateur. I will never buy anything with her name attached. What a waste of my money.",1427068800,9,935,4.142857142857143
