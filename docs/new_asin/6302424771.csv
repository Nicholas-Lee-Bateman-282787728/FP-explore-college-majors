7826990,3,6302424771,"Well...this film for the most part was well intended. It was supposed to be a pilot for a TV series for Roger Daltry so he could enter the american market. Dennis waterman is a british veteran actor who also served as producer of this film which was about a boxer and a priest. I also recognized him much later to my surprise as a featured actor in an old Dracula movie starring Christopher Lee. Although he had my respect for that, this effort didn't quite roll over with the audience and critics alike. It was made in Chicago and does show the panoramic views of old neighborhoods no longer there. The only fond memories of this film was I got my screen actors guild card from playing a small part in the film as a cop ( I arrested Daltry after fighting his pit bull and got bit for real) and got to work with some old head chicago actors and a fun british camera crew ( yay Dennis Green  DP!)from whom I learned about cameras and lenses. If you liked old Chicago before the facelift, make this part of your collection along with ""Thief"", ""Blues Brothers"" and ""Damien Omen II"".",1351209600,,1079,4.3681592039801
7826991,3,6302424771,"Despite Dennis Waterman's not having much good to say about this film in his autobiography REMINDER, I felt lucky to have found a copy of the VHS.  While it is not my usual taste in movies, I watched it objectively.  The Father Jim role was not developed sufficiently; at least, not as well as the boxer role.  The supporting roles were very well portrayed.  I may be gullible, but I didn't believe Father Jim was a con man, despite the circumstantial evidence - and the description on the box.  However, that final scene was something.  Gave me nightmares, probably because I've become quite a fan of Mr. Waterman after seeing some of his other work.  Even if this movie wasn't a commercial success, it does give the viewer a lot to think about.",1280188800,,746,4.56390977443609
