8214328,4,B000UPPK14,"""Class on Demand: Basic Training for Adobe CS3 Production Premium: Adobe Educational Training Tutorial DVD includes Premiere Pro CS3"" is a great starting point for those users who want to get a look at what all of the programs bundled in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Creative-Suite-CS3-Production-Premium/dp/B000OGSYK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Creative Suite CS3 Production Premium</a>&nbsp;can do. The 4.5 hours of video are well laid out and provide a good overview of the capabilities and workflow when using these Adobe programs to achieve great results. The chapters include:

1-On Location
2-Ultra (for Windows Users Only) or Keylight in After Effects (for Mac Users Only)
3-Soundbooth and PremierePro
4-Illustrator
5-Photoshop
6-After Effects
7-Encore
8-Flash

The Flash chapter was a little weak and those not doing chromakey (greenscreen) might not get a ot out of chapter #2, but otherwise a strong training video!

Highly recommended, especially for those new to the Adobe package!",1219536000,4,1052,6.291666666666667
