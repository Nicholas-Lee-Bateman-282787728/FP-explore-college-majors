This movie could have been made and told in 5 maybe 10 minutes.  Sooooo slow and almost pointless.  The only thing you can take away from this movie is ""Don't be mean to people"".",1385078400,,321,4.19672131147541
8393997,5,B003BV8HVY,"Autopilot was not at all expected and very touching. The main character, Tanner was both trying and charming. His sister was easy to associate with even though she was handling something not many of us can understand. Shannon Lucio  is so human and normal in the movie it makes you want to reach in and give her hug and tell her everything will be okay. Tanner's friend Mike is also a great guy who really seems to be on his friends side but the awkward moments that come with dealing with such circumstances are played so naturally by all characters it really makes the movie all the more haunting. There are plenty of dark undertones and the movie will leave you feeling a little bewildered.

I walked away from the movie thinking a great deal about the subtle little bits that you only really pick up on once you've spent a few moments away. Any movie that can keep you thinking after it's been played is a good movie.",1341187200,,921,4.443786982248521
8393998,5,B003BV8HVY,"The film Autopilot was recommended to me on amazon.com, and I have to say it really surpasses the typical Indie fare.  The lead (played by Alex Knudsen) plays Tanner, a troubled man having just being released from a mental institution, that he has been in since childhood.  He convincingly plays a grown man that had his social development skills stunted, and trying to make sense of this new world he`s been released into.  He's somewhat able to  come out of his shell around his sister Sara (played by Shannon Lucio) who takes him in and tries to readapt him into society.  I don't want to give any more away when it comes to story and how it ends, but let's just say it is dark, and dream-like.

Check out the hilarious making-of featurette, the outtakes, and the commentary track.

The guy playing Tanner is largely unknown, but you'll likely recognize the rest of the cast since they have had supporting roles in film and TV (for instance Gregory Itzin, who played President Logan on `24').  Look them up on imdb and you'll see what I mean.",1277251200,,1045,4.580645161290323
