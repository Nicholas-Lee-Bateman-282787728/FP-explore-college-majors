3147273,3,B0015SBNCA,"Depending on where you are on your journey...
I would say it is a good DVD for people at the begining of self exploration, with a growing thirst for spiritual awareness. It makes you question, wonder, consider possibilities. Maybe some pictures or words will trigger something critical in you. Maybe not at all. I was personnally disappointed with the content (not much) while I expected to be stimulated like I was with ""What the bleep down the rabbit hole"" (extended version) which I found great. Nevertheless, with this DVD it was good to appreciate the feeling that indeed some part of humanity is awakening as many teachers/explorers from different backgrounds participate openly to the discussions.
Concerning the kind of experiences discussed in the DVD, I was much more deeply impacted by a book I have recently read : ""When the impossible happens, adventures in non ordinary realities"" by Stanislav Grof, one of the most experienced scientist in the field of consciousness applied to psychology. For it helped me trusting the tranformation process I have been going through the past months, integrating non ordinary states of consciousness more peacefully, states that I used to find so daunting because so challenging from the perspective of a conventionnal scientific way of thinking/perceiving reality (was I going nut? :-). Stan Grof insists on the nature of what he calls ""spiritual emergencies"" to describe some states that are still seen as psychosis/insanity by mainstream psychiatry for instance. So very helpful, because the awakening process is not so easy...
As for the stimulation of the debate concerning what is consciousness, I can only quote the beautiful words of J. Kornfield : ""I love Grof's wild and true stories, an amazing scientist, he offers a vast, mysterious perspective that opens our minds like a huge stary sky.""
That which ""Spirit space"" didn't trigger as I imagined it would.",1215993600,18,1916,5.163987138263666
3147274,2,B0015SBNCA,"I was looking forward to recieving this DVD very much, but i would not have bought it had i known how little content there is. Also, the DVD was loose inside it's cover from New Zealand to Norway, i'm amazed my DVD player even accepted it, being so scratched up. So i was not impressed (although the quick delivery did impress me).

My hope was that this could be a movie that gave some new angles on spirit, thought and how these might relate to quantum cohersion. Or hopefully some hard evidence from tests done by scientists on meditation and positive thinking. I know it works from personal experience, but it's always easier to share these things if you can back it up with a documentary based on facts.

Since Fred Alan Wolf takes part in the movie, i figured it would have some scientific backing. But to my shock and horror-- Wolf starts talking about how he wakes up in someone-elses body, watching them pee(!) How exactly does this help the spiritual community? This is the stuff lunatic fringe novels are made from. Wolf seems to be a fun and lively guy, both smart and mad at the same time (like most scientists) - but this time he went to far for my taste. True or not, you have to at least introduce a context where these things can be understood. Otherwise it's fairy land from beginning to end.

I gave it two stars because it does have an uplifting message: Believe you can do it, and life responds! And that message is important. And i think the movie is a good idea on behalf of the makers. They show initiative - but fail's to back it up with any serious bridge-work. That needs to be done before you claim the title: spirit space.

All in all - i didn't mind watching it, and i don't mind supporting a good cause. But if this was a rental, i would never have rented it again.

A good idea, some nice sequences. That's it.",1214524800,19,1842,4.358600583090379

There are LOTS of cases of past life memories in children, lots of cases of psychic abilities, lots of cases  of near death experiences, etc., but this DVD does not interview any of them.

This film does not claim to be proof for reincarnation, OBE's, past lives or life after death but it does a great job in telling the viewer that something more than we can perceive is happening and their are ways for us to discover what these other perceptions could possibly be for ourselves. The movie kept my attention with neat easy to understand imagery and interesting points of views from different walks of life such as author Miguel Ruiz, or quantum physicist, Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, and even lunar astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell just to name a few.

3147289,3,B0015SBNCA,"I love Don Miguel, Fred and Edgar but unfortunately, the females on this DVD offset the scientific data by perpetuating those worn-out memes based on mythology, mysticism and the occult. Too bad the MEN couldn't have launched a production on their own, by themselves, without all that contradictory stuff. Why are people afraid to let go of the past and embrace what quantum particle physics can teach us? There are some golden nuggets in this film that I will attempt to edit out so I can save them and replay them because they are valid and valuable information that needs to be shared but without all that other mystical nonsense.",1263081600,2,633,4.763636363636364

buy the DVD. It has bad editing, the computer graphics look like they were made by me!, the order of the ideas are all over the place, it's not
well written or organized. At the beginning it looks like a cheap commercial for the Moore Institute. I thought that by paying $25 for this DVD
I was taking home another ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" but I ended up taking home a ""glorified brochure"" safe your money and time and do not
purchase this one.
The past life and out of body experience sections were introduced without deep explanation, just as a fact that happened to one of the speakers (waking up
in somebody else's body and going to pee, really tasteless...they didn't do more interviews about this subject so maybe they could get another interviewee with a better story than that awkward experience or at least someone with a more philosophical approach.
The only speaker that had important information was given by Fred Alan Wolf.

This movie is a poorly directed, poorly edited conglomeration, or cluster, of disjointed ideas portrayed by over edited interviews. There were a lot of ideas that sounded like they could be interesting, but none of them ever really went into any depth and the transitions between ideas were almost non-existent.",1254096000,9,1404,4.661290322580645
3147291,5,B0015SBNCA,"I ordered this movie on Amazon and really enjoyed the thought provoking 1.5 hrs spent watching it. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with the people talking about their past lives. Because of their past life regressions at the Monroe Institute, they were able to recall some of their lives.

One interviewee, I think her name was Eden, actually started to get teary-eyed when she told the audience about her life in Japan at the end of WW2 when she and her newborn baby were forced to jump into the ocean in the nuclear firestorms. She uncomfortably told us that she died by drowning in that lifetime. I found all the story's credible except maybe one. A young man said he remembered one lifetime as a whale. He recalled how he was hunted and killed with harpoons. I only say his story wasn't credible to me because of a personal feeling I have that human souls and animal souls have different spiritual destiny pathways. But hey, none of us have all the answers and who am I to question this guys past life regression?

I also enjoyed how they did the simple but effective reenactments of people passing over to the other side and how they are greeted by their relatives or spirit guides. Also discussed and shown is the loving guidance of the Council of Elders in helping souls get ready for the next incarnation.

If you have an open mind and aren't too caught up in the need for scientific proof or religous dogma, you might very well like this production.",1252972800,8,1464,4.580152671755725
3147292,2,B0015SBNCA,"I bought this DVD because there was reference to Monroe Institute. I read Robert Allan Monroe's Book ""Journeys Out of the Body"" in 1993. Two years before his death. And I thought I'll see his interviews on this DVD and his personal experience. Instead this I saw Bhagavad-Gita fans like Don Ruiz and Fred Wolf who do not look like they understand elementary physics asseverating their theory based on Hindu theology. In uncut scenes Don Ruiz explained that there is not space between atoms that everything filled up with light. What the light god for sake is he talking about?! I bet he has no clue himself if he proving this by telling :""if you throw rock in to the space you will see reflection because of this light..."" You gotta be kidding me mister!!! You'll see reflection if there is a source of visual specter of light and this rock will be in zone of illumination otherwise you'll never see when it will fall back on your head. Fred Alan Wolf's statements did not look credible especially after uncut scene where he looked like religions comedian. Edgar Mithcell build his thoughts not on a scientific proof also. At least he never supported theory of non locality by any experiments. I expected that Laure Monroe would talk more about ""out of body technique"" and her father personal experience. I liked Eden James regression hypnosis stories. It sounded like from science fiction about that she was from Sirius and never being incarnated on Earth. I almost started enjoy her stories when it looked like she lost the balance trying to protect her stories saying that she is not crazy and uncut scene were cut. In other uncut scene there was phone ringing and some one walked right in the front interviewed person answered phone call and walked same way back. It was absolutely unprofessional from creators of this DVD. DVD does not have enough animation and more then that real facts which would make you believe at least in  some stuff they talking about. All ideas through whole movie like an introduction to general idea that there is life after death what is everyone knows already just does not believe enough in it. And this movie do not deliver this believe. There is a good conception in the movie that they look at the God not like monkeys on the human but at global system, however as I said they do not bring any proof to their thoughts and theories. Bringing in the front word quantum mechanic without experimental proof is not strengthening up their theory. And it definitely does not cost 20 dollars. In two words this movie is just like introduction to spiritualism without any scientific or other people experiences proof.",1250640000,7,2647,4.729437229437229

3147296,2,B0015SBNCA,"I was hoping for a documentary relating the latest discoveries in Quantum Physics to Spirituality. Instead, the bulk of this DVD is spent on people recalling alleged past life experiences, and no evidence at all is given to substantiate these claims. The producers are apparently die hard fundamentalists when it comes to reincarnation and don't feel that any research is needed to evaluate and assess validity of such claims. Speaking objectively and impartially, it is well known and documented that the mind will happily create any sort of fantasy including such things as false memories and UFO abductions, so these need to be handled with great caution. At one point in the DVD, Edgar Mitchell even alludes to the fact that such claims may be due to people tuning into the 'Field' rather than being actual experiences.
In sum, those who are looking for objective exploration of how the latest scientific discoveries can relate to spirituality are likely to find this DVD to be very disappointing and far below expectations.",1231718400,7,1028,5.052941176470588

For me, it was a strong reminder not to be attached to the birth and death forms that are prevalent in our teachings. It is an overwhelming thought for many that we are creating our world moment by moment.

3381780,1,B0015SBNCA,this movie was very boring and had few facts! more about some spirit space family than about quantum physics! very disappointing! i shut it off 30 minutes into it. Don't waste your time,1265500800,6,185,4.636363636363637
3381781,5,B0015SBNCA,"Great film. This film does not claim to be proof for reincarnation, OBE's, past lives or life after death but it does a great job in telling the viewer that something more than we can perceive is happening and their are ways for us to discover what these other perceptions could possibly be for ourselves. The movie kept my attention with neat easy to understand imagery and interesting points of views from different walks of life such as author Miguel Ruiz, or quantum physicist, Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, and even lunar astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell just to name a few. This video has a long shelf life as you can see by so few people attempting to sale used DVDs.",1265414400,13,660,4.508333333333334

3381783,5,B0015SBNCA,"This movie was an unexpected delight. There were a few parts of the movie that where off the beaten path, and that was refreshing. The path to enlightenment is a personal one, and can only be truly experienced alone; funny thing is once experienced alone becomes allone. If you are a fan of The Secret and the What The Bleep Do We Know series you are sure to love Spirit Space - it truly is a journey into your consciousness. Fred Alan Wolf is sure to please he's always so vibrant and it was nice seeing Don Miguel Ruiz, (The Four Agreements) again it's been years.

3381786,3,B0015SBNCA,"I love Don Miguel, Fred and Edgar but unfortunately, the females on this DVD offset the scientific data by perpetuating those worn-out memes based on mythology, mysticism and the occult. Too bad the MEN couldn't have launched a production on their own, by themselves, without all that contradictory stuff. Why are people afraid to let go of the past and embrace what quantum particle physics can teach us? There are some golden nuggets in this film that I will attempt to edit out so I can save them and replay them because they are valid and valuable information that needs to be shared but without all that other mystical nonsense.",1263081600,2,633,4.763636363636364
3381787,1,B0015SBNCA,"If you are planning to purchase this DvD to find answers to the questions about why we are here or where we're coming from and so on... stop and do not
buy the DVD. It has bad editing, the computer graphics look like they were made by me!, the order of the ideas are all over the place, it's not
well written or organized. At the beginning it looks like a cheap commercial for the Moore Institute. I thought that by paying $25 for this DVD
I was taking home another ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" but I ended up taking home a ""glorified brochure"" safe your money and time and do not
purchase this one.
The past life and out of body experience sections were introduced without deep explanation, just as a fact that happened to one of the speakers (waking up
in somebody else's body and going to pee, really tasteless...they didn't do more interviews about this subject so maybe they could get another interviewee with a better story than that awkward experience or at least someone with a more philosophical approach.
The only speaker that had important information was given by Fred Alan Wolf.

This movie is a poorly directed, poorly edited conglomeration, or cluster, of disjointed ideas portrayed by over edited interviews. There were a lot of ideas that sounded like they could be interesting, but none of them ever really went into any depth and the transitions between ideas were almost non-existent.",1254096000,9,1404,4.661290322580645
3381788,5,B0015SBNCA,"I ordered this movie on Amazon and really enjoyed the thought provoking 1.5 hrs spent watching it. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with the people talking about their past lives. Because of their past life regressions at the Monroe Institute, they were able to recall some of their lives.

One interviewee, I think her name was Eden, actually started to get teary-eyed when she told the audience about her life in Japan at the end of WW2 when she and her newborn baby were forced to jump into the ocean in the nuclear firestorms. She uncomfortably told us that she died by drowning in that lifetime. I found all the story's credible except maybe one. A young man said he remembered one lifetime as a whale. He recalled how he was hunted and killed with harpoons. I only say his story wasn't credible to me because of a personal feeling I have that human souls and animal souls have different spiritual destiny pathways. But hey, none of us have all the answers and who am I to question this guys past life regression?

I also enjoyed how they did the simple but effective reenactments of people passing over to the other side and how they are greeted by their relatives or spirit guides. Also discussed and shown is the loving guidance of the Council of Elders in helping souls get ready for the next incarnation.

If you have an open mind and aren't too caught up in the need for scientific proof or religous dogma, you might very well like this production.",1252972800,8,1464,4.580152671755725
3381789,2,B0015SBNCA,"I bought this DVD because there was reference to Monroe Institute. I read Robert Allan Monroe's Book ""Journeys Out of the Body"" in 1993. Two years before his death. And I thought I'll see his interviews on this DVD and his personal experience. Instead this I saw Bhagavad-Gita fans like Don Ruiz and Fred Wolf who do not look like they understand elementary physics asseverating their theory based on Hindu theology. In uncut scenes Don Ruiz explained that there is not space between atoms that everything filled up with light. What the light god for sake is he talking about?! I bet he has no clue himself if he proving this by telling :""if you throw rock in to the space you will see reflection because of this light..."" You gotta be kidding me mister!!! You'll see reflection if there is a source of visual specter of light and this rock will be in zone of illumination otherwise you'll never see when it will fall back on your head. Fred Alan Wolf's statements did not look credible especially after uncut scene where he looked like religions comedian. Edgar Mithcell build his thoughts not on a scientific proof also. At least he never supported theory of non locality by any experiments. I expected that Laure Monroe would talk more about ""out of body technique"" and her father personal experience. I liked Eden James regression hypnosis stories. It sounded like from science fiction about that she was from Sirius and never being incarnated on Earth. I almost started enjoy her stories when it looked like she lost the balance trying to protect her stories saying that she is not crazy and uncut scene were cut. In other uncut scene there was phone ringing and some one walked right in the front interviewed person answered phone call and walked same way back. It was absolutely unprofessional from creators of this DVD. DVD does not have enough animation and more then that real facts which would make you believe at least in  some stuff they talking about. All ideas through whole movie like an introduction to general idea that there is life after death what is everyone knows already just does not believe enough in it. And this movie do not deliver this believe. There is a good conception in the movie that they look at the God not like monkeys on the human but at global system, however as I said they do not bring any proof to their thoughts and theories. Bringing in the front word quantum mechanic without experimental proof is not strengthening up their theory. And it definitely does not cost 20 dollars. In two words this movie is just like introduction to spiritualism without any scientific or other people experiences proof.",1250640000,7,2647,4.729437229437229

3381793,2,B0015SBNCA,"I was hoping for a documentary relating the latest discoveries in Quantum Physics to Spirituality. Instead, the bulk of this DVD is spent on people recalling alleged past life experiences, and no evidence at all is given to substantiate these claims. The producers are apparently die hard fundamentalists when it comes to reincarnation and don't feel that any research is needed to evaluate and assess validity of such claims. Speaking objectively and impartially, it is well known and documented that the mind will happily create any sort of fantasy including such things as false memories and UFO abductions, so these need to be handled with great caution. At one point in the DVD, Edgar Mitchell even alludes to the fact that such claims may be due to people tuning into the 'Field' rather than being actual experiences.
In sum, those who are looking for objective exploration of how the latest scientific discoveries can relate to spirituality are likely to find this DVD to be very disappointing and far below expectations.",1231718400,7,1028,5.052941176470588
3381794,5,B0015SBNCA,"""Spirit Space: A Journey Into Your Consciousness"" is a wonderful reminder for everyone no matter where one is in one's journey. It like other's of its kind can be watched over and over again as one proceeds and grows. For me, it was a strong reminder not to be attached to the birth and death forms that are prevalent in our teachings. It is an overwhelming thought for many that we are creating our world moment by moment. As a member of the seniors in the USA, I find this idea extremely exciting and I am thrilled by my choice to be here at this time. Thank you for making this film and thank you for making it available to everyone. Namasthe.

8259820,3,B0015SBNCA,"Spirit Space is a film that uses complex terminology to try to convince us that there really is life beyond death. I enjoyed it the first time I watched it, but, to be fair, that was also the period in my life when I believed that chiropractic adjustments were actually realigning my spinal energy and that Applied Kinesiology was a legitimate form of medical diagnostic testing.

This film really stretches the imagination, making claims that people have experienced past lives through deep hypnosis, have floated outside of their bodies at will, and have died and come back from the dead with tales to tell of the loved ones that were waiting for them. Since I am in agreement with the philosophy that we really do not know what happens to us after death, I took all of this with a grain of salt on my most recent viewing. I'm honestly not sure what to make of this amalgam of tales from obviously VERY passionate individuals. I do know, however, that I am highly skeptical of anyone who claims to have had an out-of-body experience, as at least one study has shown that the room seen by the ""floating"" dead individual is not the same room as the one that they died in. This does not invalidate the claims of these individuals, it just leads me to question them.

I recommend Spirit Space to anyone who is interested in what lies beyond our current state of consciousness. That will probably be all of you who are reading this review. It's really worth a look, even if it was made on a cheap budget (some of the computer model representations were lacking in refinement) and is about a subject we will never know the answer to until we actually do die.
