8135032,5,B000GYB3ME,"This has been on my want list for a good while now.  Back n the late 80s/early 90s a band called Vengeance Rising made a positive impact on many young thrash kids.  I was one of them. The original line up minus Roger Martinez got together for a comeback show. Since they could not legally use the Vengeace Rising name, because of Roger Martinez having the rights. So they perform under the name Once Dead with Scott Waters of Ultimatum on vocals. They all do a tremendous job rehashing all the old classic from the first 2 VR albums. The extras, and the interviews almost got me in tears.",1405296000,,588,4.385321100917431
8135033,4,B000GYB3ME,"This DVD is a great pick up for any fan. Sure it's not a big budget production, but the quality is still very good. This DVD is your best option to seeing classic Vengeance songs played by all the original players. Scott Waters did a good job of filling in for Roger Martinez. He wasn't Roger but in some ways I think he was better. Check it out for yourself. If you're really a fan I doubt you will be disappointed.",1203292800,4,416,4.148148148148148
8135034,4,B000GYB3ME,"These guys are just as tight on stage, as they were in the STUDIO, 15 YEARS ago.  During some parts if you close your eyes it's as if you are listening to the original recordings.  Scott's voice though, would not be confused with Roger's.  Not talentwise, he's just got a different quality to his voice.  The sound is decent and the video is quite good especially considering the size of the venue.  The interview also is informative and candid.",1194134400,4,445,4.582278481012659
8135035,1,B000GYB3ME,"I was excited to hear that the band was getting back to record a show.  I finally tracked down the dvd and I wasn't too impressed with the sound.  There were planety of mistakes, but that can be forgiven on the fact that teh group hadn't been together that long.  I was wanting more from the singer.  He didn't seem to have the vocals for the type of music.  Its good to have for the die hard Vengenace fans though.  The interview is pretty cool.",1160438400,4,446,4.188235294117647
