8689035,4,B00PR2MQW6,"Amanda is another of the many gifted water color artists from down under.  I would have given this DVD a 5 star if it weren't for the fact that so much of what she says as she paints is nearly indiscernible.  This is due to the high winds that prevail over most of the film plus the fact that she simply mumbles (as if to herself) for much of the work.  Still, watch this film over and over and pay particular attention to how she mixes color and how she applies it.  It's what she does, far more than what she's saying that makes this a good instructional DVD.  Hers is more a slap-dash approach, but in the end her control of tonal values results in a pleasant end product.",1448409600,2,675,4.161538461538462
