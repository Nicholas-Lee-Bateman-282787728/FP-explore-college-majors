7893238,4,6305701482,"Volume 17 in the series of the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series contain some of the better episodes from the series. Not quite classics from the show but these are still some well made, well acted programs.

 ""What You Need"" starts things out with a peddler who is very good at his job. He is able to predict the future and know what a person will need and sell it to them just seconds before that person finds they really do need that item. Fate brings the peddler in contact with a small time gangster who then uses the peddlers power for his own selfish gains. What will the peddler do?

 ""What's in the Box"" stars three of the all time great actors of movies and television. A Taxi driver, played by William Damarest (best known for playing Uncle Charlie on ""My Three Sons"") likes to be able to relax after a hard day of work by coming home having a beer and watching his TV. The TV is broken however and a TV repairman, played by Sterling Holloway, fixes it. Problem is the TV is now showing how the taxi driver has been cheating on his wife, played by Joan Blondell, with other women as well as showing what is going to happen in the future. It leads to the ""Twilight Zones"" version of reality TV.

 ""The Mirror"" stars Peter Falk, of ""Columbo"" fame, as a dictator who has just gained control of an unnamed Latin-American country. Falk himself looks a lot like Fidel Castro right down to the beard. The man he overthrew to take over the country offers Falk a present. A mirror that will help Falk see who his enemies are. Falk doesn't believe the overthrown ruler... at first but...

Last on the disc is  ""The Old Man in the Cave"" is one of those post apocalypse stories of a group of people who are able to survive with the help of a wise old man who lives in a cave. He tells them if food they found is safe to eat of if it is contaminated with radioactivity. No one in the town has actually seen the old man. Just one man in the group, played by John Anderson, has talked with the old man who passes on to the town what the old man tells him. one day a group of rogue military personal, whose leader is played by James Coburn, comes into town to take things over. They are in charge now and they don't care about any old man in any cave. It leads to a confrontation that will change everything.

All together these are decent episodes. Any fan of TZ will want to add this volume to their collection. For anyone not familiar with ""Twilight Zone"" this volume could make a good introduction to the series. I recommend it.",1402531200,,2520,4.266247379454927

7893240,5,6305701482,"THE MIRROR written by Rod Serling and directed by Don Medford is interesting stuff. Peter Falk is a revolutionary leader who uses a mirror to show the viewer the face of the person who will kill him. And so it goes.
You really have to love WHAT'S IN THE BOX. It is so frenetic and so over the top, but William Demerest, Joan Blondell and Sterling Holloway really make this one work. It's goofy and inane, but very watchable as cab driver, William Demerest, sees himself killing his wife, Joan Blondell, on their television set. It was written by Martin M. Goldsmith.
WHAT YOU NEED from the First Season was written by directed by John Brahm about someone being able to tell the future and an unscrupulous man taking advantage of that ability.
THE OLD MAN IN THE CAVE written by Rod Serling is most notable for James Coburn's over the top performance in this tale of survivors from a nuclear holocaust.",1380499200,,901,4.567901234567901

7893242,4,6305701482,"Volume 17 contains two stories that are better than average, and two below average stories.  WHAT YOU NEED features Ernest Truex (1889-1973), an adorable old man having the starring role in the magnificent Twilight Zone episode, KICK THE CAN.  In WHAT YOU NEED, Ernest Truex is a peddler.  He totes a box of knick knacks containing things such as matches, thread, a bus ticket, cleaning fluid, shoes, and scissors.  WHAT YOU NEED begins when the peddler enters a caf, approaches various customers, and selects a knick knack and gives it to the customer.  As it turns out, even though each item seems inconsequential, the item is found to be useful in the immediate future.  In other words, Ernest Truex has the ability to see the future, and to give any person an item that can serve the person's future needs.  To give an example, the peddler gives a man a pair of scissors.  Even though the man scoffs at this gift, he changes his mind in the next scene, when his scarf gets caught in the door of an elevator.  The various elements in WHAT YOU NEED fit together rather well.  FOUR STARS.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX concerns an elderly married couple.  The man is a taxi driver, who likes to have girl friends on the side.  The wife is a plump, brassy blond.  The initial issue is that their television set is broken.  The TV repairman is Sterling Holloway (voice of Winnie the Pooh, and Kaa the snake in The Jungle Book).  Sterling Holloway also stars in a black and white Superman T.V. episode about a computer, named Mr. Kelso, that plans crimes.

After the TV is ""fixed,"" the TV acquires the strange property of disclosing secrets and of predicting the future.  While the man (William Damarest) is relaxing with a can of beer in front of the TV, he notices that the screen shows him with one of his girlfriends.  William Damarest drops his beer in surprise.  Later on in the story, the screen shows him fighting with his wife, pushing her out the window, and then going to the electric chair.

The well-choreographed fight scene is amazing.  It is rare for any movie to show an elderly couple fighting with each other.  Here, they throw books, lamps, chairs, at each other. The aggression that the pair shows towards each other is so over-the-top, that it is funny (and much better than any Three Stooges episode).

William Damarest is so shocked by this depiction on his television that he faints.  When he revives, he decides to turn a new leaf, to express sorrow for his dilly-dallying, and to express his devotion to his wife.  But his attempts at expressing devotion backfire, and the film ends with a gargantuan ironic twist.  FIVE STARS.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX features Joan Blondell (1906-1979), who acted in 100 movies, including Sinner's Holiday (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), The Perfect Specimen, The Blue Veil (1951), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), Nightmare Alley (1947), Desk Set (1957), Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957) and The Cincinnati Kid (1965).

WHAT'S IN THE BOX also stars William Damarest (1892-1983), who acted in 140 films.  His films include, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938), Romance on the Run (1938), One Wild Night (1938), Josette (1938), Peck's Bad Boy with the Circus (1938), While New York Sleeps (1938), The Great Man Votes (1939), King of the Turf (1939), The Lady Eve (1941), Sullivan's Travels (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), On Our Merry Way (1948), Here Come the Girls (1953), Jupiter's Darling (1955), and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963).

THE MIRROR is a tedious story about a dictator in Central America and his henchmen.

THE OLD MAN IN THE CAVE is also tedious.  THE OLD MAN IN THE CAVE is one of Twilight Zone's stories about the apocalypse.  Generally, Twilight Zone's apocalypse stories are enormously tedious, for example, ONE MORE PALLBEARER and TWO (with Charles Bronson).  A notable exception is TIME ENOUGH AT LAST (with Burgess Meredith), which is one of the very best in the Twilight Zone series.",1205193600,3,3977,4.7562043795620434
