8138976,5,B000HDTD26,"Breathtaking storm footage taken by three experienced storm chasers/ videographers who were there to capture Katrina at the height of her fury.  Luckily, they all survived to bring us this film.  It is frightening in its simple presentation of the event as it occurred.  No hype needed.  Excellent.",1420156800,,298,5.145833333333333
