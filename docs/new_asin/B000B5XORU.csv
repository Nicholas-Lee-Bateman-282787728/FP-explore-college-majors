2400354,5,B000B5XORU,"I remember watching Harold Lloyd as a kid. When I came across these DVDs I had to try at least one. The DVD and reproduction quality are excellent, I'm very pleased at with buy. As a kid I remember Harold Lloyd being funny but now that I'm an adult I can really appreciate the genious and humor even more. A great DVD - I can't wait to buy the rest of the set.",1161820800,4,360,3.9452054794520546
2400355,5,B000B5XORU,"Harold Lloyd was a top star in his day; and for good reason.

Harold's ""Kid Brother"" and ""The Freshman"" are in this volume-2. They are very funny, entertaining, clever, and well worth seeing.

Harold's films have a girl he is trying to win, bullies, chases, and clever humor. The ""Kid Brother"", in the old west, has the youngest brother outsmarting his bully, older brothers. ""The Freshman"" is the perils of a freshman college student falling prey to some clever pranks of the upperclassmen.

These silent-films are not movies with just music; they are planned so you understand the action, just by watching, at a good pace. A lost art. I did not care for Harold's later talking-pictures.

Harold was funny, when chased by bullies, as Harold was short, skinny, had straw-hat and glasses, looking unathletic. So convincing, film critics today still believe him frail. However, Harold was very able, he was very quick, nimble, balanced, and had unusually strong, climbing strength; getting him away from those bullies just in time.

Harold's ""Safety Last"" is his best. (In the other volume-1, or in the 3-volume-set). I recommend volume-1 first, then volume-2, or the 3-volume-set. Volume-3 has ""Speedy"", which is funny, but not as good as the these others, ""Speedy"" does show Coney Island amusement park rides in the 1920's, a scene with Babe Ruth, and volume-3 has a 15-minute extra of Harold's palatial estate.",1155945600,12,1411,5.03862660944206
2400356,5,B000B5XORU,"This collection has more prime cuts from the TRUE king of silent comedy (Sorry Charlie!).

We have here an interesting collection of our man's varying personas. The everyman go-getter (Dr. Jack & Feet First) and the geek who overcomes (Grandma's Boy, The Freshamn, and the Kid Brother).

In DR. JACK (with cameos from the Our Gang kids), our hero is a likeable commonsense country doctor who tries to foil the plans of a quack to exploit a rich family. GRANDMA'S BOY is the foundation of Harold's geek tales. Here, he's a pitiful coward whose Grandma encourages him to have guts and fight a persistant bully and the tramp who terrorizes the town. THE FRESHMAN has Harold as the White Steve Urkel. This pathetic nerd goes to college and goes up to people with a stupid dance and says ""step right up and call me speedy."" He becomes the school joke, but see what happens. It's a great story about being yourself, as is THE KID BROTHER, another geek vs. bullies tale distiguished by some really heartwarming moments and a hilarious scene with a monkey.

However, things go south with the early talkie FEET FIRST, with Harold as an ambitious shoe salesman. Like most early sound films, it's wooden and unfunny (except for Harold's ridiculous pontificating speech about shoes ""Without shoes, we'd all be- BAREFOOT!"" delivered with gusto). You'll skip a number of chapters on this one! The film goes on with a sound remake of the ""human fly"" scene from SAFETY LAST, marred by some Stepin Fetchit stereotype antics by Willie ""Sleep & Eat"" Best (Harold, who is usually nice to Blacks and other ethnic groups in his films refers to Best as ""Charcoal!"" Fortuantely, this was a rare exception for this usually likeable character).

With that said, go for it.",1152316800,3,1746,4.790697674418604
2400357,5,B000B5XORU,"The films need no recommendation from me; Lloyd was a great entertainer, and though Chaplin and Keaton (especially) were deeper and more poetic, Lloyd's films still work. But the packaging and publicity make it all but impossible to find out who wrote the scores, and that's criminal. In this issue the great Carl Davis scored ""The Kid Brother"" and ""The Freshman,"" and the other orchestral scores are by Robert Israel. (Davis scored ""High and Dizzy"" but it's Israel's work on the DVD.) Now you know.",1395014400,,499,4.882352941176471
2400358,5,B000B5XORU,"The collection is great; but, for me, at least, THE FRESHMAN is worth the whole thing.  A great great comedy.  Personally one of my ten favorite film comedies.  See it; that's an order!!!",1390003200,,187,4.606060606060606
2400359,5,B000B5XORU,"Lloyd was a great comedian.  His character was more of a regular person than the screen characters of either Chaplin or Keaton.  Like Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd utilized his acrobatic abilities to enhance his comic situations. Earnest, well-meaning, innocent, and determined are terms which describe the glasses character of Lloyd.  His films are fun and enjoyable.",1379635200,,364,5.464285714285714
2400360,5,B000B5XORU,"I'm quite interested in the lovely, angelically sweet, and sadly now forgotten Jobyna Ralston, who played the romantic interest in several of Harold Lloyd's films including the two films listed in the title above.

The chemistry these two had together is the cutest and most heart-warming thing you ever saw! The tree-climbing scene in The Kid Brother is one of the sweetest and most romantic things I know of in movie history! Wow, I'm gushing! I don't normally gush in reviewing a movie, but honestly I wanted to be her in that scene. I would just melt if a guy did that for me. Sigh.

OK, that's enough of that! According to the audio commentary you can turn on if you want, Lloyd took steps to protect his negatives, which partly accounts for the high quality of the more ambitious movies. If you count the back of the second disk as a third disk, this is a three-disk set that includes some of Lloyd's other work such as Bumping into Broadway, Billy Blazes, Esq, Dr Jack, Feet First, Grandma's Boy, Now or Never, and High and Dry.",1377216000,,1035,4.529411764705882
2400361,5,B000B5XORU,I watched these with my 15 year old son and we laughed so hard!  It's nice to watch something with a teen that doesn't have any bad language or references and is genuinely funny!,1373155200,,178,4.235294117647059
2400362,4,B000B5XORU,"How strong Harold Lloyd is to perform with apparent ease he physical feats of his bumbling adventures, His little dance he does in thr Freshman is hilarious.",1357430400,,157,4.851851851851852
2400363,4,B000B5XORU,"I have not looked at all the Harold Lloyd films yet, so i cannot assess the overall fims -- but the product came on time with exactly the material as advertised. The few I have seen makes me understand why Lloyd was ""bigger"" than Chaplin in some ways.",1355097600,,251,4.25
2400364,5,B000B5XORU,Harold Lloyd was a very funny man.  He was talented and earned every dollar he made - 15 million during his career.  I would think anyone who enjoys comedy would love this Collection.,1353801600,,183,4.515151515151516
2400365,5,B000B5XORU,"We ""found"" Harold Lloyd films on TMC when they were have a Harold Lloyd day.  I have never been a silent movie fan, but this guy was so funny we watched several.  I had to have the one talkie, ""Feet First"".  Harold Lloyd is a funny guy and pretty athletic to do the stunts he did.
Him being stuck on a scaffolding going up and down a building was hilarious.",1267142400,3,357,4.071428571428571
2400366,5,B000B5XORU,"There was a wonderful surprise when I watched the Comedy Collection.  Jobyna Ralston.  She is in 7 of the masterpieces we get to see.  She interacts with Lloyd as a classic, beautiful setting enhances an exquisite jewel. The chemistry they generate together is a major reason why these 7 movies she did are still as good as they were when they were made so long ago and far away.",1260576000,6,379,4.463768115942029
