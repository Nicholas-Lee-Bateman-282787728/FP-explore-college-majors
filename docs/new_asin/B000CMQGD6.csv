8099235,5,B000CMQGD6,"Absolutely loved it!!  Brought back fond memories of watching these shows when I was young, and enjoying it even more now.  Perry Como had such a great voice and you can just see the the feeling in his face and hear it in his voice when he sings the old carols about the birth of Jesus.

You simply cannot get quality shows like this these days on tv, so am so happy I was able to purchase this.",1483056000,,395,4.038461538461538

8099237,5,B000CMQGD6,"Christmas Around the World with Perry Como is my favorite Christmas video. I hope it is now also available on DVD. Viewers are taken through Christmas traditions celebrated in six different cultures, including Colonial Williamsburg; Paris, France; Montreal Canada; Mexico City, Mexico; Vienna, Austria; and the Holy Land. All of these Christmas shows are fun and inspiring to experience.",1383004800,,387,5.576271186440678

8099241,5,B000CMQGD6,"This VHS Tape is the only compilation of Perry's Color Television Specials from the 1970's and 1980's. The sources appear to be Broadcast Masters of some form, but this is nevertheless unconfirmed.

The video features segments of Como Christmas Specials from Austria, Colonial Williamsburg, France, French Canada, Israel and Mexico.

Guest Stars include: Debbie Boone (Perry's God Child), Vicki Carr, Sid Caesar, Richard Chamberlain, Angie Dickinson and John Wayne.

It's surprising that this compilation has yet to be re-issued by Reader's Digest in a Digital format.

""Perry Como's Early American Christmas"" (from Colonial Williamsburg) and ""Perry Como's Christmas In The Holy Land"" (from Israel) are both available on VHS Tape; released by Haber Video. These VHS Tapes have also yet to be commercially released in a Digital format.

All 3 VHS Tapes represent very good value for money.",1155600000,13,888,5.405797101449275
8099242,5,B000CMQGD6,This video is truly a treasure. Perry takes you to different areas around the world and gives you a glimpse into their Christmas traditions. The two performances by the Vienna Boys Choir in Austria is worth the price of the video alone! While in Austria Perry takes you to the church where Silent Night was first performed and sings a verse in the same manner it was done that first night. In one special he is in Mexico with Toni Tenille and Vicki Carr and then he sings Ave Maria with a Mexican children's choir- their voices are so sweet. What a priceless performance!,1134000000,9,571,4.5
