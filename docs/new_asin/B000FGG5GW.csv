8122228,1,B000FGG5GW,"I think it's a little more than coincidence that all of the 4 and 5 star reviews here are either from Pennsylvania or don't show where they're from at all, considering this movie was filmed in Pennsylvania.  I'm a big supporter of independent, low-budget, and underground films.  I actually prefer them over any of the big-budget Hollywood films, but this was just unbelievably bad, bad, bad, sad to say.  The acting was atrocious.  The special effects were beyond laughable.  The ""actors"" just seemed to run around the sets, oblivious to any direction.  The film makers obviously did not put their hearts into this film.  No one even seemed to be TRYING to make a good film.  Even in bad films, you can tell if the film makers put everything they've got into it.  In this film, it was just the opposite.  There seemed to be no direction at all, and absolutely no passion.  Besides being a blatant rip-off of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies, there was absolutely no attempt at originality.  The only good thing I can say about this film is that the sets and locations were great, (Hence, the 1 star).  It's just sad that they weren't utilized in a creative way.  This film was just an excuse to rip off women's shirts, expose their breasts, and rub VERY fake looking blood on them in the hopes of titillating viewers .  If that turns you on, then go for it, but don't expect anything more here, because there is nothing more.  Pathetic, to say the least.",1233964800,5,1459,4.596899224806202
8122229,1,B000FGG5GW,"I really didn't know what i was expecting from this movie but, what i got sure wasen't it. Just a sad no budget flick",1233878400,,117,3.9166666666666665
8122230,1,B000FGG5GW,"Don't buy this unless you want a real good laugh (both at yourself for buying it and at the people who made it).  This movie gives new meaning to the phrase ""low-budget horror flick"".",1220659200,,183,4.382352941176471
8122231,1,B000FGG5GW,"Terrible acting, terrible direction, NO STORY!!! - Some of the worst effects ever. Don't trust other reviews, the other reviews are by the people who made the movie.",1168128000,2,165,4.928571428571429
8122232,5,B000FGG5GW,"First of all forget about that crap that is out called ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The beginning"" Cause this is the real deal. If you want to see Naked girls, gore and total chaos than this is it. From the first frame to the end this move delivers what the big studios are scared of. My soft spot was the delicous scenbe with the well endowed Syn Devil.

From the erie settings in the backwoods of Pennsylvania this movie is well above any underground flick out there. The movie has a tight script,great music,excellent script an plenty of gore.

Hollywood better get ready cause Ryan Cavalinne is coming! Lets just hope Ryan and the crew keeps doing what they do best...scaring the hell out of us!!!!!!",1160784000,3,701,4.6
8122233,5,B000FGG5GW,This movie is quite disturbing when you watch it. Even though you can tell its low-budget you still get that creepy feeling that you sometimes never get when watching a big-budget hollywood horror film. Its good to know that 4th Floor Pictures still knows what horror really is.,1160611200,3,278,4.8125
8122234,4,B000FGG5GW,"House of Carnage from 4th Floor Pictures. What a great surprise? It is a great blend of the classic horror films we grew up with from the 70's. The style the film was shot was as if you yourself we're there. If you are a fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen,and Friday the 13th. Then this is a movie for you. It has suspense build up,and heart pounding action these movies need. The script is strong and flows throughout the whole  movie. Plenty of blood,gore and nudity throughout. To keep you in your seat till the end. The acting was surprisingly good for a B indie film. The locations themselves were eerie and creepy alone. If your looking for a flick to give you the chills and make you look behind you after your done watching it. Then this is a highly recommended indie film to buy. With great killing characters, and alot of screaming girls. You will not be disappointed in it. So turn out the lights and lock all the doors. Cause Pluto and J.R. Sorg are going to get you tonight.",1160611200,4,997,4.360215053763441
8122235,5,B000FGG5GW,"House Of Carnage is the latest scare-o-rama from the fine folks at 4th Floor Pictures. For those who seen it's predecessor,this film is the sequel to 2004's Day Of The Ax. It continues the exploits of J.R. Sorg and his family's murderous exploits. The film is presented like a grainy, gritty film, like it's predecessor. And like Day Of The Ax..there are sub-plots that keep the audience on edge instead of just mindless killing. Very well scripted, and laid out. There's enough suspense, action, blood, and, gore to shake a stick at. They don't make indie films like this nowadays..so do yourself a favor and pick this underground gem up! And if you like this flick, be on the look out for their other work as well!!!",1160611200,4,718,4.661417322834645
8122236,5,B000FGG5GW,"Wow! Very surprised by this little gem of a find.  I took a chance on this one and it paid off.  Sure, there's a lot of Texas Chainsaw Massacre influence here, but it has it's own direction and flavor.  A little supernatural twist thrown in the mix and this flick made my night.  There's a lot of b-movies out there to sift throught but very few deliver.  This one does and it does it in spades.  Do yourself a favor, avoid the crap and pick this one up.  If you love horror, then you won't regret it.  4th Floor has returned with another fulfilling escapism into unnerving entertainment.",1159401600,3,588,4.37962962962963
8122237,5,B000FGG5GW,"if you dig movies like the Texas Chainsaw Masscre and the Devil's Rejects then you'll dig this little indie flick.  It's full of blood, violence, and nudity.  Pretty cool for a low budget flick.  Check it out.",1155513600,3,209,4.594594594594595
