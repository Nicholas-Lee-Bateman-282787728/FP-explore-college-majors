8317823,5,B001LEHTCG,"If you want to get into Dragon Gate USA this is the DVD you want to get. A nice introduction to an amazing product, Hours of action. No dull moments here. An amazing DVD to say the lease!!",1277769600,,188,3.973684210526316
8317824,4,B001LEHTCG,"Dragon Gate is one of the fastest growing wrestling promotions in the world. It's fast pace and high flying style is what sets it apart from other promotions. This DVD features matches from several shows in 2006. While I don't think these are the ""best"" matches the promotion has had, it's definitely worth the price and it's a must own for fans. The matches all took place in Japan, but there is english commentary. If you are a fan of high flying, high octane, fast pace junior heavyweight wrestling, then do yourself a favor and pick this up.",1270512000,,545,4.571428571428571
8317825,5,B001LEHTCG,"This is by far one of the best wrestling DVDs of all time.  The matches are very fast-paced and exciting.  You never know what is going to happen next.  I have no complaints about this DVD at all.  The ""hair vs. hair"" match was pretty funny.  It is also great to see Japanese legend Jushin Thunder Liger.  He has always been my favorite Japanese wrestler.  It is also great to see Matt Sydal (WWE's Evan Bourne).  It's too bad that WWE is pretty much making him a jobber (that's my own opinion).  If you want fast-paced, high-flying action, then buy this DVD.  It is definitely a must have!!!",1267747200,2,592,4.398148148148148
8317826,5,B001LEHTCG,"This show is very solid, great matches much better than what you will see in TNA or even WWE. On this DVD there are some matches without commentary but you can hear the crown reaction. It's a must buy for any indy wrestling fan.",1263168000,,228,4.204545454545454
