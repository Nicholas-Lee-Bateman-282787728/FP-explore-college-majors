8372834,5,B002LFPBJ2,"The movie at times has the feel of many loosely related rough clips put together, however, that seems appropriate for a movie about a grass roots organization. It also feels sincere and no BS which is a welcome change from some documentaries that have such a propagandist edge that the truth gets lost in the effort to support the theme. It's personal enough that you can understand the motivations of the people interviewed. I very much enjoyed watching democracy in action.",1359849600,,475,4.8765432098765435
