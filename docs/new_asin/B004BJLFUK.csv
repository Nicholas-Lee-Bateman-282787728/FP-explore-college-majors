4319123,5,B004BJLFUK,"A fresh look into the life and work of this controversial personality. The film avoided too much verbosity and sensationalism. Somehow I felt there was a sense of measure, some unspoken rule of a documentary director. Burroughs'  connections to musicians, poets and other cultural icons was most telling and informative. Definitely worth watching!",1352937600,3,347,5.547169811320755
4319124,5,B004BJLFUK,"This documentary definitely focuses on Burrough's sexuality more than any other I've seen, with chat about who he had crushes on & who had crushes on him. And I know plenty who found that objectionable, as who cares if he was gay, he's a true original and icon as a writer. But frankly, that concern is really just a wincing knee-jerk homophobia from the very non-gay audience Burroughs was generally interested in writing for. As in truth, he more than most really WAS more deeply influenced by his sexuality in the formation of the whats & whys of all he wrote.

Being an 'outcast' concerned with 'otherness' (ie, NOT the straight & narrow path) and an interest in 'marginalized' beinghood (even 'alien') & unusual sexual practices IS ALL BURROUGHS...the man within, you might say. And yes, resultant of having no represented place in society growing up, and for him, well into adulthood. Find me one song on the radio that sings of same sex love (no, not 'Lola' by The Kinks), and maybe you can refute that, even today, the stigmas are strong. But he turned stigmatization into an artform. Or you might say, he took his poison & transformed it into the body of work we've now gained from him.

In any case, I've seen a lot of Burroughs, including the Commissioner of Sewers & Towers Open Fire, as well as owning some of his talkie CDs like Dead City Radio, and sure this film borrows plenty of footage from these, which 'real fans' would have already had exposure to. But I take it real fans don't mind seeing clips of those again & actually enjoy it quite a bit. I think this was a very cool documentary with some personal tidbits, both from stories told & home videos shown, which were quite rewarding.",1328054400,11,1707,4.593442622950819
4319125,4,B004BJLFUK,"A good film, well worth seeing if you have any real interest in WSB. The film does a good job at rebalancing some aspects of his life that he is perhaps more notorious for (his drug use for example). There's a lot of deserved respect here. And we do learn quite a bit about WSB.

It's a shame that there's not more archive footage of Bill himself telling his story (who really cares what Jello Biafra thinks?) but then it's a shame Bill is no longer around (though that would be pushing it). There was a BBC Horizon documentary in the mid or late 80s, which was almost entirely Bill himself, telling his story, fantastic stuff: --- some of that could have been good to include.

Having said that, there are still many great (new to me) clips of Bill in this film, and yes this is definitely a film worth seeing.",1318896000,7,811,4.328947368421052
4319126,4,B004BJLFUK,"Previously unseen archival footage enhances this probing but affectionate look at William S. Burroughs (""Naked Lunch""), one of the first writers to break the social barriers of queer and drug culture.  Burroughs thrashed conservative values and triggered counterculture movements.  The soundtrack is by Patti Smith and Sonic Youth.  Peter Weller narrates with a bemused detachment.  This sharp documentary delves below the surface of a troubled, brilliant and desperately sane author whose influence remains a force.",1299715200,13,516,5.84
4319127,5,B004BJLFUK,"I've only seen a couple of clips from this documentary, but it looks very interesting and I can't wait to watch the DVD. I've heard a lot about William S. Burroughs, but it will be telling to listen to some of people that knew and worked with him. Frankly, I will be ordering the DVD based on my past experience with Oscilloscope titles, such as ""Howl"" and ""Exit through the Gift Shop"".

4319136,1,B004BJLFUK,"Burroughs would probably have hated this film.
I think it makes him look like a 'lost', 'soft', 'homosexual' 'alien', and not a writer; who he was in total.
I don't know why there was a hugely disproportionate amount of his personal life portrayed over far more important issued such as his writing? His important work? The BBC documentary was much better.

It's unfortunate this was the most popular film made about the man, an with what could have been with all the access they had, because it seems to have no grasp on any of his most powerful ideas... it's just a series of anecdotes, and usually irrelevant ones.

It's a blinkered adaptation of his life in TOTAL (are you kidding?). I think it says more about the director, to drag a great dead writer into his own patch of limelight, than about William S. Burroughs, one of the greatest American Writers of the 20th century.

Watch the BBC documentary if you want to see a better documentary. Or else get his books, listen to his readings and lectures, read his favourite authors, like Denton Welch.",1382313600,11,1055,4.661290322580645
4319137,5,B004BJLFUK,"I really enjoyed ""A Man Within"".  I learned a great deal about William S. Burroughs that I had not known from just the reading of his books.  Iggy Pop and John Waters provided very interesting insights.  I recommend this movie to any fan of Burroughs.",1370131200,2,251,4.533333333333333
8421979,2,B004BJLFUK,"Good interviews and insights into the life and work of Burroughs. But really, a man is his deeds. No matter how good his poetry about the function of an anus was, I cannot respect someone who was a pedophile, a junkie, someone who shot their wife, etc. The man is of low worth; I don't care what his house boy has to say about him.",1510617600,2,331,4.107692307692307

8421981,3,B004BJLFUK," Ive read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Lunch/dp/0802122078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Lunch</a>. The year was 1967. I cant even use the excuse that I was a college sophomore. I was a junior. About half way through the book I literally walked over to the trash can, and threw the book in it. Then I thought about my rule of always finishing a book, no matter how bad, once I committed to read it. A rule Ive more or less maintained through my life. So, I went back, dusted off a stain or two, and finished it. Today, the only thing I remember about the book is the sexual act which Burroughs described that led me to throw it in the trash one that I still have not tried, all the way to today.

A fellow Amazon reviewer and I were discussing Burroughs on one of our hikes. He was the one who informed me that Burroughs killed his wife in Mexico in the early 50s, and walked away without consequences. A junkie, and the documentary says that he was the father of the Beat Generation. Soooo when Amazon Prime recommended this movie to me (for free!) I thought Id revisit that trash can.

William Burroughs was born in 1914, scion of a family that had made their fortune in adding machines, and would go on to rival IBM as a maker of mainframe computers. Burroughs graduated from Harvard. He was good friends with Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. He says that he never would have become a writer if he had not killed his wife, Joan. He killed her when they were playing William Tell, zonked out, with a .45 pistol. He published the book I retrieved from the trash can in 1959, and his friends, respectively, and subsequently, would publish&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Road/dp/0140283293/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Road</a>)\ and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-Original-Draft-Facsimile-Transcript-and-Variant-Versions-Fully-Annotated-by-Author-with-Contemporaneous-Correspondence-Account-of-First-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Classics/dp/0061137456/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript, and Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author, with Contemporaneous Correspondence, Account of First ...

After Mexico, he would settle in Tangiers (Morocco) in 1954. He was a heavy drug user, the whole pharmacopeia, with heroin being a favorite. He was also a pioneer of the gay liberation movement, and would prefer professional young hustlers. He romanticized drug use in his writings. And he rambled a lot. In the documentary, one of the interviewees called him the greatest American writer of the second half of the 20th Century. His son with Joan would die of acute alcoholism, at the age of 33, even after a liver transplant, having felt rejected by his father.

I was stunned to learn that the incredible Ms. Patti Smith, the singer, who had it together enough to attract and be good friends with the recently deceased playwright Sam Shepherd, loved Burroughs, and even considered marrying him. Remorse about killing Joan was not in evidence. The documentary showed that he continued to have an absolute fascination with guns, taking loaded guns to bed with his lovers. And this is the father of the Beat Generation?

How did he live so long, living as dangerously as he did? A good question raised in the documentary, and not really answered. He never got AIDS, and lived to a ripe old age, dying in 1997, shortly after one of his lovers had died, Allen Ginsberg. The narrator said that the reason why he never contracted AIDS was that as the senior member of the shoot-up circle, he was always first! What! And no mention of the young hustlers. And then there are all those loose guns laying around, and his obsession in playing with them.

The documentary concludes that he was a religious figure for those that do not fit in.  Unmentioned are the many other better examples of those who take the path less traveled, make a contribution, and have an ethical compass. Im glad I saw the documentary instead of re-reading Naked Lunch. Yet the documentary itself was also flawed, as indicated above about AIDS transmission, and certainly passed over lightly the killing of his wife. Overall, 3-stars for the documentary, much less for his life.",1506902400,4,4371,5.41764705882353

8421984,4,B004BJLFUK,"I thought ""WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS:  A MAN WITHIN"" expressed some powerful ideas about his life and work.  His thoughts were clouded yet always concise and his work as a writer, traveler and consumer of controlled substances revealed profound ideas on human sexuality, humanity, U.S. drug policy, literature philosophy and logic.  He was the bearer of deep pain and trauma and interpreted the world through a unique lense as the child of a middle class, Ivy League-educated upbringing.

He was one of several key figures of the beat movement yet did not identify with the hippie movement which he would eventually inspire.

Filled with great interviews, I found this film greatly satisfying.",1503360000,,688,5.162162162162162
