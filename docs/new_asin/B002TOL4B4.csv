3985989,4,B002TOL4B4,"""The Unfaithful"" is a 1947 social commentary often mistaken for a murder mystery or film noir. The theme is adultery and divorce, which were popular themes in the post war period. It was very loosely adapted from a 1927 Somerset Maugham Broadway play that was a 1929 film with Regional Owen and a 1940 Bette Davis film called ""The Letter"" (FWIW - Davis received an Oscar nomination for her role in that film).

Adultery has been a staple of filmdom since the earliest years and continues to this day. Among the best of the genre are films like ""Body Heat"" (1981), ""The Bridges of Madison County"" (1995), ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), ""The English Patient"" (1996), and, of course, ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987).

Sexy Ann Sheridan (1915-67) plays a married woman who kills an intruder (But was he really an intruder?). Sheridan was one of the biggest box office stars of the late 30s and 40s and a top pinup girl in WW 2 when she was called ""The Oomph Girl"". She appeared in such box office hits as ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938), ""They Made me a Criminal"" (1939), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1942), and ""Kings Row"" (1941).  Known for her sex appeal, there is a solid actress underneath and she shows it here.

Handsome Zachary Scott (1914-65) often played a scoundrel in films like ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945), ""Flamingo Road"" (1949), and ""Shadow on the Wall"" (1950), often paired with Ann Sothern, Nancy Davis, or Joan Crawford. Scott plays Sheridan's husband but he plays against type in this one.

Lew Ayres (1908-96) performance in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) propelled him to early stardom. That's the good news. But the horrors of war remained with him, so when WW 2 came around, he refused to serve in a combat position and instead enrolled in the medical corps. But an ultrapatriotic Hollywood took this as a sign of cowardice (never mind that many leading stars didn't serve didn't serve at all), and his Hollywood career would never be the same. This was one of his first films back after the war. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1948) and for an Emmy for a guest appearance on ""Kung Fu"" (1972). He's probably best known from his portrayal as Dr. Kildare in a series of 40s films. Ayres plays a divorce lawyer and a friend of the family.

Funny and sarcastic Eve Arden (1908-90) plays the alpha female in a pride of catty women who are in various stages of cheating on their husbands or getting a divorce. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) but she's best known for her Emmy winning role as ""Our Miss Brooks"" (1952-6). Arden is her usual riotous self. Here's a few of her choice lines -

* ""Isn't that Joan stupid? Poor dear, she's not smart enough to be an idiot""
* ""I know you don't approve of me. Of course, I don't approve of me either.""
* ""I always wanted to go to morning court but I was afraid they would think I was the defendant. I look so guilt in the morning.""
* ""I don't know what's taking them [the jury] so long. They probably just want those free meals.""

But not only is Arden a riot, she also shows that she's a great actress, especially in her scene with Scott near the end of the film in which she offers one of the first feminist analyses of marriage.

Jerome Cowan (1897-1972) plays the D.A. He appeared in more than 100 films, remembered best for his roles as the DA in ""Miracle on 34th Street"", Dagwood's boss Mr. Radcliffe in the ""Blondie"" series (1938-43), and Bogart's partner Miles Archer from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941).

Stern faced John Hoyt (1905-91) plays the investigator. Hoyt was a member of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. He was very active and appeared in more than 200 films and TV shows: for example, in 1951 he appeared in 10 films. I remember him best as Brutus in Brando's ""Julius Caesar"" (1953).

The villain of the piece is blackmailer Steven Geray (1904-73) who is a pawn broker who was given a sculpture of Sheridan done by the man she killed. Geray appeared in more than 100 films between 1929 and 1966. With his distinct European accent he provided good support in films like ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1941), ""The Seventh Cross"" (1944), and ""Spellbound"" (1945).

Vincent Sherman (1906-2006) directs. Though he made many films with Humphrey Bogart (""Return of Dr. X"", ""All Through the Night"", ""Across the Pacific"") and his good friend Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Don Juan""), Clark Gable (""Lone Star""), he is generally known as a ""woman's director."" Sherman was investigated by HUAC in the 50s, which ended his film career and he made the transition to TV where he worked on series such as ""The Waltons"", ""Baretta"" and ""77 Sunset Strip"".

Ernest Haller (1896-1970) provides beautiful black and white photography and shows really good dynamic movement of the camera. It's also a nice tour of post war Los Angeles. Haller filmed more than 100 movies and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, three times for films with Bette Davis (""Jezebel"" in 1938, ""All This and Heaven Too"" in 1940, and ""Whatever Happened to baby Jane?"" in 1962), and won once for ""GWTW"" (1939).

Austrian composer Max Steiner contributes a low key musical score. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" and the box office leaders included ""Unconquered"", ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer"", ""Mother Wore Tights"" and ""Life with Father."" Other notable films that year were ""Dark Passage"" (Bogart), ""The Lady From Shanghai"" (Orson Welles), and ""Possessed"" (Joan Crawford).

The NY Times called it a ""better than average murder mystery"" and said it ""jabs like a hit-and-run prizefighter at the subject of hasty divorces and the dangerous consequences to society of this ill conceived cure all for marital difficulties, but it never gets across a telling dramatic punch."" The film did well at the box office and furthered the career of the principals, earning director Sherman a new 5 year contract with Warners.

A few words why this is not ""film noir"" in the classic sense. Film noir has certain conventions, although few films meet all conventions. The most demanding is suggested by the word ""noir"" - film noir movies are usually dark. They take place at night, often in the rain, and action takes place in shadows, often in seedy places. The next most important part of film noir is the ""double cross' or even better the ""triple cross"" which is best executed by an attractive female who has alluring control over a hapless man who is caught in her web. Add to these three essential elements a downbeat ending, a cast of interesting though seedy characters, and some well time bad luck, and you have the classic film noir.

This film doesn't conform in any way. There are no night or rain scenes nor alleys etc. Although we have a woman committing adultery while he husband is away at the war, there is no real ""double"" or ""triple"" cross and Ann Sheridan certainly isn't a femme fatale. There is no long list of seedy characters; in fact, most of the characters are ""upright"" citizens.

One of the reasons this film is often mistaken for film noir is that the 1940 Bette Davis film is truly film noir, but this film was changed significantly from that film (which conformed better to the play). Instead, this film takes as its theme the problems that the war can create for husband and wife who are separated. There are quite a few wordy scenes that discuss this problem. In retrospect it may seem overblown, but at the time this public airing of such a common problem probably did a lot of good for a lot of people.

But don't let the fact that this isn't film noir dissuade you from watching a good film. The acting is great, the photography and music are good.

I gave this film a 4 out of 5. If Amazon used a 10 point scale it would be a 9.",1312156800,20,8085,4.63986013986014

8380592,4,B002TOL4B4,"I first saw this picture some forty years ago while a teenager growing up in small town Connecticut, in the days of Sunday afternoon movies and the late-late show from New York City's channel five, the only outlet for old films in the '60s and '70s, and though I never came upon this movie again, until this recent DVD release, I always remembered ""The Unfaithful""  fondly,  looked for it on television and later on home video. To tell the truth,  all I remember about this one was that Ann Sheridan starred, and was perfect in the lead, in the same style of ""Mildred Pierce"", another mid-night find via NYC-5, and though Ann's star character was not the classic Joan Crawford's Mildred was, she had moments in this film that came pretty damn close, so I have to leave off one star for my review, but also make the point that putting Ann Sheridan up against Joan Crawford in a review for this film is really not  fair to either Sheridan or Crawford, especially when talking about ""Mildred Pierce"", In any other Crawford picture chances are, for my money, Sheridan would win hands down.  Sheridan was a much more interesting actress, capable of playing a larger variety of  roles, from comedy to drama, and most everything in-between, Joan was a one note actress, and the bulk of her movie performances bare this out.  Weather it was her ""flapper"" silents of the 1920s; the ""shop-girl makes good"" (usually by marrying her millionaire boss) roles of the '30s; to her film noir leads, hard boiled dames and gangster molls of the '40s; to her rather pathetic ""older woman/younger man"" love sagas of the '50s, Crawford played each character with the same degree of hyperbole and ""monotone"" brand of acting, to the point that the end result was her roles over the years become a bit of a blur, one movie starts to resemble a slightly smudged carbon copy of the one that came before, a problem Ann Sheridan seldom had to face.  She not only handled every one of her movies with fine acting, was most often perfectly cast in the lead role, and if one of her movies lagged here and there, her beauty carried her through the slow parts of many a picture.  ""The Unfaithful"" is a perfect melodramatic ""mystery"" in the ""Mildred Pierce"" vain, from plot to casting, visual style to production values, only a slightly less ""class A"" production style, the smaller filming budget noticeable here and there, (and only when one compares ""The Unfaithful"" along side ""Mildred Pierce"") and I stand by Ann Sheridan and ""The Unfaithful"" over Crawford's ""Mildred Pierce"", flaws and all, for many reasons, most listed above, but mainly because Ann shows her self and acting talent for dramatics, while Crawford playing ""Mildred"" is really just playing the same character she had made a career of for forty years; herself.",1418774400,5,2794,4.7443298969072165
8380593,3,B002TOL4B4,"Just caught this little known semi-gem at our local art house theater as part of their film noir festival. Interestingly lots of commentators call this a remake of The Letter but I don't see the resemblance myself. Also I don't really consider it film noir. Rather I'd describe it as a drawing room melodrama with large doses of adultery, blackmail and courtroom procedure. And it just plain doesn't have the look of noir.
Unfaithful has an A list of talent but the result is curiously B movie-ish and flat. Ann Sheridan never did that much for me. I always thought of her as a cut-rate Rita Hayworth. Although she does some good acting work here, she looks washed out and tired in most of the scenes, suitable for the character perhaps but not flattering. Moreover, she looks downright anorexic with her ultra-thin, delicate frame. And all those awful 40s style women's clothes the ladies had to wear...
The best part is the wisecracking Eve Arden and the great on location scenes - love that Bunker Hill streetcar! Also I thought Marta Mitrovich as the dead guy's widow was just great - nobody has commented on the physical resemblance between her and Ann Sheridan (film noir did love the idea of doubles). Especially so in the scene where Marta is sitting next to the sculpture. It couldn't have been an accident. BTW too bad the Code didn't allow the sculpture to be a nude. Sigh. Max Steiner's score is competent but not really memorable.
Summary: a professional effort but ultimately not that special or interesting. A solid three stars.",1405900800,,1543,4.7611940298507465
8380594,3,B002TOL4B4,"This is a known ""ripoff"" of Maugham's classic, ""The Letter,"" several versions of which preceded this one. The most famous version is Bette Davis's, and it was also made starring Jeanne Eagles, and a TV version starring Lee Remick. ""The Unfaithful"" is for collectors (like me).
Ann Sheridan, in the starring role, is a delight, as always, but I cannot say the same for her two leading men.",1397001600,,388,4.720588235294118
