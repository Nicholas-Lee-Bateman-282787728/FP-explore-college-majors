2559766,4,B000FBH3WM,"I give this review four stars because one of the original cast is gone now. I am speaking of David Garrison who left Married...With Children in the middle of the sitcom's fourth season to continue broadway roles. It was written that Garrison's character Steve Rhoades,who had lost his job as an accountant,unmercifully left his beautiful,endearing wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) and became a forest ranger. So Marcy is still single until mid-season when she marries playboy Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days veteran Ted McGinley) in her sleep!(she woke up with a wedding ring on one of her fingers and not the same one she wore during her marriage to Steve). The Bundys hold a backyard wedding for Mr. and Mrs. D'Arcy. Peggy(Katey Sagal) plays her accordion at the wedding. Bud(David Faustino) tried numerous times to score with Marcy,post-Steve and pre-Jefferson. Other highlights this season include the Bundys in a brawl with another family of four during Labor Day weekend gridlock. Al(Ed O'Neill) and Kelly(Christina Applegate) spend time on their living room sofa while they both battle nasal congestion. The Bundys in court with a civil lawsuit against someone they had a road collision with. Al is prepared with a briefcase that will contain the lawsuit cash. Dr. Joyce Brothers,a former advice columnist,played the presiding judge. Marcy even testified at the trial(she witnessed a Mercedes was involved in the collision). She whined and complained about that very same car that Steve had(""He left me like parsley on a plate at a truck stop diner!""). Kelly becomes a model for an automobile commercial. Gilligan's Island veteran Tina Louise plays the casting director. Also,Al makes Peggy jealous by receiving numerous attention from shapely beauties who witness him lifting a heavy couch. Also,for the beauties' sake,he changes his ways! He showers and brushes his teeth regularly! He even quit wearing his Hanes briefs! Peggy wanted the old Al back. And Al went back to his old,usual self. Al takes a job as a night watchman at his alma mater,Polk High School where Bud is a student and Kelly and Peggy are alumni of themselves. There's the two-part ""You Better Shop Around"",which is available on Most Outrageous Episodes,Part 2. The Bundys,in that episode,seek shelter in a supermarket,and Al accidentally becomes the one millionth customer of the day. He stepped ahead of Marcy who was in the checkout line since he only had a pack of chewing gum. As Al was checked out,balloons and confetti fell. Marcy was bitching that she was originally the next in line. Al says to her,""You still are!"". Then Al checks out a headline in the National Enquirer which reads ""Steve Rhoades to marry Cher"". Marcy couldn't wait to check out that headline about her ex-husband. The other episodes are great. McGinley was billed as a guest star this season,since he had not joined MWC at the beginning. He guest-starred in the season 4 two-part episode ""It's A Bundyful Christmas"" which Fox aired as a whole on December 24,1989. McGinley's character was Norman Jablonski,who appeared in a dream that Al had. In the dream,Norman was the household patriarch instead of Al! 5 down,6 to go.",1144713600,52,3168,5.094230769230769

2559787,4,B000FBH3WM,"This was one of the middle seasons of MWC(Married with Children) and as with most comedy series, one of the better years.  I won't give a litany of the shows one by one as other reviewers have done that.

By this, the 5th season, we are in full Bundy form.  Noone eats or drinks, no practical shopping, and no friends of any value.  It is total nihilism, a cynical view of middle America (outside Chicago) with undertones of dysfunction, sex, humor and inadequacy.

The star, shoe salesman Al, has no interest in his hot wife, his much hotter neighbor, his job, or life.  The wife, Peg, is utterly useless, unwilling to shop for necessities, let alone cook or clean.  The son,Bud,is a good student but socially awkward, to say the least.  The daughter, Kelly, is at her zenith looks wise, but continues to be clueless about life outside of dating a guy...or two...on Friday nights.

It's hard to believe that this basic set-up survived the cut for over a decade; it did, though, and was funny until the end.  Perhaps because we are more like this family than the absurd TV families of the 1950's and 1960's, we watch this show and cringe as we also laugh nervously.  A-ha, so THAT's what life was like...",1373846400,,1204,4.553488372093023
2559788,5,B000FBH3WM,I loved this show when I was growing up.  Al Bundy is the classic American dad.  Great all around trip of hilarity down memory lane.,1371686400,,132,4.24
2559789,4,B000FBH3WM,"Would've easily given this season five stars BUT once again they cheaped out on the royalties to the ""Love and Marriage"" theme song. Instead, we get a tacky, synthesized, sound-alike track that runs over the opening sequence and end credits.

The beginning of each episode just doesn't have the same 'oomph' without the Frank Sinatra song, but the episodes themselves are well-preserved and are still funny.",1324080000,,407,5.166666666666667

I had heard that it was missing, but I said, 'so what'? Well it turned out to be a major ,'so what'.I don't even feel like I'm watching the Bundy's. This is worse than some bootleg. I wish I hadn't bought it, even for only $13.49. Now, I've got to deal with season four, that I ordered, and it's on it's way, ikk!",1287705600,,438,3.977272727272727

2559793,5,B000FBH3WM,"Married with Children - The Complete Fifth Season is pretty much flawless in terms of acting and storylines. Christina Applegate is hilarious as Kelly Bundy, she was born to play this character. Season 5 is my personal favorite. Season 6 is the last great season, after that the show went downhill. Stick with seasons 1-6, those are classic.",1246665600,,341,4.896551724137931
2559794,4,B000FBH3WM,"This 1990-91 Season of The Bundy's was hilarious and was the season when I got to like this show and got hooked on it, especially since I never watched MARRIED WITH CHILDREN during it's first 4 seasons on FOX.

This is also the season when Jefferson D'Arcy(Ted McGinley) joins the cast and crew of the show in the Winter of 1991 replacing his predecessor Steve Rhoades(David Garrison), except Marcy doesn't even realize she's remarried till she wakes up next to Jefferson, which happens in the second half of the Bundy's 5th Season which also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley since I was a Senior in high school at Central Union High in El Centro, CA at the time during this 1990-91 Season on Fox when we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had back then when George Bush, Sr. was the president.

I also liked seeing knockout Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) as the Weenie-Tot girl and the Ellante car commercial where she wears spiffy dresses outclassing all the contestants along with the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN is the show that made Christina Applegate a star, since she wasn't even famous till she got her role as Kelly Bundy, even though Christina Applegate had a guest starring role on FAMILY TIES as Jennifer Keaton's pal(Kitten) when FAMILY TIES was in it's 5th Season and when MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was in it's 1st Season.

It was also interesting seeing Matt LeBlanc before his days as Joey Tribbiani on FRIENDS, especially since Matt Le Blanc's guest starring role on the Bundy's was before he was even famous, so it was almost like seeing Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) going out with Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc) in a way, since most people now know Matt LeBlanc from FRIENDS.

I also enjoyed seeing Tina Louise from GILLIGANS ISLAND on the Bundy's and watching Ted McGinley becoming a co-star on this show remembering him from his days on HAPPY DAYS and THE LOVE BOAT, despite the fact that I actually liked Steve better than Jefferson, since Steve was much smarter, a lot wiser, a lot more dedicated, a lot more compassionate, and a lot more responsible than Jefferson ever was, despite the fact that Jefferson was kind of a funny doofus.

Overall, Married With Children's Fifth Season is a great season and is even better than the first 4 seasons of the Bundy's, so I recommend it to any Bundy fan, although a better title for this show would've been THE BUNDY'S, not MARRIED WITH CHIDREN, since THE BUNDY'S would've fitted the shows title better explaining what the Bundy's are really liked without giving the term ""Married With Children"" a bad name or a false impression for married life with kids in real-life along with the fact that this was the show that made a lot of people want to stay single as well as the show that wanted us to stay childless and the show that many people tried to get cancelled too, due to the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was crude and a bad influence just like SOUTHPARK and THE FAMILY GUY were.

By the way I just got word that Married With Children's 11th Season is now in the works to be released this Fall on Tuesday October 13th, 2009 which I can hardly wait for since the Bundy's 1996-97 Season is their last & final season on top of that.",1219104000,,3293,4.610921501706485

Sure the humor is almost always crude, but that's what makes it so good. The Bundys are absolutely hilarious. Al's shattered dreams and Peggy's stupendous carelessness are the highlights for almost every episode. Kelly's low intelligence and Bud's failing love life completes the dysfunctional family. And let's not forget their neighbors: the chicken-legged Marcy, and the charming but unemployed Jefferson, and (from the earlier seasons) the one-and-only Steve.

Kelly not knowing a thing makes it so much funnier, and of course Al having the common sense in the family, but then when it boils down to the core he is as dumb as the rest of the family.

2559811,3,B000FBH3WM,"First let me say I've been a dedicated bundyite since '87, and I really do understand the sometimes outrages costs of music distribution rights.  That being said, OMG this replacement theme is getting sooooooo old.  With hand on heart I swear, by the time the fifth season came out, I would be happier with 45 seconds of silence over the credits.  To think this awful carnival merry-go-round music will be with us through the end of the eleventh season... ug.  You can tell this series was granted a minimal budget from the start and has bounced from company to company for production.  What I don't understand is why?  These disks sell!  I mean people really buy up this show.  It's truly a classic and it certainly paid the bills at Fox for a while.  It deserves better, we deserve better.

  I would like to say the crew in charge of the project did the best they could with such a tight budget, but I don't know about that.  How about some bonus material, ANY bonus material!  You can't tell me after eleven seasons there's no trace of blooper footage, or cut scenes, or some kind of behind the scenes material?  Is there absolutely nobody associated with this show during production willing to do commentary?  Through the years this show produced a number of ""Bundy Specials"", but where are they?  Kudos for the MWC reunion special on the season 1 set, but taking the same footage and pulling out little bits of it to make a hide-and-seek game on the next set was silly, calling that material new was just stupid.

  Now it's the fifth season and though I'm very pleased to replace my old tape with DVD, there's still no real effort here.  The packaging is decent and sturdy and the art shows some good thought.  The disks are single sided, which is very good and I hope they don't ever stoop to double sided disks to save another buck.  Producers... listen to me, people HATE double sided disks.  It's going off topic to discus the 1001 reasons why, only to say that I really hope they continue with the three single sided disks for MWC.

  Picture quality is great, the Dolby is great, the show is great, and if that's enough for you, your covered.  On the other hand, if you would like to see anything that makes this set worth owning, beyond the convince of not having to rewind and fast forward VHS tape, forget it.  At least with old tape you can still hear the proper theme.",1159315200,7,2386,4.4837209302325585
2559812,5,B000FBH3WM,"Here it is, the fifth season of legendary father and husband Al ""Touchdown"" Bundy and his wonderful co-stars.

There really isn't much to say anymore, everybody knows the show, and how could anyone forget its great sense for edgy storylines and poignant cynicism? Married With Children is outstanding in many ways, but a few things really stand out.

For one, it's one of the very few shows out there whose appeal and wit almost exclusively come from the characters themselves and the different dynamics they bring to each scene.

It's also outstanding that, even though they are mostly centered around Al, you could take any of the six main characters, let a whole show revolve around him/her, and it would result in a classic.

Some say season 5 marks the beginning of the end for Married With Children. But I say this is not entirely true. Like every long- running show, it eventually had to change its tone. Such a change is just inevitable if you want to avoid running out of ideas. But, like I said in the Seinfeld review, that's not a decline in quality, that's just a change of style.

But I don't want to say that season 5 does everything right. In my opinion, it started something that would haunt later seasons: repetition. It relies on running gags a bit too often. It's always a variation on ""no sex with me"", ""how could I marry you?"", ""Bud will die as a virgin"" or ""my sister does anyone"".

But despite this flaw, Al Bundy is still one of the great American idols, and for a reason.

The DVD, as usual, is quite poor. No bonuses, no interviews, no inside looks, no nothing. But that shouldn't keep you from getting it; not even the absence of Frank Sinatra's song should.

Oh, and here's a little note to Sony: do you realise that this October (2006), Married With Children's 7th season will be released here in Germany? What's taking you so long over there? Give it some gas!",1158710400,3,1890,4.554572271386431
2559813,2,B000FBH3WM,"I wrote a review for season one, saying basically that this series was one of the best written and acted for a comedy, for the first 5 years...Actually 4 and a half.  Season 5 has some good episodes, but other negative reviewers pointed out correctly how the show changed from funny, to mean and cartoonish.

This is a good forum so people can read what others think about a show before they buy it.  Unfortunately most of you that vote are devout fans of this and others series, and will say it was not helpful even if it was...

The other reviewers are right on...Season 1-4 great, Season 5 showing a big downgrade, then bombs away with quality after that.

While I love and can appreciate many of the classic episodes from earlier seasons, I have to disagree with several reviewers in that I feel we are only now breaking into the BEST seasons.  For as much as I liked Steve Rhoades, Jefferson Darcy grew on me and became a more likeable character.  The NO MA'AM stuff (which doesn't even come for another 1 or 2 seasons) is the stuff of legend.  Who *doesn't* like Bob Rooney?  My point is that I felt the show really found its footing in this season and, while it may have become a bit more cartoonish and Al may have became a more hateful person, it made the show that much funnier.  Personally, I cannot wait for the infamous ""Ms. Blaub"" episode from season 7.  Bring on the rest, bring on the best!",1153958400,2,794,4.324324324324325

2559819,2,B000FBH3WM,"Married with children has been my favorite comedy tv show for a long time. Unfortunately, on the fifth season the show begins to lose the style and focus that made it so great. Al changes completely. He goes from a struggling shoe salesman who gets no respect from his wife or kids(or from no one for that matter)to a bully. He doesn't get a lot of lip from Peg anymore, which was hilarious to watch from the previous seasons. I think that was the funny subject of the show, how no nobody would listen to him or respect him, and still he would go on. All that changed  during the fifth season, changing completely the focus,style (and the quality of the storylines)of the series.",1153872000,6,679,4.475806451612903
2559820,5,B000FBH3WM,"I am a true fan of MWC!  I say this because I miss the ""Love and Marriage"" beginning, but the show is still a classic without it.  It is on DVD, just go past the opening!  I don't even notice anymore.  I miss Steve, but I feel the writers did an excellent job of taking him out of the cast with a Blast!  They didn't make the mistake of replacing him right away or worse... replacing him with someone just like him.  Jefferson turned Marcy into a Suga Mama!  Married w/ Children is great, because it makes you laugh.  When your life seems really, really bad... watch MWC and realize Al's life is worse.  I am glad the 5th Season is here and am anxiously awaiting Seasons 6-11!  My VHS tapes are worn also!  Thanks Ed, Christina, David, Katey, Ted, and Amanda... the MWC cast and their writers for keeping me entertained.",1153440000,2,820,4.328947368421052
2559821,3,B000FBH3WM,"First, I love Married With Children. I love it so much I wrote a spec script in 1989 and was flown out to California to meet with Ellen Fogle supervising producer and had a pitch session to sell scripts to them. They invited my back to pitch a year later... In any case---Season 5 is the beginning of the End. Yes, it's true the ""Jefferson"" character is far weaker than Steve Rhoades, and I really liked David Garrison on the show more than McGinley. But that is not why Season 5 turned the show.

First it is important to note that during Season 5, original creater/producer Ron Leavitt decided he had enough leaving only Moye to stay on. This changed the focus of the show. Moye is a finwe writer but something happened during this Season that turned AL BUNDY from a REAL American Hero-Working Class Guy, into a CARTOON CHARACTER. And it happened in the episode where AL plants a Vegetable Garden and goes ""Wabbit Hunting"". What happened is--all REALITY for the character and show went out the window . After this show, the episodes became ""dumber"" ""more cartoonish"" ""simpler"" and AL BUNDY changed from a Good Soul who Sold Soles to a mean, Bully who drank beer with the guys and beat people up in a cartoon manner. The stories became too silly for anyone to beleive or CARE about (I mean--remember the episode where Bundy has to return the Library Book ""Don't Bundy that Book"" (a classic episode). It was based in reality. Someone could forget to bring back a book. But starting with Season 5--we have AL ""hunting Wabbits"" ""Aliens stealing socks"" (OK that episode is a classic--I admit that) and so on...each season becomes progressively more common and less intelligent while ""AL"" becomes less Willy Lohman and more ""Wrestlemania"". I will buy Season 5 because there still are some very funny episodes..but whern you get to Season 6-11? Im out LOL",1152748800,6,1850,4.674846625766871
2559822,4,B000FBH3WM,"Being a Dutchman, I came into contact with this amazingly funny series years later than the US audiences. That doesn't change the fact, though, that MWC has rapidly become my alltime favourite TV comedy. It always gets me roaring with laughter. Whenever I feel tense or down and out, I put an episode of MWC in the DVD-player and instantaneously feel much better. My kids (a girl and a boy) watch their father howling with laughter with complete and utter amazement every time. They have approximately the same ages as Kelly and Bud --and even look a little bit like them--, but they don't understand (yet) what I find so funny about all this. I guess you need to be married with children for a number of years yourself to truly appreciate MWC. I watched a great number of episodes of MCW on TV, but I missed a lot of them too, so I am profoundly glad that they have now become available on DVD. I won't gripe about the alternative opening music, or the lack of extra's on the DVD. There's only two things I really want: the original, unedited episodes with all the rudeness, violence and insults. Apart from Season 4, we / I got that. But most of all I would like Sony to release the series at a much, much faster rate. I simply cannot wait until 2009 to finally see Season 11. I guess if I have to I will, --what other choice is there?-- but why does it take so extremely long ? Especially since there are no time-consuming extras on the DVD. I bought Season 5 two days ago and I already watched the first 15 episodes. Please Sony, speed it up ! But whatever you do, release the complete series. I only give 4 instead of the possible 5 stars, because the quality of the DVD (sound and image) and the picture transfer are quite good, but the DVD is utterly devoid of any extras.",1151971200,6,1779,4.345345345345345
2559823,3,B000FBH3WM,"This griping about the theme song being replaced by an alternate song track is pointless.  It's beyond Sony's control and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

Besides, this alternate theme began with Columbia Tristar on the Third Season.  Maybe Columbia decided not to continue to release ""Married...with Children"" because they couldn't get Frank Sinatra's ""Love and Marriage"".  What if releasing ""Married..with Children"" just ended right there?  You should thank Sony for choosing to continue releasing ""Married...with Children's"" future seasons episodes.  I appreciate that Sony picked up where Columbia left off.  At least, Sony's got the sense to know that this show is going to continue to sell.  Columbia threw away a great residual profit maker.

Anyway, on with Season Five:  I'm sorry to say, that my interest into this show is going to probably end right here.  This season does have some great episodes.  It starts out really strong.  Disc One is my favorite.  Why is that?  Probably because I'm not too fond of the Jefferson D'Arcy character that started on Disc Two.  Steve Rhoades was a money-grubbing stuck-up pig.  Even Marcy shared in the pride of laughing at the poor (and putting down the Bundy's).  But with Steve gone and Jefferson now as Marcy's husband, even Marcy has become a less-interesting character on the show.  Jefferson is a (proudly) spineless, lazy, idiot that you would think Marcy would have no tolerance for.  And these shows written with Jefferson just aren't as interesting as Steve Rhoades made them to be.  And they could have made a more interesting episode on how Marcy met Jefferson.  Waking up suddenly married to a stranger was just too empty of an episode.  Not far-fetched, just too weak.  This truly reinforced how the show was going to start diminishing in appeal for me.

So, with Season Six, and the seasons there after, I'll probably just rent them first.  I really don't want to get stuck with another weak season like the last two discs of this Season Five.",1151884800,5,2016,4.961077844311378
2559824,4,B000FBH3WM,"The show is great, but Sony needs to stop being so stubborn, get the real 'Love and Marriage' theme music back, and why no bonuses? How much can it possibly cost to throw in a few bloopers? Those are funny and they must have hundreds of them lying around. I can't fault the show, though.. Al Bundy is truly the King, and he has some of the best lines like ""GET OUT OF THE WAY, BEHEMOTH!"" to a fat woman immediately after promising God he'd be nice to everyone in a prayer, if only Kelly could win a modelling job. That cracks me up every time, no matter how many times I see it. Some people don't like Ted McGinley, but I think he does a good job as Jefferson. He really bonds well with Al in the later seasons.. I am looking forward to those later seasons for two reasons: Big'uns magazine, and No Ma'am! Can't wait! Bottom line is Married With Children easily runs rings around the newer ""comedies?"" that networks spew out today.",1151539200,4,931,4.295454545454546
2559825,1,B000FBH3WM,"Don't get me wrong, I love Married....with Children. I think it is one of the greatest shows ever created. If anyone besides Sony had released the DVD's, I would have given it 5 stars instead of 1. No special features, no bonus materials, no interviews, no nothing, just the episodes and nothing more. Yet it still took Sony a year and a half to release season 5. In my opinion, the people at Sony who put together season 5 need to be fired. The episodes themselves are great. At least Sony didn't screw them up like they did in season 4 by releasing the edited episodes. Married....with Children will live on forever as one of the funniest shows ever aired on television, but Sony has alot, and I do mean ALOT to learn about producing decent DVD's in a timely manner.",1151280000,11,768,4.453900709219858
2559826,5,B000FBH3WM,"There's really not a bad episode in the bunch.  Starting with the labor day episode ""we'll follow the sun"", which is just as funny as season 4's labor day episode.

""Al.. with Kelly"" is another classic, Al has the weekend off with Bud and Peg out of town, but Kelly comes down with the flu, disrupting Al's daydreams.  The ending to this episode is one the great MWC endings EVER.

""Sue Casa, his Casa"" is the episode where the kids get into a car accident with Al's uninsured car and they go to court.  Marcy's breakdown on the witness stand is a classic.

the weakest episodes are probably ""the dance show"" and ""top of the heap"", which is an episode that was trying to pull a spin-off of another show.

""Married... with aliens"" is one of the all-time greats, Al is visited by six aliens who steal his socks.  He's terrified, odviously. Marcy scares him while he's hiding in the closet, his reaction is hilarious.

""Wabbit season"" is an episode where Al goes nuts, and his psychiatrist suggests he starts his own vegetable garden.  The title of the episode reveals what happens next.

""One down, two to go"" has one of the funniest scenes ever, pay attention to what Al is listening to on the television with the ""buddy burger"" commercial.

""All-night security dude"", also has one of the best scenes ever.

Watch the degregation scene where Al is forced to turn in his ""badge and nightstick"".  The music that plays and the whole set up of the scene is HILARIOUS.

Theres 25 episodes, so i can't review them all, i just pointed out a few highlights.

Maybe the best season of ""Married...with children"" from top to bottom.  This show was definitely in its zenith during the 1990-91 season.

A must have for all ""married...with children"" fans.",1151020800,6,1740,4.612377850162867
2559827,4,B000FBH3WM,"Learn the true secrets for domestic bliss from television's favorite dysfunctional family in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Fifth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the outrageously funny comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al resorts to extreme measures to stop a rabbit from ruining his vegetable garden. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) wakes up after a drunken night next to her new husband Jefferson Darcy (Ted McGinley). Al and Peggy (Katey Segal) try to have another baby to win a hefty inheritance. The Bundys and the Darcys face off to become the winners of a $1000 supermarket shopping spree. The fifth season of ""Married... with Children"" marks the introduction of Ted McGinley's character to the show. The season features guest appearances by Pamela Anderson, Matt LeBlanc, Tia Carrere, B.B. King, Dan Castellaneta, Jerry Mathers and Dr. Joyce Brothers. The 100th episode ""Top of the Heap"" was the pilot of an unsuccessful spin-off that only lasted 7 episodes.

If you enjoyed the madcap misadventures of the dysfunctional Bundy family, then you'll definitely want to pick up ""Married... with Children: The Complete Fifth Season"" All 25 episodes of the fifth season are presented in 1.33:1 full frame format. The picture quality on these three discs isn't spectacular but still brighter and cleaner than your average television rebroadcast. Its simple 2.0 Dolby Digital sound won't win any awards but gets the job done. Unfortunately, there are no special features in this DVD release. Overall, the 3-disc DVD set is pretty simple but there are enough memorable episodes and hilarious moments to make it worth while. ""Married... with Children: The Complete Fifth Season"" gets a ""B-"".",1150761600,3,1893,5.31
2559828,5,B000FBH3WM,"I was a faithful viewer Married...With Children from 1987 to 1997. I couldn't resist to preorder this and at a good price too. I stayed up day and night to watch the entire Married... With Children Complete Fifth Season 3-disc set. I was laughing for hours and hours. This set is strongly recommended and if you don't have the other four seasons, pick them up right away and you will not be disappointed other than the replaced theme song on the third season and later. They should get Love ""And Marriage"" back on the dvd sets quick. But, it's the scripts and cast that makes up a show, not the theme song. Other than that, the season set has good stereo sound and crystal clear film transfer to dvd. The first couple of seasons looked so dark in color, but the third season up to now is clearer and brighter than ever. There are no good bonus features. Only other tv-on-dvd preview trailers. What I would've liked to have seen would be the behind the scenes, making-the-episode, and other interviews or specials that originally aired along with the seasons such as the fourth season's Earth Day special which was not included on the fourth season dvd set, but would've been nice and the entire second season Valentine's Day episode. For those of you who do or don't remember, in February of 1988 you could call in and vote if Al would say ""I Love You"" to Peg or not. Including both endings they shot would've made that season even better. Audio commentaries by Michael Moye, Ron Leavitt, Ed O'Neil, Katey Sagal, Amanda Bearse, Ted McGinley, David Faustino, and Christina Applegate should've been on this dvd set and all others before it (including David Garrison). None of these actors are doing anything right now except for Ted McGinley so there is no reason why they couldn't have shoot some bonus footage or gotten at least some interviews from the most important characters. What Sony Entertainment should really do is lower the price on all of the later sets since they don't have to pay the big bill for the use of Frank Sinatra's ""Love And Marriage."" This will not stop me from purchasing later releases of Married...With Children dvd's, but I honestly think and I believe some others may agree with me, that Sony should've waited to release the third, fourth, and fifth seasons until they had complete episodes (7 edited syndication episodes in fourth season) and the original theme song (only on best-of dvds and first and second season). This set will entertain you and your entire family. The best part is no commercials to fast forward (if you're still watching old recorded VHS tapes) and you're not stuck watching syndicated episodes such as what they play on the Fox cable channel, FX. This is A+ comedy from A+ actors. Also, a a cheap best-of theme dvd with all christmas or thanksgiving episodes to give as a gift would be cool too.  Also, I don't think it would hurt Sony to put out more than one set per year instead of only one because, it's been three and a half years since 2003 and they've only put out five sets and we aren't getting any worthwhile bonus features.

2559832,4,B000FBH3WM,"First off, I don't want anyone to think I'm trashing someone elses review.  Please keep that in mind.

I'm giving this an advanced rating of 4 starts because of the possible edits.  Also, I noticed on season 4 that there were no Easter Eggs.  In this day and age, EVERY DVD should have special features of some kind.  Also since they can't get the original song that knocks the rating down.

As for the individual who wrote about this collection being edited and suggesting not but buy it, I'd suggest we take what we can get.  If you have the show on video tape that's great.  I have many of the on tape as well, but time will eventually wear them down.

I'm a fan of the later season episodes of Night Court (after Christine and Roz show up).  I've seen what not buying the series result in.  They are stuck on season 1 and a pittiful collection of best of...scenes.  This is because there wasn't enough interest from the fans when the first season was released so Warner is not very interested in releasing the rest.  Sad thing is, it wasn't until around season 5 or 6 when the show really got good.

As for MWC, becareful of that.  Then again, this show has been good since at least season 3 on.  I've got many of the shows on tape, so whatever is edited, I will still be able to see.

Between Married...With Children, In Living Color, and the few SNL DVDs out, it seems like public television is a more dangerous place than your private DVD collection.  I'm not sure why they keep editing these things.  It is disheartening.

By the way, are the SNL seasons ever going to come out?",1148342400,5,1586,4.348122866894198
