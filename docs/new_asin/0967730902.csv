7794086,1,0967730902,I would like to second the other reviewers remarks.  This video is too short and too basic for the price they are charging for it.  I feel like I was ripped off.,1138579200,3,161,4.0
7794087,1,0967730902,"To pay this much for a video, I was dissapointed in what was not included.  There was no discussion about brushes and their use.  There was no discussion about age appropriate make-up.  There was only one young model.  There was no other skin colors to demonstrate on. Hydration method is just getting your brush wet. It was assumed that you already knew what  you were doing and here are some very expensive helpful hints.  It is only 1/2 hour and you can learn most of it from just reading magazines.  There is a lot of talk about color but not really any instructions about it.  I would like to get my $ back.",1106697600,20,612,4.353982300884955
7794088,2,0967730902,Very very basic. A good tool if you've never applied make-up before in your life.,1095811200,15,81,4.466666666666667
7794089,5,0967730902,"I really enjoyed this video. Pamela has some excellent techniques, and she has so much helpful information in this video. I would definitely recommend this video.",1004745600,23,162,5.269230769230769
