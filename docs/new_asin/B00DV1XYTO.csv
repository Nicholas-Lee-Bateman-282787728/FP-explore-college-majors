5857184,4,B00DV1XYTO,"""The Internship"" is a film which focuses on salesmen Nick Campbell (Owen Wilson) and Billy McMahon (Vince Vaughn) who find themselves out of work because of changing consumer purchasing methods.

Out of their depth and age group they apply for an internship with Google and it is their involvement as part of a team hoping to win a permanent job which is the essence of the narrative.

Whilst the movie may appear straightforward enough on the surface there are much deeper undertones to the story such as age as no barrier to learn and achieve, finding confidence as part of a developing team and appreciating the qualities in people no matter how outgoing or introverted they may be. The combination of these dynamics mixed with some laughs contributes to a film with some enjoyable significance.

5857185,4,B00DV1XYTO,"""The Internship"" opens with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who play traveling salesmen, singing along to the chorus of Alanis Morissette's ""Ironic.""  This is appropriate because they are shortly about to be informed that their company has folded and they no longer have jobs - by one of their clients, just as they are expecting to close a sale. The client further compounds the indignity by telling them that watches are obsolete - everyone just checks their smart phone nowadays.  If you can imagine.

Wilson gets a job with his brother-in-law's mattress store (Will Ferrell in a deadpan cameo), but when Vaughn announces he's found them an internship with Google, he quits and they head over to the software giant, whose campus resembles a blockbuster movie set crossed with a college, that is if the college had nap pods and unlimited free refreshments.  At Google, ""twenty is the new 12,"" and the duo is surrounded by whiz kids whose tech savvy far outstrips theirs, but who are weak on such things as, you know, teamwork and optimism.  Predictably, at first things don't go well, as they learn that the correct answer to ""Is it okay to take food home from the office?"" is not ""Is it perishable - like pizza or a pudding?"" (There is a difference between thinking outside the box and just being a smart aleck.) Predictably they also make enemies, including Max Minghella as a budding yuppie-ish intern, who may or may not have a fake accent, as well as the resentment of their team, who just want to get a job after college.  Like Reese Witherspoon's character in ""Legally Blonde,"" the two eventually realize they need to buckle down and start boning up on their book knowledge to keep up with their more serious peers.  However, they also have valuable life lessons to teach the younger crew (most gleaned from ""Flashdance,"").  Can this ragtag team of misfits come together and triumph?

I've read other reviews by critics who savaged this movie calling it lazy and completely unfunny.  Obviously, from this rating, I disagree, but I didn't go in with sky high expectations.  It's an amusing way to spend a couple of hours, but humor is subjective.  If you're looking for sophisticated wit, however, you'll need to try elsewhere.",1370995200,2,2233,4.816753926701571
5857186,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I'm not sure why viewers go to this sort of film expecting total reality and believability, but of course with a plot such as this one, things aren't exactly real world anyway and for heaven's sake people, this is a comedy.  I won't go into a rehash of the story as others have done that in previous reviews.  I'll just say that I came out of the film happy to have seen it, I got quite a lot of good laughs all the way through, and my final impression was what a basically sweet story it was with sweet and likeable characters.  Only a scene in a lap dancing bar made it a bit inappropriate for younger teens, but otherwise, it is a good story imparting some valuable life lessons for young people who think people over 30 know nothing.  The two main characters were actually quite nice and lovable guys with refreshingly positive attitudes about life and how to treat other people, and ultimately they came out on top preceisely because of these traits.  The film was completely enjoyable beginning to end, and time went fast as the pacing was excellent.  Vaughn as writer & screenwriter did a great job with this, so kudos to him.  Too bad the trailers are lousy and somewhat misrepresent the nature of this film.",1370736000,47,1216,4.475113122171946
5857187,3,B00DV1XYTO,"In spite of generally numb reviews I was lured into the theater just to see Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn restart the bromance that began with ""Wedding Crasher"" in 2005.  Here they play Billy (Vaughn) and Nick a couple of watch salesmen just on one side or the other of age 40.  When their boss (John Goodman) shuts down his business the boys are out of work and with no formal education or technical skills, they decide to apply for an internship at Google.

Since one of the terms of acceptance is that a prospect must be enrolled in college, Billy enrolls the pair at the University of Phoenix which Billy calls, ""the Harvard of on-line colleges."" They show up on the Mountain View campus and are surrounded by 20-something geniuses.  When 5 or 6 person teams are picked, our heroes are left with a group no one wants to associate with.  I'm not sure why as no one seems to know anyone else, so how this group is shunned is beyond me.

No matter, quirky they are but they are also devoid of social skills.  That of course is where salesmen Billy and Nick excel.  Will it be enough however to win the competition which means being automatically hired by Google?  The charm of the movie is the patter between Billy and Nick and Vaughn and Wilson are masters.  While I wouldn't call the movie laugh-out-loud-hilarious, I would say there are plenty funny scenes.

Rose Byrne makes an appearance as a potential love interest and boss for Nick.  Aasif Mandvi is the Google man in charge of the internship program and Max Minghella is the snobby leader of a competitive team.  There is nothing new here.  A couple over their head guys with hearts of gold and a fun personality, teach the techies a thing or two about life outside the physics books.  I'll likely forget about this movie pretty quickly but I did have a good time.",1370649600,41,1823,4.498480243161095
5857188,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson need to do more movies together.  Their on screen comedic chemistry is unlike any other.  I really enjoyed this movie and found it funny, inspiring, and introduces one into how the ""new"" world of the younger generation have limited social skills due to being behind a computer all the time.  Most comedies suck today; not this one.",1370649600,,360,4.774193548387097
5857189,3,B00DV1XYTO,"So you've seen the trailer to The Internship and you're probably thinking what I was thinking: Oh God, that looks like it's going to be awful. I mean right? The trailer doesn't make it seem too appealing. I will review pretty much anything, and I do mean anything. I went into the theater thinking it was going to be on the awful side of ""anything,""

5857190,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Google is a name synonymous with the internet and global information.  Currently, Google is the world's most popular search engine, receiving more than 2 billion views per day and handling 100 billion searches per month.  Officially founded in 1998 (created in 1996), Google received a modest 10,000 searches per day - and the rest is history.  In 2005, while Google was finding its stride, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson teamed up for the modern comedy classic, Wedding Crashers.  Even today, Wedding Crashers is credited with reviving the adult comedy genre, mixing crude humor with a glorified chick flick.  Flash forward to the present day, and who would have guessed Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and Google would be on a collision course?  But, does this comedy duo have what it takes to make a successful movie that appears to be nothing more than a lengthy commercial for one of the wealthiest companies in the world?

Directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Real Steel, & The Watch), The Internship stars Vince Vaughn as Billy McMahon and Owen Wilson as Nick Campbell, two salesmen that find themselves out of a job when their employer goes out of business.  Billy and Nick decide to apply for an internship at Google, the world's largest online internet search engine.  The large group of interns is divided into groups and each group must prove they are the best team, via a series of competitions - with the winning group earning full-time jobs with Google.  Rose Byrne, Max Minghella, Joanna Garcia, and John Goodman star in supporting roles.

Since Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are teaming up once again, it only makes sense to compare their new film together to their highly praised comedy, Wedding Crashers.  First off, yes there is a clear similarity between the plot of Wedding Crashers and The Internship.  Both films revolve around Vaughn and Wilson's characters evolving and stepping into the world of the unknown.  Wedding Crashers focuses more on the two main characters and their relationships, while in similar fashion, The Internship mainly focuses on these two individuals and their quest to make a future for themselves, even though they lack the modern skills of technology.  Unlike Wedding Crashers, The Internship is less focused on the deceit of these characters, centering on the general themes of friendship, teamwork, and individual drive.  Comedy factors aside, there is a great deal to appreciate about this film and the story it tells.  In the beginning of the film, the job loss issues in the United States create momentary sobering issues for the characters' during their unemployment and job uncertainty period.  However, their issue is quickly remedied when they decide to apply to Google (if only the real world worked that easily).

The Internship is not as funny as Wedding Crashers, but that doesn't mean The Internship doesn't have its moments of laughter.  Wedding Crashers focuses more on the sexually driven crude humor, while The Internship is much more light-hearted, often poking fun at nerd stereotypes - like their love for Star Wars, comic books, and the ability to write source code.  Currently in their 40s, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are certainly breaking the age barrier with this film, being surrounded by 18-21 year old computer techs all looking to make a name for themselves in the highly-coveted internet company, Google.  True enough, the plot is silly, filled with endless Google references (that really aren't as bothersome as one might think) - but if you take a film like this as anything other than a huge gag on the real world, you're missing the point.  That's not to say this film makes fun of Google, but it certainly makes a decent amount of humor out of the unlikelihood of acquiring a position in such a competitive environment.

As a whole, The Internship is monumentally cheesy, completely unbelievable, and full of outlandish scenarios.  It is most certainly a throwback film, feeling like a trip back to the turn of the century when Alanis Morissette was still popular.  However, the film quickly takes the trip back to the present day, shooting on sight at the modernized Googleplex (Google's corporate headquarters) in Mountain View, California.  Despite its shortcomings (the occasional tedious dialogue and uninteresting romance subplot), The Internship is a heartwarming film that most will be able to embrace and enjoy.  The film shines bright with its thrifty humor and quirky, outlandish characters - including a hilarious cameo from Will Ferrell.

5857191,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I had high hopes for this movie based on the trailers and the previous Vaughn/Wilson outing ""Wedding Crashers"" and this did not disappoint.

Vaughn and Wilson play salesman whose company goes out of business abruptly, and they find themselves without prospects or hope.  In a stroke of desperation/ inspiration, Vaughn lands them interviews for an internship with Google.  Despite any technological savvy or skills, they find themselves engaged in a team competition among other interns with the prospect of full-time employment in the balance.  Vaughn and Wilson definitely channel their fast-talking characters from Wedding Crashers and have a real chemistry.

A lot of the humor (and there is a lot of it) comes from the culture clash between these non-tech salesmen and the young interns who are incredibly advanced technically, but have no people skills or experience in the ""real world.""

While there are a few plot cliches involved, there are a number of unexpected situations, and you will laugh and smile your way through it all.  There is a lot to enjoy, whether you are on the tech end of the scale or the non-tech end.  I imagine that both groups will laugh at different things, but there is really humor for everyone.

While not as outrageously or consistently funny as ""Wedding Crashers"", this movie was enough fun that I would recommend paying to see it in the theater, and that is (in this age of high ticket prices for mediocre movies) my standard for a good movie.  ""The Internship"" is a light, fun film that deserves to be a box office success.

When you want a laugh, you really won't go wrong seeing the Internship.  Recommended.",1369267200,57,1650,4.89568345323741

5857249,5,B00DV1XYTO,"When I first saw the trailers for this movie on Youtube, I must admit that I had my doubts about this movie.  I was afraid that this movie was going to go the same route that one comedy too many have gone all through this century with cheap gross-out jokes and juvenile approaches to humor.  Thankfully quite the contrary is the case with this movie.  This movie proved to be hilarious based on it being well written, well edited, having strong comedic timing, giving everyone in it a chance to be funny, having two main characters that are not only very relatable, but also, they're both really easy to root for and to get behind.

This movie focuses on Billy McMahon(Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell(Owen Wilson) two best friends and salesman of whom both lose their jobs as they have fallen behind in the latest technology.  Nick tries taking a job at the mattress store that his obnoxious brother in-law(Will Ferrell) runs.  Soon after Nick takes that lousy job, Billy comes up with a very hopeful internship hopefully leading to a job with Google.  After the webcam interview shortly leading to their acceptance/enrollment they get pair up with a group of unpopular and stressed out tech savvy 20 something kids that are rude and disapproving them at first.  Besides the five students that they are paired up with, Billy and Nick are soon introduced to their acid-tongued teacher Mr. Chetty(Aasif Mandvi), a beautiful and sexy teacher that Nick is interested in(Rose Byrne), and a total a**hat of which their team is competing against named Graham(Max Minghella).

Owen Wilson delivers on his usual comedy gold as he proves both charismatic, charming, zany, and hilarious.  Vince Vaughn proves to be not only a loyal friend and sidekick but also really great at his hilarious and well timed reactions and offering perfect one-liners.  Both of them together deliver on the perfect comedic timing, playing off eachother, chemistry, and they bring alot of humor to ordinary scenarios.  Both Tiya SIrcar and Rose Byrne prove charming, funny, likable, beautiful, and really smokin' hot.

My only complaints about this movie are that one scene of gratuitous violence where they end up offending a wheelchair bound man that they were told was Professor Xavier.  While I appreciate the X-Men reference, not only was that scene entirely unneccessary, but it was a little bit crude.  Usually a pointless scene like that ends up a deleted scene.  Also, I hated how rude many of the other characters were to the two Billy and Nick.  At least the conflict lead to something, to be fair.

All in all, this movie offers a breadth of great jokes with no nonsense casting, writing, and snappy comedic timing.  The main characters are both likable, relatable, charming, make cool references to the 80's, and their so incredibly hilarious with this sarcasm, comedic-timing, and comebacks.  Best of all this movie, rather than rely on gross-out humor, pushing the envelope, and fart jokes, it instead relies on strong writing, character development, great acting, and just an overall feel good attitude making you want more.  If you're into the older comedies like Ghostbusters, Stripes, Caddy Shack, Fast Times at Ridgmont High etc. then this is one great comedy that you won't want to miss.  10 stars out of 10!!!  A MUST SEE!!!",1488585600,,3314,4.931531531531531

5857280,5,B00DV1XYTO,"I was hesitant to seeing this movie because I've seen ""Wedding Crashers"" and my thoughts that this would be a sequel to that.  Hollywood is known for making bad sequels to movies and I guess I fell into that category of type casting these two actors.  Quite the contrary!  My son and I watched this movie and enjoyed it from start to finish.  Vince Vaughn did an excellent job on the writing of this movie.

These characters have an angle in this movie worth noting even in our day-to-day stress of work and/or working long hours.  I enjoyed there upbeat attitudes on life and how they dealed with today's millennial's in there digital world.  There is something to smile about in just about every scene.  The Harry Potter games played where the two main characters didn't know how the game was played. The dating scene with Owen Wilson still makes me smile thinking about it.  His character had high points for me with his positive innuendo remarks to the other characters and his friend in the movie.

When watching movies in general they almost always start out really good, then halfway through it something bad has to happen and it's something BIG that goes wrong and the story takes different turn for the worst then ya feel you made a mistake watching it.  I admit, I was waiting for the ""Bad"" part to show up and when it did, it didn't take the movie in spiral down turn to regret.

This is a movie worthy of buying. ",1480723200,,1425,4.498054474708171

5857442,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Witty dialogue. Likable characters. Relatable situations. A compelling, cohesive plot. Great acting. You will find absolutely none of those in evidence in this film.

Look, I like a goofy buddy comedy as much as the next person. But this movie is really not funny. It's painful to watch. The dialogue is neither funny nor realistic. I didn't hear a single clever thing in the entire time I watched it: no clever wordplay, original jokes, nothing. Just a little typical crude humor that's possibly funny if you're drunk or 13 years old. Will Ferrell's and Assif Mandvi's performances in this movie do not even help. I don't even know how it's possible to make these two people not be funny, so that's a real achievement. The romantic subplot feels tacked on. Never mind that the two moronic protagonists would never be hired at Google to begin with, not in a million years. This movie is about an hour and a half too long. I made it about 40 minutes before I gave up.

If you want to watch an incredibly generic, predictable comedy with actors with a known schtick (because Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson just play the same character they play in every single other movie they have been in), then this might be worth your time. Otherwise, your time might be better spent re-watching something like Dumb and Dumber, Super Troopers, something with Adam Sandler in it, or How I Met Your Mother reruns. Heck, picking your belly button lint is time better spent than watching this movie.",1448668800,,1479,4.706563706563706

5857451,1,B00DV1XYTO,"These two guys---Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson are such great actors, and they do so well together. I don't understand why they have based themselves (again) to appear in such a one-dimensional, predictable spoof about nothing.

Every character in this film except Will Ferrell and the chick Owen Wilson is chasing has exactly the same snarky self-righteous personality. That kind of character depth surely deserves an academy award of some kind---just not THE Academy Awards. Luckily Will Ferrell steps in to save the film from obtaining a single positive comment, by evoking his gift of spewing out potty-mouthed dialog with such conviction that Linda Lovelace would cringe!

It's not the worst I have ever seen---let's not forget the ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", but ""The Internship"" certainly gives it a run for its money.

The movie is actually really lighthearted, entertaining and genuinely touching at some points. In that regard, if you want to watch a random comedy with the family then this would be a good option. However, with that being said, make sure you get this straight: it's definitely an advertisement for Google and I completely agree with other reviewers here how strange that they can make a movie out of what is essentially a long commercial for Google. It's plainly a cutthroat internship movie and if you were expecting any plot twists or turns you will be disappointed.

I think the premise of the movie was cute enough, but it's really slow to get going.  You keep waiting for something to happen, and you wait a very long time.  For some reason 2 guys working for Google when they don't know a thing about coding, etc was almost a little annoying for some reason.  It was too unbelievable even for a Hollywood movie.  The characters were all likeable and well played - except for the antagonist of course, who we both hated yet the actor who played the part of the jerk did it very well.",1445126400,,647,4.095238095238095

The film is a cute comedy that points out that genius coders don't necessarily know everything, and that with age does tend to come some wisdom. Plenty of laughs to make the movie worth watching. And the scenes that show off Google's many well-known perks are enough to make most people envious of the life that Googlers experience each day. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see more techie stuff, and I thought the bad guy role was a bit over the top. It's a good rental (which is how I viewed it on Amazon Prime), and if you're a Vaughn or Wilson fan, probably decent to add to your collection.",1444867200,,698,4.376923076923077

The story is developed really badly, every scene is like the previous, same structure, different topic.

A long and stupid Google promotion, under the thin guise of a  plodding and sophomoric comedy.  Two losers somehow get internships with Google and are consigned to the brilliant, yet nerdy outcasts to develop a project where the winners get full time jobs with Google.  It's never explained how these non-paid interns survive in the San Francisco area, but the heroic efforts of the good, multi-racial and liberal group of misfits are pitted against the evil, white group of elitist preps.  Guess who comes out on top?  I can't remember hating a movie so much as this piece of propaganda dreck.  I've been using Bing since.",1436745600,,706,4.785123966942149

5857555,3,B00DV1XYTO,"Before seeing this movie via my cable provider, I must say I was looking forward to the reunion of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (since their other film ""Wedding Crashers""). ""The Internship"" deals with adults seeking employment, which is identical to almost all people living in real life. This movie portrays real situations where adults get laid-off or terminated from their jobs and then must find employment but end up competing in an (unpaid) internship to secure a job (in this movie, with the most popular company on this planet, Google). Yes, there were a lot of funny scenes, but most of this movie fell flat. However, hearing Alanis Morisette's song ""Ironic"" at the begining of this film brought back memories from the 90's... Anyway, the obviously memorable scenes were inside Google's buildings in Northern California (whether or not it's identical to the real Google's headquarters, I don't know). ""The Internship"" could have been better and was not as big a hit as ""Wedding Crashers"". However, the important (yes, I said important) scene in ""The Internship"" was of the online video interview between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and the two interviewers working with Google. The one ridiculous but interesting question ""If you were shrunk to the size of a nickel and in a blender, what would you do?"" (or something to that effect) is a question that seems would be asked in reality by Google and the question's preposterous question makes you ""think outside the box"" (or in this case, outside the blender), but is no surprise since most hiring managers want to ""weed out"" interviewees or job applicants. Is it fair and reasonable? Like cold, rational-minded people who have no sympathy and empathy say, ""that's life"". Bottom line: Is ""The Internship"" worth watching? Yes, because it mirrors applying for jobs in reality. No, because it was not as entertaining as ""Wedding Crashers"".",1435104000,,1895,5.038216560509555

With this unrated version there was some nudity so if you are watching with younger kids I would definitely make sure you fast forward  - there is some overall sexual content but nothing too insane or outrageous.  I watched it with my high school age sons and fast forwarded through the nudie bar scenes which were unnecessary in my opinion and still enjoyed the movie.  (My sons wouldn't have minded watching that part but yeah not with their mom in the room LOL).  Overall it was a really good comedy - I love Vince Vaughn and he played his usual over talkative character really well.  I don't know if getting hired at Google is really like that but the Quidditch match alone made me want to work there!

5857590,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Love this movie - a fun, no-brainier with the obligatory bad guy trying to to ruin our interns chances. Great main character chemistry, and quite a plug for Google!  Two middle-aged, white screw-ups who grew up in the 80s trying to compete with 21st-century college kids and their computer-savvy world.  Their heart-warming lessons in life, teamwork, and ordinary social skills win the day, of course.

Spoiler alert - Several laugh-out-loud scenes involving an intramural Quidditch competition, and the creation of an absolutely genius, real-world App to block sexting and drunk-dialing are hilarious highlights.",1432684800,,613,5.56989247311828

5857592,3,B00DV1XYTO,"Quirky, but really nothing new here. In fact it's a rather forgettable film that follows a formula and sinks to trashy depths at times to try and get some laughs. Okay for some marginal entertainment when there's nothing else to watch.",1432252800,,235,4.7560975609756095

5857599,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Classic movie, my stomach hurt from laughing so much.  It's worth seeing just for the one scene where they have a question and answer period with the head of the internship program.",1431561600,,181,4.65625
5857600,3,B00DV1XYTO,It was fun to see the inside of Google and to see that older people (35?) are still relevant. Just a little too predictable that;s all.,1431388800,,135,4.230769230769231

5857602,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Great movie full of good laughs.  If your cat that you've had for 15 years is super crazy sick, like throwing up really nasty stuff and unable to control its bathroom situation, then you should watch this, because this movie will remind you that even though your best friend may pass on at any moment, life still goes on, and watching Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn try to get a job at Google is hilarious.  Campy, yes, but hilarious.  So, watch this movie, enjoy it.  And good luck with your cat, I know how you feel.",1431302400,,516,4.34375

I'm an IT person myself and it was very interesting to see the dynamics between the young programmers & Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson's characters develop overtime.

I like Owen Wilson but am indifferent to Vince Vaughn so I did not have high expectations but found the Google Work Place setting interesting since I have seen that Google Campus.
One review said that it was a movie all the family could watch. I guess it depends on your family. It included a long scene at a night club with lap dancers, etc.  Just a warning depending on the age of your family.
The movie itself was enjoyable. It had some good laughs and even some touching moments. Actually it was much better than I had expected... Not great but had enough fun moments to justify the time spent watching it.",1423180800,,753,4.456521739130435

5857716,5,B00DV1XYTO,Great movie lots of laughs.  Classic Vince Vaughn comedy.  The dynamic duo from the wedding crashers did it again.  I would highly recommend.

5857720,4,B00DV1XYTO,"WHO can resist watching another comedy with the dynamite combination of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (a la Wedding Crashers)?  I couldn't!  While the laughs may not be non-stop, it's a generally amusing and upbeat film, even if somewhat formulaic.

Some called them ""dinosaur salesmen"" (yeah like their boss, John Goodman).  They aren't really quite dinosaur salesmen, just salesmen from a generation not saturated with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or even, it would seem, all that much of Google, let alone possessing any programming skills.  As the film begins they are headed for a sale, over a nice dinner, of an expensive line of watches to a retailer.  And they definitely could use a good sale.  The two ply their best verbal skills, bouncing off each other, babbling pseudo-serious philosophy, hard sell, and hilarious observations to the potential client (excellently played by Gary Williams, who we never see again).  Williams then compliments them and observes that he really enjoys talking to them and likes their products too, but unfortunately he can't order any from them since THEIR COMPANY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS---d'oh!

The boss didn't even have the decency to tell them before they headed out on this dinner-sale quest.  This was a clever way to start the film and a twist I don't recall seeing before--the kind of insult in the business world, comparable to being dumped by a significant other with a TEXT MESSAGE or something...  Soon after, they are on a park bench commiserating about what a s***ty deal life has handed them and putting all that in the MOST EXPLICIT terms when they suddenly notice, one bench over, a mother with a young child, not at all appreciating this language.  Vaughn, in his best schmoozing style, tries to mitigate the damage and only makes things worse.  I think this was actually the funniest scene in the whole movie and it really had me laughing hard (though others may find some other scene the best).

Owen starts working for a jerk (played by Will Farrell) whom he can't stand and who treats him rudely, while Vince looks online for other sales jobs.  This is when he has his REVELATION--about their applying to Google as INTERNS--which requires them to be COLLEGE STUDENTS for one thing, so he immediately enrolls them both in the University of Phoenix online, which henceforth he pronounces to anyone who will listen and even those who don't, as ""The Harvard of the Online Education World""

There follows a hilarious online interview with a Google panel which they are forced to do at a computer at the public library, since neither has a computer with a webcam...and they are repeatedly bothered during the interview by kids who also want to use the machine since there's a 15 minute time limit per person....not to mention the questions from the Google panel that they have no idea how to answer....

For the movie to continue, obviously Google has to take them on as interns despite their severe lack of fitting in.  Somewhat like elite colleges, Google apparently prides itself on not getting cast into a single mode and picking a bright but diverse workforce to maximize innovation, which is how they get in since, compared to everyone else at Google, clearly they are ""diverse"".

From there the rest is fairly predictable: Interns are split into teams and nobody wants them on their team; they are left with a team assembled from leftovers, the whole thing looks hopeless, and somehow they will have to turn it all around (mainly by getting a bunch of  very bright but very introverted and quirky teammates to actually function as a team instead of one-upping each other, using the ONE skill they perfected in their lives: the art of bulls***ting andschmoozing.

I thought it was funny and harmless.  A couple of characters provide some tame romantic interest, and some of the Google staff seem (at least to an outsider) to be sort of spot-on.  When you just wanna be entertained, check it out",1416787200,,3957,4.873134328358209

5857781,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I had no desire to see Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson yuck it up in another bromance, so I avoided THE INTERNSHIP.  But recently I ran across it on cable, and although the two actors did their best to chase me away playing annoying salesmen Billy and Nick during the first half hour of this film, I was paid dividends by hanging in there.  While neither is tech savvy, they BS their way into two internships at mega-online presence Google.  (And their web cam intern interview is akin to 9-inch nails on your 3rd grade teacher's chalkboard.)  But once Google becomes the setting for THE INTERNSHIP, the plot turns on its high tech charm; Billy and Nick have twenty years on the rest of the Google interns, yet they possess what the youngsters do not:  life experience.  All the interns are divided into 5-member teams, mentored by a Google nerd.  The teams compete with one another in various activities (e.g., designing their own App, or manning the Google Hot Line for one hour); the grand prize for the winning team:  fulltime employment at Google.

Once Team Lyle's (Josh Brener) collection of 5 misfits is put together (Wilson, Vaughn, Dylan O'Brien, Tobit Raphael, and a sizzling Tiya Sircar), the funniest moments of this film begin.  Barring the annoying brainstorming sessions, when Billy and Nick distract their teammates with downright nonsense, Team Lyle comes together to show why their ""Googlyness is off the charts"".  Granted, the two oldtimers are often in the way, yet they help their younger charges to search for themselves and find much-needed self-esteem.  Whether it's spending a rowdy night at a Gentlemen's Club, or making a spot on sales pitch to a set-in-his-ways pizza shop owner, Team Lyle follows the lead of Nick and Billy, who have thoroughly been through the school of hard knocks.  And that's when THE INTERNSHIP is at its most charming; look for the typical butterflies and kittens ending, but with a bit of an edge.

I enjoyed the supporting cast, including Rose Byrne in a comparably small role as Nick's romantic interest; Aasif Mandvi as Mr. Chetty, who is in charge of the intern program; a soft-spoken Josh Gad as the nerdy head of Google Search; Max Minghella as Graham, a ruthless, ethnically challenged intern competitor; and Eric Andre as Sid, another Google nerd.  And there's no missing Will Ferrell or John Goodman in small, uncredited roles.  Yes, Wilson and Vaughn threaten to sabotage THE INTERNSHIP as the film begins, yet as the closing credits role you'll have a grin on your mug, and you'll realize you've been warmly charmed.

5857782,5,B00DV1XYTO,"This movie has mediocre reviews, but I love it so much.
I've watched it several times, and then I saw it in the bargain bin on AMAZON, and I just had to have it!
I think it clicks more being that I'm a member of the IT world, but it's still relatable to your every day movie goer.

Check this out, and look past some of the tech jargon.
Owen, and Vince make a pretty good team.

There are some forced comedic moments, as with most comedies of the modern day.
Those too stupid to really be funny, or trying too hard attempts are pretty few and far between, and could've been left out, but....
some might fight that humor likable.

anyways.

This movie was fun and kept a smile on my face and in my heart for the most part. I could relate to the young hipsters and to ""the two old guys"". Some of the movie was sorely based in fantasy, but I could tell the difference between fact and falsehood. I wish I had one of those privacy nap pods in my house, better yet, at my school's library. School libraries definitely should stock them, especially the ones open 24/7.

This movie was mostly about camaraderie, never giving up, human decency and dignity (esteem) - all great soft skills to have in today's job market. What the movie said was true, today's job market is not like our parents'. I think I read somewhere that instead of one lifelong job, people will have several careers in their lifetimes. You might as well make friends, or at least be cordial to the people you see on a day-to-day basis, because you never know.

5857796,5,B00DV1XYTO,"This was simply a fantastic movie.  I really watched it with no expectations as I'm not overly familiar with either actor but know of them.  A coworker brought up the movie to me one day when we were talking about Skype interviews and he sent me a video clip of this scene from this movie.  I was sold and then rented it.  Best 2 hours of entertainment I've seen in a long time and even bought the movie.  The song scene in the very beginning made me laugh outloud and it had a truly awesome ending!  I will say that unless you grew up in the 80s recognizing the references to the movie, ""Flashdance"" I don't think you'd appreciate the movie as much as those of us who did! :)

I thought the movie showed heart, taking chances, not giving up on your dreams, and how people can come together even if there is diversity.  I liked all the characters and actors in the movie - it was very well cast and the storyline and script were great.

I don't get tired of watching it time to time only because there is a lot of funny material in this movie and some fast talking - so every time I watch it I pick up on something different.

Everyone has their own taste in movies, so others may not agree with my opinion, but my thought after watching this one now a couple of times is it is a definite five stars.  I laughed throughout the movie and absolutely thought the ending was stellar.  But again, I do think I found it super funny in some places in the movie because I grew up in the era of the movie, Flashdance, so appreciated the humor and references.",1407024000,,1549,4.195945945945946

If you do, then you need to get some new friends.  This movie was terrible.  It had way too much Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson banter.  They spend almost the entire movie getting 18-25 year olds to like them.  Some of you may have flashbacks from when your parents tried to do the very same thing.  So if you find yourself considering watching this movie, do yourself a favor.  Don't.

Shockingly, we actually watched it again during the rental period, which rarely happens for us.  Some of the plot is ridiculous & predictable, but it was just so fun to watch we didn't mind.

Both decided to change careers after they had a hard time looking for job and decided to try their luck as interns at Google.

I was expecting a great movie similar to the Wedding Crashers. Unfortunately,that wasn't the case as most of the comedic scenes could barely elicit any laughter to the viewers. One probably has to be in the Information Technology industry to appreciate the humor in it. Added to that,this had themes that are far from original and refreshing as it tried to rehash the ""underdog"" theme that is similar to the Rocky franchise and it also provides us how two people who knew nothing about computers ended up being employees at Google and how they helped their fellow geeky team members to appreciate life more than work and instill self-confidence in them.

the dialogue is fine tuned, funny, witty, and playful.  nothing feels over done or trying to out do a prior movie (like they were trying to live up to wedding crashers or be better than wedding crashers).

the plot is believable and the ending isn't some super happy sugar coated hollywood ending.  it's somewhat realistic and their is an interesting twist at the end.

The plot is what you'd expect from a Vince Vaughn movie: cheeky and optimistic with the good guy prevailing at the end. The characters are likable, but the overall premise is a bit far fetched. Still, it's easy to get lost in the idea of working for Google. Their campus is spectacular, and their corporate culture is wholly unique. It's a good movie to sit back and enjoy with the family, although most of the 'nightclub' scene can be argued as not appropriate for minors.",1395446400,,554,4.55

While it defiantly has some good moments here and there, this is a very predictable and forgettable comedy.

As many have said, it is a bit hard to get past all of the Google product placement in the film. Vaughn and Wilson are good, but this really felt a the kind of comedy that should've been released in the 80's. The plot is predictable and cheesy. Also, there is no reason this film needed to be 2 hours. It was way too long and got boring after a while. Not really a good comedy even though it had some funny moments.

You can guess the entire plot of the movie, yes, the whole thing, based on the title, but, still pretty funny in spite of its short comings. Prepare for standard Owen Wilson sarcastic humor, one extremely drawn out, over the top unnecessary for this film night club scene, and a dash of crude sex humor that is also not to my taste and you will know what you're getting in for in this film.

That said, I wasn't expecting much here: some low-brown humor, some stereotypes of nerds/geeks, google/silicon valley, and underdog succeeding in the end, despite the odds.

Well... it delivered on all of the above, but in a surprisingly painless way.

There are some somewhat interesting side characters (the too-young manager desperately trying to make friends, the nerds who have had no life experience, the homeschooled kid who's been browbeaten by his mother) as well as the typical plot complications/stereotypes: the expected/unexpected love interests and match-ups the crescendo fight at just the expected time, etc And of course, the typically over-exaggerated supposed-to-be-funny-scenarios (a Quidditch-mock-up match, a stripper-bar-fight)

In the end, things end up as predicted, but you know, no one watches a movie like this for the sense of surprise, right?

I watched the movie because I like the actors involved and my husband wanted to watch it. I didn't expect to like it, and I liked it... slightly more than I was expecting.

The Vaugh/Wilson combo works to some extent, even if everyone has seen it before.  This time, however, its even more unbelievable than Wedding Crashers, only slightly more believable than Starship Troopers, and inferior overall to both.

The biggest flaw, of course, is the tech piece of it all.  Sorry, but Ive talked my mother and father through a variety of mundane tasks on the computer, and its agonizing.  To think these guys would go from selling watches to competing with the best and brightest, young, tech minds is just ridiculous.  The competition in this movie are kids that have been programming in C++ since middle school.  It wouldnt just be unusual to them; it would be alien.  It doesnt matter how much BS they throw against the wall, or how eloquently they relay feel good aphorisms, it just wouldnt happen.

In the end, however, despite its flaws, The Internship still has some funny, albeit predictable moments.  Its worth a single viewing.

And for the love of cinema, can we please stop casting Owen Wilson as the guy who can land Rachel McAdams, Jane Seymour (if he wanted to), or Rose Byrne?",1393372800,,1267,4.873831775700935

5857983,4,B00DV1XYTO,"First, I want to say that when these two get together, they always end up with a great movie that to me is just hilarious.  I like the fact that they made a movie about how if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.  I also like how it went the way of the ""Techi"", as I love gadgets and I am an Android man and also a Chromebook owner.  The streaming was done on my PS4 and it looked great!  Amazon has stepped up their game in terms of streaming quality as of late.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes this duo or just loves funny, feel good movies.",1393286400,,570,3.9649122807017543

5857994,3,B00DV1XYTO,"See there were these two guys who had an agenda, a clever line of spiel, a back and forth repartee and patter with the women, and could sell whatever there was to sell, in selling themselves. And successfully jumping into various and sundry beds as a result. Oh, no that was the Wedding Crashers not the film under review, The Internship. Well, wait a minute, maybe that synopsis is not so far off as this pair, Vince Vaughn (who co-wrote this one) and Owen Wilson (the pair playing modern day Mutt and Jeff, Abbott and Costello, etc. etc.) once again team up to give a funny pair of performances which kept the thinness and commonality of the plot-line from causing us all to go into a stupor.  These guys can apparently save anything with their antic hay humor.

Okay, lets try again. See there are two guys, two guys who can sell anything while selling themselves, who become unemployed by virtue of their company going under. What to do. Well why not go from just your average low- tech middle-aged joes to try out life in the land of high- tech. And the culture of high- tech chosen (and on display) is none other than at Google out in sunny California. Except you just don't walk in and grab some job on your resume there (at least in this film) but must run the gauntlet by serving an internship filled with all kinds of funny tasks, including team-building, for the few available jobs. Well you know our two boys are nothing but low-tech guys so they would fail themselves and their motley of teammates if it was only techie stuff but they bring their version of shoulder-to-the-wheel-think-out-of-the-box in to save the day. And mercifully save this film with their flat-out slap-stick hi-jinx that made even this low-tech guy laugh a few times. No, many times.",1393027200,,1770,4.6158730158730155

5857997,3,B00DV1XYTO,"I enjoyed the Internship for comic relief. The only problem I found with this movie is, yet again, I cannot watch with my teen girls.

They do not disappoint even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over again. Sort of like wedding crashers who now have to go out and get real jobs.

Let's face it- the camera loves the John Wayne-esque Vince Vaughn. He always tends to come across as the heroic awkward giant with the gentle heart. Wilson mugs a little too much and is beginning to show his age. Maybe he needs a haircut. Who knows?

It's not as deep as Wedding Crashers but if you want a comedy with a feel good ending, then buy this movie and be happy.",1392854400,,660,4.23015873015873
5857999,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Not highbrow art, but also not in the toilet humor.  This is a good movie with a lot of strong comedy and fun.  There is one racy scene in a strip club but it's more of a backdrop than a centerpiece and doesn't distract from the plot too much.  The end result is like a summer beach book.  Something you can easily consume without heartburn and have a good time but not something that is going to change your life.",1392854400,,414,4.1375

Of particular interest was the pizza shop, Rocky Bottom that the gang does the contract with.  The funny thing about it is it's not even the best pizza place on that block (Antico is).  Of course, in the movie they talk about how the pizza is so good because the owner goes to the farmer's market every day.  I can assure you, this is not the case.",1392681600,,492,4.247311827956989

5858030,5,B00DV1XYTO,"For my fiance and I we were both young adults during the 90s, but still young enough to be involved in the technology bloom of the 21st century. It made the move extra enjoyable as there were both nostalgic moments, and sympathies to both sides.

As you would expect with Vince and Owen the movie was hilarious. There was never a dull moment, and it all varied on a scale of poking fun at real life serious situations to trying to catch a snitch by his ""ball"".

On that note I'm not sure how this rates for kids, but I'm guessing a strip club scene is probably a deal breaker for most parents.

Still the characters were hilarious and 3D, very relateable. A great movie for the youngadult crowd. Aside from the general theme of comedy there was also a great underlying message that if you work hard enough you can achieve anything, even in today's economy and job rates.

Back in 2005, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson starred in the summer hit, Wedding Crashers. In addition to being a commercial success, the film also received some generally positive reviews, most of which praised Vaughn and Wilson's on-screen chemistry. It's no secret that both have seen their fair share of roles since then, but I always found it strange that the industry failed to capitalize on the potential of these two men. Fast-forward eight years later and that second film finally materialized in the form of The Internship, a simple comedy that focuses on the relationship of best friends Billy McMahon (Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Wilson). I was interested in seeing how the film would avoid feeling gimmicky, but this is perhaps the only aspect of The Internship I shouldn't have been worried about.

After finding out their company has been shut down, salesmen Billy and Nick find themselves in need of employment. Both have very few skills outside of sales, and neither is a college graduate, so they wind up in a bit of a conundrum. To make matters worse, Billy's house is being foreclosed, and his girlfriend, Megan (Joanna Garca), just left him. Sick of living life check-to-check, and appalled by the idea of working at some random job he'll hate, Billy decides to sign the both of them up for an internship at Google. After convincing Nick to join him, the two friends take part in the internship program in Santa Clara County, California. Along the way, they make some unexpected friends, and the audience gets to see both men grow spiritually even though they're surrounded by a bunch of 20 year-olds.

If there's one thing The Internship does extremely well, it would be providing consistent laughs for the entirety of its two hour running time. Vaughn and Wilson slipped into these roles as if they were an old pair of shoes, and their chemistry is once again felt throughout the entire film. In fact, it didn't take long before the first laugh escape from my mouth. As Billy and Nick come into frame for the first time, the viewer can hear ""Ironic"" by Alanis Morissette playing on the car stereo. This prompts Nick to ask, ""What the s*** is this? Why is this on the Get Psyched mix?"" A fair question, and a great opening line for a movie; however, it is the way this scene plays out that really brings in the laughter, and its execution is nothing short of hysterical.

As the story progresses, and Billy and Nick begin adjusting to Google and the life of a Noogler--a term used to describe the interns--the stronger material comes into play once it starts to involve their personal team of outcasts. There's the team manager, Lyle (Josh Brenner); the edgy-kid, Stuart (Dylan O'Brien); the smart, yet insecure female, Neha (Tiya Sircar); and the odd, yet highly intelligent Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael). Six very different people who probably wouldn't be together in any other situation, but these three young interns soon learn that Billy and Nick have a lot to offer even with their obvious lack of technological experience. One of my favorite bits comes from an interaction between Billy and Lyle. As Billy continuously mispronounces it, ""On-the-line,"" Lyle irritably, and continuously, corrects him with a soft, ""Online.""

However, the comedy wasn't always spot-on, and I found that the writers tried too hard to include too many different forms of comedy, even though all of them clearly didn't work together. One of the best examples would be from the first challenge of the internship. Every team was given the task of debugging a program, and the first team to find the error won the challenge. This is where Billy and Nick truly displayed their ignorance and, in my opinion, nothing about this segment was particularly funny. In fact, it kind of bordered on annoying, and I honestly wanted it to be over as soon as possible. As Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha tried their hardest to figure it out, Billy and Nick were spouting nonsense on the sidelines, and it was tough to watch. It segued into funny bit involving ""Professor Xavier,"" but the journey to get to that point was rough.

Where the film really falls flat, though, is its inherent ability to display every buddy-comedy cliche in the book. There's the group of friends who have hit rock bottom with nowhere to go, there's the awkward group of people who learn to love each other, there's that one person who makes their life hell, and there's the leader who secretly believed in them the entire time. I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Cliches can be okay if they are done tastefully, and if they aren't used as a way to structure a film's plot, but neither statement is applicable to The Internship. It doesn't just include these cliches; it embraces them. It puts them on the front line and says, ""Hey! Look at this unoriginal plot progression!""

Taking all of that into consideration, it's surprising just how much I found myself enjoying every bit of this movie. It has its flaws, sure, but they never became unbearable. The film seems to coast on the fact that Vaughn, Wilson, and the rest of the supporting cast have such amazing chemistry, which makes it extremely difficult not to have a good time. There are no groundbreaking performances, there are no extraordinary story elements, and a few of the recurring jokes could have been toned down a little, but the movie sets out to be fun, and it excels in this regard. Plus, the audience gets to see some very small performances from Will Ferrell, Rob Riggle, and Aasif Mandvi, and these men steal the spotlight whenever they appeared on screen.

Overall Score: 7.6/10 - The Internship is far from perfect, and its story could have used a little more originality, but it's fun. At the end of the day it's an entertaining comedy that provides a lot of laughs, and its two leads are a joy to watch together. They both gave their usual performances, so neither broke any ground here, but it worked for the story being told. As a whole, it's definitely not something that's going to connect with everyone due to its cliched nature, but it's at least worth the rental if you're on the fence.",1391385600,,6221,4.753703703703704

5858222,2,B00DV1XYTO,"Unfortunately you should really wait for The Internship to appear on TV rather than waste any money to see it.  I wasn't expecting it to be brilliant and since Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn always play the same characters in every single film they are in, I wasn't expecting that aspect to change.  But I did expect it to be a bit funnier, I thought there would be a bit more of the fish out water, generation conflict, technophobes vs those who grew up with a passion for it.  Alas, pretty much all the scenes which were even slightly funny were shown in this film's previews.  Why did a film where we know the guys are going to be working at Google on an Internship take just under half an hour for them to walk onto the organisation's campus?  The first half hour was pretty boring stuff and added nothing to the film and really should have been edited down to a few minutes.  The movie goes for about two hours with the slow start included.

Once at Google it become a formulatic piece of younger, smarter interns seeing the two high school finished at most, and that was decades ago, interns as a joke.  Teams competing for a guaranteed job (doesn't seem the smartest way to hire people), with the left over interns overlooked by everyone else left to team up with the two ""old guys"" and of course not being thrilled with the situation.  Throw in your stereotypes of an Asian young guy with a strict upbringing and demanding mother, an Indian girl who doesn't see herself as much of a catch for the opposite sex, and the jerk who isn't afraid to point out he doesn't want them on his team.  Then you've the ""bad guy"" lead team where an up himself rich kid constantly puts down his team mates and of course the two old guys in the opposition. I never understood why his team mates joined his team in the first place, especially the girl ""you're in as your hot"".  This movie's plot was pretty much a remake of the plot of the cartoon film, Monsters University, which itself had been done a million times before.

Parts of the plot there for the gag such as the red and green paddles didn't flow into the rest of the movie as we've got Wilson's character trying to getting a date with one of the teacher type Google employees as a subplot after one of the paddle questions forbid that as part of company policy.  Yet he is never even given a warning about it, when numerous Google employees observe this.  I found the boys' supposedly being top salesmen in their former career, then when given the opportunity to shine with those skills was just a big letdown.  Can't really go into that more without giving away spoilers.  I have to say I never really at any time ever bought the plausibility of them actually getting an internship at Google, but thought if somehow this had happened for these characters, they'd bring a lot more fish out of water laughs, then they delivered.

Borrow it from your library or wait for it to be on TV but I wouldn't part with any money to watch it, it's simply a watchable once, but average film.",1390348800,,3030,4.41113105924596

5858227,2,B00DV1XYTO,More of a drama than comedy. This movie is 1 1/2 hour commercial for google. Nothing like wedding crashers in terms of comedy,1390348800,,125,4.478260869565218
5858228,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Warning: This movie is the worst for female objectification and Jr. High humor- it completely fails at being funny. Guess these actors wanted to buy a beach house and this movie was easy income. Story line: implausible and boring. Characters: cartoonish and stereotypical. Sexual themes and gross factor: Offensive & Sexist. Hope that your teenagers don't watch this - unless you think portraying going to a strip club with nerdy college kids as good, harmless fun.
Yes, they show grinding lap dancing and subsequent (yuck) accident, requiring the bathroom dryer to dry the pants. This scene is when we had to bail and turn it off. The Internship sucked!",1390348800,3,654,5.009174311926605

5858232,4,B00DV1XYTO,Better than expected.  The silly humor had a good message behind it and ultimately the movie finished with a pretty satisfying ending.  It was the same formula from Vaugn and Wilson but the delivery was spot on,1390262400,,210,4.648648648648648
5858233,1,B00DV1XYTO,This movie was a real disappointment. Slapstick comedy that relied on movies they had previously made. Just very very disappointing. I guess they must have needed the money very badly.,1390262400,,184,5.166666666666667

5858244,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Just like my title alludes to, I loved this movie. The plot doesn't set you up with very high hopes, the concept of two middle aged men working as interns at Google doesn't really strike anyone as movie gold, but ultimately it worked. The two leads proves to still be hilarious together and gave a dynamic where their friendship was believable. But what really shined in this movie was the supporting characters. Dylan o'brian of teen wolf fame was hilarious as the brooding Stuart. He has a career ahead of him, that one. Other than the kind of predictable plot points (underdogs coming out on top, guy gets the girl) this movie was a great watch and I fully intend to purchase the hard copy and watch it again.",1390003200,,712,4.5271317829457365

Two ""behind the times"" sales guys do an internship with Google when they get laid off. Very funny, we all catch ourselves quoting some of the lines!

5858277,2,B00DV1XYTO,"Haven't I seen this before? I thought I saw it on Billy Madison. Or maybe it was from Happy Gilmore. Or was it Old School? Dodgeball?

Oh wait, I think I know what's going on. Hollywood has already run out of ideas years ago and that's why they created The Internship. You know the story. A gang of misfits try to beat the odds in order to apprehend fortune and glory in the end. If you've seen most of Adam Sandler's movies, then you'll know what happens at the end. Basically, The Internship is an unoriginal comedy with numerous cliches that you would expect from this type of comedy. You have the annoying antagonist who does nothing but look down on the protagonists. You have the group of awkward misfits who don't even know how to socialize with a caterpillar. You have the positive message that you should never give up on your hopes and dreams (which isn't a bad thing, by the way). And then, you have the useless romantic subplot that doesn't add any real significant element in the plot.

In a nutshell, The Internship is bland and predictable fare. I will admit that I did find myself laughing at five or six jokes. And I didn't mind if this really was just ""Google propaganda"": at least Google does have some great qualities for the internet. So it wasn't a complete loss. However, this movie is nothing new. I'm sick and tired of the same old formula. Makes me feel so uncertain about comedies these days.

Everything after is downhill. Predictable, including an extremely over-extended party scene montage, various predictable romantic relationships, and plenty of bad editing. Really typical characters, like the super-cranky boss, the over-sexed college girl, under-sexed college boy, and the Vince Vaughn.
Anyway, the worst parts were definitely the fact that it was a super long Google infomercial, and all the female characters were sex objects, even the ones who were ""intelligent"". Also, nowhere in the movie does one female speak to another female. So dumb.",1388966400,,733,5.3826086956521735

A night of extreme drinking and scantily clad women led to an epiphany. To me this glorified a side of life to people at an impressionable point in life.  This could have been a different situation that don't sacrifice personal morals and virtuous behavior, and still been funny and entertaining if it had been more intelligently written.

5858365,4,B00DV1XYTO,"This is a charming and often very funny movie that's totally worth watching at least once, if not a few times. It's not as rip-roaringly funny as the best comedies of recent years, but the plot is entertaining, and several scenes are extremely funny, like when Vince Vaughn persists in suggesting his Google team develop Exchange-o-gram, a new photo posting service for use ""on the line"", and his 20-something colleagues keep pointing out he is essentially describing Instagram.

This was an excellent idea for a movie (partly Vaughn's) that was entertainingly carried. People who carp on Vaughn and Owen Wilson and think every comedy should be high drama will miss the point -- this is not an Academy-award winning drama, but it's a perfectly enjoyable comedy, and certainly one that's original in many ways.

If you're watching with kids: there's one sequence (easily anticipated) where Vaughn takes his office mates to an adult club, and that's a bit raunchy, but otherwise the movie's comparatively clean while being interesting for adults and older kids.",1388707200,,1059,5.115606936416185

5858368,3,B00DV1XYTO,"OK movie with some typical Vince Vaughn style action.  Hard to believe the story line that a hot chick at Google really has any interest in Owen Wilson.  The ending gets thrown together and the timeline doesnt' make sense but besides that, you get a few laughs as you would expect from this duo.",1388707200,,295,4.444444444444445
5858369,2,B00DV1XYTO,This movie would have been great if they would have just left out the porn scenes.  Both actors are good in this and other stuff they do but why do they always have to have porn added.  Says a lot about their own personal character that makes me twinge.  The computer world of employment was fascinating however.  It made me wonder if Google is actually like this!  If it is our world is really radically changing as far as employment environments go.  It leaves tons of room for employee creativity and free food at work that is really great!  I have never been to Google headquarters so I don't know how much of this was fiction on the part of the creators of the story line.  However it seems like a really great place to be and extremely challenging!  The one thing this movie did do was show how older adults still have a value and a purpose even in a world basically taken over by the young.  In that respect I enjoyed the fact that I am not the only older adult wondering if I can fit into this new era of technology.,1388707200,,1024,4.231958762886598

5858371,2,B00DV1XYTO,"I'm not sure what the point of this movie was.  It's made well and acted well.  Writing wise, it's very competently written.  The problem with this movie is that it seems like it would have been funny back in 2005 or if it skewered Google with a knockoff company as opposed to making a film that embraces it.  As it stands, this is your standard fish out of water story, with Wilson and Vaughn becoming interns not knowing a thing about technology and being dismissed by their peers.  I could tell you the end of the movie, but you probably already figured it out.  It's painfully predictable.  There are some good moments and Wilson and Vaughn have good chemistry, but the comedy is generally bland and the film seems out of touch with its core audience.",1388620800,,755,4.507352941176471
5858372,3,B00DV1XYTO,"It was funny, but no Wedding Crashers.  I found myself surfing the net and listening to the movie as opposed to actually watching it.

5858376,2,B00DV1XYTO,I love Owen Wilson and Tim Vaugn but this movie really did not come together. I think it was a combination of bad writing and an overall concept that although interesting was not really developed or just wasn't worth a whole movie. There were some laughs but I would recommend just skipping it and saving two hours of your life. I have to say that I really wanted to like this. I hope these guys choose better projects to work on in the future. I don't know how accurate it was of Google's culture but it did not make me like them much either and at the same time it was kind of an ad for Google. Strange,1388620800,,604,4.127118644067797

5858385,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Most of us can relate on some level to the foibles and failings of the main characters and that makes them lovable.  The way they encourage each other and their other team members during their internship and their loyal friendship, as well as their refusal to give up and settle, is something we should all aspire to.  It will leave you uplifted and wanting to pursue your dreams.

Was this Oscar material or a movie for the ages?  No.  But it's a good evening's entertainment when you want a comedy with an uplifting message.  I enjoyed it.",1388534400,,541,4.525773195876289
5858386,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Vince Vaughn, and Owen Wilson hit the jackpot with this movie, fricken hilarious from start to finish.  The humor, movie, jokes, and acting are fresh unlike most comedies these days.  This is not your gross out immature comedy filled with sex. nudity, inappropriate jokes, and foul language, but comedy at its best.  Earlier this year I purchased the big comedy of the summer, Were The Millers, after watching this one I was very disappointed, it is 2 hours of my life that I will never get back from watching this piece of crap movie.  The internship is at least 10 times better, and which is why I think this is one of the most under rated movies  of the year.  The movie is rated PG-13 but be warned the original version of the film contains Adult Language throughout, adult situations, some strong sexual content, and nudity.  Please note- this movie was done very tastefully.  So if its a rainy day or you just want to watch a movie, check it out.  TRUE COMEDY AT ITS BEST.",1388534400,,978,4.511363636363637

5858389,4,B00DV1XYTO,Actually I found it quite funny. It's an underdog story thus has you taLking for the underdogs.

This movie could almost be called wedding crashers part two as it reunites the same duo in the same vein of humor as the original Wedding Crashers. Although this story treads through familiar territory and is very predictable in its plot, it does have its moments of humor and is funny, although not as funny as Wedding Crashers. If you like the type of humor that Vaughn and Wilson brought into the WC movie then you will also enjoy the humor in this one.

5858473,1,B00DV1XYTO,"I don't think anything really made me smile quite as much as the year 2005, when Vince Vaughn realized that he was a really great comedian and that he should just steer clear of dramatics if he wanted to reignite his, at that time, pretty dead career.  His rebirth as an actor and celebrity is rare.  Usually, once youve passed your so-called prime, there is no turning back.  After that its straight to DVD releases and guest spots on television shows no one watches until you hit your 70s and then some young director takes pity on you, remembers you from their youth when you were interesting and decides to reboot your relevance by casting you as a salty grandpa in an Oscar contender and you wind up getting your 15 minutes of fame relatively close to your last 15 minutes on earth.

Not so with Vince Vaughn.

Sadly, since his resurgence, hes played it VERY safe and wound up playing very slight variations of the very same character in each and every one of his films.  Sometimes this works well, other times it makes for very uninteresting cinema.  A lot of this has to do with the script and the actors hes working with.

No matter how entertaining Vince can be, dull is dull.

But The Internship has another very big problem.

Some films annoy, not for the sake of anything other than annoyance.  That is how I felt while watching The Internship, as if this film had no other purpose than to be annoying from every possible angle.  The characters are ridiculous stereotypes that serve no other purpose than to spout banter that feels forced and contrived and unintelligent despite supposedly being an intelligent form of witty banter.  There are certain characters that leave such an awkward stamp on every frame they're in (Im looking at you Lyle) that the entire film feels like an exercise in patience.

The formula here is a tried and true one, and yet it is also one that nearly everyone has tried and botched and will try and botch again.  Billy and Nick are old dogs who need to learn new tricks in a world designed to cater to the young and gifted.  When they lose their jobs, their lives take a tumble and they wind up reaching for the stars when they apply for an internship at Google.  For some strange turn of events, they actually get the internship and from then on they defy odds and use their experience to teach their team of misfits all about strippers and booze and irresponsibility and overconfidence and BSing their way to the top, and they do, obviously.

Oh, and there is the overconfident British punk who berates them every step of the way.

The formula just doesnt work here.  Shawn Levy, the guy behind tighter offerings like Date Night and Cheaper by the Dozen, doesnt know how to make this movie work.  His script is a messy collage of Juno inspired banter that comes off as cheap and grating, and his cast of characters feel like overblown Saturday Night Live sketches.  Owen Wilson is looking more and more like a late in life lesbian and Vince Vaughn regurgitated shtick sticks out sorely in this film (hes also far too old to continually get cast alongside young, hot girls who would NEVER date a man like him unless he were a celebrity).  The horrible strip club scene is ten minutes too long (seriously, edit this movie) and the finale feels so contrived I wanted to throw someone at my own head for thinking that the names Vaughn and Wilson would guarantee a laugh or two.

The only laughs this movie got were those of the uncomfortable kind.",1387756800,14,3488,4.552884615384615

5858475,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Vince Vaughan should stick to acting if this as an example of his writing.  The dialogue for his character is incredibly bad and makes much of the film painful to watch.

5858488,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I think a lot of the critical reaction to this film stems from the fact that it isn't a sequel to ""Wedding Crashers"".  To me it plays like a throwback to the old slobs versus snobs or uncool versus the cool comedies like ""Caddyshack"" or ""The Revenge of the Nerds"".  No cinematic or comedic ground is broken here but the appeal of stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn goes a long way.  I can relate to the predicament of their characters growing up in an age when computers were the size of meat lockers and can now fit in the palm of your hand.  However, they can teach the young techno-geeks a lesson or two about a deal and a handshake.  Noteworthy is a cameo by Will Ferrell as a randy mattress salesman.  Film came out theatrically in the heighth of the Summer movie season and it goes down as smoothly as a cold beer.",1387497600,,820,4.258064516129032

5858493,1,B00DV1XYTO,"I have always enjoyed both main actors, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.  Even with their usual skills at performing in moderate to good comedy and other genre's, this sorely missed the mark.  I realize most comedy's are rarely that great and at best a couple laughs at least make up for the time and money spent watching.  However, if I could, I would want a complete refund and recommend no one spend the money to watch what will be a waste of time.  If you still feel the need to give it a try, wait for it to show up on Netflix, so at least you do not feel ripped off.
Not only was it extremely slow moving, much of the storyline could have been cut out, and it seemed to hold back Owen and Vince's ability to play up the opportunities to make it a comedy versus a miserable experience.
While it dragged on, the disparity between the ""older"" generation trying to assimilate into what is portrayed to be a still ""wet behind the ears"" group of co-workers was in my humble opinion way overplayed,  portrayed as completely impossible for them to overcome and even at the end, I could not buy into the idea that they had succeeded, overcome the odds.  As others have mentioned in their reviews it is predictable, and in my own case, I agree.  But even predictability can provide some form of humor.  This lacked it in spades.",1387411200,,1321,4.385245901639344

5858516,4,B00DV1XYTO,"This was a pretty good movie. It didn't have all the laughs you might expect from the Vaughn/Wilson pairing, but then again, they are older now, and this movie is about a couple middle aged men who are seeking a change from the grind that their lives have become. They basically, through a series of events, decide to enter the Google intern program to try and start a new career with Google. What they find is they are the only interns not in their late teens/early twenties, and their ability to relate to the younger mindset of the other interns and Google itself has suffered by virtue of their middle age. What ensues are funny moments where this comes heavily into play.
In a sense, while still a comedy, this move really does a great job of representing how middle age and questionable decisions leading to there can lead to a real mid life crisis, but also gives you the hope of finding a great way for that mid life crisis to be resolved.
A definite feel good movie where subtlety trumps quick laughs. I very much enjoyed it.",1387065600,,1034,4.476190476190476

I am really glad I decided to try it. I found it to be a fun, lighthearted movie. It was not overwhelmingly funny, but I did chuckle a few times and spent a good portion of the movie smiling.

I think the message is great and the movie is fun. Even though the premise of the movie is essentially a mid-life crisis based on the two main characters losing their jobs, they didn't dwell on that.  Instead of being emotionally dragged down into how awful such a situation could be, the movie does a good job of staying upbeat and treating it more as an opportunity than a tragedy.

I enjoyed this so much I might even buy the movie - and generally I don't buy movies because I usually won't watch them more than once.",1386979200,,813,4.1923076923076925

It is not needed in many cases, think about many people at your office, and you will see what they are doing didn't need 4 years of college or advance degree.  In other words the degrees have no value anymore in the market place.  It also shows technology can be learned even if you don't have a degree and adults with no skills can  have a second chance.

5858547,4,B00DV1XYTO,Funny movie. Vice and Owen play well off each other. Definitely a feel good type of movie. Would definitely watch again.,1386633600,,120,4.761904761904762

5858550,2,B00DV1XYTO,Movies takes a while to get going then when it does it's mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend renting this movie. What's happening with comedy these days?! Sigh...,1386547200,,165,4.928571428571429
5858551,3,B00DV1XYTO,"Owen and Vince are funny together no matter the movie. This movie had an unrealistic premise but still had some laughs.

5858552,2,B00DV1XYTO,"Unfortunately PG 13 is the new R and this movie unnecessarily teeters on X.  Noted due to several highly disturbing scenes that promote getting drunk and hedonistic sex.  Please also note that this is from a mother of two 14 year old boys.

I say the movie unnecessarily teeters on X which is a shame as the movie doesn't need the junk (or better yet, I would love to see a ""PG"" version of this movie - call it Google-ship or something and repack to families and I would buy it). There are multiple good aspects to this very funny movie, actors are very good as well.  Just beware and consider watching the movie first to note where you will need to fast forward for your family!  Overall, this movie makes me realize that I must be much more diligent and unfortunately what the world thinks of PG13 is simply more slippery slope.  Better safe than sorry!",1386547200,,855,4.414012738853503

5858561,3,B00DV1XYTO,"My wife and I watched this with one of our 14 year old sons. We thought it would be okay, since it was PG-13. We were surprised at the constant cursing and crude references. The movie would have been much better if they would have cut all that foul language. Not many people talk like that in real life. Why does Hollywood put that kind of language in movies these days. Very low class and trashy.",1386460800,,397,4.2368421052631575

5858567,5,B00DV1XYTO,fabulously funny. this combo of quirky interns reshaping outlier young adults makes for solid entertainment. Worth the rental. Available on redbox too.,1386374400,,151,5.909090909090909
5858568,5,B00DV1XYTO,I really thought this was going to be another buddy comedy...premise seemed so absurd...but I grew to love these guys...maybe because they represent my generation and our increasing feelings of being put out to pasture without much worth...but there is a worth to experience and these guys gut it through and show their value...and it's really out and out funny too...,1386374400,,368,5.049180327868853
5858569,5,B00DV1XYTO,"I thought this movie was hilarious. There were a couple times when I was experiencing secondhand embarrassment, but on the whole I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. Watching the two main characters struggle to learn new technology in a wildly different environment was funny. One of my favorite bits was their reaction to a game of Quidditch. An enjoyable movie, with a heartwarming ending.",1386288000,,403,4.9411764705882355

5858575,3,B00DV1XYTO,"Not as funny as I thought it might be, given the cast. Good movie though, and great insight to today's economy for new graduates. I would watch again. Just not as comedic as other movies with these stars.",1386201600,,204,4.394736842105263

Wouldn't waste my time or money again to see what I missed when I feel asleep...It was a total push for google and with the terrible acting and jokes that were not funny made this movie hard to even watch or want to get into. I would not recommend this movie!,1386115200,,360,4.231884057971015

I felt obligated to finish watching it because I paid for the rental, but I'd recommend passing on this film unless you have nothing better to do with your time.  Too bad, I really like Vince Vaughn.",1386028800,,358,4.235294117647059

5858589,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Guilty pleasure, because it is a rather silly, improbable, shmaltzy and almost formulaic movie, but darn it, those guys make me laugh.

5858590,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Bought the DVD, liked the movie. Came with the regular version (PG 13) and the unrated version. I had a suspicion that the unrated version would be raunchy(my daughter later told me not to ever watch the unrated version of anything), so I watched the PG 13 one. I really like Vince Vaughn, and I thought Luke Wilson was very good with him. Was not crazy about the night club scene.

5858594,1,B00DV1XYTO,The  movie is not funny only 5 minutes when they where in the mattress store. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money. The dialog is stupid and boring . I sold mine the day after what a waste of 15 dollars,1385942400,,212,3.8181818181818183

5858603,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Rambling is expected in a V.V. / O.W. film - it is the tax we willingly pay to witness their charm and occasional flash of comic brilliance... not here.  In ""The Internship"" the rambling just goes on and on with no point or humor.
I will watch V.V. do almost anything, but we stopped half way through the movie, after fast forwarding through the dull or embarrassing parts just landed us in more dull or embarrassing parts.",1385856000,,423,4.4935064935064934

We streamed the movie (and paid $5.99 to stream it) and the quality was not very good.  We've streamed numerous things in the past and this movie paused a few times.

5858632,3,B00DV1XYTO,Predictable story line but very funny.  It is typical Vaughn and Wilson comedy.  It is a great feel good movie.,1385424000,,111,4.5
5858633,4,B00DV1XYTO,I thought it had some funny comedy. But thought it could have had a little more punch lines then I would have gave it 5 starts.,1385424000,,127,3.923076923076923
5858634,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Loved this movie. This is one of Owen Wilson's better movies, and the same for Vince Vaugh. I love the story line because it's so true. Not many jobs out there, so love that it's using the real life scenario now to teach college grads how to be creative in seeking jobs.",1385337600,,270,4.211538461538462
5858635,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Horrible, don't waste your time so disappointed in Vince Vaughn's performance, they came across as sad old men. Definately seemed forced.",1385337600,,137,5.571428571428571
5858636,4,B00DV1XYTO,It was pretty good.  I am a fan of both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn but I have seen better work out of them.  This movie makes me want to intern at Google!!,1385337600,,157,3.727272727272727
5858637,4,B00DV1XYTO,"It was really funny with a good moral to the story. However it was a bit crass here and there with the sexual comments. Other then that it was a good movie, a 1 time watch for me. If I had younger kids I wouldn't let them watch it as it is not appropriate for them.",1385337600,,265,3.75
5858638,5,B00DV1XYTO,Vince Vaugh & Owen Wilson are amazing.  This movie was hilarious.  Laughed throughout the movie. just needing 5 more words to complete this review...,1385337600,,149,5.166666666666667
5858639,1,B00DV1XYTO,Terrible movie.  Not worth the rent. Terrible acting and terrible plot. Come on VV.  You are better than this. No good,1385251200,,118,4.571428571428571
5858640,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I think Bob Dylan's song is a good metaphor for what we are seeing here. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have delivered plenty of laughs in the past, and I guess a question is: Is their brand of humor still relevant and fresh? Based on what I saw here, the answer is a resounding ""Yes"". I had as much fun with this movie as with Wedding Crashers, and even though there may have been a couple of overly silly jokes here, the overall experience was more than satisfactory.

In this movie we see Vaughn's and Owen's characters struggling with a changing world, which I thought was a nice parallel to what I referenced above about their careers. The two friends find themselves out of a job when their careers selling watches clearly became obsolete. When they go for a bold move and decide to apply for an internship at Google, we get to see a clash of two worlds that provides a myriad of laughs and some very interesting social commentary. Maybe these old guys have something to teach the young techno wizards after all, but also may find some useful tips in the process.

This is an outstanding comedy, with a nice variety of tools used to make us laugh. The cast is pretty impressive, and all of them do a great job in their roles. It was good to see Aasif Mandvi, who I have followed for quite some time in The Daily Show, crash into the big screen in a proficient fashion. There is some raunchy humor too, which is always welcome from my perspective. So overall, this is a movie that is perfect for having a good time and laugh quite a bit in the process.",1385251200,,1555,4.358620689655172
5858641,2,B00DV1XYTO,"Boring, very borning.  We hardley see anything but a few locations.  Some random fun but overall don't bother renting it.",1385164800,,121,5.0

5858644,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Stupid, stupid, stupid.........Not worth the effort.  Why did they make this movie and why did these actors choose to be in it?",1385164800,,127,4.7727272727272725
5858645,5,B00DV1XYTO,"If you liked Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in ""The Wedding Crashers"" then you should like ""The Internship"". Its about two older guys recently unemployed and seeking an internship at Google. Knowing nothing of computers but everything about the art of sales and personal relationships, they are thrust into the milieu of the young and ambitious. They have to demonstrate team work, ingenuity and computer savvy in order to get a job. Lessons are learned, friendships made, and some things proven wrong. Very funny, endearing and well written or at least I think so. At the very least you might have a laugh or two. Come on give it a shot.",1385078400,3,636,4.738738738738738
5858646,5,B00DV1XYTO,Great movie. Funny. Corny love angle. Nice and clean story line. The story takes place at Google campus and these older guys try to reinvent themselves by taking on a Google internship.,1385078400,,185,4.8125

5858648,3,B00DV1XYTO,Funny in a simplistic way. The story hits home with the challenges of losing a job and having to compete with the next generation. i also liked the idea of giving people a chance. Definitely not suitable for kids.,1385078400,,213,4.487179487179487
5858649,4,B00DV1XYTO,Entertaining and a typical Vaughn and Wilson movie.  Both do a very good job and i had a lot of laughs,1384992000,,102,3.857142857142857

5858654,2,B00DV1XYTO,"Uuugghh... really predictable and jokes were lame (""On-the-line"" Really?). Seems like they thought it would be funnier when they wrote it but it didn't resonate well on screen. They can't all be winners.",1384905600,,203,5.181818181818182
5858655,5,B00DV1XYTO,Great movie! And no creepy scenes like the Wedding Crashers! Just lots of fun and classic Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson dry humor. Definitely one to watch again.,1384905600,,158,4.678571428571429
5858656,1,B00DV1XYTO,"This is a terrible movie. Vince Vaughn wrote it. Apparently, he just tried to capitalize on the ""old school"" formula from 10+ years ago.  This is a cheap Corporate branded knock off of old school.  Its predictable and not funny.  Save your money!",1384905600,,246,4.674418604651163

5858662,4,B00DV1XYTO,Fun movie.  Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are always pretty good together.  The ending was a little to predictable but this was a simple movie.,1384819200,,142,4.64

5858672,5,B00DV1XYTO,"Very funny!  The wife talked me into renting it on amazon prime and honestly, its a really decent movie.

It could have been funnier and I really was not that great for young people entering the work force in the 80's as the two would have been, that is why they were where they were wasn't it? The only time I know that opportunity was great was the 60's and then half the guys had to go to war left lots of open jobs ...plus women were not taking them all either. not saying  they don't deserve them just that more people for completion and great completion they are.",1384646400,,569,4.317757009345795

While Vaughn and Wilson riffing off each other has been the high point of their films in the past, it seems like they were given way too much freedom to do so here and the movie feels very unfocused because of it.

I can see why people wouldn't like it since it's one of those typical stupid/funny movies but for me it was funny and if you appreciate technology andsocial media, it's a solid movie about Google.

5858727,3,B00DV1XYTO,"This looked interesting, started well and established a reason for the viewer to empathize with oddball main characters.

At the beginning, except for a few examples of bad language, I was really enjoying this with my hubby. It also seemed the kind of movie you can show on a movie night and discuss with friends or even older kids to open dialogue without being overbearing in its message.

However, unless you have TV Guardian, ClearPlay or a filter of some kind, I wouldn't rec for kids; but there were several good encouraging life lessons here about underdogs, persevering, following directions, team spirit, and bullying.

But then . . . then the writers/producers felt it necessary to include several minutes of nude breasts, scanty clothing, graphic lap dancing, excess drinking, and more than one scene of a barely legal age, and very inebriated,male character repeatedly going to the men's room to use the the wall dryer blow on the front of his pants.  Yecch!

Once the grossness was over, the movie again was enjoyable, with even a couple of nice character surprises at the end; even though generally predictable.

Yes it was a Google commercial, but I found that interesting really, I'd love to work there for sure.  The movie's overall message was more about the journey taken to reach a goal, which is what would have made it worthy to watch and share.

IMO, what a shame. It is sans explosions, gore, vampires, or demons; a rarity these days.

The lewd scenes were a bummer. If such doesn't bother you as much as it did me, then this movie is a solid three stars.",1384214400,,1579,4.733576642335766

This is light and uplifting comedic entertainment which gives you a couple of hours of amusement, with the messages that ""you can achieve success if you try"" and ""work together as a team to achieve success"". These are mildly and amusingly conveyed, without overpowering the light comedy.

I enjoyed watching this movie- Messrs Vaughn and Wilson reprise the successful ""Wedding Crasher"" buddy characters formula- although in this movie they are more sympathetically drawn.

I think its wrong to call kids FAT,,,SO FAT and Pussy.  Who wrote this movie?  And, why would Google ever endorse a movie like this??  Pathetic!!

This movie is about two wrist watch salesman played by own Wilson and Vince Vaughn who get canned by their boss John Goodman because everything now is about technology and hardly anyone wears wrist watches  they just look at there cell phones to tell what time it is. so Goodman closes the company down sells the space and uses the money to retire and move to Florida leaving both of our down on there luck leading guys jobless. so it then shows Owen Wilson getting a job with will Ferrell selling mattresses. while this is going on Vince Vaughn's character is at home searching for jobs and sees an internship for Google. He also enrolls them at phoenix university the online college. so pretty much they go as interns, they get grouped up with some outcasts to go up against the other teams of interns.  which they ultimately win in the end. there are a few chuckles and laughs but really its just an opportunity to see Wilson and Vaughn team up once again.

The only issue I had was that, thankfully, Google does NOT pit its employees or interns against each other in competitions.

What I loved about this movie the most was the mentor-like relationship between the two men and the younger coworkers that eventually developed.  It was so positive and sweet. Who wouldn't want these guys at their company? It was kind of depressing also that there was only one woman on the team, (which, sadly, reflects my experience at Google Engineering and other Silicon Valley companies)  but it was awesome that she was treated respectfully and the only dating that went on was between similarly aged characters (for a change!)",1383609600,2,1187,4.729468599033816

Vince Vaughn, being one of my favorite actors continued to make draw me back to watch the trailer periodically until I finally decided to rent this movie. it does not disappoint.

The story depicts two salesmen, Vaughn and Wilson who end up being interns at Google after the business they worked at goes under without warning and they are informed of this while trying to close a sale with a former client.  This was a hail-mary by Vaughn in an attempt to achieve greatness for both men, once again.

The internship quickly shows them that they are not in the right place, but the pieces slowly fall into place merging their skills with their tech-savvy team, ultimately culminating in greatness.

I was even considering giving up on the movie less than half way through but I hung in there, especially considering I paid to rent it.  I am actually glad I hung in there because I liked the ending and the message about believing in yourself, etc, etc.  The characters that Wilson and Vaughn played were too similar to too many other characters they have played.  I don't recall laughing at anything in the movie but it had some feel good moments (especially the ending).

If you don't know the basic story premise, l won't repeat them here ... Google it. I liked the movie because I happened to be in a similar situation these guys find themselves, lost job, a tad older and seeing it's a younger persons world. What made it fresh was that it provided a humorous and sometimes scary view of what the kids are facing, what we can learn from them and vice versa all in an place that most of the connected world knows very well. Yes, some of the gags and jokes are predictable, yes, we've seen movies with generation clashes but this one hit home for me in a nice way. You feel good at the end. The cast was remarkable.
All that being said, the PG-13 rating was a bit generous, you will likely be a bit uneasy at some of the scenes at the nightclub. No nudity but lots of sexual suggestions. If you can handle that, it may be good to have a teen around to translate some of their humor to you!

5858812,3,B00DV1XYTO,"The internship was a pretty decent movie. Had a lot of good laughs but I was unable to give it a 4 or 5 due to two factors. Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughn. Why must Will Ferrel always show up in cameo roles that are the same ignorant, loud and obnoxious character that he seems to think is funny? He's a one trick pony in his acting skills and its old. Very old. The scene he plays in the mattress store isn't even funny. As for Vince Vaughn, I had to overlook his usual overzealous mouth diarrhea that he is famous for. It is toned down a bit in this movie and that helps to keep it watchable but sometimes less is more. All in all, the story is decent and there are a few really good funny moments. The Intern is worth the 5 or 6 bucks for rental but I'm glad I didn't waste 30 or 40 bucks at the theater for it.",1383350400,,812,3.9272727272727272

saw actors acting, removing me from the story and making me know I was watching a movie.

However in real time the movie is a grab bag of lazy writing, flat jokes, tortured cliches and a bullet riddled plot full of holes. No one on the set seems to know what they're supposed to say, where they're supposed to stand or even why they're even there. And if you didn't know all of the perks of the Google brand before you sat down, you'll know that 'ish by the end of this thing.

In the end, it is just funny enough for the type-casted performance one would expect from these guys, what puts it over the top is the theme...if it resonates, you'll probably like it...if it doesn't, you might be the victim in the movie.

5858936,4,B00DV1XYTO,"As a preface, I should say that I truly enjoyed Wedding Crashers, which is why I was looking forward to this movie. The comedy chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson made that movie, and I was not disappointed to see it still there in this movie. Oh, sure, there's not a lot of surprises here; two middle-aged, likeable, out-of-work guys desperate for jobs land internships amongst the twenty-somethings at Google and comedy is supposed to ensue, and it does, for the most part. The tech-savvy twenty-somethings look down their noses at the over-the-hill dinosaurs; those dinosaurs teach the twenty-somethings how to tear themselves away from their electronics and reconnect with life, and people. Some of the gags are a little tired, and a little trite, but the movie does a good job of avoiding becoming too corny. For me, the obligatory ""bad guy"" is fairly one-dimensional and disposable, and the ""love interest"" isn't all that well developed as a character, but overall the movie hits all the right notes for a buddy comedy in a pleasant way, and it moves along at an entertaining pace that makes its almost two hour running time seem short. Perhaps the most interesting side benefit of the movie is the peek you get at the world of Google. I'd read that Google was happy to assume the role of a character in the movie, and that much of the film was actually shot on Google's campus in California. That little side trip behind the scenes at Google was an added benefit to a movie that was entertaining, funny and enjoyable. For me, this movie was well worth the time, and the rental fee. Would I pay to own it? I'm not sure that I'd pay bust-out retail for it, but once it comes down below the $10 mark, it would be worth it to include in my movie library.",1382659200,,1768,4.598101265822785

Thus begins my official review of the movie on my website.  I did not get to see any extra features because it was a rental, but I loved the movie and definitely plan to own it.

It is a sharp witted, well paced comedy that perfectly showcases the best of the director and starring talents.  I am starting to get a feel for Shawn Levy's style and I like it.

5858954,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Vince Vaughan & Owen Wilson play two unemployed salesmen that land an internship at Google that may or may not materialize in terms of a job. The story develops as they are competing against young tech-savvy interns for a job.

This movie has been called a long commercial for Google, and sure, that is one perspective. I happened to enjoy getting to see more of Google. Parts of it were filmed at Google, and other parts were recreated. Google employees have commented on how realistic the environment is, with the exception of the competitive nature of the internships.

The competition is what drives the movie and puts the characters in humorous situations. As a whole, the movie reportedly captures the essence of working at Google, and that realism (true-to-life-over-the-topness and Googliness) are what made the movie particularly enjoyable for me.

I could have done without the gratuitous nudity, as it did not add to the plot in any way. At least it was contained in one scene of the movie, so as to make skipping it more easy.

I loved Wedding Crashers and did all I could to temper my expectations for this because Wedding Crashers is such a classic it would have been hard to compete with that one. Hard as I tried though I found myself comparing this to Wedding Crashers over and over, but in my defense many of the jokes and the way they act are pretty similar. I'm not saying this isn't funny because it is and I did laugh a lot but it wasn't nearly as good as Wedding Crashers and was incredibly predictable.

5858965,3,B00DV1XYTO,"This is a by-the-books comedy about two men who, finding themselves unemployed, decide to try to hack it among the young, uber-techs vying for one of Google's coveted internships. The plot is unabashedly paint-by-numbers, with not a single cliched element unaccounted for. There is a contest between a group of underdogs and a mouthy, despicable team of cocky jerks. There is a stilted love story between a job-obsessed lady and a guy who shows her how to finally let her hair down. A fighting montage where a woman's honor has been besmirched by big-shouldered jerks. A sports montage involved Quidditch for no reason at all. There is a subplot about overcoming self-doubt in the face of overwhelming odds. A twiggy, hopeless nerd gets the girl (in defiance of all logic). The smug hipster dude learns how to soften his cool exterior. Let's not forget tons of jokes about how these forty-something fellas apparently know nothing about popular culture and computers (including, but not limited to, the X-Men, the difference between the phrases ""on the line"" and ""on-line,"" and what Instagram is).

The movie is tired, and a lot of the jokes are forced. It's nearly impossible to believe that our leads are as stupid as they are sometimes presented (they don't know how a webcam works? really?), but also smart enough to pick up competitive Google programming knowledge in the course of a week or two. They clash with the youngsters in their team, but serious bonding finally happens during a drunken, irresponsible night at a strip club, a scene that seemed to have been thrown together at the last minute. Rarely, if ever, does anything happen that isn't expected by any audience member who's seen this movie before, whether it was called Animal House or Old School or Heavyweights.

Of course, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are incredibly charming guys, and since they're basically playing themselves, they lighten the predictability with the sole force of their personalities. Likewise, a few cameos (especially Will Ferrel's) add a dose of freshness to the otherwise stale material. A few moments here and there keep the entire thing from feeling oppressively rote and uninspired, so the whole thing's not a total wash.

5858982,5,B00DV1XYTO,"I think the movie was great. If you enjoy the two main actors other work, you'll find the comedy similar to their other movies, which I don't think is a bad thing at all. One facet of the movie that I enjoyed was that it discussed something rarely talked about. As seen in the preview, the two fellows in the story lose their jobs. They were great at their jobs and great with people, but they stuck themselves into a position with no real escape. That position collapsed on them, and they lost their jobs and had no other rsum-worthy skills to fall back on. The idea of Google is used to represent the availability of information; it used to be in libraries and book stores (and still is, to an extent). What happens to the characters is not discussed in this great of detail (it has to be inferred), but they settle into skills they are familiar with and stop looking for self (and business) expansion. It raises some interesting and very basic questions, like ""what is work?"" The movie does a great job of presenting classically-held beliefs, such as working for rude people at a job you don't like just to get a paycheck, and it also touches on working for a poor-paying job because you're good at it and enjoy it (their first jobs in the movie). The more modern idea--presented through the movie via the Google business model--is that people don't have to do something they don't enjoy forever and they don't have to accept less because they enjoy their work. Information has always been available, and this movie is about two guys who finally decide to take advantage of that information, to so something they thought about but never put into action. That is the core message that I got from the movie, and I thought the comedy overtone was great for introducing the idea.

I will definitely watch this movie again, and would highly recommend a purchase or a rental.",1380672000,,1872,4.571428571428571

I gave this movie 5 stars because I watched it knowing it might be a huge Google advertisement, most likely corny as hec, and most probably some type of cliche.  Then I threw it all out the window and just relaxed and enjoyed the show.  Cliche or not, it is always good to be reminded of them and watch with an open mind.  A lot of corny moments, but it fit in perfectly.  Google advertisement, well, after watching that movie who doesn't want to work for Google.  I mean come on, they probably have the only playground that isn't made safe to the point that they suck.  That being said, this movie met my expectations and more, especially with the hidden reminders all over the movie.  Good job overall.

I didn't expect a whole lot out of this film, but it looked funny, so I wanted to see it. It DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations (more so than Wedding Crashers and most, if not all, other movies these actors have been in individually). It is funny in a way that's not overdone. Also, it's something new and different! Not the same old story you see in every movie. Has a great message and is just all-around an awesome movie! I have no problem with raunchy films, but I didn't expect this movie to be one I would want to watch with my mother, just because of the two main actors. However; I found it pleasantly appropriate for just about everyone! SO funny! Will definitely be buying it as soon as it comes out!",1380585600,,866,4.487341772151899

As much as I enjoyed ""Wedding Crashers"" this movie seemed like a feeble attempt to recreate it using the same characters...except it just was not as successful this time.  The movie is funny...mostly... but I found myself looking to see how much was left from time to time.

It's not a bad movie if you have a couple hours to kill on a trans-Atlantic flight but I wouldn't rent it and I won't spend time to see it again (as I have ""Wedding Crashers"")",1379548800,,487,4.271739130434782

But this story was too much of a ""Win one for the gipper"" kind of movie with a pretty predictable ending.  There were good laughs in this movie but they were few and far between.  And to be honest I felt like this was just a movie about how great Google is and all the things you can do at Google.  So I felt like they were advertising that point from start to finish.  Overall it wasn't a terrible movie, just ok.  It could have been better and going into it I thought it was gonna be the sleeper comedy of the summer.  But unfortunately I got the sleeper part right.  Its an ok rental but not a movie I would add to my collection.",1376092800,,802,4.089743589743589
5858988,5,B00DV1XYTO,"""If you thought Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson could not be anymore wackier, wait until you see The Internship. They play two losing-out salespersons of watches only to then fake their way to enroll as University of Phoenix students applying for an internship at Google. Their plans to find work go back-and-forth to zaniness and mania knowing that they are unsure about the modern trends in technology around them with the young other interns.

If you think the plot is too outlandish and concept-oriented, think again, this film actually exists and the product placement that it so has is put into good effect without meandering to be generic and silly all the way. The film also grabs your attention by just being utterly hilarious without it meaning to be with Vaughn's witty banter and Wilson's low-key whispering sense of dry humour. The chemistry is strong and seeing them get within the Google intern framework talking to the Australian woman, questioning responses to their internship manager, drinking and getting off their head with their colleagues (which is probably the most hilarious thing I have seen in a long time along with an interview scene involving Vaughn and Wilson at a public library), Vaughn saying ""on-the-line"" all the time, and them talking game to a pizza manager, a man with a elderly woman fixation, and them eating chips with U. of Phoenix shirts on.

The film was beyond what I could have imagined and it keeps strong by being relevant, witty (with the intrinisic Google tech references), and down-to-earth in a way by showcasing the problems inherent with old-school workers and the new-school, tech-oriented types, trusting and believing in yourself, and managing to keep your head up high amidst adversity and a charlatan (played by Max Minghella here). There is a lot to see, laugh, hear, and probably learn here that the marketing gimmick found here does not seem wasted like you would find in a film like Transformers.

While the film might seem a bit sentimental and generic to a casual Hollywood comedy script from 2006, it does not fail at that aspect, it actually enhances its weirdness in an era full of raunchy, R-rated comedies that boil down to over inflated jokes about drugs and sex. While it won't be on everyone's radar, The Internship is definitely one to look out for especially if you also like normal or high-concept comedies like Dodgeball, Wild Hogs, Without a Paddle, Caddyshack, and Happy Gilmore.""",1375574400,,2457,4.95873786407767
5858989,4,B00DV1XYTO,"Two dinosaur salesmen (Vince Vaughn/ Owen Wilson) find themselves as interns at Google. They are fish out of water as they have to deal with the youth and terminology of the tech world. They are divided into teams with our duo on the misfit team which leads to formulaic results.

This is a fun film which doesn't offend. The humor is not overwhelmingly laugh out loud, by rather tritely funny. That is not to say it is bad, but simply lacks originality.

Worth a view. Makes for a good rental.

5858990,4,B00DV1XYTO,"I enjoyed this movie and I'd recommend it. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play two close friends who lose their jobs as salesmen after the company closes. They enter the google internship program, hoping to land two of the 5 available and coveted jobs. Much older and far less educated (technically speaking) than the other interns, they make their mark.

Here's what I enjoyed:

- I can't say there were many laugh out loud moments, but it was always entertaining and fun.

- It had  a couple of upbeat, feel good messages that I really enjoyed.

- It was a relevant story. Many people will relate to at least one of the characters in the film.

- As always, the way Vaughn and Wilson played off each other was entertaining.

- The movie kept my attention throughout. The story was interesting.

Another reviewer mentioned that this movie is one big advertisement for google. Yes it is. However that didn't bother me. The movie was fresh, and the use of google was current. It was cool seeing how google treats its employees.

Parents there was one scene with drinking, exotic dancers, and sexual content.

So I do recommend this movie to adults and young adults.",1373155200,21,1162,4.651960784313726
5858991,1,B00DV1XYTO,"Listen beautiful babies, I only have time to say this once and whether you're just a baby chick or a full grown hen there's not a lot of people that don't know the cadence of a metaphor-laced Vince Vaughn pep-talk speech, but if you haven't heard one of these fast paced gems it's an anecdotal mess - but the kind of mess where something may accidentally come of it, I mean Columbus thought he was in the West Indies but it's no reason to ridicule the man, it's the genocide that maybe gives the guy a damaged rep but hey you gotta get back on the horse man, and do it like a champion, a CHAMPION!

And there you have the message of Vaughn's latest buddy comedy, The Internship.  Not genocide, but a mess where something worthwhile might occasionally, accidentally come out of it.  Vaughn's speeches have become less `cute' and more clich this time around, and so it goes with The Internship.  The film opens with the most uncomfortable scene of the year where two forty-somethings played by Vaughn and co-star Owen Wilson wildly sing Alanis Morrisette's ""Ironic,"" which is ironically un-ironic as the scene is so cringe-inducing and not funny that you can't wait for it to end.  Vaughn and Wilson play Billy and Nick, two guys who lose their sales jobs and nonsensically end up as interns at Google in a final attempt to get their hands on that ever-elusive American dream.  And just in case that wasn't clear, prepare yourself for Owen Wilson's tepid recitation of Langston Hughes's ""A Dream Deferred.""

Part of The Internship's humor revolves around how old Vaughn and Wilson are compared to the young, spry geniuses typically courted by Google.  However, that humor is lost rather quickly as it becomes too apparent that Vaughn and Wilson are simply too old for this.  Wilson is especially awkward.  He showed such promise in a more mature role with Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris, but it seems his days are numbered as the immature feathered haired sidekick.  It's laughable (in a bad way) to imagine that these two supposedly excellent salesmen still have live-in girlfriends and virtually no marketable skills.  Nick's foray into selling mattresses for his brother-in-law (played by Will Ferrell in a moderately funny cameo) proves that these guys are stereotypical screen characters just waiting to prove their worth at some inevitable time when their charm can benefit some unorthodox circumstance.

Simply put, the first act of this film has hardly any redeeming quality and if you walked out, I wouldn't blame you.  Nonetheless, if you suffer through the laborious opening, things do get better - not much better, but better.  Bill and Nick (a pair of more ubiquitous names would be difficult to imagine) eventually find themselves the underdogs on a team of further underdogs who must compete against other intern teams for a chance at a full-time job with the company.  The tasks are obscenely unconventional as the audience is constantly barraged by propaganda about Google's progressive nature (Do Google interns truly take part in live competitive Quidditch matches?).  Nonetheless, once the exposition is complete, the film livens up a bit with an entertaining nightclub scene and a funny take on a ""first date"" scene when Nick courts an executive named Dana (Rose Byrne) who has conveniently forgotten how to have fun and needs a man to remind her of what's important (actually, feminists may want to avoid the movie in its entirety).

Vaughn and Wilson teamed up once before in the incomparably better film, Wedding Crashers.  These two do have chemistry, but only if the material holds up.  Unfortunately for The Internship, it does not and only the screenwriter is to blame, Vince Vaughn.  Vaughn's two other screenwriting credits, The Break-Up and Couples Retreat, happen to be equally vapid.  His writing relies on cheap gags, stereotypes, and in the case of The Internship, a strange motif where the bushier a character's eyebrows, the more villainous the character's intentions.  The Internship is basically a thinly veiled advertisement for the virtuosity and distinctiveness of Google.  Unfortunately, for the average paying theater-goer, the film is not as innovative as its subject.  Consider passing up this Internship.  D",1371686400,15,4263,5.002832861189802
