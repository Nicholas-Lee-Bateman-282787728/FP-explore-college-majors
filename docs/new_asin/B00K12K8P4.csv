6398202,5,B00K12K8P4,"I expected more than the usual soft-core sex film here, since we are talking writer and director Zalman King (9/1-2 weeks, Red-Shoe Diaries, etc.) and was not disappointed. I think the ladies will be interested in the lead male character, Jack and the guys will most likely be enamored with Malena Morgan as Victoria, Jack's love interest (whom he marries). Definitely a film for audiences 18 and over, of course!",1402185600,4,413,4.914285714285715
6398203,4,B00K12K8P4,"Normally, I view these movies as one in the same (""Soft Porn"", ""Blue"", ""Erotic"", etc...).  But, after watching this particular entry from end-to-end, I was pleased with the psychological aspects of obsession/want/desire demonstrated.

What is one willing to do for love?

How far will one go?

Watch and see.

Normally, people watch these films for the physical act.  You won't see much of that here (unlike other flicks, where it seemingly happens every five minutes)!  Secondly, it was obvious that a decent sum of  money was allocated for the actors wardrobe - and it shows!  The wardrobe really enhances the scenes!  Very, very stylish (see what I mean for yourself)!

The script?  Decent! (again, better than most for this type of film)

Overall, I rate ""Pleasure or Pain"" - Four stars!

P.S., Even thought this project came out in 2012, I just learned today that this was Zalman King's last effort before his untimely passing - R.I.P., Zalman!

P.P.S., (09/08/14) I originally paid the $26.95 for this, now under $14/US.  Great price for the product!  Recommended!",1400976000,18,1070,4.988636363636363

6398216,1,B00K12K8P4,Horrible! Malena Morgan is the worst actress ever and what is wrong with the way she speaks. I have seen hard core porn movies with better actors than this! What a disappointing last piece of work from Zalman King!,1431129600,3,214,4.512820512820513

6398220,3,B00K12K8P4,"The box cover synopsis for this Zalman King erotic production refers to it as: ""9 1/2 Weeks for a new generation"" and that pretty much sums up the 'plot' of this flik. A rich, worldly guy (Jack) seduces a younger naive woman (Victoria) and puts her through a lot of sexual 'changes' for 'lord knows' what purpose?!

There is an irony that this re-hash of his own ground-breaking 1986 film (that was largely responsible for putting his name on the map) proved to be King's final release prior to his death.

Like all of King's soft core ero-ductions this 'film' has slick production values and is loaded with 'attractive' individuals who are panting after one another. Several of the key set pieces from ""9 1/2 Weeks"" are reprised: the 'food sex' and: having the girl dress up in men's clothing gender/bender scenes in particular, and the ladies are constantly being 'commanded' to remove their underwear and 'do it' in unusual places.  This film definitely would appear to be focused on female fantasies of the '50 Shades of Gray"" soft dominance variety.

For me, as a male viewer, the stand-out elements were decidedly the attractiveness of the females involved in the production and their tendency to be shedding their clothing at the drop of a hat. Despite the fact that a lot of panties get discarded the camera keeps everything 'soft core' throughout, and never drops below the waist in any of the nude scenes - thus no full nakedness - ever!  Likewise - the 'sex scenes' are also 'artfully' handled to keep them at a 'respectable' level that might play on TV... which IS where much of King's product ended up.

In the final analysis, despite a lot of well lit attractive female (and male) flesh on display, I found the end result to be rather un-engaging.  The lead actress (altho VERY lovely to behold) was pretty weak in her dramatic acting skills, and the male protagonist just came off like a bit of a jerk - not much empathy was produced for any of the 'players' involved in this tale of 'lifestyles of the rich and jaded'... which ultimately left a somewhat flat feeling when it was all said and done. There is certainly little of the electricity between the male & female leads that can compare to the quirky chemistry between Mickey Rourke & Kim Basinger in the original '9 1/2 Weeks'.

A pleasant enough viewing experience with all the lean young bodies on display - but not alotta substance.

YET - regardless of the quality of this 'final offering' - Zalman KIng DID set a new standard for erotica in his many productions and his contributions to the field will be missed - he was a true pioneer.",1419724800,11,2613,4.650759219088937

6398223,4,B00K12K8P4,I was finally able to watch this movie on YouTube. And I must say it is a movie that gets you thinking.  Told from Victoria ' s POV she tells the story of how she met Jack. How it went from love to tragedy.  And the sex is soft porn but deeply erotic.  Zalman King did a good job. Not saying this is his best but it is a movie to watch.,1417132800,2,336,3.638888888888889

8655031,2,B00K12K8P4,"The actors in this film are smokin'.  Lovely bodies - nice to look at - naked or clothed.  The cinemtography is fantastic - great lighting, highlighting the emotion and action of each scene.  By and large, sylistically, the film rocks.  I have no complaint with the look of the film and the looks of the actors.  Obviously all of Mr. King's flurishes.

Unfortunately, the lead actor who plays Jack reminded me of Michael Nader of Dynasty and All My Children (can't hide my age).  I kept expecting him to say ""Alexis!""  The other actors - well, although their bodies were smokin', tight with great physiques - they just couldn't act with the appropriate feelings.  I failed to be stimulated (err) by the sex portrayed.  It looked overly choreographed as if each motion/stroke/smack had been done on a power point.  I half expected in the credits to read who the lipstick co-ordinator was.

The scene in the club - was interesting.  The music behind the scene seemed more sexual to me than action on the floor.  By and large, a film made well, but the acting left me feeling eh.",1440028800,3,1076,4.624338624338624
