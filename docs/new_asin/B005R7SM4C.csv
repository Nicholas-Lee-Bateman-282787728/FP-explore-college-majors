8484172,3,B005R7SM4C,"That is an old Bosnian proverb and the hero of this film seems to attract enemies effortlessly. This is a follow up to `Largo Winch', in that it reprises that character as a rich kid, philanthropist, action hero. Played pretty much straight by Tomer Sisley, he is the adopted son of a billionaire who runs `W' Corporation - not sure if we are allowed to speculate what the `W' stands for but by the end of the film you will probably think it isn't `Winch'.

Largo has spent time posing as a tourist in Burma when he gets dragged back to the reality of unbelievable wealth as his father is dead. He then inherits a global company worth $53 Billion and decides to sell it all putting the funds into his Charitable Foundation, an act so self less that even Batman might have thought twice. Still all is not well as Sharon Stone is on his case. She plays feisty human rights lawyer Diane Francken, who has an eye for the boys, a no nonsense attitude and a habit of acting on half baked uncorroborated `evidence'.

The charges against Largo are so heinous that he has no option, he must go back to Burma to clear his name, this will involve the use of his hypochondriac butler to track down a womanising gamblerholic , a corrupt Burmese General (never! I hear you gasp) and some of the worlds worst soldiers imaginable.

Thus the scene is set for a hundred minutes of action, intrigue, double cross and Sharon Stone sitting down facing the camera but crucially with a pair of knickers - never saw that one coming! The action is all quite good, the car chases are great if you like seeing German Staff cars get a kicking, and the gun play is often and loud. Lots of CGI explosions too if that is your bag, there are quite a few plot holes, rather too many, but to say more is a plot spoiler.

This generally was not well received and did not make any way near what its predecessor took, despite assembling a great team for the music, the photography and direction; it is the plot where things fall apart. Ms Stone is clunking in a cartoon way, but that is not her fault, and Sisley is actually good and as I said plays it straight, so not too bad and if you suspend belief you will be pleasantly surprised as this is just pure escapism. If you want an intelligent film that explores some of the issues it touches on, like human rights in Burma, or corruption or the International Criminal Court or the laughable Swiss Banks who don't want to be seen holding a tyrants money (jeez its hardly the first time is it boys?) then do not bother. A lot of  the action you will have seen before only done a bit better; check out the sky diving scene, if he had landed and asked for a vodka martini at least it would have been funny, instead you just want to groan. Still it whiled away a bit of time and as a kid I would have lapped it up, so not all bad. In French, English and Burmese with good sub titles and the promise of a sequel - only joking on that last one, I hope.",1336003200,2,2960,4.269162210338681
8484173,3,B005R7SM4C,"Following the TV series and a 2008 French feature film, another film is made about Largo Winch, a Belgian comic-book billionaire hero created by Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme. In ""Largo Winch II,"" (its international title is ""The Burma Conspiracy""), Tomer Sisley, who played Largo Winch in the first film, reprises the role of largo Winch. Though Sharon Stone is second billed, her role is comparatively small in ""LWII.""

After his adoptive father Nerio (Miki Manojlovic) is murdered, young Largo Winch, now the head of W Group, decides to sell the Hong Kong-based, multinational corporation he inherited, and donate the entire profits to charity. But things take an unexpected turn when Largo is accused of committing crimes against humanity in Burma, where he had lived three years before.

Directed by Jrme Salle (""Anthony Zimmer,"" remade as ""The Tourist"" in Hollywood), the story of ""Largo Winch II"" drags a little in the opening chapters, taking too much time to set up a plotline with several lengthy flashbacks. While the Jason Bourne-style action set-pieces are better than average, with one great sky-diving sequence, most central characters (including Largo and Largo's love interest) remain uninteresting. Some might find Sharon Stone's character crossing her legs amusing (remember ""Basic Instinct""?), but honestly I really don't see the point of doing that here.

Not a terrible movie by any standards, but ""Largo Winch II"" could have been a much thrilling ride with a tighter plotline and more fleshed-out characters.",1320278400,,1536,5.286885245901639
8484174,5,B005R7SM4C,"I saw Largo Winch a couple years ago and liked it. I'm a huge fan of the BOURNE IDENTITY films, and these two Largo movies are the closest thing to them, but still are unique in their own way. Largo 2: The Burma Conspiracy contains all the elements of a great action movie. Strong acting, colorful characters and a smart, intelligent plot. In this film, the pace is much faster relative to the first film, and there are many more action scenes, including a few which are fairly violent. The movie takes the viewer on a tour of some exciting locations such as Thailand, Burma, Hong Kong and Switzerland and the scenery is indeed eye-catching even for the most seasoned traveler. Sharon Stone is a real treat to watch. They obviously cast her to make the movie more desirable for Americans, but she's at the top of her game here and I only wish she got a little more screen time. This DVD is excellent with a great anamorphic widescreen picture, few compression artifacts, and good 5.1 sound. The DVD played just fine in my USA DVD player. Highly recommended.",1317600000,5,1057,4.568421052631579
