8018529,3,B0001Z48U2,"This movie was okay; it really couldn't decide whether to be a romance or a thriller.  The only real romance was at the very end; the thriller part was somewhat boring and lukewarm at best.  This could have been better - the two stars were very good, but the plot was not up to par.",1194739200,,282,4.109090909090909
8018530,4,B0001Z48U2,"Why the heck isn't Chris Potter a star?
Given very little to work with, Chris Potter, Chandra West and Art Hindle make the most of a paint by the numbers script. Great chemistry and even better acting between the leads makes this a fun evening with the telly.",1191628800,,259,4.416666666666667
8018531,5,B0001Z48U2,What do you want from a Harlequin movie? This one has intrigue as well as romance and I liked the twists and turns. Mixed reviews usually mean the thing is worth investigating. It is fun stuff!,1128556800,5,193,4.388888888888889
8018532,3,B0001Z48U2,"The Waiting Game, a decent made for TV suspense drama. I couldn't understand why it was a part of a Romance Series, it was more about CIA mystery stuff than anything else. However, my biggest complaint is about Paula Abdul. For all of the future viewers of this movie, please be aware that if you're going to see it because of Paula, you should know that she's not really in it that much. She has more of a supporting role with a couple of lines sprinkled here and there. Don't be fooled by the advertisements. If you're planning to watch this just to see Paula, be careful, for you may end up playing a ""waiting game"" of your very own.",1114646400,7,636,4.308333333333334
8018533,4,B0001Z48U2,"This was your standard ""romance book turned TV movie"" fare. If you don't look at it as anything else and don't take it too seriously, you'll be happy with the result.  The acting (aside from veterans like Chris Potter, Jonathan Crombie, and the lead actress, Chandra West) was less than stellar.  I was flipping channels and actually stopped on the WE channel because I saw Jonathan Crombie who I love!!  You may remember, he played Gilbert on the ""Anne of Green Gables"" movie Trilogy which also starred Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst.  I fell in love with him years ago upon first viewing of those movies and have since seen them countless times - definatley one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time.  He was one of my first teenage crushes.  He has not aged too well but his acting is still good.  He will always be Gilbert to me though.

Anyway, I am a lover of romance (both books and movies) and I got caught up watching this movie.  The previous reviewer was right - the chemistry between Chris and Chandra was palpable.  They really worked as a romantic pair and they were the only reason I stuck with it (aside from Jonathan of course).  Chris Potter is total hunk and his scenes with Chandra are worth the price of admission.  He is a romance novel leading man come to life complete with the smoldering looks, the totally hot body, and the sizzling chemistry with the woman he loves.

If you like fluffy romances with a fairly interesting plot in addition to the ""will-they-or-won't-they"" storyline and a happy, albeit predictable ending, then this movie is for you.  Yes, Paula Abdul is in it and I thought she was passable as an actress. Not the greatest acting I've ever seen but definately not the worst.

Overall, a pretty good movie adaptation of a romance novel - I would definately recommend it and I would watch it again if it comes on TV.",1096243200,29,1864,4.538922155688622
8018534,1,B0001Z48U2,"I have always heard nothing but terrible reviews of this movie, so when I decided to finally see for myself (and this was solely because I am a Paula fan and wanted to see her...*bad acting*) it was worse than expected. The film lagged and reminded me of Paula's last venture in acting. ""touched by evil"" anyone (one of ABC's worst made for TV movies in history).

Bottem line: Not worth your precious time (unless you like Paula!).",1090195200,4,432,4.538461538461538
