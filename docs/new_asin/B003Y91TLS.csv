8599511,4,B003Y91TLS,"'Chess for Anyone', is a great starting point for beginners or intermediate players. It is an instructional video intended for classrooms and club events. Discusses pins in detail, fundamentals and some helpful pointers to keep in mind before you make every move. Mistakes even at the fundamental level cost high level player's important games. Examples are shown in the video.

The quality of the video is that of a good quality amateur 'hobby room' video producer. The intructions are slowly shown so that in a simple position you must exhaust all posibilities of attack, defence, etc. These things ARE all very important for the beginner to keep in mind if they want to get serious about chess and win games consistantly.

The other videos are all similar and til now discuss important fundamentals as well. Along with patterns to keep an eye out for.

Overall a respectable video great to watch with your child or associate if they are serious about developing there ability. All ages however can watch the video without upchucking in the kitchen sink. Teachers/Instructors will love it but will quickly be hungery for more.",1294272000,,1128,4.98936170212766
