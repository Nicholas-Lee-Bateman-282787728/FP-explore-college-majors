1558386,4,B00005JOTJ,"Teenage Katie (Alison Lohman) grew up on her family's beautiful quarter horse ranch in Montana.  She hasn't done well at boarding school and is in big trouble, especially after she brings home a wild mustang that she names ""Flicka.""  Against her father (Tim McGraw)'s orders, she sneaks out at night and tries to tame the horse; when dad finds out, he sells the horse to a rodeo and Katie's heart is broken.

If you're a horse-crazy girl between the ages of 9 and 13, you will absolutely love this movie.  Not only is the girl-horse bond strong, but so is the love between Katie and her father, mother, and brother.  They are an ideal family and virtue overcomes all odds, as we know it must in a PG-rated movie.  It's a simple and wholesome story with no offensive material, although if you're not a horse-loving adolescent, you may find it predictable and only mildly entertaining.  Alison Lohman and Tim McGraw give sensitive performances as the headstrong daughter and doting dad, but Maria Bello is too young and glamorous to be convincing as the mother/wife.  It's a good film for the target audience, and just in time for little girls to start begging for a horse for Christmas.",1162339200,37,1185,4.690821256038648
1558387,5,B00005JOTJ,"I have many movies this year. Most likely my total is over 100 films. Flicka ranks as one of the best that I have seen.

I didn't know what to expect walking into the theater. My wife likes Tim McGraw, but I don't care much for him. My daughter is horse crazy, and would love anything with horses in it. I expected a decent movie, but I didn't expect an amazing film.

Flicka is the story of a girl, Katy McLaughlin (played by Alison Lohman) who is struggling to carve her own way in life. She is failing at school, and like most teens, her relationship with her father (Tim McGraw) has its straining moments. During a summer ride, Katy stumbles upon a mountain lion, and a wild mustang horse which she later names Flicka. It is here that the story begins.

Flicka has all the elements of a great film. The acting was amazing. Tim McGraw and Alison Lohman were wonderful. I never expected Tim to be so good, but despite the fact that I dislike his singing, I loved his acting. But the best part of the film was the story.

Flicka is a real American film, and will have you laughing and crying. In the end, just like Katy's essay, you will be reminded that America is not about capitalism, stuffy politicians, expensive-suited businessmen, or any of the 9,000,000 other sterotypes. Katy McLaughlin (and Flicka) heart wrenchingly remind us that America is about freedom.

I walked out of the theater with tears, not just because of the story, but because of the story of America hidden within Flicka. And for this reason, it is a brilliant film.

Please, take yourself to see this film. Look at it as a story of America and freedom first and foremost, and within this story, a girl and a horse learn to ride. Flicka is an amazing piece of cinema.

1558601,5,B00005JOTJ,"It's a wonderfully written story about the relationship between a young girl and a wild Mustang that is later named Flicka. The symbolism between Katy and Flicka is center stage and shouldn't be confused with just a young girl rebelling against her father. She is her father! If you listen carefully, you'll see each character grow as the story plays out. The spirit of the independent lifestyle and the bonds of family are alive and well in America. It's a great film to watch with everyone.",1492819200,2,492,4.732558139534884

1558806,2,B00005JOTJ,"If you are a horse person, this is undoubtedly one of the worst horse movies ever made.  Even if you aren't horse knowledgeable, the plot is trivial and disjointed, the acting is really poor and the dialogue must have been written by a committee of 12 year olds.  I especially like how she just goes in the pen and holds out an apple to this wild mustang and it comes up to eat out of her hand, how the wild mustang just stands there and lets her try to put a hackamore on it, how she just jumps on her bareback for the first ride.  I could go on an on about other stupid, unbelievable stuff in the movie, but what's the point.  This one goes in the Goodwill box.",1473984000,2,663,4.076923076923077

Dad is a real jerk and sends the horse away, but it has a happy ending the horse comes back to the girl. Dad learns to accept his children as they are.

1560338,5,B00005JOTJ,From what I remember from the oringinal Flicka movie of years ago with Roddy McDowell this bears little resemblance to tnat. However on it's own merits I liked this story of a typical family with teenagers. The daughter had the great love of a wild but eventually tamed horse known as Flicka. What daughter & horse each had to experience with crisises was worth my time to watch. I liked it very much. Tim McGrath did a very good performance.,1402099200,,442,4.5375

1560627,5,B00005JOTJ,This is a movie about knowing who you are and striving to remain true to yourself. Katy is a young girl who cares most about her father's horse ranch and the horses on it.

1560631,1,B00005JOTJ,"This is not really a review, but more of a complaint. Why does Hollywood insist on using a familiar name even when the story is changed beyond anything remotely resembling the original story? This has happened time and again. I go to a movie thinking I'm going to see the original story, and oops, guess what? It's changed so much I don't recognize it.
Flicka was originally called My Friend Flicka and the orignal horse was a sorrel, not a black. The original character was a 10-year-old boy, not a female teenager. The ranch was located in southern Wyoming. The original story may be dated some, but that's no excuse to change it so much. The orignal movie starred Roddy McDowell as Ken, the original character. Go back to the original movie if you must, but please quit changing stories so you don't recognize them.",1378339200,6,818,4.6482758620689655

Now don't get me wrong, women/wives have a say and their opinion counts in a Christian household ( Even God told Abraham to listen to his wife Sarah) BUT I found it totally wrong that the wife was siding with her daughter ( in anger).

Also the son is very disrespectful.. ugh I could go on.. the Dad was just trying to do the right thing to keep his family safe but his whole family was against him. I never read the book but this movie version was horrible.

Also on top of it all , the girl should not have capture the horse in the beginning.. she made the horse suffer more then it had too.

1561016,5,B00005JOTJ,"Hmmm. Perhaps some reviewers did not watch the entire movie. All three of my daughters love this one, and we enjoyed it as well. Not at all like the original book, but still a great message about a father and daughter learning to understand each other. The father thinks his daughter is just being rebellious and lazy in her school work, but fails to recognize her kindred spirit in wanting to run the family ranch. He wrongly assumes the ranch will be passed down to his son. The daughter certainly disobeys her father and is met with a disastrous consequence to her rebellious act.

Tame enough for our three-year-old horse lover, although we leave the room near the end when the mountain lion attacks Flicka. (Parental warning: After the attack - it is not graphic - the father thinks he will need to shoot the horse, explaining that he does not want the animal to suffer. This is the climax of the film and provides the suspense prior to the happy ending. If your children do not like suspenseful movies this will upset them.) At no point in the film is the teenage daughter transformed into a subservient child like one negative reviewer wrote.

That surprised me because it involves a rebellious teenage girl and usually that in itself is enough to turn me off.  However, this particular girl didn't irritate me quite as bad.  Maybe Allison Lohman (Katy McLaughlin) is just that good.  Or maybe I could relate to what she was going through, being a horse lover myself. :)  I think Tim McGraw does a great job in this movie as well, playing a protective father (Rob McLaughlin).  I like how he actually yells at his daughter, instead of letting her get her own way like 90% of movies these days.  Maria Bello...eh....I didn't like her that much, but now that I've watched the movie a couple times, I can't really imagine anyone else playing the mother (Nell McLaughlin)  Ryan Kwanton is quite easy on the eyes and I thought he played the part of older brother (Howard McLaughlin) very well.  I actually really enjoyed the relationship he has with his sister - made me want an older brother. :D  Overall, rather good film.

It's not just that they swapped a headstrong teenage girl for the book's original young, quiet, sensitive boy. We both just thought the girl in the movie was a horrible, spoiled, annoying, selfish brat. We couldn't abide her and so no amount of pretty horses could make up for her one-dimensional character. The book is so lovely, so nuanced--it's a gem that wasn't even adequately portrayed by the 1940s ""classic"" version of the story.

They could have found an original script about horses, I think, instead of more ""remake-itis"" that Hollywood is stuck in right now. Rent the 1943 version and the 1945 sequel  ""Thunderhead.""

They're old movies, but they can't be improved upon. The technicolor of the Big Outdoors is sumptuous, the horse stunts nearly impossible to tell they were staged as when Flicka's mother rears under the sign while she's being trucked out and brains herself. Or when baby Flicka escapes the barn by breaking through a glass window and jumping out and the heart rendering scene where she is caught in the barbed wire fence. Can't watch either of these movies without a BIG box of kleenex!  Flawless horse training for movies as was the fight to the death of Thunderhead and the Albino in the sequel. PLus there was the music score by the great Alfred Newman whose son, Thomas Newman, did the superb score to Horse Whisperer.

If your horse-loving daughters really need to see a horse movie, get them training tapes by the gentle and effective trainers out there such as Pat Parelli, Chris Cox, Clinton Anderson, etc. At least they'll learn something.

1561205,3,B00005JOTJ,"""Flicka"" (2006) bridges several sub-genres, unfortunately it is one of the weakest examples of each. It's a horse movie (the original is better, as are ""National Velvet"", The Horse Whisperer"" and for that matter most episodes of the Saddle Club and ""Spin & Marty""). It's a 'wild mustangs as a metaphor for the changing West"" movie (""The Misfits"" and ""Billy Jack"" do it better). It's an overwrought coming of age melodrama (countless other films do this better as well as most of the stuff you find playing on Lifetime).

It's also an Alison Lohman film and in all fairness contains one of her best performances. Lohman is always excellent and in ""Flicka"" she is given a lot to work with and handles it all quite well but the scripting and editing are so weak that her strong performance (and nice supporting work by Maria Bello and Ryan Kwanten) cannot turn this thing into a quality film. You might notice that neither the two screenwriters nor the director have been involved in any feature productions since the release of the film.

""Flicka"" was a major release (over 2900 theaters in the U.S.) and turned a profit at the box office. I credit shrewd packaging by the film's producers as they focused from inception on insuring that the project would be bankable. They incorporated elements that pre-sold the film beyond its target audience of pre-teen girls. Tim McGraw was cast to bring in his large fan base, Kwanten was counted on to draw a fair number of teenage girls into the multi- plex, and there are so few live action family films in 2006 that it tapped into this under-supplied market.

Although Mary O'Hara's beloved children's book (My Friend Flicka-previously adapted into two feature films and a television show, is credited) it would be more accurate to say ""inspired by"" rather than ""adapted from"". The original's ten-year-old hero has been changed to a 16-year-old heroine named Katy McLaughlin (Lohman).

I normally rant a bit when an older actress is cast as a teenager but Lohman is the Mary Pickford of her day and with her cute face and freckles still looks physically believable playing a teen. Her new look for the film, long curly hair-dyed dark, makes her look a lot like Kari Russell (insert ""very Irish"" here). In this remake it's totally Katy's story (in the original the parents had a more central role) and is told from her point-of-view. She even does a short voice-over commentary to begin and close the film. Normally this POV stuff leads to viewer identification and connection, but the scripting and directing works against Lohman and you stay distanced from her character.

Katy is mega-headstrong, uncomfortable and bored at her boarding school but at one with the wilds of her family's horse ranch in Wyoming. Her father is grooming Katy's older brother Howard to eventually take over the ranch, clueless about Howard's desire to escape and about Katy's affinity for the place. She is the chip-off-the-old-block, not her brother.

The title character is a two-year old black mustang mare that is a source of conflict between Katy and her father for most of the film. While the movie looks pretty the thin plot, the poor sequencing, and absence of ""genuine"" emotion"" doesn't add up to a particularly satisfying viewing experience.

1561306,3,B00005JOTJ,"""Flicka"" is a Y2K version of the children's classic ""My Friend Flicka,"" which is part of a trilogy set on a ranch in Wyoming. The book's protagonist is male and somewhat younger than the ""teenage"" girl, Katy, here. Alison Lohman does a decent job, but she can't overcome the fact that she looks WAY older than a teen. I mean, some actors you can suspend disbelief and others you just can't. The other actors do a good job with the cliched material, but another problem is that Katy's brother looks only slightly younger than her father.  This really should have been corrected because it dampens the drama between the son and dad, who have a major conflict going.

Anyway, like the kid in the book, Katy is quite the daydreamer because she would prefer to be riding on the range than going to boarding school. She seems to be on good terms with her classmates, but she winds up failing a final, and returns home to thunderclouds. Literally and figuratively. Then she spots a wild mare running free and falls in love. Will she tame the beast and prove to her dad that mustangs aren't trouble? Will she show everyone that girls can ride just as well as boys, and have the potential to take over the family ranch?  Have you ever seen a horse movie before?

There are also lots of ballad style songs, sung by the dad, Tim McGraw, that seem to well up at the slightest provocation. The symbolism is always crystal clear, too, so you don't have to worry about missing anything. Good for a rainy day, but there are so many other horse movies out there. I'd recommend ""The Black Stallion"" instead. Or better yet, read the books. And please. Before you go climbing up on your neighbor's wild horse when no one's looking, wear a hard hat. Forget the romance of your hair flying out, and avoid a possible concussion. Thank you.",1184457600,5,1816,4.527439024390244
1561307,2,B00005JOTJ,"Whoever green-lit this remake needs to be horsewhipped. Now I don't expect every viewer to be coming from my perspective--I read the 1941 novel My Friend Flicka, watched the 1943 movie many times throughout my childhood and, like the protagonist of the story, broke my own horse to ride. However, I do expect that anyone with an iota of horse sense will immediately agree that this is one lame remake.

The basics are in place: a horse-raising family living in Wyoming struggles to hold onto their ranch while their dreamy youngest child latches onto a wild mustang and becomes convinced that their fates are intertwined. There, the similarities end.

In the update, 12-year-old Ken has morphed into 16-year-old Katy (Alison Lohman), and Flicka, once a delicate sorrel filly we met as a foal and watched grow into a racehorse, is portrayed by a fully-grown, massive black male horse (though he is still referred to as a ""she""). Apparently, once Ken lost his manhood, he also lost his ability to ride: Katy falls off of Flicka so many times, head injuries are the only explanation for her incredibly stupid behavior throughout the movie.

If you are hoping, at least, for any semblance of authenticity when it comes to the horsey scenes, forget it. For months, Flicka lives in a roundpen with no feeder, no water bucket and no shelter. Katy has no idea how to properly break and train a horse, but of course Flicka--after a stint in the rodeo, no less--plods along like she's a Pony Rides veteran.

Add to all of the above: over-wrought performances (even the horse overacts!), ding-bat dialogue, and a never-ending barrage of New-Agey songs set to dramatic montages, and you've got the ""Flicka"" remake. No wonder two horses died during the production of this film--they probably committed suicide.

The only saving grace for this DVD is a delightful photo slide-show of real girls and their horses, which plays out through the end-credits. It's much more stirring and heartwarming than the film itself.

Tim McGraw's performance as the headstrong, disciplined father is ok, but an actor such as Chris Cooper would have been a much wiser choice. Alison Lohman's performance is good at times and average at others.  Some of her lines and predicaments seem too contrived.  Lohman's rodeo scene reminds me of something that Lucy would have done in an ""I Love Lucy"" episode. Aside from that, the other rodeo scenes look as if they were filmed during an actual Wyoming rodeo. The tension and misunderstandings between Katy (the Lohman character) and her father are not brought out enough to evoke empathy, sympathy, or even an emotional understanding. The scenes between Katy and her mother (Maria Bello) and brother (Ryan Kwanten) are well acted. The beautiful open ranges of Wyoming are captured nicely in this film.

1561407,3,B00005JOTJ,"'Flicka' provides Middle America with staple entertainment: Beauty for the eyes and ears, convincing performances, and a classic story. Country singer Tim McGraw could quit his day job (although it would be foolish, and he punches both clocks for this movie anyway). Maria Bello has the most well-rounded and likable performance as the mother. The screenwriters, however, bring a mixed blessing to this version. They update the story in many proper ways--including the diminishing livelihood of ranch living, but the conflict is flawed.

Gorgeous Wyoming is the backdrop where underachiever Katie McGlaughlin (Alison Lohman) comes home from boarding school. She's in love with the ranch, while her agreeable sibling Howard wants to trade the chaps for college duds. Incorrigible from the start, she does everything her way. Shirking her duties, she takes off at dawn for a horse ride, only to find a black mustang who keeps her from harm. The conflict is a tug-of-war between her stubborn defiance against her father (McGraw) who can't keep himself from offering advice that's in everyone's best interest--including protecting his hard-earned livelihood. She wants to have a pet horse at the expense of everyone and everything within any bounds of reason. Even though she considers Flicka her other self, it is hard to reconcile.

The problem with 'Flicka' is that we're supposed to sympathize with Katie and the horse. She's meant to be the misunderstood rebel, and her father, while strict, is meant to be a tyrant, but the tension doesn't work (which isn't McGraw's fault). How we're supposed to like the girl and the horse is a mystery, but anyone rational at least has to side with the parents. (Even though it must be conceded that the night scenes where she trains the horse are convincing and effective.)  Nevertheless, the movie should be judged by the results, rather than the intentions. 'Flicka' is a likably pleasant ride through Wyoming and good family entertainment, even if the film prevents us from liking either the girl or the horse (not Lohman's fault--her spirited performance is very good--even if her character is hard to like).  Katie's attempts to tame the horse are sharply drawn and convincing. Cynics could advise to buy the sountrack and a Wyoming travel video; then, just skip the movie. (By the way the former has everything from a good score to McGraw to Donovan. ""Catch the Wind"" cleverly fits a scene beautifully!) But there's more going for the movie than mere garnish. A few tender father-daughter scenes, a solid story still intact, and an affinity for just about everyone else helps to save 'Flicka'.",1176336000,2,2638,5.085450346420323

1561410,3,B00005JOTJ,"Whenever I hear of a new horse movie being produced, I feel two mixed emotions - hope and skepticism, at the same time. I love horses, and I love a good horse story, but so many equestrian movies are overly romanticized and juvenilized, probably in anticipation of an audience comprised mostly of horse-crazy, pre-teen girls. And unfortunately, that's exactly the audience this movie would appeal to, and probably the only audience it would appeal to. ""Flicka"" is loosely based on the classic young adult novel ""My Friend Flicka"" by Mary O'Hara. Having read the book twice - once in my childhood and again last year when I heard of the upcoming movie - I was curious as to how the film would compare. The book tells the story of 9-year-old Ken McLaughlin, the son of a Wyoming rancher, who desperately wants a horse of his own. However, he is doing dismally in school and repeatedly makes mistakes around the ranch, and his father insists that he must begin demonstrating some personal responsibility. Finally he agrees that Ken can have a horse, in hopes that taking on the care of an animal will help him develop more maturity, but to his dismay, the boy sets his heart on an unmanageable filly he names Flicka, and an intense mental and emotional father-son struggle ensues.

The movie, however, is quite different. While the same basic theme of impulsive, horse-crazy child vs. traditional rancher father is preserved, huge changes have been made to the plotline. The most obvious of these is that the main character has been switched from a 9-year-old boy to a 16-year-old girl. The film begins with the family being notified that Katy (Alison Lohman) is being held back a year in school due to her failure to complete a final essay. In hopes of postponing the inevitable confrontation with her father (Tim McGraw), Katy goes for a trail ride and encounters a mountain lion. Conveniently, a lone mustang appears and runs the creature off. Katy, enraptured by this mysterious horse, rushes home and asks her father to bring the filly in. Having just gotten word of Katy's failure in school, he predictably says no. So Katy runs off and tries to capture the horse herself. Not surprisingly, she bungles the attempt, and her father ends up bringing the filly in after all, if only to keep her from joining and ""ruining"" his own herd of Quarter Horses. He orders Katy to stay away from the filly so, also rather predictably, she begins sneaking out to the corral at night, leading to a further cascade of events that build more and more tension between girl and father.

Ironically, the change in the main character's age is probably the biggest thing that keeps the story from being plausible. The writers simply did not adjust the dialogue or behavior to fit an older character. As a result, we see a 16-year-old girl acting like a child. Is dissolving into tearful screaming fits and declaring hatred for one's father each time something doesn't go the way you'd like a good way to convince one's parents that you're mature and capable and deserve to be rewarded? Not likely. Katy's father is not an ogre, and the film makes it very clear that he cares about his family, but Katy's explosions would be enough to turn any parent off. Behavior like this may be understandable in a 9-year-old (though even Ken in the book doesn't throw fits like his movie counterpart does), but a 16-year-old should know better. A 16-year-old raised on a ranch should also have some amount of common sense around horses, but Katy does not. She just hauls herself aboard the wild horse one night, not taking any time to condition the filly to the feel of a foreign body on her back and, predictably, is promptly deposited in the dirt. When Flicka finally does accept Katy as a rider, the girl decides it would be a great time to open the gate and go for a trail ride. And when Flicka, seeing her pathway to freedom opened, takes off at a gallop, what does Katy do to try to get her to stop? She begins screaming her head off.

Other changes, too, have been made to the story. In the movie, Flicka is a lone mustang that one day appears out of nowhere. In the book, Flicka is a part of McLaughlin's herd, only 1/4 mustang, the progeny of the ranch's Quarter Horse stallion Banner and the 1/2 mustang broodmare, Rocket. The original story is much more plausible, for it would be highly odd for a fully wild mustang to be found wandering alone. Horses are herd animals and for a wild horse to be separated from its herd is dangerous to its own survival. The other thing that really had me cringing was Flicka's incessant screaming and squealing after she is brought back to the ranch. Whereas domestic horses will whinny at each other in greeting and so forth, wild horses make very little noise, as doing so would alert predators. Anyone who has adopted a mustang can tell you that these horses are generally much quieter than their domestic counterparts. And as the movie progresses, the plotline deviates further and further from the original, until there are few parallels at all. In addition, just as Flicka's behavior in the film is unrealistic, so is that of the human characters. The dialogue is often juvenile and idealistic, and just not very believable.

Now, just to explain why I still gave the movie some stars, I'll refer back to my previous comment about it appealing to young, horse-crazy children, which is true. I probably would have loved this one when I was a kid. It is the kind of ambitious, take-on-the-world story that captures children's imaginations, and at that age they are unlikely to pick up on the unrealistic aspects. As far as loyalty to the book, I have been told that the older (1943) adaptation with Roddy McDowall as Ken is much better, but I have not seen it myself and so cannot give personal feedback. Finally, the DVD offers only a few special features. There is director commentary, a music video of Tim McGraw's ""My Little Girl,"" outtakes, and three deleted scenes, only one of which (the extended bedtime conversation between Katy's parents) really lends anything to the story. Both widescreen and fullscreen viewing options are available. To conclude, I'd really only recommend this one to families with younger, horse-loving children. While it isn't the worst horse movie I've seen, I don't foresee it appealing to a very large adult audience. For older viewers seeking a good horse movie, ""Seabiscuit"" remains my favorite of those produced in recent years.",1175904000,28,6485,4.741364038972542

1561734,4,B00005JOTJ,"Watch this flick (sorry, couldn't resist) with the expectation of a good, gritty, girl-and-her-horse movie, and you won't be disappointed. Forget it was based on the best-selling 1941 novel My Friend Flicka by Mary O'Hara. The creative license taken in changing Ken McLaughlin to Katy McLaughlin might be too much for fans of the book, or even for those expecting a re-make of the 50's movie starring Roddy McDowell.

Sixteen-year-old Katy McLaughlin (Alison Lohman) is all you'd expect of a Wyoming rancher's daughter. She's feisty, head-strong, and opinionated. More like her father (Country music's Tim McGraw) than either of them realizes. While out riding one morning, Katy finds a young mustang and instantly bonds with the creature. Determined to catch and tame the horse, she's even willing to risk her father's wrath and do it behind his back if that's what it takes. Needless to say, things don't go as planned. Dad finds out, is less than thrilled, and sells Flicka in front of a begging, pleading Katy. How far will Katy go to get Flicka back?

Katy herself is like a wild mustang, which is why, perhaps, she connects so deeply with Flicka. ""We're the same,"" Katy says at one point in the movie. They're both loners who don't fit in, they both buck authority, and Katy's father doesn't know what to do with either of them. As Katy writes in her school essay (a summer assignment to keep her from flunking) about the early settlers and their dealings with mustangs, ""They couldn't domesticate them, so they destroyed them . . . no one really wants them. Not ranchers, not city people. Let them disappear once and for all, along with all the other misfits and loners and relics of a wilderness no one cares about anymore."" The words hit home as we realize they apply not only to Flicka, but to Katy, too. A poignant reminder to go the extra mile and understand those who are different or don't fit the mold in our lives, rather than dismiss them.

Lohman (who's 27 in real life) delivers a solid performance playing a character over a decade her junior, though a few times the acting seemed a bit stilted, like she was trying too hard. Her Hollywood hair styles also felt out of place on a working horse ranch, but besides those tiny distractions, the authenticity of the character, and the ranch, was totally there. Tim McGraw played stern Rob McLaughlin as well as any professional actor, and Maria Bello's supporting role as Katy's mom brought some kinder (and funnier) moments to the film.

Family friendly through and through (the PG rating is for some mild language), it was refreshing to watch the affectionate brother-sister interaction of Katy and older brother Howard (Ryan Kwanten), her only real confidant on the ranch. I was also pleasantly surprised the film makers didn't resort to adding the teen romance subplot which seemed to be implied in the trailers. Howard does have a girlfriend, and their relationship seems out of place in the story at first, but everything ties together in the end as the girlfriend plays a role in the climactic scene.

Flicka is an enjoyable, feel-good western. There's just something about horses--they exude a power and freedom no other creature matches. And there's also something about the American West with its stark beauty and harsh realities. Flicka showcases them both with beautiful cinematography (several shots of running horses and mountains are breathtaking), painting a realistic picture of the struggles modern-day ranchers face in an age that often forgets them, and the mustangs. Katy's essay says it best: ""...they [mustangs] are the hope for some kind of living memory of what the promise of America used to be ... and could be again.""

1561735,3,B00005JOTJ,"With sumptuous Wyoming scenery and beautiful horses, FLICKA is a retread of the popular book, movie and tv series.  The movie sets no new ground in the story of a young free spirited girl who battles her stern father to tame a wild mustang that saved her from a mountain lion.

Pert Alison Lohman (MATCHSTICK MEN) plays the heroine, who is determined to go against her father's wishes and tame and ride the mustang Flicka.  Country superstar Tim McGraw (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) makes an okay dad, but he doesn't possess a wide emotional range.  Maria Bello is very good as usual in her role as the supportive wife and mother.

While entertaining in its genre, the movie doesn't really have a lot of dramatic impetus but the family will probably enjoy it.",1171843200,,751,4.659090909090909

1561798,4,B00005JOTJ,"Sometimes Hollywood tries too hard to stay near the feeling of an original movie when producing the modern version.  This time they took the chance to bring it to the modern era and some of the realities of twenty-first century living. Flicka, was a surprisingly delightful and original ""remake"".

 Generational controversies has always been around and we're still dealing with them today.  This story ushered in some of our real life difficulties today.  Flicka takes that gap and reveals it through the harshness of an ""old-school"" rancher and his modern minded kids.  The family ranching tradition seems to be in jeopardy until the horse comes on the scene.

There's some imitative behaviour you might want to be careful of if your kids pick that kind of thing up easily.  The two teen-aged children have discussions about hating their dad.  The star character openly screams at her father, "" I hate you"" and ""your not my father anymore"".  In another major portion of the movie she defies her father's wishes and enters the wild horse race to get her way.  When the cat gets out of the bag, she runs off on the back of her beloved Flicka.

I am a 23 year old horsewomen who happened to love this movie. Sure it was a little predictable, but it was beautifully made. I know there are people on here from a site called ""MY DEAD FLICKA"", yes 2 horses died...in a FREAK accident. Very few people realize how little it takes for a horse to spook and in an effort to flee, harm themselves severely. It is my understanding that one horse spooked and stepped on their own lead rope breaking their neck. Things like this happen when dealing with domesticated, but still WILD animals. I love horses and most animals and do not in any way condone abuse or neglect, but I think that if you are going to spend time protesting something, get over the movie and start looking into the situation at Premarin horse farms (where mares are repeatedly impregnated and abused in an effort to obtain pregnant mare urine to make a prescription drug) Premarin farms kill thousands, maybe even millions of horses every year and this movie only claimed 2. Do you also protest at rodeos where animals are riled, strapped and kicked to get them to buck for entertainment value?

I had a newborn and was unable to go and see the movie.

I want to speak on behalph of Tim McGraw.

Anyone that knows Tim McGraw and follows his career and apreciates his talent and his charitable efforts, knows him.

If you know Tim you would know that he would not have completed this film nor continued to be apart of it if horses were being abused in the making of this film.

If you know Tim, you know he's not just a celebrity but past the stardom lights he is a real person that has an undying love for his wife, children, family, friends, his ranch, his horses. That's right he owns a ranch with horses.

Tim would never be apart of something that caused cruilty to horses much less any animal, not just because of the character that he is but he would not represent himself that way to his children.

He's loved by millions, and has a repiutation and everything he does, weither a part in a film or a song he sings, he would not do it unless it had meaning, and something he believed in.

I also want to say to the guy that claims he worked on the set. Buddy get real. Fox and Tim could sue you for slander.

Let's face it I'm sure that horses have died in prior fims, and accidental injuries weither it be bulls, sheep, cows or people, when there is a stampede someone will get hurt.

You know I support him and his wife in all they do. And if you see them as the people they are  then you know their true reality and what they stand for.

I think it's more important to spend your time in efforts of stopping REAL animal abuse, you could start in your own neighborhood. I mean there are real animal abuse cases that are alarming and more needs to be done. Daily animals suffer til their death. But I guess it's more important to spend time glorrifying an accident on a movie set that caused 2 deaths because suddenly people see $ dollar signs.

I mean face it any movie that shows an animal the activists run around like their pants on fire. You need to care about real cases with real evidence not rumors that make big bucks talking about it in the tabloids.

So while you may think you will acomplish getting people fired up over animal abuse and persuade folks to not buy the dvd, you won't win this fan over.

I will support this film and Tim McGraw.

People are inclined to make their own opions and their own decisions.

Here's a clue, you don't like it...don't watch it!

Gee...that's real hard isn't it? I guess it's more fun to pick apart someone else's talent so you can make yourself feel better.

1561944,2,B00005JOTJ,"The fact that two horses reportedly died during the making of FLICKA is an irrelevance. This film is otherwise so juvenile that only an adolescent female and her horse could love it - i.e., 5 star ""family entertainment"". For the adult world, which I like to think includes myself, it may be one of the more forgettable films of 2006 - 2 stars.

Katy McLaughlin (Alison Lohman) attends a pricey, boarding prep school in Wyoming. Returning home at the scholastic term's end, she must figure out how to tell her parents, horse ranchers in deep hock because of the tuition and hard business times, that her performance on a final essay was so dismal that she's being academically held back a year. Her Mom and older brother, Nell (Maria Bello) and Howard (Ryan Kwanten) respectively, are sympathetic. Her Dad, Rob (Tim McGraw), is angry and disgusted.

Her first morning back on the spread, Katy goes horseback riding and is thrown from her mount by a cougar, which is subsequently scared off by a lone mustang. Being rescued by the animal ensures Katy's love for it, and she gallops forth again the next day to rope the horse and make it her own. She only succeeds in driving the mustang into one of her father's domestic herds, stampeding the latter. After the dust dies down, the mustang is captured and brought back to a prison corral up by the Big House. Rob wants to sell the beast to a rodeo; Katy names her Flicka and wants to keep and train it. Considering Katy's low standing with Ol' Dad at the moment, the subsequent conflict between father and daughter is, well, as strident as you can imagine.

The best part of FLICKA is the gorgeous Wyoming scenery, though, with the tell-tale oak trees, the set looks suspiciously at times like coastal California. Indeed the big time rodeo ostensibly set at the Wyoming State Fair more resembles an event staged for the camera in Simi Valley just north of Los Angeles. The storyline was otherwise oh so predictable: the mortal perils encountered by Katy and her hoss, Katy's ""I'll show you"" rebellion against Rob's hard-headedness, Nell's ""good-guy"" approach to parenting contrasting Rob's ""bad-guy"" routine, and the caught-in-the-middle positions forced upon Howard and the two ranch hands. At one point, when Katy is sick and Flicka grievously injured, the former gives Rob permission to shoot them both. My thought was, ""Oh, please, pull the trigger and put me out of my misery.""

20th Century Fox was excoriated by animal lovers for the deaths of the two horses during production, and the resultant bad press undoubtedly had its PR department spinning into overtime. The ironic thing is, if the studio vows to never again to do another schmaltzy pony epic, it'll be because of the bad PR experience, not because the script was too silly to begin with and shouldn't even have escaped from whatever production meeting approves such things.",1167955200,14,2888,4.828282828282828

If you KNOW horses, as we do... you will also know that they are prey animals that can be spooked quite easily in unfamiliar surroundings. I know, without a doubt, that no horse owner intends for their horse to get hurt, yet sometimes it happens and sometimes, like in the case of impalement on something (like a fence post, tree limb, etc.) they may even die from their injuries. Do NOT boycott this movie... as it would only rob you of getting an inside look of how horses and horse lovers interact with each other. It would also rob you of seeing some of the most touching father/daughter interaction I have ever seen! Great acting, beautiful scenery, and GORGEOUS horses!",1167264000,2,802,4.5

Before taking too much stock in the bad review due to the death of two horses, I would want to know how the horses died. Seemed to me the movie promoted saving horses.

At any rate, I loved the movie!",1167264000,2,360,3.986111111111111

No matter how good the movie might be, there is no reason to support an evil company that does this. Oh, and regardless of what fans of this movie write here, Flicka was pretty much panned by critics and didn't do well at the box office; I had predicted that Flicka would be the ""Gigli of 2006"" and it didn't even do as well as that flop.",1167177600,11,602,4.016666666666667

Read the book instead, or even better, plan a family trip to a horse rescue. That way you won't be hurting the very thing you're there to see.",1167091200,10,535,4.235294117647059

My name is Roland Windsor Vincent.  I'm an attorney and I own and love horses.  Last year I was an extra on the set of the Fox Films' shoot of Flicka, and witnessed the cruel use of horses in what is known as a ""Wild Horse Race.""  Wranglers chase frightened horses around a ring, and try to drag them down and mount them.  The horses are terrified, and in the case I witnessed one was tripped on its rope, kicked in the head, and died an agonizing death.  There was absolutely no justification for subjecting horses to this inhumane treatment, except to shoot a sensational scene to make money for Fox. This was the second horse to die at the hands of Fox in the re-make of My Friend Flicka. You can get the whole story by googling ""Flicka Horse Death.""

When I broke the story to the news media, Fox offered me $2500 to keep quiet!

Just as disturbing was the fact that the film's star, Tim McGraw, hasn't had the guts to even comment on the death of that poor horse.  I had been a big fan of Tim McGraw, and I'm sure many of us now are terribly disappointed in him. Shame on you, Tim!
