2811162,1,B000P5FH4Y,"Bad, boring, and deffinitely not accurate.  If you want a false representation of the mormon chuch, this is just the video for you.  I was very disappointed in PBS and I'm questioning the accuracy of their other programs in which I know little about.",1180483200,11,250,4.659090909090909
2811163,4,B000P5FH4Y,"This video, recently seen on PBS, is balanced and fairly comprehensive.  It gives enough history to put the LDS church in perspective through the years.  The 'story' moves along fast enough that an overall picture was developed before the viewer was overwhelmed or became disinterested.  It is well worth watching again!!",1178496000,19,321,5.254901960784314
2811164,5,B000P5FH4Y,"Whether you are a believer in the Mormon faith, a skeptic, or are generally unfamiliar with this Christian denomination, you should be able to appreciate this in-depth documentary about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

This documentary, produced by PBS Frontline & American Experience, does not try to promote the faith for purposes of expanding its membership, but it takes an unbiased path to explain the Mormon religion from a historical perspective.

The lengthy documentary cover many issues regarding very relevant aspects of Mormon history and modern Mormon culture. Many opinions from knowledgeable historians are offered to help dispel the myths & misunderstandings about the faith. There are many positive aspects about the church that are introduced to those unfamiliar with Mormonism. Several topics discussed may not sit well with some modern members and believers, but they need to keep in mind that the pursuit of truth is not about denying or hiding from factual history, but about telling the whole story whether or not it is a source of pride or a source of embarrassment.

""The Mormons"" deserves to be watched with an open mind, in the spirit for which it was produced. It is an important and very relevant part of our American history, whether you are a believer or not.",1178236800,58,1307,5.069767441860465
2811165,1,B000P5FH4Y,"The first two hours of this documentary were a revealing look at the tenants of the mormon religion. The film basically mocks mormon beliefs....AND THEN spends the last 15 minutes proselytising christian beliefs and how to turn mormons into christians. A note to the christian filmmakers......people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. If you are going to make fun of one religion's story and beliefs, you should be able to defend yours as well. I was duped into watching this two hour commercial for christianity. The first two hours are interesting and informative.....the last fifteen minutes.....be forewarned.",1496534400,,618,5.381443298969073

2811169,1,B000P5FH4Y,"As a member of the LDS church and former minister of a non-denominational Christian church, I can tell you that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints is the true church of God on the earth today and that the priesthood and all of the saving ordinances have been restored at the hand of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Salvation by Grace or by Grace and Works? Philippians 2:12 ""Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."" James 2:17 ""Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."" Matthew 7:20 -24 ""Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:""

Did Christ atone for man's sins on the Cross or in the Garden? Yes, in a word. The atonement was and remains a process. Christ suffered in the Garden, he suffered in the Jail - his stripes and crown of thorns, everything that was undergone by the Lord during the time of the atonement was part of the process, the prophet Isaiah records in the 53 chapter of his book: ""But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."" Christ suffered a weight so mighty in the garden that according to Luke that he was attended by an angel who strengthened him, his agony causing his sweat to be great drops of blood falling on the ground... He shed his blood that we might be saved, he bore such a weight, the weight of our sins, pains, troubles, fears, etc... in the garden... the final price of sin, death - was paid on the cross, that everyone may freely receive the gift of the resurrection.

This video is another poor attempt to put the doctrines of salvation into a dark light, at best it is a misunderstanding of the truth at worst it is an outright lie on the level the ""The Godmakers.""",1490054400,2,2410,4.339246119733924

2811171,2,B000P5FH4Y,"This seems more biased than informative. While informative, it shows the point of view of those who are against the Mormons. There is also a lot of inaccurate information in this film.",1489881600,,184,4.78125
2811172,5,B000P5FH4Y,if you're Mormon and reading this please read Ephesians 2:8-10. This documentary exposes the nastiness of this cult and how they pervert the christian bible. Really gives you a great incite to truth about mormonism. Well thought out and factual. Very nice to hear the details of the evilness behind the mormon church from former members.,1489795200,,337,5.035714285714286
2811173,1,B000P5FH4Y,"I thought this was going to be an objective video that presents different points of view, but this is a very one-sided approach.  Seems like it's really just meant to scare you away from ever talking to Mormons.  WARNING - They will suck you into some vortex of evil polygamy, extra scriptures, flawed prophets, blasphemy and green Jello.  (OK, they said nothing about green Jello)  But seriously, what a shame.  Why not try to promote faith?
Some of these things in here are true, but some of them are either untrue or wildly embellished.  And yes I've actually studied a lot of Mormon history over the last couple decades, including the unvarnished versions.  I found many things in here to be simply a person's point of view presented as absolute and undeniable fact.  There is a lot of room for difference of opinion left completely unexplored in this video.  Really, it's unfortunate.
I never understood why Mormons are somehow disqualified from being Christians.  I get the impression that some churches just want to hold a monopoly on who they'll accept as ""Christians"" and scandalize everyone else who has a differing point of view.  This video helps confirm that suspicion.  What more is there than simply accepting Jesus as your personal Savior?
Somehow, Amazon labeled this video under ""comedy.""  If it weren't so sad, I'd say it was appropriate.  However you want to label it is fine, as long as it's not under non-fiction.",1487808000,2,1435,4.851851851851852
2811174,2,B000P5FH4Y,"If you thought Scientology is weird then study Mormonism. There's little difference between L. Ron Hubbard and Joseph Smith as both were hucksters.

So if the regular belief in virgin births, floods, magic men, walking zombies, and talking serpents and donkeys aren't crazy enough for you, try Mormonism. ""Magic Underwear"" is available in the lobby on your way out of the theater.",1487289600,,380,5.129032258064516
2811175,5,B000P5FH4Y,"I've seen this documentary (all four hours) twice, now, and I think it's one of the best introductions to the faith, especially in the context of American religions. There are a lot of people on here who are saying the documentary isn't valid due to it's ""one-sidedness"" or ""anti-Mormon"" platform. Much of the rhetoric that follows in such reviews has an idiosyncratic, Mormon tone to it; some even bare testimony. The critique that this isn't a fair look at Mormonism is likely due to the fact that the documentary actually does a very nice job presenting ""both"" sides of the faith (as if there are only two). Generally speaking, Mormons tend to feel that they are under attack if people don't agree with them or if a feature such as this one doesn't speak from a faith-building perspective. It's simply not true that the documentary is one-sided. The film spends a healthy amount of time in the second part with the question of why Mormons believe families are forever (so to speak), with a very moving treatise on a family with a daughter battling a serious, life-threatening illness. The documentary follows them, showing how their beliefs support them during the struggle. I have taught world religions at the college level and often recommend students watch this documentary to get a good sense of how religions start: Mormonism is the best prototype, in my view, given the historical records that are available to us (vs., say, Islam, or even Sikhism, where records are not available to us in such abundance, but also represent religions that begin in ways that parallel the Mormons). I highly recommend it!",1486857600,3,1614,4.872727272727273

2811181,4,B000P5FH4Y,"Thoroughly enjoyed. Having visited SLC multiple times, I have become increasingly interested in the history of LDS. Plus the popularity of TLC Sister Wives and A&E Escaping Polygamy, makes me curious. Another great book to read is the 19th Wife.",1484697600,,245,5.15
2811182,1,B000P5FH4Y,"I would have really liked to hear comments from practicing Mormons who stayed faithful to their church, as opposed to those who felt like they were the ""enlightened ones"" having left the faith. Most Mormons I have met aren't ignorant and gullible, as is pervasively implied throughout this film. If you ask me, my Mormon friends remind me a lot of the persecuted believers in the New Testament of the Holy Bible, which people suffered at the hands of the Scribes, Pharisees, otherwise ""experts"" of their time who simply lacked faith in Jesus, and chose to incite people against Him. They likewise accused Jesus of being a mad man, an inciter, a heretic, a liar, false prophet, etc. Somehow His followers still believed Him, no matter what the ""experts"" claimed!

I try to do a lot of reflection on ""documentaries"" when I watch them and found a very profound set of writings in Isaiah from the Holy Bible. This is taken from the 29th Chapter of Isaiah, and what I feel, relates very well to rebut all accusations and prerogatives of those interviewed in this film :

9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
 10 For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
 12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
 13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
 14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
 15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
 16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
 17 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
 19 The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
 20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
 21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
 22 Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
 23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
 24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

To the best of my knowledge, the LDS Church has not suppressed information surrounding Joesph Smiths actions in the printing press incident, or other areas of his life. While acknowledging that Joseph Smith was a Prophet, he was also a man, and all men make mistakes.  The destruction of the printing press, which led to his arrest, was one of the mistakes made by the man Joseph Smith, not the Prophet Joseph Smith, acting on Gods command.

They spend their whole life trying to work for favor with God, but the good news of the gospel is that it is a free gift of God. His grace is sufficient and Jesus is all you need. Not Jesus plus a works based system that places heavy burdens on people. Mormons are some of the most genuine people around but they need to know the pure message of the cross.

2811209,3,B000P5FH4Y,"The video was interesting -- in a one-sided debate sort of way.
Reading the reviews is probably more interesting:  It always hands me a laugh when people discuss something -- religion in this case -- which is a leap of faith, and in doing so get all sanctimonious, righteous and often, non-inclusive, about it, arguing at length about the minutiae of it; which, I suppose can be entertaining if it all means a lot to you.  But, what's with the common themes of almost every ex-Mormon's complaining of being so crestfallen when they find out some tiny piece of a puzzle doesn't fit, or that one of the founders had a character flaw, or that some recurring dogmatic theme or ceremonial custom wasn't totally original.  Spoiler alert:  the masons-inspired handshakes and symbols on the temple garments and the book of Abraham inspired themes in the book of Mormon -- that's devastating to learn?  Google ""Led Zeppelin"", read about their popularity and impact.  Then google ""Led Zeppelin, songs written or inspired by others"".  If you like their music, does reading that really make you like the music less?  If it does, you're naive.

It just sounds funny to read/listen to people in this great ingroup/outgroup debate, with clear inferiority/superiority implications (or outright explicit statements of such), when both sides seemed to have forgotten or be overlooking the notion that their initial premise was to have ""leapt to"" the belief that the universe was created in 6 days, that the earth is 6 or 7 thousand years old (hey folks, there are trees, currently living that are demonstrably (rings on samples counted; you know -- Science?) been proven to be that old and other living organisms are much older: the magnitude of error is equivalent to saying the U.S., from San Francisco to New York City, is 20 feet wide), that a 600 year old man (oh, and his son) built a boat large enough to hold pairs of all animals (insects, reptiles and birds included) and was able to gather them and figure out their diet and obtain enough of it for 40 days plus much longer in order for the water level to drop (back into what BTW?  Even if the poles melted the water level wouldn't rise above the mountain tops!  The amount of water on earth is always the same, it just changes form .  Did it go back into the layers under the earth's crust? WTH?), in fact, many animals (w/ short life cycles) would have had to have reproduced during all of that time), a trick even the best current zoologists can't do now for many species in captivity.

All of those seemingly outrageous 'asks' regarding a suspension of belief of almost all rationale and logic -- no problem.
But let Mormons practice a set of beliefs that include helping everyone, (even non Mormons; even atheists!) and carry out lifestyles that place a major emphasis on family, which, let's face it, is the core of pretty much everything societally-speaking, and many non Mormons just go nuts about it.  ""OMG, it's only ~180 years old!""  ""A guy in the 1800's had a vision and is their 'prophet'!  How hilarious and ridiculous.  Oh, they're a cult!""
Really?  The earth is really 6 billion years old, but the difference between: a bunch of prophets talking to God and writing it down (Old Testament) and then having it translated from Sanskrit to Hebrew to King James (or whatever) and then a son of the deity in the form of a man coming to earth 2 thousand yrs ago and dying, in order to give the people of the earth the opportunity of an afterlife (New Testament) [CHRISTIANS];
Versus ...
More or less all of the above (in the big picture/leap of faith about something HUGE in terms of implications for existence, but nearly deplete of any evidence), PLUS, a 'Part 3' to the Bible's Old & New Testaments, that is supposed to have been RE-discovered less than 200 years ago. [Mormons]
... that, that's what bothers the ""real"" Christians -- Those differences in 'facts' are the problem?

So yes, it is likely that it will be possible to do more fact-checking for something 180 years old vs 2,000-6,000 years, and come up with more discrepancies -- about the prophecy process as well as the quirks of the prophets.  Oh, but it's always J. Smith everyone has to pick on. Didn't the great and wonderful 'King David' intentionally, with great forethought, send the military officer of some woman he wanted to have his way with, to the front lines of a war, where he would have never been sent, given his rank, so that the guy would get killed, which he did?  Then, David's doing the guys widow?
But, Joseph Smith as a still relatively young man, allows a little local fame and power go to his head and he has and follows the same basic libidinal impulse as David, but at least he marries the women (ok, it's plural) -- he doesn't get their husbands' killed just so that he's ""not technically committing adultery"" (Dave's clever 'workaround' to lust satisfaction) and he's the pervert/sex criminal?  Now who's not being very even-handed ""real"" Christians?  They both just sound like today's version of them -- Politicians (and their sex scandals).
Ok, some of Joe S.'s wives were pretty young, but wasn't the average life expectancy back then about 40?  You start having kids at age 14 and keep pounding them out for 10-12 years (no reliable, safe birth control) and you die at 40 and your youngest is going to be 14-16 years old.  And, that's if you DO start young!  So, ...  Still, critics of Mormonism love to leave out the part that from the early beginnings of the church, the leaders were contentiously divided on the issue of polygamy, with the overwhelming majority vociferously against it.

Point is, the old adage, if religion didn't exist, someone would have invented it -- which is what they did.  Almost every society in every region of the world did.  And, they invented it because ...
1)  Most people find the notion that their consciousness, their ""them-ness"" will end at some point, unbearable (or they don't mind personally, but don't want to bum-out their kids when they ask them what happens when they die).
They can't just say: you know how it was, consciousness-wise, before you were born?  Wasn't all that bad right; didn't bother you?  Ok, so that's how it'll be after you die.
Do you have to be from like, Scandinavia to follow that logic [Note: area of the globe w/ highest proportion of atheists]?  Anyway, so they can't do that, so they make up something -- religion is born.
And/Or,
2)  People with a strong need for power, but who were neither born into it, nor had it physically (size, strength, warrior/fighter-type, etc.) had to come up with some way to get people with power to share that power, to let them live and not overpower them or seize their wife, kids, cattle, land, etc., just 'cause they could.  Saying, ""It's not fair"" wasn't working.  So, they had to 'Guilt them' into good behavior w/ the threat of everlasting damnation and torture.  And, they did that by coming up with a story of a wonderful afterlife that was only possible by living a just, fair, vice-free life on earth.  Otherwise, a hellish alternative.
Then later, more details got added as time went by to serve those religious people who had finally gotten a little equality and representation started thinking that a little power might be worth try.  Then, just like their atheist (or 'non' theist) predecessors, once they tasted a little power eventually found that they required a continual gain in social/political power, in order to keep law and order as population densities increased and competition for valued resources became greater and also to not have to get accustomed to pesky and aesthetically unpleasing minority groups and people with 'different ways' and customs (""Ew, that won't do.  We need some added doctrine to eliminate this nonsense!"").
So, the additions/amendments to the 'words from God' started getting really specific:  ""God spoke to me in another dream last night [sayeth the prophet] -- he said we must kill the gays!""

So anyway:
Yeah, sure, pick on the Mormons, like THEY'RE the strange ones -- what with their clean, white shirts and their bicycles and precise haircuts and patience and good will, THEY might ... love/help you to death!  How threatening!",1474934400,2,8241,4.7449194113524875

They will watch with their mouths open in disbelief. There are some transitions in the video that lead the watcher to pick out the slant against Mormonism, but let's be honest - it's hard to present a reasoned approach speaking to a religion set up based entirely on personal experience. Be courteous and loving when challenging them. They are amazing people loved by God... But lost up in seeking perfection instead of seeking the living and true God revealed in the bible alone.  Set up arguments as a ""this is what Jesus said"" and transpose it against ""this is what Joseph said"". They do not agree, so who is right?

2811260,1,B000P5FH4Y,"When anti-Mormons write books and make videos claiming to be objective, informational materials, this is what one gets. As a Mormon, myself (a convert), I read a great deal about the church, and I know more than the average LDS bear about our history, our doctrine and the evidence for and against the Book of Mormon. I find the faith logical, inspiring, consistent with first century Christianity, insightful and the evidence compelling, and I wouldn't say that casually or if I didn't believe it. Also, I doubt I would have immersed myself with it as much as I have if I hadn't been exposed to the grossly dishonest, misleading and manipulative tactics found in this work and similar books, websites and videos.

While watching Lynn Wilder's MORMONS, I found myself almost shouting at the television, appalled at the lies, vicious half-truths and outright falsehoods told by people who not only _should_ have known better but undoubtedly _did_ know better. And it comes in rapid succession. Sandra Tanner, the kindly grandmotherly type interviewed in this video, actually owns an anti-Mormon bookstore in Salt Lake City and is known nationally as an outspoken critic of the church. And Wilder, a former 30-year member of the LDS church, is the author of a recent internet article entitled, ""How I Escaped the Mormon Temple.""

I've been LDS now for 45 years, coming from a former evangelical non-denominational Christian church. I put a high emphasis on honesty in my dealings and despise manipulation. We LDS believe what the apostle John promised when he said that as sons and daughters of God it ""does not yet appear what we shall be,"" but he promises that ""when we see God, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as he is."" (1 John 3:2) Yet Dr. Wilder says: ""Like Heavenly Father and Jesus before him -- like [Joseph] Smith himself -- [husband] Michael was working to become a god."" First, we LDS believe, as did the ancient saints, that man has the potential to become as God; however, to say her husband ""was working to become a god"" would be a gross misstatement and mischaracterization of what we believe. We can never ""work"" to become anything in the world to come. It's a gift based on our willingness to love and obey God with all of our hearts and to have faith in the power of salvation rendered by Jesus Christ. He is our Savior and our Judge. To take holy things and make them crass, or ridiculous, is one of hallmarks of our critics.

If you want to be misinformed, rent this video. It's carefully contrived to mislead.

Establishment of Inconsistent and Questionable Historical Context: B- There is much more to the story.

There is only one true religion: Don't be a jerk. The ""Christians"", with all of their red-faced eye rolling and holier-than-thou assessments, come off as desperate and inauthentic.

Both Christianity and Mormonism are garbage. The one thing Mormonism has going for it is personal responsibility (So it weeds out more jerks). ""Christians"": Laying all of your crappy behavior on the shoulders of a fictitious ""historical"" character is no more inane than a 14 year old boy dragging around 200 lbs of magic gold or divining scripture from the bottom of a hat.",1460246400,2,954,5.096153846153846
2811322,1,B000P5FH4Y,"As another less than active member said in his review, this could have been a great documentary, they did a good job with the history of the church, then they just dropped the ball on the church's doctrine, so hard it exploded and the shrapnel contaminated anything good, ruining the documentary and creating a Mockumentary.

I wish it had been done right, the producers had the information and the tools, they just blew it. They were too busy trying to make sure everyone knew ""Mormons aren't Christians"" they couldn't be bothered to do basic fact checking. Because I have been a member for 12 years, have an open mind, and have done some actual research, I can pick the truth from the crap. The rest of the viewing audience, unless Mormon history and doctrine are a hobby of theirs, won't know.  Most Mormons will shut down as soon as they see the first glaringly stupid error. I'm SURE no one lost their testimony over this poorly done ""show"".

I'm tempted to watch it again with a notebook, and catch all of the things they got right and wrong, but I don't have that much time, nor am I a masochist. What this ""show"" got wrong, they got REALLY wrong!! For instance, it is stated that Mormons believe Christ's Atonement happened ENTIRELY in the Garden of Gethsemane, which is wrong. Mormons believe Gethsemane is a BIG PART of Christ's Atonement, that he felt the weight of the world's sins and suffered so that blood came from his pores. This suffering and Atonement continues all the way through his death on the Cross. This a a CORE part of Mormon Doctrine, and they got it WRONG. I'm not even going to try and deconstruct what they said about Mormons and crosses. Just know they got it WRONG.

Speaking of sins...the BIGGEST sin was going on and on about how ""Mormon's aren't Christians, na, na, na, na, na ,na! Mormons have it all wrong, while the ubiquitous ""we"" (whoever THEY are) have it right.  THEY, of course, are Christians.  It sounds like little kids making fun of each other on the play ground, while not playing fair.  We really have no idea WHAT their doctrines are, or even WHICH brand of Christian they are. They give us a few carefully placed ""well, we have la te da correct"" but what else do they believe?  They could be eating babies on Sundays for all we know about them.

The deceptive way the producers of this...show wove factual statements in with plain crap, really bothered me. It's like they were trying to hide their proselytizing in between some facts, both right and wrong.  Anyone who knows Anything about the day Joseph Smith was killed, should know who died where and when.  Hyrum was shot through the door, and died on the floor BEFORE Joseph tried climb out the window.  Joseph also never finished the Masonic cry for help.  He only uttered a few words before dying.  I know Sandra would have caught this one.

This isn't the best review I've written.  Believing Mormons will write me off because I'm an inactive Mormon, Non-Mormons  will write me off just because I'm any kind of Mormon. It's a bad show, no matter who I am.  Joseph Smith did have 34 wives, and his first wife, Emma didn't like it.  He did order the printing press to be destroyed, and he was a ""glass looker"" from a large impoverished family, trying to feed his family. None of those factual statements make any of the doctrines and facts the producers got WRONG any more right.  What Mormons believe about Christ's Atonement, and the facts of what Mormons call the Martrydom, are SO BASIC, that getting them wrong really makes it hard to take anything else said in this Mockumentary seriously. Like I said earlier, NO ONE lost their testimony over this bad show.",1460160000,14,3673,4.587155963302752

I applaud the movie for giving an accurate representation of Mormon history. It gives the correct reasoning why each event happened in its history and adds the ""why"" of certain events in church history. An example of these are that the Mormon Expositor destruction of the printing press was the reason why Joseph Smith and Hyrum were thrown in Carthage jail. They added a ton of factual ""why's"" that the LDS church has glossed over and it should be information that all LDS members hear. The history of the Smiths is also very accurate and not many members get into their treasure seeking ways before Joseph's vision. The against the grain presentation of this was refreshing and insightful. The different events also covered during the Utah history was also very well done. The history of this video seems to be well researched and well done.
My big problem of the video is that the doctrine of the church was stated by non-Mormons who either used half-truths or full lies when stating the doctrines of the church. They also discuss that Mormon's are not Christians then state Mormon's beliefs and then do not contrast them towards Christian beliefs. They then state several ""Mormon"" beliefs that are not only stated within the LDS church but also stated within the Bible itself(Many of them come from the Book of Revelation). They then get the most fundamental core teaching of the LDS church The Atonement absolutely wrong. When they say that it ""only happened in the garden of gethsemane"" and not on the cross or resurrection. They also state ""blood atonement"" as official church doctrine(when it is not). I am very disappointed in how they did this and it ruined what could have been a pretty decent documentary.
The fact is when you want to know the history of a church look to non-members. When you want to know what they believe look to members. If they did this it would have been a much better documentary.",1459555200,4,2113,4.69811320754717

2811416,1,B000P5FH4Y,"This was listed on Amazon Prime as a Comedy.  It was not funny in any way. Neither was it a documentary.  It focuses on the opinions based on  blatantly false and unfounded information published by mormon haters 100+ years ago. There are few people interviewed that are not mormon haters.  It does not provide complete information on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons).

I have been educated on most of the issues raised in this film. None are hidden and are taught in religion classes offered in the Institute program (without the mormon haters slant).  I found it to be a 20-80 propaganda film with 20% facts and 80% highly biased hateful opinion.

When one woman intimated that Joseph Smith was the same as convicted child molester and cult leader Warren Jeffs I knew there was too much purposeful mormon haters bias.  I am concerned that such a hateful film is being promoted by Amazon.com.  Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, or even Muslims don't make such effort to discredit other religions like this.  Film should be renamed Meet The Mormon Haters.",1457481600,2,1079,4.8469945355191255

That everything that these unapproved documentaries or TV specials were poison and full of lies.  I grew away from the Mormon/LDS church for many reasons.  This is the first unapproved documentary about the church that I have ever seen.  It really showed me a side of the church that has been hidden from me.  I think it really shows the ""true"" church.  As a member you don't aways see the lies because your taught to avoid anything that could contradict the church's teachings.

The truths about the founding fathers and death of Joseph Smith are astonishing. The clash of the teachings with the Bible are irreconcilable or explainable by differences in translation. Those pointing these out are former members of the church of LDS. Thought-provoking stuff.

Had not read the negative reviews prior to writing mine. Will say this about them, it is intended for Christians. There is no doubt about that...but what it also does is reveal the problems in the LDS church and the secrets that are not revealed to the public. The two most shocking:
Women can only get into the highest heaven if a man calls them into it...and that man is proven worthy to be there.
You can never be sure you've done enough to get to the highest heaven.

I did see this as a negative view on any religion due to popularity of being negative towards any organized religion.
We get to see on CNN, Fox and many other mainstream news outlets that criminalize or at least make Muslims a bad religion due to radical ideas.

If your going to do a tell all from 5 individuals please give both sides of the story for it to be believable.

I say this because although the film is critical of Mormon theology, it allows viewers to think critically.  If your faith is unwavering, you gain a greater testimony by investigating these claims and finding ways that they may be wrong.
It is my opinion that if you investigate the claims made by this movie, you not only can investigate them for yourself but also help others who might struggle with the same concerns of faith in the church.",1456531200,,523,4.736263736263736

They continue by condeming as ""ridiculous"" many beliefs and rituals of the LDS church, only to end with everyone  converting to ""Christianity"";  somehow their new found non-disclosed denomination of Christian faith is clearly so much more sane? All this "" documentary "" did was point out how gullible the people being interviewed were. All we have here are a bunch of Christians changing from one sect to another, trying to tell you why their former faith makes no sense,  but their new one is clearly totally logical. As a former missionary myself, I personally came to believe that I was delusional believing in any religion. It's hard to understand how these people can be so anti-Morman, but once again blindly believe in some alternate faith with an equally contradictory doctrine. If you want to watch something that reinforces your belief that your Christian faith makes you superior (assuming you aren't a Christian who also happens to be Morman) than watch on.

Many of them appear to be people who, for one reason or another, became disenchanted with the Church or even turned against it.  Why would you expect to learn anything about the actual beliefs of this faith when you are constantly barraged with words like 'they claim to' or 'supposedly'?  This isn't a documentary about what the Mormons believe.  It's a documentary about what people who dislike the Mormon faith believe.  If you really want to learn what the Mormons (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) believe - ask a Mormon who actually follows their faith.  I extend the same invitation for any faith.

Before the internet, all good Mormons had very little to base their faith on---other than listening to the General Authorities.  Now, the internet it full of information.

2811590,3,B000P5FH4Y,"Calvinism as the answer? While I applaud the debunking of the Mormon blasphemy cult, I can say in all honesty that the film ends by condemning Arminianism, Roman Catholicism, and Patristic Eastern Orthodoxy (the Faith of the Holy Apostles) by defining Christianity as a distilled Calvinism. I won't go into the flaws of Calvinism, and admittedly it is a Christian heretical system. However, it is laudatory that the polytheism and luciferian Cosmo! ogy of Mormonism is underscored here. The point presented here is that of Blessed Augustine versus the Manichaens. Mormons are indeed gnostics and in many ways contemporary Manichaens. But the enemy here is not Pelagius, but, rather, false teaching, works without faith, and luciferian dualism. Islam has a similar system of salvation without luciferian dualism, a similar understanding of CHRIST as Messiah without polytheism, a similar understanding of Haj or Temple without vicarious baptisms and atonements. I write that because I am underscoring that Islam is a more Christian Faith system than Mormonism, and that Mormonism seems to be a lot like a cross between Mandaenism and Freemasonry. CHRIST for Mormons is a prop for control, power, manipulation and totalitarian sectarianism. It is a cult.

That being said, I will toss the ball back at the neo Calvinists here and say that once saved always saved is predicated on heretical notions of predestination and election coupled with hateful ideas of rasa damnata. I refer them to the Epistle of St. James and the Holy Gospel of St. Matthew to read the contents of the Sermon on the Mount carefully. Then I hope our Calvinist friends finally understand that St. Paul rails against the inefficacy of the works of the Law of Moses while a cursory read of the Book of Acts will show that St. Paul not only participated in the works of the Church but witnessed their necessity to the faithful in CHRIST.

Mormon godhood is a luciferian blasphemy. In CHRIST JESUS we are justified in grace and reconciled with GOD the FATHER by the HOLY SPIRIT becoming partakers of Divine Nature by rebirth in CHRIST JESUS in HIS BODY, the Church, partaking of HIS Holy BODY and BLOOD in the Holy Eucharist unto sanctification and remission of sins and life everlasting, becoming ""gods by grace"" by the indwelling of CHRIST by HIS Holy BODY and BLOOD by the HOLY SPIRIT.",1453852800,,2355,4.974619289340102

Church and have known a few Mormans whom I respect and trust.  This film reveals the primary difference is that their
Church teaches that salvation is based upon good works whereas Christianity teaches that salvation is through your belief and acceptance of Jesus Christ as your savior.",1453852800,,479,5.102564102564102

2811596,1,B000P5FH4Y,"As a non-LDS east-coaster moving to Salt Lake City, I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about the people who, in large part, built this city.  While I was educated on some very general information regarding the Mormons, I was disappointed to find that it was extremely biased in its point of view, interviewing only ex-Mormons who had lost their faith in the religion (and blatantly advertise their new faith in Jesus as Christians who have finally seen the light), rather than practicing Mormons as well.

It makes me sick that this is advertised and labeled and even accredited to be a legitimate documentary about this faith and the people who practice it when, in truth, it is constantly undermined by the reminder that Christianity is the one true faith and that there is only one path to take.  I came here with an open mind.  About halfway through the film, I realized that this account is not open-minded.  It is so one-sided and ignorant that it cannot be considered legitimate.

Religion is undefinable and there are so many versions of it.  If they were going to take this approach with this documentary, the least they could have done would be interviewing people who have taken different paths, but they are ALL new-found Christians who can't believe how fortunate they are to be where they are today.  I didn't watch it for that.  I watched it to learn where they were and who they were and what LDS is all about, but I have had better luck doing that through conversation with the wonderful people I have met in this city.  I believe that all religions are valid and that is part of what makes me proud to be in this country.  This is such a touchy and weird topic to base an Amazon review on, but I had to state my opinion because I am deeply disappointed in what this film conveys.  It is offensive.  If this is your only education on this faith, it would be hard to believe that there are people who are actually happy to be LDS, but there absolutely are and they've been excluded from this film which claims to be about them.",1453766400,13,2050,4.508108108108108

2811658,4,B000P5FH4Y,"I have Amazon on Roku and watched this morning. I gave it a four because it does give factual history on the conception of the religion though it is abbreviated. I have commented to many posters here and there is just too many that think that it is all lies because these people fell out of faith with the Mormon religion and found faith in another and somehow that makes anything they say dishonest and false.
I used to be a Mormon myself years ago and it was the condescending way I was treated by a leading member that lead me to do research on the religion myself. After 25+ years I have found out much of the history through State and Federal documents, diaries, writings, history of the States and talking. It's all out there and no matter how much the LDS Church tries to cover it up the facts are authentic. I would like to address some of what was presented in the film. With respect to Amazon since this could end up being very lengthy I'm only giving one source, one which the Mormon Church has tried to discredit for many years but has been unable to do so.
1. March 20, 1826 Joseph Smith was put on trial for disorderly conduct in Bainbridge New York. In the witness statements they all tell how he used a stone to 'see' where treasure and other things could be found.
http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no68.htm
2. There were multiple versions of the vision that J. Smith recounted showing him where to find the golden plates for him to translate.
http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no100.htm
3. Strangely enough we find inserted in the middle of the Book of Mormon, pages 141-143 [BOM p. 143-45, 1981 ed.] a little book entitled the ""Book of Mormon,"" or ""Words of Mormon."" It is by the supposed author or compiler of the entire work, the prophet Mormon. He has a book of his own, in its proper place, near the close of the work, recording his own life, and his connection with Nephite history. And this little affair of only two pages, having nothing whatever to do with the thread of the history that is being recorded, is to an ordinary reader of the Book of Mormon, wholly inexplicable. It becomes, intelligible, however, when read in connection with a certain untoward event that occurred in connection with the translation of the book by Joseph Smith. This event, as related by Mr. Smith's friends, is something like this:  The missing 116 pages Mr. Martin Harris, who was employed as Mr. Smith's scribe at the beginning of the translation, had written out with his own hand 116 pages of manuscript. By long and persistent coaxing, and the most faithful promises of secrecy, he secured Mr. Smith's permission to carry said manuscript to his own house for his wife's inspectiona woman who is accredited with a very irascible temper. Before the precious treasure was returned to its owner, a sad domestic quarrel so thoroughly provoked Mrs. Harris, that in an evil hour she put said manuscript forever out of the way. The general belief was that she burned it. But the prophet Joseph evidently was afraid she had not, but had secretly hid it, for the purpose of entrapping him, should he ever attempt to reproduce the pages. If the work was really of God, the manuscript could be reproduced word for word without a mistake. If, however, Joseph inspired it himself, his memory would hardly be adequate to such a task, without numberless changes or verbal differencesand thus ""give himself away,"" since he loudly professed to be all the time aided ""by the gift and power of God.""
This has many more parts to it and can be found here:
http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bom_early_problems/goldenbible_stolenmanuscript.htm
4. Blood Atonement. "" I could refer you to plenty of instances where men, have been righteously slain, in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance (in the last resurrection there will be) if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to the devil, until our elder brother Jesus Christ raises them upconquers death, hell, and the grave. I have known a great many men who have left this Church for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltation, but if their blood had been spilled, it would have been better for them. The wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this principle's being in full force, but the time will come when the law of God will be in full force.
This is loving our neighbour as ourselves; if he needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it. Any of you who understand the principles of eternity, if you have sinned a sin requiring the shedding of blood, except the sin unto death, would not be satisfied nor rest until your blood should be spilled, that you might gain that salvation you desire. That is the way to love mankind.""
A Discourse by President Brigham Young, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, February 8, 1857.

2811660,1,B000P5FH4Y,"I'll be up front - I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. A large group of the other reviewers here would automatically discount my review. They would automatically state I am either lying or brain washed. Well, I am neither. I have reviewed many books and movies, and one of the biggest drawbacks of this is that it is presented as a documentary. It is not. It is a hit piece. It's a shame that Amazon would post it with serious movies. Look at the producer - Vision Video. They are specifically a religious video producer. This is no more than a proselyting video for them. Look up the company and see for yourself.
  There is a lot of reasonable information that is accurate and factual, particularly in the beginning. The problem is that after a short while of portraying a pretty reasonable representation, the barbs start coming out. Some are just portrayed negatively and misrepresentations, but there are some out and out falsehoods. Nowhere is there any attempt to understand or do more than make accusations.
  As one reviewer said it - if you don't like Mormonism or Mormons, you'll love this. It plays into your fears and misconceptions and feeds prejudice.

Based on my personal accounts with Mormons, they always give the idea that they promote Jesus Christ.  However once you take them through the Scriptures, it is undeniable that the Jesus they teach is not the Jesus of the Bible.  If the Bible was corrupted as Mormons will tell you, then why can they not prove that claim and shed light of the corruption?  They can't, because the Bible is one of the most criticized texts there is; however, it has stood the test of time and will continue to do so.

This documentary is pure propaganda. Any ""legitimate"" documentary film would fully explore a topic and therefore the makers here should have been intelligent enough to include multiple, historical factual data and related views. After all this is titled: ""Mormons"" (actually ""The MORMONS"").
Okay, here's a family that wasted 35 years and feels sorry for themselves, hmmm and 3 other EX-MORMONS that also feel sorry for themselves and instead of moving on, want to fool people into watching a video that is UNETHICALLY TITLED.  I like to learn the good and bad of a topic and I expected an honest video - WHEN IT""S LISTED AS A DOCUMENTARY!
These people are sad EX-MORMONS that take themselves far too seriously and have a clear self importance that is distasteful - but was humorously entertaining at times.  It's shameful that ALL involved think they are the EXPERTS in Mormonism, since those that failed at it and are bitter, and the ""Professors"" too - but I think they are still just after Mary-Ann with Gilligan's Island - that was the extent of their religious training!
I love to study all religion and especially Christianity.  I enjoy INTELLIGENT and ETHICALLY produced documentaries on religion from world archeological sites, to the Vatican, to Israel and religious history all so much and this video is nothing of that caliber.  These half dozen EX-MORMONS and ANTI-MORMONS did not come close to approaching this project in an ethical way - shame on them for that.  Now they are trying to make a profit by becoming their own PROPHETS.  What a bunch of mentally imbalanced infants.  The Mormon church is NOT perfect, but as I see it - where men are - imperfection will always be as well.  Islam, Judaism, and clearly the Vatican with it's dark and troubled problems all have much more sinister things to deal with, but God so loved the world, that he gave his only son - for us ALL.  For those that believe - great - for those that do NOT - great.  We ALL have a choice.  As for me, I just wish the ANTI- religion messages would be honestly marked as such so that I can continue to learn and explore the mysteries and the wonder of the world and humanity.

I am so excited to see a fairly well done documentary about the deceit of the LDS church.  I had always struggled with members of the church telling me to ""stay clear"" of anti-LDS material... but if the LDS church is the one true church on the face of the earth, why couldn't it answer these questions?

I encourage others to share this with friends to begin a dialogue and begin to ask the Lord to reveal where the darkness and lies are in what is still taught and hidden by the mormon church and its leaders.
To be clear, I am still overwhelmed by the love and care I experienced by every LDS member I was friends with or was taught by.  I think that's why this documentary is so good as it explains many of the lies in a simple and honest way to trust to go explore/research for yourself (and Jesus will manifest everything needed to see the truth and for the ""scales to fall off your eyes"").  This is a serious improvement from the weak documentation as shown in ""God Makers"" back in the 80's (which focused most of it's efforts on examples of splinter LDS groups or the more extreme teachings of the LDS church; which, although they were all true, were hard to believe for a young/recent believing mormon who hadn't been exposed to them yet; they seemed too ""out there"" to possibly be true).

Rather than telling a balanced documentary that actually told the way members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints responded throughout to the same topics that the group of ex-Mormons covered. They were all informed individuals, who had done some reading up on the historical events that were discussed. But what sources did their information come from? They are discrediting Joseph Smith and his explanations of how some things happened. Other than their disbelief, what evidence do they have that shows the version they are stating is the actual truth is in fact the way it happened. Isn't it just coming down to a matter of they are saying this, and Joseph Smith said that. For example when they were talking about the translated pages that Martin Harris had and wanted to have translated. This documentary referred to statements that say Harris' wife may have taken the pages and burned them. I had understood that Joseph recorded that the pages were lost. Without any specific mention of what had actually happened to them. The reason for not regenerating the original pages was to prevent having some one publish an altered version and claim that either the original was not correct, or that Joseph had left parts out or changed it to read the way he wanted it to. My point here is that because the show only gave the opinions of the non-Mormons, we were not given a full or complete picture of the issues being discussed. Also having ex-Mormons speak for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is hardly a reliable way to have accurate information on what the LDS doctrines are or what their actual beliefs are. This group argued that man is saved through Jesus Christ by Grace alone, but there are many Christian denominations here in the USA and world wide which believe that faith without works is dead. In other words God does expect us to do what we are able to do, and their Then he he will take it from there. They also talked about unforgivable sins, and blood attainment, something else that they really should be far better educated about before they try to explain it to the public at large.

It's a a deceptive and cynical attempt to maximize the effects of proselytization efforts.  While claiming that traditional Christianity is a false religion and LDS is the only true faith, hijack Christian terminology (with disguised but different meanings) to glom onto and profit from whatever mixed credibility Christianity has accumulated over the centuries.

I highly recommend this documentary to non latter day saints converts and people right about to convert. I was an agnostic for most of my adult life even though I felt god. I decided to become a born again protestant. I studied the church three years ago and went to services with the elders i kid u not I felt like i was home.  I felt so welcomed and loved. Something I never felt before. Im 31 now swallowed my pride and finally accepted Christ into my heart. Right after I felt the holy spirit leading me back to the church. I attended a non denomination church and I didn't get that feeling of pure love as I did in the lds church. I respect everyones opinion and beliefs but in no way is this church a cult or preach we can become gods on other planets.  Scientology the peoples temple etc...are and were cults. This church saved my life and the love I get from the ward and just fellow lds is so beautiful almost magical and I only feel it with the church. The church made me a better person and a reason to get up in the morning with my heart knowing im part of a worldly family. I love this church more then anything and I advise one does there own research go to service.  Talk to the elders.

2811744,5,B000P5FH4Y,"In two parts, Part I details the first century of the Mormon Church. In the early 19th century, a very young American named Joseph Smith claimed he saw the vision of an angel of God who told him about some gold plates that contained bible-like stories about Jews who came to the Americas long before Columbus. Smith went on to transcribe the writing on the plates, or so the story has been told, which came to be known as the Book of Mormon. Smith founded a new religion based on these texts, the Mormons or Church of Latter-Day Saints (aka Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints). However, because of his proximity to modern times, Joseph Smith is not viewed in the same way as Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed by people outside of Mormon traditions. Smith lacks the legendary aura of other more ancient figures which is at the heart of the Mormon challenge to legitimize their religion in the eyes of others and other religious faiths. Ironically, Christians of the first century dealt with similar issues and were labeled as being superstitious by Roman authorities, such as Pliny the Younger.

Unlike historians of Judaism and Christianity who must find evidence among archaeological sites thousands of years old, the Mormons' history is well-documented, and not quite 200 years old. This history is the center-piece of the first part of a new documentary by PBS which begins with the revelations by Joseph Smith in Pennsylvania, continues with the first fledgling congregations in rural upstate New York to their flights from persecution. Mormons left the state of NY and settled in Missouri only to be ousted again by other locals and forced to migrate to Utah. The documentary ends with the construction of the large temple in Salt Lake City and its quest to denounce certain practices of its forefathers, the most controversial being polygamy.

This first part of the documentary features commentary by both Mormons and non-Mormons. Discussion of the Mormon church's official accounting is tempered with accounting by historians who are not members of the faith. The picture painted by the documentary is one of great ambiguity. On one hand, the faith encourages family, fellowship and responsibility. On the other hand, the faith seems not only embarrassed by its own history, but resolved to rewrite historical fact. Very clear documentary evidence exists to substantiate that Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and many of their earliest followers practiced polygamy. However, the church has tried to distance itself not only from the polygamist practices of its earliest members but attempted to write some of the episodes out of its history, as part of a public relations campaign. And yet they still propagate Joseph Smith as being a prophet.

The Mormons are secretive about certain aspects of their faith. Non-Mormons are not allowed inside their temples. Certain practices, ceremonies, disciplinary procedures, and transcripts are kept hidden from non-Mormon scrutiny. Church leaders are often immune from criticism and yet have the power to punish and even excommunicate members who vocalize dissent from decisions made by the leadership. Even the Catholic Church allows for greater dissent among its members than Mormons. This may be part of the ambivalent view that people of other faiths including other Christian sects, have of the Mormons. If the Church of Latter-Day Saints wishes to proclaim that their church is completely legitimate, then Mormons should not be afraid to reveal everything about their religion to outsiders, including historical documents, practices, and even judicial trials. Unless, of course, they have something to hide. No religion is free from indiscretions, and those that claim legitimacy must embrace their skeletons in the closet.

The beginning of Part II reveals a church struggling for legitimacy while simultaneously holding on to its distinctiveness in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a challenge that all churches, both east and west, often face. Its first task was to forbid the practice of polygamy, which had stigmatized much of the reputation of the church during the 19th century. The prominent figure from the era is Reed Smoot, first senator elected from Utah and the first Mormon to hold a United States national office. The documentary briefly relates his four-year struggle to be seated in the US Congress against opposition. One hundred years later, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs at US Presidential inaugurations. The Mormons had arrived. During most of its 150+ history, the church had prejudices against non-white followers until 1978 in which the Church allowed aspiring Mormons of any color or creed to join as full members. The documentary also praises the LDS Church's humanitarian aid, particularly in the face of Katrina. One New Orleans resident describes his shift in perception of Mormons post-Katrina, and that he will always welcome them into his house. And an interesting chapter on missionary work describes the commitment of young missioners, typically 19-year-olds, who dedicate two years of their life to propagate the Mormon message around the world.

At the same time, Church Elders, who are older white males, and their decisions are largely immune from scrutiny by lesser-ranking members with the threat of excommunication hanging over them. In other words, decisions by church elders are not to be questioned by church members, in particular women, with the rationale that such questioning could lead to doubt and undermine the church's goals. And the Church may condemn and excommunicate those who question and/or reveal information contrary to the official doctrine, history, and teachings of the LDS Church.
One such woman, Margaret Toscano, who had written articles questioning the church's position that women could not hold higher offices in the church legislator, recounts her experience of being summoned in front of a church tribunal. Her story recalls the kinds of tribunals in centuries past where the accused sat alone, without representation or defense, in front of a panel of judges who would decide his or her fate. The judges in Mormon disciplinary tribunals apparently serve also as jury, determining the religious fate of the accused. Although Toscano has spoken publicly about her experience, Mormon trial transcripts are kept from public scrutiny. Terryl Givens, a Mormon scholar, felt that he could not give an opinion about Toscano's case. Why? Because only half of the Toscano story (Toscano's interview) was revealed without the transcripts and interviews of the judges. The other side of the story will probably never be disclosed. A rather strange irony...

Overall, an excellent portrayal of a religious sect that continues to not only be redefined and re-characterized by historians but redefined by itself. Mormons who are content with their religion, follow the precepts as dictated by the elders, dedicate their lives to helping others, and propagate the faith of the LDS Church need have no fear from church authority. But those who cross lines set by church governance may have their religious lives revoked. The only thing I can say is that I judge a religious group not by how they treat those who behave within proscribed limits, but how they treat those they judge as apostates.",1430956800,,7324,5.218351741716227

I am not a Christian and although there are many unusual aspects of Mormonism, there are many unusual beliefs of the hundreds of Christian denominations in the USA.
If you think Mormons have dangerous beliefs, I direct you to the DVD Zeitgeist: The Movie, which states that many Christian practices are based on Egyptian religions and that there is little evidence that Jesus existed. There are many wild beliefs out there. We should live our lives on truth based on science, not on beliefs. Give the Mormons a break.",1390435200,,688,4.733333333333333

2811750,1,B000P5FH4Y,"I'd hoped for a serious explanation of how Mormon family values have changed so much over the years. Joseph Smith had 27 or so wives. The DVD fails to offer ANY theological justification for a ""downsizing"" to today's monogamy that most Mormons practice in 2013. Apparently, cherished historical beliefs and customs can be changed by at will by Mormon clerics. For example, blacks being being unable to hold the LDS priesthood until 1978 because they were considered descendants of Cain (who murdered his brother) wasn't adequately explained in this DVD. Another serious deficiency of this DVD is that American Miracles, so dear to the hearts of practicing Mormons, are not discussed. For miracle enthusiasts it would seem that relatively new miracles invented in America should have greater credibility than those invented several centuries ago (such as Mohammed going upwards to the ""gates of heaven"" on a magical white horse - without benefit of normal air transport). Aren't newer miracles better than older ones? This issue is not adequately covered in this fascinating DVD. It would be really nice to know more about the magical golden slates, lost or misplaced somewhere in upstate New York. Also, I'm curious on how Mormon Magic Underwear works.

In 240 Minutes, it seems that above issues deserved coverage.
Alas. My hopes were dashed. There's much more to be learned.

A great effort was obviousily made by PBS to present a balanced, non-judgmental, view of LDS church history; but the bottom line is the LDS church is masquerading as a religious faith, when it actually is a thriving business, effectively practicing religious brainwashing.

I am a big PBS fan. However, this documentary was below the standard of excellence I expect from PBS. I'm not saying it's bad; it's just not as good as I hoped.

If you want to understand Mormons, then unfortunately this documentary will spend too much time telling you about the ""controversial"" aspects. This approach might be relevant to a journalism story, but not so much for a doc with the title ""The Mormons,"" which gives the impression it will be a general overview of what Mormons are about.

The doc spent too much time on ""eggheads"" intellectualizing the church and not enough time explaining what Mormons really believe and who your average Mormon is.

I have the impression that the filmmakers saw Mormonism as a rather strange thing and couldn't quite figure out how to approach the subject. Nevertheless, ""The Mormons"" is a very broad topic, and I commend them for doing a decent - if not great - job of tackling it.

If you are trying to understand Mormons, you should know that there is a lot of misinformation out there. Look at a variety of sources - some of the most popular books on the topic are the most distorted.

But what really stuck with me  was the almost constant, vaguely hypnotic  use of the opening of the Prokofiev Second Piano Concerto throughout, as theme music. I cannot figure out if the use of this great music had a deeper significance. The mournfulness of the score's opening  would seem to be a strange fit for this bold religion. But, then again, maybe the very elusiveness of the theme, suggesting a culture quite different from our own (in that case a Soviet one), signaled a corresponding feeling of difference that Mormons reportedly variably have experienced. My one regret is that Glenn Beck was not musically educated enough to recognize the music as a Soviet masterpiece. If he had we could have been regaled by a conspiracy theory on his program announcing a nefarious communist plot to overtake his faith with dangerous music from Prokofiev. If only Professor Robert George had taken time off from his banjo-playing, to inquire through his connections with Salt Lake City news outlets, to inquire about a music not involving loud twangs. Glenn Beck and Robert George could have come up with some cryptic meaning for this modernist masterpiece being used to symbolize the progress of the LDS Church. A flouting of Natural Law, perhaps. Surely, Prokofiev might have a meaning against the gold standard too, though his music alludes to steel more than the precious ore.

2811759,5,B000P5FH4Y,"The Mormons is a four-hour PBS documentary on the history and culture of the LDS Church.  The first two hours focus on the history of the church from its founding by Joseph Smith to the time that the church renounced polygamy so that Utah could gain statehood. The last two hours examine contemporary Mormon culture. My wife and I watched all four hours and we both recommend this film.

The Amazon.com reviews of this film seem to run the gamut. I do not think that The Mormons is a ""hatchet job"" on the LDS Church. I do think, however, that devout Mormons will be disappointed in the film, as the filmmakers heavily focus on the human failings of Mormon leaders Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. The film also details how the Mormons harshly deal with apostates and those who do not fit in the traditional Mormon mold (such as gays and lesbians).

I knew some of the basic outlines of the Mormon story prior to watching this film. I did learn some interesting things, however. I was surprised at how many of the Mormon converts later renounce the faith. I was also surprised to learn that, for Mormons, social life completely revolves around their church; in effect, a Mormon works a second full-time job as an LDS member. Finally, I was surprised to learn that the rate of conversion of non-Mormons has been falling in recent years.

2811760,4,B000P5FH4Y,"Helen Whitney does a superb job of presenting through interviews, a picture of the true Mormonism. So many things are generally not known among the membership, and many things are taboo. For instance, the Official account of the First Vision is as President Hinckley says is the cornerstone of the faith. Nobody will tell you about the other versions.
Another interesting tidbit is that even though he is a Professor of Islamic studies, Mr. Peterson is also one of the heads of F.A.R.M.S. and FAIRLDS (now the Neil A.Maxwell Institute) which are the premier apologist organizations for the church. He is the one who admits that the translation of the Book of Mormon is far different from the accepted and portrayed method.

The events in Mormon history such as the Mountain Meadows Massacre are often whitewashed and blamed on the emigrants and Indians. We know that that is not true, and it was good to see this event described in its true light. Many faithful members are told through out their lives that the things mentioned here were Anti-mormon lies. As a faithful Mormon, I was astonished by this video. More upsetting is that we were forbidden to discuss the show in church even though the material is true.

My hat is off to Helen and PBS. While the program was shocking and yet uplifting at the same time, it presents us with a clear picture of what Mormonism was and is. I recommend this video highly. The church places great demands on its membership, and expects unwavering loyalty. People should get a fuller picture before committing everything to the faith.

Faithful Mormons may be upset by this video.",1247529600,9,1619,4.795698924731183
2811761,3,B000P5FH4Y,"This four hour documentary goes into all of aspects of the Mormon story. However, for my purposes the first two hour segment was most important concerning the founding myths and trials and tribulations of the early Mormons as they kept getting banished further westward until they found a final central settlement in Utah. The second two hour segment concerning the assimilation of the more orthodox Mormons into the mainstream of political and social life and their successes at political power and their growth through missionary zeal are less important. We have been there before on this assimilation question for other ethnic and religious groups, notably the Roman Catholics of Irish, Italian and Eastern European heritage so that part was not of pressing concern to me.

I know the land that nurtured Mormon founder Joseph Smith, the farm country of upstate, mid-state New York. Places like Utica, Amsterdam, Rochester and so forth.  At least I know the late 20th century version of those places. The seemingly endless rolling hills, the hard scrabble rocky land where there is no give without some Herculean effort. The vast tracts of trees and other obstacles to farming to be uprooted and brought to manageable size. The hard, hard winters that start early and end late. Hell, and that is what it is like now so one can only imagine what it was like for those who in the early 19th early were essentially on the American frontier looking to see if or why their god had abandoned them. There were more seekers, peekers, ranters, panter, shakers and quakers than you could shake a stick at this side of the 17th century English revolution. Put that together with a charismatic, rather mystical and intelligent young man, Joseph Smith, and you certainly have the genesis for some kind of religious movement. Or a political one for that matter. In a latter age that might very well have been the case. Whether, and if, such a plebian movement based on ""revealed"" truth could survive among the others more secular trends in the labor movement is the real question.

The documentary goes into some detail about Smith's ability to gain converts (and spin off dissenters) after his conversion experience. It moves on to discuss the creation of the first Mormon communities in upstate New York, the pressure of other Christian denominations to push them out, the success of that effort and the first evacuation of Mormons to Missouri. After some hotly disputed fights from there to Illinois where Smith was assassination by other non-Mormon Christians. Then on to the Brigham Young led treks to the West, the establishment of thriving settlements there, the famous, if shadowy Mountain Meadow massacre by the Mormons on other settlers that, in effect, consolidated Mormon political power in the Utah territories; the fight over polygamy and the eventual entrance into statehood and the assimilation process mentioned above.

I first began looking for Mormon material over a year ago. I started and put down more than one biography about Joseph Smith or Brigham Young. Or histories of the early days (especially that controversial Mountain Meadow incident). The problem is that most of this material is by Mormons or Mormon-influenced authors and I felt I had to discount most of it, especially the ""myth of creation"" aspects around what Joseph Smith did or did not find out in those lonesome hills of up state New York. This documentary, more so than other PBS documentaries in this ""American Experience"" series suffer some of that same problem. There are too many ""talking heads"" identified as historians without being designated as Mormon historians. This is not generally a problem in other PBS productions. Still, if you need a well-produced introduction to this esoteric religion this is a good place to start. And perhaps to finish.",1237680000,5,3838,5.029874213836478
2811762,5,B000P5FH4Y,"As a non-Mormon living in Mormon Country (Utah, USA) I was anxious to see this PBS program when it first aired last year.  I have been married to a Mormon lady for the past 37 years and during that time I have had much contact with the church and have learned much about the faith and its people, although for personal reasons I have decided the faith is not for me.  This documentary holds true to what I have learned about this most unique of American religious denominations.  It is a fair-minded HISTORY of the Mormon Church and its wonderful people.  It does not, however, delve into church doctrine or dogma.  If you are interested in learning only about doctrine, this documentary is not for you.  It would behoove you to contact your local LDS missionaries or the Church in Salt Lake City itself.  They will be more than happy to cater to your curiosities, I'm sure.

One of the most insightful moments in the documentary is when the narration proposes an explanation as to why the Mormons are so centered upon the temple rites of sealing your spouse and your children to yourself for ""all time and eternity"".  To paraphrase, ""The church was organized in America during a time of great westward migration and family separation.  It was a period in our history when children would leave home to seek their fortunes and never be heard from by their families again.  The temple endowments were aimed at keeping the family together, if not in this life, then in the next 'for all time and eternity.'""  This goes a long way in explaining why the Mormons think the way they do, and why the Church is organized the way it is.

I heartily recommend this documentary for anyone who is interested in American History and the history of the the Mormon people.  It is one of the best, if not THE best, films on the Mormons I have had the pleasure to watch and own.",1228003200,19,1860,4.513432835820896

The documentary the Mormons was very well produced and in particular I found that the abscence of identification vis a vis religious persuasion of participants assisted in the overall homogenity of the production.

I would have valued one section that was critical of the content of the written revelation and in particular the controversies over the Spaulding manuscript thesis and the controversies regarding the Book of Abraham etc.  However, it was an absorbing contribution to the study of new religious movements without being too technical.

I would recommend this documentary to any persons who have an interest in this field or who are researching the The Mormon faith.

2811766,4,B000P5FH4Y,"PBS in conjunction with Paramount Home Entertainment just released a DVD called ""The Mormons."" It contains two parts of fairly extensive coverage of the history of the Mormons from Joseph Smith to their persecution to their settlement in Utah. Then Part II goes more into the daily life of the Mormon community, including controversial issues such as their stand on social moral issues such as the ERA, marriages between homosexual partners, etc...

I thought the documentaries were quite in depth and they showed a lot of different perspectives of various people on this particular sect.

From a personal standpoint, I was very interested in this DVD, because I've had quite a bit of interactions with Mormons or Latter Day Saints as they are also called. They are truly some of the nicest people you can meet. They claim to be a Christian sect, since the name of their church is really ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."" But just like you can't really judge a book by its cover, you can't really judge a church by its name. You really have to look at what their Statement of Faith and their application to that is.

The fact is that their beliefs are not Christian at all. To start off with, when you ask a Mormon, if they believe that there are more than one God in the entire universe, they will say ""Yes."" They believe there is only one God for this world though. They claim it is the God of this world. (Interestingly that phrase is used in the Bible as a reference to Satan, see II Cor. 4:4). As a matter of fact, Mormons also believe that they themselves will become a god, ruling with their family over some planet. Believing in more than one god is a polytheistic belief, thus not Christian, because Christianity is a monotheistic belief system.

They believe that Joseph Smith was shown the golden tablets by the angel Moroni. He then translates them into the Book of Mormon with the help of the ""Urim and Thummin."" This becomes part of the written revelation of God, so they say. That's quite a statement, especially since there isn't a whole lot of proof for that. If you study the Bible, you'll see that every time major revelations are given, they are always accompanied by signs or miracles to authenticate the revelation. For instance around the time the New Testament was written, both Christ and the apostles did many miracles, such as Christ rising from the dead. Over 500 people witnessed Christ alive. In the Old Testament, we also have the same thing. The Old Testament can be seen as the Law and the Prophets. As a matter of fact, Christ referred to the Old Testament as such. When the law was given, many miracles accompanied them, when the prophets appeared, such as Elijah and Elisha, many miracles accompanied them too. Those are also the times when major revelation was given. Interestingly, all three of those events are separated by about 700 years each. Hence the reference in Heb. 1:1,2 and 2:3,4 ""God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world....After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard, God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.""

Of course one could argue that the angel Moroni was the authentication. I would be very careful with that though, especially since there is such clear warning in the Bible of receiving revelation from angels that is contrary to the written Revelation of God's Word, the Bible. See Gal. 1:8: ""But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!"" After all, Satan and his demons are nothing more than fallen angels.

The main concern, I have with the Mormon faith though is what they believe one has to do to enter heaven after they die. Their requirements are: 1. Belief in Christ, 2. Public Confession, 3. Water Baptism, 4. Laying on of Hands, and 5, Obedience to the Ordinances of the Church. That's not what the Bible says at all.

The Bible teaches that all of us are sinners, (Rom. 3:23) and that if we were to pay or be punished for our sins, we would have to spend eternity separated from God in a place called hell. (Rom. 6:23). To go to heaven however, one has to be perfect, (Rev. 21:27) hence no one is good enough to go to heaven or could be saved by their own good works. (Eph. 2:8,9)

God saw this situation and being righteous and just, our sins had to punished or paid for. So, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ to die on the cross for us, (II Cor. 5:21, I Peter 2:24). After Christ died on the cross, He rose from the dead, proving once and for all that He did pay for sins and that He was the Savior. All He asks us to do to receive that payment for our sins is to simply trust in what He did for us and all of our sins will be forgiven. (John 3:16, John 6:47).

John 3:16 says: ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, should not perish but have eternal life.""

This is not what the Mormons teach and as such they are leading people astray.",1185667200,14,5296,4.439300411522634
2811767,3,B000P5FH4Y,"As a believing member of the Mormon church, I found this to be a decent enough introduction to the history of the Mormon church.  Of course there will always be disagreements about how balanced any documentary is; this one did an OK job.  There were a couple of problems, however.  First, the documentary spends very little time with current, believing members of the church.  Not that their views aren't represented, but they could have spent a little less time with Mormon ""academics"" and more time with the lay members that do most of the work and believing in the church.  Second, the documentary strays in the second half (at least the second night shown on TV) with what can only be described as a disproportionate fixation with dancing.  While the fact that dancing is not banned may set us apart from other ""strict"" faiths, it is hardly an essential or even meaningful part of our religion.  BYU (a church owned private university) does have excellent dance teams, but they were shown in the documentary as if they were a representation of normal LDS church members.  Rather, they are trained teams and students in classes, like many colleges all over the nation.  The average LDS member doesn't dance any more than non LDS church members.  Another issue I had with it dealt with a family in Colorado with a daughter that was diagnosed with a terminal disease (cancer I believe).  While anyone will feel compassion for the family, I couldn't figure out why the story took so long to tell and why focus on them.  It did show how Mormon strive to focus on the family (which is true), but I felt there were other stories and examples just as worthy and perhaps more relevant that could have been explored.

I feel like the historical part of the documentary did a fairly good job of explaining Mormon history, the area of the documentary focused on what it is like being Mormon today failed to really capture the normal modern LDS life.

In the end, this won't convert anyone, though it shouldn't keep those interested in converting from further investigation either.  Rather, it is what it is--an outsider's view of a unique and challenging religion.  You can hardly criticize the Mormon church for lacking empirical evidence to prove its truthfulness as no religion can back up their claims in this manner (as faith would simply not exist).  Otherwise, we would all be following that religion.  Rather, the Mormons are a faith that still believes in miracles and that God talks to man today as he did in the past.

2811768,5,B000P5FH4Y,"Despite the protests of some on either extreme (ultra-orthodox or anti-mormon) ""The Mormons"" was a balanced treatment of the LDS religion, history and dcotrine. Pro-Mormons might think it focused too much on uncomfortable history-- Anti-Mormons will think it didn't focus on those items enough. The fact that neither is fully satisfied speaks to how well the director covered the material.

It must be remembered that this is not a LDS proselyting picture produced by the Brethren. It is a secular documentary. It's goal isn't to convert but rather to inform. And so polygamy, polyandry, Mountain Meadows, and fundamentalism are as much a part of the story as the Haun's Mill, the  First Vision and the importance of eternal families.

In fact, many members of the LDS church have only a cursory understanding of their own history. Because I believe that it's impossible to fully believe in something you don't fully understand I would recommend this film to all members.

Those interviewed run the range. LDS General Authorities to LDS academics to non-Mormon scholars to former Mormons. The director purposely avoids identifying the Mormon-slant of each person so that the viewer will consider their comments without bias. This has lead both pro and anti- mormons to wrongly claim that the numbers of interviews are skewed against their point of view-- when actually the numbers are pretty even.

A quote by Hugh B. Brown, counselor in the First Presidency, in closing:
""Thoughts and expressions compete in the marketplace of thought, and in that competition truth emerges triumphant. Only error fears freedom of expression.""

""The Mormons"" tells more of the story.",1183939200,52,1667,5.201492537313433
2811769,5,B000P5FH4Y,"This documentary points out that relatively new religions have the disadvantage of having a paper trail leading to its origin. Mormon's have a sorted and well documnted history of polygamy, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and racism. The director tried to be fair considering that those issues would have been the elephant in the room if ignored. Don't quite a few religions have similar origins? These themes aren't exclusive to Mormons.
I have several friends that were Latter Day Saints. Two had wonderful experiences with the group while the third one refers to it as a controlling cult. The documentary didn't comprehensively explore the control issues that some ex-mormons seek recovery from. The director was more than fair to the Church in not pursuing rhis angle of the story.
I plan to buy the film on DVD as soon as it comes out.",1182038400,18,839,4.915492957746479
2811770,2,B000P5FH4Y,This was an interesting film of what non-mormons think the Mormons believe.  A majority of the film was spent interviewing those who were either not members or those that had left the church. A disproportionate time was also spent on contraversial issues that were an unfortunate but a small part of Mormon history. Most of the actual beliefs and practices of the church are not included in this film.,1180656000,12,401,4.811594202898551

Chapter 1

1 We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.
2 We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression.
3 We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.
4 We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.
5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.
6 We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.
7 We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.
8 We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.
9 We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.

10 We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.
11 We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.
12 We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.
13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.",1521158400,,2560,4.544468546637744

This video is split between about 1/3 information and 2/3 Protestant Evangelism, with the information more concentrated in the first half, then transitioning to 100% Protestant Evangelism at the end.
