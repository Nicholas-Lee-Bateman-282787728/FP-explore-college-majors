8247466,5,B0012RLWGG,"THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER SEASON 6

Following in the tradition of season's 3 and 5 this time around it is two coaches that have a genuine dislike for each other. At one end is the former welterweight champ Matt Hughes, and at the other current champ Matt Serra. The story is Hughes doesn't think Serra is a deserving champion, and Serra can't stand Hughes because of the way he acts and treats people. Now I would like to stat off the bat that each season has a coach that really impresses me, like Tito Ortiz and Jens Pulver before him Matt Serra did that for me on this season. I have a lot more respect for these guys due to how they treated their fighters on this show, Serra was a really good coach.

From the first episode Hughes and Serra have their opening face off with Danna White when they first get together. That of course leads to Matt Hughes playing head games by acting like he wanted Joe Scarola as his first pick. The thing is Joey is a good friend of Serra's, so naturally Serra picks Joey first letting Hughes pick his real first pick. That leads to the first fight of the season pitting Joe against Mac Danzig. But before that my pick to take the whole show Roman Mitichyan got injured during the evaluation, his visit to the doctor sets off one of the most memorable segments of the show, he goes crazy because he is told he can't fight. Unfortunately he has to leave the show and is replaced by Jon Koppenhaver. The fight between Joey and Mac was disappointing; Joey put himself in a triangle so he could get out of the fight. Of course Serra was not pleased with this at all.

In the second episode Joe starts on his whole feeling sorry for himself thing, which would continue for a couple more episodes. He even skips out on the next practice session, so Serra tells every one how he really feels about the situation. Serra even has to come to the house and talk to Joe, Joe even says he'll stay and help coach. After that Hughes puts down an optional Bible Study during his training session. Then once again Joe goes crazy and wanting to leave to see his girl, Serra gets beyond mad when he finds out. The fight that episode saw Dorian Price lose to Matt Arroyo due to a rear naked choke.

In this episode everyone got to watch a UFC pay per view event, and of course Joe was outside sulking. The drama keeps going on as Joe keeps up the sulking, and wanting to leave. Serra even tells him if he leaves he looses his job back home, even Danna White comes to talk to Joe and he still decides to leave. What a waste of air time this show wasted on him, so many others wanted to be there. In the fight Billy Miles comes up short against John Kolosci.

The next show starts with team Hughes being punished because Billy lost his fight. This is also the infamous confrontation between Dorian and the production crew, Dorian almost has to leave the show. Danna White lets him know what the deal is, and Dorian's commentary about the situation and Danna White is hilarious. The fight for this episode was Blake Bowman taking on Richie Hightower. This was an insanely quick fight with Hightower taking out Blake in the first round.

In this episode Mac lets his feelings be known about Blake, things get worse when Cole Miller beats Andy Wang at the TUF season 5 finale. Blake is cool with Cole and Mac is cool with Wang. Also Mac saves a bee, and wants to save the flies, he is one with nature. Paul learns that his 19 year old cousin has died so he has to leave the house after his fight, and Team Serra's Mac head made out of a milk carton is funny. The fight of the night was Troy Mandaloniz vs. Paul Georgieff, this is an excellent fight. The fight was really good both were throwing some good strikes, and both worked really well on the ground. When it finally gets back to the stand up Troy knocks Paul out with a nice right hand.

The next episode shows how Barrera breaks his hand during practice with Matt Hughes. Barrera gets a call from his wife who had a seizure while he was gone, so this whole episode he had a lot of challenges he had to face. The fight was Dan Barrera taking on Ben Saunders. Saunders gets dropped in the first round but recovers quickly and makes a triangle attempt, but Dan escapes it. When the fight is standing it is a wild brawl, but the other half of the first round is Dan standing there and Ben laying there. The second round was a mirror of the first when they were standing; Dan even got dropped by a knee.

The next episode Matt Hughes is talking about leaving the show because he believes that his team isn't listening to him, Danna White even has to come talk to him. After this talk between the two Hughes punishes his team. And Team Serra is all kinds of mad at George for not waking them up in the mornings. Jay rock ends up getting injured before his fight on this episode. The bout for the evening was Jared Rollins taking on George Sotiropoulos. George basically picks Jay Rock apart during this fight, and George takes Jay Rock out with a little over a minute left in the first. Jay Rock's impression of Serra is funny as well.

This episode was all about Tommy being a strong farm boy like Matt Hughes, and War Machine being a little nutty, Serra has some funny things to say about him in this episode. The finial fight was Tommy Speer vs. Jon Koppenhaver, the round starts with War taking Speer down and getting a rear naked choke. Tommy eventually gets on top and just rains down punishment with some ground and pound on War. The second round starts with Tommy taking War down with ease, and pounding again. Tommy ends up winning by judge's decision.

This episode is about Team Serra picking the next round line up, and some of his guys have to go to Team Hughes. Also it is about Mac being nothing but negative. The fight was Mac Danzig vs. Jon Kolosci; Mac dominates the fight and wins by rear naked choke.

In the next episode we have the coach's challenge, which is bowling. Matt Serra ends up beating Hughes in a really close game and getting 10 g's. Next up was the fight between Troy Mandaloniz and Matt Arroyo, the fight ended early in the first when Troy taps to an arm bar. The last fight of the episode was Richie Hightower taking on George Sotiropoulos. This fight ends when Richie taps to a kimora at the end of the first.

The next episode is the infamous upper decker show, were Jay rock goes off on Team Serra kicks down their door. The fight was Tommy Speer against Ben Saunders, Team Serra vs. Team Hughes again. The first round was good, both displayed good ground game. Second round was about the same, Tommy controlled with some ground and pound and getting the win. In the next episode Matt Arroyo gets an injured rib and chooses to leave the competition, even though the doctors say he can fight. So John Kolosci stepped up and took his place and got a rematch against Mac Danzig. The fight ends the same way he first did, Danzig wins by rear naked choke. The last semi final fight was Tommy Speer vs. George Sotiropoulos; Tommy wins the fight by knock out after he pokes George in the eye. So both of Hughes's guys are in the finals, I was rooting for Serra's team. So the show was over and all that was left was the finale.

The first fight of the night was Jonathan Goulet vs. Paul Georgieff; Goulet gets put to sleep by a rear naked choke with less then a minute left in the first. Next up is one of my favorite fights of the night pitting Dorian Price against Roman Mitichyan who had to leave on the first episode because of an injury. Roman wins this fight in seconds after taking his opponent down and getting a deep ankle lock. Next was John Kolosci taking on Matt Arroyo, with seconds left Arroyo locks a nice arm bar and forces John to tap. Next Richie Hightower got it on with Troy Mandaloniz, in one of the best fights of the night Troy knocks out Richie in the first round. Then Dan Barrera fought Ben Saunders in an excellent rematch from the show, Ben wins by decision after a great fight. Next George Sotiropoulos went against Billy Miles, and George dominates this fight and ends it with a rear naked choke. Next was Jared Rollins vs. Jon Koppenhaver  in a bloody brawl that saw Jon turn the fight around in round three with a knock out over Jayrock. Finally the fight between Mac Danzig and Tommy Speer is upon us, and Danzig straight dominates Tommy and chokes him out with a rear naked and becomes the ultimate fighter. Lastly is a classic between Roger Huerta and Clay Guida, Clay lands a sick punch on Roger after faking a take down. But Roger wins the fight with a rear naked choke, this was a great fight, classic for sure.

This was a great season of the ultimate fighter, even rivals' season 5 for the most entreating season ever. I recommend this box set to everybody out there, also it has some good special features like season 5 did.",1215734400,5,8857,4.349667271627344
