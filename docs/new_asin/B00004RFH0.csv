7921246,4,B00004RFH0,I first fell in love with MKR by reading the graphic novels (BTW - go get them!) So i went and got this tape. The animation is deffinatly lacking (this probably due to the GN's im use to. ^^;;) the VA's are horrid but I love it anyway! If you want the better deal I suggest getting the subtitled version.,989798400,,304,4.083333333333333
7921247,5,B00004RFH0,I've loved  Rayearth since the first time I saw it.  The second season is even better then the first.  You find out a lot more about the  girls families.  The only thing that bugged me was that teh showed the same flashbacks over and over again.  Other then that it was great!,971654400,2,276,4.211538461538462
