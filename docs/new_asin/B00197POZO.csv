8272230,2,B00197POZO,"I found it very depressing because the ""poor me"" attitude. My father was in Poston but he never expressed talked negatively about those days. He may have covered it up. My father was the oldest son of 5 children, the youngest was 7 months old. My grandfather lost his restaurant and taken away by the FBI because he was a Kendo instructor. It must have been horrible for him but he never allow it to take over his life. Everyone handled it differently and these people in the movie showed the negative side of their personal lives. It was tough for all. You have to let go and go on with your life. They seemed like they hung on to it and it affected them terribly. It's sad. I can't watch this movie again. I've seen others that were more better.",1442966400,,747,4.304964539007092
8272231,3,B00197POZO,"My innocent father with no sense of entitlement didn't object when his new Japanese in law immediately shared with him that he was interned,  he didn't even think to share what was happening to him at the same time in China when he was one generation more American than his Japanese counterpart.  You know,  internment sounds terrible immediately but stop likening them to concentration camps.  People raped by Japanese and Germans know more about suffering and humiliation and racism than anyone interned by America.  Pretty much anyone in Europe, Africa and Asia would have traded places with these unfortunate Americans.  The nonjapanese Hawaiians stationed on Jarvis island probably had a tougher time.

""Concentration camps.""  Holy crap.

I have to wonder if this smug outrage and longwindedness is trying to counter Pearl Harbor and the murders of native Hawaiians on the island of Niihau with the aid of nisei persuaded by Japanese military.  And if you served in the 442nd, you would think you would have more sympathy for fellow combatants imprisoned by the Japanese but who make less noise and certainly don't get as many documentaries about what they barely survived.

Do they know about Mrs. John Basilone?  The Highland Clearances?  The Trail of Tears?  Ever see ""Back to 1942""?  How about African American banishment?  Is that ""better than an internment camp""?  Do those poor souls not know who they are?

 I wish my father had gotten exposure to 1940s America even if it was playing baseball on the Rez.  But I wouldn't trade it with the ignominy of Niihau and Pearl Harbor and that ""my grand kids are all white"" blamed on racism and feelings of inferiority when the African American population seems to be enduring despite  suffering worse racism.

Speaking of which, isn't it appropriate to dig irrigation for the tribe that contributed code talkers to the war effort?  It's not like you died building the bridge over the river Kwai.

And I can't believe that no one shrewdly assessed that this was a strategic kindness on the part of the government.

April 23, 2014, former POW Les Canivet celebrated his 93rd birthday and remembers a Canadian soldier who had been captured with them being executed by the U.N. after the war, likely for treason and crimes against humanity:

""He was a Canadian Japanese soldier who grew up in a community in B.C.; that was only Japanese heritage,"" he said. ""When we were taken, he told the Japanese soldiers that he had been beaten in Canada by the white Canadians, and that he had grown up being abused for his heritage.""

When the captives were freed, this man was arrested, and tried to buy his way back into Canada by offering secrets he had learned about the Japanese during his time with them. His plan failed, and he was hanged shortly after.",1401494400,,2800,4.852320675105485
8272232,5,B00197POZO,"As a reader of history, particularly the past century and especially during World War II era, this movie epitomizes why we Americans are so often criticized by other countries as being hypocrites.  Prior to our involvement in World War II.  Our own policies at the time allowed nearly no immigration from the embattled European countries, particularly if the individuals were Jews.  Once Japan made an act of war at Pearl Harbor, our representatives quickly forced our own Japanese Americans into camps (they were given two weeks from the passage of law to get to their assigned camp).  This documentary focuses on the unique agenda of the Poston camp.

Poston was set amidst the tumbleweed desert land given to the Colorado River Indian Tribes in Arizona.  While not initially in contact with these Indians,(it was alluded that as years passed some were allowed to interact with them).  These Japanese along with their Japanese American family members (some were children of adult immigrants, who were not yet citizens, while others were Americans from several generations back) worked the land  digging deep trenches, so that the government could set up irrigation systems on behalf of the Native Americans on this Reservation.  Once completed, they were responsible to farm this area (most had no farming background).  Mind you, many of these individuals were professionals and while some people, such as medical doctors, nurses etc., were employed in the community or allowed to practice in small surrounding communities for those American not captive because of their skin, many of the Japanese were well-educated only to become laborers almost over night.

The government reels of that time assure us they were paid wages, so they could shop in the government run stores to buy things that weren't provided by Uncle Sam.  In our generosity, each family got a tiny room with a stove (dirty barracks that were no longer needed) and a cot.  They were also provided with three meals and the children were able to attend school, they were taught by interned Japanese teachers.  Eventually, the land was planted and the crops became their primary source of food at Poston and the abundance was sent to other camps or sold to ""real"" Americans.  As time passed, some of the Japanese got sent to other areas in America to support the war effort, apparently those selected once they were no longer under suspicion or considered more trustworthy (usually these were young adult males that were shown happily at work).

This documentary follows four survivors from this era who lived in this particular camp.  The emotional scars of being unacceptable by their fellow American peers because of their skin is just revolting.  The one male interviewee has never come to terms with his identity as a result.  Even after the war, these people couldn't return to life as normal, many had sold or given away all but what little they could carry.  Some lost their homes and of course, their jobs were filled after years of absence.  My heart broke for all of them.  This policy was indisputably racist and nationalist.  One woman in particular really stood out, as a Christian, she talked about the need to forgive as taught in the Christian faith, and her anger toward those responsible dispelled after she practiced forgiveness.  As a result, she was able to move forward, I greatly admire her for her strength and courage to chose this path.  Her father had come from Japan to Pastor, a Japanese church in California prior to the round-up.

While the government stated these people were being ""protected""; it sure didn't appear as such, especially since the many families were multiple generations sharing one room, given job assignments, eating in mess halls, surrounded by fences while being 'guarded' by soldiers with rifles.  A little research into today's FEMA camps throughout the U.S. are multiplying in number and size, while others have been updated and sent fresh, new supplies will have you wondering, who will next be ""protected"", particularly since billions of bullets have been purchased by DOHS, Social Security and other surprising governmental agencies.  I encourage the all American's to watch this movie, history does repeat itself and those who know nothing about the past are apt to repeat it.

Famous pastor, Martin Niemller is perhaps best remembered by the following statement made shortly after World War II had ended:

""First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me--and there was no one left to speak for me.""

We could add that our American's should incorporate, ""Then they came for the Japanese, and we did not speak out... because we were not Japanese"".

*1988 a law for Reparations was passed, over $1.6 billion in reparations were later disbursed by the U.S. government to Japanese Americans who had either suffered internment or were heirs of those who had suffered internment.  The equivalent was approximately $20,000 to each survivor.  In total, more than 60,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese emigrants were sent to these camps.

Of interest, though not cited in the documentary is the fact that very few of those of Japanese Americans in Hawaii were forced into camps.",1398297600,3,5451,4.969128996692392
8272233,5,B00197POZO,"We have seen other Japanese american internment camp(s) documentary and features, Passing Poston ranks as one of the best. We recommend this DVD especially of you had families like ours who were actually interned at Poston.",1363996800,4,223,5.222222222222222
8272234,5,B00197POZO,"I was lucky enough to watch the first showing of this movie at Parker High School in Parker, AZ. I was 17 at the time and this movie has been with me ever since. The small town of Parker is right on the edge of the Colorado River Indian Reservation where the Poston Camp is located, and yes, I am an American Indian myself, athough Im not from that reservation myself.

The movie made me cry and still does to this day, I asked a question of Rue and her answer is still as clear as the day I got to see the movie. I asked how she felt being connected to the tribe through her time at the camp, she replied ""I am proud to be connected to the land and the people who live here.""

This movie is wonderful and educational, some people don't like to think back on dark times like this but its a way to learn and move on. To be thankful for what you have got and what could have been, its opened my eyes to the fact that its not just Native Americans who suffer on the rez.",1297468800,5,967,3.953846153846154
8272235,5,B00197POZO,"I had the privilege of first seeing this movie at a screening with some of the filmmakers and participants at the National Museum of the American Indian. I don't think there was a dry eye in the audience by the end, and having just rewatched the DVD, I can attest to the fact that it has the same emotional impact on the small screen.

Japanese internment during WWII and the United States' treatment of the indigenous population are both painful subjects that cannot be ignored. This film deals with both in a respectful and dignified way, letting people tell their own stories. Anyone who watches it cannot help but share in the pain that this documentary highlights. It is terribly important, in my opinion, that people be aware of this history, for being aware of the history makes it impossible to look the other way when it happens again.",1229817600,10,844,4.6644295302013425
8272236,1,B00197POZO,"Although the subject matter, the WWII internment of Japanese American citizens and resident aliens in a camp on an Indian reservation, is a notable effort, I cannot recommend this film.  Some of the statements, especially about the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the internment cases, Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, are wrong.  The Court never declared the internment unconstitutional. The Court affirmed the power of the federal government to remove and detain American citizens without benefit of due process during war time solely based on ancestry.  The filmmakers lead viewers to believe the opposite.",1225584000,2,611,5.548387096774194
8272237,5,B00197POZO,"This movie is long overdue and very well done! Too little has been said, written, and filmed about the Internment and the vast injustice done to Americans -- Americans! -- because they ""looked like the enemy.""

Congratulations to Joe Fox and James Nubile for making ""Passing Poston."" The film is shot well, with a beautiful score, and allows the story to unfold gracefully, using the words of the three main participants.

The words and images of the principals are more than touching. They will break your heart. There are many places where you can (and should) cry. There is great honesty, a cautious hope, and a strong element of forgiveness.

I saw ""Passing Poston"" at the Sacramento International Film Festival on March 29, 2008. I sat next to Kiyo Sato, one of the principals, and her grandson. The best seat in the house.

This film will move you, and you will keep the DVD forever.
