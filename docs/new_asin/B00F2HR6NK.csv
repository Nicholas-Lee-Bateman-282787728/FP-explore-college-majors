The segments are fantastic - fun, engaging and he ran around the house singing the theme song! They couldn't make science any more fun, but even better is when he took his 5th grade science FCAT, he had a near perfect score. He had very good teachers, but the Superhero Training Network gave him just the extra boost he needed and made him realize that science is truly fun and fascinating.",1396828800,,474,4.337078651685394
8611705,5,B00F2HR6NK,"I have been an elementary science teacher for 20 years and this is the most exciting product I have used ever! My fifth and sixth grade students have bought in 100%. They are now ""Superhero Trainees"" who are learning science (and math and reading) in order to grow up to learn superpowers such as science, math, and engineering so they can save the world from hunger, pollution, climate change, natural disasters, etc. They now see the scientists and engineers as the modern day superheroes and want to be like them. They LOVE the videos and beg for more science!  I can't wait to get the next episodes!",1381881600,,603,4.635514018691588
