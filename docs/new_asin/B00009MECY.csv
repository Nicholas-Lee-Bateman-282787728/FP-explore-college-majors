7991824,3,B00009MECY,this is a great roy rogers movie why do they cut it for dvd you can put hours movies on dvds with out cuting them up and put them in color the way they were made.,1374278400,,162,3.5277777777777777
7991825,4,B00009MECY,I chose this rating because the Happy Trails Theater version edits out some of the film content in order to accommodate the memory lane chats with Roy and Dale at the beginning.,1363564800,,177,4.5625
7991826,5,B00009MECY,RR movies are always a cut above so many of the B movies.  Trigger is one of the most beautiful of the horses used by any one and rightly earned the name of the smartest horse in the movies.  Roy sings and acts earning him the nick name of King of the Cowboys.  Always a pleasure to see them together with Foy Willing and his band.,1357689600,,331,3.984848484848485
