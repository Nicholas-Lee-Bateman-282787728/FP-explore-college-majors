8098162,2,B0000E6FNV,"Me, I am neither an audio master nor a total newbie. I've played in a few bands and dabbled with home recording enough to know where to stick my 1/4"". But I want to learn more.

This DVD is geared at folks like me, and without getting bogged down in technical gobbledygook, it offers some decent info. My main gripe is that it's dry. If, like me, you're a fledgling in the music industry, then you probably have the attention span of a gnat. There's just so much to learn, and it's constantly changing every year, that you probably don't have the patience to sit through long lectures from the year 2005. What might've made this fun would've been some more dynamic content, graphic visuals (diagrams of signal flow, graphs of sound waves, or even cartoon animations of unlucky guitarists getting electrocuted) to spice things up.

Instead, it's more of a long, fireside chat which does povide some good tips, but you may find that the bulk of it doesn't apply to you. So we end up glazing over a bit.

Audio engineer Matt (forgot his last name) begins with the basics of PA signal routing and then covers each typical rock instrument one at a time: drums, bass, electric guitar, acoustic guitar. percussion, saxophone, lead vocals. Of greatest value is seeing how he positions the mics on drums and guitar cabinets. The rest is pretty obvious stuff that you probably know already.

The band used as an example is a metal band. So that means if you're setting up for country, blues, synth, techno, ska, reggae, jazz or of course polka, you're outta luck. There's no section on keyboards, so we all remain in the dark on how to mic a piano, Rhodes or the infinite irritation of all sound engineers: Hammond organ through a Leslie cabinet. And there's nothing on eliminating feedback which is probably the biggest (and loudest) problem you can face in a live setting.

So in the end I was left unfulfilled. If it was more entertaining I would've given it a pass. If it was boring but detailed I would've given it a pass. But instead it falls just below the pass level on both counts. Instead of blowing $20 bucks on this 60 min DVD, I suggest you hunt around YouTube for some informative bits.",1417564800,,2190,4.576530612244898
8098163,1,B0000E6FNV,"I am a professional  sound engineer and have been for over 15 years.  I am also an audio educator specifically in the fields of live sound and studio engineering.  I bought this DVD with the hopes of showing to one of my live sound classes.  I must say, this is the most disapointing video I have ever seen.  It was vague, undetailed,  incomplete and useless to all but the most naive band memeber. There are fudumantal concepts left out like mains power, crossover setup, load in/load out/ recording, ect... The ""instuctor"" keeps saying ""just do it untill it sounds good"" instead of explaining.  This DVD rushes through concepts to keep the running time under 60mins.  I would never use this in a class as educational material- ever.  If you want a video that is more complete - check out Live Sound Reinforcement.",1203465600,,815,4.683098591549296
8098164,4,B0000E6FNV,"I found this to be very enlightening. As a novice I had many questions.

This DVD answered many of them.

Although rathering boring with the presentation, I did learn a lot.",1173398400,,173,4.548387096774194
8098165,2,B0000E6FNV,"This DVD seems to be oriented to the hard-rock wannabe crowd that already hangs around bands and their gear, and just needs something to build their skills a little (and their confidence).  Certain knowledge was assumed, and in my opinion the material covered wasn't that much.  I guess for some folks it would be perfect, but if I'd been able to preview it (or read a review like this one), I'd never have bought it.  The other DVD I got (""Live Sound Reinforcement"") was *way* better, and the folks who got to see both DVDs all agreed.",1170288000,,536,4.505154639175258
8098166,4,B0000E6FNV,Generally Rock House DVD are excellent. This is good start on how to mic instruments including vocals.,1168300800,,102,5.0588235294117645
8098167,4,B0000E6FNV,"This DVD shows you the techniques of mic-ing several instruments. Also it explains the use of EQ's, effects, and dynamic processors. If you are a beginner or intermediate want to refresh your skills you can go with it. But if you are a pro, don't bother your self watching it.

I'm rating it 4/5 because it could be much better by including more instruments like: strings, pianos, etc.",1167177600,,385,4.661764705882353
