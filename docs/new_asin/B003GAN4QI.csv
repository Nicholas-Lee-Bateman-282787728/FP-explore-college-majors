4122097,1,B003GAN4QI,"Casino Royale was 10 times better than Quantum of Solace and Octopussy was memorable. Ultimate should include all JB's movies...I'll wait for the beyond ultimate edition. Im still happy with my $99, 21 SD DVD ""ultimate collection"". Even the box they came in was cool!",1275609600,21,267,4.955555555555556
4122098,1,B003GAN4QI,"Once more, MGM decides to jerk around those of us who purchased the first three set and were waiting for something new.  There aren't too many businesses that can continue to treat their customers with total contempt and survive.",1275609600,24,229,4.871794871794871
4122099,5,B003GAN4QI,"Waited a long time for these to be on a bluray deal.  Never seen them look this good, especially Dr. No.  I only wish the entire series was here.  I definitely recommend.",1275436800,32,170,4.25
4122100,1,B003GAN4QI,"Why would they again sell these in another ""packaging"" (there was bundle like this before) and not put out the remaining movies -- which by now have all been restored by Lowry already ???  I understandand this kind of packaging as not much to do with them, but I am getting highly irritated and annoyed by MGM ... get a grip and put the remaining Bond movies on Blu-Ray on sale already please !!!",1271548800,53,396,4.351351351351352
4122191,5,B003GAN4QI,"Peerless entertainment from the master spy.  Beautiful re-mastering and encoding.  Some look cleaner and clearer than they probably did in the theater, but all look better - much better.  They sound better too.  No need to outline the plots, if you don't know them by now, ask your Dad, heck, ask his Father!  They've both seen them.  But this is the ultimate way to enjoy them (thusfar).  These diamonds are forever.  Bring on the rest.",1278374400,2,437,4.733333333333333
4122192,3,B003GAN4QI,"Well I won't lament about the quality Bond titles missing mentioned in other reviews but I was disappointed that there is no box for this set like the DVD Bond collections.  It is just 11 bond movies shrinkwrapped together.  I picked this up when it was $69.99 briefly.

I would gladly trade Die Another Day out of this set for Goldeneye (or just about any other Bond movie).",1277164800,5,375,4.485294117647059
4122193,5,B003GAN4QI,"I get that people are holding out, but there's no reason to rate this poorly because of it's contents.

Here's the facts:
The MSRP Stinks.
Amazon has been selling this set on deals for around 6.5 to 9 bucks per movie, which is pretty darned good.
It contains ALL blu-rays of bond that are available to date EXCEPT for the last two, which are technically still best-selling blu-rays, so to find them in a set is rare.

Having successfully avoided almost all bond film purchases on DVD, this is a great value --- if you tried to complete your set on DVD previously,  I can see how you'd feel ripped off, but this is far from the double-dip attempt that people are making this out to be.

In short, if it goes on sale again and you don't have anything in the set, GET IT.",1276732800,12,768,4.275862068965517

4122195,1,B003GAN4QI,"I agree with the one-star ratings. Already have the other three three-Blu-ray sets and the two individual Blu-ray (Quantum, Casino). So this set is useless to those like me who have already plunked down the bucks for the others.",1276214400,7,228,4.871794871794871
4122196,5,B003GAN4QI,"TThis collection includes 11 of the 14 James Bond Movies released to date on blu-ray. The first four and most highly rated of Sean Connery' films as JB, The only films not previously released on blu-ray are 'Never Say Never Again', which MGM does not own and consequently is not available in this collection and Casino Royale. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace are available now in blu-ray from MGM and are not included. These movies are both selling very well and can be expected to do extremely well with Father's Day coming up. MGM is not required to sell these movies as a part of a $99 bundle. Their shareholders would be entitled to kick out management if they did that.

I cannot say that I have seen the entire collection. I have seen several of them on blu-ray (thank you Netflix) and find the video and audio Incredibly good for their age- Dr. No was released nearly 50 years ago and the transfer to blu-ray in 2008 won a 4.5 stars out of a 5.0 possible from High Def Digest - to quote the introductory sentence ""Wow. Just wow"". HDD has the toughest and most knowledgeable critics on blu-ray transfers. See [..]  I have ordered this collection from Amazon and look forward to many hours of enjoyment. For those of you who complain that it does not contain all 22 movies - grow up! This is a tremendous collection at a great price. Those who pass it up are the same people who would not purchase The Lord of the Rings trilogy because it did not include the extended edition as well as the theatrical edition. Pleasure delayed may be pleasure thrown away.

I recommend this collection to any James Bond fan. These are 'fun-to-watch' films that requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief. If you are hunting for a great classic such as Citizen Kane or Schlinder's List, these are not your movies. These are popcorn movies that let you take a break from the grind of everyday life.",1275609600,16,1895,4.518950437317784
4122197,4,B003GAN4QI,"I can't comment on the quality of these videos since I don't own them and don't yet own a blu-ray player.  But let me offer an opinion on the selection of movies:  Overall it is quite good.  The first four movies in the franchise--Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball--are the best of the Connery movies.  I feel Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun and For Your Eyes Only are among the better Moore entries.  The World is Not Enough is one of the better Brosnan movies. That makes eight of the better movies in the series.  Of the others, Moonraker and Die Another Day are silly and preposterous.  License to Kill is unremittingly bloody, harsh and humorless, qualities that ""killed off"" Timothy Dalton, an otherwise excellent Bond. So, in my opinion, you're getting a very good collection (although not ""Ultimate"") of Bond movies on blu-ray for what seems like a very good price.",1275609600,6,912,4.6625
4122198,5,B003GAN4QI,"I actually own all 11 Bonds on Blu-ray and I can tell you the quality is absolutely superb.

As is well known, MGM is in serious financial trouble, that's why there haven't been any new Blu-ray Bond releases for a while.  I'd like to see the others as well, but only if they do as good a job as was done on this group.  In any case, that has Nothing to do with this offering! I can't believe how many are complaining about THIS set because MGM hasn't produced Blu-rays for the Other movies yet.  Sheesh!

As far as Amazon's use of the word ""Ultimate"" in this deal:  ""Ultimate"" does not mean ""Complete"", although for the MGM Blu-ray Bonds the word ""Ultimate"" regarding this collection is accurate.  Remember, though, ""Ultimate"" can also correctly be used to mean ""Last"".  I hope this isn't prophetic.  Regardless, if you don't already have most of these, take advantage of this deal ($9 a Blu-Ray!) while you can.",1275609600,19,912,4.54601226993865
4122199,1,B003GAN4QI,"How can they call ultimate collection a simple selection of movies thay omits various titles of a real ultimate collection!? Where are ""GOLDENEYE"", ""QUANTUM OF SOLACE"", ""TOMORROW NEVER DIES"", ""A VIEW TO A KILL""? Some of them are not even available in ""old"" DVD yet! Please MGM, if you want a collection to be ULTIMATE you just don't call it ultimate, you must make it ultimate!",1275609600,20,377,4.7272727272727275
4122200,1,B003GAN4QI,"I would like to own the Bond movies on blu-ray but not like this, I want a complete collection.",1275609600,26,95,4.052631578947368

8396432,5,B003GAN4QI,"I wish I had bought theses along time ago. If I had know they were gonna come out in that cardboard book I would have. I mean it looks nice, but it want fit on my dvd self. I was waiting for them to all come out as a set. But I don't like the Bond 50 set. I much perfer to have theses 11 in the cases and the 2 new ones I already have on bluray and wait for the other 9 to come out seperatly. Mainly cause That box set want fit on my dvd self. Who ever decided that should be shot. It's a poor design and it seems the disc could get scratched up rather easily. Anyways theses cases look way nicer and you don't have to pull them all out just the one. And I know there's quite a few other people out there that agree with me.",1348704000,,724,3.707792207792208
8396433,3,B003GAN4QI,"This is a great way to get a jump start on your Bond BluRay collection, but for $299, it is a non-starter.  That is a high $$ per BluRay ratio - especially considering the lack of special features, etc.  But I have seen it go on sale.  I actually purchased this entire set for $69.99 from Amazon in June of 2010.  Which was great.  In all honesty, I think that price may have been a mistake as just a couple hours later the price was raised to $99 for the remainder of that day.

Bottom line, if it is in the Gold Box, it may be a good deal, otherwise skip it.",1321056000,,560,3.955357142857143
8396434,5,B003GAN4QI,"I own this 11 sets movie collection (Blu-Ray). Now that the franchise is not RIP, hope that MGM will release the others, making it complete, and may be sell it as ONE set. I will get it.",1295395200,,186,4.054054054054054
8396435,5,B003GAN4QI,"I bought this set when it was $99 so for that price it was a steal, probably wouldn't buy it for the current price.
As for the movies, there are a few strange gaps but you can easily pick them up separately. All very good picture & sound quality and it's James Bond so they're all excellent movies.
Really enjoyed watching the Conney movies again, best Bond ever in my opinion.",1294790400,,377,4.323943661971831
8396436,5,B003GAN4QI,"Yes, that's correct the box sets never bothered to include License To Kill or Man With The Golden Gun. The box sets also have the worst packaging this side of the 98 Cent Store, horrible flimsy cardboard pages that have a circular foam disc (that rips off) to hold the disc in place.
This way you at least get every available Bond in individual cases, with some form of artwork, and will look ten times better on your shelf.
The bad reviews? Just the usual complaints from people stating the obvious. I was personally so offended by the box sets (as a big Bond fan) I returned them to purchase the individual disc, and this is what you'll get here.",1287446400,5,648,4.408333333333333
8396437,5,B003GAN4QI,"The price and quantity of Bond movies is awesome!  My only vice is the Blu-Ray quality doesn't appear noticeably different from a DVD; it could be because of the age of the original movies and the ability to change the format/quality from DVD to Blu-Ray.  In any event, the price for each movie amounts to about $10 per Blu-Ray movie -- I doubt you could find a better deal, even if all 11 movies had been DVD instead of Blu-Ray!  I paid about $110 for the 11-movie set.",1283644800,2,470,4.318181818181818

8396439,1,B003GAN4QI,"This is about double what it would cost to buy the three Blu-ray boxed sets separately. I got all three, and they're absolutely fantastic. Great job with remastering: the picture quality and sound are trully blu-ray worthy. Not sure about how they play on other players, but on the PS3 they work like a charm. A definite must-have.",1282003200,8,331,4.724137931034483
8396440,5,B003GAN4QI,"For a true Bond fan, the Blue ray collection is a fabulous one that will keep one glued to the TV for a Bond-A-Thon anytime they want.  So, invest in quality films like these that can be enjoyed over and over for 007 is always entertaining at any hour on any day at any age!",1278460800,3,274,3.981818181818182
