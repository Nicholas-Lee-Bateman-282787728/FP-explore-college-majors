7915868,3,B00002IIYI,"Based on the play ""Self Storage.""

A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the ""Costume Killer"" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.

There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a ""lighter"" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.

This is absolutely worth getting for Ron Perlman's performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions. He's just simply fun to watch.

Perlman's performance and David Dukes' performance (he's in only the last two scenes but he's great) are the reasons this movie gets 3 stars instead of 2.",1103673600,4,1236,4.655963302752293
7915869,3,B00002IIYI,Arye Gross and Tom Wood (U.S. Marshals) play friends who are trying to make it big and trying to make a big movie. Their sponser is Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix). The 2 find shelter in a storage place and thats where they meet the strange Ron Perlman (Hellboy)..who may or may not be the costume killer who kills his victims with window cleaner...but it turns out hes an actor portraying the killer in a movie directed by Kristy Swanson (Buffy The Vampire Slayer). Soon they all join forces into making a fresh and reallife movie about the costume killer. But after that it just turns too dark. Swanson is sexy and gorgeous....Gross and Wood are funny as hell...Pantoliano is a scream and Perlman is extremely hilarious. Also starring David Dukes as the real costume killer. The end is sort of forced.,1093478400,2,799,4.673758865248227
