8165168,5,B000LXH5GS,"At first,it's sort of like what are the chances of finding an ""Elgin"" in the Athens,Greece phone book?This is a wonderful sport though. What better way to look beyond the short-termism that plagues us these days?Have your accountant tag along and all that. Financially,this sport isn't for the feint of heart. Lipton with his Shamrocks I-V would persevere from loss to loss. For Koch,I suppose politics takes priority. Today these teams need all the professional endorsements. The financial underpinnings have changed. The boat engineering has improved with all the relevant variables. Team Alinghi is a case in point. They've taken this to a higher level. Many of the lessons put to plaques and lessons from the guru were the same lessons taught to me by my parents as I was growing up. For me,I have to remember where I was in 2003 when this was happening. Oh,I remember. Bush was looking for bin Laden in the ""caves,""not opening a  bottle of Cottagnoud Cave de Tilleuls '02.18 seconds shy from 56 minutes,it isn't long enough,but all the production values from the time are there. I'm sure I should of been in New Zealand in 2003 to get more of this. Omega time is running up and down. I know some New Zealand fans,but how can you help them when they're suffering from mechanical failure. I'm sure Russell Coutts loves it all.",1481673600,,1329,4.778260869565218
8165169,4,B000LXH5GS,"The DVD Alinghi is more like an edited home video than an in depth documentary of the Cup Run.  Those who can't get enough of wonderful sailing images and some great on the deck looks won't be dissapointed; however, if you are looking for a sophisticated look at the America's Cup journey this is not for you.  Without spliced in segments from TV coverage this video would have earned a 2-3 stars.  Perhaps its greatest strength is in the folly that became New Zeland's pathetic attempt at a defense and a great clip of the infamous NZ demasting...  May be a little overpriced for what you get but entertaining nonetheless.",1122422400,12,623,4.636363636363637
