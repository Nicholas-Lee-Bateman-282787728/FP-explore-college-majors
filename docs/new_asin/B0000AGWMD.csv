6 of the12 action filled chapters with great fist fights, horsemanship and pretty good cliffhangers, we find movie serial queen Linda Stirling(and what a great one she is!) taking over as the Black Whip(no Zorro here) after he's killed by the baddies. Aided by a federal agent, she dons her mask, rides out of her secret hideout behind the waterfall)repeatedly), and rides, shoots and whips, literally, up a storm.

My daughters really enjoy watching her in Tiger Woman and Mystery Island- which are excellent and show an empowered woman who does it all while still being well dressed and rough and tumble elegant.  The film quality here is a bit grainy and dark but overall fine; moreover, you need to buy volunme 2 to complete the story.

Overall, great family movie night fun!",1445126400,,961,4.835365853658536
