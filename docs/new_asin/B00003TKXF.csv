7919442,4,B00003TKXF,"The dance troupe ""Mazowsze"" does a wonderful performance in Russia of folk dancing and songs from various regions of Poland.  Their energy and perfection in performing is incredible! I have always enjoyed seeing the ""Cossack style"" dancing with men doing leaps that defy the imagination.  If you enjoy traditional folk dancing and singing, this should make you a ""happy camper"".  The only negative is rather dim lighting at times making it somewhat difficult to see exactly what is going on.",1215561600,,491,5.1125
