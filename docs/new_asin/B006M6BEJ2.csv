5003885,1,B006M6BEJ2,"This guy has been dead for a hot minute, and someone is already looking to cash in...

Something tells me Andy Rooney would not have wanted this...",1325116800,3,147,4.444444444444445
5003886,1,B006M6BEJ2,"I started watching 60 Minutes at its inception in 1968 when I was eight years old.  Mike Wallace has been a life-long hero of mine, with Harry Reasoner, Morley Safer, Ed Bradley, Steve Kroft, Lesley Stahl, Diane Sawyer, and more recently, Scott Pelley, Bob Simon, Anderson Cooper, and the beautiful Lara Logan not far behind.  The careers these people have had are amazing. They are journalistic warriors, fighting the good fight. They identify these tremendously significant situations and highlight them for us, showing both sides of the issue and the weaknesses or strengths of both sides.  They better their viewers in ways few in the media world can equal. We walk away from the couch much better educated about the issues after every episode. We are able to vote better, and share our views more effectively and with more confidence.  Even our elected representatives often get the real story from 60 Minutes.  The show has remained substantive and penetrating for its entire run.  Even the celebrity highlights are meaningful and captivating.  60 Minutes is the gold standard in journalistic relevance and merit.

Which is why I could never comprehend the Andy Rooney segment.  I don't intend to be mean to the man, but he has now died and I think it's important to be accurate about his legacy. There is no ""Best of Andy Rooney,"" at least from the 60 Minutes phase of his career. It was all bad. The old geezer was vapid and vain.  His repertoire included inventorying the junk in his desk, reviewing letters people wrote and stuff they sent to him, profiles of assorted stacks of garbage around his office, and every manner of pointless banter about nothing.  Here the guy had a piece of the 60 Minutes time slot, and he utterly and entirely wasted it for years--only perhaps one segment a season had anything meaningful or important in it.  I only watched it to see if he would yet again squander those precious minutes.  It was a lot like watching a losing baseball team; one becomes fascinated by watching the spectacle of the team lose game after game, season after season.

And the man's fixation on himself was nothing less than weird.  Even his final installment had an admonishment to us to not bother him if we were to see him at a restaurant.  He was really captivated by his own notoriety.  In my mind he was notorious only for being vacuous and wasteful.  That segment could have been used to identify so many important societal trends that a person with his years could have put into some type of historical context.  Instead, he showed us the stuff in his drawers or closets.  I know the demographic of 60 Minutes is older, but I thought that was all the more reason to put someone in that slot who was still capable of making a real contribution to the universe of ideas.  Andy, instead, squandered his time and ours. Having him on the show for so long with his mindless babble was nothing less than geriatric affirmative action.  It was an unfortunate display.

If 60 Minutes decides to replace Mr. Rooney, I hope they will put someone in there with a merit which is congruous with the previous portions of the show.  Yeah, a little humor might be fun, but there has to still be real substance.  There wasn't any with Mr. Rooney.  It was a few minutes of intellectually empty calories.  I'm not glad he is dead.  I'm sad about it, as a matter of fact.  But I'm glad he's no longer part of the 60 Minutes line-up.  They can do much, much better.",1331942400,,3469,4.639344262295082
5003887,5,B006M6BEJ2,"ANDY ROONEY LIVES ON, with these 2 DVDs!!!!
I still watch ANDY each SUNDAY, after 60 Minutes!!
Just wondering what kind of ""minor"" surgery he had.
He would probably say ""lets just skip that part""...
RIP ANDY!!!!",1331510400,,211,4.72972972972973
5003888,5,B006M6BEJ2,i really enjoys these two dvds they were excellent i think that andy was a great guy he tell it like it is. I would like to see other peoples puchase these two dvds. They are excellent five stars plus.,1329264000,3,201,4.05
5003889,5,B006M6BEJ2,I have been an Andy Rooney fan for quite some time. When they would show his segments on 60 Minutes I thought that they were too short. Now I have the dvd I can watch Andy whenever I choose to do so. GREAT DVD.,1329004800,4,210,3.7954545454545454
5003890,4,B006M6BEJ2,It is a nice tribute to Andy Rooney - however it is not something that you set down to and watch both discs on the same day.  We watch it mainly on Sunday nights after 60 Minutes just to get our A R Fix!!!!,1328400000,3,206,3.6818181818181817
5003891,5,B006M6BEJ2,A very nice selection of Andy's comments on two DVDs from CBS Television available from Amazon. He is dearly missed on 60 minutes!,1328313600,2,130,4.695652173913044
5003892,5,B006M6BEJ2,"About a decade ago, I began tuning in to ""60 Minutes"" just to get Andy Rooney's wisdom of the week.  He had a solution for everything - why shoelaces are the way they are. The logic of how many peanuts are packaged and marketed in a can.  I took notes on his evaluation of ""lemon-enhanced"" consumer products that actually have no lemon.

Without Andy, I would never have known that automotive companies have design teams that focus on the sound of a car door closing, and the sound of a car's horn.

To me, Andy was the leader who taught us to ""read between the lines"" of life experience and exposure.  I now diligently read labels because of Andy.

Andy was a brilliant writer, correspondent and un-intentional educator of American cultural literacy.  I will always miss him.

As video collections go, I would add this DVD set to the bookshelf of classics like Plato, Homer and Socrates.  Well, I just did that.

I'll probably watch this DVD presentation at least twice-a-year.

Money well-spent.",1328227200,7,997,4.705202312138728
5003893,5,B006M6BEJ2,"The Best of Andy Rooney, well that should just say it all right there.  He is a journalist missed by many of us.  Yet this dvd will bring him back to life.",1328140800,2,155,3.8125
5003894,3,B006M6BEJ2,I would love to know WHEN this is scheduled to be released?  Why is there not some kind of expected release date?  The details say that this will be created on demand when ordered - so if I ordered it several weeks ago - shouldn't it have been created by now?,1325548800,,259,4.0588235294117645
5003895,5,B006M6BEJ2,"Time will tell, but I think the DVD will be a success.  His family will burdened with extra cash to spend.  I feel sorry for them!  What to buy next...  thanks to Andy.  I personally had hoped that 60 minutes would run of best of the best of his at the end of each 60 minutes show, sort of like how Peanuts is rerun even though Charles S. is long gone, but not forgotten.  I am happy to have the oppertunity to purchase a two set DVD of his best, whenever it comes out.  It will be like he never left us.",1325462400,3,504,3.8823529411764706
8500591,5,B006M6BEJ2,Requested gift for a family member's birthday & was he most pleased. Sat down & watched it immediately. I was praised for gifting it.,1455494400,,133,4.583333333333333
8500592,5,B006M6BEJ2,"Enjoyed watching these old segments. I've always liked Andy Rooney's off-beat humor and unique view of the things. This two-disc set consists of segments done over many years of the show. Its almost like a time-capsule of the past four (or five) decades. Disc one has about two hours of peoples favorite episodes, and disc two has the same of the episodes that were Andys own favorites. Im happy adding this set to my video collection.",1450310400,,435,4.7368421052631575
8500593,5,B006M6BEJ2,"Andy Rooney covers the full gamut of topics which goes from funny to serious.  Some say that he was unnecessary on the show, but, I'm so thankful that the producer had the great intelligence to include him in every show.  He was our inner voice - he spoke about things that many of us would have liked to complain about.  He expressed our feelings towards different subjects like terrorism or the war in Iraq.  And then on the next show he could be incredibly silly.  Andy Rooney was an American, decent, witty, and our kind of person.  Because he honestly shared himself with us  and never failed to be great, I gave the collection 5 stars.

However, the organization of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  The topics are organized in categories and the categories are all numbered.  However, each episode is not distinguished from the others in that category making it impossible to go directly to a favorite episode.  Once you get to that category, you have to fast forward until you get to your episode that you would like to view.  Each DVD is 2 hours long bringing the collection to a total of 4 hours of viewing.  And I believe that another reviewer brought up the point that more of his earlier work could have been included.  Perhaps CBS will release an additional DVD containing more material.  Let's hope so.

If you liked Andy Rooney, you will most definitely like this collection.  It's wonderful and it feels like home just hearing his voice again.  I wish he could have lived much, much longer.",1407196800,,1510,4.57089552238806

8500595,5,B006M6BEJ2,"I'm saying ""I love it"" because I have heard most of Andy Rooney's reviews. But this one will remain unopened as it is for a friend for Christmas who is a big fan of Mr. Rooney's.",1387065600,,178,3.9722222222222223
8500596,3,B006M6BEJ2,You need to really like Andy Rooney to enjoy these cd's. The person this was purchased for by request it enjoyed it because she was an Andy Rooney fan!!,1371600000,,152,4.275862068965517
8500597,5,B006M6BEJ2,"Andy Rooney and I have had a standing relationship ever since he first appeared on 60 minutes.  I may not have always agreed with him, but I always respected what he said.

Andy taught me a great deal and brought a lot information that I did not know to light.  It wasn't information about current events but information regarding things that effected everyday life.  He did it in style like I was listening to an old uncle of mine.  That is what attracted me to him and what drove to me to get his collection.  Now whenever I need some advice from wise Andy, I just have pull one of the CDs out.  Some of his wisdom penetrated.",1359331200,,628,4.271186440677966

8500600,4,B006M6BEJ2,Grew up listening to Andy Rooney on 60 minutes every Sunday night.  I had forgotten many of the quirky ways he presented real life and said the things we all have said or wanted to say.  Well worth the cost.,1333929600,,207,4.15
