3971445,3,B002R5V7MG,"These ""critics"" are possibly part of the Dudamel publicity machine, reviewing a DVD they have not yet seen, by recalling the live TV event of a while ago. I also was impressed by Dudamel, but these ""critics"" cannot properly comment on the visual editing or the quality of the sound or its DVD transfer, etc. There are also no comments regarding the wonderful John Adams piece which we also saw on television.

These ""critics"" might do well to rein in their egos and wait until they can view the actual DVDs being released to the public and in the meantime hold on to the terrific Bernstein/Vienna Philharmonic performance already available.",1257638400,9,640,4.818181818181818
3971446,5,B002R5V7MG,"A note to L. Crist and a thank you for his insights.  I am a double bassist and also teach the instrument.  So I can share your point of view.  I am also a Mahler addict.  The performance was electrifying, and this young man brought out portions of the Mahler 1 that I didn't even know where there. As often as I've heard this symphony, the young maestro's approach was so intense, so passionate, and so obviously carefully studied that it was as if I were hearing this masterpiece for the first time.  I also agree that the sound engineering at the time of live recording leaves much to be desired, and I hope that over the next 2 months before the DVD is released (I've already gotten my name in for a copy) an ""orchestra savvy"" engineer will take over the controls.

Are we looking at a future Bernstein?",1256256000,18,807,4.346666666666667
3971447,5,B002R5V7MG,"I watched this performance October 21, 2009 over KCET, the local PBS station, and found the video and audio both excellent.  Well .... maybe the audio will be a little better balanced when the DVD is released.  (Having played in an orchestra, I have my own ideas of how recordings should sound.)

The first work was John Adams' ""City Noir"", a very complex work which is very difficult to play, and probably quite foreign to most people's musical experience.  The orchestra was up to the challenge, and Dudamel had certainly mastered the score.  Don't expect to fall in love with this piece the first time you hear it!  However, repeated hearings should reveal more and more of the inner voices, and I look forward to hearing it again.

The second work was Gustave Mahler's Symphony #1, for which Dudamel has a special affinity and love.  Any Mahler lover (yes, I'm one) will have heard many different performances already.  This one is unusual -- it is over the top.  Dudamel brings some new insights, and stirs the orchestra to a fever pitch at the right moments.  And he's not afraid of slow tempos when they're appropriate.  This is a very exciting performance, and in my opinion, true to Mahler's intentions.  I place it second to none -- it's at the top of the heap of recorded performances for this masterpiece.  I just hope he records the other Mahler works on DVD!

On the basis of this one evening of watching him and listening to the results, I placed orders on Amazon for several other DVDs with Dudamel conducting.  I don't think he's a flash in the pan.  I believe he will be one of the great conductors of the 21st century, and I feel fortunate to live in LA, where I'll be able to see him and the orchestra live.",1256169600,62,1727,4.5372168284789645
3971448,5,B002R5V7MG,"I've just seen and heard via local public TV (PBS: Great Performances) the Mahler First Symphony in D Major played by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of their new music director, Gustavo Dudamel, in his inaugural concert.  Clearly, the Philharmonic saw this as an historic event: it chose to perform the Mahler Symphony in the 100th anniversary year of its first US performance (December 1909, New York Philharmonic, Mahler conducting).  For me, however, there was a bit of skepticism.  Having heard some hyperventilated ballyhoo about Mr. Dudamel and having also read a few less favorable assessments of his orchestral leadership, I began listening with the queasy feeling I was about to be let down.

It wasn't long, though, before I was quite deeply under the spell woven by Mahler, the Phil, and Mr. Dudamel. As time went on I became ever more impressed with the whole musical experience.  To be sure, it wasn't the easiest show to put on.  Mahler was a composer of more than usual complexity and rife with internal conflicts, such that even the most seasoned interpreter might very well go astray.  How then should such a young conductor (28), still new to his orchestra, pull off this demanding feat?  And yet he did, I believe, from the opening pseudo-pastorale, through the scherzo-cum-lndler and the mock funeral march, and on to the powerful finale wherein the whole French horn section--obedient to Mahler's instruction--stood up to blare out their triumphal message.  (I counted only five of the seven horns the score calls for; perhaps two were offstage.)

With Mahler, it turns out, nothing is quite what it seems to be.  Even the cuckoo in the first movement gets his notes wrong, singing a fourth instead of a third, and in a most insistent way.  The second movement, called a scherzo, seems at times to be almost a typical Austrian lndler (country dance)--but with a less-than-dancelike trio.  The ""funeral march"" seems to begin with some solemnity, but its tune is a children's round (Bruder Martin) soon offset with klezmerlike popular dance motifs.  Not until the last part of the last movement do all these centrifugal elements become subsumed in a grand reconciliation in the original D Major tonality not heard since the beginning. The beauty, lushness, and exquisite polish of Mahler's music are traps for the unwary, the sublime masking the ridiculous.  Not until Shostakovich does such a brilliant symphonic satirist and parodist appear again, I suspect.

Mr. Dudamel, born to musical parents in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, on January 26, 1981, got an early start in ""the system,"" through which young Venezuelans--otherwise perhaps tempted into less savory pastimes--are given musical instruction and thus inducted into constructive activities in wholesome social groups.  Dudamel joined one such group--the Simn Bolvar Youth Symphony Orchestra--as a violinist and became its conductor at age 18).  Later he conducted that orchestra in a performance of Mahler's Fifth Symphony now available as a CD on this website.  In 2004 he won the Mahler Conducting Competition in Germany, which accompanies a good number of other honors and awards to his credit.

Dudamel seems to have good rapport with the LA Phil: he treats the players--several greatly his senior--with respect and appreciation, and they seem to respond in the same terms.  His joy and enthusiasm for music-making seem to be contagious, widely infecting the talented players of the Phil, who outdid themselves in brilliance and polish throughout this inaugural performance, which Dudamel conducted without a score, but with confidence, conviction, sensitivity, and dynamism.

The resulting performance was surely a success for all.  I found it fully enjoyable, interesting, exciting, and musically satisfying, with nothing noticeably amiss or lacking.  Indeed,  I don't believe I've ever heard the Mahler First sounding so fresh and coherent before.  Hooray!

It looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship between Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic, one which will bless music-lovers not only in the City of Angels, but everywhere!

I recommend the Mahler First with enthusiasm.  (Not having heard the other items in this concert, I'll have to remain tacit on them.)",1256083200,32,4268,5.235294117647059

The PBS broadcast was spoiled by terrible compression artifacts in the video, plus annoying audio dropouts, pops and clicks.  I am looking forward to this DG release so that we can re-live this performance for years to come without these distracting flaws.

Dudamel's interpretation of the Mahler was detailed, exceptionally well prepared, and exciting.  Every nuance came through, every melody was clearly heard, and the orchestral balance was flawless.

The conductor, the orchestra and -- yes, them too -- the technicians/artists who made the video have done a fantastic job of bringing this epic work to life.  Have seen many performances of this symphony over the years, I can't get enough of watching this version performed -- the video work brings you absolutely up close and inside the orchestra, close witness to the consummate professionalism of all the musicians.

3971454,3,B002R5V7MG,"Maestro Dudamel will give us a Mahler First worthy of his talent.  I didn't mind the slowness of the first movement so much, but the pulling about of the tempo at the start of the scherzo was just ugly.  Most disappointing, though, was the utter lack of Jewishness in the slow movement.  When I heard George Manahan conduct this work the trumpets wailed and wept so in the ""Jewish wedding"" episodes that I burst out laughing.  Here the trumpets are hardly audible, and these moments go for nothing.  Compare Bernstein (DG CD or video) or Horenstein here if you want to know how it should sound.  The bass solo at the start of this movement was ""beautiful"" rather than grotesque.  Overall this is a good performance, but it's a bit early in The Dude's career to consider this a final view.  I'm as enthusiastic about Dudamel's talent as anyone, but enthusiasm shouldn't develop into idolatry.

I found City Noir surprisingly interesting, considering how much I dislike most new music.  I also enjoyed the documentary, and I hope that the promise of Dudamel's relationship with the LAPO will be fulfilled.

3971455,4,B002R5V7MG,"I have nothing to say about the Adams piece, it had no attraction for me.

The Mahler is what I paid for, having seen the television broadcast. This is a crucial piece of music for me in my life, I have heard dozens if not over 100 performances of this piece.

The tempos are undeniably slow, my touchstone is the Bruno Walter performance with the Columbia orchestra. While this is not terribly annoying (esp to anyone who has listened to Klemperer and understood what he was doing), the opening is not well-served by this approach, the arch of the music, especially when we arrive at the horn duets, seems to get lost. However, in the later sections, the seeming exaggeration is what Mahler wrote in the score, the true portamenti are exactly what Mahler wanted, these are often miscalled glissandi, but these swoops in strings and winds are usually downplayed by 21st c conductors. This was part and parcel with the blend of Viennese, Bohemian, and Jewish root music that was in Mahler's mental universe, and they should not be denied. Dudamel wrings every last bit out of the orchestra, and if the pace were little more brisk, this would be the best-realized performance since Walter's. As it is, the playing and recording are so good for a live performance, that I would recommend even with the caveat.",1288656000,5,1306,4.723684210526316

3971457,2,B002R5V7MG,"Gustavo Dudamel - or, as I prefer to call him after watching this concert, Mr Exaggeration - has been hailed as yet another wunderkind of classical music conductors, together with such diverse figures as Daniel Harding and Christian Thielemann. Some people assume that classical music needs such wunderkinds - for instance, young charming guys that like to show off - in order to survive in the contemporary globalized world of kitsch and bad taste. This DVD inaugural LA Philharmonic concert is surely a welcome release for those sceptics.

But when I watched it, I was rather horrified by Mr Exaggeration's behavior at the conductor's rostrum: he looked like some kind of a madman from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (cf.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabinet-of-Dr-Caligari-Restored-Authorized-Edition/dp/B00006JMQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Restored Authorized Edition)</a>) or a scarecrow automaton: insane gestures and grotesque facial expressions. For reference (and antidote), check, e.g., Evgeni Mravinsky's sober conducting style on Youtube.

What about the music, then? Well, I suppose that John Adam's ""City Noir"" is the perfect work for Mr Exaggeration, since it is a very violent work of repeated exaggerations. But I am no fan of Adams or minimalism in general. So I have no real opinion here.

Mahler's first, however, is another case. Mr Exaggeration has already recorded the fifth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B000UNMUFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>), an acceptable but not impressive interpretation. Things are worse here, however. Exaggerations rule - is it really an interpretation (that is, what we usually mean with ""interpretation"") and not just an attempt to show off? Check for instance the second movement, which is virtually torn to pieces by all these extreme exaggerations. Other releases from Mr Exaggeration and DG show that the young conductor also has a developed taste for ""light music"" (see, e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fiesta/dp/B0013USZHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fiesta</a>) or easy showpieces. Perhaps this indicates what kind of conductor Mr Exaggeration actually is. I would not be surprised if he is going to conduct the Vienna New Year concerts in the future.

The LA audience is very pleased, however, apparently spellbound by all the wunderkind exaggerations (it is surely hard to resist that temptation, it's probably like being charmed by children's playing). But I wonder if classical music actually can survive if ""overkill"" is what ""interpretation"" should mean today.

Fortunately, we are not short of outstanding Mahler firsts. Walter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphonies-No-1-No-2-Lieder-eines-fahrenden-Gesellen/dp/B000002A7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphonies No. 1 & No. 2; Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen</a>), Kubelik (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-1/dp/B00004TQUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 1</a>), Ancerl (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancerl-Gold-Edition-6-Mahler-Symphony-no-1-Strauss-Till-Eulenspiegel-s-Merry-Pranks/dp/B00006IZPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancerl Gold Edition 6: Mahler Symphony no. 1/ Strauss - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks</a>), Horenstein (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gustav-Mahler-Symphony-No-1/dp/B000001PBD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 1</a>)...  any of these will highlight the severe shortcomings of Dudamel's mutilated ""interpretation"".

3971458,2,B002R5V7MG,"First, let me say that I admire Gustavo Dudamel's energy and positive attitude towards classical music and his demeanor on the podium and off is always professional. What I can't understand about this performance is his choice in repertoire. I watched this concert when it came on PBS. I do not own the DVD, so I can't comment on the DVD's presentation. I can comment on what I saw and heard that night as I watched this concert, allow me to break it down for you:

1. Performance:

-This is one aspect of this concert that I am not impressed with at all. One major problem is with the repertoire. A John Adams' piece? I mean is this the best they could do? Apparently, this is the premiere of this work titled ""City Noir."" Quite honestly there was nothing about this work that was interesting. It sounded like a terrible emulation of Gerswhin. It is obviously jazz-inspired, but this just doesn't cut it with me. Dudamel's own conducting is far from convincing in this work as well. He seems overly cautious and his attention to the detail and the inner-workings are not well-defined. ""City Noir"" just doesn't add up to much anything. There's nothing for the listener to grab onto. Again, it just sounds like Adams has spent too much time trying to compose something hip and modern without giving much attention to matters of the heart.

The Mahler 1st performance fairs a bit better but not by much. The first movement is terribly sluggish. Again, Dudamel is hesitating. Things start to get a bit more aggressive towards the last two movements as if Dudamel has finally found his own niche in the music. If the first movement was given the proper amount of attention, then it would have been an overall fine performance, but Dudamel clearly doesn't demonstrate that much authority in Mahler yet. I'm not sure if he ever will, but right now I don't hear anything remotely interesting coming from his baton in this work.

2. Audio quality:

-The audio quality is some of the worst I've heard in a modern live performance. It seems rather unfocused and lacks clarity especially in the string section where they almost seem to be drowned out by the other sections, especially brass and percussion.

3. Visual quality/videography:

-I'm impressed with the visual side of this concert. Everything is clear, the brights, and contrasts are just right. The camera work is also nicely done. It seems to focus more on the orchestra than on Dudamel's facial expressions. All orchestral sections are well filmed.

This is a DVD I would not recommend to fans of classical music. The main reason is the performance and the choice of repertoire. In my opinion, Dudamel is most at home in Latin American music. Hopefully, there will be more DVD concerts to come, but I only hope that more attention and consideration is given to the music and the overall performance.",1276473600,10,2852,4.747474747474747
3971459,5,B002R5V7MG,"Mahler, symphony 1

Gustavo Dudamel conducted the Mahler symphony slower than anyone I've heard since Klaus Tennstedt's Chicago performance in 1991.  I don't put great importance on the speed of a performance, but this was slow, almost to the point of worrying me that it would stumble (langsam aber nicht schleppen as Mahler frequently warned).

Then, a bit to my surprise, I started to hear things I had not fixed on in other recordings of Mahler's First:  the slower pace seemed to accentuate the waltz-like (Laendler) aspects, especially in the third movement.

Dudamel's conducting style sometimes reminded me of Bernard Haitink--with a certain degree of ""jerkiness.""  But his enthusiasm, bouncing, and passion for the music was reminiscent of Lenny Bernstein.

It was an enjoyable performance, and I plan to revisit it in the future.

Adams, City Noir

Where the Mahler Titan felt like a slow, at times dancing walk through the forest, City Noir seemed a fast nighttime taxi ride through the city.  There were many passing images, but they were too fleeting to make out what they were.  Sometimes the music sounded like a movie soundtrack (especially ""detective movies"" of the forties and fifties) but without discernable melodies or harmonies, and pursued by a constant feeling of nervousness.

The third movement brought to mind Arthur Honneger's Pacific 231, but Adams' locomotive had trouble moving down the tracks.

Now, for balance it should be remembered that Mahler's music was at first disliked by many critics and audiences simply because it was too different from what they had been accustomed to.  People a century ago simply expected music to behave along the lines of exposition, development, and recapitulation.  Perhaps much as Mahler's music did not ""behave as expected,"" John Adams' music is hard for us to appreciate.  To me, it felt like a nighttime hurried taxi ride through the city, but maybe I'm just not ready for it yet.",1270598400,2,1952,5.091194968553459

While the OPPO combo Blu-ray/SACD/CD/DVD/DVD-Audio player looks interesting I think I'll wait until it can play the new 3D Blu-ray discs. If that means I have to replace my projector, so be it.)

The other works on this Dudamel disc are interesting but not nearly as powerful as the Mahler. Dudamel treats his body as another instrument for our enjoyment. Five stars . . . or is that five Yums!",1270080000,2,673,4.703389830508475

I am disappointed! Mr. Dudamel seems to have learnt all the theatrical elements
and gestures of Leonard Bernstein, but without holding the musical elements in shape or presenting the musical arguments
in a coherent manner. Bits and pieces, they may sound exciting and may at times shock and awe. Unfortunately,
the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. If this is what real Mahler would sound like, I would have abandoned
Mahler years ago. The most shame of it all is that the sound of the orchestra was excellent but the conductor
was not able to mold it into a convincing whole.
(One of my favorite versions is Rafael Kubelik's on DGG.) I am afraid this
young conductor is not an isolated case on the American classical music scene and this interpretation is typically what
the public is exposed to or listen to.",1266969600,3,940,4.634730538922156
3971462,3,B002R5V7MG,"The Mahler performance is good.  But will it be so good twenty years from now?  Is this really a version that can supplant Kubelik, or, God forbid, Bruno Walter?  Frankly, I thought there were moments that were somewhat shallow, where key details were buried beneath the romantic flow.  And the sound is stunningly lacking in nuance.

As for the L.A. Philharmonic, they sounded infinitely better when Maazel conducted them in Sibelius 2nd in January.  On this Mahler DG live recording the strings sound thin.  Fault of the recording?  I don't know.

I'm a subscriber to the L.A.  I've been knocked out by Dudamel a few times already.  I expect great things.  But let's not lose our reason over this.

As for the opening piece...the finest moments reminded me what a remarkable film composer Jerry Goldsmith was (especially in his score for ""Chinatown).  I just don't know why John Adams thinks he should be the guy to remind us that.",1265068800,7,933,4.786163522012578
3971463,5,B002R5V7MG,"When Mahler's Symphony #1 was first performed in Budapest in 1889, you can be sure that there was controversy. The slow introduction to the first movement is interrupted by military fanfares and cuckoo calls. The Fahrenden Gesellen walking tune next is interrupted by trumpet fanfares. In the third movement Death the annihilator enters with a sinister funeral march based on the nursery tune Frere Jacques. In the finale we hear the cry of a wounded heart.
Now, 130 years later, this all sounds  like normal run of the mill Mahler to us. But a new composition by John Adams,which is well in the mainstream of New American Music championed by Philip Glass and Steve Reich, seems radical and risky to us. As noted in the program notes, jazz influenced classical music began with Darius Milhaud's La Creation du monde, Saudades do Brasil and Le boeuf sur le toit in the 1920s, followed by Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.
Come on folks, give the guy a break! Check out Milhaud, Glass and Reich and give Adams another listen. This isn't Cage or Stockhausen, it's good old red, white and blue patriotic American music.",1265068800,,1110,4.81151832460733
3971464,4,B002R5V7MG,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD because of the inclusion of a very modern work by John Adams so-called City Noir. Although this would be a suitable noise for a background of a horror film perhaps since it contained absolutely no melody or tune I consider that it was most unsuitable for this concert. A work by Leonard Bernstein  would have  been more appropriate ,The Symphony number one by Mahler was magnificent on the contrary and I enjoyed this enormously. Both the quality of the sound and picture was beyond reproach. Thus I feel rather shortchanged as far as I was concerned. Gustavo has great panache and it is a most exciting conductor",1264032000,3,655,4.7368421052631575
3971465,4,B002R5V7MG,"This is rated 5 for performance, 3 for sound.

All in all, this is a terrfic interpretation of the Mahler 1st, lushly and thrillingly played by the LA Phil, which is long overdue its deserved recognition.

However, DG seems intent on bringing us Maestro Dudamel largely through the medium of recorded live performances.  While that does cut the budget nicely, it can result in less than ideal quality of sound, which is the case here. On the positive side, the engineers turn up the volume during the quiet and slow sections, letting us hear details that are missing in typical symphonic recordings.  And the excessive reverberation provides a wonderfully warm patina over the entire performance.

On the negative side, the reverb is way overdone. Brasses have an ""otherwordly"" sound to them like something out of Hearts of Space. Lower frequencies are reproduced not as the musical sound of drums and bass fiddles, but as some sort of generic rumble,like the sound of a passing subway train or railroad car.

Much of the excitement that Maestro Dudamel is so clearly trying to establish is blunted by the tendency of the engineers to turn the volume way down during the louder and faster sections, particularly at the end of the first movement.  In the video we see the conductor clearly signal ""forte"" (louder) and we see the musicians digging in.  However, the sound on the recording actually gets quieter at that point. It is hoped that DG will provide better sound quality for the remaining recordings in Maestro Dudamel's Mahler cycle.

If you are a Dudamel fan, this DVD provides a solid momento of an auspicious occassion. However, it does not replace Bernstein (Sony) or Walter (Sony) or Leinsdorf (London Phase 4 LP) as my favorite recordings of Mahler's magnificent symphony.",1263254400,4,1786,4.946488294314381
3971466,5,B002R5V7MG,"For those of us who have watched and listened to the magical rise of the young intensely musical Gustavo Dudamel from his first appearances in this country, and were fortunate enough to be present during his inaugural concerts as Music Director and Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic as well as his subsequent 2009 autumn concerts, this DVD of the young gentle giant in performance is a particular treasure. And while it is one thing to be present in the hall when Dudamel is conducting live, when the electricity and magnetism of his talent is so obvious, this memento is a very fine way to share his gifts. As with all recorded live performances, there are times when close-ups of the various orchestra players disrupt the flow and intensity of the music, but DGG has done a fine job with the acoustics and with the quality of photography, and they have given a generous amount of time to focusing on Dudamel as he shapes and molds and indulges in the music at hand.

John Adams' 'City Noir' was commissioned for this occasion and Dudamel brings this rather thickly orchestrated work to life. More about that later. But the joy of the DVD is the brilliance of the performance of the Mahler First Symphony. Dudamel already channels Mahler like few other conductors, relishing the changing rhythms and tune variations in a manner that seems as though Mahler himself might be on the podium. He shapes the entire symphony with a finely tuned unified focus, allowing the symphony to unfold with every idiosyncrasy that makes Mahler so wondrous. His tempi are flexible, his pausing for phrases to develop is fascinating, and his physical communication with his orchestra is magically infectious.  There will always be those who say that no conductor can equal the old recorded performances by the past masters like Bruno Walter etc., but that is the type of response does not allow for the fact that Mahler is Mahler and when he is as fresh today under the baton of someone as musical as Gustavo Dudamel as he was over a hundred years ago, then it may be time to put away old prejudices and re-open the heart to the immediacy of music making.

One aspect of Dudamel's new position with the Los Angeles Philharmonic that has endeared him to the orchestra and audiences alike is his selfless approach to the music which he demonstrates by forsaking the personal bows and instead, walking into the orchestra members to thank them and laud their performance.  Dudamel is a source of joy and a gift to the world of classical music.  This DVD captures that.  Grady Harp, January 10",1262304000,,2578,4.756152125279642
3971467,4,B002R5V7MG,"The inaugural gala of Los Angeles Philharmonic on October 9, 2009 conducted by our young conductor and legitimate pride for the music that really need to be enlivened, could not be more successful. Because and far beyond I would just to make two simple observations respect the execution, it would be unfair to ignore the emotion that impregnated the Walt Disney Hall will be reminded during years to come. The interpretation of the first work John Adams' ""City Noir"", was  a real tour de force for most the instruments of the Orchestra. Excel phrasing, articulation, color and rotund balance made of this execution a superb entry for the main dish.

Mahler's First Symphony was performed with radiant vitality and several formal liberties. The result would have been perfect if not (to my mind) two details of execution and approach.

The first movement was conducted with a very clear slow tempo. Such conception made the dramatic tension of the coda experienced a visible lack of intensity, due the expected fluidity that led to the climax didn't reach the top. On the other hand in the second movement the oboes and clarinets brightened by their absence and didn't make feel themselves, being shadowed by metals and strings.

Our distinguished conductor likes to perform this Symphony. And we really hope and wish that the next year he gets to achieve a renowned status among the well renowned conductors in Mahler, due we will commemorate the 150th anniversary's eve year of Mahler's birth. So, I guess that probably we will have at short term, the integral symphonies in live or studio recordings not only by this notable orchestra.

Kudos for Gustavo and the success accompanies you for a long, long time.",1262217600,2,1712,4.951219512195122
3971468,5,B002R5V7MG,"I was at Disney Hall in October 2009 to see Gustavo Dudamel conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic in one of their four performances of Mahler's symphony 1.  My impression then was that Gustavo had passed the Mahler test with flying colors.  I love Mahler's 10 symphonies, and I've heard numerous performances of each over the years.  The Los Angeles Philharmonic led by Dudamel gives us a thrilling Mahler 1st, and it's perfectly captured on DVD.  For those who watched this performance on PBS, you really haven't heard it yet; Deutsche Grammophon has done a masterful job of approximating the dynamic range of Disney Hall's magnificient acoustic, and the performance is even better than I remember.  Disney Hall looks and sounds absolutely beautiful here.  I'm glad that this concert began with the world premiere of John Adams' City Noir, because the legacy of the L.A. Philharmonic's previous director Esa-Pekka Salonen, is that worthy new works by living composers deserve to be on the program with great works from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  That's standard practice at Disney Hall.",1261180800,14,1095,5.083798882681564
3971469,4,B002R5V7MG,"I don't mean to sound a cautionary note here, but Esa-Pekka Salonen wasn't exactly chopped liver either. Like Dudamel, he excels at music that is highly rhythmic and colorful. He also recorded a very fine Mahler 3rd symphony for Sony Classical, and that was without the benefit of either Royce Hall (UCLA) or Disney Hall. Instead, it was recorded in the rather dry acoustics of Dorothy Chandler. His other two Mahler recordings - Mahler 4 and ""Das Lied von der Erde"" - weren't quite up to that same level, but they were decent enough. He's also one heck of a good composer. In fact, I must say that I enjoy Salonen's own orchestral works more than the newly commissioned work that opens this concert: John Adam's ""City Noir"".

""City Noir"" is a decent enough work - one that plays up to the strengths of the L.A. Phil. (who are nearly unrivaled in the execution of modern works). But it easily could have been chopped down to just its best movement, which was the third and final one. Like so many contemporary composers, Adams is a marvelous orchestrator, but truly lacks any kind of melodic profile. It's easy for tedium to set in, simply because there are so few reference points along the way (or musical buoy markers). It's for that reason that I recommend just doing the third movement in future performances (it would make a great, short opener before doing other works that are highly rhythmic, and also use tons of percussion).

The Mahler 1st is a solid enough performance too, but I really prefer another DVD of it: the one on Euroarts, with Fabio Luisi leading the wonderful Staatskapelle Dresden. To me, it sounds as though Dudamel has lived with the Mahler a bit too long, and loves this piece perhaps just a bit too much for its own good. I would like to have heard a bit more ""freshness"", and more willingness to the let the music speak for itself.

For example, I can't say that Dudamel's lumbering tempo for the first movement's main melody - borrowed from Mahler's own ""Ging heute morgen ubers feld"" (the first of the ""Songs Of A Wayfahrer"") - is somehow an improvement over what we normally hear. It forces him to make a massive speed-up at the end of each of those two sections (assuming that one is doing the exposition repeat). Thus, it sounds a tad contrived. The same holds true for the start of the scherzo.

I appreciate that Mr. Dudamel is willing to take the scherzo at a heavier, more lumbering gait. But do we really need him to start ultra-slow, then speed up, each and every time the scherzo starts over? Making that effect just the very first time, would have gotten his point across perfectly fine. Also, it's here in the scherzo that Dudamel's biggest interpretive ""tick"" comes to the surface: his constant slashing at every accent and big downbeat that rolls his way. It sounds over done. In that sense, he reminds me a bit of Solti and Bernstein, which may to be some people's liking (and I do like those two conductors, but for numerous other reasons).

Fortunately, things go more smoothly - less interpretive distractions, shall we say - in the final two movements. That stated, the final chords of the symphony certainly could have used more from the ongoing bass drum roll supporting everything from underneath. Where was it?

Still, this is an auspicious start to a new partnership that's dangerously bordering on being over-hyped by the media, and everyone else. Let's give the Dudamel/L.A. ""thang"" a bit more time to season. Meanwhile, let's not forget the solid contributions that Salonen made to this great institution, not least of which was the ""pushing"" for Disney Hall itself. If you're in this for the Mahler, I'd say stick to other tried-and-true, classic renditions. On DVD, I really like the Luisi/Dresden one (Euroarts, I think). Luisi displays more willingness to let Mahler's music speak for itself, combined with a more ""rustic"" sound quality from the Dresden orchestra.",1261094400,8,3929,4.745241581259151

8378372,5,B002R5V7MG,"I bought this disk because of it was Mahler and because it was Dudamel.

However, about Deutsche Gramo Phone: the recording is very poor when it comes to sound. Further, it was even poorer when it comes to the views: it gives no sense of you being in the scenes, as part of the Orchestra, as it is in  better recordings as it is in the recordings of the last concerts of maestro Abbado, who teached  Dudamel. I was utterly disappointed at Deutsche.

Deutsche: You'd better watch out!

Dudamel: you may be In the wrong hands, as Claudio Arrau was.

I like Abbado's interpretation way better than that of Dudamel's: it is ""rounded"" rather than ""angular"" as in Dudamel. Yet, I absolutely love Dudamel and his energy in conducting. He is in a class of himself and he will surely go down in history as one of the extraordinary conductors to come around in many years.

There seems to be two ways to get a good performing orchestra (let's remember that Mahler called the ""rubble"" of the players in an orchestra, which is so common today in the best orchestras of the world; they are just rubble. (I learned at an early age in the Conservatory, where I studied violin, that most people who can play an instrument well, do not have the artistic ability; they become orchestra players; very but very few have the ability to play an instrument and ""interpret"" a composer):  Dudamel's way, which is absolute energy (an ""animal conductor"" as a critic said) and the other seems to be the ""deep understanding and relationship to the musicians"" as Abbado seems to have.

Whatever you like, I would recommend both recordings. The Abbado may go down in history as one of the best performances ever. On the other hand, Dudamel, a young conductor today, may sell this disk for many years to come at least as a historical  young recording. You may want to buy both.",1392940800,,1845,4.580547112462006
