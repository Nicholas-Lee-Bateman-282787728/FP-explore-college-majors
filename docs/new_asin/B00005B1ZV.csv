7936259,3,B00005B1ZV,"Though it's too early to assume that Don Wilson won't make another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;movie, I'm pleased that his most recent contribution to the series is one of the better ones. Though still suffering from problems that continually plagued his films in general, ""Trained to Kill"" is a decent action outing with much more going for it than the last several additions to the franchise. Not being a Wilson fan in general, it may not mean a lot coming from me, but by and large, I don't think this one's awful for a change.

The story: the past life of ex-CIA agent Rick Cowan (Wilson) catches up with him when an international hit squad targets him and his son (John White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-J-s-Time-Travelers/dp/B00002E20U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.J.'s Time Travelers</a>). Fleeing to Ireland, they will find reason to consider their limited allies carefully and call upon all their talents in order to survive the ordeal.

After seeing so many of Wilson's films settling for the mundane, the handful of highlights from this one's production stands out as particularly pleasing to me. For one thing, there are finally some memorable dramatic performances to be seen: ally Jillian McWhirter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Progeny/dp/6305300739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Progeny</a>) and evil CIA character Warren Burton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Lantern/dp/B004EPZ07K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Lantern</a>) do fine enough, but Irish performers Richard Farrell and John McHugh are genuinely fun to watch peform. Maybe I'm only saying this because I'm a fan of the Irish accent, but this officially marked the first time I was impressed by ""Bloodfist"" cast members for their acting. Likewise, this also marks the first time I took note of the soundtrack in a Don Wilson flick: after so many monotonous scores, the blues guitar and bagpipes are a welcome change. Also, while John White isn't among the better actors in the movie, I was pleased that a quirk of his character which is displayed early on - his ability to build harmful devices, such as electrocuting stereos and marker-sized bombs that can make a man explode entirely - returns to be integral to the climax later on. In regular movies, these things are nothing to crow about, but in DTV flicks, it's seriously advanced filmmaking.

Even the fight scenes are a step above the average for Don Wilson...but don't get your hopes up too high for this one. Appealingly, the seven fistfights feature a lot less slow motion than many of Don's brawls, and a general faster pace makes them stand out further. The choreography by co-star Donnie Hair (who's a genuine martial arts hero for having thwarted the mugging of an old lady alongside Wilson) features lots of high kicks and roundhouses, but it's rendered a bit useless by that old sin of claustrophobic camerawork. But for once, I don't mind this too much: while better brawls would have conceivably pushed this one up into the four-star range, the story and some of the character interactions are interesting enough to keep me entertained; so while disappointing, the poor fights aren't the death knell for a martial arts movie like they'd usually be.

Had I run into this film earlier in my quest of watching the entire Don Wilson library, I may have assumed that I had more to look forward to, but as this one ranks in my personal top five list of the Dragon's vehicles, I'm going to assume it was but a momentary ascent from the average. Committed Wilson fans, of course, may find it a lot better, and newcomers may as well use this to introduce themselves to the man, but I don't consider it worth a purchase...but definitely worth 85 minutes on the couch if you happen to catch it on TV.",1360540800,,3989,5.49185667752443
7936260,4,B00005B1ZV,"For a low budget direct-to-video action flick, this doesn't come off to bad. It stars real like Kickboxing champion Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson as an ex-CIA agent who's past back to haunt him when he and his son are targeted for murder. Some decent plot twists and Don's sub par acting is still likeable. I was actually surprised to see this film retitled as part of the Bloodfist series as I originally saw it on video as just Hard Way Out. That's ok that it was retitled Bloodfist VIII: Hard Way Out as it makes my Bloodfist collection that much longer.",1103328000,,551,4.465346534653466
