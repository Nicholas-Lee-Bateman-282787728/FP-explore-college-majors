His childlike nature and incredible wisdom are impressive and very touching.  Then there are generous shots of him playing which are incredible.  Also wonderful are the insights of his equally amazing wife Gillian.  This is a story that one wouldn't believe if it were fiction.  This is a film that touches the head, the heart and the spirit.  I highly recommend it.",1479945600,,508,4.588888888888889
