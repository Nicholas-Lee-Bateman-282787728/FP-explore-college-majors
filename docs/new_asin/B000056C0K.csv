1396671,5,B000056C0K,"It's terrific to have the Ian Carmichael series of Lord Peter Wimsey novels available on DVD, and I hope the rest of the original series will soon follow those now up.  This one is excellent entertainment, and I have no criticism of the adaptation or the acting or the production.  My only negative comment is that it would have made the DVD release more friendly if the episodes had been edited together, with credits shown only at the beginning and end of each disc.  It's a nuisance to have to navigate around this stuff.  The producers of the best ""Pride and Prejudice"" did this to greatly improved presentation in its most recent release.  I hope the Wimsey releases from Acorn will do it in the future.",1011657600,5,708,4.587301587301587
1396672,4,B000056C0K,"Having recently become enamored with the Lord Peter Wimsey books by Dorothy L. Sayers, I started noticing the Acorn Media television adaptations lining the local bookshelves, and decided to purchase one. I picked the ""Five Red Herring"", as it was the book which had been the most fun to read.
  I was not disappointed with the adaptation.
  The ""Five Red Herrings"" is an enjoyable, yet complex story, set in Scotland during a holiday of Wimsey and his man, Bunter. A painter with nearly no friends and mostly nothing but enemies is found by the two holiday-seekers at the foot of a stream, and their enquiries into his death begin.
  While the novel delved deeply into the five other painters populating the area (the five red herrings, as it were), scoping out their movements and establishing (or crumbling) their alibis, the adaptation trims things down a bit, and makes the story much more crisp and tight. While the book used flashbacks at times, in order to relay certain events, the television version moves everything along in linear time, making it much more easy to follow (I often find too many flashbacks jarring to the flow of a storyline). The plot is revealed in four parts, making for convenient viewing, and the end of one part is especially harrowing.
  The portrayal of Wimsey by Ian Carmichael is superb. He manages to balance Wimsey's jovial nature with the realization that there is a cunning and highly superior mind at work. In many ways it is reminiscent of Patrick Macnee's John Steed character - often outwardly foppish and foolish, whilst all the time keen and aware. The actor who portrays Bunter (the other lead role) does a very good job, as well, showcasing the servant side while also betraying the very evident hint of insightful talent which can sometimes prove invaluable.
  The other actors in this production all do a great job, hitting exactly the right notes with each of their characters. The setting used is very nice, with rolling hills and streams and little cottages. Wimsey's vintage car adds yet more to evoking the 1930's mystique. The sets are cozy and convincing, and it is quite obvious that everyone involved with the production had nothing but straightforward respect for the material. True, some things from the book are trimmed-down or left out, but in many ways that makes the adaption work better. Novels are novels, and television is television.
  Luckily, in the case of the ""Five Red Herrings"", we have wonderful examples of both.",990316800,13,2490,4.888361045130641
1396673,5,B000056C0K,"I was delighted to see Acorn Media re-release Five Red Herrings.  This is one of the best British mysteries ever by the greatest British mystery writer ever (in my opinion).  While the DVD version is excellent, the print quality, as other reviewers have said, is not the greatest. BBC, in the mid 70s, used videotape for a lot of their productions instead of film with the result the picture quality suffered.  But, this is a small point.  The Wimsey series, first broadcast between 1974-77 in America and Canada on PBS Masterpiece Theatre, has been too long unavailable. Ian Carmichael is a perfect Wimsey and the Scottish countryside around Kirkcudbright makes this period piece a real charmer.
  In most of Sayers novels, the villain rarely gets served up justice by the police as he/she/they do in Agatha Christie.  Five Red Herrings is an exception, but suicide or some tragic cicumstance usually settles the score as it does in the other three released Wimsey series (to date).  Not the hangman's noose for Dorothy's villains.  Wimsey is a remarkable creation, very similar to Wodehouse's Wooster, but Sayers put Wimsey (and Bunter) through the hell of the Great War with the result there is a deeper side to the appearance of the ""foppish Lord Peter"". Five Red Herrings is a finely crafted story brought to the screen to perfection in this DVD
Top marks to Amazon and Acorn and I hope the creme de la creme of the 5 productions, The Nine Tailors, is soon to be released.  The Nine Tailors is Sayers' finest work and, I think, the finest mystery novel ever written.  The BBC production is outstanding and of five star quality.  My recommendation to fellow viewers is to ask Amazon to complete the set and if you think the videos/DVDs are great, the novels are even better.  Sayers was a classical scholar of international reputation who translated Dante's Inferno (still in print) and one of the finest writers of the early 20th century and nowhere is this talent better illustrated in The Nine Tailors and the other novels represented by this outstanding BBC series.  ""I say, well done Bunter!!""",985996800,28,2102,4.835195530726257
1396674,4,B000056C0K,"THE FIVE RED HERRINGS by Dorothy Sayers is ""must"" reading for mystery lovers. In her 1920s novels about the exploits of Lord Peter Wimsey, Sayers devised many plot elements contained in mystery tales written afterword. HERRINGS is no exception. In fact, one of the plot elements in HERRINGS was used recently in the opening episode of HEAT OF THE SUN the BBC drama set in Kenya. I read HERRINGS before I saw the BBC dramatization and you may want to do so too. This is a complicated plot with six suspects, five of whom are red herrings.
Each of Sayers tales is fresh and original, and I am amazed after all this time that her stories still retain a sense of newness. Of course for Anglophiles, the BBC dramas based on Sayers tales also retain a sense of the ""good old days"" beteen the wars before Britain became so Americanized (drugs, crimes etc.)--or is it the other way round??
But British murderers are generally genteel. While Americans whack peole and dump their bodies at sea (first puncture the lungs so the body doesn't float says Grandma Mazur in TWO FOR THE DOUGH). But the British murderers in Sayers tales stage phoney accidents that involve a palette knife and a tumble down a bank (supposedly the artist stepped back to admire his handywork). And best of all, British murderers are talented. They can duplicate other artists works and baffle the police.
I am really pleased ACORN Media put THE FIVE RED HERRINGS on DVD. I've bought the other Wimsey tales on VHS tape and I know the DVD will last longer.  Unfortunately, the transfer copy used for this process was not the best. I realize it would have cost a bit more to make this a ""Criterion 'Lady Vanishes'"" -- with which it has much in common-- but I sure wish had been feasible.  The plot is clever and original, the acting superb, and the backgrounds and settings are filled with verismilitude.  Unfortunately, the outdoor scenes are a bit faded--the light you know.  Otherwise HERRINGS is a work of art. I'd still buy it flaws and all.",983750400,7,2008,4.632022471910112
1396675,5,B000056C0K,Lord Peter Wimsey and his faithful manservant Bunter travel to Scotland for a holiday.  On a fishing outing they discover a dead artist who appears to have fallen to his death.  Lord Peter suspects foul play and helps the local police sort through clues in a baffling case.  The attention to detail in this fine mystery is superb as is the acting.  Ian Carmichael is the perfect choice to play Lord Peter.  In the DVD version we have a chance to listen to him discuss the making of the Lord Peter mysteries as part of the extra features offered to the viewer.,981504000,9,559,4.4411764705882355
1396676,5,B000056C0K,"The fourth of five entries in the Acorn Media releases of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, <Five Red Herrings> takes us out of the mostly claustrophobic sets of the other three and into the Highlands of Scotland where Lord Peter (Ian Carmichael) and the Jeevesian Bunter (Glyn Houston) are out, respectively, for a holiday of fishing and painting. But their chances of not running up against a murder are as small as those of Jessica Fletcher or Miss Marple, and the two are forced into a busman's holiday when the Meanest Man in Town, Sandy Campbell (Ian Ireland) is found dead in a stream many feet below the place where his still-wet painting stands on an easel.
  The absence of a tube of Flake White prompts Wimsey into suspecting foul play, and we are all launched into what he himself describes as a Wilkie Collins plot. In fact, as other reviewers have pointed out, this plot is not quite as satisfactory as the three that preceded: ""Clouds of Witness,"" ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,"" and ""Murder Must Advertise."" There are six suspects--one murderer and five red herrings--all of whom were someplace else at the time of the murder; and even on my fifth viewing, I found myself confused as to which name matched which actor.
  As always in this series, the acting in general is superior. Here we have standout performances from John Junkin as Bunter's fellow butler and Susan Macready as Gilda Farren, the somewhat too-perfect wife of one of the suspects.
  The long shots of the Scottish scenery alone are worth the price of the video. But it is Carmichael's Wimsey that keeps us fascinated. Far less comical than David Suchet's Poirot, his Wimsey can quote Shakespeare along with Rumpole of the Bailey at his best and yet can become deadly serious in an eye-blink. Also those who are interested in how the smallest role can steal a scene, watch the young girl who witnessed a fight between the victim and one of the suspects as she laconically gives evidence.
  So for an only slightly overcomplicated whodunit with superb acting and production values (despite a low budget), you will want to add this set to the three already released by Acorn Media.",979084800,13,2172,4.773333333333333

1396678,5,B000056C0K,I have always thought it the best Lord Peter Wimsey story. Well written story which was also well acted by the entire cast. There's a use of irony and humor all through this mystery which I always appreciated. Dorthy Sayers wrote a truly fine novel and I thought it even better than the TV production. Nevertheless Ian Carmichael and the other members of the cast put on such a fine performance that it was easy to overlook the omissions from the novel in the TV transcript. In addition the story was well suited for TV. It also is better when you view it all at once rather than in parts. It's also a story that you can read or view on numerous occasions.,1317600000,,656,4.341463414634147
1396679,5,B000056C0K,"Charm is, as always, the hallmark of Ian Carmichael's (1920-2009) Lord Peter Wimsey, but absent, for the most part, is the veneer of foolishness with which he masks the cold-blooded rationality with which he tracks down murderers.  Whatever may be the informality and democratic tolerance with which he engages his social inferiors (in the Great Britain in which the Sayers character operates) he never loses that rigid code of conduct which demands that the King's Justice be done at any cost. While strikingly different in many respects from John Buchan's Richard Hannay, he is similar in that he is always in the service of God, King and Country.
at any rate, in Five Red Herrings, he is vacationing in Scotland with his man, Bunter, when, by chance he stumbles upon an artist dead from an accident. An accident? Not once Sir Peter takes a good look at the scene. From there Sir Peter and the local police, with Bunter making invaluable contributions, are on the hunt for a killer. Prime suspects are the victim's fellow artists in this colony of same; being a terrible obnoxious person, the victim has seriously offended each of his fellow in the neighborhood. Rather more richly than is customary, a bevy of idiosyncratic people is there to help Lord Peter into enlightenment and confusion.
All in all, an entertaining entry in this Ian Carmichael starred 1973-74 series, a most winning star, excellent featured performers, and, as is the usual thing in BBC mysteries, more than competent supporting players. You should enjoy this mystery .",1271116800,,1545,4.9652509652509655

1396681,5,B000056C0K,"Dorothy Sayers wrote Five Red Herrings to satisfy the desires of her Scottish friends that she set one of her detective stories in Scotland. Thirty years after filming, Ian Carmichael is still incomparable as Lord Peter Wimsey, and the cast provides excellent support. Sayers did her usual fine job with the story, but, critics agree, it is the weakest of her detective novels. Still, she was one of the finest writers of the 20th century, and the only writer of detective stories to get a mention in Jacques Barzun's Five Hundred Years of Western Civilization!",1221436800,,561,4.91578947368421

1396683,4,B000056C0K,Five Red Herrings was good but English was difficult to understand a fair amount of time.  Liked the part of Lord Peter Wimsey.,1193443200,,127,4.521739130434782
1396684,1,B000056C0K,I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the DVD - it was a copy of a copy of a copy - grainy and in black and white. I wouldn't have cared except I played the part of Gilda in the series and wanted my grand children to see what their granny looked like at 25 years! The series I might add was made up in Scotland in full colour. I will nver buy from Amazon again.,1184630400,,370,3.8181818181818183
1396685,4,B000056C0K,"The most entertaining mysteries for me are those in which the reader or viewer doesn't take the detective completely seriously.  I guess I'll admit that Jeremy Brett's Holmes is an exception to that rule, but it usually holds.  I love the slightly off kilter Poirot, Marple and this detective, Lord Peter Wimsey.  Loved the books, loved the shows on PBS in the 70's, of which this is one.  Ian Carmichael is perfect as the aristocrat who sometimes seems like he couldn't tie his shoe without his valet, Bunter, and sometimes is most ably galloping across the countryside in pursuit of a clue or the criminal.  Wimsey is a man who expects to be served and respected but also serves, namely the cause of justice.  In this mystery he has six suspects and manages to figure out the amazingly convoluted way in which the killing was committed.  I felt the recreation of the crime by Wimsey was a little long-winded and that is the reason why I did not rate this video a 5.  The supporting cast are wonderful. The town where the death takes place is replete with the usual variety of eccentric folk that always turn up in these ""wimsical"" mysteries.  Longer and not as gripping as the Brett Holmes dramas, a Wimsey video is a nice way to fill a leisurely afternoon.",1045440000,4,1259,4.584821428571429
1396686,4,B000056C0K,"Having read the Dorothy L. Sayers books after seeing this series, it is impossible to imagine anyone but Ian Carmichael playing Lord Peter Wimsey.
The production values may not have been the BBC's best, but the characterisations are spot on. Sayer's plots may not be as involving as Agatha Christie's but her development of the cast raise her novels to a much higher level, and this is captured very well in 'The Five Red Herrings'.
 Sayer's characters need time to 'breathe', unlike Christie's more shallow creations, and this 'series' gives us the luxury to see Lord Peter and the wonderful Bunter, unravel the crime at a leisurely pace.
Not for the 'video generation' for sure, but for those who like
their classic murder mystery done in the classic English fashion, this VCD is a must.
The bonus of Ian Carmichael's thoughts on the series is a wonderful bonus",1011916800,4,863,4.831081081081081
7931758,3,B000056C0K,"So the first thing that you need to know is that this is a 1970's video....and British, so the quality it kinda washed out and the story moves thoughtfully ( slow). If you can stand both those things & don't have a problem understanding British ,Scottish or Irish accents then it's possible that you will enjoy this. Having watched the All creatures great & small series, we found this a pleasant mystery (albeit quiet long).
I have seen the new Lord Wimsey & it's fine too, but the two actors are vastly different & bring a much different flavor to the character. I have never read any of Sayer's books, so I cannot attest to the accuracy of the adaptation.",1507075200,,658,4.491666666666666
7931759,5,B000056C0K,"Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series sort of though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter that can now be found on DVD . So I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Now it is time to go through the whole series.

Now I watched the one I missed on PBS. The first thing I notices was that Ian Carmichael talks much faster than Petherbridge. And all the people seem older. Of course Peter was supposed to be older when he met Harriet.

Campbell a local artist is being obnoxious and makes everybody's life miserable. Let's face it Campbell needs killing. You guessed it; he seems to have had an accident while painting. Lord Peter deduces that the so called accident could only be staged by another painter. Yep there are six suspects and more if it is not a painter. So that leaves ""Five Red Herrings""

As with all Sayers' stories nothing is simple there are overlapping plots and foolish deeds, as if Peter can not figure them out. On the side we learn a little about Scottish society and see the landscape.

They took the time to put just about everything relevant from the book in to this production. There were a few exceptions but not worth bothering about. The production is complete enough that you do not have to read the book. Yet you will want to for the differences and more dialogs.

I am glad they finally made a DVD version. However the one I watched was the tape. This item is worth purchasing as you will want to replay it often.",1503187200,,1636,4.45819397993311
