7307296,1,B010CG2DW4,"I really don't understand why this movie is so highly rated -- probably because all of the cast -- and there are a lot of them -- wrote reviews on imdb and Amazon.
In short, the dialogue is trite with most of the jokes seeming as though they were written by a (not funny) teenage boy, the acting is bad, and the plotline is dumb with lots of stupid plot devices.  I feel like my daily life is funnier than this, and that is saying a lot.",1452643200,3,437,4.022988505747127

7307304,5,B010CG2DW4,"This movie fuggin rocks. Saw it a buncha times on the festival circuit and I gotta say, 5/5 stars. Great writing, great performances, great music, great cinematography, great writing, great locations, great people, great burgers, great service, great prices, the bathrooms were nice and clean, our server was really friendly and allowed us to make substitutions for my dietary restrictions. That means a lot for someone who is essentially allergic to evreything. Dining in general is very difficult when you can't have shellfish, raw fruit, most grains, non-plant protein, dairy, nuts, or costal sands. My entree was fabulous, my partners was even better. I tipped 50%. That's how good it was. I can't wait to return when I'm back in town. And I had a great BM afterward. I highly recommend this movie.",1447804800,7,802,5.037593984962406
