Additionally, I renewed my Prime based on rumors that Prime would allow movoes played on android devices like my Samsung Tab 2.  So far, Iam disappointed.  No good reason to restrict streaming movies.  Prime HAS to be losing market share by disallowing android devices.",1412553600,,414,4.76056338028169
