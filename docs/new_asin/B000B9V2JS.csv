2409442,5,B000B9V2JS,"The Village People were a fun group with light-hearted music, who put on a showy, out-of-this-world concert.  This brings back their music, and my own memories of them in concert, a spectacle I was fortunate enough to get to see. This DVD puts me in a happy mood & reminds me not only of The Village People in concert, but also of *all* the fans who ""dressed up."" That was as much a part of the ""show"" as anything. Many of the concert goers would dress up, either as their fav band member or in a costume of their own design. It reminds me of carefree, happier days with the people - the fans - dancing any- & everywhere. One of more interesting places to see costumes was the Ladies' Room(s) at the concert venue, as well as the adjacent section of hallway. It seemed like all the girls, & young women my age (23 at the time) who had dressed up were in there primping. This being Seattle, there were loads of guys dressed up as well, and likewise a ""show"" of costumes to be seen in the hallway outside of the Mens' Room(s)!
So, this takes me back to my youth when life was crazy & fun, and away for a bit, from heavy grown-up things like the economy, memories of 9/11 & terrorists.
This is a great ""fun-fix"" for any fan of the group. Slip in the DVD & let it take you back to your youth!",1369958400,5,1288,4.152

2409445,5,B000B9V2JS,"If you like the Village People I think you'll love this.  It contains standard videos along with concert footage.
The music's great and the videos (whether standard like ""In the Navy""), or concert footage (like ""Fire Island"") are really fun to watch.  It's great fun.  Village People fans won't be disappointed.",1271203200,5,311,5.0588235294117645

8083939,4,B000B9V2JS,"A good compilation of the Village People in action, with all their infectious music and dance routines. Some reviewers mention the audio quality, and some clips are proportioned for old TV rather than big screen, but I'm glad I got this...the audio is not troubling, and the difference in some of the clips' quality does not make this a subpar deal. There's  not a lot of the Village People stuff out there to enjoy, so this fits the bill nicely...brings a smile to my face as it takes me back in time as I watch the choreography that launched a hundred weight loss DVDs. Well worth it.",1482796800,,586,4.4766355140186915

8083946,5,B000B9V2JS,"What a fun ride! Not only do you get the promo videos for well known hits such as ""Go West"" and ""In the Navy,"" the rarely seen long version of ""Macho Man"" is here in its entirety as well! Other gems that aren't often seen, such as ""Ready for the 80's"" and ""Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody"" are here in all their glory as well. The videos from their ""New Romantic"" phase are here, as well as the delicious ""Sex Over the Phone"" clip. That one gets a bad rap sometimes, but it's hilarious fun, the guys are looking sexy, and the song gets stuck in your head for days!

For songs that don't have a video, live clips were used. A few examples would be ""Can't Stop the Music"" and ""Magic Night."" The sound on these live clips isn't great, but it's nice to have them here! They're certainly watchable and audible, so don't be dissuaded! If you enjoy those clips, the entire concert is available on the ""Live in Japan"" DVD, which is available as an import from Marketplace sellers right here on Amazon.

I only have one niggle, and it's a small one I suppose. Only part of the original clip of YMCA is included, tacked on (seamlessly, though, which is great) after the live performance that closes the disc. HOWEVER (don't despair!) the 1993 remix (and it's accompanying video) of YMCA opens the disc and is a real stomper! It's very true to the original sound, just cranked up a notch. The video is fun, and uses clips of several VP videos. So, even if you're a YMCA fanatic, our boys have taken care of you with this DVD!

Sound and video quality varies, which is to be expected from the age of the source materials. Even viewed on large screen with great audio equipment, the DVD handles itself just fine.

I was born only a month and a half before the first Village People record came out, so I've been a fan since day one. I really treasure these guys. My father died when I was young, so they were strong male role models for me. Be yourself, be confident, be strong and have a good time! It's also nice to have this visual record of the late Glenn Hughes (Leatherman for most of the videos here) as he was my idol growing up. It's a shame I'll never be able to tell him that, but his talent and that toughness tempered with a little twinkle in his eye is recorded here for posterity.

Sorry, enough of my personal history. If you're thinking of buying this disc, don't hesitate! Whether you're a casual listener or a long-time fan, this DVD will give you a wonderful evening's entertainment! It's great for parties as well!",1375315200,4,2522,4.368869936034115
