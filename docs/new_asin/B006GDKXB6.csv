4985947,5,B006GDKXB6,"[SPOILERS abound...] `ROCKSTAR' as a tale of Sufi Wisdom: Imtiaz Ali, Rumi, AR Rahman & Irshad Kamil

Oh innocent bird, come home!
No matter how much you cut the air with your wings, you'll never be able to escape yourself. Break the skies! Burn the world! You won't be able to hide yourself. Take any path. You reside in you. You'll come back to your own Home. Oh innocent bird...
- O NADAAN PARINDE lyrics inspired and sung by AR Rahman

The 2011 Hindi film `Rockstar' can be interpreted as a love story woven with Sufi wisdom. I have found no evidence that the director & writer Imtiaz Ali is a Sufi, however in the film he uses verses from the Sufi master Rumi and an ongoing friendship with the Sufi AR Rahman indicates a shared respect and affinity. The Indian Hindi/Urdu poet Irshad Kamil wrote the lyrics to Rahman's compositions and has created unique fresh poetic images suffused in subtle hidden layers of Sufi metaphors.

The mystic will always perceive the world as a reflection of the Oneness pervading and permeating the All, thus romantic love is symbolic of our love for God. Tales of great profound and often deeply tragic love are understood as the seasons of the mystic's relationship with the invisible One. Like Mani Ratnam's film `DIL SE', the hidden devotional aspect of our mysterious illusive relationship with the God-within is what makes `Rockstar' compelling, mystical and ultimately classic.

Initially I watched this film because AR Rahman composed the music. However I began to notice how Imtiaz Ali chose to discreetly weave Rumi's Sufi influence throughout the film, especially in AR Rahman's music. In my copy of the `Rockstar' CD there is an illustrated insert with the song lyrics in Hindi. On the back page Imtiaz Ali writes Rumi, `whose words gave us new direction at every corner' and quotes the Sufi master thus:
Sometimes you hear a voice through the door calling you,
As fish out of water hears the sound of the waves
Or a hunting falcon hears the drums
Come back, come back.
This turning towards what you deeply love saves you.
Read the book of your life which has been given to you.
A voice comes to your Soul saying -
Lift your foot, cross over.
Move into Emptiness of question
and answer and question.

Imtiaz Ali says again in the CD insert, revealing the level of inspiration he felt: ""The film wanted to get itself made. It decided when it wanted to get made, how it wanted to get made and by who. I decided to never get in its way. Because I always knew that this film was bigger than me."" This is the sign of true from-the-heart creativity.

""Everything I wish to say is ruined by my words.""
 - From the Rahman song JO BHI MAIN. Sounds Taoist, does it not?

The film `Rockstar' begins with our hero Jordan, played by Ranbir Kapoor, as a mildly inert insensitive fellow who knows little of the journey into suffering he will eventually be driven to, but who nevertheless practices his guitar music with single-minded devotion. Jordan, who has been described by others as a bull of a young man, wants to be a rockstar. His older friend mentor tells Jordan that great music comes from only a broken heart. Aware that there has been little emotional pain in his life, Jordan decides to experience rejection in love and quite stupidly bluntly publicly declares his love for the prettiest `hot' girl in his school, who is named Heer after the heroine in popular tragic romance poetry. Heer is socially above him, and completely rejects and humiliates him. However, this brutal rejection is not enough to affect his appetite for fried samosas -- and we understand that his thick skin insensitivities will require the application of further assaults.

It is the girl's reaction to Jordan's sudden inappropriate crass declarations of love that shows her affinity with her absurd suitor. Her response is not at all ladylike, neat & clean refined and in a surprisingly belligerent anger Heer rudely tells him to ""bugger off""! So we sense in her a resonance with Jordan's own crude primal nature. Girls with aggressive successful fathers often share these warrior traits and underneath Heer's rich-girl veneer lies something akin to Jordan's wild nature. They are alike.

Eventually Jordan and Heer form a secret bond. Innocently they do what they call ""cheap"" things together, see dirty movies, drink cheap whiskey, and other silly harmless pranks that give her a sense of freedom, because Heer is to be married soon and whatever freedom she has known as a young single girl will vanish in the protected walled worlds of wealth and marriage. She will be the Lady, neat & clean -- no more ""cheap"" spontaneous expressions of her wild youth. For his part, Jordan appears willing to do anything for this girl who is far beyond his reach. His love is one of modesty, servitude and sacrifice, knowing he can never have her. Just before the wedding in Kashmir, Heer asks him to hug her. For a brief moment the embrace registers pain for both and then abruptly, she leaves him alone and hurt.
With Heer married, Jordan returns to India to fulfill his ambition to become a rock star and gets kicked out of his parent's house. Homeless, he takes refuge in the Delhi dargah shrine of the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya (see WIKI below), where he eats & sleeps with other homeless men. At the shrine, Jordan plays his guitar and joins in the singing of one of Rahman's Sufi qawwali songs KUN FAYA KUN, which means `You became'. The lyrics of the poet Irshad Kamil enrich Rahman's songs with Sufi wisdom. The song asks God for release from the small self.

Lyrics KUN FAYA KUN [translation from the subtitles on the DVD]: Move into emptiness, Painter, ""BE"" and there was. When even nothing was not, He alone existed. Who dwells in me, dwells in you. He is the Lord, the Illusion. Do me this favour, Lord, set me free from myself. Let me see myself, free from myself. You dwell in me, I dwell in you.

Jordan's inability to conform, to suppress his primal instinctual nature in the 'civilized' world, makes him and his music a magnet for what we have lost. While singing Sufi qawwali with the others at the shrine, Jordan is spotted by a famous older legendary shehnai player, who realizes that the young man has been 'touched by God's grace' and later encourages his recording company to promote Jordan. ""He will make you a fortune!"" Thus it is misfortune that leads Jordan to his intended destiny. Just as in our own lives, which often take painful and unwanted directions, we understand that through suffering what first appear as wrong turns with unintended consequences, we experience precisely what we need to learn and find the path that leads to our true Home.

Jordan continues on his rocky road to success, but remains unhappy. He feels as if 'little bugs' are eating away at him. His concert performances show his raw ability to express the deep darker hidden feelings of the crowd. As the onstage rockstar he absorbs their energies, their need to let out all their more primitive primordial nature. His rage becomes a sort of performance of madness that lets them channel their unexpressed feelings through him. Much has been written about this occult exchange of energy between the adoring raging fans at rock concerts and their idols who funnel and utilize these energies in the show. This kind of crowd psychology and manipulation are ancient instinctual timeless, maybe even necessary to youth, as the release of group energies is found in Dionysian rituals and other similar crowd behaviours throughout history.

Lyrics to SAADDA HAQ: Our right! Why do you choke my habit of living, this world is enemy, burn them, heart says, heart says to live by the heart, or die...I am nature too. Why do you teach lessons of truth when you cannot even listen to the truth...your far, your love, your praise, keep them!

The now married Heer is living Prague as the wealthy lady, but Heer the once wild youth feels trapped, despondent, bored, and is physically weakening. Both Jordan and Heer are beginning to understand that they cannot exist apart. Desperate to be with her, Jordan signs a contract that compromises his artistic freedom in exchange for a sojourn in Prague. Again our star-crossed lovers spend time together, which is life sustaining for both. In astrology, Venus and Pluto in hard aspect, meaning a square or an opposition, describe this kind of relationship where there is an intense attraction and passion followed by inevitable doom. Another indication may be Pluto in the 7th House of partnership and marriage.

Gradually the two grow closer and begin to touch with more than friendly intent. Heer resists, but Jordan is RAW and says to her -- ""Magic touch!"" Truly their forbidden touch has become the magic that is overwhelming both of them in an irresistible cauldron of desire, secrecy and guilt. Imtiaz Ali portrays the heat of their passion with subtle weak-in-the-knees accuracy. This is the `drowning in the sea of love' that everyone imagines they want to be in. These feelings of melting heat, dissolving into one another are precisely the reason why mystics throughout time have described their union with God as the Beloved in sexual terms. There is a loss of the sense of separate self as one dissolves into the larger ecstatic Self. The Rahman song AUR HO sung by Mohit Chauhan and Alma Ferovic describe their feverish state.

AUR HO lyrics: A statement of my helplessness, squeeze out all desire, break you in my arms, snatch you, let you go. Let there be more, this noise of breathing, and burn more, passion burning more. It just doesn't stop, does not tire, this storm of breath. Don't know what burns where...trembling.

Soon Heer can no longer endure the guilt of a 'heated' double life and betrayal of her husband, who is portrayed as a kind good man. She pushes Jordan away violently and for two years sinks into illness (aplastic anemia - a disease of the blood stem cells that reside in the bone marrow).  Her condition becomes so serious that her younger sister finally seeks out Jordan on tour and asks him to come to Heer's bedside. Jordan's intense devotion and the strength of his primal energies revive the dying Heer. The two spend gentle happy days together. The ill-fated Heer insists on accompanying Jordan to his scheduled concert, but his fans and the publicity hounds intrude on their private world, portraying Heer as the married adulterous lover. Sadly the two agree to part, but Heer has become pregnant. With her blood disease, pregnancy is unthinkable and she dies. Jordan goes a bit mad, in anger against himself knowing his unbridled passion has ultimately killed her.

The Rahman song O NADAAN PARINDE is the most powerful moment in the film. His beloved Heer is dead and yet Jordan must perform for 1000s of his fans. He is in a state of extreme agitation, angry with himself, and suffering unimaginable relentless grief.

O NADAAN PARINDE lyrics inspired and sung by Rahman: Oh innocent bird, come home! Why do you wander strange lands ravaged and tired like a vagabond day and night? Oh innocent bird, come Home. One hundred bruises cover your body. Clothes of all deeds are dirty. No matter how much you cut the air with your wings, you'll never be able to escape yourself. Break the skies! Burn the world! You won't be able to hide yourself. Take any path. You reside in you. You'll come back to your own Home. Oh innocent bird...(Jordan is now burning up the stage with his grief). Scavenging bird, it's my small plea, gorge on all my flesh. Don't eat my eyes. I hope to see my Beloved.

Jordan longs to see Heer once more and his broken heart despair is eloquently expressed by Ranbir Kapoor, who acts out and draws us into the terrible anguish of his agony to the point of madness in an intense performance, which film critics in India have rightly praised. Reaching the frenzied depths of his painful heartbroken loss, Jordan feels Heer's presence. Within the deafening cacophony of the crowd, we experience his inner silence as she emerges, lovely, and moves towards her beloved Jordan. She is happy, released from her diseased body, she is smiling. The song TUM KO, sung by Kavita Subamaniam along with the resonating superb sarangi of Dilshad Khan, conveys the mystery of love in Heer's tender feelings. She says, ""You I have finally got in a way that...like I am your feelings...close to you I am.""
Just as the mystic finally rests in union with the Beloved, the ubiquitous Oneness, so Jordan and Heer feel an intimate closeness that exists beyond death, transcending the limitations of the body and even Space/Time.

The last song is TUM HO: In what way will this world snatch you from me. You too are me. What's there to fear now? You are meant for me, in a way that I've lost myself to you and you I have won.
Included within the song is this verse from Rumi:

""Away, beyond all ideas of wrong doing and right doing, there is a field. I will meet you there.""

I will leave the contemplation of the lyrics to the reader. Let me just say that in spite of its flaws, this film has a depth to it not easily seen in one view. There are many mystical layers in `Rockstar' and these layers are revealed the more one understands the song lyrics. The powerful emotions expressed may draw you closer to your goal -- whispering as Rumi says, ""Come back, come back. This turning towards what you deeply love saves you.""

Our temporal existence...
Of course, the film can also be enjoyed as a romantic tragedy. But perhaps the reason why we never tire of these tales is simply that our temporal existence here on planet earth, where we are under the illusion of being in a state of Separation from our Source and true Self, may also be seen as a sort of often terrifying romantic tragedy.",1372291200,3,13788,4.72504159733777
4985948,5,B006GDKXB6,I enjoyed the drama and the scenery. The actress is beautiful and did well on this movie. I also enjoyed most of the rock songs,1354406400,,127,4.12
4985949,3,B006GDKXB6,"The music is simply stellar, Rahman delivers again.

Mohit Chauhan is almost as good a singer as Sukhwinder Singh would have been in this role which is saying a lot. The lead guitar work by Orianthi Panagaris is outstanding as expected. All in all a great experience. See the movie simply for the music and the settings, esp songs like 'Kun faya kun'.

The movie fails on many fronts.

SPOILER ALERT - shoddy direction with a very confusing timeline, incomplete details such as the illness the heroine is said to suffer from, typical Indian movie physician who can diagnose a pregnancy just by examining the eyes of a patient. No idea what 'operation' she undergoes after that, not sure why the police arrest him and finally, why is he playing to a packed crowd at the huge amphitheater in Prague? I mean, since when do Czechs speak Hindi or much less sing in Hindi? Why do the goons attack him in the alley? If it is revenge by the husband, surely he has the means to do it in a better way, esp since the attackers are dressed the same way as the star!

It seems like key scenes in the movie were deleted and now it's all disjointed and inconsistent.

Ranbir's acting is good, though he is somewhat wooden at times. Convincing as a rockstar on stage though (must have watched quite a few videos). Nargis is so-so. Indian actresses must learn how to cry well  and she does a good job of that, but her performance is otherwise flat.

Still, in the end it is a good story, though with a flawed premise - you do not need pain to be creative, the Bard is the greatest proof of that as is Picasso and a whole host of others.

Worth watching, but only for the music.",1347667200,,1660,4.366883116883117
4985950,1,B006GDKXB6,"Imagine a power drill making a high-pitched whine as it bores through your forehead.

You can hear the pitch shift as the drill bit slows down when it hits the tough frontal bone. At this point, you want to beg your tormentor to stab your ear drums out, just so that you won't have to hear the sickening whine. But you don't. You know that doing so would make the dreadful sound conducted through your skull only more prominent.

All thought processes are interrupted as you hear the hot drill bit sizzle into your frontal lobe. That's when your pupils roll, scraping the top of the ocular cavity. Your tongue slides out of the corner of your mouth as your jaw comes unhinged. Technically, you aren't dead, but then you aren't really alive either.

Being forced to watch Rockstar is pretty much the same - only more painful.",1337990400,,824,4.554054054054054
4985951,5,B006GDKXB6,"Ranbir Kapoor delivers a powerhouse performance. The songs are probably some of the best in the recent decade. The story is gorgeously developed and portrayed. The emotions are intense. Probably, the best film to come out of bollywood in a long time. Highly recommended. If you liked this, i would highly recommend another amazing hindi film, 'Ekk Dewanna Tha' 2012. Both are beautiful films. Hope this review helped. :)",1334966400,4,420,5.101449275362318
4985952,5,B006GDKXB6,"Not the logest review I'll ever write, but here goes... I'm half way through and loving it.  Ranbir Kapoor plays the part brilliantly, with Nargis Fakhri initially playing a bit of a spoiled brat, but if you look at her as just that, it's understandable.  From then on the cinematography is fantastic - love the soundtrack (I'd buy it) and so looking forward to watching the second half.  Not so much of a traditional Bollywood film (although I am a Bollywood amateur) with no mass dance scenes, but otherwise... I'll be looking out for more films with Ranbir in.",1333065600,,563,4.666666666666667
4985953,2,B006GDKXB6,"It was a dismal movie experience,I had heard and read good things about movie but it turned out to be a ordeal to watch this movie. Even the music is drab and lyrics are just clumsily written. The only good things about this movie is its cool cinematography,beautiful locales breathtakingly captured and Nargis too sometimes reminds me of young Julia Roberts.

Ranbeer is good here and their especially in his college days otherwise he seems shallow and play acting. His youthful years are done really well and very different from any of his previous works. Imtiaz Ali is a great let down,direction and script are both shoddy. His previous movies have been so good but this is bad. Shammi Kapoor is good in his last appearance. Better see it on DVD where you can fast forward. It does draw inspiration from ""Baiju Bawra"" which had a similar character. Also it may remind you of ""Rock On"".Few people were in the theater and few had any good words for this dismal movie. Rather see ""Stage Door"" at home which stars Katharine Hepburn,Rockstar's last seen reminded me of this gem of a movie where a room-mate's tragic suicidal death inspires Hepburn's performance onstage as if her spirit guided her through it. Avoid ""Rockstar"" sheer waste of time and money.",1327968000,,1255,4.783410138248848
4985954,4,B006GDKXB6,"A bumbling idiot, Janardhan Jakhar ( Ranbir Kapoor) wants to be as famous as his idol the crude, lascivious musician Jim Morrison. Although Jakhar is talented, he somehow lacks the soul that makes great music. The remedy, according to his mentor, for creating great music is heartbreak and pain. His search for pain leads him to the most beautiful girl on his college campus, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). The dogged pursuit finally leads to a beautiful platonic companionship for both of them, but just before her marriage to a rich guy in Prague, they both realize their true feelings for each other. Heer leaves and Janardhan turns in to Jordan, as christened by Heer, and he ascends stardom, his descent begins.
I thought the film was a long documentary but an interesting one, you sit glued to your seats through the entire marathon. The film is nearly 3 hours long and takes you back and forth, Delhi, to Kashmir and then to Prague as Jordan tries to make sense of fame, life and love. This tread does not deter you because it has been interspersed with one of the best soundtracks of the year. Whether it is Kun Faya Kun, Nadaan Parinde, or the sublime duet ( jugalbandi) `Dichotomy of fame' between Shammi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor, the music leaves you simply breathless. This is no ordinary soundtrack and AR Rahman's music is the soul of Rockstar. The spine is Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers one of the most energized performances in recent memories. If Rockstar is riveting, its because of this act and it will stay with you after you leave the show. From the idiocy of his early days to the arrogance after finding fame, Ranbir keeps you in a trance, whether it is the dance tribute to Shammi Kapoor, his clumsy efforts to woo Heer, or his pained expression when he is thrown out by his family, Ranbir lives the role of Janardhan Jakhar and Jordan. Nargis Fakhri is elegant but deserves some acting lessons, but the chemistry that the lead pair share is amazing. Kumud Mishra as Jordan's manager is superb. Aditi Rao Hydari is confident and beautiful as the journalist on the trail of Jordan. Piyush Mishra as the manager of Platinum Music is hilarious. Shammi Kapoor has a decent cameo.
The cinematography is superb, and Anil Mehta has done a great job capturing Delhi, Prague and Kashmir. Imtiaz Ali has directed well, but since this is a non-linear story, he loses a bit of a focus in the process. Overall, I strongly recommend this film; I watched the premiere showing but plan to see it soon again. 4 stars. 11/11/11",1324080000,9,2527,4.680898876404495
4985955,5,B006GDKXB6,"I am surprised that no reviews have been written on this movie yet by customers. This movie left such a lasting impression on me. For days I couldn't think about anyone else except Jordan/Janardan.
While I absolutely loved Jab we met, still I would say this one takes Imtiaz Ali high on the list of india's best directors. While Jab we met had more Comic appeal, this movie has got so much emotional appeal that it's hard to get disconnected with Jordan after the movie has ended. Your emotions r so strongly involved with the story and the Hero. A Hero who hates him selves. And your heart goes out to him because you know he is only Human for the mistakes he has committed.
'Infidelity' such an ugly word, takes a completely new meaning here. Infedilty has got three dimensions. The two who r in relationship with each other and third dimension which is alone and without any support which is called 'other man/woman'. How we love to hate them! Oh, I have hated her. Yes,I am talking about my own life! But while watching this movie I could see her in Ranbir's character. I could feel her helplessness and rage through jordan's and suddenly I am not angry with her at all. I used to call her parasite. But the thing is like Jordan she also didn't have anyone else in her life. So she was just trying to hold on to what wasn't hers anyway.
Ranbir  Kapoor has given his finest performance and I think even he would have a difficult time trying to top this one! My only complaint from this movie is the choice of leading lady. She looks good but there is something missing in her performance. She can't bring depth to this character. In fact Heer seems like a very selfish person who would get involved with Jordan although she is the married one and then cut it off conveneintly when she realizes it's getting out of hand.
But Ranbir makes up for even her performance. So I am not complaining.
Out of the world, mind-blowing songs. My favorites"" sadda Haq"","" Nadaan Parindey"","" Hawa Hawa"","" Aur ho"" ,""katiya karoon"" . Have I missed any one? Or may be I love the whole album. No use trying to pick some.

This one is like that for me. Incredibly deep and somehow innocent at the same time; blazingly powerful (non-violent) and tender and passionate. From here, it was from the foundation of the MUSIC of AR Rahman that Ranbir and this leading lady shine so brightly; their chemistry is profound and particularly shape shifting for him. But it's an epic film in so many ways. I've heard that people either love it with the kind of wonder that I feel for it or don't like it; so you never know.

When both disks arrived, I was disappointed to discover that the Rockstar DVD included many additional features such as deleted scenes, making of featurettes, interviews, commentaries and concert rehearsals... while the Blu-Ray version only had the movie and commentary.

This is the second movie I own from Eros Entertainment where their DVD version of the same movie contains much more additional features than their basic Blu-Ray counterpart. I decided to keep both the DVD for the special features and the Blu-Ray as well.
