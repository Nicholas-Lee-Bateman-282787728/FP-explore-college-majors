6447345,3,B00KTZAL2S,"The acting was excellent. And they did a great job of a creating a very realistic back-to-the-earth counter culture community. The real weak part was that you never got a good fix on the two main characters. I'm sure they were supposed to morph over the course of the movie, as they were weighted down with guilt and disillusionment but it was not continuous.  It was abrupt enough so that the viewer is continually asking himself  now why would this character do that?  A much better movie, with similar dynamics is A Simple Plan  released in 1998.  I can't spoil the ending to this; it seriously did not have one.",1410307200,6,615,4.554545454545455

6447347,5,B00KTZAL2S,"This is a slow moving ""dirty scheme gone wrong"" that still engages your full interest and attention.  It doesn't allow anything to distract you from these three destructive characters' thoughts and feeling, how those might be similar, how they might be different, how they might change due to circumstances, and how the three might be diverging from each other depending on morals, emotions, and mental stability.  Ultimately it shows three fairly distinct attempts to deal with guilt.  A lesser film would have stopped at superficial outward conflicts.  This script is much more subtle and internal, so the actors get to reveal a lot with just a slight change of facial expression, body language, or tone of voice.",1409875200,2,715,5.085470085470085
6447348,3,B00KTZAL2S,"""One person, that's all it takes."" Josh (Eisenberg) and Dena (Fanning) are young environmentalists who are sick of watching the planet get destroyed. Along with a man named Harmon they come up with a plan to blow up a hydro-electric dam as a protest to what is happening. There are a few bumps but for the most part things go according to plan. When the papers the next day report something unexpected the three protesters become scared and trust is challenged. I wasn't sure what to expect from this at all but I was hoping for a movie like The East. That movie was very tense and I really enjoyed it, kinda like an Erin Brokovich on steroids. This one was not like that. On the other hand though I think this one is more realistic. This one deals with three people who are not affiliated with any organization who try to make a big statement but it doesn't go has planned. No one is a loud mouth or draws attention to themselves which is good for what they are doing, but not for a movie. This is very slow and has very little dialog. The movie isn't bad but never quite gets as tense and suspenseful as needed. Acting is good but the movie was really lacking something to make an impact on me. Overall, not terrible but slow and methodical. Almost too slow to stay focused on. I give this a B-.",1409184000,,1297,4.319672131147541
6447349,3,B00KTZAL2S,"""Night Moves"" is a film that, much like ""Meek's Cutoff"", will probably generate a lot of division between viewers. There will be those captivated by the simple, straightforward storytelling that relies on the tension. Josh (Jesse Eisenberg) and two co-horts Dena (Dakota Fanning) and Harmon (Peter Sarsgaard) plot to blow up a dam in Oregon. Others will probably dismiss this effort as dull, pretentious and stretching 45 minutes of plot into 2 hours for little reason at all.

The truth probably lies in the middle as the first half of ""Night Moves"" is actually quite good. We know little about the three characters and start with their final preparations to blow up the dam. The tension builds as they obtain the final amount of fertilizer needed for the explosives that they pack into a boat and press up against the dam. This part of the film is very well crafted with good cinematography, a brooding atmosphere and characters who certainly feel the weight of what they are trying to accomplish while not realizing the full consequences.

However, the second part of the film drags and is flawed almost precisely because of what made the first half work. Since we know little to nothing about them, when things start to come undone we simply do not care. There was no passion, no drive, no real purpose to the crime they committed, so how are we suppose to feel for them when an unexpected consequence of their actions shifts the intentions of what their statement was suppose to be?

Another strange part of the film is a scene with Josh's employer who seemingly knows what is going on and uses language direct enough to imply the weight of the crime that has been committed. But how could he really know? Assuming he did given how he supposedly found out, then why isn't the entire town on Josh's head for this? Yet, no one else seems to know which is bizarre.

I suppose I could blame Jesse Eisenberg for turning in a performance that is so quiet and brooding that it's really difficult to see any change in his personality both before and after the sabotage takes place. Because it is difficult to feel for him, his fate becomes less interesting as the movie plods towards its final conclusion. The climax of the film which should be a real shocking moment instead comes across almost as an afterthought.

Poor Alia Shawkat has the thankless role of ""Surprise"" and works with Josh at the farm, but she is give little to do. The rest of the cast performs well and all of them have this dour attitude which does fit in with the endless amount of rain that happens throughout the movie.

Of course, with Kelly Reichard at the helm we get another ""film runs out"" ending just like ""Meek's Crossing"". Frankly, it's a little too pretentious even for my tastes and felt like a cop-out to make the film more ""indie"" in nature. This is because if that is the ending we are going to get, it could have happened earlier in the film without changing any of the impact.

I was disappointed with ""Night Moves"", which is actually a terrible name for this film although there is a logical reason for it. This is certainly a film with two separate halves which starts with real promise, but drags after that until the camera runs out of film.",1404691200,15,3232,4.610434782608696
6447350,5,B00KTZAL2S,"I've heard that it's a truism among Hollywood producers that ""Nobody goes to the movies to get depressed."" I suppose that's why writer-director Kelly Reichardt is yet doing indie films.

There's nothing typical of Hollywood in this unpleasant film -- no cyborgs, superheros, special effects, car chases or guns. (I never realized that it was possible to make a movie without guns -- I mean, with Glock having their industry-wide contract for product placement and all.)  Nor is the story told out-of-sequence; there are no flashbacks, nor does a scene turn out to be a dream -- with the actress suddenly sitting up in bed and gasping.

Nor are there good guys versus bad guys. I suspect that audiences will be alienated by the fact that the leading characters are all not-quite likable. Flawed characters -- a new concept. Huh.

In place of clichs, gimmickry and artifice, though, Night Moves delivers a plausible situation with realistic scenes. The acting is all subdued to the point that you're not aware that it's acting. I had never seen Dakota Fanning acting as an adult before, and I was impressed by her natural performance. (For some reason, I had assumed that she was maybe like a small Cameron Diaz.)

I'm afraid that I can't recommend Night Moves on the basis of suspense, because you pretty-much know what's going to happen -- the worst. The topical plot is not complex, and for that reason I advise you not to view the trailer. It gives away too much.  Avoid the reviews. Despite this, the movie remains uniformly intense throughout. When leaving the theater, I had to consciously relax my facial muscles. (I'm surprised that I didn't break out in a rash from watching Ms. Fanning.)  It's not the story so much as how well it's told.

I usually dislike slow-paced movies, but this one held my attention . There's not a scene that should've been cut (on second thought, maybe the nude scene), and the camera work by Chris Blauvelt is outstanding.

The decision whether to watch this movie or not simply comes down to the choice between the usual escapist-action-sex adolescent fantasy, or this depiction of how real people would react in a bad situation they have brought on themselves.

In short, despite the youthful protagonists, it's a grown-up movie for grownups.

I'd go so far as to rate this movie higher than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1975-movie/dp/B0009GX1CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1975 movie</a>&nbsp;of the same title directed by the late Arthur Penn.",1402704000,12,2533,5.108958837772397
6447351,4,B00KTZAL2S,"I imagine some folks were drawn to Night Moves based on the skeletal plot outline offered by Amazon. Hence lots of bad reviews from people expecting a movie that conforms to suspense-genre rules. But anyone who has seen and liked director Kelly Reichardt's earlier movies will know that action and suspense are not her objectives; she's all about slow, careful observation of her characters in their environments. For my money, she's one of our best directors in drawing out extraordinary performances with minimal dialog or production resources. Fast pacing and CGI effects are exchanged for a trio of remarkable performances in Night Moves. As a measure of the restraint in the storytelling here, neither of the two movie's most pivotal events actually occur on camera. This is clearly a film for those who enjoy subtle narratives and careful character development and who possess the patience to allow those things to play out.",1516665600,,930,5.125

6447355,5,B00KTZAL2S,"Astounding (or nor really) that the illiterate consumers who populate Amazon's viewer base would review this film so poorly, when what you have here is a brilliantly subtle and aesthetically staggering film of literary import that, above all, actually asks difficult questions (albeit without answering them in the spoon-fed style of the Hollywood major motion picture). Reichardt is more attune to the language of late '60s/early '70s film, back when story and insinuation mattered, when actors got to act and the viewer had to (and had time to) think a little bit. This was a favorite of the past few years, for its complexity and for the questions it raises about some of the most important issues of our time.

""A member of a hippy co-op wants to blow up a dam.  The try to blow up the dam.  The blow up the dam.""  I'm not even sure why they want the dam gone, except for a vague mention of water apportionment in the NW, and maybe an allusion to salmon ladders.  No intrigue, no personal conflict about doing damage to nature while trying to fix it.. yada yada..  SPOILER follows:  There's a hint of intrigue when someone is killed after the dam goes, but we get no information about that person to personalize the angst.  I guess the movie is really about best-laid-plans, since 1 of the group decides they need to come clean (since somebody died), and the other needs to stop them.  Odd, since they did a whole lot more damage than just killing somebody.  And, all the intrigue surround them going their separate ways..  Seems like this was a 1-person job all along.

6447376,5,B00KTZAL2S,"Night Moves is an environmental thriller in a post 9/11 world. Ideological purity has become allied to terrorism. We get three activists, Josh(Eisenberg), Dena( Fanning) and Harmon(Sarsgaard), who come together to commit an act, but are unaware of the consequences, which they see as collateral damage. They are all like strangers, but united by a common cause, to blow up a dam, which they know is killing salmon, to run their iPods all day. Kelly Reichardt is a rule-bound director, to whom this subject by its very nature, would appeal. In her films(Meeks Cutt Off, Wendy and Lucy) there is this sense of the individual and the collective, a revisionist spirit that explores old subjects in new ways. The 3 actors involved have a certain pedigree in playing slightly difficult, downbeat characters. Here their only judge is their own conscience; however, as in Crime and Punishment, there is a price to pay for ones humanity, as a result of one's actions.

Subdued, claustrophobic, tautly-coiled, we get the build up from their base of normal lives, Josh works on a familys organic farm, where he can run for cover after the explosion. He is shown attending activist meetings with Dena, a wealthy rebel , where they hatch their plan and involve an ex-marine, psychedelic warrior (Harmon), to make the explosive. They drive to a fertiliser supplier and get Dena to go in and buy 500 lb.of ammonium nitratrate, for use, she is told to say, on 10 acres of farmland for her vegetables. Asked for her social security card(she has a fake ID), she nearly fails, saying she didn't bring it, but is just able to get by, saying the farm produces well known products, backed up by two farmers who have just come in. Dena and Josh discuss whether Harmon is OK, Josh saying hes tried and tested. Harmon asks
Josh whether Dena needs to be along with them in this action, Josh answers shes good to go. Dena and Josh purchase a cabin speed-boat to get close to the dam, to plant the explosives, well-packed in its hull. We hear the explosion in the background, no special effects.

There are anxieties, fears and paranoia, leading up to the event, taking place mainly at night. The 3 actors talk to each other in monosyllables, or barely look at each other, as the tension mounts, as they work out where any CCTV cameras might be placed,when they pull up at the camping site area, where theyll launch their boat from. Eisenberg is particularly good at suggesting himself as the thermostat of paranoia, the neurotic loner. After the explosion they split up and don't communicate until Dena is particularly affected by a lone man who lost his life camping out in the area. Harmon phones Josh to inform him that the dam against communication has burst, as Dena phones
him continuously, expressing her worries about their action. Josh is asked by the farmer to leave, as he hears from the fallout of Denas recriminations. Josh does leave but is so in need of support he phones Harmon to ask  go away with him. Dena is by now frightened of Joshs presence. Great use of gravel, torchlight and shadow in the night scenes.",1465171200,,3101,4.738888888888889

She also has a sense of humor and seems more empathetic than her partners.

For many - myself included - the powerful grounding performance from Jesse Eisenberg, the gorgeous cinematography as we coast silently down a lake, the exquisite, unpredictable tension wrought from things as simple as purchasing fertilizer or waiting for someone to change a tire, all of these things and more will make Night Moves a powerfully memorable film. But it is, as I said, an incredibly slow movie, a thriller in the classical sense with art film aesthetics and a tendency towards long, torturous silences. If you want to turn your brain off and lose yourself in the artistry of filmmaking, Night Moves is a strong choice, but this is not a movie the impatient or those who check their phones or laptops regularly while watching will be able to enjoy.",1429142400,5,837,4.819444444444445
6447448,2,B00KTZAL2S,"Night Moves has words on the DVD cover such as ""A riveting thriller"", ""Almost Hitchcockian"" and other ridiculous claims that are completely absurd as there is no thriller element  or twist in the story or anything like this.  This is really just a fly on the wall observation of a dumb young couple teaming up with an older hardened environmentalist to become green terrorists with a plan to blow up a dam.  This movie just abruptly ends, there is no ending, it's like the makers were being warned the budget is running out, we'd better write an ending and film it and those filming it just told each other don't worry, there's always money, if we don't have an ending they'll have to give us more.  Spoilers follow but there isn't really much to spoil.  Then when they showed what they'd done so far the investors said, ""What? This is boring, what did you do with the money we paid you to blow up a fake dam? It's not in the film, all there was, was a landslide sound effect which I assume was supposed to be the explosion and some fire engines driving the other way, and why by the way are these environmentalists driving petrol thirsty vehicles, you do realise their lifestyle decisions should be about caring about the planet, and why would they buy such a huge boat when a smaller one would have blended in better and be remembered by less people than a giant red one?  Plus why would the bomb have an unnecessary huge glowing red numerals countdown digital clock on it that would have lit up with its brightness the explosives for a security guard of anyone on the dam wall to see?  You're not getting any more money to finish this!"" Then even though Eisenberg's character had put parts of his phone in the back of different local vehicles in a camping store car park in some town, you'd assume to throw those hunting him off his track as he moves onto somewhere else, they substituted him buying some survival equipment and used up the last minute left of film in the camera and said, ""Hey extra guy operating the till in the sporting goods store, you would have loved to have some lines in the film wouldn't you, yeah yeah oh we can't pay you but how about you pretend Eisenberg is applying for a job with you. Oh I don't know what to say just ask him if he lives around here or something and give him a form."" That doesn't make any sense he thought but hey I want to be a star so ""of course I'll do it!"" he replied.

The film is very slow paced and pretty boring for most parts.  The movie does have a more authentic feel as they have gone with average somewhat unattractive people for the extras and minor speaking roles on the organic farm and other locations rather than the usual Hollywood style with everyone being good looking, but at least when Hollywood does this the nice to look at people can somewhat alleviate the boredom.  Odd writing too not just the non ending, but why have a pushy annoying salesman ask Dakota if he can help her then when she asks where what she wants to buy is he asks her rudely as if she is stupid if she has looked in the other building, in real life you'd straight away get up him with why the f would you ask me if you could help me if you didn't really want to?  Surely it would have made much more sense for them to have stolen the boat and trailer from someone who stored it somewhere they wouldn't notice it until the dam is bombed and the fertiliser from one of the farmers who stopped for a beer on the way home or something by simply stealing his truck.

Plus the main characters especially Dakota's are inconsistent.  She didn't seem to care about the human side of the aftermath of their terrorist plan but once someone goes missing she can't handle it.",1428710400,,3711,4.353111432706223

6447503,4,B00KTZAL2S,"Night Moves plods along, but that doesn't mean its a bad movie. It is more of a character study than a thriller. You follow three idealists turned eco-terrorists through the final preparations and execution of their plot. Of course, things go horribly wrong after. It's a bit of a case study in unintended consequences. The acting is very good; cinematography also brilliant. The mood is set and continues all the way through. That said, it is a minimalist movie containing few characters and simple locations, which adds to the mood but detracts from the complexity of the story. There could have been many more contrasts to demonstrate the cause/effect of the mission. Alas, this was left out. Still, the movie is worth watching for the honesty of it.

6447506,5,B00KTZAL2S,"Contrary to what many people say, this is not merely a film about environmentalists conspiring to blow up a dam. Actually, it has little to do with environmentalism. Environmentalism is the film's setup, but it is not the film's theme. If it were, blowing up the dam would have ultimately amounted to something to *reflect* on environmentalism, and it didn't. (It was even stated in the film that blowing up the dam was essentially useless beyond serving as a statement because there were several dams along the river.) The focus is on the *aftermath* of the characters' actions and how they reflect on *them* as people. Dena, the naive, self-confident kid is awakened to the gravity of what she's done and dissolves into a nervous wreck; Harmon, the apathetic veteran who's seen it all, remains practically unaffected; Josh, the dogmatic environmentalist begins to second-guess himself (especially in light of the missing camper), treading the line between self-justification and regret. The story follows how three very different people respond to an ethically questionable deed, and how their reactions clash and create a destructive chain reaction. Dena's crippling guilt leads her to come clean, which leads Josh to lose everything he held dear (a family, a home) and descend into rage, then later paranoia; meanwhile, Harmon stays distant and moves on.

This film is about the complexity of right and wrong (is it solely based on actions, or do intentions count?). It is about when, if ever, the end justifies the means. Haunting and beautiful, I give it 5 stars!",1421884800,,1569,5.0813953488372094

6447508,5,B00KTZAL2S,"If you're expecting a debate on ""The Environment"" in a talky, preachy way, you won't get it here.  This film is a very cloistered, human drama.  It's about a world within a world, where a completely different way of speaking, dressing, working is self-contained.  The film focuses on these people who will seem all so familiar to those who live in the Northwest.  The outside world of suburbs and industry is presented as foreign and impinging on their paradise (like in an Amish community).  So, this is the interplay, and yes, the film does offer many visual ironies (like eco-terrorists driving around in 4 wheel drive trucks) or what some might call hypocrisy, but as a film it does this in a factual way.  The 3 main characters are brilliantly written.  They have that perfectly accurate mix of group effort but which ultimately ends in a kind of ""you're on your own, man"" individuality.  It's a very rich film that puts you inside their world and the final twenty minutes is indeed jarring in relationship to the cocoon of the rest of the film.  It's in many ways a morality play of what happens when you decide to bit into knowledge and interact with the outside (forbidden) world.",1421452800,,1188,4.673076923076923

6447512,4,B00KTZAL2S,"Fine performances here from Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning, and Peter Sarsgaard, and good direction and cinematography to boot.  The setting is rural Oregon, and it's well-photographed here.  The atmosphere of people trying to live ""naturally"" is well caught, in the scenes in an organic farm and at a spa where two of the main characters work.  The film takes its time, so that we get a sense of the different characters as we watch how they interact with one another and go about the logistics of getting material for a bomb and then carrying out the mission to which they have dedicated themselves -- blowing up a dam to protest the carelessness and over-consumption that seems to them to threaten the human future.  Josh (Eisenberg) and Dena (Fanning) take themselves seriously, but are quite distinct as characters.  Harmon (Sarsgaard) seems looser and easier, but is competent nonetheless.  In fact, as an ex-Marine, he is the most competent of all and the one who is able to live most easily with some unforeseen consequences.  The interest here is almost totally internal -- while we see them suspensefully manipulate a boat loaded with fertilizer into position to blow up the dam, we don't see the explosion or the effects on the area.  Nor is there much ideological talk -- Instead we see Josh and Dena back at work and coming to terms with the consequences of what they have done.

Early in the movie, we see Josh remove a dead deer, a pregnant doe, from a road, and we get the point that Josh's eco-terrorism springs from a respect and even tenderness for life.  When a human life is lost as a result of their action, Josh and Dena are undone to varying degrees.  Eisenberg throughout the movie has given the impression of keeping things bottled up inside himself.  Dena is a rich girl who seems to easily accommodate to what is being planned, but like Josh the idea of having taken a life, especially when they have been seeing their enterprise as striking a blow for the human future, causes her great anguish, and it soon seems likely that their determination not to contact one another or to reveal anything about what they have done is unlikely to be sustained.  In the interests of avoiding further spoilers, I'll just add that not everything is settled by the end of the movie, and this might bother viewers who want all loose ends tied, but the essential point has been dramatized.  We know the cost of what has been done and that it was a cost that had never been really counted in the lead-up to the act -- except perhaps by Harmon, who is by temperament and experience the person least likely to bother with such costs.

We don't know much about the characters' histories, and the corrosive effects of guilt on well-meaning people have been the subject of many film and literary plots in the past, so it's true (as some reviewers complain) that the movie's insights are not original.  But when do movies have really original insights?  What matters here is that the familiar theme is embodied convincingly and arrestingly by the cast, and there was enough suspense in the plot -- heightened by Josh's near-paranoia in the later scenes -- to keep my attention engaged.",1420761600,,3191,4.710431654676259

I appreciate that it brought a new angle to the whole eco-terrorist story. In the case of this story, I feel we are given more psychological conflict than with other films of similar topic. We are given characters who believe very, very strongly in something, but are presented with circumstances which cause them to battle with the importance of it all, along with other things. In the end, I think it is a great commentary on the subject of taking a stand for what you believe in and when to pick your battles.

This may be spoilery, but my favorite parts are where these characters peers, unknowing of their actions, show opinions that are polar opposite of what the leads had considered during their state of clouded excitement during their protest.

6447624,5,B00KTZAL2S,"About 10 years ago, I read perhaps the greatest article I've ever encountered in Rolling Stone magazine involving a clique of home-grown U.S. eco-terrorists. They were essentially cut from the same cloth - Caucasian, college educated and upper middle-class. Once they decided to enter a life of crime, which included the bombing of hotels and ski resorts constructed on virgin land, it was only a matter of time before they were caught by the FBI. One soul, who quoted from what was then the current Spike Lee film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-X/dp/B001L4I43O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm X</a>, was soon captured. Once he faced the reality of a life behind bars for terrorism, he committed suicide.

The truth of a criminal (or revolutionary) life as opposed to, I don't know, the romantic ideal espoused by such Hollywood films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Town-2010/dp/B004CEUEWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Town (2010)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001I189MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, are two entirely different things. How far is one willing to go? And once you've crossed such a line, what are the consequences?

Kelly Reichardt's immensely fascinating 2013 drama ""Night Moves"" details this ominous line, crossed by three eco-terrorists portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning and Peter Sarsgaard. These moody Oregon free-spirits have hatched a plan to bomb a local dam as a political statement against the evils of environmental capitalism. In scenes so perfectly suspenseful they should be studied in film class, they pack a boat with hundreds of pounds of fertilizer and dynamite and quietly motor to the dam in the dead of night. The consequences for such an act lead to paranoia, tragedy and what appears to be a terrifying form of suburban enslavement.

This is the third Reichardt film I've seen in the last couple of years, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wendy-and-Lucy/dp/B001EUSYIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wendy and Lucy</a>&nbsp;(2008) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meek-s-Cutoff/dp/B0057IAPBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meek's Cutoff</a>&nbsp;(2010), and what a discovery. She's not only one of the great directors of her generation, but I am going to go sexist and say she is the greatest female director in history. Her films, independent, quiet and challenging, possess the power of Stanley Kubrick's languid eye (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley-Kubrick-The-Complete-Films/dp/3836527758/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films</a>). Like his almost impossible-to-match films, Reichardt's works leave an undeniable impression that will provoke thought for months afterward.

While Kubrick delved into satire, war, science fiction and horror, leisurely-paced scenes would go on for minutes at a time leading to conclusions difficult to fathom. When you awaken the morning after, only then, do you start to realize just what he was up to. I have the same feeling with Reichardt's work, her subtle strokes painted with a quiet touch so uncommon today. They say she's a minimalist director, which I suppose can be defined as the explosions are heard rather than seen.

It's not a news flash to say these three superb actors, Eisenberg, Fanning and Sarsgaard, deliver fine performances in what must have been extremely challenging roles. I also love the lush locales, filmed with earthy grace by Christopher Blauvelt. This is a beautiful world poisoned by an ideal that will ironically destroy the landscape.

But with the inclusion of Jesse Eisenberg, who has mastered playing pretentious characters, there is the question of whether the film is another shallow depiction of eco-activism? One which seeks to make eco-activist look crazy more so than reveal the reasoning behind some of the more extreme acts they commit to protect the environment.

Characters & Story

Everything begins with two people, a would-be couple named Josh (Jesse Eisenberg) and Dena (Dakota Fanning). They buy a $10k boat and then drive up into the middle of nowhere to meet a friend named Harmon (Peter Sarsgaard). Making for what looks like a normal movie in which a couple heads into the woods to go camping. Truth is however, Josh and Dena aren't a couple and their friend Harmon is more so an accomplice. One which is helping them execute a bombing of a dam. Though with one life possibly lost, post-bombing, and Dena talking a bit more than she should, what will the boys do? Go into hiding, shut her up, or will they in the end surrendering themselves for the guilt of possibly killing a man weighs too heavy? Youll have to watch the film to find out.

Praise

When it comes to praise, really the only thing I liked is when Josh and Dena seemed like a couple. If just because Eisenberg and Fanning look like a believable couple for between Fanning seeming like a deer in the headlights, and a bit spacey, combined with Eisenbergs sarcasm, somehow they seem like a good match. Unfortunately though, there time seeming like a couple doesnt last too long, but is good while it lasts.

Criticism

One thing I always disliked about movies like these is that usually there isn't a strong justification for the criminal acts. Also, there almost always seems to be some type of distraction which takes away from the goal of blowing up a dam, oil power plant, or what have you. Most of the time it is some sort of romantic plot which becomes the main focus, other times it is because of cult or hippie elements which make you raise an eyebrow. But for Night Moves specifically, the issue is that these kids, and Harmon, just seem so barely informed about what they are doing.

I mean, think of Harmon, Dena, and Josh like online activist who saw something trending and decided to physically go out there and do something. However, while they seem to actually care enough to physically do something, it seems all their information and reasoning is shallow and not fully thought out in terms of consequences besides jail time. Making it where after the dam is blown up, and someone and their family is affected, the sole interesting part of the film is gone. Of which, sadly we don't see the explosion. All we get to see, post bombing, is Fanning look like a deer in the headlights while she talks, Eisenberg come off like he has botox injections and is incapable of expressing himself, and Sarsgaard in another movie which he is this odd older guy who for some reason befriends people at least 10-15 years younger than him.

Overall: Skip It

Making for an overall story which doesnt have much to offer at all. There isn't a cool strong build to the dam blowing up; there isn't some type of cute, or interesting, relationship going on between Dena and Josh to maybe take note of; Harmon and the casts don't hang out and he doesnt tell us war stories; and watching the cast deal with the weight of their guilt for nearly two hours is really a test of patience. Especially since no one has any type of charisma, no type of personality which hooks you, and there isn't even a strong reason given which would make you think they were justified in blowing up that dam. Hence the skip it label. For while the actors themselves maybe likeable, for the most part, this is the type of film which doesnt really deserve 2 hours of your time.",1410566400,3,4049,4.596952908587258
