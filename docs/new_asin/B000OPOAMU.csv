2798560,5,B000OPOAMU,"Well the set is awesome. The movies superb. The bonus features wonderful. However, you may want to wait until Fox/MGM make a Run-change on this because mine came without disc 2 for ""Fistful..."" and instead came with TWO disc 2's for ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" which means i didn't get the Made for American TV intro for Fistful featuring Harry S. Stanton... Major Bummer.",1186358400,3,378,4.656716417910448
2798561,5,B000OPOAMU,"I have been waiting a long time for these, and they are excellent!

Although I am happy to see the renamed ""A Fistful of Dynamite"", I wish they would have included ""Once Upon a Time In the West""? Although I am a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, I beleive that ""Once Upon a Time In the West"" was Leone's best western!",1185580800,3,311,4.183333333333334
2798562,5,B000OPOAMU,"Prepared for release in 2005 we've only had to wait two years for this deluxe reissue of three of the four Leone films included here. For those that want to know this box set has a 32 page booklet with credits and essays on the films but no postcards like the original release of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". If you want the collectable version, I suppose you'll have to buy these individually. This set is definitely worth picking up as it is a HUGE improvement over all the previously released home video versions of the film. All the films look terrific, have commentary tracks (although ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is the exact same release as before)and great featurettes/extras that were released overseas two years ago.

""Fistful of Dollars"" looks very good in its new DVD transfer lovingly restored although there is an odd strobe like effect in one sequence. We get a terrific commentary track from Leone scholar Sir Christopher Frayling discussing the making of the film, the delayed release in the United States (part of which was related to Akira Kurosawa's lawsuit. It was legit though since ""Fistful"" is an unauthorized remake of Kurosawa's classic ""Yojimbo"" although Leone's version of the same story is equally compelling), how Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson (who called it one of the worst scripts he had ever read...interesting considering he later appeared in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"")both turned down the lead role.

Eastwood reveals in a featurette that he wrote much of his own dialogue for the film, made his own script notes all of which contributed to truly making the role his own.

""For a Few Dollars More"" looks exceptional. Like all the films here, it is released in an anamorphic widscreen transfer that does justice to the deep, rich colors of the films. There is one scene where there appears to be some sort of scratch on the film that wasn't corrected but otherwise the film looks beautiful. We also get Eastwood again discussing the making of the film, Sir Christopher Frayling with another very good commentary track as well as a section that compares three variations in the film (the sequence where Manco and Mortimer are beaten up has a slightly longer more brutal variation and we also see the way UA released the film with a brief trim that eliminated Manco's name to tie the film into the promo campagin that UA had for ""The Man with No Name"").

""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is exactly the same as the 2005 release on DVD right down to the graphics on the disc. Sir Christopher Frayling did record a commentary track for this after it was released hoping that it could be added to later editions (he wasn't available for the original remaster. Time critic Richard Schickel does the honors here). The extras are exactly the same. For those that are interested this includes the 5.1 mix that had new sound effects for that mix but does not include the original mono soundtrack in English.

""Duck You Sucker"" comes in the most complete version released so far. At 157 minutes it is closest to Leone's original cut of the film. The film looks exceptionally good. It's clear that John Kirk went the extra mile to get this right. Also, kudos to Glenn Erickson (aka DVD Savant at DVD Talk)who worked on the featurettes and started the campaign to get these films restored and released on home video ages ago.

Again, Sir Christopher Frayling does a very good commentary track discussing the various versions of the film released. The soundtraack has been reprocessed for 5.1. Sergio Donati a collaborator of Leone's discusses working on the film in a featurette and how Eli Wallach was replaced by Rod Steiger at United Artist's insistance but that Leone never shared the information with Wallach. ""Restoration Italian Style"" features John Kirk who worked on this special project discusses how he went about reassembling the film for this edition. We also get location comparisons (this is also on the other discs as well)showing scenes from the film and how the locations look now. ""The Autry Exhibit"" is a featurette on a show assembled by Frayling and Estela Chung for a Leone exhibit. Unfortunately, that happened in 2005 when this was ORIGINALLY was supposed to be released before MGM was bought by Sony throwing this and other releases into limbo. ""Sorting out the Versions"" uses stills, footage used to show us scenes that weren't included in the movie.

The whole set is assembled in a cardboard foldout box with the discs resting on top of each other. There's a little holder built into the set for the booklet.

Overall this is a terrific set and an essential addition to fans of Leone's westerns. Although it took two years to get this released in the United States (that's nothing compared to the delay for the second season of ""Twin Peaks"" for even the release of the pilot for that show in the U.S.), it was worth the wait. I'm not sure what the Blu-Ray plans are for this release yet so I went ahead and plunked down the money for the whole set. Fans who already have ""TGTBATU"" may want to buy these individually although it would be more expensive than this set. MGM (and Fox which distributes all MGM titles now even though MGM is held by Sony)have done a terrific job with this set. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have the collectable postcards that reproduced the lobby cards/posters. Highly recommended.",1181347200,67,5401,4.732199787460149
2798563,5,B000OPOAMU,"I'm glad I didn't dump my copy of the previous ""collectors edition"" of G/B/U when I first pre-ordered this set, because the cool set of postcards reproducing international posters is NOT included in this set.

I've waited 3 years for the other Leone movies to come out on the Collector's Editions...Now I have to decide what to do.

Should I buy the three movies separately or buy the entire box set?  Buying them individually would be cheaper...but will I lose out on anything by doing this and not buying the entire edition?

2798565,5,B000OPOAMU,"Like others in this thread, I too wondered why it took MGM soooo long to put this out.  After seeing the fantastic work with TGBU remastering, I am excited to see what's in store for the rest of these masterpieces.  BTW, in the Editorial Review, Jeff Shannon, as seems to be the case with numerous film critics, incorrectly states about Fistfull of Dollars ""...although Eastwood's character is clearly named ""Joe""..."".  Sure,he is called that but only by one person, the undertaker, in the entire film.  His name was never revealed by his character nor was he referred to by any other name.  I guess one could debate whether or not the undertaker even said ""Joe"" considering that his english dialogue was obviously dubbed.  Oh, well.  Enjoy the new releases!",1180915200,2,758,4.829457364341085
2798566,5,B000OPOAMU,"The word on MGM's higly anticipated ""The Sergio Leone Anthology"" is good; almost nothing bad or ugly to report. The eight-DVD set turns out to be a clone of the design, format and extras from 2004's excellent upgrade of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" That DVD was so good, in fact, MGM didn't change a thing in transporting it into this box set, down to the liner notes design.

All films are restored to their full running times (or as close as possible) and appear in glorious 2:35.1 anamorphic widescreen. They all come in English Dolby 5.1, but see comments below.

""A Fistful of Dollars,"" the first in Italian director Leone's ""Man with no name"" trilogy, looks smashing -- far better than you'd expect for a low-budget pic from 1964. Images and audio are dead-on. If you haven't seen the film for a while, you're in for some serious fun. The film holds up beautifully and young Clint Eastwood's performance is a hoot. Quentin Tarantino calls it ""the best-directed movie of all time.""

The marginally less-successful sequel ""For a Few Dollars More,"" with Lee Van Cleef, exhibits a fair amount of speckling on the otherwise decent color images. The dubbed English stereo audio option proved a bad choice -- voices wandered around the front soundstage for no apparent reason. Leone purists will be listening to the straight-shot mono on these titles, anyway. You might as well join them. [...].

In ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel does the heavy lifting in a commentary that, amazingly, runs on fumes only near the end of three hours. He maintains that Leone's artistry was lost on critics of the 1960s because of the debate over the film's violence (the New York Times pan was titled ""The Burn, the Gouge and the Mangle""). Leone was relatively tame by today's standards, employing ""an enormous amount of foreplay"" before the killings, as in this movie's famous final shootout, Schickel remarks.

MGM's John Kirk covers the audio restoration, a sore spot for Leone purists. Eastwood and Eli Wallach rerecorded their voices in 2002 for the restored scenes, which had never been dubbed. (Everyone on the production just spoke whatever language they spoke.) Another actor stood in for the late Lee Van Cleef

The Anthology also includes the DVD debut of ""Duck, You Sucker,"" a holy grail title for fans. This is the Italian cut of the 1972 Mexican adventure starring Rod Steiger and James Coburn, running at its full length of almost 3 hours.",1180828800,31,2483,4.84433962264151
2798567,5,B000OPOAMU,"When I heard about this, I almost cry like a baby ('swear to God), I was so happy.

I won't buy the boxset (already have ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, like most Sergio Leone fans...), but that won't stop me from buying the rest of them. I don't undertand why it took MGM so long to release this serie properly, but who cares now? It's done! We have it! ENJOY!!!

2798568,5,B000OPOAMU,"This is phenominal...one of the greatest epic series ever concieved in a beautiful boxed set. The box will include Sergio's legendary ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, along with his famous follow-up, 'A Fistful of Dynamite', or, in its uncut state (as it's presented here), 'Duck, You Sucker'. The films are all super-stylish, garnished with Leone's beautiful cinematography (including breath-taking landscapes and painfully up-close-and-personal face shots) and the chilling music of Ennio Morricone. Each of the four films is presented in a 2-disc collecter's DVD format, and each will be the ""director's cut"".

I personally cannot wait. Anyone who wants to rediscover some of the greatest, and the first, spaghetti westerns, or anyone who hasn't yet experienced them, should purchase this set.",1177718400,8,791,5.537190082644628

There is a reason, you haven't seen ""Duck you sucker"" AKA ""a fist full of dynamite"". It was unbelievably terrible and has no relation to the man with no name series.

2798576,4,B000OPOAMU,"The Sergio Leone Anthology contains four of Leone's most famous entries,A Fistful of Dollars(released Sept/64),For a Few Dollars More(released Nov/65),The Good,The Bad and the Ugly(released Dec/66) and finally Duck,you Sucker(released Oct/71).Now let me be clear,I have never been a Western fan at all. When the first two films were released,there were what seemed like an inordinate amount of westerns on TV at that time,such as Bonanza,Gunsmoke,Wagon Train,The Big Valley,The Virginians,and on and on. So when Leone brought out a film out with a man who I already knew from TV as its star,I was more than skeptical. Back then after seeing the  films I was certainly impressed with the freshness and difference of Leone's take on westerns as opposed to Hollywood's product. And as time progressed I realized that it not only put Clint on the map, but also had given him some of the self same character attributes that he would continue to reuse in subsequent films in the years before. My negative impressions in a nutshell?:they were cheaply made(they seemed to get bigger budgets as they progressed),were just WAY too long and the overdubbing resembled something out of a bad Chinese flick. Any ways,let's look at them.
A Fisful of Dollars stars,among others,Clint Eastwood,Marianne Koch and Gian Maria Volont. The story finds Eastwood as a drifter riding into a town with two major factions in it. After the brutality and degrading treatment  some of the town's citizens receive from them,he decides to play the two off of each other. He walks a fine line and even gets beaten for it. But he perseveres and justice is finally meted out. The film has Clint's character taking it cautiously and never using a bit of dialogue he doesn't need to. Violence is not an excuse,it is a way of life here,totally different from Hollywood's films. 3-3 1/2 stars.
For a Few Dollars More stars,among others,Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volont. It finds the same character riding into another town,but this time he has competition. Lee Van Cleef is also front and center and both are bounty hunters going after the same criminal. While Eastwood is in it for profit,Cleef has another personal reason for revenge. This film has virtually the same cast as the previous one,just playing different roles,with the addition of Cleef. I liked the Cleef character and he and Eastwood seemed to play well off of each other. Again the violence is always around every corner just waiting for an excuse to erupt. 3 stars.
The Good,the Bad and the Ugly stars,among others,Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef,Aldo Giuffr,Mario Brega and Eli Wallach. This one finds Eastwood sharing the screen with Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood and Wallach conjure a scheme wherein Eastwood perpetually turns wanted man Wallach in for the reward. Just as he is about to be hung Eastwood shoots the rope and the pair escape and divvy up the money. This scheme soon wears thin and the two part ways. But they continually seem to run into each other and a game of one-upmanship is played out. Cleef is again a bounty hunter and he gets wind of some Confederate gold that is buried somewhere. By coincidence Wallach and Eastwood find the man who buried it. Wallach finds out in what town it is buried, but as he goes for help for the wounded man,he dies. When he returns Eastwood admits to knowing exactly where it is. The three end up at its location near the end and a stand off takes place as to who will get the money. This film,while having the most cred of the series,to me is the least appealing. Its pace and it's bulky and meandering storyline hurt it considerably. Barely 3 stars.
Duck,You Sucker is the Eastwood-less film of the bunch,starring,among others,Rod Steiger,James Coburn and Romolo Valli. This film finds Coburn as an ex IRA man roaming Mexico in the early 1900s,looking for work and carrying one heck of alot of explosives. Steiger is an excitable bandito with a large family in his posse. The two men end up meeting and joining forces to combat the vicious government forces. This is a film about revolution and its effect and consequences on the little man. It was done in a decade(after the 60s social upheaval and into the 70s) that understood that kind of thinking and related to it well. The Mexican revolution was just a back drop for the story. This is a restored version and it certainly makes the original look pale in comparison. The extra footage does nothing but add to it and enhance it so one understands it much better than ever. 3 1/2-4 stars.
Technically speaking the films are all in their original w/s a/r's of 2:35:1 and are incredibly clear and crisp. These films have been remastered so well they look like they were filmed yesterday. The REAL star earners in this set are the invaluable extras. There are eight one sided discs in all,four for the films and four for the extras. The extras range from deleted scenes,featurettes galore,interviews with the films stars,then and now site comparisons,a small booklet and so much more. For a Few Dollars More,The Good,the Bad and the Ugly and Duck,You Sucker have been restored with extra footage. The extra footage for Duck,You Sucker seems to have done it the best out of the two. It just slows down the former,while making the latter much more palpable and easier to understand.
All in all,while groundbreaking films for Eastwood and his future career,the first three films still impress me the same way they did those many years ago;cheap(although admittedly less so as the franchise went on)and overly long with bad overdubbing. They were simply Italian western films that finally made a dent in the North American market. Certainly a different take on the Western genre, but just that,and nothing more. Duck You Sucker is much better now in its full form,and I related to it far better than the others. For those who really dig these films,the extras are the real stars that will spoil even the most passive of viewers,along with the superb remastering. Without having seen the extras(I never do,until AFTER I review),I just know that they will treat these films as something cutting edge and Leone as another Orson Welles;the usual stuff. It is amazing what time does to certain films.",1423353600,,6242,4.871119473189087
2798577,5,B000OPOAMU,"The Sergio Leone Anthology of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY and DUCK, YOU SUCKER is something of an essential release. These were the 4 Sergio Leone ""Spaghetti Western"" films released in the United States by Unite Artists. DUCK, YOU SUCKER is perhaps not a true ""Spaghetti Western"" in the formula of what often and loosely defines the genre, but it definitely belongs here. As we came out of the nineteenth century and entered the next, DUCK, YOU SUCKER is perhaps a result of what came before. Visually, it fits the genre.

What more can be said about these films that has already not been said? On a personal level, I love these films. I saw the trilogy over and over again many times while I was in grade school. Come high school, I loved the genre, but saw it lose popularity by the time I was a senior near graduation. DUCK, YOU SUCKER was released just about the time I graduated. I could see the end was near, but that film touched on many social issues that almost seemed rather timely. Somewhere, when I was a freshman or sophomore I had seen ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Even though that film is not in this set, it haunted me when I saw it and still haunts me to this day. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST also was different from the trilogy. With each film Leone explored the American West and the West below the border with slightly different perspective, yet with a style still familiar. There is always that loneliness of the main characters that seems to remain.

For me, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is the definitive Spaghetti Western. It seems to define it all. Visually it just captures the Spaghetti mythology with its operatic story, music and finale.",1419552000,,1711,4.428571428571429

Once Upon a Time in the West is in my opinion the second greatest western ever made, second only to the Good, the Bad and the Ugly starring Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda. He also made another with Henry Fonda, My Name is Nobody.

My Name is Nobody is every bit as good as the others and should have been included in this anthology instead of Duck, You Sucker as it stars a man with no name too and is a western in the same vein as the Clint Eastwood masterpieces. Terence Hill provides an outstanding performance in My Name is Nobody and is a humorous version of Eastwood's gunslinger and just as fast. While there are many lighthearted scenes it has a solid story and Fonda is his usual superb self. Sergio Leone made the 5 greatest westerns ever bar none.

But everytime I saw them they were overpriced or sold as a two-movie set on one disc.  I'm a huge fan of Amazon and was browsing the westerns one day and came across this gem--for $37.99.

I couldn't pass it up.  Not only do you get the two-disc sets for each Dollars film, you get an extra movie with Duck, You Sucker!  It comes in a nice box set and a collectable booklet.  It's hours of fun you can watch over and over.  It's a steal and I highly recommend picking it up.",1254700800,3,735,4.119718309859155

2798603,4,B000OPOAMU,"I recall as a teen these Spaghetti Western movies were typically shown at Drive-ins and often two at a time. The critics thought they were disgusting and rarely even made more than one sentence derogatory reviews. However, the general public loved them and by the time ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" came out they were shown in any respectable theater. These are by far the best IMHO, and show the range of decent to remarkable. The first two movies are entertaining, but the second two are indeed art of the Spaghetti Western style. ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" does such a great job of showing the 1861-65 West and the Civil War it is like an epic tale. The thing that always stood out to me in the Italian Westerns was the level of detail in setting the era and mood. You will see far more authentic looking items of the period in shops, saloons, and homes on their sets than you will see in many American Westerns. That and Ennio Moriccone's music is fantastic, far better than we have in many American Westerns of course with the exception of ""Magnificent Seven"". I highly recommend this set. Excellent quality DVDs and excellent replayability. If you enjoy these catch ""My Name is Nobody"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".

After 40+ years, we now have complete versions in this anthology - not to mention a lot of background material that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as well.

2798609,5,B000OPOAMU,"You know, when these spaghetti westerns came out, movie critics hated these movies, with a passion. Judith Crist, who was a TV Guide critic, wouldn't even write a complete sentence. Now, the same movies are considered western movie masterpieces. Unfortunately, Sergio Leone isn't alive to hear this about his movies, but fortunately, he already knew that his movies were masterpieces. You know, it's interesting, that many of great directors never won Oscars. Orson Welles, John Ford, even Alfred Hitchcock. It's nice to know, that Sergio Leone is in good company.",1212883200,,564,5.277777777777778
2798610,5,B000OPOAMU,"Among the truly great movie directors, few have a smaller body of work than Sergio Leone.  He really only directed seven movies, and the first of those, The Colossus of Rhodes, is a standard sword-and-sandals flick with little of the true Leone touch.  After that, he would make his mark with five westerns and finish with one of the great gangster films, Once Upon a Time in America.  It is, however, the westerns that Leone really excelled, making some of the best in the genre.  These so-called ""Spaghetti Westerns"" (because they were Italian-made) actually exceed in quality most of the ones made in the U.S.  The Sergio Leone Anthology contains four of these five westerns.

All three of the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy are included.  This is a bit of a misnomer; although all three movies star Clint Eastwood (in roles that would make him a major movie star), he does not play the same character.  In the first film, A Fistful of Dollars, Eastwood plays a mercenary gunfighter who plays both sides in a gang war in a small Mexican town.  A re-make of Yojimbo, this movie was made on a small budget, but already, in the first film in which Leone could truly express himself, he has created a minor masterpiece.  As with all the movies in this set, this film comes with tons of extras including commentaries and behind-the-scenes material; especially amusing is an incompetent attempt by a TV studio to add a prologue to give the movie a bit of moral standing.

The follow-up, For A Few Dollars More, ups the ante by including Lee Van Cleef as a rival bounty hunter whose motives may be more complicated than the mere pursuit of money.  And both Eastwood and Van Cleef would be back for the third ""Trilogy"" movie, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  In my opinion, this may be the best western ever, and I doubt I'm alone (it rates consistently in IMDB's top ten movies).  Eastwood is The Good, Van Cleef is The Bad and Eli Wallach is The Ugly, but good and evil are not really relevant terms here.  It has been said that while in American Westerns, the hero is always the best with his gun, in Leone's Westerns, being the best with your gun makes you the hero, not any moral standing.  The plot deals with the hunt for stolen Confederate gold during the Civil War; and while the previous films also conclude with grand showdowns, this movie has perhaps the best showdown in movie history (probably part of the reason it is one of the best films ever).

What's missing from the set is Once Upon a Time in the West, which rivals The Good, the Bad and The Ugly in quality.  While this missing film deals with the end of the era of the gunfighter and the coming of civilization, the last film in the set, Duck, You Sucker, takes place after that era. Of all Leone's films, this is probably the least watched, and while good, it is bound to be a disappointment to those expecting another western like the earlier ones.  Instead, this one has Rod Steiger as a bandit thief (very similar to Wallach's Tuco in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) who is converted against his will into a revolutionary by explosives expert and ex-IRA member James Coburn.  Despite moments of humor, this is the darkest movie in the set, but also forms something of a thematic transition to the gangster era of Leone's final movie, Once Upon A Time in America.

Although this set suffers from the omission of Once Upon a Time in the West, it is still a great set well worth five stars.  All the movies look great with once-deleted scenes again restored and plenty of extras:  each set has two discs, making this an eight disc set.  Even if you've seen these movies in other formats, you should pick up this set if you enjoy westerns at all.

2798614,5,B000OPOAMU,"And what a long wait it was.  I was probably 16 when I first learned about
Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood.  I was watching TBS's ""Movies for Guys Who Like Movies"" and up popped Fistful of Dollars.  I was hopelessly hooked.

Fast forward to 2007, I was online looking for the trilogy on DVD and saw that a new, remastered, widescreen package of all 4 of these movies was coming out and I had to wait!  Normally I'm a patient person but I was having a hard time with this.  I almost broke down and bought them all separately.  I guess my ""thriftiness"" kept my lack of patience at bay.

I wasn't disappointed, the remastered movies look terrific, the widescreen is long overdue (couldn't stand the pan-and-scan from watching them on TV all these years) the sound is great and the extras are well thought out, informative and entertaining.

Each movie has a separate Special Features disc featuring an interview with film historian Sir Christopher Frayling.  These were so insightful that I found myself watching the movies over again immediately after watching the interviews so that I could pick up on all the history and stylistic elements that he brought to light (great one about the mocking of religious iconography in FFO$... I never picked up on it).

In order to be objective, I should include the only criticism that I had about this set (other than it just took too long to come out) and say that the way the set is physically constructed, you need to remove each movie disc in order to get at it's Special Features counterpart disc.  Hardly a criticism, I know.  This set is just fantastic and if you've been hemming and hawing over the decision to buy it... stop it now and dig out your credit card!",1201132800,2,1709,4.582236842105263

2798616,4,B000OPOAMU,"Really, these Leone movies are all about style, and Leone's vision of a cruel, cruel world, where you win not by being good, but by being tough, and smart, and not so bad that Karma (The Man With No Name) takes notice of you.  Because, once he does, you are finished.  ""Duck, You Sucker"", does not have Eastwood, and was a welcome addition.

It was great to finally have two disc editions of the movies to accompany TGTBTU, and if you cannot take all of this Leone at once, then by all means, spread out the viewing over a reasonable time period.  What's missing from Leone's vision?  The sappy heroes from, say, The Searchers.  Leone's movies have a modern sensibility and humour about them, that is truly timeless.  Why don't I give this 5 stars?  Well, the first two movies in The Man with No Name series, are sometimes a bit weak in plot and structure, and they don't deserve 5 stars, might even deserve just 3, but TGTBTU is one of the best types of it's movie ever made, and as a package, this set is incredible.  You really notice the restoration when you compare the early 1999 dvd releases to these, especially the color correction.

From what I understand, there is a lot of missing footage concerning TGTBTU, and the set has some still shots and story boards of ""The Sorocco Sequence"" that had me wondering if future demand and technology could create those lost scenes, scenes that would add the one element the movie is missing, Eastwood and a woman, together, and the small desert town interlude that finds them together, before the reckonings to come.

On a much, much brighter note, it's also an important date for all spaghetti western buffs. Today is the *30th* anniversary of the *only* airing (mercifully!!) of the infamous prologue to 'Fistful' before it's network TV premiere.

The prologue itself is 4:46 in length and stars Harry Dean Stanton and an obviously-waaaaaaay-too-short stunt double in place of Clint. It was shot on what looks like a budget of 10 pesos in one of my fave places in all of Mexico, Cuernavaca (the capital of the Mexican state of Morelos).

Why the need for such a prologue you ask? Very simply, network TV censorship at the time didn't allow such 'immoral' violence to air without some sort of explanation for it.
