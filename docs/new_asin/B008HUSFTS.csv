I'll hawk my few season sets and get ready for the complete series...

Thank you Shout Factory!",1341792000,8,129,4.333333333333333
5165204,5,B008HUSFTS,Very good show. A few yelling scenes that were silly. But the characters are endearing. Shines light on predjudice in amusing way. Disk 1 was actually season 4. All other disks were fine.,1522454400,,187,4.696969696969697
5165205,5,B008HUSFTS,What can I say about this show I grew up on this sitcom I love it!!! Its just funny,1521676800,,83,3.4210526315789473
5165206,5,B008HUSFTS,Excellent Quality! Arrived as scheduled! Great Dealer! Thank You!,1521504000,,65,6.333333333333333

5165208,5,B008HUSFTS,"The descriptions by some of the other reviewers of picture quality is understandable. My copies are only slightly problematic. Growing up in the pre cable and pre HD days this problem is less for me. I wonder what the master tapes looked like when they were transferred to DVD. There's little that can be done if the original source is flawed badly. I'm just grateful to have this collection, been waiting a long time.

I think 'All In The Family' is the best and most influential sit com ever. Norman Lear was a genius when he borrowed this show from the Brits. The cast is top notch. The show touched on a wide variety of topics which had not been handled in this way previously. Racism/race relations, sexuality and questioning the patriarchy were topics which were a hot topic then as they are now. The more things change the more they stay the same? Could this show be broadcast in today's PC culture? I doubt it. Thankfully we can see this series uncut in all it's non PC splendor. Brilliant cast, writing and production that stands the test of time. Very highly recommended.",1520812800,,1081,4.601036269430052

5165215,3,B008HUSFTS,"For years I've been wanting to get the box set, and I finally got it and couldn't wait to watch it.
And I've watched the first season so far.
The problem is, the quality of the picture is kinda grainy and the color is awful!  I bought it expecting the opposite.  Don't buy till it's blue ray!  Seriously, totally unacceptable!!!",1513814400,,328,4.433333333333334
5165216,4,B008HUSFTS,"Having grown up with parents in the South who loved All in the Family, but for the wrong reasons, I only knew of the series through occasional reruns.  But seeing the whole series made me appreciate how predictive it was of the cultural wars currently raging.  Not sure whether DVD format is useful anymore, but thankful that this issue is available.",1512518400,,350,4.721311475409836

5165224,4,B008HUSFTS,Good deal,1497052800,,9,4.0
5165225,5,B008HUSFTS,"This is one of the best sitcoms of all time. Archie Bunker could easily have been played as a one-dimensional bigot in a forgettable show, but Carroll O'Connor gives him a humanity that makes us want to see him do better as he becomes wiser with experience. Jean Stapleton is equally fine as Archie's naive, good-hearted wife Edith.  The comedy pokes gentle fun not only at the prejudices of Archie, but the moral vanity of his freeloading liberal daughter Gloria and her grad student husband Mike, who are forgettably played by Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner.",1496448000,,560,4.833333333333333

5165231,5,B008HUSFTS,"I now have one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, the groundbreaking ALL IN THE FAMILY.  I am very impressed with the seller, it came in a timely manner, and no damage whatsoever.  upon opening the package, I went to the enclosed booklet, very informative. There is a lot of history written about the show, as well as the listing of every season and episode ever made. This set also includes extras, such as the spin-offs, GLORIA, ARCHIE BUNKER'S PLACE AND 704 HAUSER ST.  Don't be a Meathead, Get this set.

Next......MAUDE!",1493942400,10,527,4.634408602150538
5165232,4,B008HUSFTS,"I love 70s sitcom's, and ""All in the Family"" is one of the best.  Outside of ""M.A.S.H."", it's one of my favorites.  Carol O'Connor  as ""Archie Bunker"", is an exceptional actor, and creator writer and director Norman Lear, shaped American culture by showing it's darker side through humor.  Surprisingly, some of the same social issues that were broadcasted in 1970's, are still being grappled with today making this comedy series as relevant today as when it aired. This complete DVD set of the series has been a pleasure to watch again, and again.",1493078400,2,548,4.860215053763441
5165233,2,B008HUSFTS,"The box set arrived quickly and in great condition, and I got it at a reduced price! Sadly Season 2 disks 1 and 2 didn't play correctly and there was an obvious scratch on both. It's a shame because I enjoyed the first few discs without issue. I was disappointed that I had to return the item.",1492560000,3,293,4.157894736842105

5165235,2,B008HUSFTS,"I LOVE All in the Family. But, am disappointed with the quality of these DVDs. Some episodes have lines running through them, others have discolorations. There are also some FORCED solicitations at the start of some of them. I really don't want to sit through preview after preview after preview (unable to fast forward through) of other series available through Shout. Honestly, I don't think they should be included, at all. But, if they are, you SHOULD be able to FF through them. I didn't make the purchase to be forced into watching advertising - especially when the quality of what I have is not good.",1490227200,30,607,4.735849056603773

5165238,5,B008HUSFTS,"I had forgotten how well done these episodes were.  Things have changed a lot and situations that were shocking then are acceptable now.  Still, the occurrences; actors timing; and dialogue are hilarious.  Some situation comedies have not aged well, but having lived in Archie Bunkers time I love these iconic episodes.  I can't imagine that later generations would find them so amusing.",1487980800,3,387,5.193548387096774

5165243,5,B008HUSFTS,"If anyone in a younger generation is looking for a history lesson in peoples biased attitudes about race, women's rights, etc.,  All In The Family was so well done and totally relevant to what is happening now in America.

5165254,1,B008HUSFTS,"Ripoff!!!  First disc (seasons 1 and 2) had the closed caption feature.  The other 4 discs on the 5 disc set DID NOT!  Fine if your hearing is good.  Mine wasn't then.  Sent the first set back with the complaint.  They (SHOUT) replaced it but with exactly the same set with the same problem.  I love the series and just turned the volume up in order to watch the last 4 discs.  Here we are in 2017, and my hearing is even worse now while I watch the series again..

5165262,5,B008HUSFTS,"The quality of the show is fine, its just that they were not recorded in HD since it was filmed 40 years ago. I like that it shows the whole show, and is not cut at all like the reruns are on TV. I LOVE watching it, it brings me back to my childhood, and the subjects are just as relevant today as they were then. Things haven't changed much. It remains a great series, and I recommend it highly. I am so happy I bought it. Worth every penny.",1481414400,12,442,3.922222222222222

5165272,1,B008HUSFTS,First let me say I love this show. It was groundbreaking at the time. And I still love it today I was so excited about getting this set. But after watching the first few DVDs the picture quality is worse than a VHS. There are little colors in the corners. The sound quality is poor as well. I forked over $100 for this. And have never been more disappointed in a box set. I don't understand all these reviews. You will be very disappointed if you buy this for $100. You will be very disappointed if you bought it for $25. Butt I still get to watch them even if the quality is terrible I will still enjoy them. But take my word do not buy this particular box set,1475539200,21,661,4.092307692307692
5165273,5,B008HUSFTS,"I had forgotten what aground breaking show this was.  Through comedy, they unmasked all of the prejudices that the times were prevalent. I believe that thoughtful people recognized the ultimate message of the show, and tried to overcome some of their own prejudices that they didn't realize that they had.  Nevertheless, it was the comedic talents of the cast that had us in our seats on a weekly basis to watch this show.  I'm happy to own the entire series.",1473379200,,459,4.7125

5165279,3,B008HUSFTS,"hi there

i bought the all in the family the complete series 28 disc set on dvd.

i have some info on it. make sure you check each and every disc in this set.
because the cases for the discs are so tight and fully packed together the disc might get cracked.

i bought mine on ebay for $48.00 and i saw alot of things wrong with this set. i think i defect set.

out of 28 discs i saw that 6 discs were cracked so bad i could not watch thoese discs.
the episode book that came with the set i saw that it was cut poorley. all the pages were off key and off center. it looked like the book was homemade. so i think it was a bootleg copy. of the whole set.

i going to buy another set and put the discs in a better 6 disc holder that won't be so tight to get the discs out.

i hope the 2nd copy is better.",1466553600,,800,3.7041420118343193

Outstanding acting along with superb writing are just a few of the reasons this show has stood the test of time. A show like this could never be produced in todays world of political correctness. When you cant parody the things that are wrong or cause tension within society, society tends to let the tension turn into anger and that in turn can boil over into violence.

They Crammed alot of Episodes on One Single Layer DVD
You have Pixallation and Pixel Flashing During Slow Scenes Due To Low Bitrate Used On DVD

5165299,4,B008HUSFTS,"I was 5 years old when this show first aired. I have fond memories of watching it with my parents, and laughing when they laughed even though as a child much of the humor flew right over my head. Having made the purchase I can say this show stands up to the test of time, it's as funny today as it was in the 70s, and all while often tackling sensitive subjects that pushed the censors to their limits for that time. The timing, the chemistry between the cast, all of it was just perfect. You'll laugh, you'll cry. The earliest seasons were the best. Later on things started to go downhill. I would rate the first 6 seasons as 5 stars, season 7 as 4 stars and seasons 8+9 as 3 stars so I split the difference and gave it a 4. After Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers left it just was not the same without them around to antagonize poor Archie and once ""Steffie"" showed up they really should have just packed it in.

5165312,5,B008HUSFTS,"What can I say...it's a classic which never fails to deliver on highlighting the ignorance and idiocy of bigotry; sexism; and racism during one of the most tumultuous decades in American history...it was a brave format to take on these issues in a comedic format, as the point was lost on many. However, for someone who sees that these prejudices sadly still prevail - what an awesome job at making fun of the people who espouse them.",1453939200,,434,4.64935064935065

I really like how they managed to include social issues that took place when this show was on the air.

5165343,5,B008HUSFTS,"Great series . So glad I finally caved and bought it. Forgot about the U.S. exchange and paid an obscene price for it. Should have gotten it through Amazon.ca. My own fault.

5165356,4,B008HUSFTS,Made it.,1437177600,,8,3.5
5165357,2,B008HUSFTS,"Was looking forward to watching this classic...I bought the complete series..and so far at least 3 disks about half way through starts to mess up and you can not watch the remaining episodes on the disk.  VERY mad especially with the birth of Mike and Gloria's baby messing up and can not watch those episodes....the others that started messing up was the disk containing the 100th episode with Henry Fonda narrating it,...can't watch it...and then xmas episode where Edith finds a lump in her breast.  Very disappointing so far with some of the episodes I really wanted to watch, I can not see them.  so..I was generous with my 2 stars.",1436832000,4,637,4.7207207207207205

5165362,5,B008HUSFTS,One of the finest TV series ever on the air.  Bargain price!  No commercials is a blessing too!,1435968000,,95,4.222222222222222
5165363,5,B008HUSFTS,"Looks great, sounds great.",1435881600,,26,5.75
5165364,4,B008HUSFTS,"Its easy (and impressive) to see why this sit-com was so revolutionary for its time.  In 1971 Issues like racism, homosexuality, the Vietnam war were rarely dealt with in even the bravest network dramas, much less comedy.  TV was a place where the real issues and real problems that effected real people didn't seem to exist.  In creating a main character who was a paradoxically lovable if terribly foolish bigot, creator Norman Lear crossed into dicey, politically incorrect territory that was shocking at the time.  It was also helped by that fact that both Caroll OConnor as the bigoted working class Archie and Jean Stapleton as his ever optimistic, good hearted, but not very bright wife managed to turn these potential cartoons into very human characters, simultaneously absurd, but still real enough that they reminded you of those relatives you inevitably cringed through Thanksgiving with.

On the other hand, the series has dated as time has moved on.  The lessons, often about complex social issues, still have to be summed up in a brief 24 minutes of show time, the supporting and guest actors didn't always rise to the level of OConnor and Stapleton, and elements do get repetitive quickly, especially in the era of binge watching multiple episodes in a single sitting.  For example, the pretty generic and predictable political arguments between right-wing Archie and his left-wing son in law (Rob Reiner) get old by the 3rd or 4th one in a sitting.

To those who grew up more recently, it may be hard to grasp why this show was such a huge deal.  And for those of us who grew up watching it,  time has dulled its punch a bit.  But theres no question that it changed TV and American popular culture forever, and deserves its reputation based on that.",1435708800,,1765,4.811258278145695
5165365,5,B008HUSFTS,This was my husbands favorite t-v show. He is so thrilled with it. It's going to take a long time to watch them all but he sits and laughs every day. I couldn't have gotten him a better Father's  Day gift. After all these years they still are very funny.,1435536000,,254,4.08
5165366,5,B008HUSFTS,"Watched this as a kid and brought back lots of good, fun memories. Although controversial at times, the banter is fantastic from all sides. This show, like the Honeymooners, the Odd Couple and so on can never be duplicated.",1435017600,,223,4.743589743589744
5165367,2,B008HUSFTS,"The show is top notch and deserves five stars. The quality of the graphics deserves zero stars. This is what I'd expect to receive if I had purchased the set on VHS tapes. Why has not one Amazon reviewer mentioned this? I have a 40-inch wide screen TV. The picture quality is utterly disappointing, faded and blurry, strange tint and washed out color...just like a used VHS tape purchased at a garage sale. It isn't worth the $118 price tag. (I know the technology is available to enhance the picture. The Columbo series starring Peter Falk is absolute top notch in crystal clarity.)

All in the Family deserved much better attention than what it received.",1434931200,7,656,4.7043478260869565

5165369,5,B008HUSFTS,"All In The Family is one of the all-time greatest television series ever to be put on the air.  One could not ask for better acting than one gets from the four main cast members, Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers.  The writing is of the highest quality.  Not only is it an extremely funny show, but it is also intelligent, insightful and thought-provoking.  It could be argued that it is the greatest sitcom to ever air.  The episode with Sammy Davis, Jr. alone makes it worth the price I paid for it, and truth be told all of the episodes are magnificent.  Way to go, Norman Lear!",1434412800,,612,4.468468468468468

5165375,3,B008HUSFTS,"The storage cases are all broken up inside. The discs slide around inside, getting scratched as a result.

As a child, I remember my dad watching this show. I did not like it. As an adult, I can appreciate the humor when Archie says one word, meaning another and all of Archie's misconceptions. I also find it funny that America was so absorbed by hearing the flush of a toilet.

It's an interesting show and definitely not for everyone's taste. I watch it, but mostly for the memories of my dad. He picked up many of Archie's facial expressions so it's fun for me to watch.",1431734400,5,574,4.40566037735849

5165423,4,B008HUSFTS,"There appear to be a number of versions and copies out there. This review is specifically about the Shout Factory distribution of the complete series on DVD with the UPC in the title. I'm not going to review the series because you wouldn't be looking if you weren't already familiar with the TV show and reviews, IMHO, aren't supposed to be about delivery service, Amazon. etc. That stuff should be left to eBay. So, the review is about the product being sold: Do you want to buy this product? (we'll assume everyone does their job because it is expected and I received exactly the service I expected).

The DVD set I received is packaged fairly nicely in five plastic holders with six DVDs in each holder. The DVDs are double layer (8Gb disks) holding four episodes each. The quality of the video is poor to good. It is about what you'd expect if you VHS taped an original episode over normal airwaves. There is, of course, no commercials, no static, etc. but the quality is out done by even the cheapest video on cell phones today. If you are looking at the Amazon page, there is a ""play"" button of an episode that will show. It is a perfect example of what you will see. Some episodes are a little worse around the edges as the picture flares, blures and contains bleed from the video tapes. So, do not expect a tremendous improvement over what you see on cable at TVLand and such. These are not high quality copies and certainly not high definition, or even clear pictures. The sound is excellent. In fact, Edith's voice is very clear and sounds more like Jean Stapleton than what I normally get over TV. The episodes do carry small scene additions that make it slightly different than what may have been aired where you originally saw this, but it is good stuff. There is not a lot of additional material, it is all described on the exterior of the package and there are no commentary reels, gag reels, outtakes, etc. For a fan of the show who has nothing except this, you will be thrilled to have a good, clear copy of this ground-breaking series that guided much of the future of television. If you already have anything, VHS, single seasons or other compilations, this package will not improve what you have. Stick with it unless you hear about someone doing a re-master. I don't believe this was ever shot on film, so it is limited by the quality of videotape used to shoot the original series. Some computer software could clean it up a bit, but until you hear of that happening, this package isn't a ""great"" copy. Enjoy what you have. It gets four stars because  it fulfilled all my expectations, added some extra bits not aired in Detroit Michigan, has some nice extras on the last disk and comes with a nice booklet with a couple nice articles and a description of the episodes (nothing you can't get on Wikipedia or IMDB). If you are looking to get started with this series, you'll enjoy this package. It was $103.88 when I bought it and that was what won me over, a really great price.",1414368000,19,3000,4.502752293577982
5165424,4,B008HUSFTS,"...is how it shows the way partisan politics can warp the viewpoints of people to where they focus on their biases rather than looking at each other as PEOPLE. Archie of course was the ""bad guy"" to people like me when the series was in first-run. Norman Lear must have built him as a composite of every older acquaintance who he ever argued with in real life. Edith was a neutral, there to maintain a low profile. Mike and Gloria were the ""good guys"". Never mind that when I saw reruns in syndication, I wondered why I'd looked at them that way. Back in ""The Day"", I wore my hair as long as Mike's, as well as a mustache. So Mike was ""on my team"" by default. Never mind that he was a holier-than-thou knowitall who lived with his father-in-law because he let his wife support him. We all thought Gloria was hot, never mind that despite being the real breadwinner of the couple, she was a very immature woman. Seeing Sally Struthers' tearful performance in charity-based ads since then gave me the suspicion that Norman Lear typecast her.",1413417600,,1037,4.492063492063492

Now that I am a little older, I decided to check it out again and found this amazing set at what I believe was an absolute steal! (Watch the price as it fluctuates from $75.00 to $200.00)

With this set, I had something to watch from November of 2013 until today, the first of September 2014. It is truly an incredible show with a perfect balance of humor, real life issues, and subjects that wouldn't be touched in today's PC world. The bonus disc that they included is ALMOST perfect. The only change I would make is to remove 704 Hauser and replace it with the Edith's Death episode of Archie Bunker's Place (Season 2).

Otherwise, this wonderfully packaged and detailed set is worth every penny and then some! This is a must own for any fan, whether die hard or on the fence!",1409529600,5,934,4.482352941176471

5165445,5,B008HUSFTS,"Sure is nice to see Archie and the rest again after all these years. When it originally aired I didn't get to see the earlier episodes. They don't seem to come up in syndication for some reason. Strange as it may seem, the sound of a toilet flushing on television was pushing the boundaries at the time. Norman Lear pushed a lot of boundaries back then. I doubt that Archie Bunker's language would be allowed on national prime time TV today.

For a show that was recorded on videotape, the picture quality is quite good. There are some instances of blooming in early episodes; Archie's white shirt for example, or a reflective object leaving a trail on screen but that doesn't take away from the pure enjoyment of revisiting a time in American TV history when everyone on the show reminded us of someone we knew.",1409097600,4,812,4.561643835616438

5165449,5,B008HUSFTS,"I only watched this series intermittently during the seventies so I am now reliving all the topical comedy of the time, at my own pace, in this terrific 28 disc boxed set.  Norman Lear's groundbreaking  series holds up exceptionally well with solid writing and direction but best of all the show is blessed with a flawless cast.  I recently read Carroll O'Connor's autobiography  which I thoroughly enjoyed and gave me a better appreciation of the man and his Archie Bunker character.  Personally I would watch the series just for Jean Stapleton - simply outstanding as Edith.
One of the issues I had when growing up in Australia, was that we were saturated with the BBC-TV series ""Till Death Us Do Part"", the Johnny Speight comedy series and original source of  ""All in the Family"" and starring  Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett who  was not quite as likeable as Archie.  So many of us had a bit of a jaundiced view when the American series hit our television screens.

The stand out episodes include the one about the Jeffersons moving into the neighborhood, the drop-in of Sammy Davis, Jr. (which I regard as one of the best written episodes in the history of the sitcom), the episode about the so-called ""draft dodger"" who returns from Canada for a clandestine visit, and Edith's momentary loss of religious faith when her cross-dressing friend is murdered during what may be network television's first gay bashing.

5165524,2,B008HUSFTS,"This show, while at times endearing, did arguably more to advance the cause of nineteen sixties radicalism in this country than any movement or group ever organized expressly for that purpose.  Carole O'Connor brings great humor and irony to his inimitable portrayal of the character of Archie Bunker, yet , when one considers how morally corrupt and rootless American culture has become in the last forty years, entertainment value hardly suffices to redeem this corrosive little farce.  What is truly astonishing is the thoroughgoing way in which Michael's ""pinko"" political and social views, once regarded as fringe or even dangerous, have become de rigueur for virtually every mainstream intellectual and cultural figure of the last twenty years. It goes without saying that the public, in lock-step, has quickly and dutifully followed suit in amending its ""incorrect"" opinions in accordance with the new piety, whose vile stench, sadly, now permeates every aspect of modern life. The transformation is so very complete, in fact, that it is difficult to find a single controversial issue of national importance today, the discussion of which has not been thoroughly shaped by the sensibilities of people who championed beliefs and values that are for all intents and purposes identical to those epitomized by Archie's beloved ""Meathead"". The tragic tale of this sea change has been compellingly documented by writers like Richard Kimball and the late Robert Bork, whose works I commend to all thoughtful readers.

I can't, however, help but wonder just how well Michael's leftist claptrap would have fared as a credible foil to the ""conservative"" viewpoint personified by Archie--in crassly caricatured form of course--had his canned wit been forced to contend with something even slightly more formidable than the artlessly uniform procession of platitudes and straw men marshaled by the writers in lampooning the ideals and values of a culture for which they quite obviously feel little more than contempt.

I suppose one could argue that the whole point of the unflattering juxtaposition was to underscore the lack of mutual understanding which prevailed in the emerging conflict between the older reactionary generation and that of the rising post-war spawn, though even in this case the dishonesty and tasteless ridicule employed by the writers in communicating their point of view is less than admirable.  Nevertheless, we unreconstructed conservatives still have much cause to take heart: As the unforeseen consequences that invariably attend stupidity of the more persuasive variety have, with the passing of time, a tendency only to make the sources of their error all the more conspicuously and bitterly felt, society has historically shown an uncanny capacity for healthy critique and self-correction.  Which is to say, as our culture continues its steady decline under the weight of the toxic ideological forces unleashed by Meathead and his ilk, conservatism in America has nowhere to go but UP!",1392940800,11,3012,5.370762711864407

5165545,5,B008HUSFTS,This set takes longer than the given time to leave feed back. It has been wonderful and anyone like myself that has never seen this program will enjoy this set.

Great if you want your kids to learn what right and wrong are by seeing other people who never give a chance to others with there own unjust morality. I have laughed and cried with these episodes and any one who has a tender heart like me and is hurt by people who never think you do the right thing learns from these people and there incorrect ways. I see each and every member of my family here and I never thought that I would ever see that on a TV show like this. It was great  only wish I could point it out to them.

I started buying the DVD sets which made me pretty happy until they got to the 6th season then stopped. I was so man. In came Shout! factory which saved the show from it's lazy predecessor Sony Picture Home Entertainment. Soon after the release of the ninth and final season word had spread like wildfire about a re-release of the whole entire series Shout put in motion. At first I was a little leery of it but then I started looking at the packaging on line. I started noticing that each disc set actually has two seasons in each which makes each disc set a 6 disc set. As soon as I saw that I hit that ""add to cart"" button faster than you could turn your head. I got rid of my old copies. The reason for my excitement was this complete series set actually saves you room on you shelve and it sure did for me.

My husband and I enjoyed Archie's angst and facial expressions when Edith, Mike, and Gloria called him on the carpet for being an opinionated, loudmouthed bigot.

5165621,5,B008HUSFTS,"I am heartbroken that Jean Stapleton passed away yesterday; I was dreading the day when I would have to read about it in the news. Stapleton, as is the case with all the other actors in All in the Family, performed brilliantly and delivered a type of comedy that was groundbreaking and not afraid to thumb its nose at conventional wisdom about what could be seen on TV. Of course, look for Carroll O'Connor as the unforgettable Archie Bunker who, despite his obvious bigotry, gradually developed into a loving and caring man who had more compassion in his heart than we initially thought--great character development! Rob Reiner played Michael ""Meathead"" Stivic who was married to their Bunkers' daughter Gloria played by Sally Struthers.  In addition, all through these DVDs the quality of the sound and the image is really quite good. The sight gags and laughs still hold up, too.

There are many wonderful episodes of All in the Family, so many that it's practically impossible for me to pick just one and call it my favorite! I will never forget the episode in which Sammy Davis, Jr. comes to visit the Bunker household to retrieve his briefcase after losing it in Archie's taxi cab; this episode couldn't have been done any better and the very last second or two showed a gag Davis played on the whole crew without any advance notice! The way the audience roared proved again this was a special television sitcom far above the ordinary in terms of quality. Other fantastic episodes that come to mind at an instant include the one in which Edith's cousin Maude (Beatrice Arthur) comes to visit when Edith and the rest of the family are ill; the time when a computer (!) accidentally marks a hole in a punch card indicating that Archie is deceased; the two-part episode when Gloria gives birth to a baby boy named Joey (not to mention how Archie handles the whole thing when Mike and Gloria don't want baby Joey baptized); the episodes that deal with homophobia; episodes that feature the Jeffersons, an African-American family living right next door to the Bunker household--and so many more!

Of course, there are bonus features. The ones I particularly like are the new interview with Norman Lear; the documentary entitled ""Those Were The Days: The Birth Of `All In The Family';"" the other documentary entitled ""The Television Revolution Begins: `All In The Family' Is On The Air"" and the book with essays by Tom Shales and Marty Kaplan.

I highly recommend this DVD set for fans of the principal actors in All in The Family; fans of the actors portraying others like The Jeffersons and Stephanie Mills (played by Danielle Brisebois) would do well to get this, too. In addition, people who appreciate groundbreaking sitcoms with frequently timeless jokes, sight gags and top-notch comedy will not be disappointed.",1370044800,98,2819,4.854469854469855

Although, by todays standards it may be seem a bit raciest and politically incorrect. The writer's always covered their tracks allowing the Mike and Gloria characters to play devil's advocate to Archie's opinions which help soften the blow.  And yes, Edith is a dingbat which makes her hilarious. If you are under the age of 30 and don't have an old soul, you may have a hard time with the humor and subject matter because it's not trending on social media.  For everyone else, buy it.

So now with this set we get to relax and watch with no ads which makes the price of the set worth it by itself. All In The Family...UNEDITED! Now I don't have to watch ads about catheters and canes on Antenna TV anymore.

Picture quality is just like it's always been and so is the sound which is fine. The extras are OK as we get the original pilots (wow the actors who originally played Mike & Gloria, were they awful or what?) and a few documentaries. The docs were good for what they were but being only 10 and 15 minutes in length don't really add much to the set. A show like this deserves a full 60 minute to 2 hour documentary in my opinion. Even just adding the E True Hollywood story special would have been better.

Finally a note to those who write a review just to complain about the price. First, this is not the place for that as you are supposed to review the product, not complain that it cost too much. Secondly most regular Amazon customers know it's standard practice for Amazon to slash the price on a product and then raise it back a short while later.

5165718,5,B008HUSFTS,"NOTE: I am a TV on DVD reviewer and am basing this review on the actual advance set that I received, rather than speculation regarding its content. This review is from my site, which is at classictvdvdreviews.blogspot.com.

I would also like to say that I understand that many people bought the individual seasons and are now upset about having to buy the complete series set to get the exceptional extras. I have been in that boat many times.

My first reaction is to say ""Stifle Dingbat."" My second reaction is to recommend giving your current sets to friends and relatives, selling them at used DVD store, or just deciding if the extras are worth having a duplicate set of the episodes.

Shout Factory's awesome track record with complete series DVD sets of classic shows continues with its above-average even for Shout collection of every episode from ""All in the Family's"" nine seasons.

Aside from the terrific accompanying booklet and special features that are discussed below, the DVD set earns an A+ for including the original broadcast versions of the episodes.

The syndicated episodes always seemed oddly short and missing something. I also did not understand why I liked the DVD episodes so much better than the TV Land presentations until learning that the syndicated versions cut between four and five minutes from the original broadcasts. Well done Shout!

The premise of ""Family"" is highly original and has not been repeated since its mid-season 1971 premiere. It centers around the Queens, NY home that blue-collar working stiff Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor, shares with his textbook adoring and long-suffering wife with a breaking point Edith, played by Jean Stapleton.

The Bunkers' naive but slowly evolving 20-something daughter Gloria, played by Sally Struthers, and her liberal college student husband Mike Stivic, played by later film director/producer Rob Reiner, reside with the 'rents for the first few seasons but stay close-by for a few more years.

Anyone who is familiar with ""Family"" is aware that father rarely, if ever, knew best in that household and that the post-adolescent kids were hardly the freshly-scrubbed clean-cut Disneyfied Kurt Russell et al college student type of the early 1970s.

Additionally, Edith probably did not own a real pearl necklace and seemed dazed and confused much more frequently than wise and motherly.

This realism extended to the characters bickering and facing serious health and financial difficulties much more often than outwardly expressing their love for each other and planning elaborate surprise parties or fretting over a dinner for the boss going awry.

It is especially noteworthy that ""Family"" premiered roughly 15 years before Roseanne asserted to all within earshot of her boisterous bellowing that she had created the first show that accurately depicted blue-collar (and American) life.

With the appropriate degree of  respect to Ms. Arnold, I have had relatives and close family friends deal with the ""Family"" issues of rape, substance abuse, miscarriages, housing and job discrimination, marital fidelity, homophobia, and many other challenges.

I have never known of anyone to deal with the ""Roseanne"" issues of one daughter barking in class, another daughter being humiliated because she broke wind in front of the entire school, or a husband and wife pulling elaborate Halloween pranks on each other. I additionally could never imagine the ""Family"" cast ever agreeing to perform a parody of a classic sitcom as the ""Roseanne"" gang did a few times.

""Family's"" impact also extended to providing the American viewing public almost as jarring a wake up call as the footage from Vietnam that aired on the evening news during the same era.

CBS went directly from its rural comedies, such as the ""The Beverly Hillbillies/""Hooterville series and ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Gomer Pyle: USMC,"" and other wacky sitcoms such as ""The Doris Day Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" to the grittier and all around darker (but still hilarious) ""Family.""

""Family"" being the first series to depict a flushing toilet is an oft-cited example of how that show put the mirror on us as much as the depiction of the Louds in the PBS 1973 documentary ""An American Life."" In fact, the Louds could have been the Bunkers if they belonged to a much lower economic class.

It is further doubtful that CBS would have aired the thinly disguised Vietnam War comedy ""M*A*S*H"" in September 1972 if ""Family"" had not succeeded.

On a lighter note, purely comedic elements of ""Family"" made it as a memorable as Archie's ignorance-based prejudicial views, the heated Watergate-era political discussions, and the frank depictions of the ups and regular downs following those happy days that most of us experience.

Archie calling Edith ""Dingbat"" and telling her to stifle as regularly as he called Mike ""Meathead"" still makes every fan smile.

A personal favorite schtick involves Edith telling a story as long and rambling as this review of the ""Family"" complete series set. Archie would soon perfectly pantomime setting up an ultimately executed suicide while suffering through Edith's tale. A faux lynching that ended up with Archie's head rolling to the side and his tongue hanging out his mouth was the best of the lot.

Because most of ""Family's"" more than 200 episodes were excellent, and even some not-so-great ones from later seasons were not so bad, picking a standout one is tough.

The two-parter in which Gloria gives birth is one of the more memorable ones for being particularly good at combining physical humor in the form of her getting stuck in a telephone booth, social issues in the form of controversy regarding Archie performing in a minstrel show, and one fall on the floor funny sight gag at the hospital that is too good to ruin with advance notice.

The aforementioned booklet, which includes great episode synopses, has essays by ""Family"" expert Marty Kaplan and legendary veteran TV critic Tom Shales on the history and impact of ""Family."" The struggle to fine tune the show just right, get a network to air it, and the impact that it had make that topic a very worthy  feature film topic. Perhaps Rob Reiner will produce one.

The best of a wonderful gaggle of DVD extras is a brand-new interview with ""Family"" creator and producer Norman ""TV God"" Lear. I had always admired Lear, but this interview earned him a place on my list of people with whom I would like to share a corned beef on rye at a Brooklyn deli.

Lear clearly, eloquently, and candidly spoke of every aspect of creating the show. The insights that he shared included basing Archie on Lear's father and O'Connor basing his depiction of that character on a cab driver that O'Connor knew.

Lear further made my day in verifying my theory that each ""Family"" episode was produced as a two-act theatrical presentation. Although Lear kept most of the action in the Bunkers' living room, he was a genius at having the world enter that space.

Other ""behind-the-scenes"" features included segments from the show and clips of prior interviews with cast members. The contrast between a tiny and adorable Sally Struthers from ""Family's"" early days and her horrible mug shot of shame regarding her recent DUI arrest in Maine was genuinely sad.

Readers know that I am often the first to mock aging sitcom stars who face public disgrace. In this case, Struthers has shown me great kindness during her summers in Maine. I hope that things work out for her and that the public cuts this genuinely nice lady a break.

The three cherries on the addictive treat that is the ""Family"" complete series set are the pilot episodes of the ""Family"" spinoffs ""Gloria,"" ""Archie Bunker's Place,"" and ""704 Hauser Street."" Of the three, only ""Place"" achieved any success.

I liked ""Gloria"" better as a kid than I did the other night. The elderly rural vet, played by Burgess ""The Penguin"" Meredith, for whom Gloria went to work was the only character who displayed much personality. It was also odd to see a ""Family"" inspired show be more ""Green Acres"" than ""Meet the Press.""

""Archie Bunker's Place"" was a decent show that  ran for a few years, and had an episode that is incredibly sad for ""Family"" fans. The problem was that the show was more ""The Ropers"" than ""Frasier."" Like ""The Ropers,"" the main character did not work as well when taken even slightly out of his element.

As Lear and legions of fans have realized, the ""Family"" cast understood their characters and those characters' relationships with each other better than virtually any other cast.

""704 Hauser Street"" was a short-lived series in which Lear had a black family live in the Bunkers' former house and have the same type of political discussions. Unfortunately, lightning did not strike twice.

At the same time, the three pilots are interesting nostalgia that are worth watching.

Anyone with thoughts or questions regarding ""Family"" is encouraged to email me.",1349395200,123,8956,5.0020188425302825
5165719,1,B008HUSFTS,"I purchased all six seasons of AITF from Sony during 2003-2006 and was thrilled when it was announced Shout Factory would pick up where Sony left off by releasing Seasons 7-9 in 2010-2011. Even though Seasons 7 and 9 were not the greatest I wanted to support Shout because they've brought many favorites to DVD the last five years--I bought them all. The studios trick us by saying ""If you want more seasons, make sure you keep buying"" then pull a stunt like this.

My beef with this set is that it contains many bonus features not found anywhere else and those features will NOT be made available to those of us who supported their product by buying the individual seasons. I would gladly buy the bonuses on a separate disc, but no--I'm expected to go to the trouble of unloading my previous 9 season sets and rebuy everything to get the bonus material. This practice is pure greed and now Shout Factory have stooped to the level of the big studios. If the price point were more reasonable (under $50) like the ""Charlie's Angels"" series set released 9/25/12, I wouldn't complain at all, but nearly $200 is way too steep.

To make matters even worse, the authoring problems that gave the Season 7 episodes an odd, jagged look (they were transferred at the wrong frame rate) have been corrected for this Complete Series, yet when consumers balked back in 2010 about the botched S7 set, they were told nothing could be done about it.

Thumbs down for this one. **UPDATE** A reviewer on another DVD Talk website took a few digs at those of us with this opinion calling us ""whiners"" but we don't receive review copies FREE like you do!",1347667200,45,1631,4.578767123287672

I would have Shout rather release the remaining 3 season that were left with extras which I would have bought.

5165722,5,B008HUSFTS,"Shout! Factory and Sony Studios must be applauded for bringing the entire library of episodes (213) of the most successful television series of the 1970's to DVD in one complete set: on October 30th, 2012 ""All in the Family"" will be made available in this superb deluxe edition on 28 discs along with many bonus features.

 ""All in the Family"" has gone down in TV history as being only one in a handful of network shows that was consistently #1 in the ratings for 5 consecutive years (1971-1976), had all its main lead actors win Emmy awards and is highly regarded for bringing television sitcoms out from the urban area of America to the issues facing people in the big cities, problems like unemployment, race relations, marital troubles, cancer and many more topical stories never found before on U.S. TV.

 The episodes look flawless, although the series was originally shot on videotape and not film and come unedited.

 The many bonus features announced is a beautiful 40-page book with essays by Pulitzer-Priza winning authors Tom Shales and Marty Kaplan who write about the longevity of ""All in the Family"", its impact on American culture and how the series changed television forever. There is a brand new interview with series creator Norman Lear, two documentaries called ""Those Were The Days: The Birth of ""All in the Family"" and ""The Television Revolution Begins: ""All in the Family"" Is On The Air"", the original ""All in the Family"" pilot ""Justice For All"" (shot for ABC in 1968, but that network passed on adding it to the schedule. It was considered lost or wiped for many years until a copy was found in 2009!) and the second ""All in the Family"" pilot ""Those Were The Days"" (shot in 1969, but again it was passed on by ABC) and finally the spin-off pilots of ""Gloria"", ""Archie Bunker's Place"" and ""704 Hauser"".

 I for one cannot wait to revisit Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria and their friends in what I consider one of my favorite shows ever that has never gone out of style.",1341964800,9,1993,4.706896551724138
8528258,5,B008HUSFTS,"If you want to save yourself possible disappointment buy this set directly and only from Amazon. I say this as there are a lot of boot sets floating around. They look just like a legit set but they are all on single layer discs and they quality is reduced, or worse.

I bought my set sold only by Amazon, not a third party or 'fulfilled by'. It cost me twenty bucks more but well WELL worth it. This 28 disc set is pressed on 25 dual layer DVD's and 3 single layer DVD's. The three single layer discs are on Season 1 which only has 13 episodes and has 4, 4 and 5 episodes respectively on the three Season1 discs. ALL the other discs (Seasons 2-9 and the bonus disc) are ALL on dual layer discs and measure 6-8 gb. in size. If you got a set with all single layer discs, you got a boot. Your non-Amazon sellers didn't deliberately do this, they got their sets from some middleman or other source, they didn't know!

The boot sets will have 8 episodes (season 2-9) on a 4gb single layer DVD-too much compression! The episodes will look like VHS tapes and maybe digital artifacts in the picture as well.

I suspect most all of the reviews here where people had missing discs, duplicate discs, misprinted discs, missing episodes, book poorly printed, etc. all got boot sets that were not purchased directly from Amazon.. I know my set which came from Amazon themselves is perfect, nothing missing, duplicated. misprinted, all 25 dual layer discs. Yes you might get the same as mine from a third party source but you might not. It's worth twenty extra bucks to me to save the possible hassle.

By the way, a set bought from Ebay is almost a 100 percent certainty to be a boot.

I've bought lots of other DVD's from third party sellers here and have never had an issue. Normally I look for a good deal but AITF seems to be a special case.

Realize that AITF was shot on videotape, not on film. Videotape is shot at a fixed resolution and that's it. You can't get any better resolution than the original equipment recorded. The first 5 seasons were shot on a video system called Quadraplex (or quad for short). It was the first video recording system invented and introduced in 1956. The maximum resolution it can do is about 400 horizontal lines at best-less than DVD! Perhaps equal or better than S-VHS. Therefore don't expect DVD quality especially from the earlier seasons. the later seasons were shot at a different location on batter equipment and are sharper.

My TV is a 27 inch old style CRT set. The episodes look quite good, better than the original 70's broadcasts I remember on my parents 19 inch Magnavox tube TV. An old CRT set can give a better quality picture from lower resolution sources (like VHS or videotape) than a modern flat panel set. A modern flat panel set only looks best at it's 'native resolution'-which means Hi-Def 1080p sources. Lower resolutions show flaws.

Also in the early 1970's, the biggest color TV was a 25 inch screen and most people had smaller sets. Even a 19 inch color TV was about $300-adjusted for inflation that's about $1800 in today's money.

So I am saying, get a legit DVD set, watch it on an appropriate sized screen and you will be satisfied. I'm giving the set 5 stars because it deserves it.",1529884800,,3242,4.48135593220339

What he did in the 1970's was make people think for themselves. We need that today, but sadly the pc police would never allow him to do today what he did back then. Today, as these works of art are replayed on some stations, none are allowed to broadcast without editing to water down the content, and dampen the punch they originally carried. And all that censorship is to our society's detriment. We need more Norman Lears in today's world who force us to confront our own bigotries and fears.
