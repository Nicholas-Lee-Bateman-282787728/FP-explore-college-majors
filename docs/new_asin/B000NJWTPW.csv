8178897,3,B000NJWTPW,"This film's title is a bit of a misnomer. It opens with Noelle's mother praying -crying out for God to help her daughter. Then over the next 80 minutes, we quickly learn that nearly everything wrong in Noelle's life has been caused by her mother or her father. In particular her mother's live in boyfriend James who has been sponging off her mother for the past five years and as Noelle finds out, sleeping with other women. Her mother refuses to believe this. That Noelle is pushed towards a boy who tells her she's pretty and speaks kindly to her is because she's getting little of this at home thanks to her absent father, her mother, and her mother's lazy no good boyfriend.

The film's story is interesting but sometimes I wonder whether the filmmakers actually understood their own story. As a Christian film, it was surprisingly silent on the moral implications of both her parents' extramaritial live-in relationships. It makes it hard for a teenager to practice sexual purity when her parents are hooking up with whoever.

Not only doesn't PastorJones comment on it, but when James finally does leave, Noelle's grandmother brings him back (because that's just what Noelle needed.) The film also features the star/producer/actor playing an unfunny second comic character as an out of touch grandfather.

However, the film is heartfelt with some nice musical notes. You do care about Noelle and her struggles. But at the end of the day rather than casting this as a film about a wayward teen, it'd be best to view this as a teen trying to survive a serve God despite immature parents, a messed up home life, and a well-meaning pastor who thinks the most important thing she can do is deliver the ""youth sermon.""",1413676800,2,1718,4.777777777777778

8178899,5,B000NJWTPW,"Many of my cohorts also love this movie.  When is Pastor Jones going to put out another movie like this one?  Pastors in general have so many stories of trouble and success.  Maybe he can do a movie on saints getting delivered.  There are real churches, e.g., Crusader's Ministries in Chicago doing deliverance and setting people free from addictions, lust, anger and etc.",1375660800,,372,4.857142857142857

8178901,5,B000NJWTPW,"I loved this movie, and all parents and their child/children should watch this movie. It will help parents and our youth understand each other better. Parents please do not shut your child down. Take the time to listen and not talk at them. (TALK TO THEM) Be there for them no matter what the situation or circumstances may be.

Youth remember this you have potential and hope when one say you don't. Just be strong and learn to say no, to things that will pull you down, you will be able to help another youth rise above their negative lifestyles.

If we just show a compassionate heart full of love and trust for one another this world would be a better place. That is exactly what this movie was emphasizing. Each One Reach One.....
