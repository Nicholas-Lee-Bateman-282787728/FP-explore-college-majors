471856,3,6302491975,"Where is the center to this film?  OK - we have a great start here from a GREAT Hammer Horror film. We have the legendary Hammer director Terrance Fisher.  We have the great Peter Cushing doing his great role as the evil  Dr.  We have an insane asylum.  We have the dead bodies, the gore, the  blood, the...what happened?
Yes, this film has its moments.  Yet, there  is very little real horror.  The ""Monster from  Hell"" is almost  lame.  In fact, in somem moments, he looks pretty awful.  Peter Cushing is  rarely allowed to do what he did so well in past films.  The supporting  cast is lackluster.  Yet, there are some good moments of Hammer charm.  I  think that the real problem was that the story just was not there.  The  story has Cushing and his assistant getting a genius at an insane asylum to  give over his brain(after a murder, of course!)to a giant hairy beast -  nothing really new.  This already mild story is done with no  imagination.
Yes, for Hammer fans, this one is entertaining - only if you  are already a disciple of Hammer.  Yet, if you're not, then stay away, this  is not where to start your Hammer quest.  Start with ""The Devil Rides  Out,"" ""The Horror of Dracula,"" or other greats.",939600000,3,1211,4.422018348623853

written and directed and the sets and costumes are great as all Hammer movies. My only thing is I thought the Monster from HELL's
makeup and costume was a bit over the top but not bad where it ruins the movie. For the last Hammer movie I think it's one of the best.

I thought this one was fine. I think that the evolutionary throwback thing (and make up with its immobile mask - yet so expressive eyes!) is a little overboard, but other than that it is a fine effort.
Love the trepaning scene and brain work, it retains all the squeamish qualities it ever intended. I sighed in relief when they cut away. I also love how Frankenstein narrates the process telling us exactly what is being done, even when we see none of it!!!

471912,5,6302491975,"For the Halloween season I've been revisiting all the Hammer Films I grew up watching on Double Chiller Theater on late night TV.

I've always loved what Hammer did to resurrect the classic monsters like the Mummy, Dracula and Frankenstein, giving them to us for the first time in color with more sex and violence.

The last Frankenstein picture they did was FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL.  Probably not one of the best, but it delivers everything you're used to from a Hammer Film: a gaunt Peter Cushing in an odd wig, blood, body parts, and a sexy Madeline Smith, although she's dressed in drab and baggy dresses for the most part (so the sexy part of Hammer was held back).

But the reason I'm giving this a full five-stars is for the commentary from Ms. Smith, David Prowse (completely unrecognizable as the Monster), and a Hammer historian.
Madeline and David's stories are not only about this film but also includes their other experiences with Hammer Films.  I found the commentary absolutely fascinating as they reminiscence about their careers (Madeline also talks about James Bond, The Vampire Lovers, and her stage work, while David talks about Kubrick's CLOCKWORK ORANGE and working with Peter Cushing again in the first STAR WARS).
I'm going to go find as many other Hammer films with commentaries and check them out!",1445731200,,1339,4.881057268722467

471962,3,6302491975,"Hammer Studios did 7 Frankenstein films from the late 50s to early 70s:

1. The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)
2. The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958)
3. The Evil of Frankenstein (1964)
4. Frankenstein Created Woman (1967)
5. Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969)
6. The Horror of Frankenstein (1970)
7. Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1973)

Peter Cushing played Baron Frankenstein in every one of these except ""The Horror of Frankenstein."" The reason being ""Horror"" was a remake of the original story and they needed a much younger actor to play the role; they chose Ralph Bates (who superbly played the love-to-hate OTT satanist in ""Taste the Blood of Dracula,"" released the same year).

Anyway, ""Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell"" was the last hurrah for the series. THE PLOT: A young doctor, Simon Helder (Shane Briant), is fascinated by Frankenstein's works and gets sentenced to an asylum for practicing sorcery. There he meets the thought-to-be-dead Baron Frankenstein, now going by the name Dr. Victor (Cushing), and they team-up to carry on his gruesome work, creating -- you guessed it -- a monster from hell!

This is an unmistakable Hammer film and solid Gothic chiller, but it's held back by a simplistic plot and dreary ambiance. The story lacks the fascinating and innovative approach of the two previous films, ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" and ""Frankenstein Must be Destroyed,"" which represent the best of the series. Furthermore, the setting of the story is too one-dimensional, basically being limited to the asylum, which adds to the dreariness. Speaking of which, the film lacks the bright colors usually associated with Hammer horror. The drab palate of the cinematography does up the ante of the Gothic atmosphere, but it'll likely disappoint those expecting the lushness of typical Hammer horror.

On the plus side, the creature looks seriously bestial and is formidable, played by David Prowse, aka Darth Vader of the first three Star Wars flicks. The monster also evokes a good amount of pathos. Another plus is the beautiful Madeline Smith of ""Live and Let Die"" fame, who plays the Baron's mute assistant, Sarah.

The story is basically a drama with horror trappings so those expecting the overt horror antics of most slasher films will be let down.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell"" is a solid Hammer horror film and a fine way to end their Frankenstein series, but it lacks the color and pizazz of the previous two installments. As such, it's overall mediocre.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot at EMI Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England.

471978,3,6302491975,"I absolutely love monster movies, in particular the older filmed renditions of classic tales. I read some of the reviews from viewers who are clearly Hammer fans and others without preference. Given that, I went into this film with an open mind and still feel a little on the fence about it.
Plot:  The film opens with a young Dr. Helder whos attempting to continue the work of Dr. Baron Frankenstein. He is caught by police and sentenced to 5 years in an insane asylum where he becomes the assistant to the disguised Dr. Frankenstein (now known as Dr. Victor the head doctor). Dr. Victor slowly kills off patients who posses certain attributes he deems needed and voile we meet our assembled monster.
The acting and dialogue is good, especially for an early 70s film with a genre such as this. The plot gives a little of an interesting twist to the typical clear cut classic storyline of Frankenstein, which most viewers might find refreshing. Just note that this film spends more time around plot and character development than around blood and gore. The lighting and cinematography I also found rather good (considering the era). There was also a part toward the end of the film where the set is a small scale model of the asylum and grounds; its absolutely adorable with appealing little details you simply must appreciate! Here is where I started to get a little confused and disappointed: when Frankensteins monster is finally revealed, (SPOILER ALERT), it looks like it morphed with the Wolf man/ a cave man. I think based on this, I would only recommend watching Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell if you don't romanticize the makings of a monster or if you enjoy movies with a steady and distinct style of character development.",1384819200,,1741,4.78405315614618

'FatMfH'  is  probably my least favorite of the Hammer Frankenstein series.  I believe it was also the last in the series.  I'm not saying it's a bad film.  In fact I did enjoy it.  I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of the other Hammer Frankenstein films featuring Mr. Cushing.  You really can't go wrong when you combine the acting of Peter Cushing with the direction of Terence Fisher.  I believe this was the last feature film that Mr. Fisher directed and the last time that Peter Cushing played the Baron in the series.  It had all the charm of a typical Hammer production with Mr. Fisher at the helm, wonderfully realistic characters, fine acting, and the sort of period colorful atmosphere Hammer excelled at.  The film did drag slightly at times, fortunately Peter Cushing and the other lead Shane Briant more than made up for that. My major complaint about the film is the poor makeup on the monster. It looked very phony to me, sort of a cross between a costume store gorilla suit that was losing it's hair and a neanderthal man. The monsters bare chest and back looked too much like a Halloween costume and not realistic. To me it was only a few steps up from the look of the comical gorilla like aliens in 'Robot Monster'.  In spite of that I still enjoyed the film.  It was a scary enough looking creation not to ruin the fun.  The story did manage to show just how cruel Mr. Cushing's Dr. Frankenstein really was beneath his gentleman like facade.  For instance he stated he did not want to murder an insane genius in order to use the poor man's brain for his creature.  Still he didn't mind setting up a situation where the disturbed man was bound to commit suicide. Frankenstein then took his brain with a clear, if sick, conscious.  Also, Frankenstein was willing to sexually sacrifice his gentle female assistant, Angel, to the monster for the sake of his experiment. It was both chilling and sad to see the disturbed genius who had killed himself wake up with his consciousness inside the body of a hideous monster.  The poor man was bemoaning his plight saying over and over 'why why why....'.  He had wanted to die and instead was doomed to this life instead, thanks to the cruelness of Frankenstein.  At one point he even dug up his old body and looked at it face-to-face.  This reminded me of a similar and memorable scene from an earlier Hammer Frankenstein film.

In conclusion this film is well worth seeing and was almost a fitting end to the Hammer Frankenstein series.  Fans of Peter Cushing and Terence Fisher should not be disappointed.  I give it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1384041600,2,2801,4.5029702970297025

471982,4,6302491975,"1973's FRANKENSTEIN & THE MONSTER FROM HELL is the final installment in Hammer's long running FRANKENSTEIN series which created a revolution in horror films back in 1957 by introducing color with THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Between these two titles were 5 other films ranging from first class (1967's FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN - the title being a parody of Brigitte Bardot's AND GOD CREATED WOMAN) to singularly unfortunate (1970's HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN - which was meant to be a parody). All but two were directed by Terence Fisher and only HORROR did not star Peter Cushing. For this last go round Cushing and company were working with severe budgetary limitations yet they managed to produce a fitting swan song.

Times had changed and horror movies were shot with bigger budgets and had become effects driven as opposed to story and character driven. Contemporary horror as epitomised by NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE EXORCIST was in and Gothic horrors were out even in England where the literary tradition began. Hammer could only afford less than $300,000 for FATMFH and while it shows in the miniature shots, the overall effect of the film is remarkably effective considering the budget. The sets are claustrophobic, the music intermittent, and the performances subdued giving the entire movie a melancholy air befitting its status as the last one in the series.

A cadaverous looking Peter Cushing is spot on as the elderly Baron. Although subdued in nature, he's still very much in control. Shane Briant is like a younger version of Cushing although he does show some conscience at the end. David Prowse uses his eyes effectively as the creature (weird make-up though) and Madeline Smith conveys innocence throughout which is very hard to do. Various small parts are played by well known British character players including Bernard Lee (M from the James Bond films). Although not in the best of health, Terence Fisher still directs with a firm hand using his camera fluidly and editing scenes for maximum impact. Speaking of editing, it should be noted that this American version of the film is 6 minutes shorter than the British one.

FATMFH was released by Paramount, 2 years after it was made, on a double bill with CAPTAIN KRONOS: VAMPIRE HUNTER. It did not fare well either here or abroad which hastened the original Hammer's demise. 40 years later it holds up quite well and is in the top third of Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN releases. I would love to see it partnered on Blu-Ray/DVD with SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA allowing us to see the swan song of both series together. It could then be bookended with the start-up films CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and HORROR OF DRACULA for a real comparison. Until then this Paramount DVD will have to do. The picture is sharp and clear and in the right aspect as well. Commentary by Dave Prowse and Maddie Smith about working for Hammer as well as on this film, gives the DVD an added dimension for hardcore fans.",1378944000,6,2958,4.8767395626242545

471985,3,6302491975,"Upon being imprisoned for bodysnatching and sorcery, a young surgeon learns that his esteemed mentor, the great Victor Frankenstein, is alive and well, and has been practicing his dark arts from within the prison walls as Dr. Carl Victor. Together, the pair manage to successfully transplant the brilliant mind of a scholar into the body of a murderous brute, but the body of the beast begins to take over its mind as it strikes off on a bloody rampage! Peter Cushing returns to the role of Baron Frankenstein in Hammer's sixth and final entry into the famed Horror series. Here, the character has taken a surprisingly modest turn that lacks the snide sense of superiority that defined Cushing's earlier performances. Cushing is in fine form, as always, and makes a grand entrance as he comes to the aid of young Simon. The plot, at this point, is quite derivative of the earlier films, but that makes it no less entertaining. Despite the shabbiness of the costume and an immovable facial apparatus, David Prowse manages to act through the make-up with his emotive gesturing and body language. FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL does bear the mark of Hammer's later films unfortunately, which attempted to exploit sex and gore in order to appeal to the changing tastes of the time. This film features the most graphic scenes in the series as a result, including a particularly nasty brain transplant and several bloody murders. As his last Horror film, however, Terence Fisher still retains many of the traditional Gothic trappings that gave him such success throughout the years. A lesser accomplishment in the series, to be sure, FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL is still a worthwhile entry for any fan of Gothic Horror.

472007,3,6302491975,"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell was the last of the Hammer Frankenstein series, as well as Terence Fisher's final film. It is generally regarded as a weak swansong.  At first glance, it seems a remake of The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), but with a noticeably reduced budget.

Peter Cushing, in his final portrayal of Baron Frankenstein, inexplicably sports a curly blond wig which makes him look a bit like a deranged Shirley Temple, and he looks alarmingly emaciated. Off-screen, the actor's wife had died, after a long illness, only the previous year, in 1971 (Monster from Hell was filmed in 1972 and remained on the shelf for two years).  Cushing was openly despondent and in intense mourning.  He later admitted to having had suicidal tendencies during this period.  Cushing never remarried, nor did he ever fully recover from the loss.  The toll of that recent personal tragedy is clearly visible on him in this film and, despite all of the atrocities committed by his character, that off-screen blow adds a layer of wearied pathos revealed in the actor's eyes.

Despite the many elements working against this film, its bad reputation is mostly hyperbole.  Like nearly all of Fisher's films, Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell is stamped with the director's assured composition and electric editing. The opening sequence, with a grave robber (Patrick Troughton, from Doctor Who and Scars of Dracula) being pursued by a constable,  is nearly as kinetically paced  as the tense opening of Frankenstein Must be Destroyed. Later in the film, the Baron, momentarily young again, springs to his old self  in a leap atop the creature's back.  The creature's eventual fate is gruesome and frenzied.  These are diversions from a prevailing, fatigued bleakness.  Indeed, a desolate milieu permeates this culmination of Fisher and Cushing's Baron Frankenstein saga.

David (Darth Vader) Prowse plays the monster, and he is as encased in his rubbery, hairy ape-like latex as he was in black armor.  Prowse attempts to inject sympathy into his monster, much the same way that Freddie Jone's monster did in the superb Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.  Prowse, however, was at the mercy of an immobile costume which defeats his efforts.

The Baron himself is a complicated mix of ruthlessness and an occasional ""weak"", but not wholly sincere, moment of pity.  While Frankenstein always had assistants since the introductory film, they normally aided him under coercion (Curse of Frankenstein, 1957), worshiped him without sharing his ruthless traits (Revenge of Frankenstein, 1958 & Frankenstein Created Woman, 1967 ) or did outright battle with him (the previously mentioned Curse & Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed).  This time, the Baron, working under another alias in an asylum, has a dedicated, recently convicted disciple in Dr. Simon Helder (dependable character actor Shane Briant), who is as amoral as his master and, at times, seems on the verge of surpassing the Baron in sheer lack of human empathy.

Both Frankenstein and Simon echo their inmate patients.  Their egos and delusions of godhood are clearly in intense competition.  A heavily symbolic scene  has the two scientists engaged in self-congratulatory songs of praise for having transplanted a musician's brain into the hulking monster.  All while the monster, upon awakening and seeing his new state, pathetically pleads ""why? why?""  The two doctors are totally oblivious.  Yet, Simon is not as completely barren as the Baron.  The apprentice comes to disagree with some of Frankenstein's methods, even if both of them succumb to an ""end justifies the means"" mentality.  In the right hands, the Simon character could have been an interesting and exploratory development.  Of course, it was not to be.

The poetry of math, the beauty of music and art are spirits which eludes Frankenstein. Yet, Frankenstein is relentlessly driven to succeed, consequences and casualties be damned.  The inevitability of his hollow, abject failure is forever denied and it is here that the Baron, despite being irredeemable, strangely evokes a degree of pity.

Anthony Hinds wrote the script (under his usual pseudonym, John Elder) to which Fisher responded with enthusiasm, knowing it to be his last film.  Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell parallels its main character.  It projects a tired spirit,one that is weighed down with a Bunyanesque burden, but moments of youthful charisma rise to the surface, in revolt against the final outcome of the process.

472008,5,6302491975,"This one was a little different from the prior Cushing Frankenstein entries in that the monster was a little updated and certainly a more sympathetic creature. But he could still tear up the dickens when he was displeased!

It takes place as a young Baron Frankenstein devotee, a competent and youthful-looking surgeon, is arrested by a buffoon of a constable for sorcery and is tossed into an insane asylum. And guess who's really running the nuthouse? Baron Frankenstein (Cushing)!

The Baron rescues the young doctor from a certain life of Hell and allows him to become the facility physician, giving the Baron more time to experiment with his creature. This Frankenstein monster, by the way, gets the brain of a musical and mathematical genius... but, Alas! It becomes flawed because the Neanderthal body in which the Baron has inserted it begins to dominate and degrade these fine grey cells.

One little comment about Peter Cushing, he was looking really old in this one (which he was!), and I think it substantially benefitted his fine performance in this excellent Hammer Film entry.

As usual, the sets are great and the cinematography is just tops. I really enjoyed this fine horror film.",1193011200,2,1198,4.975
472009,5,6302491975,"Terence Fisher's last film for Hammer (ever?) sees him re-united with the excellent Peter Cushing and doing what he does best; creating a dark, alien world with lush, watery colours, and using fluid camera tracking shots to tell a simple, gory, fairy-tale.

Fisher's influence is omnipresent in today's cinema - I saw 'Pan's Labyrinth' recently and had to smile at del Toro's gentle homage; his camera moving smoothly, yet malevolently through the forest trees,(on the edge of the soldiers camp) just as Fishers so often did.
And am I alone in thinking that the asylum set here at 'FATMFH' (though making 'Cell Block H's' look like 'Lord of the Rings' in terms of budget), bears more than a passing resemblance to the long-shot interiors of the good-ship Nostromo - such an important factor in the success of 'Alien'.

Fisher was a straight forward story-teller, the budget restrictions he  worked under saw to that.
No camera pyrotechnics or ambitious Russellian flourishes for him. No million dollar special effects, no prima-donna histrionics if he wasn't allowed more weeks to finish his latest masterpiece. A team player. A proper, old school pro.

Modern directors would pay a fortune for just a pinch of 'FATMFH's dank, enclosed atmosphere and many have tried to emulate it. Tim Burton being the most obvious, with varying degrees of success (Try shaving 90% off your budget Tim, that should do it).

Despite the fond memories and cosy reminiscences, this film is certainly not kid-friendly. There's an ugly incest sub-plot..hints at creationist engineering involving the divine Madeline Smith..and the eye-popping (fabulous, considering the budget) operation sequences, which had my long-suffering girlfriend reaching for her trusty 'green cushion' (the Ess households' equivalent of the Dr Who 'sofa') in abject  abhorrence.

There's a lot to amuse as well. Cushing looks as though he's having an absolute blast as the obsessed but clearly bonkers Baron F.
The 'God' character; mock-solemn, but really funny in a mad-haired, drunk itinerant kind of way.
A brilliantly low budget courtroom scene, where a pompous-rector judge's lines have obviously just been written ten minutes before, and the scene at the end; where one of the warders shouts ""There's a monster at large!"" at a mob of strung-out lunatics, makes me grin like a scalpel incision every time.

Technically its not bad either. Music, editing and the aforementioned sets are all good (just don't look TOO closely!). The only slight reservation I have is the 'monster' itself. Though facially hideous, its body looks like it's made of dusty buckram or something, draped in a muddy kaftan shawl (sorry, I've just  been watching Glastonbury),  but it's a tiny niggle.

In short, a rousing and grimly entertaining epitaph to some influential and majorly talented people.
The ultimate star rating then. Not just for the movie, which I like a lot; but for all that these people achieved, meant to me, and still do.
{I took Mr. Retrostars advice and tracked down the much-more-complete German R2 dvd,(hence the late review) as the razored 'DD' release is an insult;
It's miles better. Deeper colours and the German language soundtrack is easily turned to English. It's hard to review a film (or anything!!) when big chunks of it are missing; and no, those rotters at the BBFC bear no blame this time. Well worth the extra effort.}",1190851200,3,3394,5.108303249097473
472010,3,6302491975,"""Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell"" was Hammer's seventh and last film in their highly acclaimed Frankenstein series. While certainly not of a caliber as their earlier films, this movie is still quite enjoyable for a number of reasons, first and foremost being the return of Peter Cushing to the role after being replaced by the pallid and dull Ralph Bates for ""Horror of Frankenstein"". Cushing made this role his a long time ago, and he is always a joy to watch, glibly manipulating everyone around him, in this case the entire staff of an insane asylum, until everyone is working for him! Terence Fisher was back for one last go as director, and while this film falls a little short in some areas (notably the incredibly cheap-looking rubber suit of the neanderthal man-monster), Fisher's masterful handling of his actors never lets it get dull. It is a fitting conclusion to a wonderful series of films. One can only lament that Hammer's Dracula films never even approached this kind of continuity or satisfaction!",1141516800,2,1022,4.913294797687861
472011,4,6302491975,"The last of the Peter Cushing Frankenstein movies opens appropriately enough with a grave robbery.  The delivery of the corpse, however, is not going to Frankenstein but rather to Simon Helder, a doctor who wants to follow in Frankenstein's footsteps.  He is not very successful and in fact winds up arrested and sent to an asylum for the criminally insane.

Fortunately for Helder, Frankenstein is also in this asylum.  He was committed there years earlier, but with the asylum director's cooperation, has faked his death and now serves the institution as Dr. Viktor.  He is indeed the inmate running the asylum, and while not attending to patients, he is continuing his experiments.  Happily for Frankenstein, his position of authority finally frees him from the meddling officials who always seem to disturb his work.  Helder is soon working with him, along with the beautiful but mute Sarah.

This time, Frankenstein's subject is a ""neolithic"" man who is monstrous in size but homicidal.  When the ""monster"" almost dies in an escape attempt, Frankenstein takes it upon himself to fix him up, giving him new hands, eyes and a brain.  Of course, things go awry and the monster goes on a rampage.  (As a note of trivia:  this movie has David Prowse as the monster; he would go on to work with Cushing in Star Wars.)

The Hammer Frankenstein movies are a fun set, particularly due to Cushing.  Unlike the Universal Frankenstein series, the focus is on the scientist, not the monster.  Colin Clive, who is probably the most well-known Frankenstein from the Karloff movie (and despite the quality of the Hammer movies, none can top Universal's Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein), played the scientist as an obsessed genius.  Cushing is driven less by obsession and more by arrogance, which often drives him into a villainy that Clive's Frankenstein would never have dared.

Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell is not a perfect movie, but it does not have some nice moments.  Overall, it rates a low four stars, not bad, but not spectacular either.",1138665600,3,2053,4.953216374269005
472012,5,6302491975,"Actually, I find this film to be better than ""Curse of Frankenstein"".  I realize that ""Curse"" being the first would necessarily be rougher around the edges.  Cushing has yet to find that sweet spot in his portrayal of Dr. F, and that first film, despite having color and more gore, is still not as ghoulish as Wale's original while remaining a rehash.  Don't get me wrong, I still like it, but ""Monster from Hell"" has a very subtle air of camp to it (""Kidneys!  Mmmmm, Dee-licious!"") that doesn't interfere with Hammer's usual luridly straight-faced presentation of their Frankenstein films.  True, nothing original, but what actually is anyway?  Great performances from the entire cast, as well as a little more story than Hammer's usual stretched-out-short-story manner of script.  Intelligent in a way that ""Scars of Dracula"" never could be and although perhaps the following has been done to death here, I must say it:  PETER CUSHING!!!!  Interestingly, despite the slamming it generally gets, this film has the second highest number of reviews for a Hammer Frankenstein film after ""Curse"", and the final average is quite high.  Maybe not the best Hammer Frankenstein, but a worthy final act nevertheless.",1135036800,,1209,5.091370558375634
472013,5,6302491975,"The fifth and not surprisingly the last in Terence Fisher's Frankestein series as far as becomes a successful tour de force where Fisher carries to its extremes the dialectic ( already begun in the first part of the series ) between ethics and science and again gets to give another turn of screw to the character of the baron driving him to dementia ( the studio of the baron is surrounded of delirious surrealist illustrations of anatomycal figures playing artistic performances ) in his anxiety of recognition for his medical researches. Fisher has described the character incarnated convincingly in all the series by Peter Cushing as a man condemned to failure due to Frankenstein has sold his soul to science, in the reactionary setting, moreover, of the superstitious and conservative Victorian society whose double morality the british director satiryzes through its ""hygienic"" institutions. Dr. Simon Elder ( Shane Briant )has been confined to an asylum during 5 years under observation for the same court that condemned some years agohis admirated mentor( and never met before ) baron Victor Frankenstein, accussed as him for practising sorcery. Soon discovers that the baron works as the staff doctor of the asylum under the identity of Doctor Carl Victor after planning his own death with the complicity of the director, a weak and depraved man who has given free hand to the baron to continue his experiments about life after death between the walls of the mental institution in correspondence to Frankenstein's silence about his sexual deviations and underground ""affaires"" in the management of his public charge.

The plot reminds the main idea that rules Edgar A. Poe  grotesque short-story  "" The system of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether "", which is settled too almost enterely in an asylum . Fisher show us a world turned down, a quixotesc story  where insane people rules a mental institution and sane people are treated as madmen: Frankenstein is a monomaniac( the ambiguous morality of the character has completely dissapeared here )obssessed in turning to live a gloomy humanoid created with the body parts of deceased inmates ( the ones the baron calls his  ""favourites""); the director is a sexual deranged who has raped his own daughter and likes to abuse of his female patients. In the other side, a gentle and brilliant mathematician who was interned for a simple nervous problem is imprisoned in a cell for dangerous patients and a young surgeon with medical progresist ideas is under treatment accused to be a sorcer.

The oppressive atmosphere ( as I have told upper the action takes place almost completely between the walls of the asylum ), the metallics colours and the expresionist use if light ( a chilly blue light involves the figure of the baron while is absorbed in his clandestine cold-blooded experiments)contributes to the sensation of hallucination that surrounds all the film conducting it efficiency to the nightmarish climatic ending . The result is an original film plenty of macabre poetry . Fisher reinvents with wisdom through the tradition joining the bizarre gothic imaginary of an Edgar A. Poe with the sarcastic visual imagination of G.K. Chesterton without damage of the director's personality.

 Fisher observes the baron with sharp ironic distance, converting so the studious in object of study, but he analyses his ""creature "" in  the exactly opposed position the insensible baron observes his ""human"" experiments: to show us the contradictions of science in his ambition of serve mankind and the risky vanity of the scientist. This ironic twist is beautifuly illustrated in the scene we see the  baron observing without hidden joy the eye-ball of one of his victims with a high lens. Fisher inmediately puts the camera in the reverse angle showing us now the observative eye of the baron through the mentioned glass.",1114646400,2,3868,5.086750788643533
472043,4,6302491975,"If I had seen this movie as a child, it would have scared the living daylights out of me. Seeing it as an adult, it still gave me bad dreams. I really didn't expect such a classic Hammer production from one of their later films. It suggests the style from about ten years earlier in the full bloom of Hammer Horror.  True, the monster is definitely on the low-budget side, but when he shambles toward you JUST before the door gets shut there is a deep primordial shudder evoked.

The story revolves around the most appropriate question of ""what would Frankenstein do if he lived in an lunatic asylum?"" The answer, not surprisingly, is to find new ground to plow in the old cemetary. Rejecting Universal's formula of creating new mayhem for the old monster to stumble through, Hammer's Frankenstein creates new ""monsters"" with their own, original baggage and issues. Also, they continue to twist the theme of ""who is the real monster?"" with new horrors consistently pointing to the diabolical Baron himself. In this area, Peter Cushing is fabulous. One wonders if the studio would have existed at all without him and Christopher Lee.

Another theme is presented again: degrees of evil. Frankenstein is a maniacal sociopath surrounding himself and exploiting those who have sinned in some awful manner. This is the truly horrifying nature of Monster from Hell. The asylum could be a metaphor for Hell and the inmates, damned souls. The ending fulfills this allegory: no one is leaving, and the torture begins anew.",1103241600,3,1512,4.875486381322958
472044,5,6302491975,"The first film I ever saw in Hammer Studio's Frankenstein series was also the very last, which I feel is a terrible shame, as this was a very good movie.  While Hammer's Dracula films drastically revamped themselves twice over the course of their last three films, the Frankenstein series, which was running simultaneously, did it once and even then only partially (by doing no more than cast a younger actor as Dr. Frankenstein).  So we have Peter Cushing returning for one final time, after a one-film break with the new guy, in the role of the good doctor, where we get to see him act with Darth Vader three years before the making of ""Star Wars"" (David Prowse, the man in the Darth Vader suit, is the monster in this one).  And I'm glad that Cushing came back, because his performance is what makes this movie so great.

Rather than discuss plot points, as I'm sure you by now have a fairly vague idea of what to expect from this series (though I would like to mention that we get to see the second Doctor Who, Patrick Troughton, as a grave robber at the beginning of the movie), I would instead like to discuss Dr. F, because the character absolutely fascinates me ... especially in this particular film.  Here we have a true monster, far worse than any undead beast he could ever bring back to life.  Dr. F cares for absolutely nothing but his work ... not only does he have no second thoughts when it comes to disturbing graves, but he goes so far as to see the living as nothing more than potential materiel for his experiments.  Witness the casual way he speaks of the patient he prompted to commit suicide (without ever explicitly stating his intention, but by leaving for the patient to read such depressing news that he knew exactly how the patient would react).  When I first saw this scene, together with the final one, when Dr. F speaks optimistically about ""the next time"", I shared completely the shock, dismay, and revulsion felt by our young protagonist, Dr. Helder (Shane Bryant), as he realizes that the man whose work he'd dedicated his studies to and who(m) he'd idolized is so completely inhuman beneath his appearance and kindly manner, so totally obsessed with his life's work that nothing else matters at all, not even his own creations.

Dr. Frankenstein is amoral ... he does whatever he feels is necessary for  his experiment to succeed, and hasn't a single care when those actions bring harm or death, let alone anxiety, to anyone else.  And yet while certainly not a ""good"" man, the wicked acts which Dr. F commits are not motivated by malice or a desire to harm ... He's simply so completely blinded by the world of science that it's impossible for him to think in any other way.  This makes him, for me at least, one of the most frightening characters in the whole realm of Horror ... a totally conciousless scientist, fanatically devoted to his work and more brilliant than we can even try to imagine.  From the films I've seen, I don't believe that any of them give a better, more thought-provoking portrait of the character than this one, without having to rely on any of the films which came before.

""Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell"", in spite of suffering from such an awful title, is a wonderfully intelligent and intriguing, visually striking (I love the dreary hallways of the mental institution, as well as the shots of the creature in the graveyard at night), and very well acted indeed.  Peter Cushing is one of my favorite actors, and here he certainly doesn't disappoint.  Do yourself a small act of kindness and pick up a copy of this DVD today, and then watch it tonight after the lights are out.  I think you'll have a marvelous, though somewhat unsettling, time ...

This film will entertain you, but it will also make you think.  Definitely five-star material.

472046,3,6302491975,"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell is an aptly titled film.  It is truly full of mood and drama, but it lacks a real sense of forboding and eeriness that previous turns provided.  Further, Cushing, while always excellent, is just not his usual self.  The DVD extras tell us he was still reeling from the death of his wife.
Though Fisher really approaches the subject matter rather scholastically rather than as one might hope, from a sense of foreboding, it isn't really the film as a whole that I have a problem with.  It's the creature.
David Prowse (of Darth Vadar fame) plays the creature as best as can be expected given the costuming provided.  The costume consists of a wetsuit all but completely covered in hair.  Only the pectorals don't have long coarse hair on them.  And the pectorals look extremely fake - papier macher fake.  The monster looks less like a creature cobbled together from body parts than a gorilla suit or something left over from Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Although it is explained that the body and head are from a man who was something of a ""neolithic"" nature, it makes little sense to choose him since Frankenstein never wanted a brutish creature before and even here he wants a refined brain and hands for his creature - so why have, what especially in the period's times, what would have been considered crude and low class bodily - a hairy brute with thick lips and heavy eyes?
I know the reasoning was for horror's sake, but I find a gorilla-like man far less horrific than a man stitched together looking gentile and refined underneath his stitches.
The acting is superb, as usual and the sets are really top notch.  The script is a bit thin, and the monster costume is really laughable, but it is a worthwhile film.
The DVD extras are another matter.  I enjoyed them all but for the narrative.  And those I might have enjoyed, but for the kind lady who had the female ""engenue"" role in the film.  A mute in the film, in the DVD extras she just couldn't keep her mouth shut.  She prattled on and on and on about any and every thing.  She and David Prowse are the narrators of the audio and though they really don't have large enough roles to warrant this (it seems that Shane Briant should have been narrating it), they seem to want to talk incessantly about things that have nothing to do with the film at hand and the things they do discuss are not relavant to what is happening on screen.  So many opportunities for interesting information transfer are lost as they pass them by.  For instance, toward the beginning of the film, Shane Briant's character actually appears to be taking the full force of a real fire hose.  His skin actually raises up red welts to the force of the hose as we watch the film, yet it is never divulged to us whether this was really the case.  Rather the young lady goes on and on about how she really thinks the dress she was wearing was terribly dowdy.  Well, you get the gist of it.
Watch the film - enjoy it - skip the audio commentary on the DVD extras.",1086566400,4,3032,4.458333333333333
472047,4,6302491975,"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974) marks the final installment of the Hammer Studios Frankenstein films and also the last film by perennial Hammer director Terrance Fisher.
The film stars Peter Cushing as Baron Von Frankenstein, aka Dr. Carl Victor.  Confined to an asylum for the charge of sorcery due to his last foray into the creation of man, Frankenstein, along with the director of the asylum, orchestrated the death of Dr. Frankenstein and his new identity to allow for the Baron to assume the duties of staff doctor within the asylum.  Frankenstein, now Dr. Victor, has a fairly free hand to do as he pleases due an intimate knowledge of some of the asylum director's peccadilloes and past indiscretions, and has once again begun his quest to create life where there was none before, from body parts culled from recently deceased inmates.
Dr. Simon Helder (Shane Briant) has just recently been committed to the asylum for trying to follow in Frankenstein's footsteps, and learns that Frankenstein is alive and well, working under his current pseudonym.  I remember Briant from other Hammer films like Demons of the Mind (1972) and Kronos (1973).  Dr. Carl allows for the younger doctor to assume his routine duties within the asylum, caring for patients, freeing up the elder to pursue his experimentations.  The good doctor seems to have created quite the hairy behemoth, using various bits and pieces of some of the recently deceased, more interesting inmates.  The monster, played by David Prowse (Darth Vader in the early Star Wars films), has the best features of these poor, departed souls, but lacks an adequate brain.  Did I mention he is also very hairy?  I probably did, but it's worth mentioning again as the dude is almost ape-like.  But what's this?  We are soon introduced to an inmate whose intellect far surpasses even his keepers?  I am sure that will come into play later...
Also starring is the comely Madeline Smith as Sarah, a mute resident, also known to the inmates as Angel.  She acquired the moniker while being in the service of Dr. Karl as his assistant, and having the ability to deal with the crazy people with a quiet, gentle bedside manor.
With the aid of his young assistants, Sarah and Dr. Helder, Dr. Karl completes the hideous creature, and all seems a success.  But is it?  What happens when you play mix and match with body parts from various individuals, not to mention various mentally disturbed individuals?  The success is soon overshadowed by problems as the creature begins to understand his own being, from whence he came.
I thought this was a great 'last hurrah' for Hammer and Fisher, despite some of the concessions made due to a smaller budget, i.e. the obvious use of miniatures when showing exteriors of the asylum and the stiff and unresponsive suit worn by Prowse.  Most of the film takes place in the confined quarters of the asylum, giving the viewer a sense of being trapped in a nightmarish world within.  I really enjoyed the camaraderie between Dr. Helder and Dr. Karl, and I can't help but wonder if the characterization was carried over into real life between the Briant and Cushing.  There were also a few neat surprises that help to flesh out the story, adding depth to the characters, allowing for a real interest to develop for the viewer.  The gore is present, but another reviewer has stated that some of the more gory aspects have not been included in the film.  I couldn't help laughing at the scene when Dr. Karl and Dr. Helder are removing the 'old' brain from the creature and Dr. Karl unceremoniously drops it into a dish on the floor (just throw that anywhere) and then proceeds to trip on the dish, spilling the contents over the floor, his reaction being that of someone who just knocked over a bowl of milk for kitty.  A nice, little touch.
The print here looks really good and sharp, and special features include a commentary by actress Madeline Smith, actor David Prowse, and horror historian Jonathan Sothcott, one which I haven't had an opportunity to listen to, but sounds to be interesting.

He ends up in the same hospital as Frankenstein did several years earlier, and he meets Dr. Carl Victor a.k.a. Baron Victor Frankenstein.  Together they continue Baron Frankenstein's inquiries into the human body and life after death, but it takes a new bizarre turn.  Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell is an interesting story in the sense that it uses science in a peculiar, yet realistic, manner for its time.

472049,5,6302491975,"Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell was not famed Hammer Studios' final film, but it in many ways represents the swan song of the premiere maker of vintage gothic films.  Not only does the film play well even today, it has an incredible number of fascinating facts surrounding its production that makes it particularly notable.  Consummate actor Peter Cushing and director Terence Fisher can be viewed as founding fathers of Hammer Studios, and this film marks a return to the spirit of the early days.  It stands as the final entry in the famed Frankenstein series starring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein, and David Prowse makes an unprecedented second appearance as a Hammer monster.  Some wonderful actors appear in even the smallest of roles, the overall look and feel of the film is wonderfully dark and serious, and the story is allowed to tell itself, foregoing sex appeal for violence and intellectual passion.  Despite its almost ridiculously paltry budget, Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell truly shines as Hammer's last truly gothic motion picture.
Baron Frankenstein is dead; there's a death certificate to prove it, and he's buried in the yard of the insane asylum where he spent his last days.  One young researcher sets out to fill his shoes, however, eventually being arrested for ""sorcery"" and consigned to the same mental institution as his idol.  Simon Helder (Shane Briant) inquires about Dr. Frankenstein as soon as he arrives.  The story of the Baron's death notwithstanding, he quickly recognizes the asylum's Dr. Victor as none other than Frankenstein himself.  Assisted by the mute and ever so lovely Sarah (Madeline Smith), known as Angel among the inmates, the doctor has continued his work.  He explains to young Dr. Helder how he managed to ""kill"" Frankenstein and get himself appointed the medical doctor in the asylum, and soon the ever-curious Helder is an active participant in the doctor's ongoing unconventional medical experiments.  Rather than resurrect the dead, Frankenstein is now working on making a new man piece by piece based on an existing flawed creation.  With the help of Helder's surgical skills, the men have soon given an animalistic misanthrope the hands of a craftsman and the mind of a genius, but of course the newly created monster seems less than overjoyed with his new life.
I am an unabashed fan of Peter Cushing; he was the ultimate gothic actor, a meticulous perfectionist who demanded the serious commitment of everyone surrounding him on whatever project he was working on.  In Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell, he makes one of his most memorable entrances and delivers a sterling performance.  At this particular time, Cushing was in deep mourning over the recent loss of his wife, and he is as grim and emaciated as you will ever see him.  This makes his obviously whole-hearted commitment to this role all the more amazing.  This sixth and final Hammer-produced Frankenstein film offers yet more proof that Peter Cushing is the greatest horror actor to ever live.  Madeline Smith is just beautiful and delivers an amazing performance almost wholly devoid of spoken lines, and Shane Briant, looking quite James Spader-like, makes young Helder an admirable and deserving new underling of Dr. Frankenstein's.  The monster is played wonderfully by David Prowse, the man who would later serve as the man behind the mask of Darth Vader; his costume isn't that impressive, but it works well given the budgetary constraints this movie operated under.  Doctor Who fans will no doubt note the presence of Patrick Troughton as Helder's bodysnatching accomplice at the beginning of the film; Troughton would of course go on to become the second man to play Doctor Who on the famed BBC television series.
Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell is vintage Hammer horror, a really quite extraordinary achievement given the monetary and personal constraints the production faced.  Terrence Fisher and Peter Cushing make an unbeatable combination, even when both men are laboring under heavy burdens of their own.  The DVD comes with a commentary by actress Madeline Smith, actor David Prowse, and horror historian Jonathan Sothcott, and this commentary ranks among the best and most interesting I have ever heard.  The trio expound upon all types of things, oftentimes going beyond the subject of the film itself to relate fascinating stories about their fellow performers and about the very history of Hammer Studios as well.  All of this adds up to a film that all Hammer fans simply must own.",1072483200,10,4562,5.085790884718499

I guess also for fans of David Prowse (body of Darth Vader) who plays ""the monster from hell""!  This is Hammer director Terrence Fisher's last film, another reason why it's worth a look.  Fisher is responsible for much of Hammer's horror classics: all 5 Frankenstein films, Horror of Dracula, The Mummy, Curse of the Werewolf, The Gorgon, Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll, Phantom of the Opera, the list goes on...
This is also the last film in Hammer's Frankenstein series.  It all started in 1957 with The Curse of Frankenstein, an absolute classic starring Cushing as Victor Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as the Creature.  This is followed by Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), Frankenstein created Woman (1967), and Frankenstein must be Destroyed (1969), which brings us to The Monster from Hell (1974).
The plot concerns Victor Frankenstein (Cushing) being the resident medical doctor at an insane asylum where he secretly experiments with creating his own being. He's also a patient, by the way!  He soon meets a young patient/doctor, Simon Helder (Shane Briant), who is sent to the asylum because he is caught doing similar experiments in the outside world.  Frankenstein takes Helder under his wing and uses him to perform surgeries that he can no longer do because of his burnt hands.  Frankenstein lets Helder in on what he's doing and introduces him to ""the monster from hell"" played and grunted by David Prowse of Darth Vader fame.  Long story short, Frankenstein's creation grows tired of his lifestyle...and watch out!
This film is nowhere near as bad/silly as others may write.  Yes there are bits of cheese, a laugh or two, and some underacted scenes, but don't most horror films have that?  Its not a scarefest, but its not a laughfest either.  Besides,its Cushing, Fisher, and Hammer for cryin' out loud!  Paramount's DVD has a good looking 16:9 widescreen transfer, decent dolby digital mono sound, and english subtitles.  Making it special is a commentary by David Prowse, Madeline Smith (Sarah/""Angel"", Frankenstein's initially mute assistant) and historian Johnathan Sothcott.  It also can be purchased for the same price as renting it a few times! All in all, it isn't the best Hammer film to start with, but it has its good qualities, most importantly atmospheric direction from Fisher and a solid creepy performance by Cushing, may they both rest in peace.  Thanks to both of them for giving us so many classics.",1068336000,9,2678,4.968609865470852
472071,5,6302491975,"Peter Cushing's (the Baron) first scene entrance at the asylum is the most stunning and regal I have seen in the Hammer Frankenstein series. His clothing and choice of fabric colors are a perfect match with his facial structure, top hat and hair piece (which he designed himself).  Peter Cushing had Presence to burn without a doubt!  Peter's attention to subtle detail in his roles really makes a difference (something LACKING in today's films among a host of other things). Peter performs a great stunt for the viewer without the aid of a double in this gothic feature. He is quite athletic in this film, he was around 60 at this time I believe; very impressive. By this period in Peter's career his screen time was less , with some exceptions, ""Twins Of Evil"", ""The Creeping flesh"" and ""Satanic Rites of Dracula"" so it is wonderful to get such a healthy dose in this film.  Films like ""And now the Screaming Starts"", ""Fear in the Night"" ""Shatter"" and ""Vampire Lovers"", and the Amicus Horror anthologies had Peter on the screen for shorter periods, just bit parts really.  His wife's illness and untimley death had alot to do with this and is quite understandable.
The script is well exectuted and the supporting actors do a fine job. The film has a good pace and is interesting and creepy (a little dry ice (fog) would have been great for the day for night scene).  Shane Bryant looks great as usual and is in fine form (only Robert Plant in the early 1970's had a better head of hair). This was graceful exit for Terence Fisher, the Baron and the Hammer Gothic's. The film is serious and little sad, but the ending has the Baron ready to move on to his next project, albeit with a degree of forced optimisum on his part, although the film does show an element of the the Baron loosing touch a bit as well.  All of this is done without any nudity, profanity, or extreme gore (some scenes have been deleted but it does not disturb the film).  The DVD picture quality is great.  The sound is very good.  Anchor Bay still is the reigning King of Hammer releases but Paramounts release is an improvment of the first batch of Warner DVD's ""The Mummy"" ""Dracula"" etc. Thank you Hammer Family, Peter & Terence for a great conclusion of the Frankenstein series!
****P.S. Hammer, Tigon, Amicus and Tyburn film lovers Please let Anchor Bay Entertainment know they need to release all British Fantasy, Gothic, Sci-fi's including ""Twins of Evil"", ""Evil of Frankenstein"", ""The Gorgon"", ""Capt Klegg"" ""She"" and ""Vampire Circus"".

472072,3,6302491975,"During the late 1950s, all of the 1960s, and the early part of the 1970s, Hammer Studios, a British film production company, made several successful horror movies featuring the famous and popular monsters from successful American films of the 1930s and 1940s.  Characterized by gothic sets, exaggerated color, lots of blood, and lots of female cleavage, the MOST successful of these included a film series featuring Dracula and a series based on the Frankenstein mythos.
Though generally low-budget productions, most of the Hammer films in the Frankenstein series were well made and were favorably received by horror fans in both Britain and the United States.  The last in this series, FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL, is certainly not the best of the lot, but it is an entertaining movie that has many notable qualities.
The script can admittedly be a bit tasteless at times, but it is nonetheless quite literate.  It regards the good Doctor (Peter Cushing) not as a comical mad scientist, but instead as an intelligent, educated man who is so driven in his quest for medical knowledge that he has no regard for the feelings or needs of others.  Selfish and egoistic, to be sure, but not insane.  This point is emphasized by the story setting--an insane asylum of the Victorian era.  Though Doctor Frankenstein was committed to the hospital as a resident by the English courts, he has since wrested control away from the inept administrator and hence runs the place by proxy.  Of course, with such a stable of raw material at his disposal, the good Doctor has resumed his research into the reassembling and re-animation of the dead.
As in the other such Hammer films, Peter Cushing does a very effective job as the driven and heartless Doctor Frankenstein.  Along with fellow thespian Christopher Lee--who generally played the titular character in Hammer's Dracula movies--Cushing was at the forefront of the Hammer stable of actors, but American moviegoers will more readily recognize him from his role as Grand Moff Tarkin in 1977's sci-fi blockbuster STAR WARS.  (The actor who played the monster in this film, David Prowse, also had a part in STAR WARS.  Prowse was behind the mask of Darth Vader, though it was an American actor, James Earl Jones, who gave voice to the evil ex-Jedi.)
Shane Briant is also quite good as the Doctor's medical prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and fans of British science fiction will be delighted by the cameo appearance of Patrick Troughton, who portrayed the second incarnation of titular character on the long-running TV series DOCTOR WHO.  (Interestingly, Peter Cushing also once portrayed The Doctor in two theatrical movies based on the TV show.)
Beautiful and buxom dark-haired actress Madeline Smith turns in a very affecting performance as a mute asylum resident who also assists Doctor Frankenstein in his ghastly experiments.  Ardent fans of James Bond movies will recognize her from her role as Miss Caruso in the 1973's LIVE AND LET DIE.  Bond fans should also recognize Bernard Lee, who had a recurring role in the venerable spy movies as M, James Bond's enigmatic boss.  In FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL, Lee has a minor part as one of the asylum residents.
Under normal circumstances, this film would receive a four-star rating.  However, some of the gorier scenes that were cut for the original American theatrical release are also missing from the DVD release--a real no-no for serious film collectors.  For example, there is a scene where Frankenstein, his hands damaged by a lab accident (depicted in an earlier Hammer film), literally bites down on a vein or artery to halt blood flow while his prot&eacute;g&eacute; sutures another part of the monster's body.  With the scene cut, the two medical men discuss a problem with the suturing procedure, they move to begin the stitching, then it cuts to Frankenstein wiping his mouth with a handkerchief as he sardonically states to his assistant something like, ""You see, I told you there is always a way around any problem.""  This creates a bit of confusion for the viewer, and for this cumbrous ""amputation"" of such scenes, the DVD receives only three stars.
Overall, FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL will prove to be a fun and satisfying flick for longtime horror fans, but the general moviegoing audience my find it somewhat unpalatable.",1067472000,8,4358,5.020804438280167
472073,5,6302491975,"Peter Cushing, in my opinion the Greatest actor in the world! This was Cushing's last movie as Baron Frankenstein. A person always wanting to do what he thinks is right. I love this film, they don't make movies like this anymore, also look for Shane Briant as the Baron's pupil. A great last finish for Baron Frankenstein, and this was also Terence Fisher's last movie. This movie was made in 1972 as some people putting it as being made in 1974. David Prowse is a great creature.",1065139200,,480,4.528735632183908
472074,4,6302491975,"Dr. Simon Helder (Shane Briant) is a would-be Frankenstein. After being caught with a room of human parts, which he purchases, he is arrested, put on trial and convicted of witch-craft. He is committed to an asylum for the insane and finds that Frankenstein himself (Peter Cushing) runs the hospital. Of course Frankenstein has continued his experiment and with the aid of a young mute girl and Simon, manages to put-together an ape like man from various inmates from the asylum. He has the brain of a genius, body of a killer, hands of a craftsman, and no soul.
The movie has good effects, such as moving eyes in a jar. There is plenty of shock for 1973 and Peter Cushing gives another fine performance.
This was Terence Fishers last film.",1061683200,,740,4.656488549618321
472075,4,6302491975,"""Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell"" is not only the last film in Hammer's Frankenstein series, it was director Terence Fisher's last work as well.  Here we have Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing, back where he belongs after the debacle of ""Horror of Frankenstein"") playing the role of mentor.  Young Simon Helder (Shane Briant) has been trying to follow in the legendary footsteps of Dr. Frankenstein but is convicted of sorcery by the authorities and imprisoned in Carlsbd Asylum.  However, Simon is saved from being brutalized by the inmate's physician, ""Dr. Victor,"" who soon has the young man helping him with his nefarious experiments.  Since his hands were damaged in ""Evil of Frankenstein,"" Victor has a mute girl named Angel (Madeline Smith) sew together his new creature (David Prowse again).  Simon helps procure various organs until only the brain remains and Victor wants to use that of Professor Durendal (Charles Lloyd Pack), a musicial and mathematical genius prone to fits of violence.  Frankenstein drives Durendal to suicide and performs the brain transplant.  Now in the brutish body of the ""monster,"" Durendal finds he can no longer play his beloved violin.  Then the homicidal tendencies of the body began to take over, Simon has grave doubts about the entire experiment, and the Baron comes up with his most revolting plan ever as we head towards the final climax.
Ultimately this is a slightly above average Hammer Frankenstein movie.  Certainly the Baron is tipping back towards the amoral/sadistic side of his character, but the monster is almost as sympathetic a figure as it was in ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.""  However, the blood and gore quotient is as high as you will find in any Hammer film.  The biggest problem with ""Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell"" is that Victor's motivations are totally stripped away: Dr. Frankenstein makes monsters, so that is what he does in this movie.  No longer a figure of ambiguity, Victor is now just like a force of nature, playing God and leaving the rest of the cast in his wake.",989884800,4,2070,5.02046783625731
472076,4,6302491975,"This was Hammer's final entry in the ""Frankenstein"" series and it indeed went out with a bang...I saw this as a kid on a late night ""Thriller Chiller Theatre"" type program, and it was heavily edited...but what fun! Peter Cushing once again completley steals the show as Dr. Frankenstein (or Dr. Victor) and just chews up the scenery. David ""Darth"" Prowse was the monster this time in a strange neandrethal-like suit, and manages to evoke sympathy for the monster like Karloff did in the 30's. Very Gothic/Victorian and great atmosphere, especially the scene where the Monster rips up the graveyard. The film takes place in an insane asylum, and deals with Dr. Frankenstein's being in charge there, and he continues his ghoulish expiriments with the help of a new assistant. Wonderful entry in the Hammer series and just cheesy enough.",983664000,3,834,4.964285714285714
472077,3,6302491975,"By the time I finally saw this one, I  had heard a lot about it and yes  most of it was bad. However, this film was overall better than I thought it  would be, but not as good as it could have been. The film starts out pretty  good and brings Frankenstein into the fold fairly well. The asylum was a  good choice for a setting because it is a change from the isolated castles  and dark basements. The story is nothing new, but there are enough moments  to keep it interesting. The monsters trip through the graveyard really  stands out as one of the better scenes. The ending was not the best, but  compared to FCW and HOF it is certainly not the worst. Peter Cushing gives  a good performance, he does tend to help keep this film together at times  when it could have just fallen flat. He uses his bitter sarcasm and  overbearing auhtority to keep things interesting. After seeing his  ""acting"" in Demons of the mind and Captain Kronos, I fully  expected Shane Bryant to put forth another bland,lame performance. He  really does okay, not great, but good enough. Sometimes I did wish that  Peter Cushing had more support in this one because there are times where  you just wish they had a Michael Ripper or a Thorley Walters to help a  little. The two biggest problems with this film are the monster and the  ending. It is a shame when David Prowse looked better in HOF which was  played for laughs than he does in this which is serious. The hairy suit and  the big facial features just don't even come close to cutting it. They just  should have used some simple surgery scars like in FMBD to make the monster  look convincing. My other problem is the ending, it really seems like they  put no thought into it. This film is pretty good, Hammer's Frankenstein  series ended on a higher note than their Dracula series did.",959817600,2,1822,4.4156626506024095

In any event, maybe it's good the series ended with this--better to go out on a high note than fizzle out. This time--like many times before--the Baron is presumed dead and living under an alias; running a mental institution. Another assistant, another pretty starlet, and another monster make for a pretty good end to maybe Hammer's best monster series.

This movie was released by two company's. One from Australia (purple artwork on the cover) and this one directly from the U.K..

For those who like these kind of details  . . .

The Australian version of this film is coded 25 frames per second which means even though the Blu-Ray disc itself is Region free, the movie will not play on a U.S. Blu-Ray player because U.S. players cannot play 25 fps Blu-Ray authored discs. If you have a Region Free Blu-Ray player then this is not a problem. If you have an off the shelf store bought Blu-Ray player then the movie will not play.

This version (the U.K. version) was coded 24 frames per second which can be played on a U.S. Blu-Ray player but the disc is Region B locked meaning a U.S. player cannot see the disc.

I have both and I think the U.K. version is visually cleaner and I think the reason for that is they must have mistakenly re-coded the movie file for the Australian version seeing how it is the wrong frame rate for a Region Free Blu-Ray authored disc.",1502064000,4,1076,4.355
