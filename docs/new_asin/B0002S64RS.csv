8368241,1,B0002S64RS,"That title (""Dear Lord"") could easily apply for many movies, but few would be as deserving as King Midas. It is a terrible movie. People forget their lines, lines which weren't anywhere close to decent to begin with, production values are awful, and, perhaps worst of all, the filmakers take themselves seriously. A few highlights:
-seeing the sound editor/occasional camera man get his hand placed into a meat grinder
-an eight minute stripclub scene culminating in a semi-nude woman scratching herself for a good minute
AND
-a man getting his leg ""blown off"" (hilarious"")",1116115200,3,573,5.1063829787234045
