2906609,5,B000TLTCT0,"20th Century Fox doesnt immediately spring to mind when ""Classic horror films"" are mentioned, but the studio produced several ""Films Noir"" in the 1940s that have become classics, such as ""Laura"" and ""Nightmare Alley"", and the 3 films in this collection are no exception. Directed by German-born John Brahm, ""The Undying Monster"", ""The Lodger"", and ""Hangover Square"" have a great deal of moody Germanic expressionism at their core. The first, ""The Undying Monster"" is the only one with a ""supernatural"" theme, which involves a turn of the century British family living under a centuries-old curse. A sort of hybrid ""Nick and Nora Charles meet the Wolf Man of the Baskervilles"", this modestly budgeted but very handsome-looking film runs a scant 63 minutes, and features a predominantly British cast, in which the viewer will spot several familiar character actors such as Heather Thatcher, Halliwell Hobbes, Aubrey Mather,  and Holmes Herbert, as well as leading lady Heather Angel and Americans James Ellison and John Howard. The film is fun stuff, and moves at a quick pace, with beautiful cinematography by Lucien Ballard and a musical score by David (""Laura"") Raksin and Cyril Mockridge. ""The Lodger"", based on the famous novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes, is, of course, about Jack the Ripper, and is, in my opinion, the best film ever made on the subject. I think it is superior to the silent version, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, as it sticks to the original novel, where the title character is INDEED Jack the Ripper.  Laird Cregar, who plays the titular role, brings a disturbing and very sad quality to the character of a man, driven by deep, violent emotions, to kill actresses (this was the era of the Hayes Code, where one couldn't say ""prostitutes"", tho actresses were equated with prostitutes in Victorian England anyhow!), and his performance is haunting, unforgettable, and downright frightening. Merle Oberon, looking absolutely gorgeous, is the object of Cregar's obsession, and plays the role of glamorous dancehall queen Kitty Langley with great charm. George Sanders, Sir Cedric Hardwick, Sara Allgood, Aubrey Mather, and other familiar British faces round out the cast in this very dark, sad, and disturbing film. Lucien Ballard's cinematography is moody and evocative (and very flattering to his wife, Merle Oberon), and Hugo Friedhofer's score is creepily effective. ""Hangover Square"", based on Patrick Hamilton's novel (it barely resembles the novel!), was made to capitalize on ""The Lodger""'s success. Cregar plays turn-of-the-century composer Harvey Bone, who suffers amnesiac episodes brought on by stress and jarring noises, and commits murders during them. Falling prey to beautiful, sluttish, and selfish dance hall diva Netta Longden (a gorgeous Linda Darnell, in the 'bad girls' phase of her career), Bone's mental state becomes increasingly worse, driving him to murder Netta, and he meets his end in a burning mansion, playing his ""Concerto Macabre"", as the house burns around him. This film is very ""fatally romantic"", dark and brooding, with an air of tragedy that hangs over it like a stormcloud. Bernard Herrmann's score, with its chilling piano ""Concerto Macabre"", is unforgettable (the first 8 bars of the concerto left an indelible impression on a young Stephen Sondheim), and has since been recorded many times. The film itself seems to predict the terrible fate of Linda Darnell, who died in a house fire in 1965 (Cregar places her body on a bonfire on Guy Fawkes Day), and of course Cregar, who died shortly after the film was completed. In his efforts to slim down to ""Leading Man Size"", Cregar dieted and lost a vast amount of weight, even undergoing surgery, but his heart failed him and he died, aged 28. This boxed set is a love letter, to put it mildly. The films look absolutely magnificent, due to a fine restoration process. I have seen these films many times, but upon seeing the DVDs, it was like looking at completely new films, rich in detail, with rich blacks and greys. There are several extras as well, including radio shows of ""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" featuring Fox player Vincent Price (who delivered the eulogy at Laird Cregar's funeral), commentaries by Richard Schickel, Faye Marlowe, Alain Silver, James Ursini, and Steve Haberman, restoration comparisons, advertising and still photo galleries, and the featurettes ""Concerto Macabre: The Films of John Brahm"", ""The Man in the Attic: The Making of The Lodger"", and ""The Tragic Mask: The Laird Cregar Story"". I have waited and prayed for these 3 remarkable films to be released on DVD (they were never even released on VHS!), and it makes me happy to know that they have been restored and available to people who remember them with fondness and admiration like myself, and for people who have never seen them. Bravo, Fox!",1195516800,8,4844,5.11489898989899
2906610,4,B000TLTCT0,"This DVD collection contains 3 films from 20th Century Fox directed by German John Brahm. It would have been better if called the John Brahm Collection because only one of the films is really of the horror genre, the other 2 being psychological thrillers. The package is not as good as it might have been if a greater variety of films had been included.

""The Undying Monster"" is a classy B picture with great photography, some excellent sets and a mobile camera worthy of an A. The film betrays its B status with the woeful James Ellison badly miscast as a Scotland Yard forensic expert and a melodramatic plot set in a dark house by the sea. Brahm's direction is very good in the circumstances and there are some good isolated scenes but overall, the effect is a bit corny and the plot development is truncated as befits a B film.

The other films are two book ends starring the enigmatic Laird Cregar. Cregar was a superb character actor with a complex and short life which is described in a very worthwhile documentary included in the package.

""The Lodger"" is Brahm's version of Jack the Ripper with a dose of ""Phantom of the Opera"". Since it is obvious that Cregar plays the Ripper, the film relies on its camera angles, moody lighting and psychological implications for its suspense. Merle Oberon is the leading lady. Oberon was a wooden English actress with a clipped hostess delivery and stylish presence. As usual, she does not project much personality. She performs 2 musical hall numbers, with poor lip-synching, and one famous critic said ""Merle Oberon performs the Can Can. Might we call it the Can't Can't"" - hilarious but a bit harsh. With the exception of Cregar's towering performance, I find the film strangely detached and uninvolving and a number of the sets are 2 dimensional.

""Hangover Square"" is the best film in this package. Cregar was unhappy because the screenplay changed the settings of the novel among other things and it was obvious that Darryl F. Zanuck, never one to miss an opportunity to repeat a success, transformed it into a sequel to ""The Lodger"" with a dose of ""Of Human Bondage"". Cregar plays a schizophrenic composer and gives a masterly portrayal. Linda Darnell plays the slut who seduces him and she is very good in her typical artificial way even if  she squeals in moments of enthusiasm. She is spectacularly photographed and her beauty was never more lush. The film touches on film noir with the lighting and low slung camera angles and particularly in Darnell's performance.

The prints of the films are very good although I was surprised by an obvious tear in ""Hangover Square"" and the appearance of a white vertical line at one point. The DVD contains a generous list of extras including trailers, stills and some worthwhile commentaries with the exception of Richard Schickel's pointless commentary on ""Hangover Square"". Schickel needs a shot of adrenalin. He sounds as if he is half asleep and many of his comments are cursory.  Maybe the producers of the DVD realized because ""Hangover Square"" actually has 2 commentaries and the other one  is far superior. Charming Faye Marlowe who had a supporting role in the film speaks to an excellent historian. Her memory is vivid and she adds an unusual personal touch, a rare occurrence with a classic film since most of the participants are usually dead of course.

Overall, the value of this set is in the preservation of Laird Cregar's impressive acting. The rest is secondary.",1194998400,9,3478,4.812395309882747
2906611,1,B000TLTCT0,"Based on a review somewhere, I bought the collection for Halloween. The Lodger was the show I really wanted to watch.  Oh please.  Maybe in 1944 that was scary stuff.  Nowadays...hmmm.  No.  Nada.  Yawn.",1193788800,,203,4.823529411764706
2906612,5,B000TLTCT0,"The Fox set of classic films are just great.
The Lodger remake from 44' is awesome and
one of the better Jack the Ripper movies made.
Hangover Square has most of same cast as Lodger
and is more film noir/mystery than horror but
also very well made. Better than most. Undying

well made and acted. I highly recommend this set.",1193788800,19,421,4.341772151898734
2906613,4,B000TLTCT0,"THE LODGER is a classic. But THE UNDYING MONSTER is a weak B film and HANGOVER SQUARE - though most critics rave about it - is simply a tepid remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But THE LODGER...

Everything is right here. The cast is outstanding. Merle Oberon was never more beautiful. And Laird Cregar gives the performance of a lifetime. This film can be seen over and over. It, alone, is worth the price of the box.

THE LODGER is also one of the sexiest films ever made. Give it to yourself for Christmas present. You won't be disappointed.",1193616000,4,544,4.376237623762377
2906614,4,B000TLTCT0,"Titling this collection of thrillers from director John Brahm is misleading because only one of the films, ""The Undying Monster"", has a remotely supernatural element to it.  That said, there's much to recommend here because these films are masterfully directed and highly literate.  It would behoove the viewer to check this set out and the Val Lewton box set that Warners released a few years back as examples of intelligently made chillers.  Two of the films also showcase the prodigious talents of Laird Cregar, who died tragically young.  His work here in ""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" are his best work along with his role as a dogged detective in the noir classic, ""I Wake Up Screaming"".
""The Lodger""-A good film with a superb turn by Cregar as a mysterious pathologist.  A lot of creepy atmosphere but the mystery in this Jack the Ripper tale is obvious and telegraphed early on. Four stars.
""Hangover Square""-The best of the three films by far.  Cregar gives probably his best performance as the tormented composer with a possible split personality.  Brahm perfectly captures the eeriness of turn-of-the-century London.  Dynamic Bernard Herrmann score.  The ending is a classic.  Five stars.
""The Undying Monster""-The weakest entry in the bunch.  Even at it's sixty-three minute running time there's a lot of filler.  Film concerns a family with a dark secret being investigated by Scotland Yard in the wake of a murder.  Intelligent but long-winded.  Three stars.",1193529600,10,1477,5.1
2906615,5,B000TLTCT0,attn: let's not forget that the HANGOVER SQUARE CONCERTO was composed for this wonderful film by Bernard Herrmann...hello?,1191801600,6,122,5.833333333333333
2906616,5,B000TLTCT0,"Three little known but effective horror films from a major hollywood studio complete this box set. Last year MGM released some of their little known horror films and now Fox has followed suite.
None of the these titles have been on DVD before, and even rarely on VHS. They occasionally showed up on the lackluster Fox Movie Channel a few years ago at odd hours of the early morning. It was on such an occasion that I encountered ""The Lodger"". This is a top notch effort which rests comfortably between the Gaslight thriller and the classic horror film. Cregar plays the villain with an off kilter, understated creepiness that was way ahead of it's time and could be called the screen's first serial killer performance.
The cinematography looks better and more atmospheric than what Universal was shoving out in the mid 40s'. Fog bound London streets and dimly gaslit interiors play with the viewers sense of claustrophobia. You almost feel as trapped by the heavy atmosphere as Cregar's character. Lodger is no doubt a lost classic of psychological horror.

I have to disagree with other reviewers that ""Undying Monster"" is the poor cousin of this set. ""Hangover Square"" feels more like a re-make of Lodger than a film of its own right. But Undying Monster takes us to the dark, atmospheric Sea coast. The sparse sets and jagged cliffs and caves work beautifully here. We have Jane Eyre meets Bram Stoker. A family curse is the plot engine to drive the lush monochrome cinematography. In fact Undying Monster boasts some of the best shots of the set, particularly the opening interior shot as the moon streams into a tudor drawing room. It looked great on the badly duped VHS copy I've had for years. On DVD it promises to be stunning. The titular Monster is not revealed until near the end, so forget about it and soak up the atmosphere. There is an interesting sequence near the end, all done in long shot as if you were a passerby. It's effective and helps cover the lack of make up talent Fox had for horror films.
These films were rarely seen even back in the days of Late Night Creature Features. Universal's films are better known, and MGM's more highly regarded by critics. But these lost Fox Horror films can now find an audience of their own and be appreciated for the loving cinematography.
If you're tired of the bad Hollywood ""horror"" films lately, which bear more resemblance to a series of snuff films rather than anything else, this box set is for you. Curl up on your couch with the DVD remote clutched in your hand. Be sure to darken the room, and quiet the mind. The intelligence and atmosphere of these gothic horrors will soon overcome the decades they have sat waiting in Fox's vault to return to the screen.",1191283200,104,2730,4.675675675675675
2906617,5,B000TLTCT0,"Fox has been taking a play from Warner Home Video on how to package their classics. They've been making a habit of adding commentary and extras to their classics, and this group is no exception. What you have here is two very good classic horror movies from the 1940's and one mediocre one, all newly restored and remastered. ""The Undying Monster"" is just not that interesting. The movie introduces all of these strange characters, and has you thinking something interesting is going to happen when in the end it is all too ordinary. Horror films that are campy and Ed Wood bad tend to be more satisfying than the ones that are just ordinary. At least that's my opinion. The list of extras for this set keeps appearing and disappearing from the product description, so at this point I'm just listing the Fox Home Video press release for this set. Also, I've listed the rating of each film as given by a popular internet film database. It's been my experience anything above 7/10 is very good and anything above five is OK/mediocre.

The magic of these films is Brahm's direction. His use of light and shadows is excellent and give what are essentially low budget thrillers an ambiance that a lot of bigger films lack. If you enjoy the old Universal films; you'll be impressed with these three. Well worth the price even if you're taking a chance like I was.

2906627,5,B000TLTCT0,"This is an excellent collection of movies. It may say Horror but they really are thrillers. Even Undying Monster is more mystery than out and out horror. All three are excellent.
The Lodge is  Ripper tale that stars Laird Cregar in a great performance. Merle Oberon is in it as the female lead(victim). Atmospheric and well paced. The performance by Cregar is Enhanced by top notch direction by John Brahm. Brahm is an often over looked director who did a vast collection of films and TV shows. He has done a wonderful job on this film.
Hangover Square is another Cregar outing where he stars as the hero/villain of the movie. Linda Darnell almost seals the show as a pub singer who is not to be trusted. Again Brahm was at the helm and the film is a minor masterpiece.
The Undying Monster is the most fun of the set and horror fans will enjoy the thrill ride provided by Brahm who also directs this wonderful B movie,
The whole set is a great way to spend a couple of nights being entertained in the noir style of John Brahm. The set should be called the John Brahm set but as I noted he was not as widely known as others. I believe that is why 20th went with the horror chant even though Lodger and Hangover are more psychological thrillers than out right horror.
Brahm continued in the TV realm with episodes in Thriller and other cult and horror shows of the 60's. If you have never seen these films they are well worth any thriller fan's time they are all well made and entertaining. Great set at a good price.

THE LODGER has been recognized by film historians and some critics as the definitive ""Jack the Ripper"" film. Look beyond the horror to find an outstanding performance by star Laird Cregar. Cregar's performance plus a well-written script give a human face to one of history's most famous serial killers. HANGOVER SQUARE is not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be about an alcoholic. Far from it. It dramatizes the story of a distinguished British composer who happens to live in that oddly-named vicinity. Some film historians like it even better than the aforementioned film. Both films star Laird Cregar. The third film is really a mystery/horror movie. It was originally going to be titled The Hammond Mystery, but I suppose THE UNDYING MONSTER was a title Fox believed would bring in higher grosses at the box office. Don't let the title put you off.

This collection could also be called a John Brahm box set as he is the director of all three. The only real horror film of the bunch is The Undying Monster which was obviously inspired by Universal's The Wolf Man of the previous year. The Lodger is the second remake of Mrs Belloc-Lowndes Jack the Ripper novel, Hitchcock having directed the original silent in the twenties and the first remake made as a sound film in 1930. This version was very successful, enough so that Hollywood followed its old adage. ""If at first you do succeed, film it again."" which is what happened with Hangover Square.

2906641,4,B000TLTCT0,"John Brahm and Laird Cregar provide the thrills in this Fox Horror Classics Collection, which features three horror films directed by Brahm, two of which star Cregar, and one of which, ""The Lodger,"" is a classic. Brahm only directed feature films at Fox for a few years before finishing his career in television, but these three movies show his mastery of visual composition.

The Undying Monster (**) - ""Monster,"" made in 1942, plays like a cross between the previous year's ""The Wolf Man"" and the Basil Rathbone version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" An English family living in the desolate countryside is beset by what may be wolf or werewolf attacks. A London detective investigates, and he relies on scientific methods to find what he is convinced is a rational explanation for the earlier attack. For a while, the film plays out like a very bad Sherlock Holmes movie, with its own buffoonish female assistant and various characters vying to appear as suspicious as possible.

Fortunately, the movie's only about an hour long, and eventually the monster reappears and carries off the heiress, leading to a climactic chase through the marshes and woods. It's only in this climactic action sequence that the film comes alive. Brahm was a master at creating stunning black & white visuals, and he manages to turn a routine chase, a ridiculous plot, and a cheesy monster into a few minutes of exciting viewing. It's just too bad viewers have to sit through 45 minutes of dreck to get there.

The Lodger (****) - ""The Lodger"" is a classic retelling of the Jack the Ripper story, brilliantly photographed, with a chilling lead performance by Cregar. While the Ripper murders are terrorizing London, a mysterious stranger named Slade (Cregar) rents a room from a middle class couple (Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood) that's down on its luck financially. Thanks to Slade's late hours and generally creepy behavior, it becomes clear to viewers, although not the family, that he's the Ripper. Despite this, the couple's niece, Kitty (Merle Oberon), a dance hall performer, befriends Slade, who, in turn, has a soft spot for her. The question eventually becomes whether police inspector George Sanders, who's sweet on Kitty himself, can get the goods on Slade before he turns on Kitty.

As with many of the horror films of that era, ""The Lodger"" isn't really scary (and it's certainly not gory as a modern film would be), but it does build suspense, and it's always fascinating to watch due to Cregar's performance and the many amazing black & white compositions that director Brahm and cinematographer Lucien Ballard assemble. The camera work and use of light and shadow produce one memorable shot after another. In the meantime, Cregar dominates the screen, at first a seemingly mild man with a fear an distrust of women, especially actresses, but gradually becoming more and more unhinged. Cregar almost always played screen villains, but this was by far his most memorable performance.

Hangover Square (*** 1/2) - After the success of ""The Lodger,"" Brahm and Cregar tried to duplicate their success with ""Hangover Square,"" which borrowed extensively from ""The Lodger."" The second time around, however, the results were decidedly mixed.

""Hangover Square"" was Cregar's first and last starring role before his tragic death shortly after filming completed. Cregar plays Geoge Bone, a composer in turn of the century England who blacks out when he hears discordant noises and winds up becoming a killer. Bone is unaware of what he has done, but events in his life lead him to commit murder again. The cause of his downfall is a beautiful lounge singer, Netta (Linda Darnell), who flirts with Bone so he will write songs for her.

The story line of ""Hangover Square"" isn't nearly as compelling as ""The Lodger,"" in large part because it's not about history's most infamous serial killer, but about a meek fictional composer who eventually snaps. Despite the rather flimsy plot, Cregar and Brahm are at the top of their game. Cregar is more restrained and less obviously creepy than he was in ""The Lodger,"" and he manages to make Bone more of a sad figure. Brahm is able to put together some stunning black & white camera sequences, most notably a scene in which Bone disposes of a victim by wrapping up the corpse and throwing it on a Guy Fawkes Night bonfire.

Finally, the film boasts a haunting, powerful score by Bernard Herrmann, who composed an entire concerto for Bone to play at the film's climax. ""Hangover Square"" is worthwhile viewing for the sight and sound of it and for Cregar's performance, despite the story weakness.

Each movie comes in its own snapcase, and the collection has some impressive extras. There are three featurettes on Brahm's career, Cregar's career, and the making of ""The Lodger,"" an audio commentary by film historians on ""The Lodger"" and two on ""Hangover Square,"" one of which also features actress Faye Marlowe, who was 17 when she made ""Hangover Square""; and radio broadcasts of dramatizations of ""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square,"" both featuring Vincent Price in Cregar's roles. The extra features, plus the added value of assembling all three films in one package, gives this collection easily a four-star rating.",1391990400,,5256,4.984036488027366

Sadly it was the zenith of his career ( luckily he finally agreed to do it, after being upset with the studio changing the story from the original that he had wanted to do )with no films following as he died due in part to a plan to drastically lose weight ( & later get some plastic surgery ) in hopes of doing romantic leading roles ( I suspect fueled by his not embracing his homosexuality- he dreamt of doing what Rock Hudson later successfully did: posing as heterosexual to mainstream society ).

Laird Creger does a wonderful job in the Lodger. Troubled, cautious and just plain creepy. the movie is based loosely based on the ""Ripper"" case, but the murders become the secondary to the Lodger character and those around him.

2906675,5,B000TLTCT0,"If, you thought that James Dean died to young.  Laird Cregar (1913-1944) at 31, was just getting started on a stellar career.  His film career was capped by his definitive Jack the Ripper role in The Lodger (1944). Investing the psychotic role, it is intense with gripping realism. He led a brilliantly seasoned cast with Merle Oberon and George Sanders. His death scene in the film, was one of the Greatest ever in any film and you will never forget it, but it would forever stereotype him as a villain. Unfortunately, his early death robbed film audiences of seeing what course Laird's career would have taken. Sure enough, his last celluloid offering in Hangover Square (1945) was as another despicable character with murder on its maniacal mind. Top-lining a cast that included Linda Darnell (as an object of his affection), and George Sanders, he portrayed a temperamental composer who suffers from a split personality disorder and, prone to periodic blackouts, and commits brutal murders. Another compelling death scene had his mad character wildly pounding out a concerto while the room around him goes up in flames and the ceiling crashes down on him.

Laird's obsession with avoiding the inevitable stereotype as a ""heavy heavy"" and wistful pursuit of a romantic leading man career compelled him to go on a reckless, unsupervised crash diet (from 300 lbs to 200 lbs), which is evident by his drastically trimmed-down look in his last film. This proved too strenuous on his system and he was forced to undergo surgery for a severe stomach disorder. His 31-year-old heart gave out on the morning of December 9, 1944, only days after his operation.
I found The Undying Monster the weakest of the Three Films.  With its' main players being destine to be ""B"" actors of the small TV screen, except Heather Angel but she turns in a ""B"" performance in this film.  A Wolf Man wannabe that does not come close to top horror film, which is a true Classic, as only Universal Studios could make.  Any other Werewolf film is just pale by comparison to The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney Jr..
Bottomline this is a must have Collection for the true Horror/Drama/Thriller Fan.",1313884800,3,2162,4.845528455284553
2906676,4,B000TLTCT0,"A trio of atmospheric mystery-horror noirs from 20th Century Fox Studios and all directed by John Brahm. They are devoid of the blood and guts that most look for these days, but instead are replete with style, visual richness, marvelous performances and artistic direction despite familiar storylines. The psychological horror moves the viewer more than any murder, especially in HANGOVER SQUARE. Although I enjoyed watching each, connosseurs of these low-to-moderate-budget genre films from the 40's may be a trifle disappointed with each, as I was. I am not saying this in a negative way, however, as I became so engaged with each film that I was left wanting more---spoiled by what I saw and wanting things that Brahm's budget probably did not permit.

HANGOVER SQUARE, [1945]:
Instead of discussing these films chronologically, or in the order they were presented in the set, I prefer to begin with the highlight of this boxset: the GREAT performance of Laird Cregar in HANGOVER SQUARE. I must admit I had never heard of this marvelous actor before---thus, the magic of taking a chance and watching a film one has never seen. Cregar plays George Harvey Bone, a lonely writer and composer of music who seems to go into a fugue when exposed to sudden, loud sounds---turning into a murderous fiend.  Like Universal's landmark template THE WOLFMAN, 1941, he does not recall his actions during his state but, unlike the lycanthrope, he does not transform but instead retains his human form---and human maladies. Bone is a large yet gentle  man but also gauche and nave, isolation and monotony depriving him of the social mettle needed to cope and to survive. His world is small, consisting of his solitude, his work and the obsessions that follow. He always seems to be uncomfortable---with his face, his body, his insides, his gender?

He has two female interests here: Barbara, his mentor's daughter and a co-classical musician, played by a pristinely beautiful but little-known actress named Faye Marlowe; and, Netta, a music-hall dancer played by a robustly beautiful Linda Darnell [MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, 1946]. Barbara admires George and wants to help him but Netta is using him for her own gain, feigning affection so that George can continue to compose music for her stageshows. Unfortunately, yielding to his dark and askew tendencies, George is attracted to Netta and shuns the security and certitude he has with Barbara.

The visual highlight in this film is the town bonfire, an annual mountainous piling of dummies and dolls and other inanimate objects in the center of town to be set on fire at night.  After discovering that Netta is unfaithful Bone murders her. He disposes of the body by placing a shroud and mask on her and carrying her body up a ladder and placing it at the apex. The townspeople, unwitting accomplices, set the pile on fire. This is a macabre and mesmerizing scene with a clear Hitchcockian touch and a possible influence on the final scene in THE WICKER MAN [1973]. Unsettling to think that actress Darnell actually perished in a fire many years later.

As Scotland Yard closes in Bone is preparing to play his finest composition in public. On that night he is arrested while playing his piano but escapes and sets the place accidentally on fire. As the crowd storms out he returns to his piano to complete his piece. Eerie hearing the sounds of the piano, from across the street, emanating from within the conflagration. Cregar delivers a sensitive and profound performance thoroughly immersing himself in his role. His performance  befitted a much greater film, the latter not possible because of the budgetary constraints. Look closely for Glenn Langan [yes, THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, 1957] as Netta's love interest.

THE LODGER, [1944]:
THE LODGER featured another superb performance by the unheralded Cregar. This one is a basic Jack-the-ripper story with Cregar coming from the dark mists to rent a room and an attic in a town stricken by the terror of the nocturnal murders. Again, he plays a lonely man with a disturbed mindset. However, here he is supported by some fine, sensitive, John Ford-like characterizations especially the husband and wife renters played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke [THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, 1956] and Sara Allgood [HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, 1941]. The lodger has specific victims---actresses or showgirls---and a specific motive: revenge for the death of his brother who was misguided by such a woman. He appears to have a perverse fixation with his deceased sibling and with water [specifically the deep and dark water of the Thames River]. The lodger, who believes his acts are justified, uses water to cleanse and calm himself after each crime, unlike HANGOVER SQUARE where the killer perceives his acts as uncontrollable and not justified, with obliteration by fire deemed the only remedy.

THE UNDYING MONSTER, [1942]:
While HANGOVER SQUARE and THE LODGER were morose, melancholic films [especially the former], THE UNDYING MONSTER was actually quite lots of fun. This was about murders occurring on the estate of a family with a family curse---a remote history of lycanthropy---and the forensic team out to solve them. Actor John Ellison [with Gary Cooper in THE PLAINSMAN, 1936] and actress Heather Thatcher form a disparate but energetic and funny investigative duo---their lighthearted banter in the face of an unsolved murder was refreshing and engaging---sort of a Sherlock Holmes and female Watson. Too bad the two didn't go on to do similar stuff together after this as the chemistry and talent were ostensibly there. THE UNDYING MONSTER is the most atmospheric and visually rich of the films with lots of nocturnal howling and fog, screams in the night, unpaved winding roads, rocky surf and a huge Cathedral-like mansion with a family crypt. Employees of the estate, and locals with special interests and disdain for the cursed family, are suspects as the curse is deemed to be hogwash by both officials and family members. See who the murderer is yourself. The 'monster's' face is hardly seen at all until the end, and the effects were unintentionally farcical, but you should enjoy this splendid production with the stereotypic plot but the added originality of the insouciant and facetious CSI-like investigators. Look closely for an uncredited Charles McGraw [SPARTACUS, 1960 and THE BIRDS, 1963], a familiar face in a myriad of noteworthy films, in his first movie role.

I am very happy to have this boxset in my collection as should any fan of these types of movies from that time. Again, be ready for some signs and symptoms of an abated budget, namely, underdevelopment [of plots and emerging subplots], over or under-editing, truncation, poor or no special effects and hasty and/or clumsy endings. However, must laud Brahm and Co. for what they were able to do with fixed sets, marvelous performers, deft direction and lots of moxie from all.",1289692800,,6931,5.060420315236427
2906677,5,B000TLTCT0,"If I might take a somewhat different tack... This set is not only an homage to Laird Cregar, but to John Brahm, a German director who came to the US to escape the Nazis.

It's tempting to call Brahm a poor man's Hitchcock, but that would be misleading and unfair. Brahm had his own distinctive style, with unsymmetrical and off-kilter framing, and highly dramatic lighting. He also infuses his films with tremendous energy. By comparison, Michael Curtiz is positively torpid.

""The Undying Monster"" is the weak film in this batch. It's beautifully photographed (and that's an understatement), but Brahm's rapid pace occasionally gets in the way of understanding who-did-what-to-whom-and-why. And James Ellison's dreadfully LOUD and overbearing performance as a Scotland Yard investigator almost torpedoes the film. (It's surprising the sets remained standing.) ""The Undying Monster"" comes across as one of those awful horror/mystery films of the 30s (eg, ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"") helmed by a wildly talented director. Two stars out of four.

The others are classics. ""The Lodger"" is a nominal remake of Hitchcock's silent version. There's no harm in saying it's better than the Hitchcock, because it is. Sound makes it possible for a good actor to create a subtlety of characterization impossible in a silent film. * And Laird Cregar was a great actor. Brahm supposedly let Cregar do what he wanted, and he delivers.

Brahm does, too. When Cregar jumps out of the window into the river, the effect (for its era) is not unlike the Millenium Falcon jumping to hyperspace. Three stars out of four.

""Hangover Square"" is, by a narrow margin, the best of the three, possibly because of Bernard Herrmann's remarkable score. Though it was written before filming began, the last few minutes work perfectly with scenes of a mansion burning down. The images seem almost tailored to the music, rather than the other way around. The fire is beyond spectacular; Darryl Zanuck must have been biting his nails over the possibility it might get out of control and kill Cregar. (It's amazing he didn't die of smoke inhalation.) Three and a half stars out of four.

Not enough can be said about these films' magnificent B&W cinematography, some of the finest I've ever seen. B&W can be much more expressive than color -- note, for example, how characters move in an out of the light, or have their eyes lightened or darkened, to great effect. This can be done in color, or course, but it's more ""obvious"" and less abstract. The scene in which Cregar shuffles across the gratings in the theater and the light coming through them ripples across his face is unforgettable.

* Note Norma Desmond's remark that ""We had faces, then."" Laird Cregar's performance is a perfect rebuttal to that.",1283299200,4,2771,4.984848484848484

To me, ""Hangover Square"" was easily the best of three films offered here in this ""Horror Classics  Collection,""  so I'll limit my reivew to it. That's not to trash the other two films, by the way. They can stand on their own, too.

As for HS,, the story settles in for awhile and you have to stick with it. If you're used to modern movies, you'll get bored but if you hang around ""Hangover Square"" to where the main figure commits his second crime, the rest of the film gets better and better from that point. So does the direction and the photography. Kudos to Director John Brahm for a variety of interesting angles, from floor level to above-ceiling, through peep holes and anywhere else he could think of to shoot the scene.

If you're a fan of film noir, Cinematographer Josesph LaShelle's work here will keep you enthralled. Once he gets rolling, scene after scene is jaw-dropping in his array of lights and shadows - superb stuff.  These are really mysteries, more than horror films.

Laird Cregar is mesmerizing as ""George Harvey Bone,"" a demented composer who, upon hearing discordant notes, literally goes insane and gets violent, intending to choke the life out of the last person who got him upset. What a shame the young Cregar never lived to see his great performance on screen. (Check out the 20-minute bonus feature of Cregar's career on this disc; it's fascinating.)

 The fact that the actor is still talked about in reverent tones in Hollywood some 60 years after his death, is a testimony to his acting prowess. particularly since his career was so short. Linda Darnell adds a lot of sex appeal and evilness to ""Hangover Square"" and George Sanders - surprise - plays a good guy. How often do you see that?

2906693,4,B000TLTCT0,"3 films from the 20th Century Fox vaults that i'm proud to add to my dvd collection. Two of the films, The Lodger and Hangover Square, features the very underrated Laird Cregar in what I believe were his only 2 starring roles. What a fantastic actor this gentleman was and thankfully with the release of this box set, will always be. Other reviews have revealed the films storylines so I won't go into that. IMO Mr. Cregars own tortured private life spills over into his acting in both films which also adds a note of sadness and sympathy to both performances. With beautiful leading ladies, Merle Oberon in The Lodger and Linda Darnell in Hangover Square plus the exquisite b/w photography of foggy victorian England make both of these films a winner in my book. I also enjoyed the commentary of Hangover Square featuring the second leading lady of  that film, Faye Marlowe. The only other work I have seen Miss Marlowe in is Fox's 1945 hit Junior Miss with Peggy Ann Garner. It's a treat to hear her take on the studio system and her very short film career. Not to mention what a lovely young lady she was.  The third film in this box set is one I had never seen or even heard of. The Undying Monster. A ""B"" picture that is as classy looking as any ""A"" production I have seen. The film stars ""B"" leading actors James Ellison and Heather Angel. Miss Angel is one of my favorites who also had good roles in The Informer, Pride and Prejudice and Cry Havoc. Spooky atmosphere, a gothic castle on a cliff and first rate b/w photography imo make this little gem as good as any of the classic horror flicks that Universal was making at the time.

2906695,4,B000TLTCT0,"I've always enjoyed watching gothic horror.  Large, spooky houses, swirling fog, unsolved murders, and killers creeping through the dark excite me.  The ""Fox Horror Classics"" is a collection of gothic horror masterpieces directed by legendary director John Brahm.  There are three horror movies presented on three discs, each one loaded with extras.  I have reviewed each one according to the year in which it was released.

The Undying Monster  (1942)  ***

  It's a shame, but ""The Undying Monster"" had a lot of potential to be more than it was.  However, at a length of only sixty three minutes, it left me unfulfilled.  The body count could have been much higher.  Maybe, because of the censors, the violence was kept to a minimum.  Several maids, a butler, and a couple of poachers could have possibly met gruesome fates at the hands of the monster.  Everything else was there to make ""The Undying Monster"" a great gothic horror masterpiece:  the enormous, gloomy mansion by the raging sea, swirling mists, steep, craggy cliffs, and a horrifying family secret involving Satan worship and a burial crypt.  The acting was great.  Unfortunately, the two romantic leads, played by James Ellison and Heather Angel, never united at the end.  This feature is for diehard fans of lycanthropy.

The Lodger  (1944)  ****

  ""The Lodger"" has been haled as one of the greatest horror movies of the 1940s, and I can understand why.  A gothic period piece, ""The Lodger"" is set in 1888 when the notorious Jack the Ripper is killing actresses in White Chapel.  Because of the censors, the word ""prostitute"" wasn't allowed.  This is a great variation on the Jack the Ripper legend.  A family allows a young doctor to move in, not suspecting that he is the notorious serial killer.  Laird Cregar delivers an excellent performance as Slade, the pre-""Psycho,"" sex-obsessed maniac who is depicted as a monster in movie posters and bares a striking resemblance to a vampire.  The director liked Cregar's performance so much that he gave him the lead in ""Hangover Square,"" where he plays a similar character.  If you enjoy gothic horror and the mystique of Jack the Ripper, you will definitely want to see this feature.

Hangover Square  (1945)  *****

  ""Hangover Square"" is my type of horror movie.  Another gothic masterpiece, this one is set in 1912 and has a good body count with more graphic, unique death sequences.  Victims are stabbed and strangled and set afire.  One lying, deceitful villainous (played by Linda Darnell) is strangled and then placed on top of an enormous bonfire.  Again Laird Cregar delivers an excellent performance as another psychotic.  This time he is composer George Harvey Brown who suffers from amnesia.  He murders during these ""spells.""  The ending is one of the saddest, most disturbing I've ever seen because one can't help but feel sympathy towards the pathetic, abused Brown.  This is a must see for fans of gothic slasher horror.

  Overall, the ""Fox Horror Classics"" is a great addition to anyone's collection of gothic horror.  While watching it, you will learn how director John Brahm influenced horror cinema.  Numerous imitations of his movies have been made over the years.  I only wish these features had been presented in color and widescreen format.  In this way, they would have been more like the Hammer productions which I greatly cherish.",1211846400,3,3376,4.9784172661870505
2906696,4,B000TLTCT0,"Really excellent visit to two rather obscure Fox ""A"" pieces that seldom seem to make it to tv, at least before this release.
HANGOVER and THE LODGER aren't really horror movies in the usual sense, but Gay 90's melodramas with big over-the-top, hambone performances from Cregar at their center. HANGOVER has a great score by Herrmann which reportedly was the inspiration for Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD.
I really liked both of them, but had a real fondness for HANGOVER. I saw them tv in the 60s and always wanted to catch them again. Cinemax showed the both in the 80s, but they have been little seen since. The fox movie network showed LODGER a couple of times, but I requested HANGOVER a million times and came up with nothing.
Presentation is superior. Picture quality is fine, and there's supposed to be a stereo makeover, but you'd never notice it. The commentaries for both are excellent and are done by people who like and understand the films, a rare occasion, these days.
The third film is of little interest except it shares the same director. It's old dark house junk, not worthy of inclusion, otherwise.
Calling them ""horror classics"" is a misnomer for sure. The two major titles would fit as noirs as easily as anything; dark, black and white, psychotic people doing wacko stuff. Recommended.",1207353600,3,1301,4.8125
2906697,4,B000TLTCT0,"THE UNDYING MONSTER is the first horror film I ever saw on TV as a very young boy and helped give me my lifelong appetite for classic horror.  The remastered UNDYING MONSTER was the clearest copy I have ever witnessed since that first night well over fifty years ago.

This three-disk collection of classic horror and suspense thrillers from the Fox Studios presents three atmospheric and generally unknown thrillers (e.g., The Lodger, Hangover Square and The Undying Monster) in absolutely beautiful remastered formats.  It also pays homage to the directing skills of the very talented John Brahm.

Although this film was made in the Universal tradition, it has many wonderful qualities including an original musical score, excellent cast, good special effects, fine interior and exterior sets and a plot that kept me interested in what happened to the characters.  Of course, the make up was not as effective as in almost any of the Universal movies because of the wonderful work of Jack Pierce of that studio. This is attested to by the fact that the appearance of the monster is not even hinted at until the poorly lit but climactic ending.  As my first horror movie this film was a magical experience of my youth and the excellent DVD transfer enables me to experience that evening over and over again.",1203552000,6,1307,4.891402714932127
2906698,2,B000TLTCT0,"Although in most ways these are classy DVD presentations, I did encounter an exasperating technical problem when I got to the still photo/ad art galleries.  You're instructed to use the right skip/left skip buttons on your remote to move forward or backward through the images, but when I repeatedly pressed those buttons a slashed red O flashed on screen, indicating that I was requesting an impossible function!  On a hunch, I tried the same thing with the special features disc of Fox's ""Fly Collection""; same result!  (I should add that I e-mailed Fox Home Entertainment about all this, but - predictably - they didn't bother to respond.)  If anyone out there has found a way around this problem, let me know!",1199750400,8,713,4.867768595041323
2906699,5,B000TLTCT0,"In the 1930s, the relatively new field of horror cinema was dominated by Universal, with its often wonderful monster movies such as Dracula, Frankenstein and the Mummy.  As the Universal movies got campier in the 1940s, not many studios really filled the void.  Certainly, the best of 1940s horror came from Val Lewton's pictures for RKO (Cat People, The Leopard Man and others).  Fox, on the other hand, did not really have a reputation for horror in this era, as is obvious from the Fox Horror Classics set.  That's not to say that they are bad movies, just that I don't know if they are really horror.

Besides being Fox movies, the three movies in this set are also tied together by all being directed by John Brahm.  First made of these three - and the closest to being a horror movie - is also the weakest in the set:  The Undying Monster.  The story deals with the isolated Hammond family that is plagued by a curse that has a monster preying on the male Hammonds over the past few generations.  This is a pale imitation of two genres made famous by Universal:  the monster movie (particularly the Wolf Man) and the mystery movie (particularly the Sherlock Holmes movies, though Fox was actually the first to do the Rathbone movies).  The biggest failing of the movie is the fact that the monster is on screen too infrequently.

Much better is The Lodger, a remake of what was Alfred Hitchcock's first suspense movie.  Even if you've watched the older version, however, this one is still fun to watch and substantially different, plotwise.  Among the big names in the movie are Merle Oberon and George Sanders, but the star is Laird Cregar who plays the title character.  Sadly, Cregar's career was very short (less than a decade) because he steals the show in most of his movies (especially in I Wake Up Screaming, part of the Fox Film Noir series).  The movie itself deals with Cregar as Jack the Ripper, taking up residence in a rooming house where his fellow residents begin to suspect he may not be fully on the up-and-up.

Best of all is Hangover Square.  In a way, it is a reworking of The Lodger to capitalize on that movie's box office success, with Sanders and Cregar both returning in hero and villain roles respectively.  Actually, Cregar is not so much evil as sick, driven under stress to take on a second, homicidal personality; in his lucid moments, however, he is a good guy, a musician who falls for bad girl Linda Darnell, my favorite femme fatale from the 1940s (who, like Cregar, would die at a young age under tragic circumstances).  Besides Cregar and Darnell, there is also the great music of Bernard Herrmann that is an essential part of the movie.

The Lodger and Hangover Square fit more in the thriller or mystery category than horror, but that doesn't diminish their quality.  Overall, The Undying Monster merits a low three stars, The Lodger four and Hangover Square five.  Add to that some special features, most notably commentaries on the Cregar movies and some mini-documentaries on Cregar and Brahm, and this set merits a full five stars.  It may not really be a horror set, but Fox Horror Classics is a worthwhile collection of some generally obscure movies.",1198368000,34,3201,4.675

8210032,5,B000TLTCT0,I would have been happy with just The Undying Monster digitally remastered. It has been a family favorite for a long time. Why? Because it's all about the Hammond monster and we as the Hammond family thought it was terrific to have our very own monster. Having two movies of Laird Cregar who died right after making Hangover Square was a great bonus. Packaging was also very good and the enclosed pamphlet provided a thoughtful review of the three movies. Well done!,1520380800,,466,4.695121951219512

8210038,5,B000TLTCT0,"Terrific set of three films which, as a fan of the Universal monster movies, I bought for Undying Monster. While I enjoyed Undying it was the other two films that take this set to the must have level. Laird Cregar is simply awesome in both of these performances as a man on the brink of psychotic breakdown. In The Lodger, he may or may not be Jack the Ripper and the film does a great job of leaving this open ended without infuriating the viewer and technically also leaves open whether he lives or dies at the end. As great as he was in The Lodger, Hangover Square is a true acting tour de force. His combined size, facial expressions and delivery bring true menace to screen. I won't argue with others on here that say these aren't really true ""horror"" movies but there are at least three scenes in Hangover Square that are as genuinely frightening as anything delivered by Universal including the finale which you won't soon forget.",1500249600,,937,4.517647058823529

Great version of ""The Lodger"", very atmospheric and good direction from John Brahm (who directs all three movies)  ""Hangover Street"" is somewhat of a remake of ""The Lodger"" and is just as good.  ""The Undying Monster"" is the only true horror flick of the three and is a pretty good take on the werewolf theme.  These films remind me a lot of the great Val Lewton chillers of the same period.",1499644800,,440,4.4625
