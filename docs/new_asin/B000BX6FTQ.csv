8093810,5,B000BX6FTQ,"This movie has no songs ,no flashy dances ,no typical silly comedy neither over the top luck by main protagonist .It kind of sci-fi mixed with art movie about a scenario .What will happen if all girls are killed at birth just to keep male dominence in a village .This scenario can be applied to china right now as they have 2 to 1 ratio of adult males to females according to nytimes (google china male to female ratio).i'll not give out much but its very well portraited .A good cinema experience where you'll feel pain,sorrow and anger about the society and choices they make.

Highly Recommended",1321920000,5,598,4.588785046728972
