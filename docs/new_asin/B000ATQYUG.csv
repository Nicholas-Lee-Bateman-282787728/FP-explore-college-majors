2393698,1,B000ATQYUG,False advertising!!  These shorts have NOT been remastered.  The quality is poor and definately not up to Disney standards.  I am shocked at some of the seasoned reviewers on Amazon that gave this 5 stars without even addressing the quality issue.  Even worse is the reviewer who acknowledged that these shorts are not remastered but gave the collection 5 stars anyway.  Disappointing.  Don't let nostalgia cloud your decision to accept an inferior product.,1134950400,20,457,5.191780821917808
2393699,1,B000ATQYUG,"Doug Thomas DVD Editor, do you think offering the following: ""Hear our interview with Leonard Maltin: Listen in on Amazon.com DVD Managing Editor Doug Thomas's interview with Leonard Maltin on hosting the Walt Disney Treasures series, his movie guide, and more."" is a good idea considering how badly Disney dropped the ball with the remastering of the two animation releases in this series?

Just read the howls on your own customer reviews of these two items. I would hate to think Amazon is supporting such a poor quality product. Maltin apparently via e-mails in response to complaints sent to him has been backing away from taking responsibility for this, but I would think as the name behind this series he should stand up for consumers who use him for guidance on their purchases.

Since you do not offer any contact information Doug, I am using this forum to reach you.",1134777600,22,876,4.833333333333333
2393700,1,B000ATQYUG,"I pre-ordered this set trusting the Walt Disney Company to deliver the same level of quality as on the previous Walt Disney Treasures collections.  When I popped this DVD in and pressed play I sat and watched in horror as Disney threw my trust to the floor and violated it repeatedly.  While I knew the quality of the packaging had slipped on the last few sets, I really didn't care too much because the material on the DVDs themselves was remastered and pristine.  This time however the DVD content took several steps downward in an apparent attempt to match the declining quality of the packaging.  It is blatantly obvious that none of the shorts are remastered.  I don't hold Mr. Maltin at fault here, I'm sure it was some haughty executive money-grubber high up in the company that thought they could cut corners like this and we consumers would be too stupid to notice.  Next year there will be no pre-ordering of the WDT sets for me.  I'll wait for the reviews to roll in to make sure they've actually been remastered (and with no DVNR) before spending another dime on this series.  It is so sad to see a former high-water mark of the DVD industry fall down like this.",1134345600,38,1174,4.530805687203792
2393701,4,B000ATQYUG,"you'd know that she is missing!!  Every Disney ""Special"" cartoon (as per Leonard Maltin's Disney Films) has been included here except the excellent and charming ""Suzie, the Blue Coupe"".  How very disappointing.  Did they loose it?  What gives?  Suzie was one of the best cartoons of the 50's.  Like ""The Little House"", it is the heart-warming life story of one character's journey through good times and bad. I can't think of any reason not to include it.  Also, the sound on a couple of the shorts is distorted.  This is especially noticeable on ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"", of all things!

Should you buy it?  Of course!  No Disney fan can be without it.  Content-wise, it is one of the best and most entertaining sets in this series and deserves 5 stars were it not for the above mentioned atrocities.",1134172800,5,808,4.692857142857143
2393702,5,B000ATQYUG,"Disney has made a great decision (thanks to Leonard Maltin) to release some of their rarest films to the home market.

CHICKEN LITTLE gets a re-release here from the ""On The Front Lines"" DVD Tin. I don't mind the brief double dipping, but some shorts are missing!

Here is a list of MISSING 'rarities':

1952 SUZIE THE LITTLE BLUE COUPE (which is an extra on the Love Bug DVD)
1954 CASEY BATS AGAIN
1965 FREEWAY PHOBIA
1965 GOOFY'S FREEWAY TROUBLE (aka Freeway Phobia 2)
1967 SCROOGE McDUCK & MONEY
1969 IT'S TOUGH TO BE A BIRD
1978 SMALL ONE (which is on the Disney Holiday DVD)

Unfortunatley, for the first time in the DISNEY TREASURES DVD TIN history, Disney has chosen NOT TO RESTORE the images.  You will see all of the stains, splices, scratches & blemishes.  If this were any other DVD presentation, I would have been raving over the sharpness & clarity of the Alice Silent Comedies.  But this is the Treasures DVD Tin series that we have come to know and love for the painstaking restoration work given to the included films.

Even the color shorts of the 1940's & 1950's don't look as good as previous Disney Treasures DVD Tin releases.  True, Ferdinand The Bull looks nice for the first time on Home Video ( the VHS & Laserdisc releases of the past looked very yellow ) .  Outside of the Alice Comedies, the presentations don't look bad, they just don't hold up to the previous Disney Treasures DVD Tins.

Oh, and the Cinemascope Cartoons are NOT ANAMORPHIC and look grainy when blown up for wide-screen televisions!

I hope this is not a trend for this series, there are still Donald, Pluto & Silly Symphonies cartoons that have not yet been released!  Mr. Maltin has e-mailed me that while these DVD Tins are his project, the quality of the transfers is out of his control.  He does express hope that those responsible will take note of the complaints and not short-cut the next wave of DVD tins.",1133913600,13,1909,4.560117302052786
2393703,5,B000ATQYUG,"It's good to see Disney releasing a lot of its really rare cartoons out of the vault...While a few on this are not so rare, being available on other DVD,s most I haven't seen for years...Mr only hope that at some time in the future they will include a short cartoon that won an Academy Award in 1935 called ""Three Orphan Kittens""....I have not seen this released anywhere on video or DVD and the last time I actually saw this  was while watching ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" back in the 80's....so I hope that if they release another DVD of rarities that they will consider this little gem.",1127865600,5,593,4.440366972477064
2393704,5,B000ATQYUG,"Oh Boy!!! Disney's greatest ""Rarities"" on DVD. This will be a suprise  for Humphery the Bear fans considering how ""In the Bag""(another popular disney cartoon on ""The Encylopedia of DIsney Animated Shorts and for Disney cartoon fans in general) will be on this collection for the first time! well it is. But I am upset with this set as well as ""The Chronological Donald: Volume 2"" and that is because the Disney Company did such a lousy job on the restartation. DISNEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR FANS ANYMORE OR DO YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE ONES! Furthermore, if Walt Disney himself was alive today what would he think?

I hope more people found this review hepful!",1125187200,6,689,4.639344262295082
2393705,5,B000ATQYUG,"Exact information on the contents of this DVD set has not yet been released. The shorts ""Lambert, the Sheepish Lion"", ""Ben and Me"", and ""Freewayphobia 1 & 2"" are only EXPECTED to be on the set - but not official yet.

This set has been described in various websites as mainly containing Disney's ""one-shot"" cartoons. Disney called these one-shots ""Specials"", which generally replaced the earlier Silly Symphony cartoons. Generally, these cartoons did not star the regular Disney cartoon characters, such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy, etc.

The original silent Alice Comedies cartoons never interested me personally. I never found them that entertaining. However, they are interesting historically in seeing what Walt's animators did before Mickey Mouse. The Alice shorts on this DVD will probably be taken from the selection that was shown on the Disney Channel a few years ago.

The following are the Specials shorts from the 1930s through the 1960s. There have been several wonderful Specials from the 1970s to the present, but hopefully they will see DVD release in future Treasures sets.

1938

Ferdinand The Bull - A huge, but peaceful, bull only wants to sit quietly under his tree and sniff the flowers. He is carted away to the bull ring when he is mistaken for a ferocious bull. He disappoints the crowd when he just sits and smells a flower bouquet and refuses to fight. Ferdinand is returned home, where he happily returns to his peaceful life. A marvelous cartoon with excellent animation, based on a wonderful children's book.

1943

Education For Death - This wartime short was a propaganda short about the making of a German child into a Nazi soldier. Since this short was on the On The Front Lines DVD set, I would be surprised to see it on this Disney Rarities DVD set.

Reason And Emotion - This wartime short was a propaganda short about letting reason keep emotions under control and dealing with wartime rumors. This short was also on the On The Front Lines DVD set, so I would be surprised to see it on this Disney Rarities DVD set.

Chicken Little - Foxey Loxey convinces Chicken Little and the rest of the farmyard poulty that the sky is falling. Everyone rushes to the ""safety"" of the fox's cave, where they are definitely not safe. Although this short was on the On The Front Lines DVD set, it is an entertaining short and may be on the Disney Rarities DVD set.

1944

The Pelican and the Snipe - Sterling Holloway (voice of numerous Disney characters, especially Winnie The Pooh) narrates how Vidi, the snipe, spends his nights keeping his ""sleep-flying"" friend Monte, the pelican, safe from harm where they live - on top of a lighthouse near Montevideo, Uruguay.

1950

The Brave Engineer - Casey Jones is determined to get his train to the station on time, in spite of numerous midadventures - including a flood, train robbers, and a head-on collision with another train.

Morris, The Midget Moose - Morris is laughed at and scorned by the whole moose herd because he is so small, although he has a full-sized set of antlers. He meets another outcast moose, Balsam, who is huge but has a puny set of antlers. The two team up together to become the leaders of the herd.

1952

Lambert, The Sheepish Lion - A stork (voiced by Sterling Holloway) delivers a lion cub to a flock of sheep by mistake. Lambert is bullied by the other lambs because he's different and mild, but grows up to realize his power as a lion and defends the flock from a wolf. Nominated for an Academy Award.

Susie, The Little Blue Coupe - Susie is bought by a man who takes good care of her. But, years later, her owner trades her in due to needed expensive repairs. Her life as a used car is miserable, with an uncaring owner and a series of unhappy experiences. She is wrecked and abandoned in a junkyard. An eager teenaged boy buys her and converts her into a hot rod - she is ""like new"" again and is happy with her new owner.

The Little House - The little house begins life happily in the country but ""progress"" soon surrounds it with the big city buildings. A caring family has it moved back into the country and the little house is happy once more. Based on a popular children's book.

1953

Adventures In Music: Melody (also known as just ""Melody"") - Professor Owl teaches his class about music melody.

Football Now and Then - A boy and his grandfather argue about which football team would win - while watching a team from the early days of football play a modern team on television.

Ben and Me - Amos, a poor little church mouse, comes to live with Ben Franklin. With the help of Amos' suggestions, Ben invents the Franklin Stove and bifocals, discovers electricity, and inspires the opening words of the Declaration of Independence. I have always loved this short - it is VERY SPECIAL INDEED!!! Narrated by Sterling Holloway, it was nominated for an Oscar.

Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom - Professor Owl illustrates the development of musical instruments from caveman days to modern times. This short won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon. It was the first cartoon filmed in CinemaScope.

1954

Pigs Is Pigs - Flannery is a train station master, who goes strictly by the book. When he disagrees with a customer about whether guinea pigs are pets or livestock (like real pigs), he telegrams the main office and awaits their decision on the dispute. In the meantime, the guinea pigs are reproducing so quickly that the station is overrun with guinea pigs. This is one of my favorites of all cartoons, not just Disney cartoons. It is hilariously funny and very inventive. The story is told in a very creative rhyming sing-song fashion. It was nominated for an Academy Award. It was based on a 1905 book by Ellis Parker Butler.

Casey Bats Again - Casey is dismayed that he has only daughters, since he wants sons to follow in his footsteps as baseball players. Eventually, his nine daughters grow up to become a female baseball team, which wins the championship despite his interference.

Social Lion - A lion, feared by all in the wilds of Africa, learns that no one fears him after he is captured and then escapes in the big city. No one recognizes that he is a lion until a saleman dresses him up as a human. Then everyone sees that he is a lion and are terrified. The lion ends up in the zoo, scaring all the zoo visitors. This is a very funny, silly cartoon.

1956

Hooked Bear - Humphrey the Bear clashes with Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore when Humphrey tries to fish like the humans and the ranger tells him to fish like a bear. Humphrey continually fails in his efforts to fish until the fishing season ends and Humphrey has to run for his life when hunting season begins. There are numerous funny scenes in this cartoon. I have always loved the cartoons that Humphrey appeared in. Except for one other cartoon, most of the cartoons count as Donald Duck cartoons and should appear in the later Chronological Donald Duck Treasures set when it gets to the years 1953 through 1955.

Jack and Old Mac - This experimental cartoon tells two different stories, with two jazz sequences and limited animation. The nursery rhyme ""This Is The House That Jack Built"" has the characters animated as the shape of the names - for example: the dog is made by the letters d, o, g. Old MacDonald plays the piano while the farmyard animals, playing different instruments, jive to a jam session in an updated vrsion of Old MacDonald Had A Band, instead of ""A Farm"". I love this short for its uniqueness and weirdness. The short is fun and fascinating to me.

In The Bag - After the tourists have left trash everywhere in the park as the visiting season eands, Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore creates a fake game to trick the park bears to clean up the mess. Poor Humphrey the Bear is stuck with cleaning the entire mess and continually has bad luck trying to get rid of the trash. The cartoon contains a very catchy ""In The Bag"" song, part of which goes ""pick up the paper, put it in the bag, bump, bump"" with the bears bumping each others bottoms as they dance. This is a very funny cartoon that also succeeds in making you sorry for Humphrey because he is unfairly stuck with trying to clean up all the trash.

A Cowboy Needs A Horse - A little boy dreams of such western adventures as battling Indians, capturing a bandit, and rescuing a fair damsel. The song ""A Cowboy Needs A Horse"" is a very catchy tune.

1957

The Story Of Anyburg, U.S.A. - Automobiles are put on trial for breaking traffic laws, but are declared ""not guilty"" - since it is the people who drive them who must admit their guilt and promise to drive safely.

The Truth About Mother Goose - The historical background behind the stories is told of three popular nursery rhymes - Little Jack Horner; Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary; and London Bridge. A very entertaining short with ingenious gags, nice background art, and a catchy jazz score. Nominated for an Academy Award.

1958

Paul Bunyan - The folk tale of the gigantic Paul Bunyan is told from when he was a baby to adult times. I enjoy the drama and the humor in the short, with animation in a simple, clear style.

1959

Eyes In Outer Space - The future of satellites' ability to forecast and control the weather is explored. While mainly educational in nature, there is some nice animation and a fun section about how ""folk sayings"" predicted the weather. Various reference books differ on whether this is considered a ""Special"" short, so it may not be included in this DVD set.

Noah's Ark - The biblical story of Noah and his ark is told, with the use stop-motion animation. This short used variety store items (pipe cleaners, thimbles, thread spools, etc.) to build the humans and animals - resulting in a very unusual look to the characters. It was nomiated for an Academy Award.

1960

Goliath II - Goliath II is a child elephant who is only 5 inches tall, to the shame of his father Goliath, a giant among elephants. Goliath II deals with several problems due to his size and the herd continually has to save him and avoid stepping on him. He finally becomes a hero to the herd by battling and defeating a mouse. This is one of my favorite cartoons. At about twice the length of a regular cartoon, this short has the time for both drama and humor - giving you time to care for Goliath II and his troubles. It was nominated for an Academy Award.

1961

The Saga Of Windwagon Smith - Captain Smith has rigged a Conestoga prairie wagon with sails and tiller like a ship and sails into a small western town and falls in love with the mayor's daughter Molly. The townspeople see this new type of wagon as a way to get rich hauling large volumes of freight by building a huge, super windwagon - only to see a tornado carry the wagon off with the captain and Molly aboard. An interesting cartoon with some funny scenes.

1962

A Symposium On Popular Songs - Ludwig Von Drake lectures all about popular music, introducing several songs illustrated with stop-motion animation using paper cut-outs and household items. It was nominated for an Academy Award and has several fun and interesting scenes.

1967

Scrooge McDuck and Money - Scrooge lectures his nephews on the history of money, and how to budget and invest wisely.

While mainly an educational cartoon, it is very entertaining. The short combines live-action with animation.

1969

It's Tough To Be A Bird - The birds' never-ending fight for survival is humorously told, especially the struggle between birds and man. This is one of my favorites of the Specials shorts. It includes a hilarious song by Ruth Buzzi ""When The Buzzards Return To Hinckley Ridge"". It also includes some cutting-edge very non-Disney type humor in modern avant-garde animation styles. It won the Academy Award as Best Short Subject.

That covers the Specials, which have been said to be the contents on this DVD set. The two Goofy Freewayphobia shorts might also be included, although they are not technically Specials. The classic 1959 educational Donald Duck short on mathematics ""Donald In Mathmagic Land"" has also been strongly rumored to be included in this DVD set.

If all (or most) of the above is indeed included in this Disney Rarities DVD set, it will be a very special DVD collection and among the best DVD bargains of all time. I personally anticipate having this DVD set more than the other three Treasures sets being released at the same time.",1124582400,101,12405,4.632922936616507
2393706,5,B000ATQYUG,"This collection is including some of the original ""Alice"" shorts that Walt Disney began with back in the 1920s, a format that entailed using a live little girl (albeit very sophisticated with heavy make-up!) against animated backgrounds, and some of the very best Disney shorts ever to come out of the studio during the Golden Era, when the ""9 Old Men"", original animators, were still creating their unique magic with pen and paper. The shorts include: ""Lambert, the Sheepish Lion"", ""Ben and Me"", and ""Freewayphobia"" Parts 1 and 2.

For those of you who have not had the pleasure of seeing ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"", you are in for a real treat; the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, was so enchanted with this particular short, that Walt Disney presented him with his own film version, an original print.

It tells the story of a timid lion who is adopted by a sheep, and thinks he is one of them, until the day his mother is threatened by a wolf, then he becomes the lion he was meant to be all along. GREAT short.

""Ben and Me"" tells the story of Amos Mouse, who lives with his family in a church, and explains, ""We were as poor as...church mice.""

Setting out to make his way in the world and find a fortune to help out his family, Amos eventually ends up in the home of Benjamin Franklin, and the two form a very funny and touching partnership. Amos explains, throughout the short, that some of Franklin's inventions were actually his...bifocals, the Franklin stove, and the printing press, saving Franklin's credit in the process.

Thrilled with his tiny new partner, who is willing to work for a crumb of cheese and sleeps on a feather, Franklin next involves Amos in his research with electricity...and thereby ends the partnership when Amos, in his tiny box aboard the kite, suffers a direct hit from a bolt of lightning and gets his tail fried.

Franklin hurries over to his kite and the furious mouse and asks ""Was it electricity?"" To which Amos responds: ""WAS IT ELECTRICITY???? WAS IT ELECTRICITY?"" And stalks off into the night and it is many years before Franklin can once again coax his friend back to work. This time Amos helps Franklin give Jefferson the opening words to the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States, and it is very impressive and great to see. The animation on this short is extraordinary, rich in color and detail, as were most shorts from that time.

Freewayphobia Parts 1 and 2 are some of the very best Goofy educational shorts ever made, and they are fascinating to watch, while at the same time, educating drivers of all ages...

We see what happens when Goofy drives after having too much to drink, does not check his gas tank, does not check his car to make sure it is ready for a long drive on the highway, gets distracted and stops watching the road ahead of him and comes to a sudden stop without signaling, makes fast lane changes, also without signaling, and drives with an unsecured load...great info imparted in a wonderful way, with Goofy and the wonderful animation fo the time.

A must for all Disney fans...",1124236800,26,3067,4.623161764705882

Well Disney thought we were fools, but it's too late now because this was released like in 2005 or 2006. Most of the contents on these two discs are not remastered, as you can see; without a doubt, the quality is like 400p in video resolution. Right between 360 and 480p like the youtube quality. They also didn't remaster Donald Duck Volume Two which is a tremendous disappointment.

2393776,4,B000ATQYUG,"The second release of Wave 5 is or should I say should have been a very special release. Like the past few Treasures sets, this one suffers from lack of restoration and care on some of the shorts. Don't get me wrong everything here is is good shape, but lack the wow factor that we've grown accustomed to in the Treasures line.

The funny thing is the oldest stuff on this set (Alice's Wonderland), looks extremely good considering they were made in the 20's. Most of the other shorts range from good to excellent, but too may times they look a little soft or slightly washed out. Nothing looks so bad that I would call them total trash, but it's obvious that they could have looked a lot better. It's as if they said ""They look pretty good...just leave them that way!""

On the plus side this is a really great collection of Walt's lesser known works, but I was amazed at how many of these shorts I remembered, but had been long forgotten. The shorts range anywhere from 6 to 21 minutes and are much more diverse than past collections featuring one character.

Disc one features 18 shorts including the 7 Alice's Wonderland that have survived the past 80 years. Five of the seven look very good with two shorts looking a bit tattered. It's a great addition of these shorts regardless as I found them to be entertaining and interesting. The rest of the shorts on disc one are of varying quality too. It's a shame that the care wasn't taken to make these shorts jump off the screen, but they are all acceptable. Ben & Me appears to be edited for ""PC"" reasons?, but I'm not all that familar with that cartoon. The extras on these sets are getting a little thin too, but what is here is appropriate for the collection.

Disc two includes 13 shorts, but being that some are rather long, I don't feel short changed. Overall this is a set I wouldn't pass up if you're a fan of Disney animation, but it would have been great if more care was given to the shorts. The rare collection of true rarities certainly makes up for the sets shortcomings.",1378339200,5,2037,4.424

2393787,5,B000ATQYUG,"After struggling with packaging issues (the new product from Amazon.com came in already scratched and dented) I was delighted with the shorts overall. Many were prime examples of quality Disney animation, which was most of my reason for buying the product. However, any fan of Disney Animation will be disappointed with the cartoons ""Noah's Ark"" and ""A Symposium on Popular Songs"". Both rely heavily on a primitive, abstract form of stop-motion animation that looks like a haphazard arts and crafts project. Personally, this is not my ""thing"" and was surprised (but not pleasantly) with shorts of this nature on the Disc. However, putting those two aside the rest were wonderful examples of Disney animation and storytelling that many will never witness due to their being ""Rarities"". Almost all of these shorts are right up there with the best of Mickey Mouse. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in old cartoons!

As mentioned in some other reviews, yes, the quality of the actual video is not always at it's greatest, and many degrade the Walt Disney Company for not remastering the shorts. However, the perfectionist and Historian in me loves them for what they are because they were not tampered by modern hands. Whether it's done in the name of ""restoring"" or not, when something is remastered it is no longer in it's original form. I am ready and assuming that all discs are in their original form as presented to theatres when released for the very first time, and I love them for that! If you enjoy seeing things how they are and not untampered, you will find an extra appreciation for every short in the set.",1335312000,,1626,4.870036101083032

2393813,4,B000ATQYUG,"The second release of Wave 5 is or should I say should have been a very special release. Like the past few Treasures sets, this one suffers from lack of restoration and care on some of the shorts.  Don't get me wrong everything here is is good shape, but lack the wow factor that we've grown accustomed to in the Treasures line.

The funny thing is the oldest stuff on this set (Alice's Wonderland), looks  extremely good considering they were made in the 20's. Most of the other shorts range from good to excellent, but too may time they look a little soft or slightly washed out. Nothing looks so bad that I would call them total trash, but it's obvious that they could have looked a lot better. It's as if they said ""They look pretty good...just leave them that way!""

On the plus side this is a really great collection of Walt's lesser known works, but I was amazed at how many of these shorts I remembered, but had been long forgotten. The shorts range anywhere from 6 to 21 minutes and are much more diverse than past collections featuring one character.

Disc one features 18 shorts including the 7 Alice's Wonderland that have survived the past 80 years. Five of the seven look very good with two shorts looking a bit tattered. It's a great addition of these shorts regardless as I found them to be entertaining and interesting. The rest of the shorts on disc one are of varying quality too. It's a shame that the care wasn't taken to make this shorts jump off the screen, but they are all acceptable. The extras on these sets are getting a little thin too, but what is here is appropriate for the collection.

Disc two includes 13 shorts, but being that some are rather long, I don't feel short changed. Overall this is a set I wouldn't pass up if you're a fan of Disney animation, but it would have been great if more care was given to the shorts. The rare collection of true rarities certainly makes up for the sets shortcomings.",1291161600,4,1940,4.435393258426966

2393817,5,B000ATQYUG,"A fascinating cross-section of Walt Disney's animated shorts from the 1920s through the 1960s, this Disney Treasures tin will fill a lot of empty spots for the hardcore Disney collector.

Perhaps most importantly, we get several installments from the silent ""Alice Comedies"" series.  Over fifty shorts were produced between the years 1923-27, showcasing a live little girl in an animated wonderland.  Several girls played Alice during the run of the series, the first and most famous being Virginia Davis--who has the unique honor of being Disney's very first star, pre-dating even one Mickey Mouse!  Davis' most beloved episode (""Alice's Wild West Show"") is included in this set.

My favourite shorts include ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"" and ""The Little House"" (modeled after the art of Mary Blair) , both warmly narrated by Sterling Holloway.  ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom!"" has the distinction of being the first Disney short to be filmed in CinemaScope and stereophonic sound--it also picked up an Academy Award in 1953.  ""Ferdinand the Bull"" (an Oscar winner in 1938) is another valuable addition to this set.  ""The Truth About Mother Goose"", one of Disney's unusually dark musical shorts, also makes an appearance; along with the riotous comedy gem ""Pigs is Pigs"", the story of a railroad station-master who inherits an ever-growing family of guinea pigs.

In the extras, Leonard Maltin shares an insightful interview with Virginia Davis (now sadly no longer with us), and also details Disney's early career in the featurette ""From Kansas to Hollywood"".  Songwriter Richard Sherman provides an audio commentary for one of his favourite shorts, 1962's ""A Symposium on Popular Songs"" on Disc 2.

If you're building a library of Disney's cartoon classics, this Treasures Tin is a must own--if only for the super-rare Alice shorts (which really deserve their own tin release).  A delightful, timeless slice of magical entertainment for the entire family!",1251676800,5,1957,5.27741935483871

You just don't see many representations of these anymore. While some people would be offended by a couple of the cartoons that have racial stereotypes not acceptable in today's society, I think it's great to have a record of where we've been as a culture. It opens up opportunities for dialogue about it. I talk about it wirh my 4-year-old. I'm really glad I bought it!",1245456000,2,683,4.60655737704918

2393854,5,B000ATQYUG,"If you watched the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" (or any of its variants) on television during the Baby-boom-gen x years or are old enough to remember the pre-VCR and DVD years when it was a special event to bring a movie projector to your church, school, or community centers to see some good cartoons and kid movies, then you already know most of this stuff even if the titles don't ring a bell.

First off, the Alice Comedies. These are known mostly to the most hardcore fans of Uncle Walt. While most cartoons from the silent era were woefully flat and unfunny, Uncle Walt and co. were in a class by themselves with high-quality funny stuff. The Alice toons predate the mouse formerly known as Mortimer by several years and featured the adventures of a real girl named Alice and her adventures in a cartoon world with her buddy Julius the cat. A couple of films, ""Alice's Wild West Adventure"" and ""Alice gets in Dutch"" feature an Our Gang copy of live action friends in the mix.

Two mostly animated episodes, ""Alice's Egg Plant"" and ""Alice's Mysterious Mystery"" are real knee-slappers. In the former, a Communist rooster named ""Little Red Henski"" does some barnyard rabble-rousing, agitating the chickens to go on strike! In the latter, dogcatchers wearing Ku Klux Klan outfits kidnap the pooches for a sausage factory. Both are as bizzare as they sound!

""Ferdinand the Bull"" is a thinly disguised antiwar tale about a bull who refuses to fight that was said to be hated by Hitler and loved by Gandhi.
The version of ""Chicken Little"" (1943) is like none-other. Here, Foxy Loxy uses a psychology book to propagandize and mislead the chickens to his lair. Children (like myself when I saw this at age 12) will be amused and the implications of the theme of thought control will go over their heads. But adults will find the surprise ending a tad unsettling, if thought provoking. See it and you'll understand.

""Casey Jones,"" featuring the voice of forgotten radio comedian Jerry Colona is another belly-laugh inducer. As we did when we saw this at a local community center when I was a kid, expect the children to yell ""EGAAAAD!"" every few seconds after watching this. The same is true of the title song from the wonderfully hilarious IN THE BAG, a staple on the old ""Wonderful World of Disney."" Here, the ranger tries to trick the bears into cleaning up the park by singing,""Pick pick it up, put it in the bag, bump bump."" The small frys will not stop doing this after they see this delightfully catchy song and dance.

""Paul Bunyan"" and ""Ben (Franklin) and Me"" are delightful Disney detours into American folklore and history. ""Goliath II,"" about a midget elephant, is a variation on the ""Ugly Duckling"" theme. But Ludwing Von Drake's ""Symposioum on Popular Music"" has some wild moments. The PC thought police will have fits over the (admittely offensive) Asian stereotype in the Andrews Sisters' parody and this segment would be censored if aired today, but the ending where Ludwig rocks out on guitar and spins on his head will have you rolling on the floor!

This collection is a MUST for lovers of GREAT cartoons! Uncle Walt rules, (excuse me, I mean ""ruled"") and so does this collection!",1188604800,6,3197,4.741007194244604

2393856,5,B000ATQYUG,"As an early childhood professional, I consider this set appropriate for primary schoolers.  Having grown up on these cartoons, I see them as high quality entertainment and invaluable as souvenirs.

I've never seen any of Disney's Alice shorts, so their presence alone raises this set's value.  Disc 1 contains numerous cartoons that were never part of any Disney series.  Many of these cartoons are mistakenly categorized as Silly Symphonies.  ""Ferdinand the Bull"", ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"", ""The Little House"", and ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk, Boom"" are some of the most beautiful, celebrated cartoons that the studio ever made.  The other cartoons define the word rarity because few have seen them.

Disc 2 continues highlighting the more obscure cartoons like ""The Saga of Windwagon Smith"", ""The Story of Anytown, USA"", and ""A Symposium of Popular Songs"".  The most well-known cartoons on this disc are ""Goliath II"", ""Pigs is Pigs"" and ""Paul Bunyan.""

2393907,4,B000ATQYUG,"Disney Treasures- Disney Rarities- Celebrated Shorts (1920s-1960s) is a wonderful collection of cartoons that are not easy to find (which is probably why it is titled as such). Some of the earliest works, like the Alice Comedies, may only appeal to the nostalgic and fans of animation as an art form. Later works are still entertaining. In all honesty, though, only you know if you have outgrown cartoons or not. Some of us have and some of us never will.

  If you need something for little kids to watch, this is a lengthy set of great choices. Do not wait too long to decide to buy. A limited number of copies were made. When those sell out, this collection goes into the Disney Vault where it might not be released again. But some of these shorts may pop up elsewhere. For example the shorts ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom"" and ""Melody"" were both on the Fantasia 2000 DVD (which is currently in the vault) as extras but managed to make their way to this collection a few years later. There also seems to be a trend of people selling DVDs from the Disney Treasures series at a much higher price once stores run out. The point here is that if you do not get it now, you might have to pay more for it later or wait for it to come out on some other format.

HOWEVER, I still have to give these two DVD's five stars; but I do it from the standpoint of a mother reviewing this collection for other caregivers of younger children.  [Mine are boy and girl; 4 and 6 respectively.]

This DVD provides hours of good entertainment.  It also serves to give children a historical prospective to animation.  They can see from the Alice series where the industry began.  Then they can watch it evolve to brilliant color and wonderful stories like Windwagon Smith and Paul Bunyan.

And no, at a young age, children probably won't understand the significance of the influence of WWII on animation, or life in the U.S. and elsewhere, but it can lay the groundwork for such a time line.  It also links them with their grandparents.  I don't know about other folks, but now my six y.o. can talk to her grandfather and grandmother about Ferdinand the Bull and Chick Little since they are all movie shorts they have all watched.

Five Stars.  The quality of the 're-mastering' is in question, but the entertainment value is not.",1165363200,6,1194,4.742718446601942
2393910,5,B000ATQYUG,"When Walt Disney was just starting out he worked for an advertising agency in Kansas City drawing theatrical cartoon ads and experimented with stop-action animation in his spare time. His first animation venture ""Laugh-O-Grams"" was unsuccessful but its last gasp before going out of business was an unfinished one-reel (12 minute) cartoon called ""Alice's Wonderland"".

Max and Dave Fleischer had already introduced a cartoon series called ""Out of the Inkwell"" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt borrowed this idea for the first segments of ""Alice's Wonderland"" and for the later segments he reversed it and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Virginia's mother let them shoot the live scenes in her house with Virginia's aunt playing Alice's mother.

The film begins with little Alice visiting an animation studio, where Walt and Ub Iwerks are working. They show her some scenes on their drawing boards and these turn into moving cartoons, which interact with live things in the studio. The best is a cartoon mouse (imagine that) poking a live cat until it moves. Although everything was silent in 1923 some music was later added to the production.

Back home from her day at the studio, the sleeping Alice dreams of taking a train to cartoon-land. She appears in live action superimposed on a cartoon background and interacts with a variety of cartoon animals. Finally, she jumps off a cliff and after falling for a while wakes up in her own bed.

Walt ran out of money before ""Alice's Wonderland"" could be finished and his company was disbanded. He moved out to Los Angeles and eventually sent what had been completed to an independent cartoon distributor in New York who contracted for a series of Alice cartoons.

Virginia Davis joined Walt in California and they began cranking out the series. Eventually there would be 56 Alice cartoons although Virginia was eventually replaced over a pay dispute.

""Alice's Wonderland"" was probably never really completed. It appears that at some point they reassembled it to provide an ending (basically just a repeat of an earlier scene in a different context). It is also likely that the falling scene was originally intended for a rabbit hole entrance to Wonderland at the start of the dream sequence, but was moved to the end to substitute for the unfinished portion.

 ""Alice Gets in Dutch"" is another early example of the series but Disney had already figured out the basic economies of the cartoon business. It was far cheaper in those days to film live action than to draw the 12 frames per second  needed for good animation, and the first half of ""Alice Gets in Dutch"" is live action. Of course the reverse is true today as computer animation is now cheaper than filming live action (""Ultraviolent"" is actually a return to the silent film days where Fleischer's live characters interact with animation).

The short begins with Alice in a classroom where she is blamed when an exploding balloon covers her teacher's face in ink. Alice is banished to a stool in the corner and given a Dunce Cap (when is the last time you saw one of those). She falls asleep and dreams she is outside the schoolhouse dancing with a bunch of cartoon animals. A cartoon version of her teacher (with devil's horns) comes outside the break up the fun. Trailing behind as her assistants are three animated books; labeled reading-writing-arithmetic.

The two sides shoot cannons at each other with inconclusive results until a cayenne pepper charge cause the books to sneeze until they are just piles of pages. But the next charge backfires and Alice and her pals begin to sneeze.

Although crudely drawn the animations do convey a bit of personality and Virginia Davis does a great job with her part. These silent cartoons are surprisingly entertaining. More importantly, Alice qualifies as Disney's first enduring character and the Alice series was his first successful venture.

By the time of ""Alice's Mysterious Mystery"", Margie Gay had replaced Virginia. To disguise this charge, Disney eliminated tight shots of the live character and went entirely with wide shots. The economics of the animation business had begun to dictate quality and quantity; meaning the stories were cut to one reel (six minutes) and the animation far less elaborate. In spite of this the characters in ""Alice's Mysterious Mystery"" still convey some personality.

""Alice's Mysterious Mystery"" is about as bizarre a story as you are likely to find. A mouse (not Mickey) and a bear supply a sausage factory with dog meat; first they pose as dogcatchers and capture a schoolhouse of puppies, then an attractive female dog lures male dogs to the factory window where the cat and bear open a trapdoor which whisks them into the basement. A helper down there hits them with a mallet and deposits them in cells. Then he takes them into a killing room and presumably stuffs them into sausage skins (I'm not joking this really happens).

Adding to the surreal quality of the thing are the Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes worn by the bear, mouse, and the basement henchman. Alice and Julius the Cat eventually save the day but not for those who have already been made into sausage.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1156204800,3,5352,4.935483870967742
2393911,5,B000ATQYUG,"I enjoyed many of these classics from childhood on ""the wonderful world of disney"". But that is not the only reason for collecting this DVD.

Walt Disney left an amazing legacy with his innovations which have paved the way to where Animation is today. On this disc are many styles of animation (cut-out animation, limited animation, and more).

Personally the ""Alice"" series on this disc (other than for historical reference) was not my favoriate. However this was the way animations were done in teh late 20's as the Animation industry was in its infancy. Even though the ""alice"" shorts were not as entertaining, the other animated shorts make up for it.

If you have ever studied Walt Disney there are many referemces to his short ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"". The pictures in those books don't do justice to the actual film on this disc.

The ""Chicken Little"" short was one that was my least favoriate. Watching it doesn't really have all the disney-style gags and is best discribed as a Warner Brothers quality.

My favoriate is ""A Symposium on Popular Songs"" with your host ""von drake"" One of the best characters Disney created (goofy professor with a unique way of mixing up words. I love his dialogue).

Everyone knows Disney told excellent stories yet lets talk about image quality: I love how this video has not been ""remastered"" and tweaked to look like modern day animation. The animations on this disc are all in color (with exceptions to ""alice"" shorts which were in B&W). But don't be fooled by those that claim this video needs remastering. While watching EVERY show on this disc I never noticed ""scratched-film"" lines or deteriorated video. these videos are crisp, unscratched, unmarked and a pure joy to watch. Even the audio is CLEAN, CLEAR and easily understandable!

About Technologies:

Technology was different in the 1960's compared to our HiDef 16:9 dolby digital 5.1 surround-sound home theatres many of us have. While watching these shows, expect sound from both left and right speakers and a picture of 4:3 aspect ratio video (that is traditional TV withouth HiDef, Widescreen).

If I had the chance to review the animations on this disc before I purchased it I know that there would not be any doubt in my discisions to buy it.",1155513600,4,2258,4.859375
2393932,5,B000ATQYUG,"""Lambert the Sheepish Lion,"" ""Paul Bunyan,"" ""The Little House""...all of the cartoons I loved when I was little, and now I can finally watch them again!  I used to see these shorts all the time on the Disney Channel (before they forgot what ""quality"" was and started churning out their vapid teeny bopper sitcoms), and I was really disappointed that they were no longer shown.

I would have preferred something without all of the Alice shorts on it--they never appealed to me.  However, there are plenty of others on the 2-DVD set that are fun to watch.  The quality is just fine...Really, if you're looking to see all the old Disney classic shorts again, then I would recommend this product!  There's not much more that can be said about it!",1151798400,7,741,4.6692307692307695
2393933,4,B000ATQYUG,"While Disney is famous for his animated movies and series starring such staples as Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck, he also produced a lot of one-time cartoons over the years.  This set in the Disney Treasures series collects many of them.

Disc one actually opens with the shorts I most wanted to see from the set, the Alice shorts.  These were Disney's first series of cartoons, produced in the twenties.  They starred a real life girl who had all kinds of adventures in a cartoon world.  While he did this more famously in Mary Poppins, these first attempts at the mixing live action and animation are quite fun and Disney fans will love getting to see them for the historical value.  The effects are decent for the time, but obviously laughable by today's standards.  We only get seven of the Alice shorts here, but they are enough to give us a feel for the series.  The early ones feature Alice in the real world and Cartoonland, while the later ones begin to focus more and more on the cartoons, leaving the real world (and at times Alice) out of the picture.

Disc one then proceeds to give us eleven more shorts, taking us to 1953.  Highlights include Oscar winner ""Ferdinand the Bull"" about the bull who doesn't want to fight in the arena, ""Chicken Little,"" a World War II retelling of the fable that starts off funny but ends with a serious lesson about listening to gossip, we watch ""The Brave Engineer"" do everything he can to keep his train on schedule, and football practices of years gone by are compared to contemporary strategies in ""Football Now and Then."" Closing out this disc is ""Ben and Me,"" Disney's retelling of Robert Lawson's fun tale on the real wisdom behind Benjamin Franklin's success, his mouse Amos.

Disc two picks up in 1954 and contains thirteen shorts that take us all the way to 1962.  It opens with the hilarious ""Pigs is Pigs"" that shows what can happen when bureaucracy gets out of hand.  Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore and Humphrey the Bear are featured in ""Hooked Bear"" and ""In the Bag,"" a couple shorts about life in a national park that remind me of Yogi Bear (one of his creators worked on these characters). Cars are put on trial for lousy driving in ""The Story of Anyburg, USA.""  And some of these shorts begin to get experimental.  ""Noah's Ark"" features stop motion animation and animals made out of everyday objects to retell the Bible story.  ""A Symposium on Popular Songs"" features stop motion animation of various styles to accompany the collection of song styles from the century.

And fans of children's picture book author Bill Peet - take note.  During his years working for Disney, Mr. Peet often turned his story ideas into shorts.  Three of them are collected here, ""Morris, the Midget Moose"" tells the story of Morris as he tries to overcome his ant size to fit in with the heard.  ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"" is about a lion that is accidentally left with a bunch of sheep by the stork.  Finally, ""Goliath II"" is about a 5-inch tall elephant trying to live up to his father's expectations.  Any fan of Bill Peet's books will recognize the themes used for these shorts.  They are entertaining for all, but especially for those familiar with his books.

The problem with the set comes with some of the more musical shorts.  To be brief, they aren't entertaining.  Disc one includes two Adventures in Music.  ""Melody"" and ""Toot, Whisle, Plunk and Boom"" are ok, but certainly not worth watching more then once.  Even ""The Truth About Mother Goose,"" which explains the stories behind such nursery rhymes as ""Little Jack Horner"" and ""London Bridge is Falling Down"" isn't especially entertaining.  They are more teaching then entertainment, and come across as such.  My other complaint is milder.  The shorts range from seven or either minutes to over twenty minutes each.  With that wide a range, it's hard to plan how many you can watch if you just want to sit down for a few minutes.

The bonus features are interesting as always.  Leonard Maltin gets the fun job of introducing each disc.  Unlike other collections, he doesn't pop up to give the PC spin on any of the shorts here.  He does get to interview Virginia Davis, however.  It was fascinating hearing the original Alice talk about her time working for Disney and how she almost got the job of Snow White.  Disc two features art galleries and an audio commentary on ""Symposium of Popular Songs"" by Richard Sherman, one of the composers.  The commentary really helped put the short in context and helped me appreciate it more.

While all the shorts don't live up to their potential, there are still plenty of entertaining shorts here to make it a worthwhile purchase for Disney fans.",1148947200,18,4690,4.678876678876679
2393934,3,B000ATQYUG,"It's not exactly a state secret that the ""Disney Treasures"" DVDs have been big money-makers for the company.  So how do you squeeze a little extra cash out of a cash cow?  Why, start throwing animated shorts onto DVD without remastering them, that's how!

Yep, the bulk of these cartoons are presented in vintage 20-year-old transfers.  The images are soft and low-res, colors are frequently washed-out (I defy you to find the color tan anywhere in ""Paul Bunyan""), and Cinemascope films such as ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"" are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen.  If you have a 16X9 TV, prepare yourself for a joyless experience.

The shorts themselves are largely second-tier Disney, with a few bona fide masterpieces such as ""Ferdinand the Bull."" Others show that when the Disney artists tackled a new field (such as UPA-style limited animation in ""A Cowboy Needs a Horse,"" or dimensional animation in ""Noah's Ark,"" with its fanciful found-object animals) they could do it better than just about anybody else.  Kids may become a tad restless at times, but animation fans and Disney completists will be in heaven.

Bottom line: If Disney's going to call these shorts ""Treasures"" they should treat them as such.",1148774400,218,1219,5.06
2393935,3,B000ATQYUG,"A real mixed bag, some people might say. Anyone unfamiliar with the Alice shorts and any or all cartoons in the collection are in for a treat. The Alice Shorts sort give a visual genesis of Walt Disney's Empire. Even though all of them are not in this collection, there's enough of 'em to move onto some cartoons one might be more familiar with. Such as Lamber the Sheepish Lion, Chicken Little, the Humphrey the Bear cartoons, ect. Then there are some ""experimental"" cartoons and shorts that are not to be overlooked.

It has been noted that the metal tin the the 2-disc set it protects has become cheaper looking. The back cover info on the tin is now a detatched piece of hard-paper. And the cartoons and shorts don't look like they've had the same restoration some of the other sets have had(the Donald Duck Vol. 2 set had a few cartoons that looked visually dirty & dark).

Alice is very appealing and funny, and they like the adaptations of the children's books, as well as the Professor Owl music lessons.  The second disc seems more academic, with some experiments in style and stop-motion animation that fall flat aesthetically and are a bore or just difficult to sit through.  I think this set is of great interest to animation history fans, but there are better choices if you're looking for something your children will want to watch, like the Mickey, Donald and Pluto sets, and for boys, the ""On the Front Lines"" set.",1143158400,12,647,4.512820512820513

2393938,1,B000ATQYUG,"This collection is important because for the first time we have a chronological collection of disney special cartoons (the series which was started by 'ferdinand the bull' before the production of silly symphonies ended with 'the ugly duckling' in 1939). I've appreciated the sectoin dedicated to Alice comedies; they're not cartoons form the special series, but they are interesting beacues were made by walt disney and his staff in the 20s before Mickey. I've rated this DVD 4, because two shorts from the serie have not been included in the collection (Susie the little blue coup , casey bats again, were released in the 50s and the collection contains the specials from 1938 to 1962).",1140480000,3,688,4.991304347826087
2393939,4,B000ATQYUG,"-- there was Alice. She was just the first of many happy surprises on this two-disc set.

Alice was a live actor, filmed against a whiteout background. That gave Disney plenty of room to fill in an animated worlds around her. This was the 1920s, so the combination of live action and animation must have been quite a surprise to the viewers of the day.

Alice isn't the only unfamiliar character in these cartoons. In fact, the only recognizably ""Disney"" character shows up in the very last cartoon. I was quite surprised at the number of different, unfamiliar characters presented. Many, like Lambert, Ferdinand, and Morris, are cel animations, as good as any of Disney's more famous characters.

Many, though, are stop-action animation, often with a jazz-era theme. ""Noah's Ark"" was one of the stop animations. Although it had crude backgrounds, the animated animals were very clever. The last cartoon in the set also presented stop animations: paper cutouts representing the major eras of America music from rag time up to big band jazz and the crooners of the 1950s.

On the whole, this set may be for the completist or serious animation fan rather than the average Disney watcher of today. Parts of it look dated or crude, but that's OK. It shows Disney works that aren't seen often, including some experiments that deserve more attention.

""Disney Rarities: Celebrated Shorts"" collects some of the most loved one-shot Disney shorts right alongside some of the most unseen! Starting all the way back with Walt's early Alice films and carrying all the way through to 1962's ""A Symposium On Popular Songs,"" the mixed bag that is this 2-disc collection provides treat after treat of beautiful animation, charming stories and songs, and fond childhood memories! Here's what you get in this gorgeous DVD set!

Disc 1:
Alice's Wonderland (1923): The first of Walt's silent Alice Comedies that combined live-action and animation, this charming short stars the adorable little Virginia Davis and costars a young Mr. Disney himself! In it, Walt gives Alice a tour of a magical animation studio which leads to an animated dream sequence for Alice that night.
Alice's Wild West Show (1924): Probably the best of the Alice comedies I've seen, and Virginia's favorite, the live-action sequences of this are very reminiscent of the early ""Little Rascals"" films, and, of course, there are animated sequences as well. Alice and her friends are putting on a wild west show, but when bullies chase her costars away, Alice resorts to telling tales of her adventures with Indians and baddies.
Alice Gets In Dutch (1924): Little Alice gets the dunce cap in school one day for playing with a balloon, and when she falls asleep on her stool, she has to deal with a cartoon teacher and her living schoolbooks!
Alice's Egg Plant (1925): Sadly, Virginia Davis is replaced by Anne Shirley in this short. Also, the charming live-action sequences give way to total animation, aside from the inclusion of live-action Alice, of course. In this story, there's trouble on Alice's egg farm when a fowl Russian bird incites a strike. Luckily, Alice and her cat Julius concoct a plan!
Alice In the Jungle (1925): Virginia is back one more time for this tale of animal hi-jinks and lion fighting adventure.
Alice's Mysterious Mystery (1926): Margie Gay plays Alice in this short where she and Julius go up against an early version of Pete who is an evil dogcatcher turning his captive mutts into sausage! Yes, this is a disturbing cartoon!
Alice the Whaler (1927): Lois Hardwick plays a slightly older Alice, who sails the seas with her animal friends in a cartoon that features a potato peeling mouse in sequences seemingly identical to those in the following year's ""Steamboat Willie!""
Ferdinand the Bull (1938): This cartoon is our sudden jump to color and sound (not including the music that accompanied the preceding Alice shorts). This is the Oscar winning tale of Ferdinand, a pacifist bull that just loves to sit and smell flowers, mistakenly chosen to fight in a bull ring when a bee sting makes him appear ferocious and wild! This is one of those classics you'll likely remember from your youth, and it also features caricatures of Walt and his animators.
Chicken Little (1943): No, this isn't Disney's new, computer-animated feature, this is a classic short about not believing everything you hear and read, with a twisted but very funny ending! I believe this is one of the several Academy Award nominees in this collection!
The Pelican and the Snipe (1944): And, here's another, I believe. One of the many shorts Disney did with Sterling Holloway (the original voice of Winnie the Pooh) as narrator, this is the cute wartime tale of a sleep-flying Pelican and his loyal and protective, sleep-deprived friend living together on a lighthouse in Uruguay. This was originally planned as part of ""The Three Amigos"" but was instead released on its own.
The Brave Engineer (1950): Here's one of my many favorites, the rousing, musical tale of Casey Jones, the brave engineer! The singing narration from Jerry Colonna and crew make this a fun-filled American adventure!
Morris, the Midget Moose (1950): Disney's Bootle Beetle characters kick-off this classic short as an elder tells two younger bugs the story of two misfit moose...meese...mooses.... whatever. One is very small, despite having full size antlers. The other is huge, but his antlers are tiny. Together, they are a powerful force!
Lambert the Sheepish Lion (1952): A favorite for Disney fans all over, this is the classic story of a lion cub mistakenly delivered to an expectant mother sheep. He is mocked and shunned by his peers, not unlike Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but when he's all grown up, he's the only one who can keep the mean ol' wolf away!
The Little House (1952): This heartwarming classic, based on the children's book, is very similar to the oddly absent from this set ""Susie, the Little Blue Coupe."" It's the tale of a little house who grows old, lonely, and depressed while the world around her changes, but in the end gets cheered up by new owners, a new locale, and a new coat of paint.
Adventures In Music: Melody (1953): Originally released in 3-D (a first for an American animated film), but just as enjoyable in 2-D, this is the first of the Professor Owl shorts where he teaches his class full of young birds all about the world of music. Very enjoyable animation.
Football Now and Then (1953): Here's a fun animated short, even if you are like me and not really interested in football! Grandpa and grandson watch a televised football match pitting a modern football time with one from yesteryear!
Adventures In Music: Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (1953): The other Oscar Winner in the bunch, here we learn the history of musical instruments in Professor Owl's class! A true classic!
Ben and Me (1953): A personal fave that is more of a featurette than a short, sure to be a hit with American history buffs that don't take it TOO seriously. This is the tale of Amos, a mouse voiced by Sterling Holloway, who is the real brains behind the legacy of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin!

Disc 2:
Pigs Is Pigs (1954): Disc 2 kicks off with an extremely enjoyable, highly fun musical romp about Flannery, a railroad station clerk whose strict adherence to the rules lands him in deep trouble when a shipment of lovestruck guinea pigs arrives.
Social Lion (1954): A lion captured on safari in Africa gets loose in the big city, but hardly anyone notices him! Very cute and funny, light social commentary short!
Hooked Bear (1956): One of the two widescreen cartoons in this set, this Humphrey the Bear short is as funny as anything the Looney Tunes ever did! In it, Humphrey does his best to outwit the fish, the tourists, and Ranger Woodlore in his attempts to load up some fish of his own!
Jack and Old Mac (1956): This imaginatively animated musical offering creatively illustrates jazzy renditions of ""The House That Jack Built"" and ""Old MacDonald."" Nicely entertaining.
In the Bag (1956): The other Humphrey the Bear widescreen cartoon in this set, this hilarious short has Ranger Woodlore scheming to use the park bears to clean up after the tourists. When the reward becomes a delicious dinner, Humphrey tries and tries but can't seem to keep his section clean! This butt-bumping extravaganza even features a cameo by Smokey the Bear!
A Cowboy Needs a Horse (1956): This captivating, musical dream shows a little boy's sleeping fantasy of being a real cowboy, battling bandits and Indians, and saving the damsel in distress. Always wanted this one in my collection!
The Story of Anyburg, USA (1957): In a humorous and twisted tale of injustice and frivolous lawsuits, this short tells the tale of a town that places the blame for automobile accidents on the automobiles themselves!
The Truth About Mother Goose (1957): This memorable old fave is one of the gems of this set! Telling the grim, true tales behind the nursery rhymes ""Little Jack Horner,"" ""Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary,"" and ""London Bridge Is Falling Down,"" this highly entertaining short is pretty dark for a Disney cartoon!
Paul Bunyan (1958): The bigger-than-life tale of Paul Bunyan the giant lumberjack is told here from his infancy to his retirement in a wonderful old Disney favorite!
Noah's Ark (1959): Stop-motion animation and household items are used for a change in this tale from the pages of Genesis in the Bible. Noah builds a great Ark to carry two of every animal, along with his family, through a flood that covered the entire globe in ancient times. This reasonably loyal and jazzy cartoon is great fun, though maybe it runs a tad long when it gets into some unnecessary Hippo romance subject matter. Still, very good little short!
Goliath II (1960): This Oscar nominated classic is the funny story of a tiny elephant the size of a mouse born to the biggest elephant in the herd! Little Goliath is nothing but trouble until he wins the others' respect by being the only one who can take on their greatest fear!
The Saga of Windwagon Smith (1961): Some may disagree, but I find this to be another of the best shorts in the set! Windwagon Smith is the tall tale of a sea captain with dreams of sailing over the American plains in a covered wagon that is part sailing ship! It's a very fun and imaginative tale!
A Symposium On Popular Songs (1962): And, finally, my favorite cartoon on this set, simply because who doesn't love Ludwig Von Drake, especially coupled with tons of Sherman Bros. music! Also pretty much a featurette at 19 minutes and 44 seconds in length, ""A Symposium On Popular Songs"" is hosted by the oddball relative of Donald Duck who takes us through the history of  popular music in America, until 1962 at least. He does this for the most part by playing timely songs that he wrote himself, running with visuals of stop-motion cut-out animation same as was used for the opening of the original ""Parent Trap."" For Ludwig fans, this cartoon is really the highlight of the discs! Paul Frees is hilarious!

As an obsessive Disney fan, I am likely to tell you that ALL the Disney Treasures sets are a must have, and keep `em coming! I certainly have them all! But, even for the collector who doesn't get every tin box that Disney puts out, ""Disney Rarities: Celebrated Shorts"" is a must! Sure, there are some shorts that are oddly absent. Some of them are available on other Disney releases though. Many seem likely to appear in an educational shorts set in the future, hopefully. I'm dying for ""Scrooge McDuck and Money,"" ""Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons,"" the ""What Should I Do"" series, ""Harold and His Amazing Green Plants,"" and Jiminy Cricket's shorts, among others. I also am desperate for a good, unedited release of ""Small One,"" Sport Goofy in ""Soccermania,"" and ""Fluppy Dogs,"" to name a few. And, to be honest, even if they can get a bit redundant, I'd like to get as many of the over 50 Alice shorts (that have not been lost) as possible. Nevertheless, this set is a REAL treasure! Extras include a wonderful interview with the original Alice, Virginia Davis, enthusiastic intros by Leonard Maltin that some find annoying but I have no problem with (there is only one per disc this time, and we really should regard this man as a hero, anyway), the VERY short advertisement cartoon ""A Feather In His Collar,"" starring Pluto, a lovely timeline featurette showing us Walt's history up to the introduction of Mickey Mouse, a fascinating audio commentary for ""A Symposium on Popular Song"" with Richard Sherman and Leonard Maltin, and, of course, a few selective art galleries. Yes, there is talk on the disc of an excerpt from a Disneyland episode detailing the making of the ""Parent Trap"" opening credits, however, it seems none of us have been able to locate that in the set except as snippets during Maltin's intros. The set comes in the expected snapcase within lovely tin box, though they are continuing with not printing anything on the back of the tin and not including the paper band, and within is the standard, handy booklet, the numbered certificate of authenticity, and a nice collectible card featuring Paul Bunyan promo art. It all makes for a glorious package for the Disney fanatic. Can't wait for wave 6!",1135900800,95,12192,4.834849210148397
2393986,4,B000ATQYUG,"5 stars for the material, but 4 stars for a presentation that comes up a bit short.

What a joy to have all these great Disney shorts on DVD.  The quality of the transfers is not as bad as I had anticipated based on what I had read here on Amazon, but ""Noah's Ark"" is disappointingly grainy and ""Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom"" has a maddeningly muddy soundtrack.

Still it's wonderful to see classics like these plus ""Ferdninand the Bull"", ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"", ""Pigs is Pigs"", ""In the Bag"" (love that catchy song!), ""Paul Bunyan"", ""A Symposium On Popular Songs"" and my personal favorite, ""Melody"", which was originally shown in 3D.  Too bad ""Suzie, the Little Blue Coupe"" isn't included as fans had originally hoped.

Once again, Leonard Maltin talks to us like we're a bunch of six year-olds, but I hear that he is the driving force behind these DVDs and I am grateful for his considerable efforts.  I do hope Maltin realizes that there are many Disney Treasures from the sixties and seventies that thousands of us would love to see as he continues these very worthy projects.

The extras are more Maltin than Disney, but they're better than nothing.  In his intro to disc two, Maltin says an excerpt from Disney's weekly show showing stop-motion animators at work - specifically as they create the title sequence to the original ""Parent Trap"" - will be shown, but it is nowhere to be seen. Unless there's an Easter Egg I'm missing I would LOVE to have seen that. Anyone have any info?

This is one of my favorite of the Disney Treasures DVDs.  Keep them coming Disney - and don't forget us children of the 60's and 70's!",1135555200,6,1628,4.582758620689655
2393987,4,B000ATQYUG,"I can't speak for owners of high definition television, but these Disney rarities look perfectly fine on a 27-inch Panasonic.  Okay, the non-anamorphically enhanced wide-screen items (""Toot, Whistle, Plunk & Boom"", ""Hooked Bear"" & ""In the Bag"") look a little soft, and the stop-mo classics (""Symposium on Popular Songs"" & ""Noah's Ark"") seem a bit faded. But otherwise, apart from some minor speckling, there's nothing to impede one's full enjoyment of these Disney classics.  Detail is sharp; colors are fabulous - far superior to previous releases on video and laserdisc. You'll have to judge for yourself, but I for one, am not disappointed.",1135123200,6,643,5.233009708737864
2393988,2,B000ATQYUG,"While I'm all for the collector tin sets to be continued, and have been a fan of the wealth of classic, never before released, historical films on them, it seems this one fell victim to the money hungry management and bean counters at Disney. The quality of these DVD's makes you think that the management that ran Disneyland into the ground for the last 10 years by not spending any money on paint or maintenance, has now been put in charge of the DVD releases.  What happened to Disney digitally remastering and making ""perfect"" all their releases onto DVD? The quality on the shorts are all washed out, grainy, scratched, and some are even in the wrong aspect ratio! What intern did you let put this together? The money that is being made off of these collector sets should be more than enough to pay for someone to restore these films and bring the quality back to par with the previously released Walt Disney Treasures.

Disney management needs to stop being so cheap. They also need to stop thinking that the ""audience is ignorant"" and will not notice if we don't restore the films or spend any money on quality; after all their just dumb consumers, they'll buy it anyway since it has the Disney name on it.

Here's the hint -- we're not stupid, and we DID notice it! Now how about fixing it and releasing what you promised?",1135036800,15,1330,4.533333333333333
2393989,2,B000ATQYUG,"I have all 18 of the Disney Treasure DVD's.  Until this year, they have been of excellent quality.  However, this year, with Disney Rarities and the Chronilogical Donald, Vol 2, I was very disappointed.

The selection of material, in both the new additions, is exemplary, as usual.  The quality of that material, however, is what leads to this poor review.  Most of the material looks like it was untouched, and certainly not remastered as the packaging would suggest, before being transferred to DVD.  Given the unforgiving nature of the medium, the material really looks poor.  So poor that it takes away from any value this set might have had to a collector, and poor enough that even a casual viewer is going to be left unsatisfied.",1135036800,18,736,4.7936507936507935
2393990,2,B000ATQYUG,"Disney really dropped the ball on this year's wave of Treasures.  While the selection of shorts on this and the Donald set are unsurprisingly good, most of the video masters used are atrocious and seem to be left over from pre-digital days.  Perhaps they thought that nobody would notice.  Guess what, Disney?  We noticed.",1134950400,16,322,4.907407407407407
2393991,1,B000ATQYUG,"At first, I was very excited to hear about the content being released on this latest wave of Disney Treasures. I grew up watching a lot of these cartoons, but haven't seen them in years, and I couldn't wait to get reaquainted.

Now I've had slight misgivings in the past over how they *present* the material on these discs with numerous, ridiculous warnings and disclaimers (many of which you can't skip past) and the fact that we have to skip past Leonard's introduction EVERY time we watch the discs does get rather annoying. But despite these concerns, there was one thing I never worried about (until now) and that is the QUALITY of the material. Up to this point, the material itself has always been beautifully remastered and has looked great! This was an aspect I didn't even think to worry about it before I ordered this disc because I trusted this line of Disney product and the people who promote it. Now I come to find out that through many advertisements and press materials, the customer has been misled to regard the new releases as up to par with the previous releases. This is simply not true! They look horrible!

Why would Disney do this? Why build up a fan base of these releases, promise them one thing, deliver it for quite a while, and then all of a sudden decide to do a 180 and screw them over? BAD BUSINESS. It's things like this that make me so upset over the current state of Disney. Their lack of concern for the customer at times is just appalling. We desperately need this problem to be fixed. As suggested, we deserve a new wave of remastered material, and a disc-swap should be put in place as soon as possible. Untll that point, I'm boycotting these releases and spreading the word as far as I can. I realize a lot of you want to see the shorts contained on these discs, as do I, but DO NOT REWARD THEM with your money for this shoddy and falsely advertised product.

Make them get it right!",1134950400,32,1924,4.444759206798867
8079777,5,B000ATQYUG,"This is one of the more oddball entries in the Walt Disney Treasures series. It features mostly one-shot cartoons that are not part of the Silly Symphonies series or feature Disney characters that only got one or two shorts. The collection also features seven select shorts from the pre-Mickey Mouse Alice Comedies. The shorts are as follows:

Disc One Shorts:

Alices Wonderland (Running Time: 12:32) 1923
Alice visits the Walt Disney Animation Studios (or The Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio at that time), where Walt Disney himself shows her various scenes on their drawing boards. The cartoons dance for her, and she dances for them. Meanwhile, lions break out of the zoo and chase her down a rabbit hole. Finally, she jumps off a cliff and awakes back in her bed from her nightmare.

Alices Wild West Show (Running Time: 12:43) 1924
Alice produces a play for the neighborhood kids where she regales the audience with her tales of cowboys and (rather stereotypical) Indians.

Alice Gets in Dutch (Running Time: 8:15) 1924
Alice misbehaves in school and is disciplined as a result. She falls asleep and dreams about her school teacher (complete with horns and a sword), is torturing her with more schoolwork.

Alices Egg Plant (Running Time: 8:34) 1925
Alice and Julius run an eggplant farm, but the chickens soon go on strike. Alice runs across two roosters fighting and suddenly comes up with an idea. In order to fill the shipment of eggs, Alice charges the hens one egg in order to watch the two roosters settle it in the ring.

Alice in the Jungle (Running Time: 7:40) 1925
Alice and Julius on safari in Africa; Alice gets chased by a lion after playing with a lion cub and Julius has to come in and rescue her.

Alices Mysterious Mystery (Running Time: 6:13) 1926
Detectives Alice and Julius search for missing puppies. An early version of Pete is behind the kidnappings and takes them to a sausage factory.

Alice the Whaler (Running Time: 6:14) 1927
Alice and Julius on board a whaling ship where they have to deal with a temperamental cook as well as harpooning a whale.

Ferdinand the Bull (Running Time 7:55) 1938
Ferdinand is a quiet, peaceful young bull who only wants to stop and smell the flowers as the narrator implies. When he is stung by a bee, the townspeople believe he is ferocious and take him to the bullfight ring only to be astonished that he isn't as ferocious as the townspeople believe.

Chicken Little (Running Time: 8:50) 1943
In this World War II propaganda allegory version of the famous fable, gullible Chicken Little now believes that the sky is falling thanks to Foxy Loxys psychology manual and leads every chicken, duck, and hen into panic and ultimately gets eaten up by Foxy Loxy.

The Pelican and the Snipe (Running Time: 8:40) 1944
Originally planned to be part of The Three Caballeros, and as such has a slightly Latin feel and takes place in Uruguay. This story is about two bird pals, Monte, a sleep-flying pelican and Viddi, a snipe who has to guard the pelican from danger. This is the first of several shorts on this set narrated by Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Poohs voice).

The Brave Engineer (Running Time: 7:40) 1950
This is a retelling of The Ballad of Casey Jones, in which Casey has to simply arrive on time with his train, which is way tougher than it sounds.

Morris the Midget Moose (Running Time: 8:00) 1950
A cute tale about a tiny moose with humongous antlers, who has to take on Thunderclap the moose champion.

Lambert the Sheepish Lion (Running Time: 8:18) 1952
Yet another misfit story about a stork, or more likely, the stork from Dumbo, who accidentally delivers a baby lion to a sheep herd.

The Little House (Running Time: 8:21) 1952
Based on the 1942 book written by Virginia Lee Burton, the story centers on a living house on the country who gets depressed as progress brings a ever-living city around her after her owners left.

Adventures in Music: Melody (Running Time: 10:06) 1953
The first cartoon in 3D, in an attempt to cash in on the 3D craze, this one is highly stylized, apparently inspired by the graphic quality of the contemporary UPA cartoons at the time. This cartoon marks the first appearance of the music-teaching Professor Owl and his class who would return in the Disney Sing-Along Songs series in the early 1980s.

Football Now and Then (Running Time: 7:30) 1953
In a style similar to Goofys How To and The Art Of, this is more of a discussion between grandfather and grandson leads to a game between an old-style football team and a modern one than an actual story.

Adventures in Music: Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (Running Time: 10:18) 1953
In Disneys first cartoon in CinemaScope, the cartoon uses the same cast as Melody, uses the same UPA animation techniques, uses a more linear storyline, uses stereophonic sound and has won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It also has some nasty Asian and Blackface stereotypes, these stereotypes are intact in the Disney Rarities print, unlike previous prints of the short, in addition to being in its original CinemaScope ratio.

Ben and Me: (Running Time: 21:03) 1953
A retelling about how a mouse named Amos was responsible for Benjamin Franklins achievements. This featurette is missing footage, though that is because the missing footage was created for the Disneyland episode: The Liberty Story.

Bonus Features:

Alice's Cartoon World: An Interview with Virginia Davis: Leonard Maltin interviews Virginia Davis, who portrayed the little girl, Alice, in Walt's silent comedies of the 1920s

From Kansas City to Hollywood: A Timeline of Disney's Silent Era: A featurette about Walt Disney's journey into the entertainment industry, from an ad company in Kansas City up to the discovery of synchronized sound.

Disc Two Shorts:

Pigs Is Pigs (Running Time: 9:43) 1954
A rather ridiculous musical story with more UPA animation on board, this story concerns a stubborn train station attendant and a client arguing over the freight charge on two guinea pigs which eventually multiply into a large amount of guinea pigs causing havoc.

Social Lion (Running Time: 6:49) 1954
To sum it up, its about a lion who wants to get captured, in order to be brought to the city, no one is afraid of him, until he puts on a suit. Because of this, they realize that hes a lion and brought him to the zoo.

Hooked Bear (Running Time: 6:16) 1956
Humphrey the Bear, who got his debut in the Goofy cartoon Hold That Pose, finally had a solo short that involves him trying to catch as much fish as he can. He can be viewed as a precursor to Yogi Bear as Humphrey the Bear matched wits against a similar ranger, J. Audubon Woodlore. Unfortunately, he only lasted two measly shorts and never took off into a full-fledged series. The cartoon is in the CinemaScope aspect ratio.

Jack and Old Mac (Running Time: 7:03) 1956
This short is more of a package film than anything else that showcases two songs in two different visual styles: words come to life in The House That Jack Built, and Old MacDonald has a band segment.

In The Bag (Running Time: 7:35) 1956
In the last RKO-distributed Disney cartoon, and the last standalone Humphrey short, Woodlore fools Humphrey and his bear friends into cleaning up the park. Much like Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Hooked Bear is in its CinemaScope ratio. Smokey Bear makes a surprise cameo saying his famous line, Remember, Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires!

A Cowboy Needs A Horse (Running Time: 6:54) 1956
In this cartoon, a small boy dreams and becomes a cowboy fighting off Indians, (like the ones in Alices Wild West Show)

The Story of Anyburg, U.S.A. (Running Time: 10:30) 1957
The short centers around where a town puts an unfortunate automobile on trial.

The Truth About Mother Goose (Running Time: 14:42) 1957
All this short does is give old-fashioned nursery rhymes a jazz makeover, while an off screen narrator explains their origins in three animated vignettes.

Paul Bunyan (Running Time: 16:58) 1958
Based off the famous tall tale, Paul and his ox, Babe will have to defeat Joe Maffaw in order to to prove that nothing can replace the heart and soul of himself and Babe, while Joe counters that his steam-saw and engine can cut and haul more timber than any man or ox.

Noahs Ark (Running Time: 20:47) 1959
Based off the Biblical tale, a great heavenly voice told Noah that ""within a week, he will wash the wickedness away, because there was much fussin and fightin and sinnin (according to the narrator), Noah will have to build an ark made of gopher wood to save himself and two of each animal. This is one of the most curious shorts in Disney Rarities, due to the short resembling the average stereotypical Rankin/Bass Animagic specials than the average Disney short. While the people puppets are relatively simple, the animals are cleverly constructed out of simple household items. The songs however, are morbidly bland, cheesy, and leave a lot to be desired.

Goliath II (Running Time: 15:05) 1960
After some UPA and Rankin/Bass-like experimental projects, we return to the typical dull ugly duckling formula that Lambert the Sheepish Lion demonstrated. Though from there on the Xerox-process would be used for much of its animated features, (such as the following years 101 Dalmatians) Story-wise, Goliath II is about the titular miniature elephant who tries to impress his father, the biggest one of all.

The Saga of Windwagon Smith (Running Time: 13:24) 1961
The story concerns a prairie sailor who uses a wagon with a sail to cross the Old West. The animation is also unlike any other in any of the shorts in the collection.

A Symposium On Popular Songs (Running Time: 19:46) 1962
In the last short in the collection, we end with the only theatrical appearance of Ludwig Von Drake, who first appeared in Walt Disneys Wonderful World of Color on NBC. This short combines Rankin/Bass like stop-motion puppets, paper cut-outs, and traditional animation with catchy songs to boot. Von Drake demonstrates the popularity of 20th century music. The music is performed by none other than the Sherman Brothers.

Bonus Features

Audio Commentary: Heard over A Symposium On Popular Songs, Leonard Maltin interviews Richard M. Sherman who with his brother Robert wrote the songs for the short as well as several Disney films and theme park attractions from the 1960s2000s.

A Feather in His Collar (Running Time: 1:20) 1946
Pluto demonstrates donating to his local community chest.

Galleries: These galleries include assortments of concept art, storyboard sketches and background paintings for Ferdinand the Bull, The Little House, The Story of Anyburg, U.S.A, and Chicken Little.

It would be awesome if Casey Bats Again, Susie, the Little Blue Coupe, Scrooge McDuck and Money, or Its Tough to Be a Bird were included, and the collection is fairly light on the extras but Im content with what Ive got here. Another problem is that most of the shorts are unrestored with Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Alice's Egg Plant, Paul Bunyan, and Noah's Ark being examples. The last problem is that while Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom is in its 2.35:1 CinemaScope ratio, Hooked Bear and In The Bag are NOT in their 2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio. Hooked Bear and In The Bag are in the 1.9:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio, which is not the right CinemaScope ratio for the shorts. All CinemaScope cartoons are also non-anamorphic. Those Humphrey cartoons look soft as well. Overall, despite its flaws, this is a nice collections of shorts.",1525564800,,11521,4.845723014256619
