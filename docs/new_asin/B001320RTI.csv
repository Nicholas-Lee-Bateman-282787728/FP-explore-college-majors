8248722,1,B001320RTI,Horrible.... Documentaries should illustrate facts and be unbiased to allow the viewer to come to their own conclusion. This is a typical Michael Moore style film. Complete Trash,1408406400,,178,5.392857142857143
8248723,1,B001320RTI,"This is pitched at the level of the political dreck you might hear from your neighbor down the street.

Was this produced by the California Democrat Party?

It even shows comedians' routines where they make fun of him, over and over again, and runs Richard Nixon's Checkers speech, comparing that to Arnold's comments about how much he loves his dogs.

I was hoping for a serious biography on Arnold Schwarzenegger, and instead saw a piece of trash.",1368921600,,449,4.805194805194805
8248724,5,B001320RTI,"A far better use of ones time is watching Last Action Hero.
Would you like to run with Arnold? Would you run with, behind
or against Mr. Schwarzenegger? Side-by-Side? Exactly.",1324339200,,175,4.866666666666666
8248725,1,B001320RTI,"I generally don't give any review a 1-star.  I know it hurts creators' feelings.
 However,this work is an exception.  This documentary on Arnold is terribly biased and extremely unfair.  All in all, it's out of the question.

 I've read Arnold's 400-pages-long biography from cover to cover, line by line before.
 Let me give you just one example why this movie is biased;
 This documentary suggests that Arnold admires Hitler and the Nazi party based on the fact his father was a member of the Nazi party and Arnold made a toast to Former Austrian President (also a former Nazi)upon his wedding.
 To be fair, it's not a secret his father was a Nazi.
 However, this movie doesn't mention Arnold didn't even attend his funeral.
 Plus, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre already conducted a thorough research on his father's background and found no charge on his track record.  Period.  The end of story.
 How can you blame someone for what his father did even before he was born?  Again, it's not fair.  I hate it.",1236729600,3,1006,4.728323699421965
8248726,1,B001320RTI,You have to wonder what the liberals behind this are so angry about. Arnold turned into a liberal in California. This documentary is what you expect from Republican haters. Some of the source material for this is awful and looks as though it was captured from youtube.  Coudln't they go to the source tapes? It's a low budget piece of trash.,1228003200,2,341,4.590163934426229
8248727,2,B001320RTI,"This work is both like and different from Moore's ""Farenheit 911.""  Both are meant to make Republican leaders look bad.  However, Moore's work could have affected how one voted in November of 2004.  This work does not anticipate an election by Ahnuld.  I haven't heard anything about Moore's personal life that revolts me.  However, many are very disappointed about the answering machine message that Alec Baldwin, the narrator here, left for his daughter Ireland.  Baldwin's house is not in order, yet he is throwing stones.
If you are like me, then you love male nudity, especially from muscular men.  The work shows the clip in ""Terminator"" where you see Ahnuld's bottom.  But the Internet is filled with two photos where you see his front door and they don't show all of those two photos here.
Alec narrates that Ahnuld posed for gay magazines and supported one gay rights measure in California.  Uh, that's a good thing if you support gay rights and oppose homophobia.  However, this work presents that info as if it were bad.  The work belittles the donation that Ahnuld made to the Weisenthal Center, but giving to a center that helps fight oppression and bigotry is a good thing.
This work may be dated.  It never says that Ahnuld won his election against Angelides fair and square, with no recall.  The people of California have given him voting support before; it's hard to say that they are being manipulated when they chose him as their leader with eyes wide open.
I'm progressive and will never vote for Ahnuld, but to me, this work fails to demonize him in a way that viewers would vote against him.  I never thought he was the scum of the Earth and that's what the documentary makers goal was.  If a man can make his first million by age 21, marry a Kennedy, and become governor of the most populous American state, then so be it.  There are far too many other people scarier than Ahnuld for me to accept this work hook, line, and sinker.",1209859200,,1953,4.633720930232558
