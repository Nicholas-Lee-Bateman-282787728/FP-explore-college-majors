8474518,4,B005IEDGUE,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles. Lots of sword fighting in this movie and for its time, the fights are pretty well choreographed even though there are moments of slow fights.  Most scenes are done in a studio, but the cinematography is well done.  A bandit murders and steals gold from a wealthy family.  The constable (police chief) is searching for this bandit even though he doesn't know what they look like. Later, the constable finds out that the bandit is made of four guys.  These four individuals separated after four major robberies/killings.  One of the bandit members is a father of a blind woman.  He has a very caring relationship with his daughter.  When the constable catches up to him, they get into a fight in which the constable gets hurt.  The constable retreated to a nearby home, and it turns out to be the home of the blind woman.  She cares for the constable.  However, the father returns home later and now there is a major dilemma.  The constable fell in love with the blind daughter, but he has to capture the father.  The father loves his daughter and doesn't want her to know that he's been a member of a gang that kills and loot the wealthy.  They ended up taking their business far from the daughter to ensure she knows nothing of what is going on as they both care about her.  Easy to understand story.",1517788800,,1345,4.526970954356846
