1757467,1,B00006HBUA,"My wife wanted to see this movie, even though I told her it would stink. So I went with her. (WE WENT TO SEE THIS INSTEAD OF MINORITY REPORT!)
The movie is just horrible. The acting was okay, but the plot and the story (was displeasing). I thought the actors they picked were on the mark for the characters they were portraying, but let me tell you something, my erudite movie watching friends, if you hate a certain other dog that often frequented the later version of SD, then you will absolutely HATE THIS MOVIE.
I don't mean you will disklike it, I mean you will abhor it.
My wife turned to me after the movie was over and said.
""That sucked.""
Never have truer words been said, dear wife.",1031270400,2,692,4.3307692307692305
1757468,4,B00006HBUA,"""Did he just write the words 'smart' and 'witty' in reference to the new 'Scooby Doo' movie?"" you might ask. Well, yes I just did! I saw this film in the movie theatre on a blind date, and we both had a great time...and mind you, we went at a matinee on a Sunday. The theatre was swarming with kids, and you know what? Still had a good time.
The film's greatest strengths lie in its screenplay and in its amazing cast. The screenplay wisely spoofs the ""Scooby Doo"" cartoon gently, while at the same time paying loving homage to it. This is not a mean parody, but obviously the work of a writer who understood ""Scooby"" and, as a fan, is better able to crack jokes about everything from the purported drug subtext to the detestable Scrappy Doo. A ""Scooby"" project that will actually admit what a horrible creature Scrappy is...well, you just have to respect that. No, this movie does not have a deep plot...but, IT'S SCOOBY DOO! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO! How many ""Scooby"" cartoons have you seen that have changed your life? Ummm? Did you just say ""None""? Now, you get the point!
I will say that the film breaks the ""Scooby"" rule only in one area. The ""surprise"" ending where they reveal the identity of the bad guy...is actually a surprise. Which is really quite surprising in and of itself.
Now I have to rave about two particular cast members...Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Lillard, who were so pitch-perfect in their respective renditions of Daphne and Shaggy that you would swear that the cartoon versions were ripped right off the animation cells and brought to life. SMG has proven her comedy chops and brilliant sense of timing in ""Cruel Intentions,"" and on special comedic episodes of ""Buffy."" Well, this is her first full-out comedic role in a film that you'll actually want to see (I'm discounting ""Simply Irresistable""...Ugh!), and she is a joy to watch. In one particularly great scene, she and Fred's souls switch bodies. Her jubilant expressions, when she, as Fred, touches Daphne's breasts, are an absolute riot. And there's Matthew Lillard, who captures all the sweetness, innocence, lovability and doltishness of Shaggy. He is not only funny but actually touching at times.
Freddie Prinze and the girl who played Velma are not quite as good...but they're more than passable.
The computer-animated Scooby, however, is wonderful. It perfectly mixes the look of a ""real"" dog with cartoonish expressions. In fact, from posters and TV commericals, I thought Scooby looked not so great, but when you see him in the movie for extended periods, he looks absolutley perfect. He is far better than most CGI I've seen in any film (leaves ""Harry Potter""'s pathetic attempts at CGI in the dust), except for, perhaps, ""Lord of the Rings.""
With all of this said, I'm not sure how well this movie would play for someone who is not a fan of the cartoon or has just never seen it. The movie is very dependant on in-jokes, so my review is from the persepective of a Scooby-phile. If you are one, I promise you will dig this movie. If you aren't, you might still enjoy it, but not quite ""get"" all of it. I'd recommend a weekend spent watching reruns on the Cartoon Network before you watch this film.",1031184000,5,3197,4.690391459074733
1757469,5,B00006HBUA,"My favortie musical of all time is Newsies ,my favortie drama film is An Unexpected Family,my favortie T.V show is Little House .Still my favortie movie of all time that I would give five stars all the time is Scooby Doo.
PLOT:Something evil is lurking around Spooky Island and is doing something too the collage students that visit ,of course with the lovable great dane and the Mystery Inc crew they will get too the bottom of this mystery
CAST:The cast is superbly casted by a genius Paul Renkens does the voice of the lovable great dane who has a irrestible appeite for Scooby snacks,Freddie Prinze Jr plays the egostical still warm hearted Fred very well infact I see no diffrence in them what so ever ,Linda Cardellni plays Velma or the Velmester as Fred would call her she plays her role too a key so brainy and smart just like her role ,Sarah Michelle Gellar famously known for Buffy:The Vampire Slayer fits perfectly when it comes too ... kicking red headed fashion model Daphne ,though of course Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy perfectly he got everything right just like the whole cast did .
RATING:PG (For some crude humor ,adult language ,and some scary moments)
RUNNING TIME:1 hour and 28 minutes
DIRECTOR:Raja Gosnell (Big Momma's house)
REVIEW:On a scale of 1 to 5 ,5.5 .This movie is perfect for kids from ages 12 to 15 and also perfect for those young at heart .

My 2 year old is obsessed with Scooby, and she loved the movie, I think almost all the kids in the theater that day did, I've never seen so many little kids glued to a movie like that, if your child loves Scooby Doo then they would probably like the movie.

1757535,3,B00006HBUA,I was still young enough to remember on Saturday mornings when I would sit watching cartoons all morning.  But I never did watch this.  But this is a pretty good movie.

1757654,3,B00006HBUA,"There is a certain amount of mindless fun involved in this live-action version of the popular animated TV series.  So the unfortunate casting of Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred doesnt really matter much because they didn't set out to make art.  They didn't set out to make crap either but they were closer to achieving that goal than the other.  The only thing that really salvages this movie is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  It pains me to say that as I cannot abide Lillard in anything else hes done.  The cartoon dog is okay.  Linda Cardellini is okay as Velma.  The plot is contrived.  After splitting up as a team, they are forced to rejoin when they all receive mysterious invitations to Spooky Island.  They quickly find a real mystery to solve and become friends once more.

This is kind of like junk food.  Youll hate yourself afterwards for eating too much, but while you are mindlessly chewing the crud you find that you really don't mind that it isn't good for you.",1464566400,,970,4.5491329479768785

1757840,2,B00006HBUA,"OK, it's meant to entertain kids and coerce adults getting enhanced interrogation, and was not a strong contender for the ""best movie"" Oscar.  The leading actors' performances weren't up to their level of the sequel, Scooby-Doo 2, but it was well cast for the Mystery Incorporated gang and there is some fun as the characters realize the stereotypical roles they each have portrayed in the cartoons.  It's very loud with too much focus on special effects.  Nice to see Rowan Atkinson even in a limited role.  If you don't appreciate the animated ""Scooby-Doo"" character, you'll truly dislike this one as there is an even more annoying animated character called ""Scrappy Doo"" (you'll wish him a one-way trip to the animal shelter).  If you dislike comedy about explosive emissions of bodily gasses, you won't like this one.

If the kids really want to see a Scooby-Doo movie in your presence, I'd recommend you jump over this one and watch ""Scooby Doo 2"" instead.",1431129600,,961,4.901234567901234

Now that i'm grown, and i'm so used to the digital cartoons, it can be a bit tedious watching old scooby episodes.  I do miss the backgrounds that keep repeating themselves as the characters run though :)  Anyway, I wanted my kids to get into the roots of animation...and it has been a challenge holding their attention.  but then, BAM, here is a live action, CGI heavy, A.D.D era movie that got my little boy's attention!

The movie is pretty funny actually. The acting is also pretty darn good considering..  The guy who plays shaggy does a great job, Sarah Michelle Gellar is like a stick-person channeling Daphne, and Freddy Prinze Jr. does a decent Fred.  Digital scooby is cool too.  But let me tell you something, Velma, now she's hot!  In the second installment (scooby doo 2), she's even hotter!  I would watch this again just for hot Velma.

1757995,4,B00006HBUA,"It was great. Calculated, clever, and great.

Knowing that the audience would probably be a lot of adults who enjoyed the cartoons as kids, the writers combined things we love about the cartoon with the obvious flaws: what would Fred REALLY do for a living if the gang broke up? What would a Velma journey of self-discovery look like?

Best of all, they took the most hated SD villain of all time (and I don't mean the Black Knight Ghost) and finally gave him what he deserved.

Matthew Lillard is perfect as Shaggy. Linda Cardellini is near-perfect--a tad prettier than I imagined Velma to be, but she somehow mimics a cartoon character while authentically actin, not an easy task. Sarah Michelle Gellar acts perfectly as Daphne even if physically she isn't a just-right fit--leaving us with Freddie Prinze, who is not bad as Fred. His acting and voice are perfect but not his physique. The producers wanted a real-life couple for Fred and Daphne so that's who we got.

Although Rowan Atkinson is a good villain, the part seems to have been written for someone else--and was. The very different Tim Curry was cast but bowed out after he found out who the real villain was, illustrating how passionate we are about that character.

Not as wonderful as SD 2, Monsters Unleashed, but witty, well-performed, and worth your time.",1392163200,,1325,4.7685589519650655

1758133,3,B00006HBUA,"Scooby and the gang of Mystery, Inc. are invited to Spooky Island to try and solve a case where some sinister madman is transforming wild teenagers into mild-mannered college students using ancient voodoo rituals! The classic cartoon capers of Mystery, Inc. have finally reached the silver screen in SCOOBY DOO, but this isn't the film that fans have been waiting for. James Gunn's script pokes fun at the cartoon series, which is fine since the show is rife for parody, but the characters he creates and the overall mood of the entire picture lack the spirit of the original television show. For all of the extravagant sets and big name actors, one would hope that director Raja Gosnell could have invested a little more time and money into the ugly computerization that was used for Scooby and the monsters. Even if the creatures were made to look cartoony to avoid frightening the children in the audience, it does not excuse the tacky special effects. Sadly, the film doesn't even include so much as a cameo by any of the classic monsters, and instead adopts a whole new set of villains that kids are unlikely to remember. In trying to be hip to modern, SCOOBY DOO loses much of its magic, and makes Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze look like a couple of buffoons on screen. Only Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini truly capture the essense of the original characters. Had the makers gone with the initial plans to make this a campy throwback to the 70's like in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, the film may have worked, but unfortunately SCOOBY DOO is a wasted opportunity that is unlikely to please generations new or old.

(I Know what you did last summer) plays Freddie, Matthew Lillard (SLC Punk) plays Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini (Freaks & Geeks) plays Velma. The four leads portray their characters in an amazing way.

The movie also has a lot of mean-spirited moments like Shaggy wanting to sacrifice his friends in order to save himself. In-fact, none of the cast members act nothing like the ones in the cartoon. Its use of supernatural elements is out of place in the Scooby-Doo World and I'm not counting the 1980's/1990's TV movies. The dumbest part of the movie is finding out that Scrabby-Doo(Scooby-Doo's Nephew) was the villain the whole time mainly because it was poorly handled. The only upside is Matthew Lillard's performance but it still fails to help in the film in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1345248000,,797,4.355704697986577

 Scooby-Doo began as an animated cartoon on CBS in 1969-76 and ABC in 1976-86, 1988-91.
  It was about a skinny long-haired teenager named ""Shaggy"" (voiced by Casey Kasem) who was the dog owner of a friendly great dane, ""Scooby-Doo"" (voiced by Don Messick). Together they were always hungry. Especially hamburgers. Scooby-Doo loved getting a Scooby snack. Their friends were Fred (voiced by Frank Welker), the red-head Daphne (voiced by Indria Stefanianna Christopherson) and Velma (voiced by Nicole Jaffe).
  Together they were known as Mystery Inc. and traveled in the groovy Mystery machine van. Usually they visited a haunted housed to solve the case of a lurking ghost.
  The ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" song was performed by Larry Marks and Paul Costello.

 Scooby-Doo continued in the spin-offs, ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" (1988-91), What's New, Scooby-Doo (2002-06), Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue! (2006-08), Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated (2010-present).

1758287,1,B00006HBUA,"My title and rating are the short version of my opinion of the film. If you want to find out the specific reasons why, read on. If not, go get yourself a Scooby Snack. On second thought, get a Scooby Snack anyway.
As the movie starts, the gang is busy catching another spook-business as usual in other words. However, disagreement about division of credit produces an angry shouting match between Fred, Daphne, and Velma and the members of the gang go their separate ways. Then a call from an amusement park director with a spooky problem brings them all to the same place-and back together as they solve the mystery to save those involved, and themselves.
One of the things I generally dislike about remakes is the tendency of the directors to 'update' things, thus changing the original story drastically and often horribly. In the story, it is especially evident in the characters of Fred and Daphne.
In the original cartoon, Fred comes across as at least as in intelligent as a normal person (despite his famous traps). He is able to laugh at his own mistakes and in spite of his constant use of Shaggy and Scooby as bait,Fred will rescue them if they get into serious trouble. In short, he is the type of man you might be very pleased if your daughter brought home (his involving her in mysteries aside). But in recent remakes, it seems the fashion to portray Fred as an idiot, and in this case, he is also unbearably conceited and missing the gentlemanly silence on sexual matters of his cartoon counterpart. It is an unnecessary assault on the character, to my mind, and one that destroys part of the good-humored carefree-ness of the original series.
The second character to be deconstructed is Daphne. Daphne is famous as the damsel-in-distress of Mystery Inc. (and with some reason). I am not sure she is stupid or entirely helpless, but she is danger-prone. In this film, the makers decided to feminist-ize her character. This upgrade seems to wreak havoc with the story. For one thing, it seems to go along with dumbing down the male characters, which seems to me to violate the ideal of gender equality Also, it happens all at once. Now, before you accuse me of chauvinism, let me point out that a male character also cannot be elevated suddenly to prominence without upsetting matters-the infamous Wesley Crusher, for instance. If change occurs, it must be done carefully, or the other characters will be steamrollered by their counterpart.
While I am referring to the faults, I felt the later scenes drew too close to black magic for viewing. In the original stories, the villain was always a non-supernatural person, who the gang inevitably captured and unmasked. This story seems to plunge into the world of black magic, and I believe it is inappropriate for viewing, even in the context of a villain's plotting.
In conclusion, the basic reason I disliked this film comes down to six words-what was changed from the series. This may sound like the ravings of a die-hard fan to you, but I believe the story, with its decent heroes and kid-friendly plots, was changed for the worst. The very identity of the world seemed changed. In short, to return to my title, I found myself consistently wondering, ""Scooby Doo, where are you?""",1321574400,,3245,4.765541740674956
1758288,4,B00006HBUA,"My son is a huge Scooby Doo fan and he loves the 2nd movie like this so I decided to get him this one...haven't watched it yet, but for the price how could I refuse.",1320105600,,165,3.742857142857143
1758289,3,B00006HBUA,"Being a fan of the original cartoon I went to see this live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" in the theater in June, 2002 (Was it that long ago?). After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. But after seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.

What most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. as Fred was acceptable while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne wasn't quite right for the role, although serviceable; I'm sure she got the role because of her popularity at the time. The addition of the winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane is a peripheral highlight. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002) and holds up pretty well.

What disappointed me on my initial viewing? I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's ""The Flinstones."" What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the ""Spooky Island"" segment, which comprises the 2nd and 3rd acts, which amounts to a full hour of the film. What's wrong with this large chunk of the movie? The whole ""Spooky Island"" set was just too cartooney for a live-action homage. It's hard to explain, but it just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the film's based on a cartoon (aduh).

Viewing it a second time, I had the same impressions of the film up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. How so? I still don't like the limitations of the ""Spooky Island"" set but I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but now I see that my feelings were pretty much universal. What's wrong with Scrappy-Doo? Scrappy rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of the ""Brady Bunch,"" of course).

The film runs 86 minutes, which is perfect for cartooney fare like this, and was shot in Queensland, Australia.

FINAL WORD: This live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" is definitely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features cutie Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.

1758292,4,B00006HBUA,"Contrary to some other reviews that Scooby Doo follows a formula of battling ghosts, demons, zombies, and terrifying creepies, only to find the culprit in simple explanation of a hidden force, usually the town outcast, you might want to take into regard the animated Scooby Doo On Zombie Island where they find that the mansion they are investigating is indeed haunted with real ghosts, and the island is indeed inhabited by real life zombies, among other things that should scare the very young like women turning into cat people. Therefore, this movie breaks no new ground by giving us real monsters for the Mystery Inc. clan to discover or battle, and Im sure that any nasty little dialogue heard hear has not already been addressed to the very young by simply going to regular school with other kids. All the cast members do their very best, and appear expertly picked for the parts. Even CGI Scooby gives a great little performance that makes you forget, he's not even there when they filmed it.

1758293,2,B00006HBUA,"This movie was disappointing. The thing that is interesting about the Scooby-Doo mysteries, is that there are no such things as ghosts and monsters - there is always some person ""behind the mask"". This movie completely turns that upside-down. In this movie, there is a cult of creepy monsters that exist and suck-out people's souls. This act seemed almost violent for kids to watch. I was horrified that they would take the basic premises of the series and turn it supernatural. My 7 year old was terrified - I wish I had previewed it.

I will say that it is worth watching just for the performance of the Shaggy and Velma characters - wow! They seemed like the cartoons brought to life.

I recommend Scooby-Doo 2 where there is a classic mystery with a real person behind it and the movie is still full of CGI creepy stuff for older kids. There is also a nice message of being happy with yourself and not trying to be someone that your not.",1286323200,,941,4.497076023391813

I've always loved Scooby-Doo since i was a kid (I'm 21 now) and I remembered watching the original Scooby-Doo Where Are You episodes, The Scooby-Doo movies, The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo show, A Pup Named Scooby Doo (which I absolutely loved!) and the recent animated movies. Oh, plus What's New Scooby Doo! I remember, when I first heard of the release of this movie in 2002, I was really excited! One of everyone's favorite cartoon been brought to life! I was even more excited to hear that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. would be the leads in the movie as Daphne and Fred. Their previous movies were mostly really cool, and neither of them are bad on the eye (they're both GORGEOUS!). When I saw the movie, I was blown away! This movie was PERFECT! Really fun and funny, action-packed, filled with jokes and also pretty scary. That was even more than I really expected. WAY MORE!

The CGI Scooby was top-notch (making him look like a real dog, making him cartoony and funny at the same time and leaving him intact as the actual cartoon must've been really hard, BUT THEY PULLED IT OFF 100%

The characters, Shaggy, Daphne, Fred and Velma, played by Matthew Lillard, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Linda Cardellini were dead-on their cartoon counterparts. To me, this cast was perfect, they really felt like a group of friends (well, Sarah and Freddie were engaged during this [and they have such chemistry!] and Matthew had appeared with Freddie in other flicks and are really good friends). I think this cast actually made me like the characters even more. Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy, no questions. Linda Cardellini IS Velma (and she even made her quite sexy) Freddie Prinze Jr. IS SO Fred (quite funny performance by the way). But Sarah Michelle Gellar completely blowed me away! She made Daphne so much better than the actual cartoon character. That ain't an easy feat. I liked how she gave Daphne that edge and spunk, while still looking completely stunning in 6'' inch high pink go-go boots.

Everything in this movie was REALLY WELL MADE. The CGI effects, the sets (HUGE and IMPRESSIVE), the costumes (I LOVE how they made Mystery Inc. look, they seemed cooler, more modern, but still retaining their cartoonish charm...

I really can't say enough of this movie! I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! I saw it in theaters, bought it on VHS, then DVD, seen it like 5+ times and still love it! I can't wait to own it on Blu-Ray and see how it looks!

This movie has everything= Cartoon mega-hit brought to life even better than the original, FUNNY, WITTY, COLORFUL, ACTION-PACKED, GREAT CHARACTERS and PERSONALIZATION, HORROR and so MUCH MORE!! That's SCOOBY DOO! Gotta love it!",1243987200,,2727,4.793617021276596

1758298,4,B00006HBUA,"I bought the Blu-Ray version because it was a reasonable price and I already had a full-screen copy of the DVD that drove me nuts to watch on a widescreen TV.  This pretty much says I already enjoyed the flick.  It's mindless and fun, and that's what makes it entertaining.

There is definitely better picture quality with the Blu-Ray version when compared to the standard DVD.  There is far more pixelating in the standard DVD that is non-existent in the Blu-Ray version. But, the Blu-Ray version is not as flawless as it should be. Any flaws existing in the original film at the time of transfer (or flaws created during the transfer itself) will make their way to the high-def disc.

I noticed a lot of very ""active"" backgrounds in many of the early scenes.  So much so, it's almost distracting.  At one point, Shaggy's green shirt even seems to be ""moving"".  But, later in the movie, everything looks stable and sharp as Blu-Ray should be.  This suggests to me that either the original movie has some flaws, or the there was some kind of issue with the transfer process itself.  Maybe there's some kind of compression going on???

All in all though, for $14 from Amazon, I would still recommend the Blu-Ray version.  Just go into it without an image of perfection.  Sit back, don't be critical and enjoy the flick.",1221782400,7,1318,4.629310344827586

Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are so believable it is a bit scarry.  Sarah Michelle Geller and Freddie Prince Jr. do a fair job but this is not some of their better work.
I know I know it is a recreation of a cartoon but I expected a lot better.  I think there is a story here that would be a good movie but I think they either did not have the budget they needed to do it right or the director needs to go back to school.  The movie does have a few laughs and would do a good job of scaring a 6 or younger  but I am not sure parts are appropriate for children of that age.  When it breaks down to a fart and burping contest between Shaggie and Scooby I think the movie hits a real low point.  It also makes me wonder how desperate they were for footage to leave it in the final cut.
I gave it three stars because I did find some entrainment in it and my 9 year old has liked it for a couple of years.  I would have only given it two stars if I were reviewing it for the older crowd above the age of 20 at least.
I am not sure if HD DVD helps or hinders it.  I am still trying to figure out what we ever saw in VHS after seeing DVD's and now that I have seen HD even up converted movies don't stack up at times.  So if your just trying to find movies to get a collection going or if you have a kid this is not a bad investment but if you want to save a few bucks I would suggest getting this and the Scooby Doo two movie together for the price you would be a bit ahead and save your money for action, science fiction, or music that would look and sound incredible on HD DVD.",1201478400,,1709,3.8295454545454546

Scooby-Doo had alot of potential--the CGI Scooby was done pretty well, the rest of the gang was fairly well-cast, and the actor who played Shaggy was all but perfect for the role. But the plot is terrible--I bought the DVD, watched it once, and have never wanted to watch it again. I can't understand why movies like this even see release on a format that is still very new--why waste money putting out junk like this when there are much better movies that haven't seen release? In my opinion (and that's all it is), a good 1/4 or 1/5 of the Blu-Ray titles available are like that. I just scratch my head trying to figure out who would *want* something like that in hi-def. Maybe if you have alot of money to waste, I guess.

Scooby-Doo is the kind of movie to buy from the discount DVD rack for $5, knowing not to expect much. It's B-movie fare, sort of fun--but not worth having in hi-def.

Hopefully the video format war won't drag on for too long--then movie studios can get down to releasing more of the big-name films they're currently holding back on.",1195862400,2,1283,4.497854077253219

Then about half way through Scrappy Doo who is upset because he didn't get what he wants decides to take revenge and PEES all over the girls.  I could not believe they would put such filth in a movie geared toward families and children.  The people who made this film are really sick in the head and should think about working on more adult oriented films to satisfy their obvious ""creative"" needs.  I have no problem with adult material but it belongs in an R or NC-17 rated film.  Films like this are the ones giving Hollywood a bad name.  Kids might think its funny when a dog pees on someone but kids also think just about anything is funny.  Like it or not Kids learn alot from movies and TV about acceptable behavior and tend to emulate what they think is funny for attention.  How many children after seeing this film threw a tantrum and then peed on one of their siblings or parents?

Given that the movie is just ok, the HD DVD presentation is fantastic!!  The image on the HD DVD is nothing short of outstanding.  The movie has a great transfer and the colors just pop off the screen.  While this is great and all but in some points this can be a bad thing and a little scary as Pamela Anderson can be seen in all her flaws!!!  As can Freddy Prince Jr.'s bad acting, but you can overlook all that when you see the image.

The audio on this disc is also delightful.  It makes full use of the surround channels and actually makes watching the movie bearable.  The mix is wonderful and very well balanced.

Supplements include a couple commentaries which I turned off after a few minutes and a 22 minute promo video.

This disc is one of those examples of a movie that is just ok and you probably wouldn't buy under normal circumstances, but it just looks and sounds so good you just have to buy it to show off what HD DVD can do.

1758345,3,B00006HBUA,"I have a confession to make.  I didn't grow up watching cartoons.  As a result, I've only seen a handful of episodes of this show in my entire life.  Yet, I was curious about the live action version, so I finally sat down and watched it.

The Mystery Inc. Gang is in the middle of another exciting case.  Yet when they've captured the ghost, something strange happens.  A microphone is trust into Fred's face (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and suddenly the gang starts fighting.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred taking all the credit.  And Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is absolutely sick of always being the damsel in distress.  Only Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby-Doo are interested in staying together.  And so the gang breaks up.

Some time later, they are brought back together by Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson).  He owns Spooky Island, a hip college resort.  Unfortunately, his guests are arriving as normal college students and leaving as zombies.  Will the Mystery Inc. Gang be able to reconcile to solve the case?

The problem with taking a half hour program and making it a full length movie is the added time.  The writers tried to deal with that my adding the conflict within the group.  However, so little time is spent on it that it feels like an after thought.  Instead, the movie spends most of its time focusing on the story, which makes sense for the most part.  There's a twist at the end that I thought was just plain weird, but maybe that's just me.  Matthew Lillard is the standout member of the cast.  His Shaggy perfectly brought the cartoon character to life.  And the computer animated Scooby, while looking like a cartoon was believable.

There are some parts that might frighten small children, but most will be ok with it.  It's a mixed bag, at least for this non-fan of the series.",1171065600,,1817,4.695238095238095

Scooby Doo is a really fantastic movie.  I don't feel bad at all for liking it.  I'm a 25 year old man and I think it's the best family movie money can buy.

I simply loved the idea of having an animated Scooby Doo living in a world of real people.  That's what this movie is- Shaggy, Daphne and everyone else can't really SEE Scooby because Scooby isn't real.  It's the main reason the movie is so special, for goodness sake.  You simply couldn't have it any other way.  Do you think throwing in a real dog would work?  No, it wouldn't, unless you found a real dog who can talk (and don't try convincing me one of those ""I love you"" dogs are really talking because you know darn well those are the *only* words they can say).

I believe the movie was intended for EVERYONE.  The picture is pleasing on the eyes, and the plot moves forward like a typical Scooby Doo mystery from the cartoon series.  I really don't understand the problem people have with this movie.  It's understandable if you're not a fan of Scooby Doo in the first place, but if you are, the film is exactly what you'd expect.

1758347,1,B00006HBUA,"I wasn't going to watch this period, but tonight on the ABC Family Channel this was on, so I'm like o.k. let's see why I wasn't up to watching this. I got my answer rather quickly. Mind you it was a clever attempt to show that it wasn't all cartoon pie in the sky. It starts with the Mystery Machine group Velma, Fred, Shaggy, Daphnie, and Scooby all going thier separate ways as a t.v. show wanting to be cancelled. It also showed that the five all had thier personal isssues with each other, and decide it's for the best to just go thier own ways. They are all brought back together by an anonymous person to solve the mystery on Spooky Island. I found Spooky Island to be a pathetc cross between Adventureland, and Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World. This is where the clever attempt starts to unravel as you see the group trying to solve the mystery, and along the way they pick up Scrappy Doo, and depending on your sense of humor this may be funny as Daphnie gets upset with Scrappy Doo because he peed on her, but to me the line Fred uses about Scrappy marking his territory on Daphnie was without a doubt a feeble attempt to rescue this movie from absolute ruin. The special effects were also out of place here for this being a cartoon for kids up to 8-9 years old to have special effects that are more geared at an older audience was improper. I think I know as to why the group Sugar Ray ended up killing thier careers as they performed in this movie, and then the group ends up turning into monsters. It would go even further to where Fred, Velma, and Daphnie all turn into monsters as well. I couldn't go further as the movie was just that bad. I found the fact that Shaggy actually fell in love with a girl as the closest thing positive that I could find about this movie, but I feel that he should date Velma though because she's more about sense, and would be the close friend that Shaggy needs that doesn't walk on all fours. You got me I watched it, and now that I have I can say without a shadow of a doubt ""IT SUCKS"".",1158969600,6,2038,4.228205128205128
1758348,4,B00006HBUA,"I had heard so many negative things about this movie that it took me a long time to gain the courage to watch it. I am glad I did. While Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar appear initially miscast as Fred Jones and Daphne Blake, by the end of the movie you can sort of see them as those characters. The real winners here are Matthew Lillard in his best role ever as Shaggy and a digital Scooby-Doo.

The beginning of the movie finds the team of ghost hunters split up due principally due to the personalities of Daphne and Fred. Scooby and Shaggy are, as usual, interested in food, surfing, and food, remaining true to themselves. The owner of an island amusement park invites all of them, separately, to the island to help solve a mystery. After the not-quite-together team realizes there is a real mystery, the five some slowly grow together into the best team they have ever been.

The plot of movie is relatively unimportant. We have seen plots similar to these in dozens of animated Scooby Doo cartoons. We loved them. You will recognize the essence of those plots in this movie.

I was initially uncomfortable with how Daphne and Fred were played. I was expecting both characters to act more as they were in the cartoons. However, as the movie progressed I saw the method to the director's madness. While I am unable to say I was thrilled by what I saw as a significant deviation from the cartoon characters, I tried not to get hung up on it. I suppose I should have been uncomfortable with Scrappy Doo whizzing on Daphne, but I was never a big fan of Scrappy anyway.

I have yet to mention much about Linda Cardellini as Velma. After Matthew Lillard's Shaggy, Linda's Velma was the next best portrayal of the Mystery, Inc., team. Just as Matthew Lillard was Shaggy, Linda Cardellini was Velma. Interestingly, Velma, always played as the brainy, somewhat geeky, type, is the same here, yet Linda Cardellini somehow brings a beauty to Velma that was never in the animated shorts.

The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard. I have seen him in so many movies, including others with Freddie Prinze, Jr., and while his characters were often done well, he is outstanding as Shaggy. I think the true star of this film is Matthew Lillard, followed by the digital Scooby. Every time I watched Matthew, it was as though Shaggy had come to life. Matthew talked like Shaggy, walked like Shaggy, he even LOOKED like Shaggy. He was perfect. Matthew and his best friend Scooby were cartoons come to life.

Without Shaggy, Scooby and Velma, this movie would have been a disaster, perhaps not even making two stars. The three of them save the day and create the real humor and chemistry of the live version of the Mystery, Inc., team.",1156896000,2,2750,4.613496932515337
1758349,1,B00006HBUA,"Loud, obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon.

After watching this film I realized that the legendary 80's mega-flop ""Howard the Duck"" was almost twenty years ahead of its time. There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered ""sequel worthy"". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.

If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you! Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of the Scooby-Doo character, but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back!

The sequel deserves the exact same review.

Like Star Wars I, this movie packs plenty of action and stuff to look at, with almost zero chemistry or humor (except for you adult aficionados of fart jokes, you know who you are). Unlike SW1, the graphics here are pretty terrible.

To be fair, Lillard (Shaggy) is great and Cardellini (Velma) has the voice down pat and is oh-so-easy on the eyes. But that's not going to be enough to make me watch this again",1123372800,4,633,4.302521008403361
1758354,4,B00006HBUA,"A show like ""Scooby-Doo"" could only have originated in the 1960s. After all, who would buy a preppy ascot-wearing All-American boy hanging out with a brainy chick (outside of school finals), not to mention an obvious stoner and his Great Dane (Daphne was another story) to solve mysteries?

Of course, some network executive may think they've finally found the perfect show to follow FRIENDS on Must See TV so perhaps we should just move on?

With the success of live-action movies of popular cartoons such as ... ""The Flinstones"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (hmmn, there really hasn't been a successful cartoon movie translation, has there?) it was only a matter of time before one of the most beloved cartoon characters got the big screen treatment.

The whole Mystery Inc. gang is here: Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr. who will no doubt get the last laugh on those ""Spider-Man"" directors for casting Tobey Maguire in the lead role instead) Daphne (Sarah Michelle Geller), Velma (Linda Cardelini), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and of course, Scooby-Doo.

Just like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Scooby is completely computer generated, which allows him to be just as animated as he is in the cartoons.

Since the original source material wasn't exactly ""CSI"" or even ""Murder She Wrote,"" the screenwriters had to create a little drama and tension to make the big screen adaptation last a little longer than the typical 30-minute episode.

A clash of egos leads Mystery Inc. to disband (Scooby sticks with his best-bud Shaggy since Velma may have been a whiz with mysteries but she was no great shakes in the kitchen) and for the next two years, enjoy life on their own.

The gang reunites at the bequest of millionaire Mondavarious (Mr. Bean's Rowan Atkinson), the owner of Spooky Island, a spring getaway for college students. Apparently someone is turning the kids into well-behaved members of society via a mass brainwashing. Well, one thing is for sure. It's not affiliated with MTV in any way.

The gang decides to work together one more time to get to the bottom of the mystery, but they all want to be the first one to crack the mystery while Shaggy and Scooby are simply interested in the all-you-can eat buffet promised by Mondavarious.

Call me a risk taker, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and put my money on Velma.

Shaggy meets a girl (Isla Fisher) named Mary Jane - think about it for a second - who seems to be the ideal girl except for one thing ... she's allergic to dogs. And once again Mary Jane comes between yet another perfect partnership... but can Shaggy and the rest of Mystery Inc. get their act together in time to find the real culprit behind the crime?

The film has everything that Scooby fans young or old have come to love over the years from Shaggy and Scooby's rather unique eating habits to Daphne's penchant for always getting caught by the villain.

There's even a hilarious cameo appearance by Scrappy Doo, Scooby's scene-stealing mutt who thought he could take on every villain the gang encountered.

Fans of the cartoon will eat this up like a fresh batch of Scooby-snacks. Sorry, I'm trying to get a quote worked into the film's next run of commercials. It's a fun little film to enjoy some overpriced popcorn and hot dogs just promise you won't wince when you hear that famous line ""And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.""",1123113600,3,3397,4.727580372250423
1758355,3,B00006HBUA,"This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed.  You walk into this film with a level of expectancy.  You want to see the same characters, stories, and clichd moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do.  The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clichd moments are there in full force.  Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film.  As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon.  It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film.  There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player.  Yet, I was expecting this.  So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect.  Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.

To begin, the actors.  I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well.  Here we have some ""C"" level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time.  It just seemed a bit jumbled to me.  Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner.  Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me.  He should have been used so much more to his potential.  He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.

Outside of the acting, there isn't much else going on.  Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons.  Not much originality was brought into this film, while it felt like the money that should have gone to the creative department, was spent instead on sub-par CGI.  Scooby looked horrible.  I believe there was one instance where I could literally see right through him.  Then, you have these un-storied creatures that look like Donnie Darko's rejects.  Coupled with an annoying Scrappy-Doo.  There was potential in the CGI, but it seemed as if they low-balled and went with cheap CGI to appease the smaller child audiences.  The jokes needed to be planted deeper into the series.  I remember watching The Brady Bunch movie and laughing because the jokes just seemed to play off the taboo of the series.  I believe more focus on this with the Scooby-Doo movie would have raised this review another notch.

Overall, I felt cheap after watching this film.  It wasn't a horrible film (though there was quite a bit of poor graphics and acting) because it gave you what you wanted when you walked in.  It gave you a mystery, the clichd and overused structure of the original series, and that final moment when the true villain is revealed.  It followed a structure that I wanted, and I am ""ok"" with that for this film.  Normally, I would have asked for better, but there are some cartoons that do not need their internal structure tampered with.  Scooby-Doo was worth the one viewing, but I cannot say that I will ever be pleased to see it again.  The fact that there was the horrendous farting contest in the center of the film destroyed the entire experience for me.  That was the kind of humor I was not prepared for, nor did I feel it best represented the series.  The Mark McGrath cameo also did it in for me, but that my friend ... well ... is another story.  If you have never seen this film I suggest it once, but I do not feel that it needs a second viewing.  Scooby-Doo is alive, but in an animated version that continues to create laughter and creativity ... unlike this shoddy film.

My interest in this is based on Sarah Michelle Gellar. I've enjoyed everything she's done so far. This was better than scooby-doo2, but then sequels seldom live up to the original.

It has a PG rating which invalidates those ratings talking about how it will scare small children. And restates the obvious that this is NOT a movie for children.

This wasn't written for small children. It's in the same category as the word 'Campy'. It has subtle innuendo, and is aimed at the teen market and older.

1758427,3,B00006HBUA,"""Scooby-Doo"" is okay.  It's not that great of a film and it's not that bad.  As much as I despise him, I have to say that Matthew Lillard does an excellent job as Shaggy.  He's the best character in this flick.  Linda Cardellini is good as Velma, but she has a couple of lines(ex. ""Let's get jinky with it"") that are just atrocious.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. wasn't necessarily miscast as Fred, but the character was portrayed in a way that doesn't really reflect the character from the original show.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was annoying as Daphne.  Nevermind the fact that she pulled out the old kung-fu ala ""Buffy,"" she's just not convincing enough in this role.  The CGI Scooby was just that, a CGI Scooby.  He looks fake, but dogs can't talk either, so I'm okay with that.  His character is actually pretty good.
The best part of this film is the opening scene with the Luna ghost.  It looked as if it were straight out of the old series.  Everything heads south from there.  The characters, excepting Shaggy and Scooby, are weightless.  The nasties are just plain silly and the jokes resort to sophomoric humor.  I'm sure every thirteen year-old boy in the crowd got a laugh from the farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby.  A few cuss words were thrown around, and Daphne puts a whipping on a wrestler-type baddie.
Overall, this film works well with kids between the ages of eleven and sixteen.  Younger kids MIGHT get scared by the bad guys, and the language can get a little rough for the really young'uns.  For us older folks who grew up with the series, it's nice to see Scooby and the gang in a live-action format.  However, I feel that this movie tries too hard to make itself appeal to all age groups.  I also think that the director should have decided on whether he was making a nostalgic flick, a spoof, or an updated version using potty humor.
It's watchable and somewhat funny, but you might want to rent this one before laying any money down for it.",1089158400,4,1966,4.53125
1758428,4,B00006HBUA,"After a classic Scooby Doo mystery being solved, Velma gets tired of Fred always taking the credit for her work and quits the gang. Fred and Daphne follow suite and the now lonely duo of Shaggy and Scooby go off on their own.
About a year or so later, they meet up again at the airport where, unbeknownst to them, they are all invited to the newly opened Spooky Island theme park to solve a mystery. Each person vows to solve the mystery on their own, but once they get to their destination, they realize that they must work together once again to solve the mystery of what is changing the vacationing college students from normal teenagers into zombie type strangers.
Shaggy meets a girl who becomes a sort of love interest and sort of casts Scooby off for his new interest. When Scooby realizes there is more to Shaggy's new friend than meets the eye, Shaggy refuses to listen and causes Scooby to become a willing, but unknown participant in the evil doer's plan to take over the world.
Loaded with great special effects, computer animation and a great cameo starring the puppy everyone loves to hate, Scrappy Doo, this movie is great. The characters all kept the same aspects that made the cartoon great. However, there are some things that kept me from giving this movie 5 stars. In the cartoon, Velma never seemed resentful of Fred always taking the credit, Daphne was more than a spoiled selfish brat, Fred did not act stupid even in the least.

1758429,2,B00006HBUA,"First of all, my apologies, as this review is based entirely on my personal hopes of what this movie was going to deliver. Other viewers may have found lots of their expectations realised on the screen, but sadly, mine weren't.
The makers of the Scooby Doo movie didn't really have to get a lot of things right to make this film a real laugh, yet they managed to do everything wrong. I was really looking forward to seeing my favourite cartoon come to life, but they messed up on all the basic rules of this classic show. First off, the main characters all only have one set of clothes, but the costume designers for the film couldn't even stick to the simple designs of the cartoon, instead they went for hopeless approximations that just look ill-fitting and careless. Worst offender is Daphne, done up in all sorts of lurid fashions and hairdos, looking nothing like the animated original. Same goes for poor Velma with that odd long lanky brown wig and shapeless sweater. Even Fred had several changes of costume and the wrong hairdo. Only Shaggy came across as the real deal, which is probably more of a tribute to Matthew Lillard's dedication rather than the designers.
Next rule: There must always be a chase down a never-ending hallway with the same scenery going past over and over again. I think there were some chases in the movie, but nothing that brought this much loved (and much lampooned in the past) feature to the forefront where it should have been (Unless it was during a sequence when I dozed off).
Next rule: The monsters must be dumb and easily fooled. Most monsters in the cartoon just went ""Graaagghh!"" and swiped their arms in thin air as Scooby and co. slipped away from them just in time. The movie monsters are actually quite frightening demons that fly through the air, taking possession of innocent holidaymakers. Frightening is good, but it doesn't belong in this context.
Another thing that spoils the mood is surrounding the characters with hundreds of extras and other actors. It just shows up the implausibility of the whole gang ever passing for real people. This could have worked hilariously as a parody (a device that worked beautifully for the Brady Bunch Movie), but here it just makes the characters look thoroughly underdeveloped. They can't possibly interact with naturalistic ""real-life"" characters, only with similarly 2-dimensional ciphers like cackling crones, disgruntled sherrifs or sinister butlers.
Next up, the characterisation. Again, Matthew Lillard steals the show as Shaggy, and truly breathes life into the part. Fred and Velma are boring and under developed, but that kind of reflects the cartoon, so no big deal there, although Velma could have been given more to get her teeth into. Worst of all, again, is Daphne, demonstrated by the insertion of the blatantly inappropriate ""Daphne does martial arts"" sequence. If Sarah Michelle Gellar can't stay away from playing Buffy, she shouldn't be considered for other movies. She certainly shouldn't bring the character with her. A huge mistake. Finally, Scooby Doo himself. Considering the possible options for bringing a talking dog to life, the movie version is actually quite successful. I thought the interplay between Scooby and the human mambers of the gang worked pretty well, and his character really came through. Shame that the animators decided to give him those bizarre big, bright, human style eyes which the cartoon version never sported. Weird and a bit creepy.
As the the plot, its just far too busy. Anything and everything is thrown in making it clear that the makers could not decide what angle they were going for. They dabble in playing it true to the cartoon (very, very briefly), playing it for modern (Animal House-type) laughs, playing it as a parody, and playing it as a ""what if the characters went in this direction?"" kind of update. Too many styles, no substance and no chance for the audience to engage with any one mood. A real mess.
As I said at the start, this is only my personal disappointment. I can't tell if other moviegoers had a similar experience, and lots of people seem to have found the film to be a riot. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a serious letdown and a huge wasted opportunity. I'm now waiting to see the second one to see if any of this gets put right...I really hope it does.",1086652800,4,4339,4.825503355704698

However, I DID grow up in the 80's and 90's watching this show, so maybe I just have a different take.  Okay, so Freddy Prinze, Jr. was not the most perfect choice for Fred.  A lot of reviews resent his representation as an attention starved and fame hogging character, but I have to say that while the movie took it to the extreme, it by no means pulled it out of thin air.  And Daphne was always getting captured and lost in the spooky old dungeons and mansions, and it was normally Velma or (Duh duh duh!) good ol' Freddy to the rescue.  And the romantic connection everyone is claiming came from nowhere at the end of the movie?  Were ya'll even watching?!?  While Gellar and Prinze may only have been chosen for their star power and not for their excellent casting as the characters, they DO portray the relationship that we all know existed between Daphne and Fred rather well.  And NO ONE can tell me Velma and Shaggy weren't brilliantly casted!
The plot, while not in the ""Scooby Doo, Where are you?"" fashion, is more along the lines of ""The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby Doo"" minus Vincent Price.  The monsters are real, not masked men. And for all the Christians bashing the movie for that reason, be forewarned, if you deny the existence of evil in the world, regardless of your religion, then you open yourself to it.  Being unaware doesn't exclude.  Besides, this was a FUN, FAMILY ORIENTED movie, remember.  The occult elements were in Scooby Doo fashion, discovering new legends associated with the area in which they are investigating the mystery.
In essence, if you enjoy this movie for what it was intended to be, which was a fresh representation of fantastic characters, which remains true to the ideas implied in the series, as well as a fun film, then you'll get the point.  If not, then ""Zoinks"" you take things way too seriously.",1082332800,,1990,4.53781512605042

I know this film was not for the usual conservative viewers but filmmakers should keep women in mind when they make comedies. Women do not find flatulence the least bit funny.

1758448,4,B00006HBUA,"I was seriously dreading this film. What was conceivably a very, very bad idea turned out to be a surprisingly good film with a fair amount of comedy. Originally a Mike Myers vehicle (thank God THAT didn't work out), but then recast with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream actors, the realization of Scooby-Doo as a CGI character interacting with live action actually works. I'd say it was a one in a million chance but Raja Gosnell managed to pull it off.

The most impressive transformation tho is not cartoon Scooby to CGI Scooby but Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy. No way would I have believed he could possibly take on the role of one of my most fave characters ever but he just seems to completely disappear and the spirit of Shaggy takes him over. He brings some real integrity to what is widely regarded as an artless family movie. Even Freddy Prinze Jr. seems to nail the voice and narcissism of Fred, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is quite good as Daphne. Though I was always more attracted to Velma as I really dig nerdy chicks. Linda Cardellini brings some true sex appeal to the role. I wish the never-seen lesbian kiss between her and Daphne never got cut out.

Of course the plot is the usual baloney but there is constant action and invention to keep even the most impatient viewer stuck on till the end. The gang go to a theme park resort called Spooky Island (actually an Australian resort) to solve the mystery of why the wild spring break kids are turning into well-mannered nerds. But not only are there guys in masks but there are some REAL spooks too. I would have liked Rowan Atkinson to have a bigger role as Emile Mondavarious but considering the twist (which comes as an amusing surprise) at the end, the plot doesn't really have room for it. It's good to have him in there though instead of a cast full of 20-somethings. But 99% of the comic genius comes Matthew Lillard.

The CGI has dated somewhat since its release. Scooby and the various demons don't look very photo-realistic anymore and it's a little bit distracting. I doubt the target audience will care.

Yes, the plot is classic Scooby, with its hauntings arranged by villains - and hints of real ghosts.

IT'S A DISGRACE, IT SIMPLY RUINS WITH SCOOBY DOO'S GOOD NAME!

Worst: there are not a single funny joke in the whole movie (except the end, that reminds me ""Scooby Doo on Zombie Island""), the story is a disgrace, far from the interesting misteries Scooby and the guys always solved on the cartoons. And to disgrace even more: Scrappy Doo are the main bad guy!!! WHAT'S THIS?? IT ONLY CAN BE A VERY BAD JOKE! THAT'S NOT THE SCOOBY DOO'S REALITY, IT'S ALL WRONG!!!

Now they are trying to disgrace the Scooby Doo's name a second time, so I wanna give my previous advice for people: DON'T GO TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH SCOOBY DOO 2, FORGET ABOUT, IF YOU RESPECT THE SCOOBY'S LEGACY! WAIT WHEN, REAL ARTISTS, WHO CARES ABOUT THE RIGHT THINGS, GET A GOOD STORY AND MAKE A DECENT SCOOBY DOO MOVIE, NOT THIS TRASH. At least, this movie is useful for just three things:
1) To illustrate perfectly what NOT to do in a future Scooby Doo adaptation;
2) To show how NOT TO DO an adaptation of a TV cartoon, or any other adaptation;
3) To reinforce the idea that Scooby Doo are a FAMILY'S CARTOON and it have to remain like this, without this tragic and scatologic adaptation for disturbed teens.

1758453,3,B00006HBUA,"Well, ""Soitenly""!!!!! I mean, Jinkies, this IS the Scoobster, even if he is a little physically altered by his CGI conversion to pseudo-reality.
But, is it any good? Well, actually, yes it is. Could have been BETTER, I think, but it was passable enough...and enjoyable enough...as lightweight entertainment. Better than that if you evaluate it solely as a ""kiddie"" movie.
If you want to analyze it as ""Cinema"", it has to get mixed reviews. It was only partially well-cast. Matthew Lillard as Shaggy OWNS the show. He IS the shagster. All the body language, the vocal nuances, the facial expressions, the ""eye language"", it is all there. If anybody else could top Lillard as the definitive Shaggy, I'd be interested to hear who it could be. And Linda Cardellini as Velma was also an inspired choice. Could have been that Christina Ricci might have done equally well, but who is to say? The Cardellini performance is fine with me.
I am mixed in my feelings about Sarah Michelle Gellar's Daphne. She plays this a lot more neurotically and with a lot more of a chip on her shoulder than any  recollected visions I have of the basically good hearted ol' ""Daph"". And one just KNEW, going in, that the producers would work to play to Gellar's ""Buffy"" persona at some point, and sure enough, they did (Tho' I admit, I liked the ... kicking she dished out to Scrappy's masked wrestle-mania henchman, and the subsequent disruption of the little creep's plans that flowed from it).
Freddie Prinz's Fred Jones just doesn't hit it with me, though. His is the one characterization I can't buy into here. He is just totally miscast. He doesn't look good as a blonde, he doesn't look like the cartoon Fred Jones, and his runaway conceit is a bit too over the top.
The dog also doesn't look totally like the cartoon Scooby, but then, SO WHAT? Big whiff. Nobody else looks identical to THEIR cartoon counterparts either.

 The sequential presentation is a little skewed, with the best sequences coming right at the beginning (The Luna Ghost), but all in all this is fun hokum that mostly works( the ""paging Mr. Doo"" sequence is a hoot). I paid for a ticket to see it in the theatre and then shelled out for the DVD. As tight as I am reputed to be, I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't liked the overall effort.
  If one is a long-term ""Scoobster"" fan, though, there is one single scene in this movie that makes any & all of its faults totally irrelevant.  A to-die-for moment that many people have waited YEARS just HOPING to see. And director Rajah Gosnell gives it to you. FINALLY! What is it? Oh, Come onnnnnnnn! How can you ASK???
It's when Scooby , at long last, BUSTS SCRAPPY'S CHOPS!!! Makes you want to STAND UP AND CHEER!!!!!
  Now if these folks at WB/Cartoon Network want to continue on down the sequel road (and Scooby II is about wrapped, I understand), then I would suggest the following to them; take a cue from the old ""Scooby Doo Movies"" guest-star format (no, I don't mean Pam Anderson!) and cut a distribution deal with Universal. Then go Computer Graphic Imagery crazy and send the gang to Universal's famed, fictional east European monster world (No, not Transylvania)...Vasaria. And by means of CGI hook them up with a Bela Lugosi Dracula, a Boris Karloff Frankenstein Monster, A Chaney, Jr., Wolfman, a Dwight Frye Renfield, and a Lugosi (again) Igor. Add Abbott & Costello to the mix....AND Cassandra Peterson as Elvira and Darren McGavin (""younged up"" via CGI like Anthony Hopkins in ""Red Dragon"") as
Karl Kolchak. Add ""The Monster Mash"" to the proceedings and GO WITH THE FLOW!
  Oh, yes...one more thing, Warner Brothers (and Dot). In future let's use the straight-up version of the original theme song a little more in the credits, how about? I'm not saying don't use more contemporary stuff here and there, but...hey...lets always give a nod to the original vision when we can. Deal?",1068768000,4,3895,4.697947214076247

I think that just about any person on the planet who saw the old Scooby cartoons when they were still actually broadcast on television should see this movie, but try not to get too worked up about it because....
There is almost no attention paid to the power of the old Scooby ""franchise"".  Old fans will not quite recognize what they liked so much about the cartoon, new fans will not be able to make the connection to what the old fans were raving about in the first place, etc.
No attempt was made to exploit any of the ""subversive"" subtext of the cartoon (i.e., that Shaggy is always hungry because he's something of a pothead and has the munchies on a regular basis).  There was ample opportunity to dress everyone in this movie in the dreckiest 70's outfits imaginable, which would have been kind of funny.  My guess is that Daphne/Buffy said ""no way, I'm not wearing that thing"".  Daphne/Buffy also got her boyfriend onto the set (news flash...Freddie Prinz, Jr. is not convincing as a blond).  It turns out she's responsible for more evil-doing than the vampires give her credit for.
Scooby is not an exact duplicate of the cartoon character, even though he is a cartoon.  Scooby's eyes are too big (and too black...maybe Scoob is the one with the recreational drug problem).  Something there is about a live-action film that does not love a cartoon.  Maybe there was a test run performed with a ""small-eyed"" computer-generated Scooby, and it just didn't look right.  But when millions of people know exactly what Scooby did look like, messing with the formula may not always be the wisest move.
But anyhow, it's worth seeing just to be able to talk about it later.  The ""protoplasmic heads"" are also cool.",1065225600,2,1826,4.692789968652038

The main problem is that it's not funny.  Not even close.  My wife and I kept asking each other, ""Was that supposed to be funny?""  even though we knew the answer...No.  The plodding plot exists to allow the cardboard characters to go through their paces and to give the animators a chance to create the bumbling, larger-than-life Scooby-Doo.  But this movie chases its tail, unsure what kind of beast it is:  a mindless spoof, a monster flick, or a genuine mystery.  Ultimately, and unfortunately, it settles on being an undesignated mess.

1758478,5,B00006HBUA,"Generally I think this is an awesome movie in any way, as well as it's DVD. In fact before seeing this movie I hadn't watched any Scooby cartoons yet, at least I don't remember I had. So now I'm writing my review on the movie itself, not on the comparision between the movie and it's cartoon version, which I think is not really that necessary. And I'd have to say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen these years. I've watched the DVD over and over again, probably more than five times and sometimes with the commentary on. And I just couldn't put it down! First of all, The storyline is smooth and easy to get into. There's not a moment I don't enjoy. Everything in this movie look bright and colorful, so do the characters. Second, the four actors who play the four main characters in the movie sure did a good job. They bring out every character's personalities and everything through their acting. And it's almost obvious at the beginng of the movie, so it's very easy to figure out their relationship and what kind of people they are like even though you're people like me who aren't familiar with scooby-doo. Also, the interaction and conflicts between these people make this movie even more funny and interesting, Personally Scooby-Doo and Velma are my favortie characters, and I think they did very well on the movie version of Scooby. He looks kind of like a real dog instead of cartoon version, but at the same he is so funny, active and full of emotions. There're one or two scenes of his eyes watering. To me that is just so moving! At this point I almost forgot that he is created with computer animation! Finally, the ending is quite encourging and satisfying. It leaves me wonderful memories after the movie ends. By the way, this is one of the well-done DVDs too. It includes great special features such as cast and director's commentaries, they did help me understand the movie better. All in all, I think this movie is definitely worth seeing and the DVD is unquestionably a must own!!",1061510400,2,2013,4.548209366391185
1758479,4,B00006HBUA,"I had heard so many negative things about this movie that it took me a long time to gain the courage to watch it.  I'm glad I did.  While Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar appear initially miscast as Fred Jones, and Daphne Blake, by the end of the movie you can sort of see it.  The real winners here are Matthew Lillard in his best role ever as Shaggy and a digital Scooby-Doo.
The beginning of the movie find the team of ghost hunters split up due principally to the personalities of Daphne and Fred.  Scooby and Shaggy are, as usual, interested in food, surfing, and food, remaining true to themselves.  The owner of an island amusement park invites all of them, separately, to the island to help solve a mystery.  After the not-quite-together team realizes there is a real mystery, the five some slowly grow together into the best team they have ever been.
The plot of movie is relatively unimportant.  We have seen plots similar to these in dozens of animated Scooby Doo cartoons.  We loved them.  You will recognize the essence of those plots in this movie.
I was initially uncomfortable with how Daphne and Fred were played.  I was expecting both characters to act more as they were in the cartoons.  However, as the movie progressed I saw the method to the director's madness, and while I can't say I was ever thrilled by what I saw as a significant deviation from the cartoon characters, I tried not to get hung up on it.  I supposed I should have been uncomfortable with Scrappy Doo whizzing on Daphne, but I was never a big fan of Scrappy anyway.
I have yet to mention very little about Linda Cardellini as Velma.  After Matthew Lillard's Shaggy, Linda's Velma was the next best portrayal of the Mystery, Inc., team.  Just as Matthew Lillard was Shaggy, Linda Cardellini was Velma.  Interestingly, Velma, always played as the brainy, somewhat geeky, type, is the same here, yet Linda Cardellini somehow brings a beauty to Velma that was never in the animated shorts.
The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard.  I have seen him in so many movies, including others with Freddie Prinze, Jr., and while his characters were often done well, he is outstanding as Shaggy.  I think the true star of this film is Matthew Lillard, followed by the digital Scooby.  Every time I watched Matthew, it was as though Shaggy had come to life.  Matthew talked like Shaggy, walked like Shaggy, he even LOOKED like Shaggy.  He was perfect.  Matthew and his best friend Scooby were cartoons come to life.
Without Shaggy, Scooby and Velma, this movie would have been a disaster, perhaps not even making two stars.  The three of them save the day and create the real humor and chemistry of the live version of the Mystery, Inc., team.",1060992000,2,2749,4.624742268041237

Contaning performances capable of moving you to tears, you'll have to watch it again and again. The exact opposite of all that is true of this film. It makes Darkness Falls look like Goodfellas. It contains almost two hours of pure torture. While watching this movie you can actually feel your brain slowly being eaten away. If you watched it enough times your brain would rot down to nothing and then maybe you could tolerate this thing. It is not a movie or film. It is a horrible parrasite. A journey into hell.

Shaggy and Scooby were great, and the computer generation of a 3D Scooby was pretty good.  But the entire story of soul-sucking aliens was really stupid.  And the worse scene of this movie (among many) was the one where Freddie transmigrated his soul into Daphne's body and got lustful thinking he could look at ""herself"" naked.  So grotesque.  And what did they do to Scrappy?  I always loved Scrappy and how he would boss Unca Scooby around.  They made Scrappy into a ... creep.  Definitely no good.

1758483,2,B00006HBUA,"Scooby-Doo is mercifully short - at only 83 minutes - which is probably the best thing that can be said about it.  Whatever the director and producers were trying to achieve by bringing Hanna-Barbera's classic cartoon to life, it's fairly safe to say they failed.  Despite excellent character interpretations by Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini as Shaggy and Velma, the fleshing out of the Mystery Inc. team is disappointingly shallow.  As is the irritating mission of self-discovery and angst each character goes through before discovering that (surprise, surprise) teamwork is best.
The film could be forgiven many of its foibles if only it was rib-ticklingly hilarious.  Unfortunately it suffers from trying to cater both to a young audience, and also to adults who fondly remember the cartoon from their childhood days.  Rowan Atkinson is cringingly unfunny as the strange proprietor of Spooky Island amusement park, and surely even kids are by now impervious to fart and snot jokes.  However, the sequence inside the spooky abandoned castle raises a few hearty chuckles.
The trademark unlikeliness of the situations Mystery Inc. got themselves into in the cartoon doesn't transfer well into realism.  The plot, which has a number of large holes, concerns the mysterious change in behaviour of college students who are holidaying at the resort of Spooky Island.  And, it has to be admitted, that thanks to some great sets and the wonders of CGI, the resort looks like a pretty cool place to spend a vacation.  The construction of the theme park has awakened some ancient (and quite scary, considering the PG-rating) monsters, so it's up to the team to unmask the villain and save the world.

I was actually surprised by the villian, and it was a perfect choice. (I'm not easily surprised, I figured out the Sixth Sense in the first 10 minutes)

When I heard a few years ago that they were planning on making a live action film, I was excited. Then I heard that Sarah Michelle Gellar had been cast as Daphne and Freddie Prince, Jr. had been cast as Fred. I almost choked. I knew then that this movie was doomed from the start. And boy was it ever.

Most of the casting was terrible. The story is garbage. Though this is marketed as a family film, SCOOBY-DOO is anything but family fare. The plot revolves around soul sucking monsters bent on taking over the world. The setting for this delightful concept is a horror theme park, including rides where a person could literally lose their head. The film is neither a parody nor remake of the original cartoon series and therefore it seriously flounders. Had it been a parody (ala THE BRADY BUNCH), it could have worked. Had it been a remake (ala THE ADDAMS FAMILY) it would probably have worked. However, the film does neither and totally strays from the spirit of the series.

In fact, the movie has only one thing going for it: Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. It's either a tribute to his talent or a statement about how bad SCOOBY-DOO is, but Lillard gives one of the finest comic performances of the year. His portrayal of Shaggy is flawless and is the only reason to watch this film.

The only bright spots are the dead-on performances of the 'animated' Scooby and Scrappy Doo and Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy.  (Did I just say ""portrayal of Shaggy? Jeez...)

The original SD stuff was about being scared and solving a mystery.  This stinker of a film tries to cash-in on the retro-feel of the characters and make this into some Austin Powers wanna-be.  This movie is never scary and it actually is never funny either.
By making the monsters real, the whole fun and innocence of the original series is lost.  The original characters were debunkers, not super-heroes on a journey of self-discovery.
The film comes across as mindless as a ""Gilligan's Island"" episode but not nearly as fun.
They don't even get the jargon right -- it's the ""Mystery Machine"" not the ""Mystery Van.""
Again, it could have been fun and even a little scary, but this production is too interested in FX and being retro.  It just doesn't work.
Perhaps if they had made a more gothic haunted house mystery, like the trailer and the animated opening sequence suggested, it would have worked better and been truer to audience expectations.

Who but Gosnell could have translated into live-action the existential miasma that permeated the original cartoons like an inky cloak, a cloak that invariably contained Mr. McGumbly underneath many layers of hideous disguises, like a ghoulish matryoshka doll?
Mr. Gosnell must be part Dane himself to convey with such unerring poignancy the deeply lachrymose yet pulchritudinous serial existence of Scooby, an existence bound in the tiny nutshell of the Mystery Machine and the stagnation of comic foils such as Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne, with the sometime, though never often enough, appearance of that intrepid eyas Scrappy-Doo.  A small measure of the director's faithfulness to the spirit of Scooby, that melancholy Dane, may be glimpsed in his most famous of soliloquies, ""Rroo rree orr rrot rroo rree, rrat rriz rrruh rrreschun.""  Unfortunately, however, the printed word cannot convey the power of his words, nor can they overcome the limitations of his doggy vocal chords.

""To be or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to beg
For the heroin-like goodness of Scooby-snacks,
Or earn them despite a sea of troubles,
And by staying eat them?  To crunch:  to munch;
Oh more!  And then I say good-bye to all
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a doggie treat
Devoutly to be wish'd.  To crunch, to munch;
To munch, perhaps to float: ay there's the high;
For in that sleepy death what creepiness comes
When we have gone into our happy place
Must give us pause:  there's the respect
That makes calamity of this delight;
For who would bear the ghouls and ghosts,
The really scary monster, the haunted house,
The pangs of hunger, breakfast and lunch delayed,
The insolence of Fred and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself his Scooby-snacks could take,
With a bare bodkin?  Who would Velma bear,
Who loses her stupid glasses all the time,
But that the opiate that is the Scooby-snack,
The chemical delight whose recipe
Is known to only Shaggy, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others we know not of?
Thus Scooby-snacks make addicts of us all;
And thus the native of hue of healthful life,
Is sicklied o'er with delirium tremors,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their current turn awry,
And lose the name of action.""",1047945600,4,2736,4.812366737739872

It makes ""Batman and Robin"" look like ""Seven Samurai"", it makes ""The Flintstones"" look like a documentary. This movie is nowhere true to the old cartoon and is closest to the ""13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo"" which would be a horrible thing to base a movie on.

That theory is spit on and then thrown out the door in this movie. Who is this movie aimed at? Its ""humor"" is so infantile that only 3 year olds who haven't outgrown fart jokes will laugh, but yet there are poorly veiled drug references and gratuitous cheesecake material with Daphne and Velma. Which leads us to extreme miscasting on the part of Fred and Daphne. Lillard and Cardellini did very accurate voices and mannerisms of Shaggy and Velma, but I wonder if Freddie Prinze Jr. and SMG have ever even seen Scooby-Doo. Oh wait, they just have the combined acting talent of an old boot and were only cast because they're hizzot.

Do not subject yourselves or anyone else to this piece of dreck. Parents, if you need something to babysit your kids with, get something good like Mary Poppins or Spy Kids.

As for Scooby himself I was relatively unimpressed with the CGI canine and I am not at all surprised that Mike Myers decided not to pursue this project. This is a movie with no redeeming qualities and with a sequel planned I'd have to recommend that instead of Scooby Doo, you Scooby don't.",1045699200,20,1042,4.432291666666667
1758520,1,B00006HBUA,"This movie was a terrible remake of a masterful cartoon series.
The only character i actually liked in this movie was scooby-doo. The rest of the cast were awful. The cartoon series were made 30 years ago and they had a whole lot better script than this movie. Avoid it!",1045699200,3,270,4.42
1758521,5,B00006HBUA,"""Scooby-Doo"" is the live-action film version based on the original hit cartoon series, ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"". Directed by Raja Gosnell, it is fun and has the same spirit as the TV series did, while in 3-D.
PLOT SUMMARY: In the opening of the film version of ""Scooby-Doo"", the Scooby gang are in the middle of solving a mystery. They have become very famous, but when Velma (Linda Cardellini) thinks everything is too formulatic, she decides to quite. The self-proclaimed leader and concited Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) as well as Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) also quite, leaving Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby behind with the Mystery van. Two years later, all five of them receive mysterious invitations to an amusement park for college students called Spooky Island. At the airport, they discover that all of them have received the invitations and reluclantly decide to go. On the plane, Shaggy meets Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) and falls in love with her. It's ironic how she's allergic to dogs. When they get to Spooky Island, they meet the strange theme park owner, Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) who claims that something has gone terribly wrong in his theme park: the students who come to the park, arrive as their normal, wild and crazy selves. But when they leave, they are super-serious students, who act almost like zombies. Now, it's up to the Mystery Inc. gang to solve the mystery before it destroys all of humanity.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I must say how surprised I am by liking the film. I guess it's because I loved the TV show. The acting performances are probably the best part about the film--watching these young, talented actors like Gellar, Cardellini, Prinze Jr., and especially Lillard, transform into the cartoon characters who everybody loves. But Lillard steals the show--he manages to capture Shaggy's character like no other and brings him to life. I really believed that Matthew Lillard wasn't just PLAYING Shaggy, but he WAS Shaggy. The storyline is fun, light, and easy to follow. It can be scary at times for very young children, but it is mainly harmless. The directing by Raja Gosnell was amazing, and the special effects were awesome, especially the CG Scooby. It must be a challenge for actors to play alongside any CG character, but the cast of ""Scooby"" pulled it off really well. There are enough surprises to keep you interested, even though it may seem a bit predictable.
The DVD has lots of goodies which include a making of the film documentary, filmmakers' and cast's commentary options, never-before-seen footage, featurettes, a music video, ""hidden extras"", interactive computer games, and DVD-ROM extras. The DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.
I highly recommend ""Scooby-Doo"".

1758522,4,B00006HBUA,"We took our 4 and 6 year old daughters (then 3 and 5), and my wife, myself and our 2 daughters absolutely loved this movie. It was funny and enjoyable. Some of the scenes were a bit scary probably for our 3 year old, but she didn't act like it. What can you say about the whole ""showdown"" between Shaggy and Scooby with bodily function noises? I was in stitches in the theatre. It had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes!
If you're looking for an in-depth storyline, forget it. It's not there. This movie is playing homage to the old cartoons that I grew up watching UNTIL Scrappy came on board. And yet, they even play homage to that in a way I love. For all the Scrappy haters out there, we get our just revenge with what happens in this movie to him. Many people let this cloud their judgment of the movie and hate it just because of that. Well, I see that the makers of this movie agree with the rest of us: SCRAPPY STUNK! He was obnoxious, selfish and just overall irritating! He never should have existed and that his appearance was the downfall of the Scooby series.
Each character is VERY believable, especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. And, with me being a Buffy fan, I just HAD to see SMG in this movie as Daphne. She pulled it off great. As for Freddy Prinze Jr., I'm not so sure he was the BEST Fred, but he pulled it off for me, even though his Fred was different from the cartoon in many respects.
As for the DVD, the widescreen edition looks awesome. The features on the DVD are pretty good for a WB release. My kids loved listening to the commentary from the stars. The other features of the movie are pretty good as well and the DVD-ROM features are pretty cool. My 6-year-old daughter loved the games from the DVD-ROM.
The deleted scenes are pretty cool. Some, you wonder why they removed them, but if you listen to the commentary while watching them, you can understand why that was done and it makes total sense.
Now, supposedly this movie had a lot of sexual and drug references in them that were ultimately removed. I was one of the people who wanted those to be removed when I read about it in a newspaper article before the movie was released and I'm glad those aren't included here. Many people would probably cry foul that they were not included, but since my daughters know how to navigate around the DVD features, I would NOT want them to have access to them. Plus, I do not want to have to lock this DVD out with parental locks. Instead, I would want my daughters to be able to watch this when they want. So, kudos to WB for not including those scenes and for not releasing them at all in the theatres. Otherwise, I would have refused to take my daughters to it and they already knew it was coming, so that would have been a total blow to them.
Excellent movie, excellent DVD. I still watch this movie and get a laugh. The soundtrack is pretty good as well. I can't get into a lot of the rap and hiphop stuff, but some of it on the soundtrack is pretty good. I would recommend getting that as well. My daughters absolutely love the soundtrack and dance to it until they drop with exhaustion.
I would be prepared that it's PG for a reason: lewd humor (the bodily noises section) and Fred DOES utter a derogatory word about women that you hear alot from today's generation, but it actually was something I didn't catch until someone else said something about it. Since he talks in the ""lingo"" after being possessed, it's kind of hard to understand and I think for most kids, it will go over their heads. Also, Daphne talks about opening up a can of whoop, uh, mule on someone. It's too bad they couldn't have left those out.
Overall, an excellent movie. Fun and funny to watch over and over again. Did I mention I loved the bodily function duel between Shaggy and Scooby? ;)",1042675200,,3845,4.334257975034674
1758523,4,B00006HBUA,"This movie is based on the highly successful Hanna-Barbara cartoon series.  It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma.  The plot revolves around the group's mystery solving team, Mystery Inc.  The group has split up after differences among the members surfaced.  However, two years later, each receives a letter from the owner of Spooky Island, a hot spring break resort.  Apparently, some supernatural forces have been at work on the island, and the group has been summoned to see if they can help.  However, each does not know that anyone else has been invited, so its a shock when everyone arrives at the airport and discovers that they're all going to the same place.  Will everyone be able to put their differences aside and solve the mystery?
I thought the acting in the movie was pretty good overall. However, I thought Fred's character was too preppy and self-involved. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a good job as Daphnie, and Linda Cardellini makes a perfect Velma, but this movie belongs to Matthew Lillard.  His portyayal of Shaggy is top notch.  He even sounds like the old Saturday morning character that we grew up with.  His relationship with Scooby is just like I remember as a child. The computer animation is well done, and Scooby Doo seems almost life-like.  This is a fun movie and brings back a lot of childhood memories.",1042416000,2,1424,4.8429752066115705
1758541,3,B00006HBUA,"If you are looking for a movie done in the spirit of the original Scooby series, you will be mostly disappointed. This movie is full of mocking, ironic, ""hip"" self-referential humor for ""grown-ups.""
Irony was something devoid from the Scooby-Doo cartoons, it was part of what made them so endearing and long-lived in popularity. In this, it was similar to Spongebob Squarepants, a contemporary cartoon on Nickolodeon that is currently winning the hearts of children and adults. It makes one wonder if someday we'll see a Spongebob live action movie in which, for example, there is innuendo about Spongebob having substance abuse problems with Krabby Patties...
At any rate, in this movie the filmmakers have decided to mock the character of Fred by turning him into a smug narcissist. Daphne is now a helpless ditz frustrated by her own ineptness, Scooby and Shaggy are the victims of pot jokes, and Velma's high intelligence is lampooned.
The performance by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy is brilliantly performed and well-written; together with Scooby it is perhaps the one character that (other than the aforementioned pot joke) doesn't suffer from the kind of jokes at its expense that are lobbed at the others. He put a great deal of care into creating an authentic portrayal and it really shows on screen. Linda Cardellini plays an excellent Velma, but as with the other characters the script has her acting out of character for intended comedic effect. With a more faithful script she would have also been dead-on. Rowan Atkinson puts in a fine turn as the gang's client, although his small role leaves little opportunity for displaying his enormous comedic talent; it's a little like using a Ferrari to get groceries.
If you feel somewhat embarassed and self conscious about liking the old Scooby Doo cartoons, you will probably enjoy this movie with no qualms, and have a good laugh as the movie pokes fun at Freddie's clothes, etc. The filmmakers are embarassed too. For the rest of us, it is still entertaining to see the characters moving around in real life, and the relationship between Shaggy and Scooby is the one bright spot that captures something of the original fun, warmth and camaraderie in the cartoon. Otherwise, the movie leaves one feeling a little unfulfilled, like they've eaten a hollow Scooby Snack.",1042156800,,2324,4.992268041237113
1758542,1,B00006HBUA,"Just last night, my wife and I rented Scooby-Doo just for the heck of it.  We were under no delusion that it would approach the cartoon too closely.
However, we were not prepared for the seventh level of hell this movie took us on a ride for.  It should have had a warning label:  ""PARENTAL ADVISORY -- DANTE'S INFERNO ON THIS MOVIE.""
The only character worth noting, applauding, and commiserating with is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  He has the voice and most of the characterizations nailed pat.
However, Freddie Prinze Jr. is astoundingly annoying as ""Fred""...
I love Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy, but I cringe and wince to see what she has been reduced to here.  ... but this movie's banal plot, trite dialogue, and non-existant character development could not even give anyone room to do anything with this.
Velma...oh, my.  The joke with the glasses--one of the only few nods to the original series, along with Scooby Snacks--is forced and made me want to rip my hair out.  Her giddines of finding romantic interest near the end made me cover my eyes and shake my head with despair.
Scooby.  Where to start here.  The voice?  Ok, I'll give the movie credit for that.  The fart jokes?  Oh, WHY?!?  ...  And, quite frankly, the cartoon's version of Scooby looked more considerably dopey...this computer animated version doesn't have quite the screwy eyes the cartoon-counterpart had.
So...to recap.  Fred, a one-dimensional show-stealing sexist teams up with vacuous Daphne along with love-deprived attention-starved Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby to go to an island whose evil villain winds up being ...  Was it meant to be funny when you found out who it was?  Maybe, but the laughter was quite firmly suppressed by the amount of forced humor, bad plot, equally bad sets, and pain...lots of pain.  Sexual humor didn't belong in a cartoon, but Daphne makes it quite implict (yet painfully clear) that the ghost is doing something he shouldn't be.  The drug humor was particularly not wanted in what was originally a CHILDREN'S CARTOON...  Other liberties that were taken?  Let's see...the monsters on the island are REAL!  That never happened in the cartoon series.  Also, I don't recall any romantic interest ever being introduced either.
In the end, where do you stop?  Stop yourself by not bothering to watch this...

His relationship with the computer-animated Scooby is wonderful and really makes the movie. The only real downfall to the movie (and it's a small one)is the fact that i don't really think Freddie Prinze Jr. should have been cast as Fred. I'm sorry, but Freddie Prinze Jr. and blonde hair just don't go together. Besides this one small flaw the movie is very good and i would recommend to anyone.",1041811200,,612,4.728971962616822

I found two of the easter egg (1 about the weather and the other about Pamela Anderson)Is the music video only viewable if you put the DVD into a computer that has a DVD-Rom drive? My computer doesn't have one, so I guess I miss out! DVD distributors should put a sticker on the front of the box to tell people that some of the content is only availed if you have a DVD-Rom drive.
I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was even better than I imagined! The most enjoyable parts of the movie for me was Spooky Island and the music, and the deleted scenes and the wonderful Rowan Atkinson (Black ADDER, Mr. Bean)and the wonderful Matthew Lizzard and his relationship with Scooby. Spooky Island was so cool I want to go there! The music is great and compliments the movie well especially performances by the Baha Men and Outcast. The cartoon intro was fantastic, and the best scene in the movie was the deleted scene with Velma singing ""Can't Take my Eyes off of you"". It's a shame they didn't leave those deleted scenes in the movie, especially Velma's song. The acting was great especially Rowan, Velma, and Shaggy.
This movie is for everyone who enjoys having a good time. You don't have to be a fan of the orginal series to enjoy it. It is one of the most enjoyable movies of 2002. Other movies of 2002 I reccomend are Ice Age, Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones, Lord of the Rings 2, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.",1041552000,,1552,4.3367697594501715

Matthew Lillard's voice sounded a lot like Casey Kasem's take on Shaggy from the TV series. Oh, and the ending made a villain out of a character everyone hated anyway. There, those are my only compliments.
Scooby's annoying. Velma's nothing like herself. The ghosts are real ... and the ghosts and plot are too scary for kids. Fred is more of a one-dimensional figure now than he was when he was a cartoon. Daphne's characterization, not that they had much to build from since these aren't really ""characters"" in the sense that they ever had history or personality, is almost insulting, for they turn her into a really dim damsel-in-distress archetype. (Sarah Michelle Gellar deserves much, much better - and routinely gets better material when she's on BUFFY.)
It's not funny. The soundtrack's even annoying. It's not good for kids. It doesn't look good for a movie. And it doesn't make sense. It, in fact, makes less sense than even the most far-fetched of mysteries on the old TV show.

The plot, if you can call it that, was a pitiful rip off of ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"".
Sometimes when a movie isn't funny, you can tell where the jokes are, but you don't laugh at them. With Scooby Doo, I had a hard time even telling what I was supposed to be laughing at: that's how bad the humor was. The plot was stupid and, aside from Matthew Lillard, who did a dead-on Shaggy, the characters were completely uninteresting. At 85 minutes it still felt like it went on way too long.

My advice: don't get this movie until you've seen it beforehand and you know whether it's worth your money.
The transition from cartoon to live acting was a total bust. Cartoon gags, such as slipping on bananna peels, etc, are all very well and good when drawn with pencil and paper, but when they are performed by living actors, what was formerly funny is now just plain stupid. I think that they should have either stuck with cartoons, or left the outrageous gags out of the movie.

Sadly, anyone who remembers it fondly like the way I and millions of other people do, won't find much to love with this new, live action adaption. It's souless and uninspired. The actors here all seem to be game for the kiddie action this film is full of, and they all do their best. However, it can't salvage the film from being anything more than a bright, overdone movie for little kids who don't know much about the history or the old cartoons. The plot is as light and unconvincing as the TV show, but here it goes - The gang split up and go their seperate ways after a case. They are all reunited two years later when they are contacted to come to an exotic island called Spooky Island, where odd, supernatural things are occuring. Gee, your kidding?. While there, the gang realize that a lot of people on the island come there normal, but they soon start acting rather oddly. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what's going on or figure it out. This isn't anything new. The mystery of what's going on, who is doing it, and why they are doing it has always been as shallow as a kiddie pool. This new movie doesn't change that formula. The cast is fun and seem to be enjoying themselves. They make the most of what they got. Matthew Lillard, as Shaggy, is the best of the bunch. He really was a perfect choice for the role and he really brings the old cartoon character to life. Linda Cardellini as Velma did another fine job. She is obviously not as nerdy or unattractive as the old Velma, but she does an adequate job with the character and all of the ' jinkies ' she always has to say. Freddie Prinze, jr. is, well, he's Freddie Prinze, Jr. He really doesn't do anything with the character and doesn't do anything new or different to make anyone think that we're watching anything else but a same old Freddie Prinze, Jr. performance. Sarah Michelle Gellar. I love her. She is extremely talented, but she is wasted in a thankless role that doesn't have any character to it. It's a shame. She is so breathtakingly smart, tough, and talented in ""Buffy"", but all of that is wiped away in the vapid character of Daphne. Too bad. She is so much better than this. Comedian Rowan Atkinson of ""Mr. Bean"" fame also stars. There is also a rather odd cameo by Pamela Anderson here that just doesn't fit. The film is colorful and will sure entertain the young 'uns, but the adults who grew up on and loved the original will be bored and saddened with this new incarnation. The movie is never really funny, except for some things here and there(a certain scene with smoke coming out of the van comes to mind). It would've been great if the writers used more of that kind of comedy. Something more like a hilarious send-up like the big screen ""Brady Bunch"" movies. The movie, in one scene, resorts to low brow potty(i.e. 'farting') humor that just shouldn't of been allowed in this type of a movie. Okay, I got a tiny chuckle out of it, but it was wrong. In the end, this is a film that will no doubt be enough to satisfy the little viewers, but the older ones looking for a better homage to a beloved cartoon of long ago will be extremely disappointed.

I was looking around the section a little more and found another stack of Scooby Doo's, and again, they were Full Screen.  I decided to look through the entire pile still, because I was hopeful.  Surprisingly, I found a Wide Screen version.  Of course I picked it up.  I'm a fan of the cartoon (who isn't?), and I also enjoy Sarah Michelle Gellar as an actress.
So I went to a friends house and watched the DVD.  It was quite enjoyable.  It had very amusing parts, and it was quite reminiscent of the original cartoon series.  The story was very fun and it wasn't one of those movies that kept you glued to your seat, but it was one of those movies that kept you laughing and smiling and enjoying the entire experience.
I was actually surprised, because as I was watching it, I felt like I was a child again watching a Scooby Doo cartoon on a bright, sunny Saturday morning.  The acting wasn't Academy Award worthy, but it was good enough to make you enjoy the movie.  Scooby Doo and his antics are always amusing and it's always fun watching Mystery, Inc. solve a mystery.

The creators of the show knew what they were doing when they limited their running time to a mere half hour (minus commercials).  And, even though the film lasts only a short 86 minutes itself, this particular installment is still a full hour longer than any ""Scooby Doo"" episode has a right to be.
Although the film itself is a witless bore, special praise should still be lavished on Matthew Lillard, who does a bang up job as Shaggy, Scooby's hyperkinetic best friend.  Lillard has nailed down the look, the voice and the mannerisms of the character to a tee and one hopes his career will go far once he ends up in more substantive vehicles than the one he is trapped in here.  The other actors (Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar and Linda Cardellini) provide the requisite energy for the roles they've been called on to play and cannot be held responsible for the overall shoddy nature of the uninspired screenplay.  As with most modern day ""event"" pictures, the special effects here end up overwhelming the pedestrian storyline, but this lowest-common-denominator aspiration seems to be what pulls in the big box office bucks these days so I guess we're stuck with it, at least for the foreseeable future.  Scooby Doo himself seems like just another CGI effect, partly because, as a character, his inarticulateness ends up relegating him to the status of secondary player in his own movie.  He just doesn't seem very important to the action of the story.
""Scooby Doo"" has a nice, sunny look to it and it is never really offensively bad.  It simply makes one nostalgic for the days when crowd-pleasing blockbusters (""Star Wars,"" ""E.T."" etc.) could, in addition to entertaining us, make us both believe and care.",1037404800,,1952,4.754437869822485

As a long time fan of the cartoon, I loved how they were able to recreate the cartoon characters without trying to change them. Oh sure, there's a bit of potty humor in it, but geez, this is the age we live in. Frankly, it wasn't nearly as bad as some other movies employing the same technique. It was quite mild. The cast was incredible. Sarah Michelle Gellar can play virtually any role she wants and make believable. She's great as Daphne. I couldn't believe how dead on Matthew Lilliard was as Shaggy, he even got the voice right!

Of course, it won't make me laugh or anything, but its entertainment. When I heard they were making a Scooby-Doo movie, all I did was shrug and say ""ah"". I planned on seeing it. I tryed a couple of times to see it theaters, but I ended up seeing other things instead. Then, it came out on video, and I rented it. The first 5 minutes, where the ""gang"" are in the factory, I thought ""God, I'm not going to watch all of this junk"", and ""Oh, yeah, that looks real"". I thought that 'til right up when the marijuana reference kicked in. (The part where Shaggy says ""Me & Scoob went to do what we do best"", an then all the smoke comes out of the van, and turns out to just be smoke from a grill.) That got a laugh. After that, I was pretty open to the rest of the movie. And there are about 2 more references to drugs after that (""I got a bag of...hamburgers"", ""Mary Jane? That's my favorite name!""). And the movie isn't just a complete imitation of the 60's show (which you could tell by what you just read), and in some parts, it actully spoofs it. The only problem is the special effects. I'm sure this movie got a HUGE budget, and they could afford better effects for (at least) Scooby-Doo, the so-called star. For me, the star is Matthew Lillard, who steals the show with his performance of Shaggy. And the whole Scrappy thing's hilarious, too. WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1036713600,2,1490,4.25
1758591,2,B00006HBUA,"There are probably people out there who will appreciate Scooby-Doo's ""charms"" more than I will.  Namely, this would apply to kids.  I have a hard time seeing a middle-aged adult who, regardless of whether or not he was a fan of the old cartoon series, actually enjoying this picture.  This live-action rendition of Scooby-Doo manages to be even sillier than the show it's based off of, and somehow, it's even more boring.
Mystery, Inc. consists of a group of teens who go around solving, well, mysteries, usually involving ghouls and monsters, though the truth usually reveals itself as a human in disguise.  There's arrogant Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr., who's actually perfectly suited for this role), nerdy Velma (Linda Cardellini), vacantly pretty Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), bumbling goof Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and of course, Scooby-Doo himself, appearing courtesy of the latest and most high-tech in special effects.
After a two-year separation, the team comes back together to solve strange things going on on an amusement park island.  The kids who arrive at the park come out like brain-washed zombies and the owner wants to know who or what is behind this. And extremely ludicrous stuff happens from there on out.
Yes, I realize I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously, but it fails at the most basic level of entertainment.  The jokes aren't funny (in fact, a few of them are cringe-inducing), the acting's mostly pathetic, and the proceedings simply lack a good sense of fun.  Sure, there are a lot of slapstick action sequences, fights with monsters, booby traps, and secret doorways, but it's all brought down by Raja Gosnell's lackluster direction and the cast's inability to appear or sound like anything more than a bunch of actors desperately trying not to be upstaged by a CGI-dog.
And when you get right down to it, that's the only reason this movie exists; to showcase a silly Great Dane with cartoonish CGI.  On that level, I suppose there's some satisfaction to be had.  Scooby-Doo himself is a fairly impressive special effect.  The obviousness of it is definitely intentional, and the dog himself, while never actually provoking any genuine laughs, has a few amusing moments.
The same cannot be said for the actors.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is easily the worst of this cast, taking what should be a relatively simple role and still managing to seem rather flat.  Linda Cardellini is probably too busty and nubile for the role of Velma, but I guess she's okay to the extent playing such a character can afford.  Sarah Michelle Gellar can be a decent actress, and while she plays this vapid role to a tee, this doesn't change the fact she's incredibly annoying.  Matthew Lillard is also hard to watch, particularly in a fart contest that will probably have the kids rolling in laughter.  He does, however, make a pretty fair imitation of Kasey Kasem's voice.
Scooby-Doo, the movie, has one fittingly enjoyable segment, involving protoplasm and body-switching, of all things.  For about five minutes, I actually found myself perking up from dullsville and even chuckling a few times.  But once that segment ended, the film went straight back to the garbage bin, particularly with a twist ending that's indescribably silly, even for a live-action cartoon.
This is another strike for director Gosnell, the only other movie of his I've seen being Big Momma's house.  But does it even matter who directs a movie like this?  So long as the CGI dog is around, the kids'll rush in droves, and this will soon be a franchise that will milk all its money's worth before disappearing in cinematic oblivion.  But that won't be for another five years.

They did an even amazing job turning Scooby Doo into a computerized live action version to where Scooby is extremely realistic. As for the cast, I heard the rumors that everyone was basically disappointed. I wasn't I thought they picked the cast perfectly for the part. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Trying to forget about her Buffy character) did a great job playing the new aged Daphne, Matthew Lillard was the best part of the casting job as Shaggy!!! Linda Cardelini was beautifully transformed into the part of Velma, and as much as I love him Freddie Prince Jr. did an ""okay"" job of Fred. Not to mention one of my favorite actors and comedians Rowan Atkinson does a fabulous job in the film. Also for the Scrappy Doo lovers, you might be suprised, but definately not disappointed. The movie is upgraded to be in ""the now."" And the background and sets are truly amazing and like a animated cartoon version for a live action movie. There is quite a bit of adult humor, but still makes if fun for young kids. I would think the film is great for ages 13 and up. But I think kids and adults will enjoy this movie from the cartoon and lovers of Scooby Doo. It does get silly in a bit parts and slow, so in that retrospect it might be dull to some. But the plot and the charaterizations performed by the cast did a brilliant job.
As for the DVD I would give that an A. I loved all the extra's on the DVD. From the never seen before footage, behind the scene's documentary, an interactive triva game, Commentary from the cast and filmakers and much much more.

1758615,3,B00006HBUA,"Scooby-Doo as a live action flick is an intriguing idea, and in many ways this film faithfully recreates the world of the 1960's cartoon. But overall, it made me want to turn it off and put in the original cartoon instead.
What this film does right is the sets, costuming and props. They all have to perfect mix of the cartoon and the real world. It really feels like the world of Scooby-Doo could exist somewhere. Also, the performance by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy is dead-on. He is perfect in the role. Also the voice of Scooby is dead-on as well, but unfortunately all the other actors are not quite the same.
Freddy Prinze's Fred is very much off. It didn't seem like him at all. Daphne was too quirky for her own good, and Velma's characterization was close, but no cigar. Perhaps most disappointing was the CGI Scooby, who was too cartoony next to the real actors. The lighting on the CGI was always too bright for conditions, and over-all provided a distraction.
The story also seemed to drag halfway through, like it was a plot for a half-hour cartoon stretched into a feature length film (which it basically is). It just seems like the stories of Scooby-Doo are better suited for short cartoons. The film could have avoided this, however, if it had given an origin story, telling how the crew of Mystery Inc. first got together.
This film is worth seeing for Lillard's awesome Shaggy performance, but otherwise stick to the original cartoon.",1036281600,2,1450,4.66796875

I rented the movie since when younger I used to watch the Scooby Doo cartoons and enjoyed them, I was also told that the movie had very good special effects.

1758617,4,B00006HBUA,"I have to confess that I picked 'Scooby-Doo' out to watch because Sarah Michelle Gellar is in it, and I am a died-in-the-wool Buffy fan.  Had that not been the case I would no doubt have passed it by.  And so I would have managed to miss the kind of utter silliness that somehow manages to entertain and warm the heart.  But be warned, if you have a low tolerance for the utterly ridiculous you may find this film a harrowing experience.
The film opens with the breakup of the Scooby Gang.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred (Freddie Prinz), who always taking credit for her plans.  Daphne (SMG) is tired of always being the one who is carried of by the villain.  And Shaggy (Matthew Lillard)?  Well, Shaggy and Scooby are a bit too focused on food, as usual.  Everyone stomps off in separate directions.  Two years later all meet again in an airport, having been individually invited to help investigate a problem at Spooky Island.  As Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson) the theme park owner explains it, the college students who frequent the island on holiday are being changed somehow.  He is desperate for help.
And so begins a crazy pastiche of monsters, chase scenes, dark rituals, and slapstick meant purely to entertain and amuse.  For the most part made for the young, the film appeals equally to those who recall their Scooby watching youth with fondness or who are willing to set aside all requirements of believability.  Of course, the film is almost entirely action, with only fitful attempts at character development.  For 90 minutes, director Raja Gosnell manages to make sure that there is never a moment when that lacks something diverting to capture one's attention.
Initially I was a bit put off but the animation for Scooby-Doo.  But the mind's eye, wonderful organ that it is, quickly makes the adjustment.  The 'making of Scooby-Doo' extra makes quite a bit of the difficulties of acting with an animated character - of knowing where to look and how to react when there is nothing there.  And when you look at the film, the actors' interaction with Scooby is totally natural, which goes far to make it all believable.  In the final analysis, the dog comes very close to running away with the show.
The film does have redeeming values, as well as being pure entertainment.  Friendship becomes one of the driving forces of the plot, much more so than it ever was in the cartoon.  One thing I did not care for was some gratuitous crudeness that I feel went too far.  Not doubt this was the reason that the film received its PG rating.  While hardly ruining the film, it detracts from an otherwise very positive experience.",1036022400,8,2644,4.702173913043478

The ""homage/tribute"" is washed away so quickly from the mind, as you are constantly questioning when would Shaggy and Scooby compete in a farting contest, or when velma would be dancing in a womens shower room dressed a bikini (A scene cut from the movie, as it was deemed inapropiate for a pg rating).
As a stand-alone movie, this is one to avoid.

1758619,3,B00006HBUA,"First, a word on the cast.  I must agree with the reviewer who said that the characters were generally well-cast. Though I'm not familiar with the work of Freddie Prinze, Jr. outside of SD, he did a respectable job.  Like the Trekkers before her, I fear that Sarah Michelle Gellar will forever be Buffy. Nuff said.  I was also unfamiliar with the work of Linda Cardellini, but she nailed the part of Velma. A true joy to watch.  Scooby was well done, and belivable within reason.  Finally, Matthew Lillard simply stole the show as Shaggy.  Nice to know that someone is carrying on the fine work started by Casey Kasem.
The plot was the distraction for me.  As an ""old school"" SD fan, I've been somewhat disappointed in the trend of the recent animated films and this live action go.  Seeing the bad guy unmasked at the end of the day is more difficult than saying that there truly were supernatural forces at work.  The film certainly had its fair share of ""classic"" moments, though I could have done without one particular aspect.  If you've seen the film, you know where I'm going.  Anyway...

The chase scenes, danger-prone Daphne getting into trouble etc.  Matt Lillard is the breakout star as he really became Shaggy in the film, from the voice to the laid-back, lanky movements.  The actress who played Velma (can't remember her name) also did a fantastic job too.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar weren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  I didn't like Scooby's CG animated look too much, but I got past that with his cute antics and  funny ""reech ratterns.""  I also didn't like that Fred was portrayed as somewhat dim-witted.  In the original series, he wasn't dim at all.  Other than that, I really enjoyed this picture.  Non Scooby fans may find it childish and stupid, but it is aimed at young kids.  Most Scooby Doo fans will enjoy it but I think that non-fans can enjoy this film too, if they give it a chance.

1758622,3,B00006HBUA,"The key to enjoying SCOOBY DOO is not to expect too much.  The producers have billed the film as half hommage, half parody; in truth, it isn't really close enough to the original cartoon to be called hommage and it really doesn't go far enough to be called parody, and as usual Hollywood makes the mistake of trying to cover up the script's inadequacies with big-budget production values and expensive but actually so-so special effects.  All the same, the film does have its moments.  The story finds Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy splitting up due to ego conflicts--and then being unexpectedly reunited when the owner of a teen resort called ""Spooky Island"" invites them in to find out why his guests arrive as normal teens and then depart as, well, ZOMBIES.

The script is fairly mundane, but it does have a few zingers, as when Velma says ""Let's get jinky with it!""  And although the cast is a mixed bag, they work hard to bring it off.  Freddie Prinze is wildly miscast as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar is not an ideal Daphne, but they play with tremendous energy; Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, however, are so dead on target with their performances that they create an amazing sense of deja vu.  As for Scooby Doo, he is (of course) a computerized animation.  And so are most of the monsters the gang encounters on Spooky Island.  Although it works reasonably well, it isn't anything to write home about.

I would recommend that parents preview the film before unleashing it upon their kids; some younger children may be unnerved by the monsters.  The DVD comes with a number of extras that include some cut scenes--and they offer an interesting contrast with the film, for they are very satirical.  Seeing them left me with the feeling that the film would have been much more entertaining if those scenes had been left in and the whole thing had been done with the same bite.  As it is--SCOOBY DOO is neither a great film nor a memorable film.  But we're all occasionally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.

Can't imagine why Freddie Prinze, Jr. would come to mind for the part of Fred (other than the obvious name sharing), but he did just fine in the role.

 Scooby-Doo is a great movie! I've watched Scooby cartoons all my life, and found this movie to be tons of fun! But it's not for everyone! There are those certain Scooby fans who can't stand it when the supernatural events in a Scooby story turn out to be real instead of just a man in a mask. Well, if you're that type, you may not like this film, but then, maybe you will. See, in this movie the Mystery involves both the Supernatural, AND the villain in a mask routine! Then, believe it or not, there are those out there who are loyal fans of Scrappy-Doo! Well, if you love Scrappy, you will probably hate this movie, as it involves a lot of extreme Scrappy bashing. Yes, he's in this movie, and yes, he plays a major role (though with minimum screen time), but Scrappy is depicted in a very negative light. This was done mostly because so many fans hate Scrappy, but as I said, some people do love him. As for me, I like him okay, loved him as a kid, but I can go both ways on the subject now, and I can easily take a little Scrappy bashing so it didn't bother me. Now, the sets in this film are amazing! Very spooky and funny at the same time! As for the casting; perfect Shaggy, great (though much more attractive than the cartoon) Velma, gorgeous as always Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a perfect Daphne, and her new hubby (grrrr) Freddie Prince, Jr. does a sufficient job with Fred, a character that was never that great to begin with. I probably wouldn't have cast Freddie P. as Fred, since the voice isn't right and he doesn't look that much like him either, but he doesn't hurt the film at all. It's not like Rosie O'Donnel trying to convince us she's Betty Rubble, ruining what otherwise was a great Flintstone movie (oh, and the kids were too old in that one, but that's a whole other review). As for the CGI Scooby and Scrappy-Doo, well, they're obviously CGI, but they're still pretty good once you adjust your eyes and your mind to ignore that aspect. They just needed some better light and shadow work in a lot of their scenes. A lot of fans didn't like the look Scooby had, but I thought it was a great interpretation of Scooby as a ""real"" dog. I mean, that's a tricky thing to have to do. Overall, this is a FUN movie, that's the key word. Even my dad sat and watched all of this one, which was surprising. Of course, some people will just watch to see Sarah Michelle Gellar I suppose. I should also point out that Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) plays Mr. Mondavarious, and gives one of his usual hilarious performances! The DVD is great by the way, with some nice behind the scenes stuff, and a great CAST commentary! Definitely a must own for fans of Scooby-Doo or cartoon movies in general (By the way, if you like this one be sure to get the Josie and the Pussycats live-action movie)! The deleted scenes on the Scooby-Doo DVD are really great, and most, if not all of them, would have been great to see in the actual film! Especially the wonderful animated opening! They truly should have left that one in! As for the sequels that were talked about so much on the commentary, I'm looking forward to them, but I better see Scooby-Dum in one of them, and please, no Scooby-Dum bashing! I love that guy! Dum dum dum duuummmmmm!",1035158400,4,4954,4.497225305216427

1758674,3,B00006HBUA,"Wow, I really thought I was going to loath this movie in every shape and form.  I really did not want to see this movie, but I was forced to watch it with my family.  But to my surprise, I found the movie ""Scooby-Doo"" to be pretty entertaining and decent.  It's nothing I'm going to see again any time soon, but it is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.
The film version follows the cartoon pretty well.  Mystery Inc. is on the verge of breaking up forever until they are invited to a spookey theme park where the owner thinks there is something strange going on.  So it is up to them to uncover the mystery and find out why people who leave the park seem like mindless zombies.  As with the cartoons, there are tons of twist, surprises, and a logical explanation at the end.
What really made me like the movie was Matthew Lillard.  He was a true spitting image of Shaggy in every possible way; he even sounded like him!  And even the animated Scooby, which I thought would turn out really bad, was very comical and convincing.  The rest of the cast was all right, but it was really Matthe Lillard who made me appreciate the movie more.
The DVD is pretty cool.  Lots of special features, the picture looks great and the sound was also pretty impressive.  However, the menu is terrible!  It's very confusing to figure out which option or feature is highlighted at first.  One of the worst I have seen on a DVD in a long time.
All in all, ""Scooby-Doo"" turned out to be an all right film.  I don't love it, but I don't hate it.  I guess it's somewhere in the middle.  Am I ever going to want to see it again.  Probably not.  But, I will say I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  If you're a fan of the cartoon show, chances are you will enjoy this movie.

But instead, I found myself thoroughly enjoying my time watching Mystery Inc back in action!  Freddy Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar star along side Matthew Lilliard and Linda Cardellini as the infamous Scooby gang: Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Velma.  Each of the actors puts forth a great performance, from Velma's intelligence to the almost perfect sound of Shaggy's voice.  And Scooby is excellent as a CGI character who interacts with the rest of the cast remarkably.
This movie has a few tongue in cheek jokes, a lot of great laughs, and some stellar performances.  It's well worth checking out and the audio commentary by the cast is enjoyable as well!  Check this out and you will enjoy it!",1034640000,,854,4.697986577181208

If anyone has ever seen the cartoon you have a million questions - like why does the gang hate each other? They never disbanded in hatred of each other! Were Fred and Daphne interested in each other in the cartoon? Who decided they should date? Shaggy all of the sudden has an interest in women over food and Scooby?
They went about this all wrong. the only right thing was the parts of Shaggy and Scooby. They were the most true to the original. The director should have played more on the simplicity of the story lines and look of the cartoon rather than dulling it up with a convoluted plot line that is unplausable and is just plain stupid.

It's like they took the 2-D further without dissing the cartoon and I actually liked the CGI Scooby better than the animated one. I nixed one star off for the deleted scenes.

They did a good job with the animation of scooby-doo.  He was also very funny.  I just couldn't believe that they made scrappy-doo to be the evil one.  I always thought that he was just jealous of scooby's fame. I liked how freddie played fred.  I liked how sarah played daphne.  My favorite will always be Matthew Lillard.  He did a VERY, VERY good job portraying shaggy. I have watched about 10 times and I never get tired of it.  I laugh every time that I see it.  Overall, it was a very good movie.

1758681,2,B00006HBUA,"Scooby Doo, Where Are You? was a staple of my Saturday mornings as a youth. It was entertaining and, to me, at that age, a bit creepy. The cartoon series today is still charming and even a bit more disturbing now that I know what some of the ""in-jokes"" are today. The live action film adaptation is almost an exact replication of the cartoon series. That is both a compliment and an insult to those involved. Let me explain....
First of all, the kids will love this film. It is going to entertain them for hours on end and I'm sure they'll watch it over and over. That's who it's for isn't it? For them, it's going to be a four or five star affair. As parents, you can feel secure that the humor is clean enough (with enough innocuous potty humor thrown in to appease even the most jaded of 8 year olds), even if a couple of the scares are a bit intense.
For those raised on the cartoon and expecting something more powerful, you probably won't feel the same way. My review is from the standpoint of an adult trying to recapture my youthful enjoyment of that old series. Don't do it! Here's the details:
Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are almost creepy in their dead-on portrayals of their cartoon selves. Lillard, in particular, seems to be channelling Casey Kasem's voice work AND the cartoons bizarre movements for that character. Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Danger-prone Daphne breathe a bit of new life into their cartoon selves. We discover that Fred is vain to the point of preening and Daphne is not just gorgeous, but a bit of an idiot. Scooby Doo is a computer generated character that will eventually have you believing that he must have really existed in his interactions with the actors. This is a tremendous compliment to the actors who had to do a great deal of blue or green screen work interacting with empty space.
Lillard as Shaggy (and Scooby Doo, but he's really not there) is the real ""star"" of the show and needs to receive kudos for not only his dynamite portrayal, but his fantastically believable interactions with the non-existent Scooby Doo.
What I didn't like about the film is that it is too much like the episodes and not enough like them all at the same time. The DVD extras lets us know that the filmmakers made a big mistake in not seguing the cartoon version opening credits into the live action film. It would have been great for those of us wanting a dip in the nostalgia pool (after all we have to take the kids, don't we?).
Also, the villain in this piece is actually a bit on the horrific side, if you're taking the wee ones to see the film. That's surprising since the filmmakers make comments that they wanted to be sure to target the kids.
Finally, if the filmmakers are merely going to remake an episode of the cartoon, what's the point? Why not just make a full length cartoon version of the quality of the original series?
Ultimately, it is an enjoyable distraction to view this film. The actors are having fun and they make you want to have fun. The filmmaker wisely decided to maintain the bright day glo colors of the costumes for the cast.  Too bad the whole film isn't as bright as those colors.",1034553600,,3181,4.48448275862069

It's too bad the innocence of the original cartoon was thrown out for 21st century ""gottagrabyawithflesh"" movie making.  Kid's have enough sexual influences and unfortunately this movie is no exception.  Hemn lines are too high and the ladies dresses are cut much too low.  Sexual references are very low and not problematic.
The movie drops rank with the cartoon with it's ""real"" monsters.  These particular monsters happen to be demonic.  They ""possess"" the bodies of all the visitors of Scary Island.  Add to this  an ancient mystic alphabet with the ability to call up an evil army to take over the world.
I know many would disagree and say that we are taking this too seriously, but the influences on our children's live are very serious.
The show is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed if you know where it's going and what you're getting into.
