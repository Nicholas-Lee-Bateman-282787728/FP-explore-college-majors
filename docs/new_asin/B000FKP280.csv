They said the palace has over 3OO Rooms, but i was shown just four rooms, and then later on we were taken back and got shown those four rooms again. I was shown the throne room several times. There were also beautiful paintings on the ceiling, lovely chandliers, charming clocks, and statues, ect. And we were also shown a few black and white silent clips of Prince Rainer and Princess Grace. But i was very dissapointed at not seeing very much of inside the Palace. I know that most of my viewing time was spent just looking at the Palace. And that was all from the outside too.,",1333929600,3,666,4.4227642276422765
8124112,5,B000FKP280,"If you are a wannabe citizen of Monaco like myself then you will be absolutely thrilled with this production.  What a wonderful production by A&E home video.  Wonderful insider footage of the Palais d'Princier and a tale of the courtship of Rainier(mispronounced as Ran-eer as opposed to Ren-yay in the video, but this does not affect the viewing obviously) and Grace Kelly.  There is also a great history to the Palais d'Princier.  If you are a fan of Monaco, Grace Kelly, or palaces in general then buy this DVD!",1198800000,5,514,4.741573033707865
