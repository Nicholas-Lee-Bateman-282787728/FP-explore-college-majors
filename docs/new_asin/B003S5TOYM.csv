8404010,5,B003S5TOYM,I had the pleasure of being  in China when this movie was released and watched it with a friend.  It was subtitled so I had no problem with the viewing.  Fantastic cinematography and excellent acting with a superb story line.  I put it on my shelf right next to The Warlords.  It's a must-see if your half the Sinophile I am.,1289779200,,325,4.262295081967213
