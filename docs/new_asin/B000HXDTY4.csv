8142339,3,B000HXDTY4,"As the titles implies, the movies were in excellent quality and even arrived weeks sooner than expected. I will however note that this DVD set is for REGION 2, for those of you that don't understand it means it won't play in your DVD player unless it's a region free player.

 If you have a computer ( as I'm sure most of us here on Amazon do) than you should be ok to watch it that way ( even though you will have to change your region settings to watch it)

 I should have known as this product came from the U.K., this time it's my fault and I've learned my lesson : DON'T BUY DVD'S OUTSIDE THE USA! Lol

 This set is worth buying if your European, have a region free player, or are an Alan Moore enthusiast.
