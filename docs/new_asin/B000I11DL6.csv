The family prayer at meals and bedtime are great. My girls love to copy the prayer after they finish their own!",1296864000,,286,4.39622641509434
2650992,5,B000I11DL6,"As as fitness instructor and mom I absolutely recommend this DVD.  It is another great one in the entire series of DVDs.  What is so great in this one is the focus on being active, and all the fun ways to do it.  My 2-1/2 year old daughter joins in moving around with Boz and the kids during the video and often reenacts it long after.  She also finds it amusing to sing about eating fruits and vegetables, and when she is eating them, talks about how Boz would be proud of her.  I am delighted with this DVD because it encourages the little minds to start taking care of their little bodies; that they are honoring God by being healthy.  With childhood obesity in epidemic proportions, this is a DVD that is worth the TV time.",1173830400,3,727,4.2700729927007295
2650993,4,B000I11DL6,"We now have all the current DVDs in the Boz series. We got this one and the imagination one for Christmas and they are even more enjoyable than the last two. The songs are more catchy and fun, and even though these DVDs can be a little corny and ""Barney"" like, they are worth it.

Now, if only my son will watch this one enough to learn how to eat a better variety of foods. LOL",1167177600,3,378,3.973684210526316
