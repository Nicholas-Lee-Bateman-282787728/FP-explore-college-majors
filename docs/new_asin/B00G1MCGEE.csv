8620087,5,B00G1MCGEE,"THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is a big-budgeted opulent Bond film, with a lively and strong screenplay by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum and very effective editing by John Glen, delivering one of the most succinctly structured films of the series under the direction of Lewis Gilbert. After THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN Roger Moore clearly redefined his approach to the role as the good-natured British agent. His Bond is suave, debonair, never condescending and resorts to seriousness only when confronted with malevolence. That was the way he played it for the rest of the series. The globetrotting THE SPY WHO LOVED ME featured a gadget laden Lotus Esprit as its centerpiece along with Richard Kiel as the indestructible Jaws the villain's henchman with steel teeth. The main villain of the piece is the maniacal Karl Stromberg, played with detached amusement by Curt Jurgens, whose immense wealth featured an aquatic empire aimed at global domination. Bond must pair up with Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova played by Barbara Bach to track down missing nuclear submarines. The pre-title sequence features a very thrilling and well-filmed ski chase re-establishing James Bond as a major force to be reckoned with. Marvin Hamlisch composed a very effective score to the surprise of many. His music is right on mark and in some sequences very innovative. Hamlisch proves that he really knows how to score a film. Ken Adam returned as production designer bringing a familiar look back to the series not seen since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Ken Adam also introduced some new concepts giving the film a well-known but unique look. New characters are introduced in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME who would return in subsequent films of the series. They include Walter Gotell as Russian General Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the British Minister of Defense and Eva Reuber-Staier as Rubelvitch, Gogol's secretary. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and in expanded roles Bernard Lee as ""M"" and Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" Major Boothroyd are all back. There are well-choreographed great action scenes, beautiful underwater sequences, battles and chases. Some of the best-unsung workmanship in this film is the extraordinary miniatures by Derek Meddings. They are incredible and make this film very impressive and memorable. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is one of those rare films where all the talents come together at their peek of perfection delivering an impeccable film.

THE SPY WHO LOVED ME revived and brought new life, renewing the James Bond series for both new and old fans.",1425081600,,2539,5.074162679425838
