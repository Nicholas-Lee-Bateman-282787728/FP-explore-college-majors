8421784,5,B004BA5YHY,"A lot of criticism has been levelled at this film, along with considerable incredulity that it attracted Pele and John Huston to its cast. Lets set the record straight. This is a true story, which John Huston was passionate about bringing to the screen. Which is why he worked so hard to put the project together. Pele was in it because he was involved in the events depicted in the film. The film cast one or two other of the original protagonists to play themselves, and also, I believe, genuine orphans to play the orphans. This was intended to lend authenticity to the performances, which it does. It also lends a natural, unforced, quality to the performances of the children. The quality of the script and direction is such that you don't need precursor events to set up one's knowledge of the children's characters. They are simply who they are, and the viewer, if paying attention, understands them and their motivations immediately. This film is admittedly not typically in the American style, as it does not spell everything out. It tends more towards the European style of film making, with its lean and spare script assuming intelligence in the viewer. I love the refreshingly un-cutesie nature of the film, and the fact that its not a straight-forward City Corporation bad, orphans good story. It is never that black and white.",1428969600,,1340,4.8304347826086955

8421787,3,B004BA5YHY,"I happened upon this little jewel when a local video store was going out of business.  It's a little known beauty that soccer lovers and Pele fanatics should see.  Briefly, an orphanage is about to go caput and the priest in charge calls up his old friend Pele to help.  Hey, at least look at the used copies for really cheap.  It's worth it, just like ""Victory,"" an even better soccer movie with not only Pele, but also a young Sly Stallone. Oh, yes, and Pele plays guitar and says the memorable, ""It is important to be a good soccer player.  But what is more important is to be a good man.""",1105747200,,592,4.25
