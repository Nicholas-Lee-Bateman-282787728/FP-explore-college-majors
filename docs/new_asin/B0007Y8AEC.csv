2251876,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Okay, so maybe it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definetly worth looking into. It's probably not like anything you've seen before, and so much better than all those big name new releases that get so hyped up, but end up sucking (which is most of them). The acting was superb, as well as the story and the way they filmed it. It definetly caught me off guard a few times, never knowing what the characters were going to say (...""Bleep!"")or do. It was a funny yet sad movie that had a real beauty to it,and depth to the characters...maybe you know someone just like them....or maybe it will remind you in some ways of yourself...making you realize you're not so flawed, you're just like the rest of us.",1122595200,2,710,4.427480916030534
2251877,4,B0007Y8AEC,"This wonderfully funny film-certainly the first OCD Comedy with a touch of Tourette's Syndrome-was actually a  film for British television. The salty language and the brief nudity go way beyond what we would see on the air in this country-that's for sure. Director Adrin Shergold is primarily a Brit TV director. He has directed 26 television shows since 1990-but no feature films. Unfortunately-this movie never had an American theatrical release-not even through the various festivals. It went directly to DVD. Even Roger Ebert had not seen it, or reviewed it.

  Michael Sheen (no relation to Martin Sheen, whose real name is Estevez) was incredibly good as protagonist Mark Furness. His consistent tics and mannerisms required great skill to pull off. In some odd way-he made us care about this complete misfit. At midpoint in the film-when Charlotte ferreted out Mark-found him living alone in filth-unbathed, bearded and long-haired-and quite crazy-having given in completely to the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and some form of Tourette's-we get a glimpse of the great acting talent that Sheen has. This character became a truly mad hermit-worthy of a Shakespearian scenario.

  Sheen has done a lot of live theatre work-plays like LOOK BACK IN ANGER, AMADEUS, and CALIGULA. He has had 23 film appearances-most of them on television. He had a small part in the recent film, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Word is that he lived for a time with the luscious Kate Beckinsale-and they had a child together.

  Shirley Henderson played Charlotte-his very ill, barely functional gal-pal-almost lover. She played Moaning Myrtle in the HARRY POTTER films. [I just completed reading Book Six: The Half-Blood Prince-and what a shocker of an ending it had!] Henderson was quite good in this little film-tough yet vulnerable-sexy yet pathetic-intelligent yet still mentally ill.

  I really wish this film had found a way to be released in theatres. I think it would have done well-perhaps as well as the new Indie, YOU AND ME AND EVERYONE ELSE WE KNOW (2005). FILTHY LOVE has a distinct charm, has clever writing, and wonderful acting-and it was flat-out funny.",1121817600,3,2146,5.167630057803469
2251878,4,B0007Y8AEC,"No, this is not a film about kinky sexual exploits.  The ""dirty filthy"" of the title relates to the fears of some obsessive compulsive types who fret about the preponderance of dirt and germs in everyday life.  Michael Sheen plays a man that has watched his life disintegrate as the combination of Tourette's Syndrome and OCD begins to affect his behavior.  This leads to more stress, which only causes more tics, barks and other alarming expressions that cause further problems (his wife has left him, he's lost his job etc.); and the additional stress only causes further symptoms to manifest themselves.

Shirley Henderson is the leader of an OCD support group, with problems of her own.  She has issues with odd numbers and will politely send away the third, fifth or seventh person to join a conversation.  Her attempts to help Sheen become aware of his illness and to cope with it form the basis for this poignant and often funny story.

I'm a sucker for almost any Sundance Film Festival selection, and this film doesn't disappoint.  It deals compassionately with issues of illness that are all too frequently ignored or mocked.  While I've never before seen Michael Sheen or Shirley Henderson, I hope to see their work again very soon.",1119398400,7,1243,4.8530805687203795
2251879,4,B0007Y8AEC,"A quirky Sundance film which I found pretty charming.  It's about a man with low-level Tourette Syndrome, who doesn't even realize he's got it or know what it is.  He loses his job and his wife because of his odd behavior, which only exacerbates his condition.  This leads him to finally discover his illness, and start grappling with it, and realize he's had it all his life.  Quite appealing performances from the whole cast.  4 stars (for some intrusive ""Tourette camerawork."")",1117670400,2,480,4.8765432098765435

2251901,5,B0007Y8AEC,"This is an excellent movie, not the type of thing Hollywood typically puts out these days---it's actually about people and relationships. It's somewhat like Silver Linings Playbook in that it's about mental illness. It's done with both compassion and humor. The acting is excellent. I bought it after renting it---I liked it that much.",1376265600,,335,5.222222222222222

2251903,5,B0007Y8AEC,The movie was indeed an eye opener for this type of mental illness. Even though its was tastefully done and considered a comedy it did hit its serious notes when it came to exposing the pain people go through while suffering OCD!,1344124800,,229,4.476190476190476
2251904,5,B0007Y8AEC,"We read about OCD, about Tourette's.  We might be amused to hear of people who have to clean door handles before they can open the door.  We might be entertained, we might be saddened, or annoyed, by people who are compelled to blurt out obscenities on the bus or at work.  And if we think about losing a job or a spouse because it's really hard to get out of the house or up the stairs, then we might start thinking it's really sad.

And if you want to find out what it might be like to live inside this condition, inside the tragedy of your own life unraveling, becoming one of those bruised, jerking, dirty, homeless, twisted wrecks, whose eyes we cannot meet, who we simply want to pass by in the street, then you should watch this movie.

And if you do watch it, I promise you'll gripped by the dramatic twists and turns of the story.  And with any luck, you'll begin to see those people on the street in an entirely new light.",1342224000,,932,4.237288135593221
2251905,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Actor and director Adrian Shergold`s eight television film which was written by British screenwriter and television producer Jeff Pope and Welsh actor and writer Ian Puleston-Davies, is inspired by Ian Puleston-Davies personal experiences with OCD. It was shot on location in London, England and is a United Kingdom production which was produced by English producer Christine Langan. It tells the story about Mark Furness, an architect from London with Tourette`s Syndrome and Obsessive compulsive disorder who is going through a separation. After moving into a new apartment and then losing his job, Mark`s condition overpowers him and his behavior becomes increasingly compulsive. His best friends Nathan and Kathy tries to support him, but Mark is still in love with his ex-wife Stevie and is only focused on how he can win her back. All though unaware of his conditions, Mark notices that his behavior has changed and visits his doctor who still thinks that he suffers from clinical depression. On his way out from the doctor, Mark meets a young woman named Charlotte who invites him to join her at a therapy meeting. Mark goes to the meeting, and while listening to other people talking about their compulsions, he begins to recognize himself in what they are saying and evolves a friendship with Charlotte.

Finely and engagingly directed by Adrian Shergold, this darkly humerous and romantic drama draws an empathic portrayal of an afflicted though inspirited man`s journey towards discovering his identity and his relationship with a shy and caring woman who really understands him and his conditions. While notable for its quick-witted dialog and both awkward and comical situations, this character-driven and dialog-driven story contains a moving study of character about a person living with an unpredictable and at times uncontrollable neurological disorder that leads him to the brink of his sanity and sometimes surprises him as much as it surprises his acquaintances and other people.

This incisive depiction of people living with Tourette`s Syndrome and OCD which, as most films about Tourette`s, somewhat exaggerates the protagonist`s vocal tics is impelled and reinforced by the brilliant acting performances by Welsh actor Michael Sheen and Scottish actress Shirley Henderson. A charming, bittersweet and heartrending tale which gained nominations for Best Actor (Male) Michael Sheen, Best Actor (Female) Shirley Henderson and the RTS Television Award for Best Single Drama at the Royal Television Society Awards, UK in 2005.",1341705600,,2545,5.408060453400504

2251907,5,B0007Y8AEC,"I saw this movie a few years ago and loved it. I have been looking for it to purchase since then, and could never find it (probably because it's an Indie movie and not really mainstream).  Found it on Amazon.  Watched it the day I received it, and it was as good as the first time I saw it.  For anyone interested in psych disorders, this movie is enlightening, poignant, funny, sad, uplifting and puts a spin on obsessive-compulsive disorder that the average person doesn't get to see or experience.  I recommend this movie highly.",1323561600,,532,4.568421052631579
2251908,5,B0007Y8AEC,"I was amazed at how on spot this movie was. It not only showed the down sides too having OCD issues, but it also had its moments of hilarity.

2251909,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Michael Sheen is absolutely amazing in this movie. Originally a Sundance film, Dirty Flthy Love has made it to DVD. It's smart, funny and very poignant.

The movie follows Mark, a successful architect, who's life begins to fall apart when he displays signs of Tourette's Syndrome as well as extreme OCD. After his uncontrollable cursing, barking, facial ticks and strange behavior cause Mark to lose his wife, his friends and his job, he decides to fight the disease by going to group therapy. The group is lead by a fellow OCD sufferer named Charlotte (played by a wonderful Shirley Henderson) who inspires Mark to rebuild his life. Charlotte and Mark become fast friends but their relationship is strained when Mark becomes obsessed with getting his wife back and eventually deteriorates when he realizes the disease is getting the better of him.

Sweet and funny, I highly recommend this film.",1266969600,,896,5.006711409395973
2251920,5,B0007Y8AEC,"I'm a psychology student in CA. We watched this film during my abnormal psychology class when we covered OCD. Let me tell you: it is a very well done film. Not only is it extremely well acted, but it sheds light on disorder that many struggle with. It never makes fun of the people with the disorder like many films do. It sheds light on their situations, their struggles, and their lives in a way that is realistic, touching, and artistic.
I strongly recommend this film you anyone who is thinking about being a psychologist. Anyone with OCD would find this film comforting in its realism, and its positive outlook on life makes it a worth while viewing experience. (Not all movies about mental disorders have positive aspects in them. This film is special in that sense.)
It's a great film. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in OCD or mental disorders.",1236297600,,865,4.660130718954249

2251922,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Dirty Filthy Love, a BBC television movie directed by Adrian Shergold and co-written by Jeff Pope and Ian Puleston-Davies is a superbly played portrayal of life with faulty brain wiring. It is billed by some as a comedy, but that is a misnomer.  In our daily negotiations with spouses, roommates and bosses, there are funny moments and ridiculous interactions and these are seen in the film. But the script doesn't play out for laughs, and the humor arises from the natural foibles of being human. Underneath it all, there is a painful, sad fact: perfectly intelligent, good people have brains that don't work right. It is important to watch this film-- if only to remind us that mental illness is nothing more or less than brain disorders that can treated.

Suffering from a failing marriage, Mark (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Sheen) is awakening to the realization that his day to day rituals are ruling his life. As his anxieties grow, he suffers from increasingly debilitating OCD and tourette. Writer Puleston-Davies, who has OCD and mild Tourette,  draws from his own experience: Mark goes to the doctor and says he has his severe depression narrowed down to ""three things: meningitis, early senile dementia or a brain tumour."" In real life, Puleston-Davies's doctor diagnosed the OCD, and helped him get cognitive behavior therapy. In the film, Mark is simply prescribed and dismissed with anti-depressants. His saving grace comes from co-patient Charlotte (played by the absolutely delicious Shirely Henderson), who educates him, and us, by putting a name to Mark's disorders, and leading him through a weekly support group.

This is an engaging film, one that deals with mental and physical challenges that are both uncomfortable and painful.  Sheen's perfect rendition of Tourette-- ticing that is raw, unseemly, and underscores how well he knows his craft--and OCD are uncanny. The only thing I found disturbing, however, was the portrayal of tourette as an ever-evolving disorder.  In this film, the tourette seemed to come on only after his life was crumbling. In actuality, tourette manifests in early age--roughly about 7 years old or so--the same as when Mark discovered his OCD while playing ball with his mates. It rarely first manifests in adulthood, and it doesn't evolve from one extreme form to another. The initial ticing (his wife asks ""what is wrong with your throat"" as if she never heard it before) is the extent of tourette for many people. He then goes through copraphagia (only a minority of people with Tourette have this), barking, mimicking--the entire gamut. Whether this is for dramatic effect or to somehow show the full extent and severity of Tourette----it still isn't true to the syndrome.

Many famous and successful people have OCD--David Beckham, Justin Timberlake, the movie's author. Their lives are like this movie--not purely comedy, not totally drama, and not fully a love story.  Rather, this is a cautionary tale that if you win the genetic lottery of misfiring brain neurons, it takes genuine compassion and diligence to survive.",1217116800,5,3084,5.129482071713148
2251923,5,B0007Y8AEC,"I don't see many movies I just have to have. But every once in a while one comes along that is outstanding. With a title like 'Dirty filthy love' one could be forgiven for thinking this was a porn movie. Far from it, this movie is acting at its very best. Michael Sheen has the viewer captivated and sharing so many human emotions. Its a clever clever little movie refreshingly different about obsessive compulsive disorder with a comedic slant. Shirley Henderson as only she can do makes it even more addictive watching. When the main character finds out he's not clinically depressed as his Doctor suggests but suffers from O C D and Tourettes syndrome he joins a self help group of fellow sufferer's. Fantastic casting. Its an eye opener as to what these poor people actually think will happen if they perform the simplest of tasks. His obsession with his estranged wife finds him living an existence incongruous with who he once knew himself to be and confronts him with who he really is. This is a fascinating human experience. Its touching, intense, funny, sad, and satisfying. See it!",1215475200,,1091,4.747368421052632
2251924,3,B0007Y8AEC,"Kind of disturbing.  The movie itself is okay if you are not personally affected by somebody with TS.  For me it was too personal as I have a child with TS and it seems ""gloom and doom""  If you do get it and you have a teen with TS, I wouldn't let them watch it.",1214006400,,262,3.727272727272727
2251925,4,B0007Y8AEC,"You saw that title jump off the shelf and you said ""ooohh"". Sorry, no nastiness in that vein. Rats. But what you get is the story of a poor soul tormented by the twin afflictions of Tourette's and OCD(they do stem from the same brain problem evidently) who is trying to get over his divorce. It's alternately comic and tragic as we watch Mark lurch from healing to dementia when he meets Charlotte, a fellow OCD sufferer who coaxes Mark into a self-help group composed of other OCD patients. A real knockout performance by Michael Sheen worthy of higher accolades, but hey, he ain't Tom Hanks and the studio doesn't have enough juice for a big run so this little film will undeservedly go ignored.

What I find hard to believe is why his doctor doesn't notice the nature of his illness and is trying to work the depression angle. I guess perhaps the setting of the film is 1980s? Only then could a doctor not notice obvious obsessive-compulsive symptoms-no one could watch a man have tics and fits plus compulsion and try to throw Paxil at it and send him on his way without nailing the problem now that these diseases are better understood. So, I guess we needed some sort of deux ex machina(an unrealistically oblivious psychiatrist) to move the plot along to have Charlotte be the person who understands him and tries to save him. Well and good; the performances are well worth the mild disbelief.",1186790400,,1400,4.622489959839357
2251926,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Michael Sheen, so good playing Tony Blair in THE QUEEN, is even better here as an architect who goes over the edge as OCD and Tourettes Syndrome tighten their grip on him.  In a last desperate attempt to save his career and his marriage (to Stevie, played by Anastasia Griffith in a sort of combination Kari Matchett-goes-ABBA blonde hauteur), our boy joins a self-help group run by Charlotte (Shirley Henderson), herself a girl with plenty of neurological problems all her own.  The movie is a bit of a mess, earnest, mawkish and nervous all at once, but it rewards attention especially if you like a good love triangle and don't mind some extremely inventive profanity.

The film is a litle bit like THE MIRACLE WORKER, in that our hero Furness is really living life at the extremity of sanity when Charlotte finds him.  He's given up, he's filthy like a pig, he no longer knows how to cope with the detritus of living.  Somehow though she recognizes his big heart and gets him to snap out of it, at least to the extent of cutting his hair, taking a shower, and trying to rejoin the human race.  The scene where she asks everyone on the bus to give her their wet-wipes is hilarious and sad at the same time.  She might as well have asked these poor people to part with their souls, it would have been easier for them to let go.  Why is OCD so involved with cleanliness?  It would take a Mary Douglas to give the picture a full cross cultural anaylsis, but on its own, the growing attraction Charlotte feels for Furness, as he shapes up and begins to resemble his former, mildly handsome self, is quite winning, even though the audience wonders, how can this come to a good end when we know he's still carrying a huge torch for Stevie?

Shirley Henderson's big black wig is like something Cher wore in her ""Sanctuary"" catalogues, but her voice is like liquid honey; in fact it's the same voice Joan Greenwood used to have in the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s, early 50s, like satin on sandpaper.  It is idescribably bewitching, even when she's screaming abuse at Mark.  Henderson has played many great parts in recent UK films, from BRIDGET JONES to TOPSY TURVY to the Harry Potters, but this vehicle is tailormade--it's the kind of part that Audrey Tautou had in AMELIE, except with more grit.  She could have been a household name had this film been promoted properly.  But that's OK, we her adoring fans can keep her to ourselves, a wonderful secret of modern cinema.",1173312000,5,2475,4.557562076749436
2251927,4,B0007Y8AEC,"Finding the humanity and drama behind Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and a condition that has been made light of as much as Tourette's Syndrome has isn't easy, but director Adrian Shergold and writers Jeff Pope and Ian Puleston-Davies have managed the job quite nicely with ""Dirty Filthy Love."" The story of an architect (Michael Sheen) who loses his wife and job due to the severity of his conditions, the film nimbly balances semi-tragic character study, humor, and love story. Yes, you're likely to find yourself laughing, which is fine; it is a comedy, to some extent. However, the film-and thus the viewer-never loses sight of the human beings behind what's happening. It's a credit to everyone involved-especially Sheen and Shirley Henderson, a fellow OCD sufferer who helps him try to right the ship when he hits bottom-that we giggle a lot less than we feel touched by these characters.",1146614400,,899,5.040268456375839
2251928,5,B0007Y8AEC,"Beginning with a smart script by Jeff Pope and Ian Puleston-Davies (the latter a fine actor who happens to be afflicted with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and under the inordinately delicate direction of Adrian Shergold, DIRTY FILTHY LOVE is one of the more sensitive examinations of two challenges that affect the lives of many people thoughout the  world: Tourette's Syndrome (complete with tics and uncontrollable inappropriate outbursts of foul language, noises, shouts), and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (lives complicated by the need for order imposed by the patient's mind as a series of repeated behaviors that protect the person from the terror of living in a chaotic world). Wrongly titled (a title that probably prevents many people from seeing this little miracle of a film) and incorrectly billed as a comedy (which is most certainly not), DIRTY FILTH LOVE  is one of those films that slipped by us all without a theatrical release but now is thankfully available on DVD.  It deserves full attention.

Mark Furness (played with superlative skill by Michael Sheen) is an architect on leave due to his progressive illnesses (see above) and who is first seen in the throes of beginning a trial separation from his beloved wife Stevie (Anastasia Griffith) who can no longer live under the same roof with Mark's 'inexplicable' behavior patterns.  Left alone with the anxiety over his surfacing deterioration from his physical challenges, Mark finds solace with his close friends who also tire of his behavior and insist he seek medical help.  In the waiting room of a deaf-eared doctor Mark 'meets' Charlotte (the astonishingly fine character actor Shirley Henderson) and Charlotte, who happens to suffer from both Obsessive Compulsive Disorder as well as trichotillomania (uncontrolled pulling out hair strands to the point of baldness), senses a man who needs help.  Charlotte tells Mark of a group therapy session for people with similar problems and Mark, out of desperation, joins the group (a fascinating group of actors imbuing their disease states without the least sign of parody).

It is obvious rather early on that Charlotte is attracted to Mark, but Mark's life is one directed toward making himself acceptable to Stevie.  With a powerful confrontation at a very social party Mark realizes he suffers from a disease state he has had since birth and the only one who really cares about his dilemma and understands his turmoil is Charlotte: a strange love affair is finally recognized.

Scripts such as this are all too rare and when brought to the screen with the exceptional acting and direction rendered by this crew they become films that should be required viewing.  In every way these are brilliant performances by Michael Sheen and by Shirley Henderson, yet because the film never received a theatrical release in this country (probably due to the factors mentioned above) it will be ignored by the Oscars.  But awards are only momentary returns for art pieces of this caliber and this one is destined for a long shelf life. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 05",1132876800,10,3096,5.133200795228628

He is excellent as showing the challenges, as well as the hatred and defiance he feels towards his condition. The most touching scene is him trying to make love with the woman he is in love with, and because of one of his conditions (OCD) he is having an incredibly hard time trying to enjoy it - but he wants to enjoy it, quite badly. I can't say enough at the way he is able to bring the audience into his mind, even though the things he says (Tourettes Syndrome) we would cringe at. But we feel for him regardless, and the empthy he makes us feel as he continues to go further and further down into his hole, is done with what only Michael Sheen can convey.
\With the same torment and romanticism that actors can bring, such as Jeremy Irons or Anthony Hopkins, Sheen does a fantastic performance here. It's a shame that it's not more wide known. I am appreciative that Sundance thought it worthy enough to distribute.",1406937600,2,1099,4.527638190954774
