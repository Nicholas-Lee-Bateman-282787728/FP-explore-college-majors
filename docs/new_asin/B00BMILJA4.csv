5647534,4,B00BMILJA4,"Zombie Type: ""Zemons"" (demon zombies); basically fast-walking (they don't really sprint) undead
Outbreak/Apocalypse Phase: Initial outbreak (characters experience the outbreak as it happens)
Sub-genre: Goofy Horror, Dark Comedy

Dead Before Dawn had an awesomely cheesy late 80's/early 90's vibe right from the start that carried the fun all the way to the very end.  I'm a sucker for 80's cheese (hell yeah gimme some cheddar), so throw in some zombies and it's like crack for me.  I had a good time watching this movie.

The first 20 or so minutes were a bit slow, but it's all fun once the stuff hits the fan.  The basic premise involves a group of college kids fighting off the zemon menace.  Main character Casper Galloway (played by ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid's"" Devon Bostick) is the grandson of Horus Galloway (great Scott, he's played by Christopher Lloyd!), the owner of a store called ""Occult Barn.""  When Casper agrees to watch the store while the elder Galloway steps out to grab something, his friends accidentally unleash a curse that turns its victims into ""zemons"" and spreads itself from person-to-person either via eye-contact with Casper and his friends after 10pm or hickeys from the already infected.  But wait!  The zemons can be turned into your personal slaves if you seduce them with a French kiss!  Needless to say, this movie's charm comes from the fact that it doesn't take itself the least bit seriously.

That's all you need to know.  Dead Before Dawn is a bit over-the-top (not insanely crazy, more slapstick and funny than anything), surprisingly funny, cheesy, and fun to watch.  I'm lucky to have found so many enjoyable zombie movies over the past month after years of sifting through random crap on Netflix.

Final Verdict:  Recommended.  Goofy, cheesy, funny, great to watch with a group of friends.  If what I just typed doesn't immediately turn you off, go watch Dead Before Dawn!",1378944000,9,1915,4.934375
5647535,3,B00BMILJA4,"I thought the movie has some laughs and the pacing is okay, but it is definitely B movie status.  The movie goes right to the line of spoof comedy, but doesn't quite cross it. So, I kind of felt like stuck in the middle not knowing.",1378857600,4,232,4.043478260869565
5647536,3,B00BMILJA4,"""Everything we said at the shop is actually happening! Whoever we make eye contact with is gonna kill themselves, then come back as zemons and kill us...via hickeys"" Casper Galloway (Bostick) is a teenager who is very shy and jumpy due to what happened to him as a kid. When his grandfather (Lloyd) asks him to watch his store he is very afraid. After a group of kids from school show up Casper tries to kick them out until an urn breaks, thinking the warnings are a joke they begin to come up with ideas of what a curse would be. Then they realize its not a joke at all. This is a very very funny movie, but it is mainly stupid humor. I really liked it and laughed a lot but I don't think everyone will find it as funny as I did. For example the plot of the movie involves being killed by getting a hickey from a half zombie-half demon. The writing is funny and the acting is good for a movie like this. There really isn't much else to say about this other then if you like movies with humor like Anchorman and Shaun Of The Dead then you will like this as well. Overall, very funny but not for everyone...also hearing Christopher Lloyd say ""Great Scott"" was amazing. I give it a B.",1375056000,9,1182,4.18859649122807

5647568,4,B00BMILJA4,"Dead Before Dawn (2012)
 Sometimes, once in a while, not very often a film provides us with such a sense of fun and good humor that we totally ignore any budget induced flaws.  This one counts right in that category.  What fun I had watching this comedic romp.
 The technical parts of the film are competently done across the board and some of the Zombie make-up and effects are very good.  We know that rarely happens in low budget films.  The actors are all young but seasoned professional with plenty of experience in both film and TV.  (Note, they might be young but they are too old across the board to be the teens that they portray, except for star Devon Bostick who at least looks young.)  The director and the writer work hand in glove as they have on several other projects.  They also produced the movie which makes their bond even tighter.  They also appeared in the cast.  They get along.
 The story makes as much sense as Zombie movies usually make.  The high school kids break an old urn containing a demons soul.  Scoffers, the kids make mock of the curse until their absurd notions become realized in the creation of demon possessed Zombies, or Zemons as the kids call them.  The whole enterprise has the flavor of a live action Scooby Do movie.  We have lots of running around, not very scary action (even not very scary death and other mayhem) and a general silly atmosphere.  But the actors and crew do all this with an enthusiasm and panache that infects the viewer.
 April Mullen directed, produced and acted.  She has a total of six directorial credits.  She has a couple of awards besides the Perron Crystal Award for best live action 3D film that Dead Before Dawn recieved.  That award comes from Belgium.  Co-producer and writer (also actor) Tim Doiron also penned the other films that April Mullen has directed.  Doiron has some 13 acting credits to match the 16 credits that Mullen has accumulated as an actress.  These youngsters, not yet 30, have seen a lot of action and it shows in the quality of this film.
 Starring as Casper Galloway is Devon Bostick, at 23 years of age a seasoned pro with an astonishing 53 acing credits.  Bostick appeared in two George A. Romero films, Survival of the Dead and Land of the Dead so he knows his way around Zombies.  The other cast members, all young Canadians, are pros as well.  Martha MacIsaac , Brittany Allen, Brandon Jay McLaren, and Kyle Schmid all have lots of credits.  These four actors along with Mullen and Doiron play the six high school friends who try to survive the Zemon outbreak.  Well, since they are High School kids, they try to survive and still make time to make eyes at one another.  Both acts they manage with enough charm and innocence that we enjoy watching them.
 This low budget farcical comedy is well enough done that we could give it a fair two and a half brains, but wait.  Somehow the determined young film makers enticed Christopher Lloyd into appearing as the Caspers grandfather, the proprietor of the occult emporium where all the trouble begins.  With the annimatated performance of Christopher Lloyd, the film gets boosted all the way up to three brains.  Lloyd even utters Great Scott for us.
 Dead Before Dawn has an R rating for the usual bloody Zombie bashing (but no gut gobbling), sexual innuendo (but no naked people) and lots of potty mouth language.  It runs one hour and 28 minutes.
 This Canadian Zombie flick was filmed on location at Niagara Falls, Ontario.  This film makes history as the first ever live action Canadian movie filmed in Stereoscopic 3D, much less the first 3D Canadian Zombie film.  Good script, good direction and good Vaudeville style over acting make this one worth watching.
 I liked this light hearted film.  It made me smile.  But it is silly.",1442880000,,3790,4.627627627627628

The trailer looked funny, unfortunately, they're much better at making trailers than actual movies.  Although, since the curse in the movie makes people want to kill themselves, and watching this movie does, in fact, make you want to kill yourself, maybe there's some weird Inception type thing going on here where fantasy plays out in reality and this movie is too brilliant for simple minds to even comprehend.  But I'm leaning more towards it just sucking a lot.",1383436800,,568,5.141304347826087
5647610,4,B00BMILJA4,"If you love horror-comedy like me, then you're always on the lookout for the next SHAUN OF THE DEAD or TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL.  There's just something about combining hilarity with brutality and gore that brings a smile to my face...and not just because it's funny.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of horror, but I also love to laugh.  So when the fine folks at Vivendi announced the release of DEAD BEFORE DAWN, I knew it was a flick that I wanted to check out.  And thankfully, it's just as funny as I hoped it would be.

Before I continue, I do have to admit:  this film is not as funny as SHAUN OF THE DEAD or TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL.  But those are two iconic pieces of cinema that are hard to beat.  DEAD BEFORE DAWN is a great film, though, and is filled with lots of laughs and great gore.  If you're looking for entertainment, then look no further.

DEAD BEFORE DAWN is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  I wish I could have seen it in 3D, as I understand it's pretty spectacular.  But the 2D version is just as fun, I'm sure.

The acting is pretty good, with Devon Bostick heading up a great cast.  I am particularly impressed to note that director April Mullen also starred alongside Bostick as one of the lead female roles.  Mullen is beautiful and talented, a multi-faceted actress and director that I hope to see more of in the future.

The laughs come quick and heartily in DEAD BEFORE DAWN as well.  One of my favorite scenes that made me literally laugh out loud is when the fans and players at the football game all start to kill themselves.  The cheerleaders are kicking themselves in the face, while the football players impale themselves on the line markers.  It is hilarious!

Although DEAD BEFORE DAWN might not be as funny as the prior two films I mentioned, it is still a great flick and one that deserves your attention.  It's chocked full of goofy laughs and grisly gore, so you can't ask for much more in a horror-comedy.  I recommend giving this one a shot.  It is available now in a variety of formats, but I suggest watching it on Blu-ray.  In addition to the great picture and sound, you get a nice bunch of Special Features, including a Behind the Scenes featurette, a Making Of documentary, and a Blooper Reel.",1382572800,3,2259,4.387951807228916

It should come out eventually in the states on blu ray though. It's a true horror masterpiece and people die and become demons in it.  It's on dvd here though , it's such a great movie. THis however is a b movie horror comedy. I enjoyed it though; and the 3d looks awesome..  But if you want the 3d version you much get it from best buy , at the store , in the horror section!

I have a 135 of them on blu ray alone. But some are from Europe and such.  So if you collect 3d films then you want to go down to best buy and buy this.  It's not a great film but it's a fun and silly romp and if you like that sort of thing then you will enjoy this one.

Since they thought it was a joke they came up with a ridiculous curse thus leading to an idiotic movie.  The movie is so idiotic is isn't very funny.  The movie tried too hard to be funny and it flopped in my opinion. I didn't care for the stereotypes the teenagers represented nor did I care much for the acting.  The only reason I am even giving it two stars is because I enjoyed Christopher Lloyd's character.  If you want a funny zombie movie I would recommend Shaun of the Dead, Juan of the Dead, or even Detention of the Dead.

5647613,3,B00BMILJA4,"The teenage kids vs. zombie comedies have become popular and have boasted some success. Some are funnier than others. This is an ""other.""

In this film Casper (Devon Bostick) and his friends break a cursed urn belonging to his grandfather (Christopher Lloyd). The people they look at become suicidal, then turn into demonically possessed zombies called ""zemons"" although they weren't any different than regular zombies. They attack by giving hickies and can be controlled by giving them a French kiss, although these last two aspects were not overly utilized making this a ""me too"" comedy zombie film.

To give you an example of the writing, a funny one-liner from the film: ""I remember my first trophy. Most improved hygiene.""

This is a Canadian production, with all the spice of mayonnaise. The actors did well to deliver their lines, which were hit and miss, with too many falling into the ""miss"" category. The writers did better on the build up to the action than it did during the action.

Recommended as a rental.
