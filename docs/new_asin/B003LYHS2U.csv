4154171,5,B003LYHS2U,"In the interest of truth in packaging , let me admit that I know the colorful fellow who sells socks in the film and that I knew it was going to be made, met the ny times reporter who did it and saw a red paint cap on a fellow in the film that has the name of the lumberyard I once owned on it.  So be it.  The film captures people who have gone through the hell of the concentration camps and built a new life.  Not intellectual or rich or unique people  except for  the elusive  qualities that permitted them to survive.

Perhaps the finest parts of the film are the humorous incidents.

Among the films that treat the Catskills , borsht belt, community, this film stands out.  wonderful.",1315785600,2,690,4.206106870229007
4154172,5,B003LYHS2U,Wow! This DVD may have had a life-changing effect on the rest of my life. Jewish Holocaust survivors spend 25+ years making a family from the ruins of their lives together in a bungalow colony in the Catskill mountains. I do not have the words to describe how life-affirming this documentary is.,1315094400,3,295,4.6923076923076925
4154173,5,B003LYHS2U,"""Four Seasons Lodge"" is an excellent piece of filmmaking that showcases the here and now lives of Holocaust survivors who gather every summer at the lodge in the Catskill Mountains region of New York. Director Andrew Jacobs' first film proves to be a success, partly due to the fact that his cinematographers were led along by the great Albert Mayles whose use of ""cinma vrit"" allowed the cameras to roll while the lodge members, now in their eighties, danced, sang and enjoyed some occasionally bawdy humor. They debate if they should go to court to reverse the sale of the lodge; the majority of the lodge members now want to stay and still go to the lodge every summer despite the fact that their advanced age has most of them quite frail and unable to enjoy themselves as much as they used to.

And there's more. Albert Mayles and the rest of the camera crew use a type of documentary filmmaking called ""cinma vrit."" Cinma vrit doesn't just let the cameras roll; it also employs the use of staged settings so that we can witness on film their meetings to discuss what would happen if the lodge cannot be bought back from the buyers; and there is ample footage of people telling their real-life stories of being in concentration camps like Auschwitz with ""the angel of death,"" the infamous Nazi ""doctor"" named Mengele. We also learn how many of them lost all of their family members in Nazi concentration camps. It's amazing, though, to see just how much they have recovered and formed new families by bonding with the other people up at the lodge every summer; they enjoy life and this is a perspective on Holocaust survivors that we rarely get to see. They have not merely survived the Holocaust; they flourished emotionally, formed friendships that have lasted through the decades and they truly love each other.

Of course I could write more about whether or not the sale of the lodge was ever finally reversed; and there are themes including aging with painful farewells to dear old friends, people passing away and marriages that are highlighted for certain reasons--yet I won't write much more so as not to spoil it for you! Suffice it to say that you will be fascinated as you gain a deep respect and admiration for these fine human beings.

The DVD comes with a few extras. There's a brief featurette by director Andrew Jacobs about making the film; and there are four deleted scenes. There is another featurette entitled ""Poems.""

Overall, ""Four Seasons Lodge"" gives us a rare look at Holocaust survivors in that the primary focus is on the here and now--and the joy these people have in living life and being good, good friends with each other through the years. I highly recommend this film for anyone studying the Holocaust and the survivors of the Holocaust; and people who like heartfelt, poignant documentaries will appreciate this, too.",1313193600,4,2856,4.752016129032258

Every summer for the past few decades, a group of Jewish Holocaust survivors has met at the Four Seasons Lodge in the Catskill Mountains, drawn together by their unwitting participation in the single greatest crime-against-humanity of the modern era.

Though these individuals spend some of their time on camera detailing their harrowing experiences in the death camps, much of the documentary ""Four Seasons Lodge,"" directed by Andrew Jacobs, a writer for ""The New York Times,"" actually focuses on the here and now, on their lives and relationships with one another in the present day.

In fact, in many ways, the movie is less about being a concentration camp survivor than it is about the tragedy and trauma of growing old, of having to say goodbye - to each other, to life, and to the lodge itself, whose fate lies in the hands of this ever-diminishing group of people who are now seriously contemplating selling off their shares in it.

Perhaps the most poignant moment in the movie is the one in which we see, in grainy home movie footage from several decades back, the much younger versions of these same people, all hearty and hale and in the prime of their lives, dancing up a storm and enjoying to the full their time together.  It's a stunning contrast to their condition today.

And, yet, through it all, these brave and spirited survivors - who have experienced and endured far more in their lives than the rest of us could possibly even imagine - have somehow managed to persevere and to make something of their lives.

""Four Seasons Lodge"" is no great shakes as a piece of filmmaking.  It doesn't tug at the heartstrings or provide grand moments of dramatic revelation as one might expect given the emotional intensity of the subject matter.  In fact, the tone of the film is almost defiantly prosaic - a means, perhaps, of showing us just how successfully these people have managed to move on with their lives despite the horrors of the past.  Whatever the goal, the movie provides a time capsule for future generations to study over and ponder.  And to see history written in these lined, wizened faces.",1300665600,5,2127,4.768392370572207
4154175,3,B003LYHS2U,"I normally love documentaries like ""Four Seasons Lodge"" but perhaps I expected too much and found it good but not great. Part of the problem was the inclusion of too many residents: you never feel fully connected to any of them, save for the gentleman who must feed his dementia-stricken wife through a feeding tube. I never fully understood the arrangement of the FSL: do these people own the cabins ? Rent ? Is it only open for 30 days ? The place also looked in serious disrepair, like a serious gust of wind could level everything. But that said, many of the stories are touching without being maudlin. These Seniors are not to be trifled with !",1297468800,,649,4.508474576271187
4154176,5,B003LYHS2U,"This is one of the most touching documentaries I have ever seen.  The people living in the Four Season's lodge are stoic, but absolutely not heartless.  I feel the emotions and I can't imagine what they have seen in their lives.  There is plenty of laughter and also plent of tears.  I'm just glad this movie was made as a testament to these people's survival.",1296864000,4,360,4.492307692307692

8399915,5,B003LYHS2U,"Superb piece of film that gives a rarely if ever seen glimpse into the lives that Holocaust survivors rebuilt as they moved on with their lives. Poignant, touching, a very nostalgic look into the process of growing old as well as living with the memories of the camps.  An amazing story of resilience, hope, and bonding of a group of New York Jews who were very much like the ones I grew up knowing but never really knowing their true heritage and story until later.  A time of beauty, sadness, melancholy and strength needed to push forward in life regardless of the pain one might experience along the way. Every person in this group brought a tear to my eye as I reflected about what they might be feeling inside.  A testimony to human spirit and strength and willingness to go on from life's darkest moments.  As a Professor of Holocaust studies at a college here in Florida I think this film might give my students a new way of looking at the people who did survive the unthinkable cruelty of the Nazi ideologies.  A film not to be missed and to be seen again and again to remind us of the faith some people have.  Thanks for a wonderful story to the filmmaker and the quiet gentle way he told it.",1419984000,,1202,4.391891891891892

This film did more to bring the Holocaust home to me than any other film I've seen on the subject. How anyone could be so cruel is beyond comprehension, and this film really put faces to Holocaust stories. These survivors get together once a year at the Four Seasons Lodge and have fun, tell stories and reminisce. Somehow they were able to survive the war and create lives for themselves afterwards, and it's a great testament to their will to live. L'Chaim.",1349568000,4,610,4.605504587155964
