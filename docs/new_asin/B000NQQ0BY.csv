2777349,3,B000NQQ0BY,"I was very happy to come across this video, as it is very hard to find videos of Odo Sensei doing kata, let alone the entire system. I am very glad that this dvd was put together as a wonderful tribute to a fantastic individual. I had many opportunities to train with Odo Sensei during my ten years in Hawai'i. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was made from a video someone made for themself of Odo Sensei doing kata both inside and outside his dojo in Agena, Okinawa sometime in the mid to late 80s. I have seen this video several times from a copy my instructor owned. Overall I am very excited for the future generations of Okinawa Kenpo (or as it is currently called Ryukyu Hon Kenpo Kobudo) students to be able to watch Odo Sensei performing kata and kobudo.",1186617600,3,778,4.335616438356165

8180643,4,B000NQQ0BY,"The whole system of Okinawa Kenpo as presented by Grand Master Seikichi Odo. What a huge amount of information! Very good,although much old footage. More of a historical record than an instructional video. Well worth purchasing however.",1444435200,,236,5.405405405405405
8180644,5,B000NQQ0BY,It's basically the best film you could have to practice step by step with the Grand Master instructing you.,1439683200,,107,4.684210526315789
8180645,1,B000NQQ0BY,"Poor Video quality, no Kata break down",1430611200,,38,4.571428571428571
8180646,3,B000NQQ0BY,"Was expecting something better. Although to see great masters at work, this looked more like just filming a friend doing kata, not instructional. Still gave it three stars due to the system and karateka.",1422921600,,203,5.0
8180647,4,B000NQQ0BY,"I was standing about 30 yards away when this video was shot.  It was in the grassy area in front of the Foster Field House on Marine Corps Base Okinawa.  While the quality of the video can be questioned, Odo Sensei's energy was amazing since had Heart Surgery just a little while before this video was made.  Besides being of historical importance, learning the kata based on this particular performance would be difficult.  However, if you have been taught the kata, and are not sure if you are doing things correctly then this video is for you.  If you trained with Odo Sama and need refreshment then by all means get if.  If you were not a student of Sensei then buy the video of one of the top Kobudo instructors of the mid to late 20th century.  Again it will help you if you have trained in the kata before and know the nuances of the kata.",1391299200,,846,4.3164556962025316
8180648,5,B000NQQ0BY,I have been involved with martial arts for over 35 years and specifically Okinawan Kempo  the past 10 years and I enjoyed watching this DVD. It has  Grandmaster Seikichi Odo himself performing the majority of the kata's( both open hand and weapons). This is an excellent reference for those who are interested in Okinawan Kempo Karate and Kubudo( weapons).,1374364800,,356,5.016949152542373
8180649,3,B000NQQ0BY,The video quality was not good and you only have one camera angle.  This is not a video to learn by.  If you want to see Grand Master Seikichi Odo there may be better videos.  I will look for other videos because I think this one is not up to the standard I want for the Grand Master.,1334188800,,284,3.8620689655172415
8180650,4,B000NQQ0BY,"The video quality is from the VHS days, but the kata are exactly what every IKKF practitioner needs. There is nothing like seeing all of your kata performed by Odo Sensei himself!",1311033600,,179,4.625
8180651,2,B000NQQ0BY,"While nice to see Master Odo in a video performing the katas, the overall quality of the video makes the DVD difficult to watch.",1231891200,,128,4.375
