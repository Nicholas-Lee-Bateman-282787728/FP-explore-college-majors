7005773,5,B00TEJ9JUK,"I love these workouts! Simple and effective. As a mom of many little ones they are easy enough to do with the kids around, but yet are strengthening and working me well in short period of time. Besides when you can workout at home it makes it easier to find the time since it doesn't involve having to load kids in the car and go out to the gym. I enjoy the online access to the workouts alot but having a DVD is great since I live in an area where internet can be spotty, so this is a great back up and option for lousy internet areas!",1423612800,9,536,3.9722222222222223
7005774,5,B00TEJ9JUK,"This DVD is fantastic! I have a membership to the fit2b website, but I love this because I can take it with me when I travel, or when I'm away from a fast internet connection! HIGHLY recommend!",1423526400,7,193,4.243243243243243

8701344,3,B00TEJ9JUK,More for people struggling physically. Definitely not a work out to get heart rate up.,1462320000,,86,4.8
8701345,5,B00TEJ9JUK,Beth Learn is an amazing woman who has put together routines to help you have tummy safe exercises.  This DVD is great if you cannot subscribe to her fit2b.us page with many more helpful exercise routines.  I highly recommend this.,1457740800,,231,4.75
8701346,5,B00TEJ9JUK,"I can't say enough positive things! Beth is such an amazing, encouraging teacher. These workouts have really changed my posture, health, core strength, and overall feel! I have recommended them to all my friends. This DVD is a great way to still be able to do the workouts without great Internet connection. They play both our DVD players, as well as the computer.",1431302400,,364,4.7936507936507935

8701348,3,B00TEJ9JUK,"This DVD is a great workout, but it does NOT play on a regular TV DVD player, only the computer.  I returned the first one because I thought it was an error, but the second wouldn't play on the regular DVD player either. As long as you have access to a computer with a DVD drive, it's fine.",1430352000,,290,4.0

8701350,5,B00TEJ9JUK,"Huge Fit2B fan here. Workouts are gentle but don't mistake that for easy! They are very effective, healing and uplifting. I highly recommend Fit2b to anyone who will listen. :)",1424217600,,176,4.9
8701351,5,B00TEJ9JUK,"Weighted Warrior and Kickboxing are 2 of my favorite videos on the website.  I'm so glad to see them available to people who need to travel where they won't have internet access or who live in areas with a high internet cost.

The Kickboxing video is my all time favorite. It's short but I feel like I had an amazing workout when I'm done.  It gets my heart-rate up and I'm sweating just a little bit.",1423699200,8,401,4.25
