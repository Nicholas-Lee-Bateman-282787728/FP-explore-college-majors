8205682,5,B000SKUBEM,"Ernie Hawkins is a great teacher.  I now play about half the songs on these DVDs and my ""Gary Davis"" style has evolved to my own fingerpicking style that still clearly has its roots in the master himself.  All of the Hawkins / Davis DVD sets are worth buying and studying.  You may find this stuff isn't easy, but it is worthwhile if you put in the work.",1406937600,,354,4.176470588235294
8205683,5,B000SKUBEM,"Its all here. Great songs, deep soul and a whole lotta guitar. All lovingly explained by Br Hawkins. It's a tribute to his mentor and a gateway for those of us who would like to learn something about the Reverend's style. The tunes range in complexity from songs accessible to beginning pickers to complex pieces where descending bass lines counter rising melody lines. This is aless on you can grown with as a player. You will want to get RGD's Harlem Street Singer CD as a companion to this lesson.  One of the best in the Vestapol catalog.",1387670400,,542,4.530612244897959
8205684,5,B000SKUBEM,"Rev. Gary Davis was one of the great America guitarists of the 20th century and this 4 DVD set is an excellent intro into his style and musical gifts.  The Gospel Guitar of Rev. Gary Davis is sort of a greatest hits package for his inspiring Gospel tunes.  Don't be concerned about learning to play every song on the 4 disks as many feature intricate picking patterns, but you'll learn a lot of great chord combos, riffs, and so on that can aid in your musical growth.

The teacher for this series, Ernie Hawkins, isn't just some guy that learned to play these songs off records.  On the contrary, he was a student of Rev. Davis and spent many hours with the man.  So this is an authentic reproduction of Gary Davis' playing style and technique. I found Ernie to be a personable teacher who knows where the difficult parts are in a song that a student might have trouble with and takes his time explaining those sections in detail.

Highly recommended if you are into early or traditional American acoustic guitar music.  I also  recommend the other Ernie Hawkins' DVDs on Rev. Gary Davis' incursions into blues, ragtime, and miscellaneous instrumentals.",1364688000,,1154,4.678217821782178
8205685,2,B000SKUBEM,"This DVD has some great material to learn. If your chemistry works with the instructor
it may work for you.
My disappointment was with the teacher. The excuse me (wrong note) and rambling was unbearable.
At times I forgot which song he was on because it was so draw out.
After debating if this guy is the real stuff and I am just not getting it, I watched instructions of the same songs by S Grossman. It took me about 15 min to get the concept and play the song.
He is a great instructor.
Lucky I rented this from Netflix which I would advise before buying.",1361577600,,558,4.224299065420561
8205686,5,B000SKUBEM,"Ernie Hawkins does great service to his own memory and reverence for Davis and his own learning from him in almost a tribute instruction DVD of the Reverend's gospel music. His gospel music is great music and one doesn't have to be religious to be able to derive much listening pleasure from them and /or to learn superb finger picking possibilities from Hawkin's offering. One can either learn the tunes or some of them as is ( but most are pretty difficult)or simply become aware of some new ideas, runs, riffs or whatever  to incorporate into uyour pieces of like keys. These ideas become part of one's playing arsenal - as Stefan Grossman might say - of learning and playing other tunes. I've often thought that if Davis played with three or four fingers instead of just the index and thumb his greatness would even be more so.",1330473600,2,831,4.614864864864865
8205687,5,B000SKUBEM,"Obviously most Rev. Davis songs are not for the beginner or newly intermediate player.... but ( yes, for even you!) Ernie Hawkins is your man for learning these *great* songs.

I learned how to play guitar by learning Gary Davis songs. His gospel tunes are among his most profound & fun to play. This dvd clearly shows you how to tackle these precious songs so you can add them to your repertoire. Ernie Hawkins is a great teacher. I know what it's like to take lessons from a really good teacher (I took lessons from Duck Baker weekly for 3 years)  Mr. Hawkins can teach you these songs for a fraction of what private lessons would cost.

These songs are part of my permanent repertoire. If they become part of your repertoire, you will feel so thankful you bought this excellent dvd set.",1290470400,2,789,4.503496503496503
8205688,5,B000SKUBEM,"Another classic from Ernie Hawkins on Rev. Gary Davis.

Not everyone knows the music of Gary Davis, but if you are a fan of the Rev. Gary Davis, or if you are just a fan of the blues and would love to learn some very unique songs and fingerstyle play, this is a terrific opportunity to spend many hours with a master player and teacher.

Hawkins is a gifted teacher who is an expert on the music of Rev. Gary Davis, including many of the lesser known songs.  This collection has some wonderful songs not normally known by many; the early religious songs of Gary Davis.

Hawkins is a low key, patient teacher, who like all skilled teachers, is able to anticipate where his student will struggle.  For this reason, he will slow down at certain points, repeat himself, and bring the student along with great skill.

For the intermediate guitarist, or for the high drive late beginner, this DVD set equals months of great lessons at an incredible value.  Ernie Hawkins also taught the terrific C-A-G-E-D series, helping the student learn the fret board, which is here at Amazon.

This is a very generous teaching, and this will provide the student with many months of ""private lessons"" which would be impossible to afford, should you be able to land one of the country's top teachers for private lessons.

Plan to spend an hour a week or more with the DVD, using the Pause button often, and learn these terrific songs.

Primarly for the Intermediate guitarist (or early Advanced), someone who is late in the Beginner stage who has the drive to push forward, will benefit greatly from Hawkins' teaching.

See Ernie Hawkins' other DVDs for more excellent acoustic blues lessons.

Between his slow, methodical teaching, his easy going personality, terrific selection of songs, and skilled camera work, you are purchasing months of ""personal"" lessons with one of our country's best teachers of acoustic guitar.",1231632000,3,1902,4.818461538461539
8205689,5,B000SKUBEM,"This is my first experience with Ernie Hawkins guitar instruction and I am very impressed on a number of levels. The clips of The Rev are truly inspirational and the respect (almost reverence) of Ernie for his teacher is inspirational as well.  The connection of the teacher, in this case Hawkins, to the music is a powerful component to this DVD set. The care and pace of repeatedly going over every musical detail was, for me, very similar to a personal lesson and enabled me to learn and play while ""watching and pausing"" the video without the necessity of going back to earlier sections again and again. Ernie, obviously, knows this music extremely well and is a Master of this style. Technically, the DVD is outstanding with excellent sound and video. It appears (not sure) that Ernie does the instruction on Rev. Davis' personal guitar! Great stuff.",1224892800,3,855,4.816326530612245
8205690,4,B000SKUBEM,"This dvd set has alot of good things and a few bad things about it. Its basically set up like this; Each dvd has three or four songs taught on it, and each song starts out with footage of the good reverend playing that particular song,(a few songs don't have a vid of the reverend so the teacher earnie hawkins preforms them). Then Earnie sort of goes through the song start to finish blurting out chords and fingerings and ramblings in-between. Then he plays the song through slowly on a split-screen so you can see what bolth his hands are doing,(On the longer songs he will go through half, then split screen it, then go through the other half and end with another slowed down split-screen version.) Also there is a full tab book with tab and standard notation for each sond along with chords, lyrics and pictures of the great reverend. So here are the bad things about this dvd set:

-Earnie hawkins is sort of a puss,(but he was one of the reverneds students)
-Sometimes the teaching part before the slowed down split screen preformance if sort of jumbled and hard to follow.
-If He,(earnie hawkins) taught a little faster and rambled a little less they probally coud have fit all this on two discs and lowered the price.
-He tends to speed up twards the end of the ""slowed down"" split screen preformance.
-The Reverend played with one finger and a thumb so you two finger-thunb pickers might find that confuseing/frustrateing.
-Some of these songs are soo black they are almost impossible for white man to learn.

What i did for the songs that were sort of taught jumbled was I skiped to the split-screen segment right after and whiped out the tab book and learned from the slowed down split-screen while useing the tab for reference. And if you fingerpick with two fingers and a thumb like i do there shoud be no problem translateing the revends one finger thumb stlye to acomedate your style. Overall this set is for you if you want to learn the beautiful and complex style and song of the late great revend Davis.",1198454400,2,2022,4.567493112947658
