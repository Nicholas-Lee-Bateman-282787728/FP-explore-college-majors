7874573,4,6304551541,"this latest Laura Gemser soft-core flick has all the elements of her previous films. there's nudity, violence, lesbianism, teasing, and so much bizarre situations and plot twists it would make the average viewer somewhat dizzy. in this film, we see Gemser playing a reporter who poses as a prostitute in order to get put in prison and experience all the rumors about violence and amoral prison guards. once put in prison, Gemser has one confrontation after another. the warden and her underlings get their kicks watching women get beat up with billy clubs and there's one scene in the film where just the sounds of two women having sex prompt two female cell-mates to give in to their desires. the overall plot is borderline soap opera with the emphasis on over-emotional turmoil and writhing bodies. there's only two scenes in the film that would qualify as a ""sex scene"", all other segments are nudity and teasers. however, there is a doctor who at first comes across as just another sleazeball but he turns out to be a normal guy locked up for killing his wife (her wish) but his knowledge of medicine is how he was appointed the prison's doctor. after his second appearance, we start to see that he's going to help Gemser escape the prison dead or alive. this is a great ""atmosphere"" film and one that will haunt you for weeks and months because the violence is so horrific. the film lacks character development for the authority figures, who appear in this film as nothing more than sadistic, twisted rapists. maybe that was the goal? maybe the film was designed to expose the hypocrisy of prison guards and how the guards act all self-righteous but as soon as the lights go out they're just as despicible as the criminals? whatever the case, i gave it 4 stars for the simple fact of the guard's and warden's lack of humanity.",1044748800,18,1831,4.6894409937888195
