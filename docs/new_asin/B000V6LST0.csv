2931244,4,B000V6LST0,"I've been using the Digital Video Essentials DVD to calibrate my TVs for quite a few years and I've always loved the results, so when I heard that a Blu-Ray edition was coming, I was ecstatic.

Well, now that I've got it, it still does an excellent job, but for owners of the DVD edition, you're really not getting anything new. Almost everything on here is directly from the original DVD, only remastered in 1080p. There are a few things that have been added that pertain to LCD technology and explanation of the HD color standards, but the vast majority of content is exactly the same as the DVD.

The one thing that is a definite improvement over the DVD edition is the menu system. Instead of being forced to fast-forward through explanations to get to the test patterns, now you can bring up the pop-up menu and select a test pattern directly. So, once you've learned how to use the test patterns, you don't have to watch the explanations again in order to get to them.

So, if your Blu-Ray budget is a little short and you already own the DVD edition, then I'd say just stick with what you've got. After calibrating my TV again with the new Blu-Ray edition, I ended up with the exact same settings that I achieved with the DVD, so in that respect, you're not going to get a more enhanced calibration with the Blu-Ray edition. Apart from that, I'd say its worth it just for the improved menu system, if you don't mind re-purchasing basically the same thing over again.

If you don't own the DVD, I'd say buy this immediately, but don't let the ""HD Basics"" tagline fool you. This can be pretty technical if you've never used a disc like this before. Just take your time, watch all the intro videos (and there's a lot to the intros), and you should be fine.",1206748800,404,1760,4.439628482972136
2931245,3,B000V6LST0,"I've never owned a DVE calibration disc. Before this disc, I used to use AVIA to calibrate my TV. My TV is a Sony 32S3000, and it is connected via HDMI to a PS3, which I used as my BD player.

Opening the HD Basics case reveals three color filters all in one single item. This is great compared to AVIA. Lift the paper holder up and move you head up or down depending on the filter you want. And the paper holder itself is a tool to check the grayscale. AWSOME INCLUSION!

The HD Basics BD starts by giving you a crippled menu, but with a question: Where would you like to start? The question was a good start, but the execution reveals that they didn't even put thought into the menu:

COMPLETE PROGRAM MENU - Self explanatory.
HD IN DETAIL - Video shows how to setup Environment, Audio, and Video (more descriptions of Video things like scan-lines, color quality, etc).
SETTING UP MY HDTV - Video shows how to use Basic Test Patterns.
JUST THE TEST PATTERNS - Basic Test Patterns.

The three lower items act like short-cuts to items in the Complete Program Menu. I don't like this menu because it's so annoying to get back into it and because the title of each item is very vague. ""HD In Detail"" - How vague is that? ""Setting Up My HDTV"" - Do you mean how to connect the wires to it? Also, having the Complete Program Menu at the top sort of contradicts their efforts to make it simple. Instead it should have been last, and called Advanced Menu or some crap similar crap that would've kept the average Joe from venturing in there.

Once you enter an item you cannot return to this menu unless you press the Top Menu button on your controller, which shows a loading screen. When you enter an item, you can press Back to go to the Complete Program menu:

INTRO TO HD - Video shows why we need to calibrate, new technologies and CRT matching, how wide color gamut sucks (possible shot at Sony?), and video compression.
HD IN DETAIL - Video shows how to setup Environment, Audio, and Video (more descriptions of Video things like scan-lines, color quality, etc).
HD VIDEO CALIBRATION - Known as Setting Up My HDTV in the top menu, this video shows how to use Basic Test Patterns.
BASIC VIDEO SETUP PATTERNS - Known as Just The Test Patterns in the top menu, this item shows the Basic Test Patterns.
AUDIO TEST SIGNALS - Self explanatory.
ADVANCED VIDEO TEST PATTERNS - More test patterns. Allows the option of 1080p or 720p. Doesn't seem useful to me.
DEMONSTRATION MATERIALS - Some videos to look at for viewing HD picture.  Allows the option of 1080p or 720p. Narration by Joe Kane is also an option, but only in 1080p.
CREDITS - Shows who you should complain about if you dislike the BD.

Alot of the information on the 90 minutes worth of videos can get very technical and is not important to calibration or to the average Joe. The narrator sounds monotonous and throws in a few, really stupid jokes. It can also seem repetitive sometimes because every time he refers back to something he repeats that something almost entirely. It also sounds like a rant sometimes as the Narrator tends to sound disgusted with certain practices of HDTV manufacturers and goes on to say the beliefs of JKP.
There are also no titles to each chapter of video and very little emphasis is place on calibration information that is mixed in with all the other technical information. So I watched everything and picked out the information that I thought was important, but it doesn't mean I couldn't have missed something.

None of the of the Video Test Patterns allow you to calibrate Tint. How did they miss that and why? They went in so much detail on everything else.

The Navigation Menu is similar to the HD DVD menu, if you're familiar with it, but isn't as easy to navigate through. When you enter a menu item, a chapter selection thing shows up. What sucks about this is that to select the next chapter, which is below the current one, you need to press Up instead of Down. Then if you want to get back to the Complete Program Menu, there is no item to do so. You have to figure out to press Back. In only three menu items is there the selection to go Back. This is inconsistent and isn't intuitive.

Every Menu item has a description of it on the right of it that tries to describe in more detail what the item does, or how to use the test pattern if the item is for one. However, it fails. It's too verbose and not simple enough for the average Joe to understand what to do with it properly. It is also shown in too small font.

I also found a bug. While look at a test pattern, if I press the Menu button, the image becomes cropped. I fixed this by going back to the Top Menu. It's happened to me twice so far. This is obviously something that can get very annoying and is the true testament of how much work JKP put into this BD.

DVE HD Basics isn't as easy as they say it is to navigate and understand the full use of video patterns. However, JKP do provide the nice color filter item and there are true HD color patterns here unlike SD calibration discs. If you're an enthusiast, you may also find some of the technical information fun to know. My main complaint is that they could've made it so much easier to use by using common sense. It's just plain ridiculous the mistakes that they made in this edition.

UPDATE: I just remembered, from AVIA, how to adjust the TINT control. Use the blue filter on the pattern used to adjust color. Make sure all the blue boxes are an equal shade of blue.

UPDATE 2: If you already have a calibration disc, you won't benefit much from buying this disc. It only made a slight difference in my color and sharpness settings.",1206489600,228,5656,4.38872970391595

2931289,3,B000V6LST0,"My choice came down to either buying this highly recommended product, investing in a blu ray burner to burn a disc with the free option out there, or go all out with hundreds of dollars spent on alternatives which includes those special meters designed for calibration. Well, since my current TV is a few years old I decided to go the cheapest, easiest route and consider the high end methods later with a new TV purchase.

At 30 bucks on sale, I see even the cheapest route is cashing in on those that are alittle more tech savy and wish to better their viewing experience. I mean damn, I can buy movies at 10 bucks that cost infinitely more to create than what investment went into this product. If the free route didn't require an investment into a blu ray burner for your PC and blu ray discs to burn, which isn't overly expensive but still a good $100 bucks or so, this here would probably never sell to anyone in the HD era ever again. Most of this content is in regards to decades old technologies. I guess they really did do a copy/paste job from the dvd version for the most part. The test patterns are fine, but this disc does not delve into newer technology and tv settings like backlighting, tint(not new whatsoever), or color temperature, though color temp was briefly mentioned that adjusting it won't effect the calibration of the gray scale(I believe)

Don't get me wrong, this is as good as the next thing if you just want a quickie cal job to get the black/white levels and basic color calibrations in a better working order than it comes in the box, combined with research online for any possible settings for color temp, but don't expect perfection. The test patterns will work best with professional equipment designed for this like those meters, or so they say. But let's be real here: Most people are buying this to skip spending hundreds of dollars. In that case, it works just okay.

But I still give this product 3 stars out of spite that it's no longer relevant in 2015. I get it. You create a product and you're not doing the yearly update thing, so that product stays out there in the market for ten years, give or take 5 years. But I can only rate it in the now and how it performed for me in the now, and this product here was less than stellar for me. I think a 3 star is fair. An updated effort for newer TVs and their settings, with more explanation about them than a passing reference about ""playing with the settings until you like what you see"" would up this to a 5 star, I am certain. I don't want to be told to play with it til i like what I see, I bought this damn thing to calibrate my TV to it's correct settings. Whether I like it or not is meaningless. I want it to be accurate, THEN if I want to be dumb I'll play with the settings to what I ""like"".

Right now after using this disc, and assuming with not much reason to think otherwise that it did it's job correctly for black/white/color calibration, with color temp set to normal, I feel that color is still off being given away by skin tones, and it won't be fixed until I mess with the color/tint/color rgb temp settings. I can get the blue and red to supposed correct status with the included filter DVE provides, but green is still off. I am hoping that if I am able to get all three to correct status, my color will be calibrated as correct as it can be with the naked eye. I believe delving into the color temp RGB settings to change the brightness levels of the colors will accomplish this. The problem is, those settings are almost exclusively for machines i.e. meters. You have little hope of getting it right imho as the average tech savy Joe without aid. With a quick search I found RGB settings done on a 55 inche vizio model(done with a meter I believe), and it did wonders for correcting skin tones. Problem is it's a different TV from mine so I know I can't just accept it and move on. Overall the changes makes everything appear overly vibrant on my set. Perhaps I just can't know that for sure, and it's actually more accurate than I realize, but I'll see....

The real problem here are a-holes who don't calibrate their TVs correctly before they sell them to the consumers. If they would include just one setting among all of the other crap, with that setting being called ""100% accurate true to life and exactly how content makers intended for you to see it setting"" then we would never need calibration done ever again. Sometimes they make a quickie effort and call it accurate or normal or whatever, but it's a quickie and by no means accurate. If you can't take the time to do this for TVs you want to sell for thousands of dollars to us, I don't like you very much.

Anyway I'm done here. Most part it was a waste of time but if it helps anyone these days, good deal. Just remember, if you buy something for say 2 grand like I will on my next set, do yourself a favor and get it professionally calibrated, whether that is paying someone or investing in it yourself on software and hardware meters. Don't spend thousands of dollars and then buy this disc and call it a day. It's an injustice to yourself. Everyone else who spends under 1k and not much more than 1k, just get this disc and be happy or invest in equipment and use it in the now and use it again in the future, and don't pay someone to do it. That's my best advice. Consider free route with blu ray burner investment if you want. It's just as expensive as the burner and discs you buy. It's probably better than this product here.",1421539200,2,5514,4.333010648596321

However, went I wanted to re-calibrate, I only needed the patterns but with a quick explanation. You get all the patterns with a long explanation (which is great for first timers) and you get just the patterns by themselves. (suited for the experts/installers). However, for the homeowner who knows the basic but need a little refresh of the settings, like a short step by step, it doesn't have it, so it was kind of of annoying the second and third time around.

It also has speaker layouts and sound calibration if you have an SPL meter. I don't do  I rely in my Yamaha's YPAO and some manual adjustments later.

Really?
When I finally found the actual calibration chapters, things at first seemed very promising. Starting with brightness adjustment, the instructions were good, the test screen was good, and a ""pause"" icon was displayed telling me to pause the video and make the adjustment. Good enough.

It is difficult to use, overly verbose about topics that have nothing to do with actual calibration of your TV, and contains no specific instructions on what to look for when using the test patterns. There is a lot of narration re: the history of TV, how manufacturers try to lure customers, how current standards don't produce a proper calibration (in the opinion of the DVD's authors), etc. On top of everything else: if you buy this you are stuck with it. The seller does not accept returns nor issue refunds for opened items. I know, I tried.

As for specific complaints: The test patterns you use for the actual calibration are in separate chapters from the chapter which (briefly) describes their use. There is no narration, nor graphics to explain the test patterns themselves forcing you to go back to the chapter which describes their use. Even that chapter is lacking in clarity. I never really understood how dark the room should be before beginning the calibration, how the graduated bars worked, what constituted a properly adjusted result, or how the color filters worked. After multiple adjustments that I thought met the results for color settings I found the resultant picture way too red. When I turned down the color intensity to make flesh tones appear more natural the calibration filters indicated the colors were way off.

THEY DON'T mention anything about adjusting THE TINT, JUST THE COLOR
 - I had to look it up online how to adjust the tint with the color patterns, because they say nothing about it (stupid considering the amount of detail given on the other controls)

2931340,3,B000V6LST0,"Short version:
Good info for the novice, more experienced folks will not get as much out of it.  Decent patterns with a wonky interface.  There are better options that are FREE, especially if you are going to use a colormeter and a program like calman.

Not recommended unless you are new to home theater and want to learn more about SMPTE standards and why you need calibration.

Long version:

The DVE HD basics disc is a calibration disc for HDTVs.  They have patterns designed to be used by eye and patterns to be used with equipment.

Using this by eye will make a difference to your tv.  Most tvs are grossly inaccurate out of the box and must be calibrated to more closely follow SMPTE specs.  Calibration by eye with this disc is easy to follow and reasonable for what it is.  Calibration by eye is never really all that accurate, maybe a pro with lots of experience can get close but most people aren't going to be able to tell how a blue primary should look as opposed to one that's a few shades off.

Lots of good info especially for the novice who is getting into home theater.  Has audio and video calibration tests.

Outside of the info sections, I find it a bit hard to recommend this when there are free test patterns from avs forums that are designed specifically to follow the calman, hcfr and other calibration programs.  The free AVS HD709 disc from avs forums was much easier to use with colorHCFR, this disc also has colored windows (DVE does not) for color calibration of primaries and secondaries, it has the checkerboard ANSI pattern for contrast which DVE does not, and has APL patterns more suitable for plasma tvs (again DVE only has windows and fields but no APL).

If you aren't going to have your tv professionally calibrated, and you aren't going to buy a colormeter and use a program like calman to calibrate this might be a decent disc to use.  The info is good but the navigation is weird, when you press the down arrow you actually select the next option ABOVE the one you are on.  It's like the menu buttons are on a wheel and pushing down rotates the wheel downwards instead of moves the arrow down.",1327017600,2,2137,4.48062015503876

There are some nice informal videos, but there are really no clear directions on what to do with the test patterns, which left me guessing and not so sure of what I was doing on a lot of them. To be fair, I guess I didn't spend too much time trying to figure everything out. Maybe if I spend a few hours one day, I'll get a better idea of how to do everything properly, but the setup is certainly not very user friendly.

With that being said, as I mentioned already, this is probably a great tool for people who know what they are doing. For the rest of us though, not so much.",1324425600,,877,4.189349112426036

Based on CNET's advice, both are good for beginner to intermediate would-be calibrators. Though I am a beginner, I like to tinker and don't want to be limited, so I went with the DVE HD Basics BluRay. It is excellent and comprehensive. Indeed, it is too comprehensive for me. Unless you purchase TV calibration software and hardware (which I may do in the future, but not now), you cannot use much of the test material. I think that most customers will be more than satisfied with the Disney disc (which I've heard is more user friendly), and were I to make the purchase again, I'd probably get the Disney disc (and I'm pretty picky).

Nevertheless, there are plenty of test signals, for both video and audio (this isn't as clearly advertised), and as long as you are willing to put some effort into it, it will help you get great picture and sound from your home theater system. It includes test signals for 1080p and 720p resolution, and includes 24 and 60fps content. The disc includes plenty of instructional voice over, as well as a general overview of HD technology. It also includes the RGB filter to help you dial in your colors just right.

Once I bought it (like three years ago at Circuit City) I noticed that it didn't look as good as some of the store display models that had been calibrated. I noticed at the store they were showing The Hulk and it looked awesome, so I bought the same movie to try to make it look as good. I got pretty close, and I was happy with that. I recently realized it didn't look as good as I thought it should, so I bought this disc. Worst. Idea. Ever.

This disc is so boring, so ineffective, so lame that I feel someone owes me my $19 back. I followed the (lame, boring) steps and the tv doesn't look much better. My next step is sit down and watch a newer movie and calibrate myself like I did the first time around.

2931360,1,B000V6LST0,"This product is a good start to adjusting your monitor, but that's all.  It goes into great detail explaining about viewing and listening environments but when it comes down to actually adjusting your picture, it falls flat.  Theoretically, when you look at the appropriate test pattern and adjust the contrast, you will see where the whites ""clip"" (where they lose detail) and then you set the contrast just below that point.  On my new 1080P Samsung, it never reached that point.

Then there is the ""backlight"" adjustment on my monitor.  This disc never addresses that issue, so I still don't know how to adjust it, or even what it is!

You are provided with color filters to adjust the ""color"" setting on your monitor, but ""tint"" is never discussed.

I work in a video post production facility, overseeing the color on hundreds of feature films.  While I never expected my home picture to rival a $40,000 monitor, I had at least hoped to get it in the ballpark,  After three hours with this product, I'm still hoping.

Another feature that I find particularly distracting, is that the coloring of the actual actors and sets used in the disc, is all over the map!  Some actors have magenta skin tones, yet the grey walls in the background have a green cast to them.  After setting up my set using the colored filters, the skin tones of all the people on this disc are too saturated,  and some are magenta, others magenta/blue.

I would have hoped that whomever compiled this material would at least have an eye for color!  One of the first things they need to do when they remaster this disc is to color correct it, scene-by-scene.

From what I've read, the only other disc that purports to help you adjust the setting on your tv is unavailable, so this appears to be your only choice,  All I can suggest is that you buy it used or on sale, which should be easy, since nobody is going to want this in their permanent blu ray collection.",1294272000,3,1938,4.554913294797688

Discrepances between WOW's Basic and Advanced Brightness and Contrast settings.
As LG's Brightness goes above 52, Blacks start to take on a Milkiness.
As Tint goes away from 0, colourations start to look pastie.
Sharpness and Backlight were the same. There's actually no test on any of the disks
for Backlight. 40 was the end result of the Calman 4.1.1 calibration testing.
Expert 1 was used, and was previously calibrated with Calman, Chroma5 Profiled from the i1Pro
to meet industry standards. Also in the circuit is the iScan Duo VE.

Now that I've found which of the 3 calibration DVDs I prefer, will now recalibrate THX using the S&M's results.

Previous values used for Original Expert 1 calibration: BL: 40, CT: 90, BR: 52, SH: 52, SV: 54, CL: 50, TN: 0

After calibrating with Spears and Munsil, Calman 4.1.1, i1Pro (Using LCD Standard View), then finalizing using the iScan Duo, plus a further fine tuning with the S&M again, the resulting PQ was the Best I've ever witnessed on this set! The final settings ended with changes to the Backlight: 46 and Colour: 42.  Also calibrated the wife's LG 55LHX, with the same great PQ when finished.

Its helpful if you have a strong background in screen adjustments such as having a background in photography or other graphic production where color correction is a factor.

The most useful way to use this disc is to also aquire a good quality meter for checking luminance etc.  If you aren't going to constantly be updating your color settings or if you are not going to go into business doing this, you might be better served by having someone come to your house to do this for you.

I have the xrite i1 light sensor for calibrating monitors etc and have used this with HFCR software to calibrate my high def screen.  It does a very good job.  Without the light meter, I would say the results I got from using the DVE disc alone with the tutorial included on the disc was mediocre at best.

I just wanted to get the brightness and contrast set ""correctly"" to see what should be the reasonably best picture I can.  The instructions and tests on the disc aren't much to speak of. The instructions have a lot more to do with how TV's should be able to fix the color problems but often don't rather than saying... ""look at this test pattern"" adjust ""this setting"" to get ""that"" result.  There's a ton of test patterns included which have no instructions at all.

Calibrating your TV is not the most complicated activity in the world, but it does require a somewhat in-depth understanding of the production process and theory.  A very important thing to know going in, is that a great number of TVs will never be able to reach a ""perfect"" calibration.  It's simply beyond the capabilities of the television.  So, the more you know and understand, the better you can choose which areas to compromise on to achieve the best picture you can get from your individual set.

It may be boring, but watch all the material on the disk and try to pay attention.  If you can't understand the concepts...  well I don't know what to tell you, maybe grab that geek buddy (everyone has one) and have them check it out with you.  There's no getting around the fact that you're going to have to tangle with, and come to grips with, some semi-complicated technical information to get the best results.

The disk doesn't go into great depth concerning the various devices that the disk may be played through, and what those devices may be doing to the incoming signal to the TV.  You will need to check out an AV forum for the best way to optimize your player.  If you are using a PS3 as a blu-ray player, check out ""optimizing your ps3 for BD"" on youtube.  It will show you all the settings you need for that device.

Neither does DVE get into all the noise reduction, active back light controls, cinema motion etc... available on most sets.  Some may consider this a negative, but I view it as DVE being realistic about the fact that there is no way for a relatively  universal disk to cover this.  There is no industry standard for these controls.  What they do or how they do it is all on the manufacturer, and even varies within a makers own line up or in the same model from year to year. As a general rule simply turn off any of these settings, or set to the lowest possible setting.  They are almost all techniques for altering the basic information of the incoming picture in one manner or the other.

Does it take two hours to go through?  Well yes I suppose it does.  But, did you just drop a grand or more on a new TV?  Doesn't two hours and [...] seem like a small price to get the most out of that investment?  I've used it on both TVs in my house, my in-laws, and several friends sets.  They've all been ecstatic with the results.  If you're patient and take you time, I think you will be too.",1282089600,10,2627,4.4004149377593365

Anyway, I had long been considering this disc but never got around to it, only now I just got a new plasma set and wanted to calibrate everything.

For the brightness and contrast tutorials, I did fine.  I had to rewind once or twice to hear the instructions again, but generally it was clear what I needed to do.  After that, however, I found the tutorial fell apart.  I'm not sure what I was supposed to do with the color filter, I'm not sure what I can really do about my TV's aspect ratio (they're all preset), and the geometrical grid seemed to have no application or purpose whatsoever.  I fooled around with some other items but on the whole felt lost and confused.  Worse, I don't feel like I really did much to calibrate my set.  I kept getting the feeling that I was missing a prompt to do something, only when I rewound I did not find the prompt I was expecting.

i read some other review that said that it doesn't seem to address some of the advanced features some tvs come with nowadays, and i have to agree. there are still several settings on my tv that make an obvious visual difference and are not covered by in the program. i don't know enough about these things to know if they should have been included, but it would have been nice.  also, it doesn't seem to take advantage of being on blu-ray. again, i don't know much about these things, but i felt like it could've easily bought the dvd version and gotten the same results. there's not much about resolution that would leave me to believe that it had to be on blu-ray.

Its very long and boring, too much blah blah blah like I'm in history class, just get to the point because we live in the NOW, not the past when it comes to televisions.  Doesn't inform you when you should make the changes and doesn't clearly let you know if you are calibrating your set properly.  It uses lingo and explanations that are not in lamen terms for the average end user.  If I were an engineer for building flat screens or an ISF pro I would understand, but they make it pretty painful.  I was confused because they start getting into the calibration part, but at the same time started talking about CRT monitors and the correct way it should be adjusted.  I don't care about no CRT displays, I think for the most part anyone who would purchase this BD/DVD would have a flat panel.  They don't even tell you if the calibration portion has started or if its still in the tutorial mode, which is rather annoying, it just moves right onto the next calibration.

So I went on and started tinkering with my Samsung LN52A860 like 3 times through.  All the factory settings in the standard and dynamic modes were all within 2-3% range as far as Brightness, Contrast, Color, & Sharpness go, so I didn't even want to bother with calibrating in the other modes such as cinema (under E. Mode).  So no significant difference whatsoever for wasting 97 minutes of my time.  I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this for Samsung LCD owners of 6-Series or up.

I bought a Sony KDL-32XBR6. Equipments started to stack higher and higher... After a while, instead of hiring  professionals to calibrate my TV, I bought this disk (Blu Ray format) to calibrate the settings myself.

The contents of this disk is kind of lengthy and most things are for first timers about explaining what are the testing patterns for. I do not have problem of these explanations. What I really need are those calibration patterns and the filters to help me set up brightness, and colors correctly. I spent about 2 weeks to tweak different settings, and finally got a setting that WAS ""as close as"" to perfect (as explained in this disk), and colors seen thru these filters of this disk: perfect blue, red patterns, green is off just a little bit. So I was happy about this disk and the ability it provides. BINGO! However,...

Since I am a part-time photographer, one day, I took my set of filters (all of them are top notch pro-graded filters: B+W and Hasselblad ones), and tried to compare the filters coming from this disk and my B+W filters (number 25, 47, 58: filter number codes for red, blue green)... Guess what: the most important blue filter comes from this disk is WAY WAY OFF!

If you decided to purchase this disk to calibrate your TV, my suggestion is: please buy a set of digital camera filters (Tiffen ones are good enough) and throw the filters in this box off! Or, you can try to use the calibration patterns from any Sony BD movies.

When compared to the ""AVIA Guide to Home Theater"" DVD, it's a toss up. The color calibration filters were sturdier and easier to handle than the ones provided by the AVIA DVD. I have a 720p TV, and for some odd reason some of the 720p test patterns wouldn't load on my Panasonic blu-ray player (it hanged without showing the test pattern). The 1080p patterns still worked.

The AVIA DVD was much better with the audio calibration basics and suggestions, since the AVIA disc mentioned where to get the audio calibration device, and even without it, the AVIA disc better diagnosed miswirings.

That was a mistake. (Although I have never calibrated a TV before, I'm not someone who is technologically challenged; I'm an electronics engineer with over 40 years experience designing computers and other digital equipment.)

The disk does have dozens of various test patterns. What it doesn't have is much of any information on how to use them. For a start, there are no written instructions whatsoever - no printed manual, no PDF file one can read and print out, nothing even on Video Essentials' website that one might download, and no written explanations while watching the video. What limited instructions there are, such as for adjusting brightness and contrast, are all oral. This means one has to watch an explanation, then when the test pattern comes on try to remember exactly how one is to use it. This often entails backing up a bit and watching the video a second or ever third time; not an very efficient way to get the information across. For other tests, such as setting color and pixel phase, the video never explains exactly what one should see when the set is properly adjusted. I think I ultimately figured these out, but I'm not sure. The disk does have a lot of detail that is of little or no value to the user, such as explanations of why Video Essentials' PLUGE and SMPTE test patterns are better than the standard PLUGE and SMPTE patterns. However, it never explains what a PLUGE or SMPTE test pattern is; it just assumes the user is familiar with these terms.

In summary, if you are familiar with calibrating TVs and know how to use the myriad test patterns with little or no help, this is probably a very good disk. But if this is your first experience in calibration there must be more user-friendly disks available.",1237593600,4,1914,4.659763313609467
2931463,1,B000V6LST0,"As an electrical engineer and a real HDTV enthusiast I was hoping for a number of useful tests to set up my high definition TV by EYE. This test disk failed miserably! I should note that my work experience has NOT been with video and engineers who have worked in the field may find this disk more useful.

I own a top rated 2008 plasma, connected with HDMI cables and I used a Sony PS3 for playback of this disk.

I'm at a complete loss to understand any of the positive reviews* (*see my conclusion).

Here are a few of the many flaws evident on this calibration disk:

1.) There is an exceedingly long and sophomoric explanation of the compromises made as television evolved from standard definition to high definition and the marketing techniques used to make an HDTV more appealing in a showroom. This is not only a major irritant - this material takes up the bulk of the disk.

2.) Where the disk really fails is in its tests. That's right - it won't help you to set up your TV. The explanations of how to use the tests are either hopelessly incomplete or more often - just missing! I find it absolutely amazing that this video has NO explanations for MOST of its tests. Not a single word!! Not a single word about how to use most of the tests is evident in the video, or in the manual or on-line, at the company's web site.

For example: Key factors like setting brightness and contrast are hopelessly confused or incomplete. After a a bit of searching on the web I was able to understand the usefulness of the ""below black"" signal on this disk. It turns out that ""below black"" is a test signal only useful for calibrating a TV but in your final calibration you don't want this signal visible. ""Below black"" picture information does not exist on any commercial DVD or Blu-ray other than a test disk. Trust me - the information I just presented is far more useful and clearer than what you'll find on the disk!  Also, no mention was made that your blu-ray player has to be set up to pass this signal. While I was fortunate that I knew this ahead of time,  there was not one word of warning to the user, let alone information in how to set up your blu-ray player to pass this signal. Of course if your blu-ray player is not set up correctly you render the test completely invalid. What a reader needs to understand is the test pattern provides various black bars and if the below black signal is missing - a person is not likely to know that it is missing! Even worse was there was no mention that all your room lighting should be turned off to achieve any meaningful results. Fortunately I knew that too. That is  a ""best case"" review of one of the few tests that had an explanation.

Most of the tests have NO INFORMATION about how to use them. Unbelievable!!!!

3.) Some of the sample high definition pictures on this disk, which are included to promote the high quality of HD, have excessive noise. Unbelievable! I was very concerned how poorly some of these clips looked. Only briefly and NOT when these images were first displayed was there a mention by the narrator that this noise was due to flaws/limitations of the (vintage) digital camera used (remember this disk was produced in 2000/2001). In short, any big box store will have better high definition content playing!

4.) The menus are confusing and their titles change. The text that appears on the screen is so small that even on a 60"" HDTV I had to get up from my seating position and move closer to read it

This disk had the potential to do a lot but it fails miserably. The disk was made circa 2001 and it clearly shows its roots in CRTs and Projector systems. For example: There is no help whatsoever in setting up the back light of an LCD. That is a key adjustment for adjusting the black level previously discussed.

I hoped to learn more at the company's web site and thought, maybe, I'd still be able to extract some utility from this disk. I could not have been more wrong. There were no technical discussions or anything that a user would find helpful. In fact, the overall scarcity of information was amazing. No forums, tech discussions, or help. Even more telling was there was NO contact information. Once you've bought this disk you are on your own and the authors clearly don't want to hear from you.

Quite honestly - save your money. If someone thinks this disk helps them I'm afraid they are very wrong unless they are far more sophisticated than I am and have extensive technical experience in how to use these test signals and, of course, have the needed instruments. I have no doubt that the test signals were generated with some care. But the question is - how to use them? Most of these signals absolutely need test instruments and the few tests that don't need instrumentation require far better explanations if they are to be done by eye.

Conclusion: I've come to believe that most but not all of the positive reviews of this disk involved people who never understood the tests they were performing and likely misinterpreted the results. For others who liked this disk maybe it was a revelation that the vivid settings, the default/out of the box settings present on many TVs, are not the best. In that case, I suppose the overly long and verbose explanation of how television evolved might be useful if it urges someone to play with the settings of their TV to get a better picture. In a similar vein - some of the tests might be helpful if the HDTV was grossly mis calibrated but even then, using this disk, the HDTV would only be marginally better.

You will do much better checking out CNET where they publish the settings they use for any TV reviewed or visit the AVS forum and look for a discussion on your make and model of TV.

Update: If you click on comments for this review you'll discover a link another Amazon member provided that directs you to a superb tutorial on calibration.

I just expected a step by step guide showing me what to adjust. Something along the lines of....""adjust your color until this picture disappears"".

If you can make it through the technical drivel and history of TV's, from CRT forward, and IF you can stay awake to get to the test patterns, it WILL improve your TV. Give this disk about an hour or more of your time to understand the history and background of TVs, and then you can use the 5-10 minutes of calibration test patterns to tweak your TV. I used this to tweak a cheap LCD that had bluish washed out black levels that I could never get right, and it now looks incredible. This disc has WAAAY more information and test patterns than other disks.

The problem is that it's 60 minutes of technical drivel (and I'm an electronics and AV tech), with literally a couple of seconds of instruction on how to set your TV for each section. Each section is about 10 minutes of technical background, then ONE SENTENCE on how to use adjust your TV using the test pattern. Fall asleep and you'll miss the actual instructions.

Here's how to use this disc. You'll need to invest some time. Grab some coffee, and just WATCH the disk, all of it. Take breaks if you need to. Rewind if you have to. Pause the disc and take notes (when they actually TELL you how to use a pattern). It took me over an hour to get through this painful process. Once you understand it, then just load the test patterns and take the 5-10 minutes to tune up your TV. Go see your neighbor. Fix his TV. You'll be a calibration Disc guru. Tweak all your friend's TVs. If you don't, you will want to kill someone (maybe yourself) for wasting all your time for watching this drivel.

2931497,2,B000V6LST0,"I still have the original Avia DVD, but it's totally geared toward the old CRT TV sets, so I rented DVE: HD Basics on Blu-ray from Netflix. Overall, I find this HDTV calibration program quite disappointing.

My main gripe is the calibration part -- the stuff you bought or rented the program for -- is very poorly explained. The narrator races through the poorly written script, leaving you scratching your head even after two or three passes. One thing that Avia, otherwise also a user-unfriendly calibration proram, gets it right is telling you clearly what you should expect to see.  HD Basics does tell you what you should see for a test, but that part is covered in like 2 seconds, and if you blinked, you would have missed it, while the narrator continues stuffing your head with lots of techno talk that adds no value to the program.

An additional problem is, only the basic tests are explained in the video, and so-called advanced tests are only briefly described in the test navigation menu, in a font so small that it's very difficult and eye-straining to read even on a big screen.

One thing that would have really helped is subtitles, or at least showing us the technical keywords the narrator is using, but there're none here. The introduction and HD in details sections are padded with useless materials, and sitting through them is an exercise in frustration -- but you have to watch most of them in order to truly understand, and properly use, the tests later!

Another problem is the menu navigation on this disc is counter-intuitive. When you press the up arrow, for instance, you'd expect to see the previous menu item highlighted; instead, it's reversed: the list scrolls up. I feel like I'm playing with one of those flight simulators from the 80s that got the pitch control wrong.

Anyway, one piece of advice I'd like to offer, regardless of what calibration program you use, is: after you calibrate, you should feel free to make slight adjustments so the picture looks right *to you*. In other words, use the calibrated settings as a starting point for finetuning. For example, using both Avia and HD Essentials gives me contrast that's a bit too low for my taste; also, the color is still a bit too saturated for me, too. So I change those settings a little bit, using what I consider ideal scenes from two high-quality Blu-ray discs: Kung Fu Panda (animation) and Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow (real-person film). The last thing you want is having a gorgeous HDTV display, calibrating it carefully, only to be wondering why you don't quite think the picture quality is right. This advice goes against what the calibration program creators tell you, but it comes from my experience of helping many people set up their TV displays, and I hope you'll agree that it's what's right to you that ultimately matters. (For the same reason, many audiophiles like to play with EQ settings, even though the ""flat"" setting is in theory the ideal setting because it brings out what the sound engineers had intended in the mastering studios.)",1230163200,5,3061,4.75517890772128

2931502,3,B000V6LST0,"Some quick info that I'm basing my review on: The TV I have is the Samsung LN52A750 (a very popular higher end TV right now). My HD sources are: Blu-Ray = PS3, Comcast HD cable, and an XBOX 360 for games. All of these are via HDMI.

I almost always have my TV on in a dark room which is what I wanted the calibration optimized for. I tried my naked eye, then the THX test pattern on the Terminator 2 Blu-Ray but I noticed some noise/graininess in background images sometimes.

Pros

1. Makes the THX test pattern that is available with some Blu-Rays a waste of time. I used the one that came with Terminator 2 (but they're all the same). I did not like the results. But I tried it because renting T2 on Blu-Ray was faster and cheaper than buying DVE so I thought I'd give it a try. To me, the THX patterns are next to worthless. I hate to be so critical but they really are.

2. In-depth education about HD in general, some tricks and methods used by TV manufacturers as well as movie studios, mastering firms, etc. This information is interesting, educational, and useful for optimizing your set. Even though a setting like ""color"" in your menu might seem obvious, this disc explains how it works within your set which does help in the calibration process.

3. Comes with a color filter that you hold up to your eye to get the red/green/blue correct.

4. If you set aside a couple of hours (yes, a couple of hours) and pay attention to the information presented on this disc (may take watching the same section a few times) you will get your set calibrated as close as you can. Skipping right to the test patterns won't do you any good because you won't know what you're trying to achieve. Spending hundreds of dollars to have someone come out is just crazy.

5. After adjusting some settings, my TV really does look even better than my own naked eye settings (which I was already in love with).

Cons

1. As I expected, there is nothing in this BD about my TV's unique settings for:
a. Backlight
b. HDMI Black Adjust
c. Dynamic Contrast
d. DNR (digital noise reduction)
e. And other menu options (flesh tone, white space, etc.) included in my LN52A750. But I think the factory options for these are fine.

2. While it does include a wealth of info, it's sometimes narrated too fast and/or not clearly enough. I had to watch the section that explains the test patterns 3 times. I didn't mind doing it but thought they could have delivered this in a better way.

Parts of this disc may seem intimidating (even for those of you that consider yourself experts because you browse A/V forums LOL) but if you watch the sections a few times until you understand, you'll be happy you did. My picture really is improved, and I got rid of the background graininess and noise. I think this disc is worth hanging onto, mainly because of future environmental changes that may occur (i.e. you move, rearrange your room, change the lighting, etc.).

I struggled with 3 or 4 stars. I'm happy with the purchase but would have given it 4 or 5 stars if it included info on other menu items in my TV.",1227830400,93,3081,4.414462081128748

This disc features a horrible menu system that is confusing to navigate and understand.  It took me awhile to figure out where to go to calibrate my set without hearing the lecture about the evolution of HD.  The narrator will talk FOREVER about what adjustments you'll eventually have to make but you'll never know when exactly to make those adjustments.

2931530,4,B000V6LST0,"Ok, you now own a state of the art HD display or projector. Setting-up the picture quality with Blu-ray HD DVE HD basics is a good start. Out of the box we all know that most default settings need tweaking (especially with all viewing environments never the same - which is what NTSC stands for - never the same color). This disc gets the basic HD blu-ray playback calibrations set (brightness, contrast, color and tint). I found navigating through the different menus intuitive. If you know what you are doing, you can just jump directly to the test charts - very handy for a quick tweak.  It also has comprehensive tutorials that cover the technical perimeters of HD displays and proper set-up, if you need to know.

Setting proper grayscale, gamma and individual colors (right color space) is another matter. Unless you have the right tools and understand ISF standards - setting those very crucial elements is difficult with this Disc - hence the title BASIC.

Nothing replaces a pro-calibration. The good news is that it improves on what is out of the box, and can get the picture quality to a very pleasing level - leaving the gamma, grayscale, and advance color on a best mode - because you can set the basics fairly easily with all the right test patterns and primary color filters (RGB)  - that are included.

1. User interface. To utilize BD Video features to design the UI so that a professional can easily select test patterns

2931537,3,B000V6LST0,"I have a PS3, a 720p LCD TV, and a 720p DLP Projector. I have the AVIA and GetGrey calibration discs. I was excited about this product because I wanted to have HD versions of the test patterns in order to calibrate in pure HD as opposed to upscaled SD, in case different software and different video paths are used in the PS3 for HD versus SD. But I also wanted this disc because reviews and descriptions made it seem like there was expert help that walked you through (via the narrative) the proper use of the various tests.

I have to say that I was disappointed in the narrative. It gives a nice history of video technology and does explain a lot things in detail but it doesn't provide the kind of help that I was looking for. I also didn't like that thy used professional ""voice talent"" to read the narrative. It was painfully obvious that the speaker had no idea what he was saying and was just reading off a script. I would have much preferred to listen to a real audio/video expert.

I was also very disappointed in the lack of any color ramps on the disc. How am I supposed to accurately check color clipping without color ramps?

There was also a glitch in the navigation. It may be because I have the PS3 set to output 720p (to match my TV and Projector), but at times when I would bring up the nav menu it would be way too big and cut off at the bottom of the screen so you could only see the top half of it.

Still, there are many good things about this disc. It has some good HD reference videos, the section about audio and speaker setup is very thorough, and the historical explanation of why our video system is the way it is was very interesting. It does explain a lot of things well. And it includes some great color filters that are inside a cardboard frame. These filters are a lot easier to handle and store than the three loose ones that come with AVIA.

But as far as calibration goes; I went through all the tests and came up with the exact settings that I got from using AVIA and GetGrey.

I suppose I could sum it up by saying that if i had been able to borrow this disc from a friend before buying it, I would have thoroughly enjoyed going through it one time but I would have just stuck with the calibration discs that I already have.",1209340800,4,2263,4.202764976958525
2931538,1,B000V6LST0,"Waste of time, money and effort. Even the Basic set up section leaves much to be desired.

I have a new Samsung 50 Plasma that is filled with more then one set of contrast sliders, white balance sliders, color sliders and other settings like edge enhancement and DNie. Sure, this disk in not for a certain manufacture, but it is very limited in even explaining the basic contrast, color and brightness. At times your are not even sure what you are supposed to be changing. Even the little color look through viewer they give you to adjust your color is only marginal in helping because you cant really get all the color boxes to be the same shade. In the case of my TV, say I'm trying to set brightness and contrast using this DVD, how could I possibly know how the other settings for HDMI black or dynamic contrast will affect the main sliders for brightness and contrast. This disk spends way too much time explaining the history of HD and where it came from in regards to CRT technology, instead of just getting to the idea behind why we bought this disk in the first place, to make our new high tech TV look better. The plain truth is, my new Samsung already looks good, and pretty much did not need further adjustments that this DVD suggested, and I got my picture to look good just with tweaks I made to suit my viewing tastes.

2931540,4,B000V6LST0,"Well, this is the 5th review of this product and the first one by someone who has actually used it...go figure.

This product is very similar to design and function of the original Digital Video Essentials (DVE) for standard DVD: it has in-depth explanations of current display technologies and how they differ from each other as well as (the most important thing) video and audio test patterns to setup and calibrate your video and audio system (as well as instructions on how to do so).

The HD test patterns are encoded as VC-1 (video) at 1080p and 720p, and Dolby TrueHD (audio).  The basic video test patterns are essentially the same as what can be found on the DVE disc but the advanced patterns are different and include a one-pixel-on-one-pixel-off test for 1080p displays, as well as various shades of gray boxes with PLUGE patterns. (It may be of interest to some that the Toshiba HD-A35 HD-DVD player that I have does not pass below-black information.  It does not, however, seem to clip the above-white signals). Through testing, I came to the (somewhat surprising) conclusion that my HD-DVD player and Panasonic standard DVD player require essentially the same settings on the display when using the HDMI cable.

The audio test signals (and my subsequent A/V receiver settings) were very different, however, from standard Dollby Digital 5.1. Because my receiver does not have any HDMI inputs, in order to enjoy 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, I have to utilize the HD-A35's internal decoders and analog audio outputs.  Standard DVD's have sounded very different with this setup so I was looking forward to the audio test signals on this disc (particularly subwoofer level adjustments).  However, the audio test signals are much more limited in quantity than the DVE disc.  It's by no means spartan (and it even has a few additional tests over DVE) but the number of tests is small. There is a dedicated LFE signal to set subwoofer level, but the Full-Bandwidth test for all speakers is mistakenly recorded as Limited Bandwidth (which already appears on the disc) so there is no simple way to match subwoofer level to main speaker levels.  There are separate Full-Bandwidth signals for the 2 front speakers (and they indicate that they were recorded at the same level as the LFE signal) so this is what I used. I was hoping there would also be DD+ test signals, but there was only the (superior) Dolby True-HD. Ultimately, I was not left high and dry by the audio test signals, but there could have been more of them to finetune the settings.

Navigation of the disc is fairly simple but because HD-DVD works differently than DVD, you may find yourself over-shooting the test you actually want.

All in all, I think you can probably use your original DVE disc for most video setttings and the audio settings can be done fairly accurately with your HD-DVD player's test tone (if it has this feature).  There are additional tests that make the disc worth getting (or if you don't already own DVE, this is a must-have) but it's (few) shortcomings drop it to an overall 4 star rating.

For first time calibration disc users:  5 stars
For owners of the original DVE for DVD:  3 stars",1207094400,41,3177,4.793040293040293

The disk talks about how to setup your CRT during the entire disk. CRT who is buying a tube TV today?  At first we thought it was a joke.
