Now Chagum must learn to bland in, but his speech and intelligence are obviously not that of a commoner. It will take some practice to keep from standing out. Balsa also has a problem. Her spear is broken. She visits a master blacksmith for a new one. But while they are there, the Emperor's elite soldiers are also there to get weapons. Balsa and Chagum must hide in the other room and pray they don't get discovered. Toya also takes Chagum out on the town and teaches him some street smarts.

This volume didn't have any action, but it was great. The story takes an interesting turn. I had thought that the duo would be on the run the whole series. That looks like it isn't going to be the case. I like that some of the other great characters are getting some screen time. This anime has plenty of good characters worth developing. Tanda, Toya, Saya, and Shuga are all given some more screen time, and that makes me happy. Moribito is shaping up to be a great series. I think that this is one of those shows that just about anyone can appreciate. I strongly recommend it.",1357776000,,1190,4.336322869955157

Kenji Kamiyama, who also directed Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C 2nd GIG, offers a work that is beautiful to watch -- great nature scenes (colors, birds, insects). At times the language can be a little stiff like Ghost in the Shell -- but it is this same thoughtful quality that makes successive viewings worthwhile.",1243814400,,432,4.623376623376624
8316944,5,B001L28GZM,"I can only say this - if you're a lover of beautiful animation, myth and folklore, perfectly rendered emotional drama and thrilling action, this series is for you.  It's spectacular on every level.  Barsa and Chagum are two of the most indelible characters in any medium, and their story is told on a backdrop of ancient myths and songs and breathtaking scenery.  Based on a wonderful series of Japanese novels, Production I.G. and Kenji Kamiyama have surpassed their usual excellence here - this is the apex of their great bodies of work.  This is truly a masterpiece in any medium - it plays out like a novel on screen, with each development fitting seamlessly into the next so naturally it's as if no other course was possible.  Seirei no Moribito will make you realize just what heights of brilliance anime can achieve.",1241568000,3,823,4.767605633802817
