2616518,1,B000GRTR4W,"I did not care for it.  The man does deep knee-bends?  That is terrible on the knees, add the weights and you have just compounded the problem.  He also had no warm-up or cool-down at all.

All in all not a good circuit workout.  I would suggest Cathe Friedrich or Jari Love.

2616519,5,B000GRTR4W,"This is a wonderful workout for those looking to get in shape fast. John takes you through on a step by step workout and eliminates the need for guesswork. I saw results within the first week. I feel stronger and much more confident. My wife also uses this workout and the transformation has been incredible. She told me that I have literally turned back the hands of time. My chest is full and my arms are huge. I can actually feel the blood pumpimg through my veins when I'm working out. I can see my wife's abs and she has had to buy new clothes because her old ones just don't fit. Buy this video and you won't be disappointed. Just remember to eat, and eat well.",1159660800,16,667,4.25984251968504
8134100,5,B000GRTR4W,You think this work out is easy and the next day you can't walk. Be sure to stretch.,1512086400,,84,3.7222222222222223
8134101,5,B000GRTR4W,"This video is awesome! John has a very kind and encouraging tone, and his dialogue is informative. He is not offensive in any way. ****WARNING**** DO NOT PUSH IT!!! This workout will tear you up! Take it easy, and gradually increase the weight. The first time i did this I hurt worse than I ever have after any workout ever! I could not bend my legs, my knees would buckle from my muscles just giving out on me. I had to fall onto the toilet just to relieve myself. It took me about 5 days to feel normal again. I was obviously in horrible shape physically, worse than i had thought.

I have to improvise some because i don't have a bench yet, but still the exercises are very well displayed and explained.",1378252800,,706,4.30827067669173
8134102,4,B000GRTR4W,"Great for beginners, but a little too entry level for me.  John can be a bit corny at times too but over all, it is good if your just starting out.",1314921600,,147,3.7419354838709675
8134103,5,B000GRTR4W,"John Basedow is awesome! I can't tell you how much of an awesome purchase this was. The service was awesome as well. I love Amazon.com ..!!!!! You always have the best service, the best sellers and the best Products. God Bless you John Basedow...
Keep rockin,  :)

8134104,2,B000GRTR4W,"This would be good for beginners, but a little too basic for me.  He's a little bit too cheesy for me.",1232755200,,102,3.857142857142857
8134105,5,B000GRTR4W,"Personally, I think this is a great workout DVD. It will really make you sweat, get your heart pumping and you WILL feel results. Point of fact - I've been doing this DVD for just under a month now and it's already showing results. I also have the Better Body Basics DVD which I found works great in conjunction with this. Highly recommended, but you need to stick with it!

One caveat - as mentioned earlier, there are no warm-ups or cool-down exercises on this DVD. It's jumps right into it. You really should do your own warm-ups before attempting this DVD. I'm not quite sure why there isn't one on it. Ironically, the BBB DVD *does* have warm-ups and cool-downs, so you could do those before starting the Fat Burning DVD.",1217721600,4,726,4.5
8134106,4,B000GRTR4W,"John B. is correct; being consistent is key to anything, especially in getting results. You work right along with him and he suggests pausing when needed; once you've gotten thru the 3rd workout, you will feel more comfortable with adding more weight. I also love his meal instruction section.  The time goes by reality quick; you feel as if you have your own personal trainer and you don't even need to leave home! If you feel the need to warm up, just do it--I just do a few stretches and then start right in.  Good luck all.

 Hey all, this is just an update.  After doing this for a month, about 3-4 times weekly, I visited my friend in Maryland and happened to see myself in her large mirror.....I noticed a body I finally liked.  My thighs were toned, tighter, more shapely too.  It was almost as if things had gone back to where they use to be (smiles).  It just gets better.",1214352000,2,900,4.451219512195122

Reshape your body in record time with Fitness Made Simple's 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT. Workout at home with Fitness Celebrity John Basedow doing specifically targeted exercises to sculpt your chest, back, shoulders arms, legs, and abs. Taped on location in a picturesque botanical garden, the 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT overcomes limitations of purely aerobic videos by actually helping men and women change their body composition...shifting it more in favor of lean mass or muscle while decreasing body fat percentage.

""Aerobics are great for losing weight to a degree but if you have a ""pear-shaped"" body, for instance, the best purely aerobic training may do is turn you into a smaller ""pear."" Someone with a big ""spare tire"" may decrease the size of the ""spare"" but that's it. The 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT takes us to the next level. The goal of this workout is to stimulate muscle growth and maximize fat burning so we get a leaner, more toned physique.

""There are no tricky dance moves, no high impact gyrations; instead, this video combines light weight training exercises at a heart pumping cardio pace to shape us up by increasing muscle and burning pounds of fat.""

- John Basedow

The FMS 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT is a double threat to your fat reserves...

You burn some fat just by regularly doing the exercises.

The lean muscle you build helps increase metabolism. Muscle tissue is metabolically active and burns fat just to exist...even when you're at rest. By regularly following the FMS 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT you're priming your bodies to better burn fat 24 hours a day...every day...365 days a year...even while you're sleeping!

On this video you workout together with John...starting out with the major muscle groups...chest, back, and legs...then go on to the smaller ones...shoulders and arms...and finally end with a definition-increasing ab workout so guys can get that tight six pack they're usually after and ladies can get a lean, toned midsection. You'll do some ""superset"" exercises which combine back-to-back sets of 2 or more exercises without rest periods between them to stimulate muscle growth and also keep your heart rate up so you get a good cardio workout as well to maximize fat burning.

As with many of our home-style videos convenience is key to making exercise a part of our lives...so the FMS 45Min FAT BURNING WORKOUT requires very little equipment...only a couple of free weights (dumbbells) and a bench. All of the exercises can be done right at home so you don't have to get dressed-up, drive to the gym, worry about who you're going to run into, or do anything other than focus on the great results you're going to get from this program.",1163548800,,2826,4.995744680851064
