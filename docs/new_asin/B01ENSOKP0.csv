8759269,1,B01ENSOKP0,I may stop watching British dvd's after this. The story looked promising but quickly went down hill. The banker had as much expression as a rock. The relationship between and the daughter was just weird. I'd like my money back.,1494115200,,227,4.7

8759271,4,B01ENSOKP0,"Good Irish drama based in Wexford. Irish manage to create subdued environment and moody atmospheres very easily. Don't think it was all that well reviewed on IMDb, but I liked it.",1486080000,,179,4.806451612903226

8759274,5,B01ENSOKP0,"Clean Break, Season 1, Aidan McArdle. In this twisty complex thriller set in a small Irish town in the vicinity of Westport, car dealer Frank Mallon (Adam Fergus) is having a tough time. His wife has left him; his cars arent; his teenage daughter Corrina (Kelly Thornton), in her mothers absence, more or less has. Bank manager Desmond Rane (Aidan McArdle, MR. SELFRIDGE) then tells Frank hes calling in Franks overdraft, loans, mortgages, the lot.  So Frank devises a plan that he hopes will fix his money problems while also getting him revenge.

But one of his conspirators (Damien Molony, SUSPECTS, BEING HUMAN, RIPPER STREET), also his employee and his daughters lover, disappears.  This riveting television serial was written by the award-winning Billy Roche, made by RTE, Irish television. It does have a real Irish feel in its landscapes, atmosphere, brogues, clothes, interiors, cars. And craic.  The acting in this character-driven experience is fine, the plot quick-moving, multi-layered, gripping.  The box set, which I received in expectation of an honest unbiased review, consists of four episodes on two discs, running approximately 214 minutes.  It has subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not accustomed to Irish dialect.  It does also contain coarse language, violence, disturbing images, sexual situations, so beware, sensitive souls or those responsible for family viewing. I do have one teensy complaint about this crime drama, however. Sean McGinley, (BRAVEHEART, REPUBLIC OF DOYLE, BUTCHER BOY, THE GENERAL, BLEAK HOUSE), whos the only actor in it with whose work Im familiar, is given only co-star billing. And whatever is that about? Nevertheless, be advised: this production is compelling, binge-worthy viewing: it kept us glued to the screen.",1471392000,10,1775,5.363309352517986
8759275,5,B01ENSOKP0,"A riveting 4 episodes in one continuing crime story. Is it character-driven mystery, scenic suspense, haunting thrilleryes, yes, & yes. A do not miss DVD only for teens and older. And no promises that viewing adults will not have a nightmare or two from the experience. It is a story about a botched kidnapping that grows worse with time under investigation. Dont expect the expected. Do expect some great acting from several seasoned cast members. It is as deviously wicked as it is Irish-countryside charming. Every character has compelling complex living faults. Love, revenge, greed, angerwhats not to like, and loathe in the same instant.
Writing talent and acting push this set among the top ratings.

Meet some of the cast: Banker Rane (Aidan McArdle Mr Selfridge) with wife (Simone Kirby Peaky Blinders) and daughter (Amybeth McNulty new face with promise). Down-on-his-luck car dealership owner Mallon (Adam Fergus) with his boxer/salesman Danny (Damien Molony Ripper Street) plus a boxing club gym manager (Sean McGinley Republic of Doyle Bleak House). Two others among the crime gang are Noel (Ned Dennehy) and Teeth (Packy Lee); both Dennehy and Lee having come from a powerful series Peaky Blinders which is not to be missed as well. Clean Break is not quite as bloody as Peaky, but there are similarities. If you like one, then like the other.

 SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes.
&nbsp;Filmed in Ireland, ah, lovely. Frank, estranged from wife, teen daughter going rogue, and in financial trouble around Wexford, Eire. Despairing days lead to desperate plans. An abducted child complicates the illegal plan.
