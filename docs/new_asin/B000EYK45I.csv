8115791,1,B000EYK45I,"About forty minutes into this film, viewers at this house were sobbing with laughter. This may very well be the worst musical film ever made. It certainly tortures the folk revival movement to within an inch of its life. But each scene is more ludicrous than the one before, and the cumulative effect is hilarious. In the 'so bad it's good' category, this film should become a cult phenomenon. Audiences could get up and dance to the dream sequence - extra points for dressing like whatever animal that guy's supposed to be - and chomp down on pizza during the food fight...",1517356800,,574,4.637254901960785

you cannot beat Hootenanny a Go-Go!
not to mention a young Joan Rivers in her first
incarnation as one-third of a folk-humor trio.",1362441600,,184,5.379310344827586
8115797,2,B000EYK45I,"Seems that the Producer and Writer loved traditional folk music and the movie ""Blue Hawaii"". Interesting blend (no pun). Something about a rich, older kid from Boston who half-heartedly buys a barely subsisting Coffee House in Miami, then falls for the new up and comer, played by Karen Thorsell. Along the way, he has to deal with an Expresso machine with artificial intelligence, and a former owner who tries to ""hip"" him to the new scene. Some real humour would have been nice but it's one of those deals where the viewer wonders if the creative powers were trying intentionally to make the gags as lame as possible.
Not at the level technically as the TV Series, but the musical performances give the film credibility. In the Features section, the Producers state the music was performed over Playback but to this Reviewer it appears that some actual live performance was accomplished on the sound stage, very unsual in a teen musical (Or any musical).
Another interesting aspect, is that there appears to be a good amount of on-stage ad-libbing going, a great touch.
The Folk Music of artists like Oscar Brand is presented along with some bubble-gum ballads, so at times the ""Beach Movie"" imagery factors in to leave the viewer a tad confused.
Sound and picture quality substandard, though a Folk fan shouldn't be too upset.
Joan Rivers and Gloria Loring, among others, making their film debut. Fans of Deanna Lund may be disappointed - she's basically incognito in this film - a strange choice.
This low-budget affair is rooted to the period and should susatin as a Cult favorite. The running commentary by the Producers adds alot of flavor.",1228780800,3,1647,4.864768683274021
8115798,5,B000EYK45I,"Yeah!  The movie known as ONCE UPON A COFFEE HOUSE is now available on DVD (under a DVD title that is obviously designed to help sell it better).  It's one of those rare films that was very difficult to buy but is now available commercially.  Joan Rivers is great and if you like old country songs or beach party movies, this is one you want to add to your bookshelf.  The producer commentary is a great bonus.  It's like a time capsule that hasn't been opened in years.",1179878400,3,470,4.295454545454546
8115799,3,B000EYK45I,"By most measures, this is an idiotic low-budget movie from 1965 that transplants the beach blanket movie ethos into a coffee house.  What little plot there is is foolish, the writing is poor, the ""screwball"" humor is not humorous.  It almost insults the viewer.

However, it is filled with performances by folk acts, and that made this somewhat worth watching for me.  Some of the performers are very commercial, but you also get Oscar Brand, a fascinating glimpse of a very young Joan Rivers doing a comedy routine and, best of all, a couple numbers by the great and now mostly forgotten Vince Martin, whose name deserves to be on the front of the box (look him up if you don't know who he is).

So, as a film its junk.  As a folk variety show, its uneven but worth checking out to see some rare, vintage performances if you are into that kind of music.  Bonus features include commentary from the producer.",1179360000,8,908,4.533742331288344
8115800,5,B000EYK45I,"This is a great folksinging early 60's movie when the music was really at it's peak about a wealthy New Yorker who buys a CoffeeHouse in Miami and falls for the singer there trying to fit in with her beatnik friends. Mostly done for the music featuring The Goldebriars,The Free Wheelers,Oscar Brand and Joan Rivers when she was part of the comedy singing trio of Jim Jake and Joan just before she became famous going solo. It's an interesting curio!!!",1150848000,3,451,4.65
