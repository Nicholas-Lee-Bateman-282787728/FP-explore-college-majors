302424,4,6300984869,"This poignant 1987 film was the culmination of an era. It was the last film of Lillian Gish, Ann Sothern, and director Lindsay Anderson. It was the last great performance of Bette Davis and Vincent Price, who previously worked together nearly 50 years earlier.

The film is totally real. It is set in the early 1950s, on a small Maine island where two elderly sisters have gone to vacation the summer away as they have since they were girls.  There is s brief prologue in sepia where Mary Steenburgen plays Gish, Margaret Ladd (Falcon Crest) plays Davis, and Tisha Sterling plays her real life mother Ann Sothern who plays Tisha, a friend to the two old sisters.

Vincent Price plays a a former Russian aristocrat who has his eye on Lillian. Davis is blind and relys on her sister who she feels Price is trying to take away from her.  There are great performances in this film superbly written by David Berry.  It's all senior citizens. You won't find anyone younger than 70 in this film. It's about their life and how they live it at such an advanced age. Gish was 93 when she made this and had been acting since she was a child in the gay 1890s.

Great special features! The widescreen blu ray for the 30th anniversary looks amazing. There is an audio commentary with the producer as well as on location interviews with Gish, Davis, Price, Sothern, Harry Carey Jr., and the director.

There are also current interviews from Steenburgen, Ladd, and Sterling as well as snippets from the makers. Also a nine minute segment from a Malcolm McDowell video where he recalls his old friends from this film.

Finally, Tisha Sterling sings a song that celebrates the film.

It's simply brilliant. Sothern was nominated for am Oscar. The others should have been as well.",1515110400,2,1761,4.65483870967742

302428,3,6300984869,"The Whales of August is set on a Maine island where two sisters have spent summers for more than half a century. Now they are both widows. The story takes place over the course of a single day. Bette Davis plays the blind and frail Libby Strong, and Lillian Gish plays her sister Sarah Webber. Libby makes many demands of her sister and is resigned to wait until death takers her. But Sarah is the opposite. She still takes an interest in life, people and her roses. She embraces new experiences rather than shying away from them, and loves gossiping with neighbor Tisha Doughty (Ann Sothern), who brings the sisters blueberries.

Libby and Sarah argue about putting in a large picture window, but the argument hinges on Libbys desire to live in the past while Sarah still looks to the future. The sisters are visited by Mr. Maranov (Vincent Price), a member of Russian nobility who suggests that he move in with the ladies.

Bette Davis had undergone a series of debilitating setbacks as evidenced by her thinness and slow movement, yet she delivers as the cranky sister whose wealth has a hold on her sister. Ms. Gish was 94 when she made the film, and she had been acting in movies with director D.W. Griffith since practically the birth of the film medium.

The films stage origins are apparent by the limited location, and director Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man) does little in the way of opening up the action, which gives the film a claustrophobic feel.

The film marked the last screen appearances of Gish and Sothern, and was among the last performances by Davis and Price. The four leads represent long-gone days of Hollywood, providing a bittersweet touch to the simple tale.

Special materials on the widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentary; 1986 interviews with Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Vincent Price and Ann Southern, and director Lindsay Anderson; Malcolm McDowell discussing director Lindsay Anderson; several vignettes by producer Mike Kaplan; and a theatrical trailer.",1513728000,,2000,4.922848664688427

The other (Bette Davis) is fighting the inevitable, and takes no pleasure in their everyday routine. Though the end is coming, they ponder about life, and how they both have outlived their mother. Then comes death himself, as only the great Vincent Prize could have played it. Notice the scene where he is fishing....his fish is already dead. Only Sarah is gracious enough to entertain him, whereas Libby knows and does not welcome him.
Alas, the whales of their youth won't be coming back.....and they both make peace with growing old and Libby finally accepts the inevitable and welcomes it (as seen by her acceptance of the new window, which she though was a waste at their age).",1499126400,,819,4.774647887323944

The first forty-five minutes were slow and none-too-convincing, I thought. But the last 45 really did turn things around and I'm glad I stayed with it. I do think that in some scenes the actors, Gish and Davis, didn't really seem to be too focused. You might think this would add to the film, the whole aging theme, but when it looks like you're having trouble remembering your lines, it really doesn't. But I liked the ending. Gish realized she would die in that house, wasn't going anywhere, and neither was her sister and both were okay with that. In that house -- how could you not? Winterized, or not.

Perhaps I missed a point of the story but it was almost embarrassing to watch...as though I was observing an awkward part of some peoples' lives that I really should not see.

302663,5,6300984869,"The teaming of four cinematic legends at the end of their respective careers is a treasure not to be missed. Bette Davis, by this time wracked with age and illness, still answers the bell with a tour de force performance that so illustrates the struggle of accepting the inevitable ""final curtain"". Lillian Gish, at 93, is just sensational as the put upon yet sympathetic sister who embraces the struggle with grace and dignity. Ann Southern gives great veteran support and hits the right tone to keep the movie's mood reflective yet uplifting. The great Vincent Price turns in a superb performance as the road weary Russian looking to find value and importance to his life. I have often wondered why his role never brought him his long overdue Oscar nomination, it was truly remarkable. The DVD transfer is impressive and brings out the beautiful scenery of the film stunningly. Sadly, this is an often overlooked masterpiece by four legends, maybe because it is devoid of violence and a weird underlying message. I've watched it several times, and each time I still pack my handkerchief before viewing it. It is a powerful, sentimental, and ultimately triumphant look at the approaching end of life and the strength and bonds that make the inevitable acceptable.",1447718400,,1264,4.966981132075472

This is a very nice portrayal of a period in our history that ended with the world wars and has, for better or worse, already become difficult to remember or to understand. The attention to etiquette and the character of a Russian nobleman are characteristic of the times. My own grandfather, a farmer, never went to town in his work clothes. The characters in the film refuse to give up their life view even as it leaves them.
This film is exquisitely written and acted. I was a cherished reminder of this era. A very entertaining history lesson.

Their childhood friend and neighbor is played by Ann Sothern.  The three of them take a ""long day's journey into the night"" before all is settled.

It is one of the least spectacular, but most memorable, and probably best, movies I have seen.  I like it because it is about old people, played by old people, and somehow does not get old.  Seeing it every ten years is refreshing.

The filming is low-budget and none of the scenes are more than 100 yards from the cabin.  It relies totally on  a beautiful coastline, good acting and a good script.  Being reminded of the etiquette and decorum of fine people of the past is refreshing.  The film's colors, saturation and vibrancy resemble 35mm Kodachrome slides.

302833,5,6300984869,"I've always thought of this film as ""a quiet look at time passing."" Some movies overwhelm the senses, while some linger on like the scent of a soft perfume or nearby roses wafting on the breeze. Such is this film, The Whales of August.

When I first saw The Whales of August in the theater back in 1987, I thought it a bit wooden, as though the play had not transitioned gracefully to the big screen. However, when the home video was released, I bought a copy anyway, if only to serve as a souvenir from having seen the film with a dear friend.

Later I rediscovered a hidden gem and a timeless message with endearing characters and an ambience that I wanted to visit again and again. I just love being in that house, on that cove, in that element, at that time of year, visiting with Sarah, Libby, and company! The Whales of August is a sweet, melancholy experience that never grows old.

Oddly, just this year I came to see a deeper meaning of the title, which had always eluded me. But you need not ponder its meaning right now. Just relax and enjoy a visit with some lovely characters whom you just might find yourself, as I do, wanting to visit again every August.

This year I even hosted a ""Whales of August"" home viewing to discuss with friends the concept of ""whale watching"" in our lives. The salon discussion afterwards was a great hit!

Although the film has been unfairly panned by folks who dismiss it as a mere vehicle for its veteran actors, David Berry's quiet tale is splendid to me. Over the years I have come to appreciate the story in new ways, as ""whales"" (life events) come and go, and I find myself visiting gentle, optimistic Sarah and dear friend Tisha, and even the cantankerous Libby each August via DVD (Oh, that it were available on blu-ray!).

 ""The Whales of August"" has earned a place among my most cherished films. I heartily recommend it.",1409875200,4,1873,4.45906432748538

303014,5,6300984869,"This movie is a treasure chest of small silver coins being cast before the viewer's eyes by this tender and gracious film experience. Silver coins are discovered everywhere as the viewer follows the experiences of two very elderly sisters played by Bette Davis and Lillian Gish, who live in an old house scenically overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and wait each August for the return of the whales.

Silver coins are found in the form of marvelous acting, sensitivity for the scenic coastline, the play of the wind on the water, the beauty of flowers, rock and sea, and the remarkable acting skills exhibited by this team of seasoned actors. This movie is a tour-de-force of acting and understated drama. The sisters are joined by two local friends played by Vincent Price and Ann Southern as well as by a local handyman played by Harry Carey Jr. This by any account would be reckoned as a stellar cast and they live up to all expectations as their little dramas of life unfold. The movie shows a wonderful sensitivity to the beauties of that rocky coastline and dedicates precious moments to rejoicing in the quite, still beauty of the scene.

One of the touching scenes takes place in the evening when Mr. Maranov, played by Vincent Price, and Mrs. Webber, played by Lillian Gish are admiring the beauty of the moon over the water and Mr. Maranov comments on ""how the moon casts its silver coins along the shore; there is a treasure that can never be spent"" as they watch the reflection of the moon on the water below. This is a lovely and touching scene and captures the spirit of the entire movie; a spirit of tenderness and reflection on life.

I found this movie to be a very special experience and highly recommend it for those who can enjoy beauty and subtlety. It is one of those movies that will withstand repeated viewings and is definitely suitable for the entire family. In short, it is a treasure chest of silver coins that can never be spent.",1342137600,4,1955,4.628242074927954
303015,4,6300984869,"so says Lillian Gish to Bette Davis.  And, at this point, Davis is so exhausted and ravaged that she accepts the verdict.  This line, after her stroke, after her cancer, after her diabolical daughters' book, could not have been easy to hear.  Or act.

But, stoically, she does.  It's a stunning moment and everyone who knew anything knew what Gish was saying and what Davis must have been feeling.

Gish and Davis are sisters in a timeless cottage (I say ""timeless"" as we never really figure out when this movie is supposed to take place until a car shows up in the driveway; late 40's or so).  Davis is blind and cantankerous and Gish is all tea and honey.

I, for one, would LOVE to live in this house.  It's beautiful.  Old.  New.  Fancy.  Plain.  Just some house where two old ladies live.  A beautiful house (small) on the coast of Maine.  The scenery is gorgeous.  Like really gorgeous.

Not much happens in the film.  Which, depending on your take of things, is either good or awful.  Vincent Price plays some sort of homeless, devil-may-care Russian emigre and Ann Sothern, as a neighbor, are perfectly fine.  Though Sothern's attempt at a ""Maine/New England"" accent are too pronounced.  (She's the only one in the film who tries out an accent and has the audacity to stick with it).

The handyman also has an accent and he's loud and obnoxious but he's putting in the picture window which, for some reason, is pivotal to the plot.  I say ""for some reason"" as Davis, like I've said, is blind and what the hell would she care about a picture window?  (But her scene where she reaches for the blueberries is wonderful).

The cast is so chock full of old pros that there is no way that this can be a bad film.  You feel the frustration of both actresses as they play out their lives together.  Gish is understanding personified, if fretful and worried over her sister, and Davis is just as kind, if not misguided, in her sometimes harsh treatment of those around her.

You want to hug both of them.  And you will want to spend an afternoon with them.",1336435200,6,2055,4.490514905149052

The bleak seaside setting and the wait for the whales of August suspend time as do the flashbacks of sisters Bette (79) and Lilian (93) as girls at the same remote cottage. Vincent Price, Ann Sothern and Harry Carey Jr give good support in what seems a very sensitively and intelligently filmed play. Lilian and Bette are peerless.

They did not always agree but yet there was love between them. A very tender movie with all kinds of emotions.

The area it was filmed at was so beautiful, the home rustic a pleasent home.

I would love to be able to see the place and house where this movie was filmed. I am not sure where it was filmed, I feel it may of been in Maine.

I love the movie, it shows us that we should treat people in a kind and loving way especially our family.

303080,2,6300984869,"My favorite part of the movie was the scenery and the inside of the cottage. It was so quaint. I thought that Lillian Gish did an amazing acting performance. Bette Davis seemed too overly dramatic in her style. She just drew out her words in an odd way. There was one scene where she sat in a chair by the window and then looked out. A blind person would not look out the window. She came out of her room in a gorgeous dress that had small buttons all the way up the back, and I wondered how she could have ever buttoned them. (Maybe, I'm over-analytical) I loved Vincent Price. Wow, he is still appealing even in his later years! Great acting. I didn't care for Ann Sothern. Something about her seemed contrived...maybe it was the accent that just didn't seem natural to her.

The movie is basically the relationship between two elderly sisters who live in a house by the sea. That came across pretty realistically, but there was no real plot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Just people dropping in and drinking tea, people puttering around the yard, people going for short walks, ordinary things like that...not too exciting. The older sister started showing signs of senility, and I found that depressing. I also was angry at her for her manipulative behavior and her ingratitude for all that her sister was doing for her.

They mentioned the whales throughout the film and it almost seemed like one of the focal points, but then we never saw them and it seemed disappointing to me.  The ending was not a climax; it was uneventful. (which I won't disclose)",1242432000,4,1589,4.568421052631579

303082,4,6300984869,"The Whales of August is a very character driven film with a lot of very good dialogue and not a lot of action. It is one of those films were to ""get it"" you have to really listen to the actors and their body language. Lillian Gish is perfect as Sarah an elderly lady who isn't ready to give up on life and still has things to look forward to and that she wants- like a picture window to look out at the moonlight. Bette Davis is amazing as Libby Sarah's blind sister who is very bitter and just wants to get life over with. But at times she is also very shrewd and poignant- a complex woman. Ann Sothern and Vincent Price are good supporting parts as a busybody neighbor and an elderly would be suitor. Harry Carey Jr is great as a handyman who comes over and always makes a lot of noise. I think you have to be an adult to enjoy this movie and get what it is about- living life and not giving up that just because you are elderly doesn't mean your time is gone- that it is gone only when you die. The film belongs to Bette Davis. It is all the more poignant because she was most likely dying of cancer while making this movie and to see her do such excellent acting a year before she died shows what we have lost. The scene that to me stands out is when Ms. Davis says, "" We have such little time left."" It doesn't get more poignant then that. You see in Ms. Davis a woman who has really lived.

303084,4,6300984869,"During the last ten years or so of her career, the great Bette Davis was pretty much reduced to glorified cameo appearances: a production would hire her to play the family matron, a great aunt, or a similar role that would- by virtue of Ms. Davis' participation- add a certain pedigree to the film in question but in reality not give the actress very much to do (examples include ""The Watcher in the Woods"" and the TV film ""Murder With Mirrors"").  So, even though ""The Whales of August"" isn't a truly great film, it's certainly a good one, and it's certainly great to see Bette Davis go to work and carry a movie, just like in the old days.

To be sure, there are other notable performances in ""The Whales of August"": we get to see Vincent Price during one of the rare times we was asked to perform in an understated fashion, and he does a nice job; and we're treated to a rare late-career performance by the great Lillian Gish, whose career stretched back to the films of D.W. Griffith, and she does just as much work here as Ms. Davis, and it's very good work, too.  But for me the true enjoyment of this film came from seeing Bette Davis do again what Bette Davis always used to do: create an indelible, complex character and generally command every scene in which she appears.

In short: good movie, great performance.  This is a must-purchase or at least a must-see DVD for fans of America's great actors and actresses, and especially for fans of an actress near or at the top of that list, the wonderful Bette Davis.",1201478400,2,1522,4.440860215053763
303085,5,6300984869,"This film features four great actors who all were stars in the past but at the end of their careers and lives.

Lilian Gish (1893-1993) was a pioneer of silent films (80 films in 20 years!) but virtually disappeared with the advent of sound.  She was selective of her films during the next 40 years (only 14).  But when she was in her late 80's there was a resergence in her career with choice featured roles but at 95 she tackled her last role (and a starring role) in The Whales of August.  She was Sarah Webber, one of two fierce sisters hanging on to her dignity and spending her final years in a summer cottage on the coast of Maine with her blind sister.

Bette Davis (1908-1989) is considered on of the greatest movie stars of all time.  Bette was a true product of the old Hollywood system.  She worked her way from featured roles and the female interest roles to strong proud leading roles and became Warner Brothers biggest female star.  She, like Kate Hepburn, would be told that her career was over but she would find the role to relaunch it (All About Eve and Baby Jane.)  Not even a stroke kept her down.  The Whales of August was one of her post stroke films.  Some people might say that she looked terrible in the film but considering her stroke, she looked fantastic.  In the film she plays the Sarah's blind sister, Libby Strong.  Libby is estranged from her daughter and is dependant on her oldre sister - to the point she tries to drive away anyone who might come between them. (This was Bette's final completed film as she passed away while filming The Wicked Stepmother.)

Vincent Price (1911-1993) was the quintessential featured actor.  He never made leading man status until he starred in a series of horror films in the late 50's to early 70's and was the orginal host of PBS' Mystery anthology series during the 1980's.  And of course was the Voice of the Rap on the Michael Jackson video Thriller.  Vincent would only make 4 films after this film (only Edward Scissorhands was noteable.)  In The Whales of August, Price played Mr. Maranov a Russian emigre that has befriended the sisters.  In a deeper look, Mr. Maranov represents death - as warm inviting friend rather than a figure of doom.

Ann Southern (1909-2001) usually played supporting characters in large films and lead roles in second feature films.  She starred in a series of Maisey films from 1939 to 1947.  But she became one of televisions first big stars with her self titled show.  In The Whales of August, Ann played Trisha Dougherty, the sister's best friend (or at least best living friend.)  Ann received her only Oscar Nomination for this film (her final film). (By the way in the opening scene, young Trisha is played by Ann Southern's real daughter.)

The film is based on a play by David Berry but was beautifully opened up by the great British director Lindsay Anderson (This Sporting Life).  This also would be one of his last films.

This was a film that should have received better Oscar consideration as all four stars should have received nominations.  Four great artists in one great film.",1199836800,2,3100,4.607664233576642

303132,5,6300984869,"Forget the Amazon editorial review of this movie.  ""Fatally soppy"" indeed.  There's nothing maudlin here at all.  This is a perfectly observed movie by several giants of the movie screen: Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, and Vincent Price at their finest, with outstanding back-up by Ann Sothern and Harry Carey, Jr.  It is a moving, melancholy, sometimes almost elegiac look at two elderly sisters in their picturesque Maine cottage, dealing with memories and mortality.  The movie takes place over the space of one day, in the 1950s.

Bette Davis is Libby, the caustic blind sister who seems to thrive on bitterness and offending others.  But she is also quite astute and, in the end, is the one holding out hope to see the whales of August, to see that change can be good even near the end of a long life.

Gish is the kind, long-suffering sister who owns the cottage, and is a widow like her sibling.  She dearly misses her husband, dead for many decades, and wonders what to do with her irritable sister.

The sisters are visited by Tisha (Ann Sothern), the island gossiper and spark plug who is also beginning to really feel her age (she has just had her driver's license suspended).  Also visiting is the courtly Maranov (Vincent Price), a refugee from imperial Russia who has lived off his mother's jewels and with friends all his life.  A sport fisherman, he brings his catch to a dinner with the sisters, with Libby rebuffing him out loud for angling for more than just a meal.

There are frequent, peaceful scenery shots of the house and property, and of the sere yet beautiful cove and shoreline nearby.  And always the gentle clanging of an old buoy in the cove, the same one that was there when the sisters were young and spry, and the whales came by every August.  Handyman Harry Carey, Jr. is the one fly in the ointment.  While injecting a perhaps useful counterpoint of noise and gruffness to this gentle movie, not to mention a bit of lament about how times are changing (tourists with their autos have discovered the island), he is quite profane.  The movie didn't need this jarring quality, but I suppose a reputation as a ""G""-type movie (my VHS is unrated) would be considered the kiss of death to adult viewers and yet this subtle a movie too boring for kids.

Such an extraordinary and rich story this movie enfolds.  The contrast of youth and age; the way life ""fools"" us (a constant refrain with Libby); the sorrow of a long life and yet the promise of good things worth living for, and the perfect photography which precisely complements the movie's moods.  This is superb filmmaking and acting.  Understated but clear, this show will haunt your quiet moments.  The older you get, the more you'll understand it.

Early in the movie Sarah asks Libby, who seems more irritable than usual, if something's wrong.  ""I'm all right,"" Libby replies in a way that the viewer finds out can be taken two ways, ""just a touch of November in my bones.""  But there's always hope that a memento of their youth, the passage of the whales every August, will be there in their dotage.

This was the last or one of the last movies the principals in it made.  It is a beautiful farewell and all the more touching because of it.",1153958400,39,3227,4.61578947368421
303133,4,6300984869,"i almost never enjoy plotless all-character talky movies, but this is a rare exception. bette davis and lillian gish as sisters facing their final days, and great supporting work from vincent price and ann sothern. beautifully directed by lindsay anderson. very slow going, not for everybody, but if youve seen or read any chekhov (& liked it), this is a good movie for you.",1146614400,5,374,4.859375
303134,5,6300984869,"Was not aware of this film (or the play) before stumbling across it at a rental shop. Both my girlfriend and I are residents of, and share passionate interests in, the New England coast. With her away in Europe on holiday, I rented this in hopes of coastal scenery that would allow me to dwell on our mutual interests. I received a stunning visual treat and so much more. A very delicate play, filmed against a very bold, delicious scenery, with sensational performances. Yes, it's tempo is slow, and as Bette Davis' character, Libby, states, ""I feel November in my bones"" although it is clearly August by the calendar's gauge, the story indicates the struggle of a half full, or half empty glass, as time draws life closer to it's end. The richness of now, and the treasures of yesterday are examined in such simple, yet handsomely illustrated parallels.

If you are a fan of Bette Davis, you will be thrilled by a bravo performance of a bittered soul, envious of her sisters still thriving passion for life. I knew of, but had never seen Lillian Gish. I was mesmerized, enchanted and deeply touched by her stunning portrayal of Sarah, who states defiantly to her sister, ""I am nowhere near ready for my life to be over."" Sarah has the ability to remain reverent to the past, kissing her long deceased husbands picture every day while dusting, and thrive on the new days glory, and her hopes for future whale sightings and dreams of a picture window with which to enjoy dinner by moonlight. A difficulty in marking the time setting of the story was my only nagging question. At one point someone comments of the number of cars appearing lately on ""the island"" (off Maine's rocky coast) as being ""more than Eleanor Roosevelt has causes."" Which prompts the handyman to comment ""seems a bit follish since ya can't drive a mile in any direction before ya fall into the ocean!"" One assumes it is set in the early 50's. There are so many lines so worthy of note, so many poignant scenes, enriching character studies, and breathtaking visuals, that this tender little screen adaptation, is a rainy evening well spent. Far from my usual fare, but very near to my heart.",1144972800,7,2162,4.659685863874346
303135,5,6300984869,"I originally saw ""The Whales of August"" in early 1988 and was struck by its quiet beauty and the very realstic relationship between the two sisters, Libby (Bette Davis) and Sarah (Lillian Gish). Now, almost 20 years later, ""Whales"" is all the more poignant since four of its leads--David, Gish, Vincent Price (charming and still so suave) and Ann Sothern (nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar)--have left us. The story is simple: it begins in the early 20th century (we're left to wonder exactly when) as young Libby, Tish (played first by Sothern's real life daughter, Tisha Sterling, and then by Sothern herself), and Sarah welcome the whales' annual August visit to the Maine coast. Then, what was once sepia becomes blazing color, and we're now in the ""present"" (again, we're unsure exactly when. Libby listens to a snippet of Arthur Godfrey on the radio, and there's mention of Eleanor Roosevelt. Could it be the late 40's/early 50's?). Libby and Sarah are living together, still in the rustic Maine cliff house, and their relationship is clearly established from the get-go. Sarah is ""busy, busy, busy,"" enjoying life for all it still offers. Libby, now blind, has obviously had a stroke and rails at the ""unfairness"" of life. Both are comforted by Memory, and in two separate scenes, Davis and Gish really show us what subtle screen acting is all about. Alone in her bedroom, Libby takes a keepsake lock of her late husband's hair and slowly caresses her face with it (I challenge you to keep a dry eye as you watch this). Later, Sarah celebrates her wedding anniversary with a photo of her soldier husband, Philip, and toasts his philsophy of ""passion and truth."" It's a touching moment and couldn't have been played more effectively.

Vincent Price is completely charming as a Russian gentleman down on his luck, and Ann Sothern is a delightful revelation. But The Whales of August belongs to Bette and Lillian. I must admit, I was rather shocked to see how ""Miss D"" had aged (this was her first film after experiencing a real-life stroke), but there's a solid beauty to her ravaged features. This woman has LIVED, and what we're seeing is as strong and enduring as the Maine coastline.

MGM has outdone itself with the lovely DVD transfer, but the lack of extras left me a bit flat. Nonetheless, I'm happy to add this to my growing collection.

Sadly, we'll never see the likes of Davis, Gish, or Price again. I'm happy I had the opportunity to enjoy all three in their later prime (I'm 53). Gee, I was practically raised on Vincent Price horror films! And Bette scared the pants off me in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" and ""The Nanny."" Hard to believe they're gone...just the thought brings a serious lump to my throat.",1138320000,23,2742,4.780590717299578
303136,5,6300984869,"This beautiful 1987 film of two sisters, now in their 80's, who have vacationed in a cottage in Maine for half a century, is a gem.

  Lillian Gish, in her last film role, shined as Sarah, who is still open to all the wonderful things that change and romance can bring. Sarah still celebrates her wedding anniversary to a man who died in the war over 40 years ago. Miss Gish's sincerity of the character comes through and warms us all. She had been in a total of 103 films in her career.

  Bette Davis, in her second from the last film role, makes a major hit as Libby, the cantankerous sister that rages at the world,  impending death, and her estrangement with her daughter. She also had 103 films to her credit.

  Vincent Price is marvelous as Mr. Maranov, an elderly man alone who was related to the Romanov's of Russia. How tender his portrayal is, so genuine! Mr. Price died in 1993, some say of a broken heart because of the passing of his wife, Coral Brown.

  And how cute was Ann Sothern in the role of Tisha, the two women's life-long friend!  This was also Miss Sothern's last role, though she didn't pass away until 2001.

  Harry Carey, who played Joshua Brackett, the handy man, is the only surviving major memeber of this cast. You might remember him from the John Wayne film ""Three Godfather's"". He is still active. On IMDb.com I noticed his most current film was this year. Hope he continues to go strong!

  My only regret is that this movie didn't have any special features and interviews. You must include this in your DVD library.",1128556800,12,1554,4.462633451957295
303137,5,6300984869,"Great transfer and a great film. Lillian Gish's performance is a great insight for those who haven't reached their later years. She is wise and graceful, firm yet fair in her dealings with those around her and, especially, her difficult sister (Bette Davis). The story is of two sisters who have lived long and full lives now dealing with the realities of their advanced years and the remembrances of their long ago childhood spent in the very house on Cape Cod where Ms. Gish now lives. The dynamics between Gish and Davis reflects very real people. It is at times very tender and at times very tense. Yes, sisters yet very different human beings.

Vincent Price plays the older version of the part he played in 'Lauara.' He plays the sincere lady's man who has fallen on hard times, worn around the edges but one who can still charm the ladies.

The scenery is stunning. In fact, you can watch it for only the visuals. When this film is over one will not easily forget its impact and beauty. A keeper!",1127692800,44,1003,4.535911602209945
303138,5,6300984869,"I recently purchased the DVD edition of _The Whales of August_.  I had seen the film before, and I had remembered what a great movie I thought it was, and now that I've seen it again, I realized that the film is one of the best made.  There's no action, no special effects.  This film stands on merit and nobility.  It's a story, a real story.  It tells of two aging sisters and how they view the latter years of their lives.  They are old, yes, but these characters represent people who see that each minute of their lives is important, even those in their end years.  It's not a story of old people giving up.  It's a story about how life can still be fulfilling and rewarding up until the very end.  Mr. Robert Horton stated in an editorial that this was more of a ""tribute"" than a true film.  As a drama teacher, I can say that he doesn't know beans about what films, characterization, and acting truly are.  This film is much more than touching.  It is truly poignant.  It has a meaning that is applicable to anyone.  Life is what you make of it, no matter what age you are.",1127520000,6,1079,4.2254901960784315

The passing of quiet days, the extraordinary relationship between two so, oh so, differente sisters, the small vanities, the memories, all beautifully, beautifully acted.  Davis, Gish, Price, Sothern, what a magical crew for such a magical, sweet, beautiful, little movie!

303170,5,6300984869,"Watching this film after several years was something of a bitterwsweet experience - it looks wonderful on DVD - it's beautifully photographed and has a subtle, haunting musical score. But its reason for being is as the final showcase for the acting of two screen legends to whom everyone in Hollywood today owes their careers - Lillian Gish, who invented screen acting during the silent era, and Bette Davis, who reinvented it after sound came in.  ""Life fools you,"" Davis says in the film, and she could have been referring to herself - it's hard to believe this is the Bette Davis of JEZEBEL and DARK VICTORY, of THE LITTLE FOXES, NOW VOYAGER, and ALL ABOUT EVE, even of WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Age, illness and, yes, life - had taken their toll on her. But, she has her moments here - oddly enough, her best are without dialog, such as when she brushes a lock of her dead husbands hair across her cheek, while Gish has the lovely ""passion and truth"" monologue.  Ah well - they don't make 'em like these gals anymore!",1082851200,12,1028,4.521505376344086

It is one of the last films of Bette Davis and Vincent Price.  They gave magnificent performances that I still treasure.  I have waited a long time for this to come on DVD!!  One of my favorite quotes is from Bette Davis.  She was told by her sister that ""Memories fade with time.""
