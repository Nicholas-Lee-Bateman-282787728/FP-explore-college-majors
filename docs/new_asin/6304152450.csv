793738,4,6304152450,"James Garner stars as Major Jeff Pike, a U.S. Army intelligence officer in possession of critical information concerning the Allied invasion of Europe.  In a well conceived plot, courtesy of a story from the imagination of Roald Dahl, Garner is abducted from a meeting in neutral Lisbon.

Garner is transported, heavily sedated, to Germany to partake in an elaborate hoax propagated by loyal and intellectual Nazi psychiatrist, Major Gerber played by Rod Taylor.  To glean sensitive details of the attack, Garner is made to believe that six years have elapsed, the war is over and that he's been suffering from amnesia.  In a bogus U.S. hospital setting in alleged occupied Germany, Taylor is given 36 hours to extract the information before diabolical SS Colonel Schack played by Werner Peters will use more aggresive interrogation techniques.

The charade is enhanced by Eva Narie Saint playing nurse Anna Hedler who is actually a concentration camp survivor aiding Taylor to maintain her freedom.  The wily Garner soon sees through the plot and with the aid of Saint, escapes after muddling up the scheme.

Peters and Taylor, at odds throughout the film eventually have a showdown after the principled Taylor helps Saint and Garner escape.  Col. Schack is obsessed with their recapture as the try to cross the border into Switzerland.  Garner and Saint are aided by an entrepreneurial German homeguard Sergeant Ernst played by none other than John Banner, better known as Hogan's Heroes unforgetable Sgt. Schultz.",1161302400,8,1516,5.180327868852459
793739,4,6304152450,"In the category of War Films, this one is more of a thriller. James Garner stars as a kidnapped American officer who, while recovering in a military hospital, is led to believe that he is suffering from amnesia.  The key to his recovery is to recall the details of the Allied invasion France.  The twist is that Nazi's actually have him captive and have set up an elaborate charade to convince Garner that the war has been over for years in hopes of discovering the Normandy invasion plans.

Rod Taylor plays the part of a German doctor masquarading as an American doctor attempting to coax memories from Garner.  Taylor's character is very sympathetic to Garner's plight and half heartedly attempts to draw the information from him.  Although Taylor's character is that of a German playing the part of an American, it is difficult to see him as anything but an American.  This is even more suprising as Taylor was Australian.

Eva Marie Saint plays Garner's attending nurse who is torn between assisting Garner and keeping herself out of a concentration camp.

Werner Peters reprises his oft-played role as a Nazi officer. You have seen him play virtually the same role in THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, and THE SECRET WAR OF HARRY FRIGG.  In 36 HOURS he is bent on rushing the carefully scipted amnesia scenario and cracking Garner in order to discover the D-Day invasion plans.  In doing so he shows his true colors as a self serving and glory seeking individual.  He explains this to the German doctor when he blatantly admits that any failure will be blamed on the doctor whereas success will lauded on Peters.

Actor John Banner also makes a pre-Hogan's Heroes appearance in this film. Even though Banner wears a home guard uniform and patrols a fence other than that of Stalag 13, Banner is still lovable Sergeant Schultz.

The plot of this movie has been compared to the elaborate schemes hatched in episodes of Mission Impossible.  In fact, 36 HOURS was remade as a television movie by Ted Turner as BREAKING POINT in the late 1980s.

There was some location shooting in Portugal and additional second unit exterior filming in Germany.  However the bulk of 36 HOURS was filmed in California with exterior shots in nearby Yosemite Park.  Take note of the German army uniforms with the oversized insignia and shiny stahlhelm helmets.  These uniforms were straight out of the MGM wardrobe.  Television series such as COMBAT! also made use of these one-size-fits-all uniforms.

This movie has been difficult to come by even when it was only available in VHS.  In fact prior to acquiring the DVD the last time I saw this movie was on late night television 30 years ago.  Despite reviews about some DVDs with diminished clarity, my copy was intact and absolutely clear.",1160265600,21,2791,4.8071278825995805
793740,3,6304152450,This is a film with an interesting premise that unfortunately runs out of steam midway through. Garner fans should probably see it at some point. May be hard to find as it's apparently not out yet on DVD.,1126915200,5,204,4.394736842105263
793741,4,6304152450,"James Garner is excellent in this WWII thriller about Major Pike, a man who is drugged and kidnapped on a mission in Lisbon, which was a hub of intrigue during the war years. He is taken to an ""American hospital"" in Germany, where they tell him he has amnesia, and has been hospitalized for years, in hopes of getting information on where and when the Allied invasion will take place. With some hair dye and eye drops that blur his vision, and a newspaper that is dated ""May 15, 1950"", Maj. Pike is disoriented, and believes the elaborate hoax, but has an uneasy feeling that all is not as it seems.

The people who pretend to be ""helping him"" are Eva Marie Saint as his nurse, Anna, who has a numbered tattoo from Auschwitz, and will do anything not to be sent back there, and Rod Taylor as Major Gerber, the psychiatrist. Werner Peters is the evil SS Agent Schack, whose only interest is in his own promotion. The main thrust of the plot is how Maj. Pike is to survive, and how he can keep the Nazis in the dark about D-Day. There are a few twists to the story, which for the most part holds water, though there is a slight discrepancy that to me is now obvious, but I have seen this film countless times, and do not think I noticed it until the 3rd viewing.

The taut script is based on Roald Dahl's ""Beware of the Dog"", and the direction by George Seaton is nicely paced with many tense moments. Dimitri Tiomkin composed the soundtrack, and the black & white cinematography by Philip Lathrop was shot on location in Portugal, Germany and Yosemite National Park. Total running time is 115 minutes.",1124236800,35,1600,4.420338983050847
793742,4,6304152450,"If you haven't seen the ""amnesia plot,"" then by all means see 36  HOURS.  It's one of the best plots of all time!  The plot was also employed  in a movie called BREAKING POINT, as well as in a two-part (that is,  two-hour) Mission Impossible program.  In dramatic terms, the Mission  Impossible show ranks the best, BREAKING POINT second, and 36 HOURS last.  But once you've seen the premise, then 36 HOURS is by far the most  intelligent of the three presentations.  Garner and Saint are superb in  their roles. Leonard Maltin is DEAD WRONG in saying that the film  ""peters out"" as it goes along.  What he might be saying is that  once you've grokked the fabulous plot, then it's downhill.  But after all,  there's no topping this plot!  So the movie has to unwind some.  36 HOURS  does the best unwinding, because it plays variations on the plot, and  you're kept in suspense about who really knows what.  BREAKING POINT, while  more dramatic at first, ""peters out"" much more rapidly; in fact,  we don't care any more after the first half hour.  The Mission Impossible  sequence (which I only saw on TV--somehow they haven't produced it for DVD  or video, though I'm sure they will someday) keeps the suspense up as only  ""Mission Impossible"" can do.  Bottom line: if you haven't seen  any of them, then by all means get 36 HOURS!  After you've seen that,  you'll probably want to see the other two too.",965347200,37,1405,4.566801619433198

It is a black and white film and a classic.  Garner's character takes a trip into a setting of tomorrow when the war is over and he begins to recall his past, letting out what he figures are now declassified government secrets, and then working to convince the enemy otherwise, or trying to, after he realizes he's been had.  I love the way Garner's character figures out the timeline.  Eva Marie Saint portrays a woman hardened through the hazards of war and imprisonment.  It's not a special effects movie, nor fast paced.  It's just classic old time Hollywood.",1503446400,,705,4.503937007874016

Set during WW2, just before D-Day and the nasty Nazis have a plan to get the info out of our hero, Jim boy. Enough of the story.

Rod Taylor in a great major supporting role is the sympathetic doctor who treats Jim in a US Base hospital after the war has been over for several years with Eva Marie Saint as Jim's personal nurse. Gee, that was more of the story or is it?

A crisp thriller with great actors even to the minor supporting cast. A film that can be viewed time and again just for the sheer pleasure.

794048,5,6304152450,"An excellent World War II thriller, ""36 Hours"" features stellar performances from James Garner, Eva Marie Saint and Rod Taylor. This unusual thriller is something you might expect Christopher Nolan to come up with today (although Nolan's wouldn't be quite so straight forward).

SPOILERS:

Garner plays Major Jefferson Pike who wakes up in an Allied hospital post-war in 1950. Pike can't remember anything after 1944 just before the D-Day invasion and his doctor (Rod Taylor) tries to help him recall the time he's lost.

The only problem is that it's 1944 and Pike is really in a faux Allied hospital--he's really being treated by the Germans in an effort to discover the D-Day plans. Pike becomes increasingly suspicious as pressure is applied to help him recall the plans. The Nazi's only have 36 hours before the invasion begins.

END OF SPOILERS:

Based on an original story Luis Vance and Carl K. Hittleman  ( ""Beware of the Dog"" by Roald Dahl also cited as a source was discovered after the story was purchased and the script written that this project also resembled the Dahl story. MGM the production studio bought the story to prevent any lawsuits) the film is a marvelous example of old fashioned suspenseful filmmaking. Writer/director George Seaton does a fine job with the material which runs a brisk 115 minutes.

Patricia Neal (married to Dahl at the time made her husband and MGM aware of the similarities) was offered the role finally played by Eva Marie Saint in the film although it appears that James Garner was the first choice for the lead in the film. The black and white photography is moody and Seaton's (""Airport"", ""The Counterfeit Traitor"") direction keeps the action briskly moving along.

Warner Archive presents a marvelous restoration of the film. Blacks are solid as is detail and depth exceptional as well. I know there are those out there that don't watch black and white movies but you do yourself a disservice by doing so. The black and white photography here only adds to the suspicious circumstances that Pike finds himself in. Audio sounds fine with dialog clear with no pops or crackles and nice depth for the score but, keep in mind, this is an older film that has some source limitations build in.

Unfortunately, there isn't any commentary tracks or featurettes on the production of the film. That's unfortunate because it would be fascinating to learn more about the production history of the film and Seaton' career as a writer (he started as a gag man working with The Marx Brothers as well as providing material--uncredited--on ""The Wizard of Oz"").

Once again I will remind Warner Archive that I would gladly do a podcast they could use as a commentary track. I'm cheap. Honest. ;)

This 1964 thriller is well made with strong performances. Warner Archive have done a marvelous job of restoring the film. I realize that most of the money on these releases is spent on the restoration (and usually there isn't new material produced for these sets--it is often imported over from DVD releases but in this case, there wasn't any) and I appreciate that, I just wish there was a way to put together a commentary track or featurette that could expand on the production. We do get the original trailer. Even without any special features, this is a terrific thriller worth picking up.

We get close captioning for the film in English but there aren't any other optional subtitles or audio tracks.

Highly recommended.",1491955200,5,3457,4.868824531516184

794130,5,6304152450,"I hadn't seen this since it's release in the 1960's - and despite the film industry's technological advances over the past fifty-plus years, they could not have made this a better movie now in 2016 than they did back then.  As a matter of fact, they likely would have ruined it with millions of dollars in special effects and the inclusion of gratuitous sex and a large expansion of totally unnecessary cast members.

This is a truly excellent piece of work, based upon the fascinating concept of how a seemingly simple, irrelevant at the time occurrence (in this case, an accidental paper cut on a man's finger) could be responsible for influencing the course of world history.

There is a fine development of an efficiently limited number of main characters that we can quickly come to know and understand - so, everything they do and say becomes important quite early on and we are easily able to become deeply invested.

794211,4,6304152450,"Released in 1964 and shot in B&W, 36 Hours takes place during WWII right before the Allied Normandy invasion. James Garner plays Major Pike, who has detailed info on the attack. Hes drugged & kidnapped by the Germans and wakes up in a supposed US military hospital where hes told its six years after the war. Will he discover the ruse before inadvertently revealing details about D-Day? Eva Marie Saint plays his nurse, Rod Taylor his doctor and Werner Peters a Nazi. John Banner (aka Sgt. Schultz) is also on hand.

The best thing about this movie is the ingenious con of the plot and the anticipation of how Pike will figure out whats really happening and how hell escape. Its similar to 1958s The Young Lions and 1964s The Americanization of Emily in that its a WWII drama/thriller shot in B&W. The plots so intriguing that its been borrowed for other movies and TV shows, like three episodes of the Star Trek franchise (The Next Generation, Voyager and Enterprise). While not great like The Young Lions its well done. The dated score detracts, however, as does the B&W photography.

The movie runs 115 minutes and was shot in Lisbon, Portugal, and Wawona Hotel and grounds, Yosemite National Park, California.

Garner is tasked to check out an informant to make sure that the cover story has not been uncovered by the Germans.  The Germans come up with a diabolically fancy plan - kidnap Garner and convince him that it is 1950 and that the war ended with an Allied success.

Will the Germans succeed? Well, we know how the war turned out, but watching Garner fall into the snare of the German psychologist and then deal with the consequences is enjoyable, and there is a surprising turn at the end by John Banner - Sergeant Schultz from Hogan's Heroes.

I have to cringe at some dialogue lines that sound too flippant, but I do believe that's a script problem, not the actors' fault.

The hope is that Garner's character will discuss the invasion plans as part of the treatment of his alleged amnesia.

794880,5,6304152450,"Now here is an intelligent, taut spy thriller set in WW2.  This review will try for brevity and succinctness. No plot giveaways here!

James Garner is an American intelligence officer with knowledge of the forthcoming Allied invasion of France. He is posted to Lisbon to milk a contact in the German embassy. Neutral Portugal was a hotbed of intrigue back then.. (Remember Bogey, Bergman and those letters of transit?). JG doesn't get very far, is kidnapped and wakes up in a German hospital! The Germans try to fool JG with an ingenious ruse. Rod Taylor is excellent as a diligent and conscientious American-born German doctor and Eva Marie Saint impresses as a nurse. Was she truly a concentration camp survivor? Viewers must remember that JG is no rear echelon babe in the woods but a trained intelligence guy.  He was prepared for possible capture and interrogation. There is one German slip up and one major plot hint. Watch and listen to RT and JG closely! This viewer hit his rewind button often. Who beats who at the cat and mouse game? That is ALL this review will reveal!

""36 Hours"" is very well done and tightly directed. Not one scene is wasted right down to that fork in the road fadeout.  The supporting cast and background settings are first rate! Check out that hospital! Hollywood still made black and white films in '64! And yes John Banner (from ""Hogan's Heroes"" !) is here as a corrupt German cop but enough of that! Watch the movie to find out his role, if he really had one, and who, if anyone, gets to live happily ever after.",1305936000,,1550,4.621818181818182
794881,4,6304152450,"James Garner, as an actor, comes off as one of them terrifically grounded souls. He oozes practicality and levelheadedness, and if there were a fire or an evacuation or some other dire emergency, you get the sense that he'll step up to the plate and won't lose his cool and won't forget about you. That's the sort of presence he exudes. So his movies tend to have that extra dose of believability, even when the plot is wildly preposterous. James Garner just sells it, man. He does it again in 36 HOURS. Him and his everyman mojo.

Having said that, it's Rod Taylor who steals this film.

Those dratted Nazis will stoop to anything, will even slip a mickey in a guy's drink (and the universal man code dictates that you never mess with a guy's drink). With D-Day impending,  the Germans are frantic for any leads regarding date and place of the Allied invasion. In Lisbon, intelligence officer U.S. Army Major Jefferson Pike is drugged and nabbed and transported to a site elaborately staged to resemble an Allied hospital base in Germany. Jefferson Pike wakes up to the reassuring sight of cheerful Americans staffing the hospital. He's informed that the war is over, that their side had won, that six years had elapsed. Pike believes that it's now May 15, 1950, and that he's a convalescing amnesiac unable to recall the past six years. He likes his all-American physician (Rod Taylor), likes him and trusts him. Pike is disarmed enough, and thoroughly buys into the charade, that he doesn't think twice about divulging vital secrets concerning D-Day. He thinks he's reminiscing. The Nazis are frantically taking notes. Loose lips sinking ships.

36 HOURS is a taut psychological wartime thriller, and that's saying something, considering that the plot is laid out to the viewer from jump. We're made immediately aware of what the Germans are up to. So, from that sense, the viewer loses out on an even stronger connection to the lead character. It probably would've resonated more if, like Major Pike, we're initially groping in the fog, us going on that same journey of discovery.

But never mind. This film, for the most part, is so well put together. It's crucial that the screenplay isn't dumbed down, because this is essentially a cat-and-mouse game being played by several of the characters, two of which are exceedingly sharp. The false reality constructed by the Germans needed to be meticulously detailed and convincing enough to sucker in a sharp operator like Pike - and it is. The suspense is generated and paced mostly by the story, instead of gimmicks such as, say, the sudden jangling crescendo of the film score or tricky camera pans or whatever. 36 HOURS is fueled by Garner and Taylor's performances, and the film's strongest thread concerns the complex relationship between their characters. Garner is watchable, like always. But Rod Taylor is brilliant in how he makes his Nazi-affiliated psychologist, Major Gerber, so damn charming and sympathetic. It's worth noting that the dastardly psychologist seems more open-minded than our hero. Major Gerber approaches with objectivity. Having studied Pike for months in preparatory of the great ruse, Gerber has even come to admire Pike. Pike, for his part, finds it hard to overcome his prejudice when he meets Otto Schack and hears his German accent. Not that you can blame Pike, I suppose. For him, the war was as if it were only  yesterday.

Eva Marie Saint is very good as the fractured Anna Hedler, a concentration camp survivor and Pike's personal nurse, and her performance is opaque enough and brittle enough that you weren't quite sure on which side she'd fall. And with Rod Taylor so charismatic, the film required an honest-to-gosh nasty, hissable villain. Enter Werner Peters as the slimy, ambitious SS official, Otto Schack. You wish nothing but awful things for this despicable worm.

I do wish that the great deception were sustained longer because I was really savoring those tension-fraught scenes. But once Pike got an inkling, it's not too long before he figures it all out. And then the story shifts to a new platform of suspense, the I-know-that-you-know-that-I-know sort. And that's almost as good.

Sucks then that the final half hour degenerates into a generic escape film.",1304553600,4,4266,4.946927374301676
794882,4,6304152450,"I have always enjoyed this film although it may seem inplausible; I mean to what extent would someone go to find out the invasion details of another? to the point of pretending that the war is over, the US is on German soil, and everyone speaks English but all is not as it seems. I am like the other person who said that each time he sees it, he notices something new. In this instance, it is the cut he checks out. I also was looking for the young troop who clicked his heels like a German troop and gave the whole thing away. But from the first time I saw this until now, I have truly enjoyed watching this movie. You can see the loyalties of the principles involved. For Rod Taylor(Maj Garber), it is seeing the success of his project after working with amnesia victims; For Schack,the SS officer(Werner Peters), it is just getting promoted at any means possible. For Anna(Eva Marie Saint), it means not to ever return to a concentration camp, and For Maj Pike(James Garner), it is to find his way out of this seemingly impossible maze. then once he saw the light, to get out of it.  The funny thing out of this film is Garner told the truth but Scheck didn't believe it one bit. What surprised me to an extent is the various folks in England who were on the side of the enemy and was happy to pass any info along. I wasn't surprised at the older German guard making money and getting gold off of people in order to escape. great movie.",1304208000,8,1440,4.294117647058823
794883,3,6304152450,"This 1964 movie starts out as riveting as a good Twilight Zone episode and continues this way for at least half the movie. If it had ended not long after this it would have rated much higher.  It doesn't unfortunately and continues to drag on long after its intrigue is over.  So while the initial idea was a very good one it  finally degenerates into the kind of drek I usually associate with James Garner movies and some Hollywood films of this era: cliche acting, by-the-numbers dialogue, and predictable screenplay writing.

What interested me originally was the fact that it was based on a Roald Dahl story but you'd find a lot more entertainment picking up one of his collections than inwatching ""36 Hours"". Roald Dahl's adult short stories are clever, often hilarious, occasionally sublime.  I'd like to recommend any of them over this movie.. although admittedly the first half of the film could make it worth watching.

But what he doesn't know is that everybody there is German and trained to have American accents and they all want him to reveal what the Americans have planned for D-Day.

Killer idea but execution only gets it a ""B"" grade.  It should have spent more time focusing on the middle story than doing the typical ending for the last third of the tale.  The cat and mouse game was the most interesting as well as how they fooled the James Garner character in the beginning.  That said, it's a solid story with an impressive cast.  The hospital set up and the German attempt to trick him into thinking its several years after D-Day is the best part.

Because Garner knows the detail plan of the Invasion which will be in Normandy, and the Nazis don't know for sure, he is worked upon by a German doctor who colors his hair, blurs his eyes so he needs glasses, and arranges every detail to make it look like 6 years have passed and the war is over. Under quesitoning, Garner is tricked into giving the details of the invasion plans which takes place on June 6, 1944, and it is only June 1, 1944.
  The trick would have worked if Garner did not incur a minute cut on his finger looking at a map before he was drugged. He got salt in the wound as he was eating at this fake facility after hours of questioning and realized it doesn't take 6 years for a cut to heal.
  Then, the cat and mouse game goes on as Garner now tells the Nazis that he knew all along he was being duped and and its up to them to believe the info, or not, what he gave them. An S.S. officer doesn't believe it, so he goes along with the Nazi high command that the attack will happen at the Port of Calay where the Nazis had mobilized their troops.
  The German doctor later helps Garner, and the Jewish nurse who was released from a concentration camp on the provision that she helps the Nazis in this ruse. The last part of the film deals with Garner and the lady's escape to freedom.

794952,4,6304152450,"For ingenious pitches, 36 Hours is hard to beat: James Garner's military intelligence officer gets knocked out cold in Lisbon on the eve of D-Day and regains consciousness to discover its 1950 and he's been suffering recurring amnesia for the past six years. Unable to remember his friends or even his wife, his best hope of a cure is to try to remember what was on his mind just before his accident. Only it's not 1950, and the last thing on his mind was the details of the invasion, which Rod Taylor's German psychiatrist is very interested in...

Like Garner, the film spills the beans rather quickly, so it's not exactly a spoiler to reveal the premise, though thankfully the film still has a few good tricks up its sleeve as the plot twists and turns like a twisty turny thing as he tries to convince them he was lying (though it's perhaps a little too lucky that Werner Peters' evil SS man on the case is so pragmatically career-minded in his determination to take all the credit for Taylor's work that he doesn't pass the information on). While the film inevitably ends up as a chase thriller, it's still a rather good one, benefiting from strong characterisation, from Rod Taylor's 'good German' to John Banner's scene-stealing turn as a corrupt border guard, and it's nice to see Sig Rumann turn up briefly at the end as another border guard. Director George Seaton, one of those forgotten craftsmen, handles the material (partially based on a Roald Dahl story) well, Dmitri Tiomkin provides a strong score and the film looks particularly good in WHV's black and white 2.35:1 widescreen transfer. The only extras are the theatrical trailer and trailers for Up Periscope and the Americanization of Emily. Terrifically entertaining, but whatever you do don't confuse it with the dire 1989 TV movie remake Breaking Point.",1232496000,2,1827,4.818471337579618

James Garner excels as a captured US Major and Rod Taylor manages to convince us he's a German officer even though he speaks educated English through most of the movie.  The smallest detail takes on big meaning in this movie and you'll need to watch it twice before you catch on.

794959,2,6304152450,"Please note: The two stars above do not indicate my verdict on the film itself, but rather the odd transfer to DVD provided by the folks at Warner Home Video. For most of the running time this DVD looks just fine, with a good grey scale, fine contrast and a sharp image. Thankfully, white speckles are also quite absent, which is certainly not always the case when it comes to transfers of classic product from Warner.

But in almost all of the darker scenes throughout the film, the focus goes way off, especially damaging in the right half of the screen. And when it comes to the final escape sequence with Garner and Saint, this irritating double contour softness continues for half a reel or so, effectively ruining much of the suspense.

If this problem is a defect that exists on all surviving materials in the film vaults, then Warner should have had the decency to warn potential consumers with at least a sticker on the cover. But my guess is that this blurry jinx could have been corrected with some proper quality attention before the discs were made and distributed. If Warner have the guts and will, they ought to recall this DVD pronto before its domestic street date on June 5, and make a hopefully new transfer available as soon as possible.",1180483200,33,1257,4.607142857142857
794960,3,6304152450,This movies stars James Garner as a WW2 military officer with a knowlwdge of top secret plans. The story unfolds as he awakes in a hospital and is being treated for physical injuries and amnesia. Or is he..??? Just what type of hospital is he in and who is in charge.......the Allies or the Germans...???? Tensions rise as Garner slowly suspects the truth and plays a game of wits with the enemy. Good acting all around. Not an Academy Award winner but not a bomb either. A good addition to a WW2 film library.,1172793600,7,510,4.4361702127659575

Cast is first rate with Garner in a serious lead, and premise of American being kidnapped before D-Day by the Germans who employ an elaborate ruse to make him think the war is won, and he must recount the D-Day plans in order to regain his memory, is quite inventive. The escape from the faux military hospital lets the viewer down a bit but is an interesting and very watchable film none the less. The relationship between the American and his nurse is quite intense, in a non romantic way. BluRay version is an excellent transfer.",1506470400,,565,4.603960396039604
