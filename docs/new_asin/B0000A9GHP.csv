1904515,5,B0000A9GHP,"This is a collection of four short narratives with a link story about the mystery of the creepy old house where all are set. In the first, a writer of horror stories fears he is going mad when the lunatic murderer he is writing about suddenly appears in his life and starts to stalk him. In the second, a respectable retired unmarried stockbroker is thrown off balance when he comes across a waxwork of a young woman that reminds him of his lost love. In the third, a young woman is hired as a governess and is puzzled to discover that her employer has forbidden his sweet little girl to play with dolls... In the fourth, a hammy old horror movie actor goes off shopping for a vampire's cloak and gets more than he bargained for. His subsequent disappearance has brought a Scotland Yard detective sniffing around whose investigations are a basis for the slender linking story.
Five stars first of all because of the title. If it isn't the best title of any movie ever, what on earth is? And you know you're into a treat when you watch the rest of the credits: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt... But my most vivid memory is still one of NOT seeing it. When it was released I was a wee boy of seven or eight, a good ten years younger than the certificate said I had to be to go and see it at the cinema. But I saw it advertised and was, I remember, desperately frustrated: a film with such a title could not possibly fail, my small boy's bloodthirsty imagination insisted, to be the most brilliant ever made. Older and perhaps wiser (and able to watch it as often as I like without troubling the law), I'll now concede it my well not be the most brilliant, or even anywhere near the scariest, film ever made. But I think my seven-year old self would not have been disappointed by these lovely gruesome little tales (and would not, I confidently conjecture have suffered significant psychological harm from seeing them). And even now, at my present relatively disenchanted age, I can watch it with unmitigated and not particularly guilty pleasure.",1080691200,15,2087,4.568
1904516,2,B0000A9GHP,"Sadly, The House That Dripped Blood doesn't have a very solid foundation. The termites of time have chewed away at the film's frame and the result is a film that sags when it should chill. Overall, ""House"" doesn't chill the way it used to but then perhaps that's more to do with the explicit quality of the many movies out there now. Before you give me a ""not helpful vote"" hear me out.

I'm very fond of the low-budget but crisply directed series of films that Amicus productions released during the 70's. Unfortunately, The House That Dripped Blood isn't one of their better titles. Stick with the imaginative Asylum and Tales From The Crypt. Both these anthology films are much bolder and better made than this entry.

""House"" comes off looking like an English knock-off of Night Gallery. While there's a very good cast buried in this film, the writing by original Psycho scripe Robert Bloch doesn't quite gel. Denholm Elliot (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Jon Pertwee (Dr. Who)and Ingrid Pitt do their best given the material but there isn't much here to begin with. Compare this to the TV movie ""The Night Stalker"" with Darren McGavin or ""Trilogy of Terror"" (another anthology film but made for TV). Both of these films are superior to ""House"" despite the splendid production design.

It's a pity. The framing story for this anthology promised much more than it could deliver. A famous horror film actor (Jon Pertwee)has disappeared and one of Scotland Yard's finest is sent down to refer on the case. It turns out that the house where the actor was staying has a curse on it. Bad things happen to everyone that has rented it from A. J. Stoker (in an all too obvious tip of the hat to Bram Stoker and Dracula) so it's no surprise that those that move in never get the chance to move out.

The framing story features a detective called in to locate a missing actor (Jon Pertwee). The detective hears about the haunted history of the home where the actor was staying. The first tale starts promisingly enough. A writer (Denholm Elliot)suffering from writer's block is hoping to jump-start his new novel about a strangler with a change of scenery. His wife doesn't care for the place but it suits the writer's personality to a tee. Fiction intrudes on reality when the writer begins seeing the murderer from his novel everywhere. His wife doesn't see anything. When the writer nearly strangles his wife, she insists that he seek help. Needless to say, things end badly.

The second tale involves a retired stockbroker (Peter Cushing giving a solid performance as always). He rents the house for the isolation and escape from the real world. He discovers a wax museum which would have seemed at home in the film House of Wax. He recognizes one of the figures; it resembles a former lover that he and his best friend fought over years ago. When Cushing's friend shows up to visit, he takes him into town. They visit the wax museum. The friend is mesmerized by the likeness of his former lover and can't leave the town.

The third tale involves a little girl isolated from all other children and her very frightened father who hires a teacher to tutor her. The third tale like the first two have a lot of potential. The telling of the tale is so poor, though, that it's hard to develop any sympathy for any of the characters or care what happens to them.

The fourth and final story provides the resolution for the framing story about the missing actor. It seems that the actor was appearing in a horror film about a vampire. When the actor purchases a cloak that belonged to a real vampire the tongue-in-cheek tale takes a turn for the worst for the actor and his co-star. We discover all too quickly the fate of our actor friend and his co-star when the inspector visits the house.

The transfer and print look exceptional. The colors are rich and the print suffers from minor analog imperfections. The mono sound is occasionally distorted but, on the whole, it sounds pretty good. The extras are minimal but given the nice transfer and widescreen presentation, fans may forgive this oversight. There is a nice interview with one of the producers.

What prevents the film from being effective are the telegraphed endings, hamfisted direction and lackluster writing. All of this is a surprise given the other films that came from Amicus Productions during the 60's and 70's. The film looks like an average television movie and has as much ambition. Horror film veterans like Roy Ward Baker (Asylum and Scars of Dracula) might have given this film a bit more energy and visual inspiration. Unfortunately, House is a relic of an earlier, more innocent time when bell bottoms were king and the few worthwhile horror films were low budget but sharp looking efforts from England.

No doubt I'll get some no helpful votes on this review (particularly if you remember this film fondly as I did)but, sadly, it hasn't aged well at all. The House That Dripped Blood has a couple of creepy and suspenseful moments but most of these are courtesy of the performances of Elliot, Cushing and Lee.",1075420800,12,5109,4.711086226203808
1904517,4,B0000A9GHP,"Don't let the title fool you. There's no blood in this film. THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is a four part horror anthology about an old manor and the untimely deaths of it's occupants. First, Denholm Elliot (Indiana Jones) is a horror writer who moves into the creepy place looking for inspiration for his next book. He draws a picture of a mad strangler character he's imagined. He soon begins seeing him in real life! Next, we have Peter Cushing as a bachelor who visits a wax museum, only to find an old girlfriend's image in a figure of Solome. He becomes obsessed with it. Meanwhile, the owner of the museum has dark secrets of his own. I found this one pretty dull. Number three stars Christopher Lee as a man who moves into the house with his 8yo daughter. He hires a woman as nanny for the girl who soon believes Lee is a heartless monster for keeping his daughter isolated and not allowing her to play with dolls. Is he evil? Or is there something seriously wrong with his daughter? Semi-creepy. Finally, Jon Pertwee (Dr. Who) is a jaded horror movie actor working on his latest vampire epic. Disgusted by the cheesey sets and costumes being used, he goes to an occult shop and buys a ""new"" vampire cape for 13 shillings (cheap). The cape appears to turn him into a real nosferatu! Ingrid Pitt co-stars as Pertwee's seemingly innocent girlfriend, who isn't at all what she seems. This last one's mostly for laughs and reminds me of an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery. All four stories are tied together by a Scotland Yard detective who tries to solve the mysteries. Enjoyable, if not all that scary. It's always cool to see Cushing and Lee in anything. Recommended for diehard horror fans...",1071705600,5,1706,4.5967213114754095
1904518,4,B0000A9GHP,"""The House that Dripped Blood"" appealed to me not from its incredibly cheesy title, nor from the ugly picture on the cover, but from the fact that each of its four segments stars a British actor I really like.  Denholm Elliot, who we see in the first part, was Marcus in the Indiana Jones movies.  Peter Cushing, in segment two, was all kinds of people, from Moff Tarkin in the original Star Wars to Van Helsing in the Hammer films.  Christopher Lee (who is, incidentally, the only one of the four stars still living, at the time that I write this), well.  Who hasn't Christopher Lee been?  The man's everywhere, and definitely one of my all-time favorite actors!  And finally, the third Doctor Who himself, Jon Pertwee, stars in the final bit.
A really flimsy story is used to unify the four parts... as I knew about the uniting factor beforehand, I was expecting it right away to be rather... well, less than perfectly done (would have been better, in my opinion, to just play the four segments with a black screen and a title card before each one begins, and then leave the one thing that the four stories share, the house itself, in the background where it belongs.  That way, if the audience is clever enough (and let me tell you right away that I'm not!), they would notice the house being the same one in all four stories themselves and then each one of them come up with a better reason why than the one the movie gives us.
Of the four segments, I liked the first two best, and the one with Christopher Lee the least.  The Denholm Elliot segment (the first one) has the most creative plot, with a nifty twist I didn't see coming in the last few seconds before it wraps up.  The Cushing one is just creepy.  Lee's was... well, Lee did a great job, but I just didn't care as much for the story.  It was strange for me to see Pertwee, in the final segment, playing someone who wasn't the character I'm used to seeing him play (but did anyone notice that his vampire costume was almost identical to the one he wears on ""Doctor Who""?).  Pertwee's segment is more of a comedy bit than the others.  Not a bad thing at all, but it's just a rather sudden change from the previous three, where there wasn't a lot of humor to be found.
Not much for extras on the DVD... just an interview with the producer (which was okay I guess... if you like that kind of thing) and a hidden trailer.  The quality of the trailer is very poor, but I appreciate the fact that they included it.
I had fun watching ""The House that Dripped Blood"", but I don't know how well it will stand up to repeat viewings.  Only time will tell.  But if you just watch it once and that's all, I don't think you'll feel like you wasted your time.
Carry on Carry on,

1904519,5,B0000A9GHP,"Don't be misled by the title. This is a movie that relies on atmospheric sets, solid acting, and mood-enhancing music to get the job done. As you would expect from a master of the genre such as Robert Bloch, all of the stories are well-crafted (unlike many anthologies, which toss at least one dud into the mix). I was very pleased with the transfer from VHS to DVD. The picture is bright and clear, and I was able to discover many details that were murky on tape. The sound is also crisp, which is especially important with this movie - the music and the odd sound effects are integral to maintaining the spooky atmosphere that permeates the film. The first three stories are serious in tone, but Mr. Bloch lightens-up the proceedings in the final story - where the rubber-faced Jon Pertwee and the buxom Ingrid Pitt are given a chance to camp things up a bit. This very enjoyable movie has thunderstorms, candlelight, creaking doors, shadows, and cobwebs.....but no blood. Let me provide some by giving this film a rating of....""A positive.""",1068163200,30,1043,4.704918032786885
1904520,4,B0000A9GHP,"Ahhh, another juicy Amicus film released by Lion's Gate Entertainment.  With The House That Dripped Blood, we get five fearsome tales involving murder, voodoo, vampires, and generally bad mojo all around.  The tales are centered on a large, old house located just outside of a small town in the English countryside.  Seems a report filed on the disappearance of the most recent owner by the local constabulary has raised some questions within Scotland Yard, prompting a Yard investigator to make the trip for more clarification.  On arriving, the investigator learns that the disappearance of the recent tenant was only the last in a long line of strangeness to come out of that house with regards to past tenants.

The first tale, Method For Murder, involves a horror writer, played by Denholm Elliot, whose most recent literary creation, a maniacal strangler, seems to have come to life, and is lurking in and around the house, being all troublesome and such.

The second story, Waxworks, stars Peter Cushing as a retired investment banker and mysterious goings on at the local wax museum.  Seems one of the wax figures in the museum bares an uncanny resemblance to a woman he used to know.  This one also has a young Joss Ackland, of whom I vaguely recognized until I remembered him as the head bad guy from Lethal Weapon 2.

The third story, Sweets to the Sweet, stars Christopher Lee in a tale about a child with unnatural abilities.  To say anymore would give it away, though you will most likely be able to figure out what's going on before the ending is revealed.

The fourth story, The Cloak, star Jon Pertwee as an egotistical horror actor in search of a realistic cloak for an upcoming role in a horror movie.  He does find what he's looking for, and much more.  Also in this one is Ingrid Pitt, as his buxom co-star.  This one had a twinge of humor throughout, while the others were more serious, straightforward horror tales.  One part that stands out in my mind was when Pertwee is verbally thrashing the art and movie director for the lack of realism in the sets and in the wardrobe, and he relates the 'look' he's after to past horror movies for examples, citing Frankenstein and Dracula, ""but the one with Bela Lugosi, not that newer one."" in reference to Christopher Lee and his performances as the count.

The fifth story is basically an ongoing one between the other stories, involving the Scotland Yard inspector hearing each of the four tales, and then deciding to see this house for himself.

All stories seem to be credited to Robert Bloch, probably best known for writing the Hitchcock classic Psycho, but looking at the IMDb, it shows a couple of other writers had a hand in this movie, most notably Richard Matheson.  The print used for transfer to DVD was quite good, especially when compared to an included trailer of dubious quality.  The only other special feature is a psuedo interview with the producer, Max Rosenberg, whose prolific production career includes such movies like Scream and Scream Again (1969), Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Land That Time Forgot (1975), and The Incredible Melting Man (1977).  Good directing, accomplished actors, a creepy house, and a haunting musical score all come together to create an overall enjoyable experience.  The threads that tied the individual stories to the house were a little thin in some places, but that appears fairly inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.",1067904000,44,3468,4.834179357021997
1904521,5,B0000A9GHP,"A creepy old house in the country proves to be deadly for anyone who rents it in this enjoyable quartet of horror tales.  From the British Amicus output of anthologies in the 60's-70's, ""House That Dripped Blood"" boasts a superb cast and an interesting set-up of a Scotland Yard investigator looking for a horror film star who disappeared after being the last to rent the house. A cop and the strange Real Estate rep who rents the house tells the investigator the stories of the people who met their doom while living there. The tales include a horror writer whose latest murderous creation seemingly comes to life, Peter Cushing discovers that a weird Museum of Horrors has a Salome exhibit that seems to be still collecting heads, Christopher Lee's angelic young daughter turns out to be a voodoo practicing witch, and in the final tongue-in-cheek (or is that TOOTH in cheek) tale, the horror film star buys a vampire's cloak that still has chilling powers. Jon Pertwee is wonderful as the actor and the bosomy Ingrid Pitt is his seductive co-star---a REAL vampire. Great supporting cast includes Nyree Dawn Porter (from BBC's ""The Forsyte Saga""). Very entertaining film that uses atmosphere and good acting instead of gore to get the job done. The DVD from Lion's Gate is a fine print in widescreen and features an interview with one of the producers, Max Rosenberg. This is another example of horror films that need to be on DVD. A great treat for Halloween and a collector's item for fans. Cut down the lights and enjoy.",1067385600,61,1525,4.776515151515151

1904583,4,B0000A9GHP,"Background: The horror anthology film subgenre appears to date to 1945 and the provocatively titled ""Dead Of Night"". More than a few hardcore horror fans still consider it the best of them all. It established several distinguishing marks which would become pretty much constants: a fairly long cast list, a quiet little out of the way spot where characters could relate the various creepy stories, and a supernatural skeptic or two who are slow to buy them.

Such productions would flow regularly for about fifteen years, starting with the Vincent Price vehicle ""Tales Of Terror"" in 1962, activity slowing after the late seventies. Interestingly, it was horror icon Price who declined the segment four part of B-movie actor Paul Henderson in our subject '71 film, due to previous contract commitments.

Plot: Sorry--plots plural, five of them counting snippy Scotland Yard inspector Holloway who comes to an unnamed backwater to investigate Henderson's disappearance. Henderson, turns out, is only the most recent of four unfortunate parties to have rented the same secluded mansion. Over the course of the 1:40 film, the house agent who rented the building to each briefs Holloway on its history. ONE, a horror story writer who seemingly got an overdose of atmosphere to stimulate his imagination. TWO, a newly retired stockbroker (Peter Cushing) who wandered into a wax museum of horrors in town nearby to find the spitting waxen image of a lost love. THREE, a widower (Christopher Lee) who hired a tutor for his timid eight year old daughter, with the tutor possibly learning more than any of them. And FOUR, Henderson (Jon Pertwee, an able stand-in for Price) who vanished with girlfriend/co-actor Carla. Holloway's so keen to get to the bottom of things that he insists on investigating out there alone late one night equipped with only a candleabra. Admirable work ethic, but a low percentage move in any self-respecting horror movie.

Assessment: Human actors are uniformly terrific in a strictly non-gory effort, although inside and out the house looks more dusty and old than creepy. Stories one and three are suitably chilling and terrifying respectively, the best of the four...or five. The second episode, featuring a couple of single older lonely guys who've never gotten over the same long-ago girl, is more pity-inducing than anything else. And after that gut-twisting third tale, management gracefully eases the tension in segment four; thank God. And of course, as a final touch, you're not unhappy to see Holloway go.",1425772800,,2535,5.1630170316301705
1904584,5,B0000A9GHP,"I first saw this movie when I was a eight years old. I walked 3 blocks uphill to the Bijou theater with my siblings, just to be scared out of my wits. I loved it then and still do over forty years later! Really well done movie from Amicus Studios (which I believe is an off shoot of Hammer Studios). Four very well composed ""short stories."" Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, gothic Hammer Studios feel...you can't go wrong!",1424822400,,421,4.48051948051948
1904585,5,B0000A9GHP,"Well the House That Dripped Blood is certainly better than the Dorm that Dripped Blood (not that there's any reason to compare the two other than the noticeably similar titles with one word exchanged for the other- oh and of course, never watch the Dorm That Dripped Blood please!  It's nothing like this!)  This is about an investigator who listens to and studies the mysterious nature of 4 different stories involving the death of 4 different owners who once lived in what appears to be a quiet house in the countryside.  This movie does a tremendous job in all categories of horror writing- the acting is based around top-notch British dialogue, the atmosphere/storytelling is balanced perfectly in that none of the 4 stories wander too long and become boring, nor do they ever feel undeveloped/insubstantial.  Each of the 4 stories flows just right and offers an appropriate amount of interest.

Anyway let me describe the stories.  The 1st one is about a man who moves into the home and writes murder stories.  After he and his wife settle into the house, it doesn't take long before the man starts ""hallucinating"" and believes he sees the fictional character he created in his story wandering around the house and intimidating/mentally torturing him.  His wife thinks he's crazy, but there *is* a good twist at the end that I can't spoil.  I simply have to stop explaining the story right now or I'll spoil it.  The 2nd story is about the second person who moves into this mysterious house.  He's an older loner guy who enjoys the simplicity of a quiet life alone going for walks, listening to his record player, taking care of his garden and occasionally venturing into town.  Well he eventually ventures into a wax mannequin museum that shows rather realistic looking people standing around, one of which bears a startling resemblance to a girl he once had a crush on.  An old acquaintance comes over and they discuss the girl and how she was out of both their leagues.

The 3rd story is my favorite.  It's about a strict father who forbids his young, adorable blonde-haired daughter from making friends, owning toys or going to the local playground.  After an attractive teacher moves in (and this part is hilarious to me- she just moves in and the father doesn't disapprove or turn her away despite how strict he is when it comes to his daughter) to help teach the little girl how to read and act like a normal kid, the father goes against anything the lady tries to do to help his daughter.  Eventually witchcraft elements come into the story which is really chilling.  The final person that moves into the house is probably the worst story of all.  This story is about an actor who doesn't like the scripts or the people he works with since they don't know how to make a classic horror film like in the older days, so he eventually goes into town and buys a Dracula's cloak for a movie he's acting in.  However this cloak happens to be the real deal so he actually turns into Dracula with fangs, flying abilities and neck-biting tendencies, lol.  It's the silliest story of all, but the woman he's working with and often visits is HOT don't you think?  Like if Ginger from Gilligan's Island was as attractive as she thinks she is, she'd look like THIS girl!

Overall this is a well-made horror.  The house is interesting in that it's not necessarily haunted, but it tends to draw people in who are destined for a deadly fate.  It reflects the personality of the people who live there I suppose (which is what is stated a couple times) but that only feels like part of the story.  No this house is just bad luck.  If you a bad outcome, well, move right in!  I like how the setting resembles the Resident Evil video game series (particularly part 2).  I really think the developers of Resident Evil were using this movie as an influence for the character of Chief Irons since the setting and Chief Iron's dialogue resemble some of the characters in this movie.  Anyway GREAT movie!",1423699200,,3991,4.643874643874644

1904587,4,B0000A9GHP,"This is one of a number of fun horror anthologies that Amicus produced in the 60s/70s. This one revolves around a fairly isolated creepy old house and the misfortune that befalls it's tenants.

The first story features a horror writer and his wife who have rented the house so that he can write his new novel.  Unfortunately, he begins to catch glimpses of the strangler he created for the book in and around his house.  Has his creation come to life, or is he descending into madness?  This is a good story with a nice twist but is weakened by one actor's poor acting, IMO.

Next up, we have a story featuring Peter Cushing.  He visits the wax museum in the neighboring town and inside he spies a waxworks that  looks very similar to a former love. He, and a friend of his, soon become obsessed by that waxwork.  This is a nice piece, but feels like the back  story could have been filled out some.

Third, and perhaps the strongest story of the collection, stars Christopher Lee as an overprotective father who brought his daughter live with him in the house.  He engages a nanny/tutor for his daughter, as he will be busy with his work.  It's clear from early on that there is something wrong with this family, and although midway through the story one can guess where it is headed, it still plays out beautifully.

Finally, we have the last story, in which Jon Pertwee (the Third Doctor of Doctor Who) is a horror movie star who has rented the house in order to be close to the studio where he is filming his latest horror movie.  Upset by the low quality of the sets and costumes due to budget constraints, he buys a cloak to wear as part of his costume - unfortunately, he has bought more than he reckons.  This is the most comedic of the stories, and probably not the best one to end on.

The wrap around story for the anthology features a policeman who is investigating the disappearances of the latest tenant, and what he finds.

Overall, it's a fan little horror anthology if you're looking for a little fun, nothing too deep or gory.

one of many classic atmospheric thrillers from Amicus films during the 70's, 1971 to be exact is when this film was made
not much Horror as in blood & Gore effects which does not surprise me
but tons of atmospheric suspense with lots of Great acting performances that's for sure
This particular Amicus film is like an anthology of 4 creepy chilling stories all written by Author Robert Bloch
and guess who Robert Bloch is the Author of the classic suspense thriller PSYCHO
.some of the 4 stories are very well acted, it's matter of opinion really
the organ music score helps the plot along makes it creepy and chilling
but overall i still enjoy watching this film now a days, Ingrid pitt looks Hot in the cloak when she was in her prime.

this new U.S. dvd re-issue by Henstooth is terrible, no extras no nothing it is waste of money
any fan of this film needs to buy the Anchor bay U.K. DVD
lots of special features on the Anchor bay U.K. release
there's a new making of featurette 30mins
 with new interviews of Director Peter Duffel, Ingrid pitt, Chloe franks & Geoffrey Bayldon
who give their recollections on making the film,
Director Peter Duffel & Film Historian Johnathon rigby also give a new Audio commentary for the film
interesting commentary Johnathon rigby asks Peter lots of questions about the film & Amicus producer Milton subotsky
this Anchor bay release is Digital remastered widescreen format 16x9 not sure of the ratio it doesn't say on the back cover
i assume it's 1:85:1 but that's a Guess, the film is in widescreen nethertheless between 1:78:1-1:85:1
a new 5.1 Digital surround sound mix has been given, so much better than the old Mono mix
so don't by the Henstooth DVD i think it's an insult that Henstooth even bothered to release this film again on dvd
buy the Anchor bay U.K. DVD by the way the dvd is region 2 locked so you need ALL REGIONS player of course
it's still available to buy from amazon uk or buy it off ebay uk

1904592,2,B0000A9GHP,"Sadly, I must join those who have given this film a low review.  THTDB has a great cast of 1970s horror stalwarts including Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee (although not sharing any scenes),  a Robert Bloch script, stories with clever plots, yet the end product simply is dull.  Taste and restraint have their place, but this film has no zest, no zing.  Those who, for instance, enjoy Bela Lugosi's 1931 Dracula usually find Dracula's off-screen staking a huge let down.  Horror requires some explicitness,  as Hammer knew and as Amicus often forgot.  The weakness of THTDB is not simply a matter of low budgets, it is a lack of artistic fortitude.  Resisting excessiveness often is right -- combining suspense plus horror is entertaining -- but horror must been seen, not simply, as with suspense, imagined.",1417219200,,810,4.948148148148148

1904594,5,B0000A9GHP,"When I think of 1970s horror, this movie always comes to mind. Not only does it have two legends in horror acting in the same movie, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, it also stars Ingrid Pitt. Ingrid would also go on to star in ""The Countess Dracula"" and ""The Vampire Lovers"". Those are currently on Blu-ray and are fantastic if you are an Ingrid Pitt fan.
 She stars in the last tale, the one with the aging actor portraying Dracula. He is dismayed at the current state of horror movies and wants realism at all costs. He seeks out an antique or novelty shop for a real looking cloak. He gets what he comes for, but soon realizes that the cloak makes whoever wears it, a real vampire complete with sharp teeth and the ability to levitate above the ground. He doesn't believe what he has found until a real vampire, (played by Ingrid Pitt), who has been following him in his career, reveals herself to him one evening. She loves his movies so much, that the ""vampires"" of which she is a part of, want him to become one of them forever.

This is only one of the 4 stories, and if you are a fan of early horror movies starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, I think you will enjoy this movie. I must say there is no blood, guts and splatter in your face every 5 minutes. The movie relies on the atmosphere of the house in which all of the main characters live in one after another. I found it quite good, but I am also a big fan of the three main actors that are in it. I believe that this movie predates that of ""Tales From the Crypt"" and ""Vault of Horror"".

Lionsgate has done a nice job on this DVD edition, if you can get it. The one pictured is the Henstooth edition.
The menu is nicely done with movie footage and music in background.

1904625,5,B0000A9GHP,"The fans of Amicus movies all have their personal favorites. Some prefer the pulpiness of TALES FROM THE CRYPT or VAULT OF HORROR while others enjoy the cheesiness of TORTURE GARDEN or DR TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS. Then there's the literate approach of HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD and FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. I love them all and saw every Amicus film that came my way, even the non-anthology ones like AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS and I, MONSTER. Most of them I caught in drive-ins. My personal preference is for the low key approach of HOUSE and GRAVE with HOUSE being my favorite Amicus movie although it was a close race between the two.

HOUSE strikes me as a combination of MASTERPIECE THEATER and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS. It's even based on stories by Robert Bloch (PSYCHO). The film is a remarkably handsome production considering the budgetary limitations of $500,000. It grossed far more than that. The photography is simple and direct, the background lighting is extremely effective, and the performances by old pros at the genre like Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are uniformly fine. Even an over-the-top Jon Pertwee in a role originally intended for Vincent Price is, forgive the pun, Price-less. As is often the case with anthologies, some stories are better than others with #s 2 & 3 standing out in my opinion.

The film has an interesting background and release history. In addition to the Vincent Price story, the director, Peter Duffell, wanted to call it ""Death & the Maiden"" after the musical work in the Peter Cushing segment but producer Milton Subotsky came up with the less prosaic title. Ironically, there's no blood in the film at all. It was originally released in the U.S by a small company called Cinerama (no relation to the film process) who quickly went under leaving the film hard to see for many years. The original VHS was a sad affair but the 2003 Lionsgate DVD (the one pictured here) is the one to get. The more recent Hens Tooth DVD has oversaturated colors.

1904630,2,B0000A9GHP,"The House That Dripped Blood is one of the better Amicus omnibus horror films, with no clinker stories and each segment arguably better than the last. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, while sharing no screen time, are excellent in their respective segments (as is all the cast). Though the connecting story is a little weak, the movie as a whole is ultimately quite satisfying.

Having already bought the 2003 LionsGate DVD release, which included a nice Max J. Rosenberg interview/featurette, I had been waiting to hear whether the recent Hen's Tooth reissue was a significant improvement on the LionsGate edition, thus warranting a double dip. Then I saw a great price on it and my patience got the better of me, and I grabbed it anyway. Now I am wishing I had waited longer!

In short, the Hen's Tooth remaster, or ""reimagining,"" or whatever they call it, looks like someone did a William Friedkin on it and jacked up the color saturation and vibrance so that fleshtones and foliage are hot pink and electric lime green, respectively. All the way through, the color rendition is just painful to behold. (For example, in the shot before Peter Cushing enters the waxworks, he looks like he's been dusted with pink talcum powder and his lips are fuchsia.) There was nothing wrong with the color in the previous release; it is accurately balanced, with natural fleshtones, and well saturated without blooming or becoming overbearing. The Hen's tooth transfer looks like some inexperienced video engineer's idea of the MTV ""extreme"" edition, with obnoxiously oversaturated and unnaturally vivid colors and a vaguely ""overprocessed"" look. I far, far prefer the more naturalistic palette of the LionsGate transfer.

It's not like the LionsGate transfer really needed any tweaking: black level, color fidelity, and contrast are excellent, and sharpness and detail are superior to the Hen's Tooth transfer, to my eyes, on a 60-inch screen. To be fair, the LionsGate transfer shows some light, sporadic speckling not present on the Hen's Tooth disc. I directly compared both discs with my DVD player and Blu-ray player, then swapped the discs and repeated the comparison, and in both configurations the LionsGate edition looked noticeably superior in overall picture quality, and color rendition in particular. And it's 16x9 anamorphic widescreen, so no problem there.

My advice is, scoop up a copy of the LionsGate release before it's impossible to find, getting the Rosenberg featurette in the deal, and forget that this Hen's Tooth edition even exists. The LionsGate print is worth the few extra bucks, believe me. If you already have the LionsGate DVD, wait for the (hopefully) inevitable Blu-ray, and don't bother with this release at all. I'll be selling my copy or giving it to a friend. Big disappointment.",1367712000,10,2810,5.102173913043479

Amicus returns with another of their signature omnibus pictures featuring an all-too-familiar cast and four short stories written by Psycho scribe Robert Bloch. In the first, a Horror writer is driven mad when one of his creations escapes from his imagination... to kill! Peter Cushing stars as the next unfortunate tenant, who finds a statue with an incredible likeness to his past love in the local Museum of Horrors, but he'll lose his head when he finds out just how she got there! When a domineering father moves in with his daughter, the tutor he hires fears that the girl has been a victim of his abuse, until she finds the girl's collection of voodoo dolls! Finally, an eccentric film star attempts to get into character using a mysterious old cape, which he believes transforms him into a vampire by night. Jon Pertwee is wildly entertaining as the jaded film star, but despite its glamorous casting, the young Chloe Franks upstages everyone as the underage sorceress in ""Sweets to the Sweet."" Her innocent naivete transforms into a devilish grin as she performs her wicked acts against her father. As is usually the case in these types of films, the stories in THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD are a bit uneven, with the first and second falling far behind the remaining two, but they are all enjoyable nonetheless and feature each of the actors and actresses in fine form.

1904643,5,B0000A9GHP,The House That Dripped Blood held my interest from beginning to end.  Anyone that likes Hammer Films will like Amicus Productions.,1357689600,,130,5.190476190476191
1904644,3,B0000A9GHP,"This isn't a horror movie so much as an anthology, not unlike Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath."" Here you have four short stories centered on the house of the title.

There were quite a few of these made around that time and, like the others, the results here are hit and miss. The first piece, starring Denholm Elliott, is quite good. He plays a writer who rents said house as a retreat to do some writing. One of his murderous characters comes to life (or so he thinks) and makes a mess of things. Elliott does a nice job. The script has a couple of surprises and it's a nifty premise.

The second installment Stars Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland. They do what they can with the tepid script. Cushing rents the house as a retirement place. He visits the local House of Wax where he see the likeness of a woman he must have had a strong attachment to. Ackland visits him. He also sees the likeness. This woman was obviously the cause of a rift between them once upon a time. The image haunts both of them and leads to some nastiness. There just didn't seem to be enough there for a story and I didn't believe it. These are grown, intelligent men and I don't see them going off like that. And what of the young guy who walks in in the last scene? What's his connection to all this? We get no background on him so it pretty much negates all that came before.

The third installment is pretty cool/creepy with Christopher Lee as a widowed father of a young girl. He hires a nanny/ tutor so he can keep said daughter away from the general population. As it turns out, it's for a good reason. The daughter does a good job. Her transformation is creepy. The performances are good and the story unfolds nicely.

The fourth piece, involving vampires, is a nice turn on the legend. Jon Pertwee plays the lead who is an actor on the set of what is yet another horror movie in a long career of horror movies. He wants authenticity as a vampire so he looks to purchase a cloak that will look better than the one provided by the studio. He finds one but does not realize all that comes with the purchase. Pertwee has a good face and he uses it well here. The story is nifty but the end is a bit cheezy.

All in all this is a fun time. It harkens back to the days when horror was more classic and less gory. It has a good cast and a decent look. I don't know if any of this was shot in a real house or if everything was done on sets but it is a bit claustrophobic. The set designs are nice. Just a bit tight. It's directed well enough and the musical score is OK considering the time. This might be too lame for someone who was born later and raised on the new breed of horror. But for those of us baby boomers this is worth a look.",1314662400,3,2714,4.161904761904762
1904645,3,B0000A9GHP,"Amicus Productions was an English company that trod in the steps of Hammer Studios, producting low-budget horror films.  Over time, Hammer Studios horror films became increasingly sophisticated; Amicus, however, remained distinctly low-rent.  Although Amicus did a number of prehistoric rubber monster movies (the best known are THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT and AT THE EARTH'S CORE), it was best known for its series of ""ominbus"" or ""portmanteau"" films--movies in which several stories were linked by some sort of framing story.  Such films included DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS, TORTURE GARDEN, ASYLUM, and THE VAULT OF HORROR.  Among the studio's more popular films in this line was 1970's THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, which was based on four stories by Robert Bloch, author of the novel PSYCHO.

The framing device is simple: a famous film star has gone missing and a Scotland Yard detective has been dispatched to investigate.  He is warned by the local authorities that the film star's disappearance may have something to do with the country house that the actor rented.  Indeed, the house has such an unsavory history that the local authorities actually have a file on it and the strange occurrances and odd rumors that have surrounded it.

The first segment is commonly known as ""Method of Murder,"" and concerns novelist Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham), who lease the house as a quiet but atmospheric place where Charles--who specializes in horror novels featuring very nasty murders--can finish his latest book.  Charles finds inspiration and creates a strangler named Dominic, but he becomes so involved in his story that he actually begins to see Dominic.  Alice urges Charles to see a psychiatrist, but the sessions do not play out in a way that any one concerned expects.  Of the four stories, this is easily the most unsettling, highly atmospheric and just plain out creepy.

The remaining segments are less impressive.  In ""Waxworks,"" two old friends (Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland) who once vied for the love the same woman discover a local wax museum in which a sculpture of Salome seems recreate her likeness.  ""Sweets To The Sweet"" finds a widower (Christopher Lee) who prevents his young daughter (Chloe Franks) from having dolls--for reasons the girl's teacher (Nyree Dawn Porter) is slow to discover.  And then there is the story of the missing actor, ""The Cloak,"" in which a tempermental actor (Jon Pertwee) playing a vampire undertakes to find his own costume, only to find that the cloak he has purchased has a rather unfortunate power well known to his film co-star (Ingrid Pitt.)  Needless to say, the Scotland Yard detective doesn't believe any of it, demands the keys to the house, makes a night-time visit, and meets an unfortunate end due to his own stubborness.

Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD will remind American viewers of a certain age of the television series NIGHT GALLERY--and not just because it offers unrelated stories, but because the stories themselves are so uneven.  Even so, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is mildly amusing, and most fans of British horror of the 1960s and 1970s will enjoy it.  The picture and sound are good and the DVD includes a short bonus on Amicus producer Max Rosenburg--although the sound on the bonus, unlike the sound on the film, is a bit ify.  Recommended for fans of the genre.

1904646,4,B0000A9GHP,"** MINOR SPOILERS BUT THEY DON'T RUIN THE FILM TO READ THEM! **

I really enjoyed the House that Dripped Blood (even though not a drop is seen in the actual film)!  This British horror film had some big name horror stars such as Ingrid Pitt, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing so I had to watch it.

Made well before Tales from the Crypt, it follows the anthology style of that late lamented TV series.  A film star goes missing and the landlord of the house (Stoker, naturally) tells the Scotland Yard inspector who is investigating the disappearance a history of the house, thus a great lead-in to four stories surrounding the house.

I won't regurgitate the plot, but instead give my brief impressions of each episode.

""Method For Murder""  was an interesting story of a mystery writer who comes to let the house to get some mood and it seems his main character, a strangler named Dominic, is appearing in real life to a point where he is going nuts!  Robert Bloch brings horror in the form of Dominic as well as an underlying psychological terror due to his scheming wife.

""Waxworks""  was a lot of fun with Peter Cushing and his friend being fascinated with a wax woman in a wax museum.  How were they to know the proprietor is an axe murderer?  The strange colors and warped view are weird and psychedelic. I have to hand it to the director.  He clearly must have some admiration for Hitchcock and the German silent era.

""Sweets to the Sweet""  is Christopher Lee's vehicle, who actually plays the victim for a change.  His daughter seems sweet and nice, except when she plays with voodoo dolls and sticks pins in them!  Robert Bloch uses sound and incredible visuals to give the audience a hint of what's going on rather than a blatant show (screams, melting doll, joyful evil smiles).  Nicely produced.  It's also a satire on Hammer horror films.

Lastly in ""The Cloak""  we have our missing film star who it turns out is a horror actor who brings along his girl played by Ingrid Pitt.  The cloak in question is addictive and soon we have vampires running around loose in the house.  (How they locked themselves in the basement though is a mystery.)  It's great watching traditional vampires for a change, with fangs that are reminiscent of Count Orlok of Nosferatu fame.

Fed up with the landlord's stories of the house, the Scotland Yard inspector has had enough and goes to the house at night and runs into a pair of vampires.  I'm afraid Ingrid gets her dinner early that night!

Also on this DVD is a great interview with the producer Max Rosenberg who has produced such films as 1957's Curse of Frankenstein and 1972's Tales from the Crypt!",1276732800,,2652,4.587234042553192

I discovered, far beyond my expectations, that ""House"" has great writing, direction and acting.  In an unexpected turn, I found myself immersed in the movie's devotion to, and exploration of, adult issues and psychological terror with dashes of sly humor thrown in along the way.

On the surface, the old Hammer and Amicus films might appear too quaint for modern audiences accustomed to excessive blood and gore.  However, I've played ""House"" and the other horror anthologies for friends and family on movie nights at our homes and everyone enjoys them.  Great fun!",1266019200,3,814,5.128787878787879
1904648,4,B0000A9GHP,"I've been on a horror binge lately, and watched this Amicus gem for the first time tonight. ""The House that Dripped Blood"" is a horror anthology that reminded me of another Amicus production, ""From Beyond the Grave"", which was also an anthology. ""The House that Dripped Blood"" boasts an excellent cast, which helps move the stories along.

A Scotland Yard inspector investigates the mysterious disappearance of a well-known horror movie actor [Jon Pertwee]. His last known address was a sinister manor in the English countryside. A constable tells the inspector that it is the house which is the problem, bringing misfortune to all who reside in it. In the first story, a horror writer with writer's block moves into the house with his lovely wife, and immediately his creative juices start flowing, creating a homicidal character which becomes all too real as the days pass by. In the second story, Peter Cushing plays a retired stockbroker, who is pining for a lost, dead love, only to discover to his horror that a life-like wax figure in the local waxworks bears an uncanny resemblance to her. When an old friend comes to visit, both men find themselves drawn to the wax figure, with predictably disastrous consequences. In the third story, Christopher Lee moves into the house with his beautiful young daughter, who turns out to have a fascination with the dark arts. At this point, the inspector has had enough, and goes to the real estate agent to get the keys to the house, only to be regaled with the last story, that of the movie actor who comes into possession of a sinister cape which makes him embrace the role of a vampire all too realistically. When the tales end, the inspector decides to visit the house himself, ignoring the dire warnings of the realtor.

I liked this anthology, though I think I preferred ""From Beyond the Grave"", but both are wonderful horror anthologies that will satisfy the cravings of classic horror fans, especially fans of Cushing and Lee. Recommended!",1253059200,3,1995,4.864705882352941
1904649,4,B0000A9GHP,"I first saw the House that Dripped Blood in 1971 and enjoyed it to the tune of fours stars.  Movies made by Amicus are usually set in current times and should not be confused with Hammer. Amicus films often involve a collection of horror stories with something to tie them together. This nice little package has Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, although not in the same tale.

I saw this film in the year it was made in the Bronx one Sunday night up at Fordham Road with my cousins and we all enjoyed it.  The common element to the three (or four, if you count the last short tale) was this neat old house which would be leased out to new individuals, and then the supernatural fun would first start.",1249862400,3,702,4.343511450381679
1904650,4,B0000A9GHP,"On the outside, Yew Tree House seems like a peaceful, country villa - the perfect place for escaping your worries.  Unfortunately, it is possessed by evil.  Books on witchcraft line the shelves in the study.  Yew trees used to make magic potions provide shade.  This house destroys the lives of everyone who lives there as evidenced by the quartet of tales in one of Amicus Production's greatest horror anthologies:  ""The House That Dripped Blood.""

""Method for Murder"" - An overworked horror writer, Charles Hillyer, is obsessed by his latest novel.  He begins to imagine seeing its villain, Dominick the strangler.  Then people around him begin to die.  The creepiest tale in the anthology, it has a great twist ending.

""Waxworks"" - Horror legend Peter Cushing is retired stockbroker Phillip Grayson.  Wandering into town, he visits a wax museum of murderers.  One of the, Salome, resembles his dead lover; she is holding the head of John the Baptist on a platter.  Because the wax figure is so beautiful and mesmerizing, men begin literally losing their heads.  This one is the goriest tale.

""Sweets to the Sweet"" - Another horror legend, this time Christopher Lee, stars in this tale; he is businessman John Reid who is terrified of his adorable, pixie-faced daughter, and for good reason.  She is the spawn of a witch.  Voodoo and black magic run rampant in this tale.

""The Cloak"" - Famous horror actor Paul Henderson buys a cloak for a role in a vampire film; he is unaware that it belonged to a genuine vampire.  The cloak causes him to put the bite on luscious Ingrid Pitt (""The Vampire Lovers"" and ""Countess Dracula"").

  Lions Gate has presented a superb DVD package.  ""The House That Dripped Blood"" is presented in a pristine widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Audio and video are wonderful.  An interview with the witty co-producer Max J. Rosenberg has been provided.  Max explained that him and his co-producer Milton Subotsky called their production company Amicus which means ""friends.""  ""What were we suppose to call it?"" he asked, ""enemies?""  All of the tales are based on short stores written by ""Psycho"" author Robert Bloch.  Max explains that he went through literally hundreds of them before he found ones suitable for the anthology.

  ""The House of Blood"" is highly recommended for Amicus fans.  Other Amicus anthologies that are highly recommended are ""Asylum,"" ""Torture Garden,"" ""Tales from the Crypt,"" ""Vault of Horror,"" ""From Beyond the Grave,"" ""Tales that Witness Madness"" and ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.""

In fact, this film might be the horror equivalent of the proverbial ""Little Girl With a Little Curl:""  When it's good, it's very, very good, but when it's bad, it's horrid...or at least uninspired.  On the good side is the entire wraparound set up, that of a police inspector investigating the disappearance of an actor in the house, and then learning of its checkered history.  On the bad side, I've watched this film repeatedly and I STILL can't made any sense of the final revelation of WHY the house is doing these things.  Also on the good side is a dynamite opening episode featuring Denholm Elliot as ""young"" writer from London (he still manages to pull the role off despite being in his fifties) whose horror novels appear to be coming to life, and a middle chapter with Christopher Lee as the remote father of a very strange little girl, at odds with a sympathetic new nanny.  Though it's brief, this is one of Lee's best performances, exploiting his talent for playing fearful men, which he does as well as playing fearsome ones.  Probably the worst element, unfortunately, is the one starring Peter Cushing, in which he plays a man who becomes obsessed with a figure in a wax museum.  Cushing was a master at rising above material, but here he gets bogged down with wobbly character motivation and a subtext that keeps trying to emerge but never does.  The conclusion is pretty predictable (particularly if you've seen the poster art, which is reproduced on the DVD cover), but still confusing.  The last segment, starring Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror film star known for playing vampires who gets more than his contract called for, is the best known one, but not the best.  It is played for camp comedy and is quite amusing, but at the expense of the story.  One of its best bits is a cameo by undersung British actor Geoffrey Bayldon, made up to resemble Ernest Thesiger in ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" as a strange antique shop owner.  Devotees of vampire lore will find any number of no-nos in this sequence (not to mention highly visible flying wires).  Nearly all of the Amicus portmanteaus are mixed bags, but this one seems to be more mixed than most.  Wouldn't it be spectacular if somebody could assemble the ""Severed Hand"" segment from ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors,"" ""Living Doll"" from ""Torture Garden,"" the Denholm Elliot segment here, the Richard Todd/Barbara Parkins opener from ""Asylum,"" the Peter Cushing ""Valentine's Day"" chapter of ""Tales From the Crypt"" and the Terry-Thomas/Glynnis Johns segment from ""Vault of Horror"" into one super-portmanteau?",1184457600,3,2791,4.834033613445378

Bram Stoker?) he learns that the house Henderson was living in has a dark history behind it, and that some people died tragically.  The inspector of course doesn't believe in superstitious nonsense.

Story one concerns a writer specializing in gruesome horror.  Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife stay in the house, he mainly to write his new novel.

His imagination, or is it real?  This is probably the best episode here, given the right amount of suspense

""Waxworks"" involves a retired stockbroker, Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who plans to just relax, such as reading and listening to music.  However, a trip to the local wax museum stirs something in him.  The statue of Salome reminds him of a beautiful woman whose photograph he has kept.  He gets an unexpected visit from his friend Neville (Joss Ackland), who happened to be passing by.  He also goes to the waxworks, and like Philip, recognizes the same woman.

Christopher Lee appears in ""Sweets To The Sweet,"" the story most like a Tales From The Crypt episode.  He plays John Reid, a somewhat cold widower who with his timid daughter Jane move into the house.  He hires a Ms. Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to be a private tutor for Jane.  She turns out to be nice and tries to bring some sunshine into Jane's life.  However, he refuses to allow Jane to play with other children or to have any toys at all.  And he's apparently glad that his wife is now departed, but why is he so cruel to his own daughter?  The most gruesome death of all (offscreen) happens here.

When Jon Pertwee starred in ""The Cloak,"" he had just become famous as the Third Doctor Who, and was inbetween his first and second seasons.  Here, he plays the object of the inspector's search, the vain and arrogant horror actor Paul Henderson, who buys a genuine cloak from an antique store.  When he puts the cloak on, strange things happen to him, like his growing fangs.  Opposite him is his fellow performer and friend Carla, played by the sensuous Ingrid Pitt, who would gain fame as Carmilla and Elisabeth Bathory in other horror films.  In his memoirs, Pertwee said he based his character on Christopher Lee, but couldn't tell Lee, his friend, when the latter asked him who his inspiration for the character was.  In one scene, Pitt was supposed to slap Pertwee, who asked her use the hand without her sharp rings on it.  When the scene came on, she forgot.  Ouch!

The last segment is particularly interesting, as the production team tried to send it up.  Pertwee recalls how much of the comedy and consequently his scenes were edited out when the producer saw what was happening and got mad, but seeing that the picture was already halfway done, couldn't reshoot scenes due to budget constraints so practically all the comedy ended up on the cutting room floor to retain the seriousness of the film.

A not bad, all-star British cast in this horror anthology outing.  A different style from Mario Bava's Black Sabbath to be sure, but I bet Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were relieved not to be playing Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing for once.",1091232000,,3740,4.735294117647059

7996532,3,B0000A9GHP,"The House That Dripped Blood: An Amicus anthology consisting of four scary stories from Robert Bloch wrapped around a police and well a realtor investigation into the titular house.

Episode one ""Method For Murder. A horror writers creation comes to life and attacks him during a bout of writer's block.  I may be mistaken but I am pretty sure that the House That Dripped Blood appears in the Stephen King non-fiction horror treatise Danse Macabre under the chapter Where I Get all My Ideas.  This is a decent entry marred only by the old fifties chestnut of the dull Freudian psychiatrist and a really bad make-up job on Tom Adams looking like a silent movie antagonist.

Episode two: ""Waxworks"" A gay stockbroker Peter Cushing retired from the city rents the titular house to enjoy some gardening and classical music. An old friend Joss Ackland stops by unexpectedly and a tension from their shared past rises up consuming them both.

 I understand that this is a horror anthology made on the cheap but the character development in this episode is simply non-existent. Apparently, we are lead to believe that both men are obsessed with the same woman from many years ago. Since they refuse to talk about it themselves we are meant to fill in the blanks. When a local waxworks in town has a wax statue of the same woman both men become obsessed unable to leave town.

The episode simply fails to give enough information for us to care for the fates of our two leads. Add in lighting from the Batman TV Series, hammy acting from the Waxworks proprietor, very poor props and an ever increasingly ridiculous display of ascots on both our lead characters and any tension is out the window.

Episode three: Sweets to the Sweet Probably the most solid of the four outings it has great acting from Christopher Lee and Chloe Franks as his daughter. A straightforward telling of a man who has a special child and a nanny/teacher to look after her. A little slow and certainly an often told tale but competently done.

Episode Four: The Cloak Of the four episodes The cloak tells the most interesting of tales. A hammy horror actor (Dr. Whos own Jon Pertwee) buys a vampire cloak that turns him into a real vampire while worn. This episode is played for laughs with the always enjoyable Ingrid Pitt matching the hammy acting with her loose knowledge of English and her tight cleavage. Completely out of tone with the rest of the film it actually deserves its own feature.

The Wraparound: An While it is only there to tie the four stories together it simply doesnt do the job. If this was outtakes of a short called How to Rent Real Estate featured at the beginning of an MST3K Episode I would not have really been surprised. It really drains the fun out of a film that needed no help.

In Conclusion: At no point does the house actually drip blood. In fact, at no point does anything or anyone drip blood. This is clearly a film meant for the wee ones. A good ""your first horror film"" for the grade school crowd. For one thing, kids might actually be surprised by the twists in the stories. For adults, however, the slow pace, predictable stories and the lack of wardrobe malfunction on Miss Pitt make this a pleasant time waster down memory lane but also an easy pass.",1521936000,,3261,4.605172413793103

7996539,4,B0000A9GHP,I thoroughly enjoy the old style horror films. This one is pretty consistent for that error and well executed.  If you like these 60's and 70's style films you will like this one as well.  The movie comprises several short stories centered around a house and it's revolving occupants.  Christopher Lee stars in one of the stories and the last one involves ingrid pitt who's easy on the eyes and a welcome cast member.,1472428800,,417,4.608108108108108
