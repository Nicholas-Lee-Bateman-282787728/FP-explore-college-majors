2635049,4,B000HEVZA8,Considering the destructive images that all young women see in the media and that they attempt to mimic these images without realizing the consequences that this has on their bodies and minds all mothers should show their daughters this film.  It is touching and heartbreaking.  As someone who struggled through anorexia in my teen years I found that this film rang especially true to the feelings that I had then as well as the body image that I have today.  What most people don't realize is that eating disorders are slippery slopes and those that have them don't usually realize that they have a problem until it is too late.  Share this film with your daughters and absorb it for yourself as well.,1165276800,2,702,4.682926829268292
2635050,4,B000HEVZA8,"I thought it was excellent and as someone who has been in these people's shoes I have to say it was a very good representation. It was shown just as it really is. However as a recovering [...]/bulimic I had to process afterwards. It is TRIGGERING and it caused me to relive emotions but it also helped to remind me I don't want to feel that way again.
I think it would be helpful for friends/family, probably not for somebody who is struggling.
Overall very good!",1164758400,7,463,4.395348837209302
2635051,5,B000HEVZA8,"this documentary was an amazing portrayal of women and eating disorders.  but as a person who was a patient at renfrew, i have to say this could definitely be a trigger to women in recovery.  it was amazingly done and gave a very raw feeling of what it really is like to be plagued with this disease, but it will probably be very difficult for recovering bulimics/anorexics to watch.  highly recommended though!!!",1163635200,9,413,4.708333333333333
2635052,5,B000HEVZA8,"I just saw the documentary on HBO and it was very touching.  It gave actual insight into the lives of people dealing with eating disorders and how hard it is to kick the habit of trying to be thin.  It's powerful and very well done and recommend this to anyone, especially fans of previous HBO documentaries.",1163462400,9,308,4.482142857142857
2635073,4,B000HEVZA8,"Good.  Real.  Very good filming and editing. Just wish they also showed people who recovered, along with those who continued to struggle.  I know it wouldn't have made as much of an impact as a documentary, but should also give hope to those out there struggling with this disorder.  There are some who benefit from treatment and recover successfully.",1516838400,,351,4.898305084745763
2635074,3,B000HEVZA8,"Thin is a disturbing look into the complete and utter failure of treatment approaches to eating disorders in this country. If Renfrew is considered one of the top treatment centers of eating disorders, it is not wonder that so many women are suffering and ultimately dying from these disorders. Effective eating disorder treatment entails a comprehensive, individualized approach to both psychological and physical treatment of a patient. It involves addressing and solving the roots of the problem, and training the patient to build a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. In Renfrew's view, 'treatment' involves clueless staff, many overweight themselves, forcing patients to consume lots of GARBAGE food like cupcakes. As well as infantilizing grown women and punishing them for things such as getting a tattoo, and hiding a piece of food in their room. None of these things do ANYTHING to help the patient. A much more effective approach would be having competent, knowledgeable counselors on staff to work with these women to systematically address and work through the root causes of their disorders. Then - and this is secondary, because eating disorders are primarily a psychological NOT a physical disorder - teach these women to develop a healthy relationship with food. This could be done in a way such as preparing HEALTHY, wholesome meals together, from fresh food. Not force-feeding women disgusting, chemical and sugar-laden 'food' that does nothing beneficial for the body. Renfrew is one of many examples of a failed health care system in the U.S., and I sincerely hope they work on changing their approach, especially in light of the tragic and completely preventable death of one of the patients portrayed, Polly.",1515888000,3,1726,5.302919708029197
2635075,4,B000HEVZA8,"Great insight into the world of eating disorders.  Anorexia Nervosa, in particular, is no joke!  The women interviewed for this documentary were very brave to do so and this one is particularly sad since one of them dies after we get to know her.  I'd recommend anyone watch this, regardless of your exposure to this topic but especially for teens and young women who suffer from this mental illness.  It is one result of a society that glorifies being thin above all else.  We spend so much time and money on those with addiction illnesses (not that that's bad), and should also be paying a lot more attention to this one!",1515456000,,623,4.576576576576577
2635076,4,B000HEVZA8,"I feel so sorry for Polly who was victimized by her mother. Just unbelievable, wouldve been prevented if mental health was supported by the government as one of the most serious diseases afflicting a large part of the population.",1512345600,,229,4.897435897435898
2635077,4,B000HEVZA8,"This is such a sad documentary.  It would have been nice if they had followed someone that ended up being successful in recovery.  Eating disorders are some of the most difficult disorders to gain recovery.  Society still does not respect these disorders as true diseases, in general.  There needed to be some education to this film.  It was very brave of these women to allow the cameras to invade their privacy.  I would have rated this 5 stars, if it had been a bit more educational regarding eating disorders.",1504396800,,513,4.707865168539326
2635078,5,B000HEVZA8,"As someone going into the mental health field, this documentary peeked my interest as I wanted to know more about the intricate details of what it is to have an eating disorder. This documentary was heartbreaking and true in its observations of what these women's reality was. I found myself rooting for their recovery in the face of overwhelming odds and looking them up to see if there was any news on them now. I would recommend this to anyone going into mental health counseling as it gives a true look into the lives of those with eating disorders, not just a DSM-5 diagnosis.",1503187200,2,581,4.596153846153846
2635079,4,B000HEVZA8,"I cried watching this last night, as it brought back many memories from my own in-patient treatment for anorexia at Remuda Ranch, the nation's only Christian eating disorder facility in Arizona. While the staff may have appeared uncaring, it's important to remember they have an intimate understanding of eating disorders, advanced degrees with very specialized training in anorexia/bulimia, and the knowledge of how to beat these insidious diseases. While I can't speak for Renfrew (among the best ED hospitals in the nation), the staff at Remuda are extremely well trained and TOUGH. You have to remember, this is REHAB - not a walk in the park. It BITES while you're there and it's terribly difficult, but you are surrounded by love and support and they get results. I believe Remuda's Christian foundation is essential to healing from an eating disorder. Patients start every morning with chapel - a mini sermon and the singing of hymns. Through God's grace, I believe that I'm alive and well today - 18 years post-discharge - because of Remuda Ranch.",1502064000,4,1055,5.034285714285715
2635080,4,B000HEVZA8,"It has a really good message, that eating disorders are dangerous. However, I think that the ending conclusions show that only seldom people die from it, which isn't true. It could have included more of a range of people that were successful in treatment but also more on the harsh reality.",1501804800,,290,4.705882352941177
2635081,5,B000HEVZA8,This should be required viewing. The honesty and truth of this film helps anyone living with or caring for someone with an eating disorder understand the issues both sides face.,1500422400,,177,4.933333333333334
2635082,3,B000HEVZA8,"Not so much a reflection of how well made this film was - it was a story (stories) decently told. However, I was shocked that this treatment program ultimately perpetuated an unhealthy relationship with food. The meals were horrible!. White bread, white sugar, fat. The food was sad! These women should be introduced to beautiful, fresh, TASTY and HEALTHY foods! Outrageous that one of the women was forced to eat a spongy overly sweet cupcake  birthday cupcake. Or drink those horrible, calorie laden drinks. Canned fruit. Soggy pizza. It doesn't matter how ""good the ""therapy"" is when the disconnection is so profound. Teach what is truly nutritious. Teach joy. Most ""chefs"" and nutritionists in these facilities have no clue about food. An angle that looked at the facility's (and our ""health care"" system's) relationship to food in the context of the patients' struggles would have been more enlightening.",1498953600,22,909,5.141891891891892
2635093,3,B000HEVZA8,"This film did a good job of showing the feelings and difficulties facing women with anorexia and bulimia. I think it would be better if there had been more interaction with psychiatrists, and also if there had been interviews with the psychiatrists to explain certain aspects of the diseases and the reasons behind some of the treatments. It felt incomplete to me, sort of a glimpse of what it's like to have an eating disorder rather than an in-depth view.

Another thing that really bothered me was the fact that a number of the people who worked at the facility were overweight, some even morbidly obese. Chronic overeating is just as much of an eating disorder as anorexia or bulimia. These employees were not good role models for the girls and women who were trying to conquer anorexia and bulimia. In fact, the obese women should have been in a program of their own. As a chronic overeater myself, I am familiar with that particular eating disorder and I felt the clinic was sending a mixed message to its patients.

This film had good intentions but it lacked focus, it lacked demonstration of the science behind the treatment of eating disorders, and it didn't even explain such simple things as the significance behind the different pulse rates and the reason they were checking fingernails for pinkness or blueness. I know they couldn't cover everything in less than two hours, but it could have been more scientific and more explicit.",1498262400,6,1445,4.7991967871485945
2635094,3,B000HEVZA8,"This is a horrifying documentary of an ineffectual treatment of several women with eating disorders. This life threatening disease exhibiting the mindset that ""It's more important to be thin than alive."" is heart breaking and frustrating to witness. The patient's willingness to speak candidly was surprising and illuminating. However, seeing the treatment of the patients committed in this particular institute was a nightmare. I watched with unbelieving eyes as patients with a fear of becoming fat, were being coerced to eat a SAD diet (Standard American Diet) by obese staff. Like that's not going to backfire! Eating disorders are believed to have at least some psychological component based in control issues. Here the staff were shown as being far more interested in fighting control battles than helping the patients heal their core issues that created their eating disorders. I can't think of a better way to get the patients to push back, practice deceit, or lie. I was incensed to watch the staff ""vote an patient off the island"" for a minor infraction of the rules, out of compassion for her friend, only to end up dead shortly after being scapegoated. The depressing outcome of these woman speaks volumes to how ineffective the approach was. I would love to see what programs have better results and how they differ from this one.",1498003200,4,1343,5.054054054054054
2635095,2,B000HEVZA8,"I can't recommend this to anyone... it is not proper education of the reality of the disorder or the thoughts that plague the mind when dealing with an eating disorder. I was too angry because these facilities that are pretending to ""treat"" women with eating disorders are treating them like children or criminals. Do they not understand that the root issue is already feeling like something is WRONG with you? This made women look as though they are outcasts or like they are somehow different than everyday people because their mental struggles happen to be more visible than other people who struggle... shame. I feel like going about these types of treatments would not truly cure somebody... probably make them worse in some cases.",1495929600,7,736,4.943548387096774

2635097,3,B000HEVZA8,"As an ED sufferer for almost two decades who has finally began to heal I would have liked to have seen more resolve from at least some of the patients.

ED's are tricky and not easily overcome but I feel like the documentary could have displayed more of the core issues of those who struggle with ED. It seems as if part of the reason why it's so difficult to recover from ED's is the fact that it's  a symptom of deeper issues having very little to do with actual food.

 Though the documentary does a good job showing how hard the disorder is to overcome I would have liked to see more on the root causes of this disorder and how it CAN be overcome and or managed. It was kind of depressing to see these women fall back into their illnesses to such severe degrees and even die. I know it is a reality but there are many recovery stories as well.. even if it's never a full recovery and the road is long things are getting better with those who suffer from this nasty illness.",1494201600,6,977,4.180851063829787
2635098,5,B000HEVZA8,"As a recovering bulimic this hit home hard.  I related with these women.  It is sad how insurance kept them from staying and getting the proper care.  Unless you have been where they have it is hard to understand how they are thinking that is why I gave this 5 stars.  This showed the pain, I felt (and still do at times) that they were going through.",1493856000,,351,4.1940298507462686
2635099,5,B000HEVZA8,"I think this documentary was well done. I don't know anything about treatment for eating disorders but some of the people at Renfrew seemed very harsh and even condescending. I wonder what the success rate is for people who complete the program there. After watching this documentary, I realize though, that even after doing well for a period, it's all too easy to go back to old, destructive habits when you are suffering from an eating disorder, as with any psychological disorder, and sometimes there is no happy ending, as in Polly's case. Sad, but very interesting and informative.",1493164800,2,586,4.929292929292929
2635100,3,B000HEVZA8,Horrible! But all these ladies are adults. Why nor to let them live their lives as they want it? What is the purpose of their lives? What is the cost of medical care that they hate and refuse? What a waste for themselves and society?,1491091200,,233,4.2
2635101,4,B000HEVZA8,"I liked this film overall. What it lacked was more of a history of eating disorders and why they happen. The most disturbing sub-plot of the film was how quickly the program devolved into an authoritative state. Counselors at rehabs often have limited education and experience. I felt the staff had an overall demeaning judgmental attitude toward their patients. The staff seemed more fascinated with their own power and ability to dominate. This dynamic has been well documented in social psychology. The whole educational and organizational model of rehabs needs to be completely re-examined. The staff were clearly unqualified, under educated in psychology, unsympathetic and sadistic.",1491004800,3,688,5.5
2635102,5,B000HEVZA8,"As a clinician and a woman who has struggled with an eating disorder for a majority of my life, I am truly dismayed. From the unprofessional behavior of the staff to the poorly trained clinicians that these women risked putting themselves in the care of. Unsurprising that Polly died after being scapegoated and dismissed from care. Clearly not the first time she had been deemed ""the bad seed"", but saddening that there was not a clinician there that could see she was actually doing the work she was there to do and instead, colluded with her behavior and the enactment. Very dysfunctional and unhealthy treatment center.",1489881600,2,623,4.886792452830188

2635115,5,B000HEVZA8,Loved it! Very accurate of what it's like in treatment! I've been there a few times and like how raw it was! Kudos to those willing to be brave and share the agony of what it's really like to suffer with an eating disorder.,1486339200,,223,4.090909090909091
2635116,5,B000HEVZA8,Very interesting. This is a real disease and this documentary sheds a positive light that treatment can help these girls get there life back and you can overcome this terrible disease,1486339200,,183,4.935483870967742
2635117,5,B000HEVZA8,"I recommend this film for several reasons. First, so that people who have never experienced an eating disorder can gain insight into the real anguish of sufferers. If you know someone, be it family or friend, with this disorder, it is important for you to get a sense of the real mental monster these people struggle against. Second, I recommend this film so that people can get an insight into the obstacles that prevent full recovery in the mental health care system. While I commend many of the staff for their compassion and their willingness to face such a difficult disorder day after day in their patients, there are some serious problems with treatment. As someone who has suffered from anorexia, and has since fully recovered, I can testify that these power struggles between staff and patients other reviewers have noted do absolutely nothing to help recovery and are prevalent in many treatments.

The real crux of the issue is that these mental professionals are rightly concerned with the immediate physical health of their patients and so can get aggressive in their tactics to get patients to eat. While this may work within the confines of the patient facility, it falls apart once the patients leave the facility. The real work to cure anorexia or bulimia lies in tackling the psychological issues, particularly control issues. These kinds of problems can only be remedied over very long periods of time, years or even decades, but these professionals are concerned the patients will drop dead before that time. So I understand why professionals may feel it necessary to put patients in a highly controlled environment. But the thing is, the patient will then relapse once released from the facility, often spectacularly, because having control robbed from them exacerbates the eating disorder.

I know for myself, it took a full five years for me to fully escape the mental trappings anorexia. I remember the person who helped most was a university councelor who gave me the one thing I needed most and that was love and compassion so that I felt safe to give up my control. Thats whats wrong with these treatment facilities; the patient is not made to feel safe and loved enough to relinquish that control over their bodies.

 I remember that I was sent to one mental health professional that I only visited for three sessions. I had admitted myself and was fully cognizant that I had a problem and was very ready to receive help. However, this professional repeatedly insisted I had lied to her since I told her Ive never thrown up. I have never thrown up, not once since I was fourteen due to food poisoning. Not even when Ive been sick with the stomach flu. I have a notoriously strong stomach and keep down practically anything, something my parents always found funny. So I didn't know what to say to this professional. I hadnt thrown up so how could I say that I had? I really felt for Shelley when the nutritionist accused her of purging. Its a very unnerving feeling to feel that the whole world doesnt believe you when you know you're telling the truth.

 And this kind of demonization of the person with the eating disorder only reassures him or her that it is not safe to relinquish control. It is striking that, as with other eating disorders such as compulsive binging or just simple overeating, the disorder is framed in terms of character (as seen with the integrity stick in the film or American medias dehumanization of obese people by assuming they are morally flawed). How do you think it makes the patient feel? Like the world is safe and they are fundamentally whole, decent people and so it is okay to let go of ineffective coping measures? I assure you just the opposite occurs.

For any of you that have someone suffering, let your loved one know they are loved and you don't want to rob them of their autonomy or power. You want them to be more powerful by kicking out the anorexia/bulimia/etc that makes them unhappy.  Remind them that their fellow humans want them to stay in the world and contribute to it but acknowledge to them that ultimately the decision to remain in the human community lies in their hands. For anyone suffering an eating disorder, find a support system which allows you to feel emotionally and spiritually safe so that you can begin to confront control issues and low self-worth. Allow a safe person or persons in so they can help you grapple with the eating disorder. If someone disrespects or misunderstands you, try to understand it often comes from a place of ignorance but also concern.",1485561600,8,4561,4.7572692793931735

2635148,4,B000HEVZA8,"Wow.  I feel compelled to write about this documentary, not for how it was produced, content or even its portrayal of the subject matter of eating disorders, but for the wide-open rawness of treatment centers.  And, sadly, this is the problem.  The Renfrew Center should be ashamed of themselves.  These women are at their lowest, they are open and vulnerable.  The staff lacks the skills to provide empathy toward these women.  From forcing the women to play games against each other to false accusations by the staff shows the only empowerment provided in that center is to the staff themselves.  These women need to feel encouraged.  They need to feel like they can trust.  They need to feel understood and loved.  And the worst part, how they called the one patient a ""bad seed"" and kicked her out - the woman died. How can you trust this staff? Shame on them.  I had treatment well over 20 years ago.  It was not even an eating disorder treatment center, but a psychiatric center - and let me tell you that they did not know how to treat an eating disorder.  BUT - they showed compassion.  They helped me to focus on getting control of my life.  They did not control me.  You know what?  They never even forced me to eat. I left that place knowing that I will always be OK in the world - that I got this.  Understanding eating disorders - well that's a hard one.  I look at it as a slow suicide.  And maybe that is how it needs to be treated.  How do you help someone who is suicidal? Perhaps that is where they need to start.  And you know what?  Making someone feel needed, understood and loved can go a long way.",1480291200,8,1620,4.3624161073825505

She eventually went into treatment, which back then just meant sitting in with a psychiatrist three days a week, but she did eventually get over it.  She is still very thin, but no longer throwing up her food or starving herself.  That said, I do have to question the 'treatment' involved at the facility, as shown.  Maybe it was just the way it was depicted in the film, but it seemed more like a military camp than a treatment facility for ED's to me.  Not that I'm an expert.  I just felt some of the back and forth from the counselors seemed petty and not in a helpful way.  I also question how a facility for anorexics could justify having several obese employees on their staff.  Isn't overeating a form of ED, as well?",1480204800,,927,4.343023255813954

No real discussion about the physical or psychological causes for eating disorders, the methods that can be used to treat it, etc. The show basically ended by showing that all the girls they followed failed treatment.

People should never get kicked out because insurance won't pay or for making mistakes.  That's like throwing peoples' lives away.  I hope that every person who works in those clinics realizes the responsibility they have, and that they actually have control over the patients lives-whether they live or die and they ALWAYS show compassion to them and treat them with respect.  Unless people have walked that path themselves, they can't possibly understand, I don't care how long they went to college or where.

2635179,4,B000HEVZA8,"This was a very intimate view inside an eating disorder treatment facility. I really can't believe they were allowed to film some of this; i.e. the sessions with the therapist, etc. Seemed very intrusive on the patient. But it did allow the viewer inside the world of eating disorders, and it ain't pretty. There are lots of cringe-y things, most notably coming from the staff themselves. It was really frustrating to see how patronizing they were to the patients, and how insensitive some of their comments were. All in all, a fantastic documentary, but not for the faint of heart.",1472947200,3,582,4.83
2635180,5,B000HEVZA8,"It's difficult to place my reaction to this film in words. For about the first third to half of it I was repelled by the behaviour of nearly everyone in it - the women in treatment seemed all pretty unsympathetic personalities, and the staff of the facility came off even worse. There is quite a bit of histrionic narcissism and callousness on display, and the culture of the treatment facility is softly totalitarian in unappealing ways. It all annoyed me. I almost stopped watching, but let the film run anyway..

And somewhere about the midway point my reaction changed. Sympathy began to build, and then I realized that I was watching something I really don't understand.  I'm male.  And while I've had my own emotional and psychological issues to wrestle with in life, I have never had any problem eating. I've never had to inhabit a woman's skin, I've never experienced what it is to internalize objectification like the women in this documentary have. I was initially tempted to dismiss them as merely vain or envious - as if they were superficial, and their feelings - their agony, even - not serious. Watching this, I realized that it's more complicated, deeper, than I could have imagined.

Watching Alica purge after eating dinner with her two kids and Shelley the very evening they were discharged from the program at the end of the film blew me away.. it nearly brought me to tears. How heartbreaking. How sad. Can't she see how beautiful she is? Can't all these women see they are? Then I realized that those very questions are vexed, and at the root of the whole pathology blooming in our culture, the spiritual cancer that's eating them, us, away..

I feel like I've been given a series of lessons here. Important ones, where a veil's been lifted on a world I'd never realized was there.

Some of the lessons are half formed - for example, the ethos of the facility (as others have said here) seemed infantilizing and many of the staff interactions inauthentic and uncaring. When they asked Polly to leave the program for what seemed a series of essential misdemeanors like smoking in her room, getting a tattoo and giving Shelly two illicit psych pills, I was a bit outraged. It seemed rather extreme. But I have to admit that I don't understand enough to criticize any of them, and that whatever they are doing at that facility is far beyond my experience to judge.

My initial reaction to the film was that it was in bad taste - unseemly exhibitionism. Now that I've come to the end, I have to say that I think the four women depicted in it are rather heroic. They didn't have to share this with us.  They didn't have to teach me what they've taught me. I'd like to thank them for having the courage to share their lives with us. I looked the four of them up online, and have learnt that Polly has since passed away. I pray her soul rests in peace. I hope all the other people in this film have found peace and healing, and I hope that anyone out there struggling with an eating disorder does the same. You may not feel it, but you are beloved.

I imagine this documentary might be watched by those people who suffer or are acquainted with a sufferer of anorexia; however, I doubt it will give them hope. One useful bit of information, though, is to avoid this place. It would be better to seek out universities who are researching this topic and get referrals from them for modern, effective treatment programs. Though anorexia is notoriously difficult to treat, a decent clinic will be open about their success rates. Perhaps a small subset of viewers of ""Thin"" might be those who could, at best, be called voyeuristic.

My heart goes out to these girls who are in various states of hell to begin with, then being subjected to more by the way they are treated, basically like prisoners. From the time they walk in they are searched and later there is a level of interrogation that is quite disturbing. The staff are well meaning people but may really want to rethink their strategy. It is my opinion that this facility may be causing further psychological damage and could be considered abusive. At one point a patient named Polly is called ""a bad seed"" during a staff meeting. The staff then kicked her out thinking it would benefit the other patients. Wow! I was left feeling at a loss for these girls, three of which did not recover and one of which died.

Spoiler alert: The Renfrew's treatment model is expensive, ludicrous, humiliating and ineffective--all of the patients relapse immediately upon leaving the facility. At least one featured in this film ended up dead. The staff ranges from plump to morbidly obese--that must really inspire hope and trust within this patient population. The food--nutritionist approved!--looks cheap, unappetizing and devoid of nutrients. If a patient, by some miracle, actually shows a modicum of improvement under this regime, the insurer immediately ends coverage and she is forced to leave the facility. I can only hope that documentaries like this one can lead to some positive changes. (And read the well-written New York Times review of this film.)",1465689600,11,912,5.475177304964539

2635350,3,B000HEVZA8,"I rarely write reviews but I believe this subject matter (all types of eating disorders ""ED"") is still relevant today, and I have some constructive suggestions to anyone who is currently dealing with these issues. If the director/producers intended this documentary to bring an awareness/compassion towards others who may be dealing with ED, it might have this effect. However, after watching this documentary, I would NOT send a loved one who is suffering to any ""treatment"" facility similar to the one shown here for many reasons (too many to list here). The documentary ends by providing a brief follow up summary of progress or lack thereof, for the four ladies who share their experiences. It is quite effective in cementing the severity of ED (death is a significant risk). I think it would also be more effective by providing a statistical commentary at the beginning or the end of the film, so that the message has a stronger impact - that ""Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness,"" according to [...]/.

I agree with other reviewers that the vast majority of the media/health industry are more concerned about the health consequences of obesity and the alarming health consequences of obesity, than showing concern for those who are struggling with ""self-inflicted"" nutritional starvation. On a superficial level, it appears that these extreme situations of ""self-inflicted"" starvation and gorging (exact opposite) are vastly different, but they are related - lack of self-management with respect to food. Most ED start early in life, before full brain development (23-25), and before most people have developed good judgment skills and a balanced perspective in life. Most people in this age group (under 25) have not acquired a basic understanding of their bodies, so it's not surprising that some people will try ""messing"" with their bodies (self-deprivation, self-purging, and self-gorging), especially when we are bombarded every waking hour with unattainable images of beauty/body proportions applicable for most 99 % percent of the population. In a ""twin"" situation, it appears that the sibling not suffering from ED becomes the comparative ""standard,"" instead of a media-manipulated ""beautiful/ thin/ successful model"" standard. Another message would be to put things into perspective. If improving one's health is the genuine motivation for starving oneself of nutrition, then ED is certainly NOT the way to obtain results.  The constructive solution is to seek the help of a nutritionist who can explain how the brain and body function, develop a nutritional plan for your ideal weight, and teach how to select groceries and prepare healthy food. I personally would not have touched anything served at the ""treatment"" center - all loaded with refined sugar and unhealthy fats.  I would hope that other treatment centers provide higher quality of food so that the brain/body have the opportunity for repair (past damage) before any psychological treatment ensues. Nutritionally dense food improves one's metabolism and actually helps to burn fat more effectively. It's sad that many people suffer from ED and some have died because of the fear of getting fat or losing control.

I would like to see a follow up film where at least one of these ladies learns to remove the fear of eating/gaining weight by developing 3 health-promoting skills (preparing high quality food, modest and regular exercise, and adequate sleep).  The pernicious nature of ED has been well demonstrated. A follow up film that provides hope and inspiration for change could save many lives.

I have personally watched an acquaintance in grad school suffer from ED. When I met her, she was a beautiful and athletic woman 22, (5' 7'') 125 lbs, who starved herself to 90 lbs in 3 months, and 6 months later, her weight was 200 lbs. We were both 22 at the time. I remember thinking how hard the loss and gain of excess weight was on her mind/body. She wouldn't acknowledge her problem to others who knew her well (friends). I don't know what became of her, but I still remember her after 28 years. All women diet or manage some level of weight control (eating less or exercising more when needed), but the danger appears to be when weight control becomes the central focus of one's existence.  It appears to start initially with a desire to lose weight due to a low self-esteem about their body proportions/weight or a ""self-improvement"" strategy, and then it becomes something more serious (classifiable as a mental illness) - when they don't know how to stop their destructive thoughts and behavior.  It appears that they want to see ""progress,"" and this translates to continuing to lose weight. They lose all perspective.  They can't see that ""thin and dying"" is not the same thing as being ""successful."" They suffer from depression - but who wouldn't be if they were starving?

For those with ED: Remember that the super models enjoying the longest careers (30 years plus) are those who take care of themselves (high nutrition, exercise, and sleep), and WHO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THEIR MINDS. They don't abuse themselves. I hope this long comment helps  to steer at least one person in a more healthy direction. Food is not evil. Nutritious food empowers your mind and body to be the best you can be and to enjoy your life.",1456790400,,5344,5.054483541430193

2635395,4,B000HEVZA8,"As all of the other reviewers noted- of course its sad and depressing and alarming. But what goes unsaid is how this disease relates to women (and to a lesser extent men -often gay). Sometimes it was hard to feel empathy for them because they act like spoiled little girls whose only recourse to control is by torturing themselves. Its an elaborate way to get attention... a form of pathological narcissism because they are obsessing over how they LOOK. The problem starts with society and its pressures on the appearance of women. Viewing yourself as something that is always on display, always pretty and perfect is nothing short of soul-crushing.  But it also relates to class (its primarily a middle class disease) and is something thats relatively new historically.

Greenfield is not afraid to get in there. The girls are complicated- not just one-sided victims, and the parents are often AWFUL. No wonder these girls are plagued with problems.

To kick out a patient was unprofessional and unethical. Instead of separation after her mother pleaded with clinical care, all the clinician's were in favor to get rid of the patient. Maybe a criminal action would have sufficed and continuance of her treatment? Punishment for a positive tattoo regarding the strength to beat her disorder. To ask a young girl by a staff member of the facility, ""why are you doing this to yourself?"" This question was a stupid. The client is there because she wants to be thin...duh and needs treatment to stop her deadly habits of thiness. That question made more anxiety and stress to her and I hope at sometime during the filming staff took her out and talked with her alone and gave her something to calm her.
Another aspect of this documentary care management was the medical insurance. Once some medical insurance's don't pay, an administrator in this film attempts to convince the untreated young girl to be, ""able to say goodbye,"" and ""move on.""

Lastly, some insurance companies (during the time of the filming of this documentary) do not want to pay and set rules of how long, and how far treatment should be. I wonder if their consulting physicians are expert in this  medical/psychological disorder and if the insurance companies feel they are losing money due to the patient's condition.",1442361600,4,1604,4.955390334572491

2635436,3,B000HEVZA8,"Though this documentary was filmed at a locked treatment center, it does not show anyone getting better. Some women started restricting and/or purging the day they were released. Released in 2006, this was filmed ten years ago. Let's hope there are better treatment options today. The staff appears at times to be as lost as the patients, and the male therapist with the dyed black hair may be doing more harm than good. One obese staff member laughingly states that she obviously doesn't know the answer to disordered eating. Most of the patients' parents who visit are pretty confused as well. They don't understand the disorder, the therapy, or their own role in it, and there is a good deal of anger evident, which suggests that individual as well as family therapy might be in order for all concerned. The deeply self-destructive nature of the disorder as well as the reasons why it is so difficult to treat is never really addressed. Though the film is certainly graphic in terms of showing girls a couple of the girls vomiting, no description of exactly why this practice is so dangerous is offered. None of the girls seems aware that there is anything going on in the world that is more important than themselves and how the look. The obsession over each ounce gained or lost is reinforced by mandatory daily 6:00 a.m. weigh-ins. The medical staff at these weigh-ins seem as exhausted and indifferent as the patients themselves. The real truth hits hard in the last minutes, when we learn that of the three girls most featured, one has relapsed and been readmitted, one lost 17 pounds shortly after release, and one is dead. This leaves the viewer to conclude that Renfrew's treatment is ineffective, despite its high cost. There are no success stories presented here, which presumably Renfrew would wish to feature. I do hope things are better now than ten years ago

It is hard not to judge both the patients and the staff. A week spent serving the poor at a community soup kitchen might do more good than the treatment offered here, at least as documented in the film. The patients they chose to feature are without exception immature and narcissistic, and seem to come from some degree of middle-class affluence at home. It would have presented a more balanced view to see male patients and persons of color, as well as older patients. The stereotype of the spoiled white rich young girl is reinforced here, perhaps unfairly. The viewer is left with the impression that anorexia and bulimia cannot be treated successfully, which is a pretty depressing conclusion, and it offers patients and their families no encouragement. Still, I'd recommend this documentary for everyone. Most of us know someone with this disorder, and it offers insight into just how difficult to treat it can be..",1442102400,8,2798,4.84133611691023

I missed a lots of college classes and my grade was not good. Finally I asked a help to my parents, I went to see a doctor and get hormone shots regularly. I gained so much weights more than before, it was very difficult but I knew I had to get thorough this. My life was changed, I got my health back on track, graduated college, started to do exercise regularly, got a job, got a social life, then my weight started to come off naturally and I've stayed on healthy weight since then.

2635523,5,B000HEVZA8,"I am 100 pounds lighter than I was 13 years ago. I love watching tv shows about people who lose massive amounts of weight. I was going to download one from Amazon prime and I saw this movie, THIN, about anorexic women. It is a reality show in a treatment center for eating disorders.

I found that after more than a decade of keeping my weight off and having to relose 20 pounds that comes back on, I related better to the anorexic women. While it is extreme and unhealthy, they work diligently to lose weight and avoid becoming fat. There is nothing lazy about these people. Indeed, they are upset when they cannot keep working at it.

I thought it was interesting that the obese people in the weight loss shows tend to blame others for their size; an alcoholic father, negligent mother, overfeeding spouse, depression, anxiety, grief, the anorexic women did not blame others for their size. Indeed, they felt in control when they did not eat or did things to counteract their caloric intake.

It was also striking to me that many of them looked ""good"" in terms of societal vision of attractiveness even though most weighed under 100 pounds. They would not have looked better at a normal BMI of 23. If you look at our female role models on tv, I'm thinking of news reporters in particular, they do not heavier than these women who are in treatment. There's something wrong with this picture.

I have to say that it was disheartening to see the center belittling the patients, treating them like evil children, talking horribly about them behind their back, and being mostly punitive rather than supportive. I hope that they are reading this.",1428192000,5,1642,4.651724137931034

2635538,3,B000HEVZA8,"ALERT: spoilers ahoy!

This movie reveals more about the messed up, insurance-dominated American medical world than it does about eating disorders. Patients seem to arrive popping a basketful of pills (many that likely cancel out each other) and speak in group environments with an authority that implies they're already cured. They seem to relax in an environment where everyone is in the same place, and retreat the moment they are forced to interact with others. The more revealing moments happened through the families, some of whom have long legacies of eating disorders, while others are completely exhausted by the situation. This was especially potent through the rant of Shelley's sister, who has been the subject of Shelley's jealousy and insecurities, and is just exhausted by her demand for constant coaching, approval, and assistance. It was a very honest moment in a film that was somewhat dominated by the subjects that were quite plainly manipulating directors and lying to them.

I don't know if its possible to watch this without becoming an armchair psychiatrist, and I found myself drawing radically different conclusions than what was often revealed here. Polly was kicked out for being the ""ringleader"" when to me she was just the loudest; if I had to pick someone to kick out it would be the one talking other people out of their psychiatric medication, and then reporting this behavior the moment she faced any reprimand for such actions herself. Shelly was preoccupied with being blamed or being in trouble, and yet she seemed to always be right there in the center of it. I think the nutritionist accused her of hiding food because she accurately identified her tendency towards manipulation. Meanwhile, Polly is kicked out, which is just kind of absurd when you consider that she was progressing through the various steps and earning compliments before this incident. The people working in the clinic seemed more concerned with the fact that she got a tattoo than they did with the pill passing going on between patients. People working in psychiatric fields should have better BS detectors than that.

Still: what a difficult job to have, and what a thankless task. I can't fathom being an eating disorder therapist, with so much treatment that only sometimes works.",1426377600,3,2294,5.0795755968169765

2635556,2,B000HEVZA8,"I'm not sure what the purpose of this film was.  It does not appear to focus on treatment, it does not appear to focus on an indictment of treatment, it just sort of wombles around showing us a handful of women who are in a resident program for eating disorders, but why are we watching this?  They weigh the girls, they take their vitals daily, they record what they eat and drink (remember, these are women who are obsessed with measuring themselves, weighing themselves, tracking every little calorie, every bite - this is part of their disease, so I don't see this doing anything but reinforcing negative behaviour), they are NOT allowed to exercise (shouldn't they be in supervised programs like yoga, meditation, maybe tai chi - mindful movement courses?), so it seems to me all they have to do all day long is focus on themselves in unhealthy ways.  If anything else IS going on, we're not seeing it here.  And to top it off, instead of surrounding them with people who have a healthy body weight and condition, they are surrounded by staffers who appear to represent the opposite end of the eating disorder spectrum - many of them are considerably overweight and out of condition.  And the meals they are fed?  Ugh, who WOULD want to eat that?Doesn't seem like much of a solution to me.  Seems more like a glorified insurance scam than a real treatment center - and of course when the womens' insurance runs out, out they go.  A few little comments here and there also seemed to indicate that at least some of the women are repeaters, so I guess when the insurance kicks in again the following year they can go back.  I don't really recommend this film to anyone.",1424736000,6,1671,4.580536912751678

But man, it was depressing!  Don't watch this if you're hoping for something that will leave you with any shred of hope that we understand how to treat people with eating disorders.

I would agree with some of the negative reviews that the treatment center did not make a positive impression.  It truly seemed like jail, no exaggeration.  They were woken up at the crack of dawn to be weighed, they had no control over what they put into their bodies, were subjected to nitpicky rules seemingly without any explanation about why they exist (why no tattoos?), room searches, and condescending treatment by the staff.  I'm no expert, but it seemed obvious to me that forcing women to eat and gain wait that have eating disorders would not be a successful treatment strategy long term.  What's the plan when they leave and are no longer being all but force fed?  The documentary noted that Renfrew wanted one of the patients to move to Florida to continue outpatient treatment.  Not realistic.  And the patient that DID uproot her family and move to be close to Renfrew STILL didn't have a positive outcome.

Spoiler alert:  Despite the hard line, know-it-all, treat-them-like prisoners structure of the Renfrew Center, not one of the patients was able to leave treatment and keep her disorder under control.  After being there for months, they showed 2 of the ladies reverting to their old behaviors the day they left treatment.  All of that time and money for nothing.  If I learned anything from this documentary, it's that more money needs to be spent on research for how people with eating disorders can truly be helped.  What's the point of pumping millions of dollars into places like Renfrew if their success rate is close to 0%?",1424131200,3,1805,4.827361563517916

I struggled with eating disorders for the last 2 years and I am getting so much better now. I used to binge and make myself throw up for like 2-3 times a day and almost EVERYDAY! I would keep eating and purging and eating and purging over and over... I was depressed, anxious and I felt like I don't have any hopes. I was always unhappy and unsatisfied. I felt fat, I felt weak, I felt guilty, I felt helpless.. Anyways looking back now, I can't believe I treated myself like that. I felt like I had wasted all those times and all I did was hurting myself and hurting my family. I could have spent those time doing something productive or just simply having fun. I do regret that I did all of those terrible things to myself for 2 years. BUT I am more thankful that I am recovered now!! I haven't binged for 4 months and I've never felt healthier and happier before. I felt like I got a new life a new chance to live the life I want! There are a lot of factors might contribute to eating disorders like family issue, peers, social influences, romantic relationships, stressful life events... BUT for me, I think expect for all of those, I had my own problems. I didn't know how to manage stress (I am still learning now). I didn't appreciate what I already have. I had an unhealthy ""ideal"" body image. I didn't know how to take care of myself and cherish all the love from my family, my friends, my boyfriends, my church community...

We don't really talk about them much anymore, as we are living in a world of obesity for adults and children alike.  Having been on both ends of the spectrum myself (once being ridiculously thin and then weighing 40 lbs more than I do now), this is an interesting profile of people who are living with anorexia and bulimia.  Here we follow four women who are going into inpatient treatment for their eating disorders, we see how they feel at different points during their treatment times.  They form a little clique and then start defying the rules of the clinic, they live in sort of a dream world where all they think about is food and how they can avoid eating food or absorbing calories and be a size 2/0.  They enjoy their time on the smoke porch but hate the dining room for obvious reasons, talk about their halted futures and how they have associated all the bad things in life with food.  It takes a toll on your physical and mental health when you are of either extreme, and how they have put themselves into such a mindset to resist eating anything.  One tried to commit suicide over eating two pieces of pizza.  There has to be a happy medium, and one must find that happy medium.

One thing that this latently profiles is the state of treatment for eating disorders.  Many will go right back to their bad behaviors after they have left their treatment.  They are bent on convincing the person to eat and eliminating bad behaviors (hiding food, eliminating alone time, etc.) while they are in the facility, but despite the group therapy and individual attentions, they will not turn their behaviors around for the better.  I think you have to ask yourself if being a size 0 is really going to make you happy.  The answer to this, obviously, is no, it will kill you.  But we have equated happiness with being thin.  Is it right to do so?  That's up for debate.  There is a limit, yet also a contradiction.",1418947200,6,1991,4.486111111111111

One sees the commonalities in the girls and womens' warped thinking, and that once this disorder takes hold, it truly is a bona fide mental illness. There is a common childish/ childlike affect amongst the girls (of all ages), a stuntedness and obvious drive to stay in a childlike or even infantile state..and one can't help but wonder, does the disease create or trigger these traits or were they there before the disorder took hold?

After watching, I went to google to discover outcome of some of the girls, and immediately I stumbled on a ''pro ana'' forum where many mentioned seeing this doc multiple times; (''pro ana'' refers to support and advice for people with anorexia, which actually encourages it). This made me feel this film could possibly be a kind of ''pro ana porn'' for anorexics, and maybe triggering to relapse, so caution advised.",1417651200,,1034,4.971098265895954

I give it four stars, because I agree with whoever on here mentioned the lack of a ""friendlier"" or ""warmer"" environment for these young women.  I don't know anything about how to treat eating disorders as severe as were shown in this documentary, so my opinion is solely a lay person's.  It is admirable that these young women opened themselves to the camera crew in such a way - yet, I cannot help wonder if that also may have been, at least partially, a symptom of their illness: anything to get attention.  It was sad to read at the end that the 30-something had eventually died, and I hope that the rest of the women we met are now OK.

A fascinating look at a disorder that affect many in our society.  But I am not sure that it will help anybody who already are in the grips of this nasty illness; it did not go into enough deep insights into how to prevent or how to help someone with this challenge in her life.  I do understand the time limits of airing a documentary - and that the cause of every person's eating disorder might be different, although there certainly seems to be many common causes, too.

Some troubling observations:  Renfrew was not a ""locked"" facility, i.e., bathrooms were not locked and patients were given an enormous amount of freedom, which had many of them continuing to purge.  Some of the staff members were quick to judgment without pursuing the facts--the nutritionist who accuses Shelley of hiding food in her room without even looking into the story comes to mind.  I felt that she was destructive and actually did harm.  Last, while it was hard to watch Polly being asked to leave, it was absolutely necessary.  People like her encourage others to flout the rules and push the envelope--and that is the worst that they can do.

While persons with ED certainly need structure modeled for them, I can only imagine that Renfrew also helps them prepare for the chaos outside their walls. I would hope that Renfrew teaches them that some rules are, indeed, a little bendable, and that each client possesses an inner well of good judgment because eating, after all, is far from an exact science. A healthy approach to food requires an inner book of food wisdom and a ""tuning in"" to one's self. Also I would hope that Renfrew churns out more successes than were depicted in this documentary.

2635784,4,B000HEVZA8,"I saw this movie about a year after it initially aired, and have watched it a few times since as well. I myself am an eating disorder survivor (anorexia nervosa), and there are a few things that stick out in my mind that should be considered before choosing to view this.

First of all, if you are in active recovery from an eating disorder and you are vulnerable (i.e. easily triggered) and you are interested in pushing through hard times, DO NOT watch this yet. Everyone's triggers are different, but this film shadows four young women as they describe AND PERFORM eating disordered behavior whilst in treatment (so a certain level of deception is involved). One of the women describes a suicide attempt (and sadly after this aired one of the women featured did complete her attempt) and admitted using the G tube in her stomach as the route of delivery.

*It should be noted that tube feeding is a point of contention within both the actively ill communities as well as those for ones who are trying to get well. Again, viewing this will be DETRIMENTAL to your recovery process if you are new, struggling, or currently in hospital or resi right now. I beg you to please think carefully before watching this.*

Second, the film doesn't do a wonderful job as far as educating the public at large about what and eating disorder looks like in every day life as opposed to in resi. Loved ones and others concerned for a friend (or themselves) aren't going to be able to resonate with any of these ladies (aged 15 y/o to 30) because they are full blown into their illness so badly that they must be in a controlled environment so that they -- frankly -- don't kill themselves whether on purpose or by accident (and yes, the latter can and does happen). For those who are wanting to learn more about signs and symptoms that aren't quite so dramatic it would be much more wise and safer to view the documentary ""Perfect Illusions"" as was aired on PBS several years ago and is now available for sale on DVD or for free streaming elsewhere.

Third...as stated by a previous commenter, this film does justice to the travesty that is the cost of care for this life threatening psychological illness. Anorexia nervosa, especially those who also purge (or force vomit/engage is compensatory exercise), has the HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE of any other psychiatric illness including those who are drug addicted or suffer from the more ""classic"" diagnoses such as major depression or schizophrenia. Unlike other psychiatric illness, to treat eating disorders in an inpatient setting is a battle for the right to proper care: insurance rarely covers resi for an appropriate length of time (especially for those who aren't emaciated to the point of death) and acute hospitalization is usually limited to stabilizing electrolytes and then a shove out the door (that process may take five days at the most).

Finally, while brutally honest about the ugliness of the disease, this film insinuates that those who have eating disorders will lead a tortured existence for the remainder of their lives with little they can do to stop it. That hospitalization is the ONLY way of achieving recovery. This is 100% false; I struggled for years. I have the thoughts, and they are made worse by the fact that this disease destroyed my gut so now I depend of IV nutrition to survive. And I have lost several friends to this illness. But I, myself,  am better. I am years symptom free. I live a wonderful life.

There is always a choice, and it is yours to make.",1407024000,2,3527,4.706645056726094

2635788,5,B000HEVZA8,"I am giving this documentary 5 stars for a reason, because I believe it really takes you into the depths of how sick these individuals are that suffer with this disorder, the absolute lack of knowledge in how to help them, and the overall sadness that disorder brings into the lives of the individual but also the family, maybe most of all the family. When I see anorexics or bulemics I will be completely honest with you, all I think is, ""just f'ing eat you f'ing dummy"". Now, I know some people will say that is a horrible thing to think, and of course it is, but I think it comes from wanting them to get better and feeling that the answer is so simple. I know in my mind the answer is not really that simple but I still think ""just eat"" and things will get better. Their minds are so crippled with this disorder that they can't see reality from dilusion, it's like yelling at heroin addict, ""just stop doing drugs dummy and your life will be better"", it just doesn't work that way, and honestly I think these people may be in some ways worse off than a heroin addict.

2635814,4,B000HEVZA8,"I so didn't want to like this documentary. I'm glad I watched it till the end. Having an eating disorder myself I know exactly what its like. No matter how much you tell yourself you want to get better you really don't want to. My view of the Mental Health Community remains the same. Its a business no different than McDonalds. Once your insurance refuses to pay any longer you're out the door. For someone that really needs help, too bad. I don't even know why the Health Insurance Companies pay for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment. What other business can you run that make billions of dollars a year with about a 0% success rate. They should just shut down all of the treatment centers and replace them with community based systems run by people that have overcome their addictions and disorders. You could save a whole lot of money and I guarantee, you would at a minimum have the same success rate. You can take what I'm saying with a grain of salt as I'm in therapy at the moment for PTSD, but having spent a lifetime in and out of the system I can say from experience, the only ones that truly know what its like are those that are living it everyday.

I've probably should of read some of the other reviews first before commenting. There are a lot of misconceptions and the documentary didn't go into the real reasons people have an eating disorder in the first place. It appears as if everyone is obsessed with the way they look and in some ways that is true but it not the big issue. In my case I was sexually abused as a child. The eating disorder is just about control. Since you have no control over what happened to you, you end up substituting something in its place that you can control. The intense need to be in control is much more important than the way you look. The obsession with the way you look comes in later. I've been living with it for 50 years and one thing I know for sure the ED controls you not the other way around. From the time you wake up until you go to bed, everyday, day after day 24/7 non-stop it never shuts off. It's a strange mental illness I just do the best I can with. I'm male, so believe me there is no society pressure on me to be rail thin. I never remember a time I wasn't like this and I wasn't diagnosed anorexic until I was 36 while I was in drug rehab. Up until then I just thought it was normal behavior. In the eating disordered mind you can even convince yourself that it is about the way you look, but usually there is some underlying reason and that underlying reason needs to be dealt with first before you have any chance of moving on. I know for sure I didn't choose my eating disorder, it chose me.",1405987200,9,2676,4.267716535433071

2635846,2,B000HEVZA8,"Everyone has to eat, which is part of what makes eating disorders exceptionally difficult to treat. That said, I found it ironic that a large percentage of the staff who were treating the anorexic/bulimic patients at Renfrew were themselves obese. This struck me as bizarre, but it was never addressed, or even acknowledged. The message, which came through loud and clear, is that at Renfrew it's acceptable to be overweight and unhealthy, but not acceptable to be underweight and unhealthy. A lot of the staff seemed nearly as messed up psychologically as the patients, and some of them were creepily reminiscent of Nurse Ratched, especially in the awful group session/meeting in which one of the more cruel staff members succeeds in getting one patient (Shelly, a psychiatric nurse????) to rat out another (Polly), with the result that Polly is labeled a troublemaker and evicted from Renfrew. I also agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that the message one takes away is that treatment for eating disorders never works (at least, not at Renfrew), since the documentary only follows patients for whom treatment failed.",1404432000,5,1132,5.124324324324324

2635849,4,B000HEVZA8,"The documentary follows several patients through their treatment at a facility for anorexia.  As sad and raw as it was it only touched the surface of a illness with such deep roots in the psyche.  The documentary over covered so much, it did not delve into the inner workings of their mind that created such an obsession with eating to begin with.  The illness could have taken other forms of self-destruction such as drug addiction, alcoholism, but instead this form of self mutilation and self-punishment is done through the deprivation of food.

Very sad documentary, very sad that insurance companies actually set the boundaries for who can live and who can die.  It was a good documentary, but it certainly did not offer a avenue for a complete cure for this form of (hate to say it, but its true) mental illness.  I hate to imagine what foundation was laid for women and men (yes, men) to become anorexic in the first place.  Complete destruction of the ego?  Rape, trauma?  There is more to anorexia that just trying to be thin.  All my life I watched my diet, exercised and all, but there is a big difference between dieting and turning into a human skeleton that looks like they just ran out of a concentration camp.

2635880,5,B000HEVZA8,"This is a really good movie that offers insights into at least a part of the business of treating women with eating disorders. The patients, or clients, who feel badly about themselves, feel that they are unattractive and unable to manage their lives.  The direction that the treatment takes is a bit surprising because it seems to be designed to make the patients feel worse, to make them feel guilty and incompetent, to persuade them that they are sick and dependent and need to be pushed around.

I know I don't understand eating disorders, but I don't think the staff at this place understand them either.  Maybe nobody does.  Were it not for the fact that the staff seem to be laboring under the illusion that they are doing a great job, I would say that they were running a racket.",1402012800,4,787,4.560283687943262
2635891,3,B000HEVZA8,"There is really no such thing as ""normal"". I think every human being has a degree of self-image concerns, bouts of depression, fear of coping, etc. It is the degree to which we are susceptible to our human frailties that separates us from living ""normal"" lives and being a human train wreck.  Look at the myriad behaviors in which humans engage to cope with or mask their fears, feelings of worthlessness or loneliness. There's drugs, overeating, lying and cheating, and many, many ways to self-destruct.  Some are just more immediately obvious than others.  In this documentary, I watched 4 ""train wrecks.....young women who are so deeply disturbed, depressed and desperate that they have starved and purged themselves into a health abyss. They are each alternately sympathetic individuals and obnoxious narcissists whining over a bite of cupcake. The film gives us no real clue as to why these women are so depressed, except for the pitiful 15-year-old whose mother has an ED and probably supported her daughter's  massive weight loss of 187 to 98 pounds so she would fit in at school.  We do understand that hormones and body image in a teen are a potential disaster, as in this case where the child declares she wishes she could just be allowed to die...thin.  I was terrifed for this child, perhaps thinking ahead to when my darling granddaughters could be vulnerable to such an obsession.  Ultimately, I watched this wondering if we will ever understand enough about clinical and destructive depression to be able to help the afflicted. Or can we ever change our cultural world view to see that our love for starved, drugged, botox-crazy, surgically enhanced, steroidal stars and role models is killing our kids!

It did seem that these women have conditioned themselves to avoid or purge food as a control skill.  Three of them run off their rehab track because they are having so much fun bonding over their illness and breaking rules, despite their backgrounds in suicide and near-death hospitalizations.  One is a mother of 2 adorable kids. It seemed they were in ""treatment"", not to change their obsession with thinness, but find a way to stay thin without dying from it.

This documentary is supposedly ""triggering"" to people with ED, i.e. they watch these pitiful gaunt depressives vomiting and want to run out and do it too. Unbelievable.  It just shows how far they or we are from having any clue as to how to bring them back to reality and sanity. I certainly did not see any of the medical staff pictured in the film looking like they had a clue....just rules and a rather fakey ""caring"" manner. Their job was to just get the women back up to 100 pounds or so and say bye-bye....or sooner if insurance has run out.

 Ironically, I would think a trigger in the facility here, Renfrew, would be the ""preponderance"" of hefty to obese staff.  Truly, it cannot make sense to have these body-obsessed patients counseled about healthy eating by seriously obese nurses, therapists, doctors,etc.",1371168000,5,3003,4.883858267716535
2635892,5,B000HEVZA8,I like how it shows how people with eating disorders think and feel.  I also like that it was actual people and not actors.

2635895,5,B000HEVZA8,"Thin is a fascinating, candid documentary that focuses on four relatively young women being treated for eating disorders at The Renfrew Center in Florida; they have life-threatening cases of anorexia and bulimia and other issues, too. The film moves along well and also looks at how staff plan interventions in team meetings as well as how they treat patients either in group or individual settings. Indeed, it was all done in such a sensitive way that I was truly glued to the screen, wanting so badly to see these women fight and overcome their eating disorders--to what degree would they succeed and how, I wondered.

There is little new information about these women that I can offer you here; the names and basic facts about Shelly, Polly, Brittany and Alisa are pretty much known between what Amazon states above and what other reviewers have written! The other reviewers deserve praise for their well written and insightful reviews about this documentary.

What I can add is my own reaction to the movie. It's not always easy to watch; when I saw Alisa saying that ""if it takes dying to be (thin), at least I'll get there"" I felt so badly for her. It's not an easy path; these women are fighting a serious and chronic mental illness and therefore you just can't rationalize with them by saying ""just eat."" Even Shelly, herself trained as a nurse, just can't seem to get past her distorted body image: when a dietitian tells Shelly that her goal weight is a mere 100 pounds, Shelly looks shocked, overwhelmed and bewildered as to how she could ever achieve that weight--not to mention maintaining it! The group meeting near the end with Brittany and another patient so sad over how her life has gone is unforgettable.

In addition, people are people. As someone who has worked on an inpatient hospital ward, I was not surprised to see unhealthy ""cliques"" forming, patients sneaking cigarettes into the bathroom and people hiding food to avoid eating it. The staff at Renfrew seem to try their best and they work hard; but they weren't as careful or as well staffed as they could have been--otherwise bathrooms would be locked most if not all of the time; staff could accompany patients to the bathroom and give the patients at least a quick search before they entered the restroom (leaving them privacy in the bathroom, of course). I also agree with the reviewer who writes that Renfrew doesn't appear to offer treatment in the form of grocery shopping and eating at restaurants.

The DVD comes without bonus features but the film is so well done this becomes a minor quibble. Thin doesn't spend much time with men who have eating disorders; that would have been a terrific added feature but despite this Thin is still well done. It's interesting to find out what happened to these four women after they left Renfrew; three of them had to leave abruptly when their insurance ran out but the person who made the most progress surprised me! Some people think that Thin doesn't have a point; but I think that director Lauren Greenfield paints a honest portrait of women with eating disorders which raises awareness of these terrible diseases--and that's quite valuable.

Thin is a fine documentary that will appeal to many people who have a loved one or friend with an eating disorder; people with eating disorders themselves may also want to see this documentary. I also recommend Thin for anyone studying eating disorders particularly in women.",1357862400,6,3449,4.819256756756757

The success rates for patients are depressingly low.

The filmmakers introduce several women who are undergoing treatment. The women often break rules, lie, and have conflicts with staff. These scenes  - while interesting - can make Thin seem like a soap opera or a reality show.

Viewers also learn about how central insurance is to treatment. Many times, a woman makes progress in treatment, but has to be discharged when her insurance will no longer pay.

2635935,2,B000HEVZA8,"This documentary focuses more on the ridiculously bureaucratic and rule-driven ""treatment"" facilities that are available to those suffering from eating disorders than the eating disorders themselves. I think this was a deliberate choice of focus on the part of the director: she shows that what these women are attempting to get from their disorders is control, and yet, in a bitterly ironic twist, the only treatment options that have been devised by allegedly brilliant ""experts"" are ones which infantilize and control them (i.e. setting up room searches, dining room rules, childish counseling, no tattooing allowed, no smoking, petty talking behind patients' backs on the part of staff, no clique formations etc.) These treatments do NOT work, as is evinced by the lousy success rate--so are they harming the clients more than they are helping them? Is this the best psychology can come up with? I think the questions raised by the film should trouble the sleep of those treating eating disorders. Clearly, they as yet still do not understand the disorder. In the case of the facility featured in ""Thin,"" they are approaching the clients as if starvation/purging were a rational CHOICE rather than a complex disease that affects cognition itself.

This ""documentary"" focuses way too much on the superficial drama within the clinic and only reinforces certain stereotypes due to its lack of depth.  The eating-disorder itself, with all of its pervasive and sinister, deeply felt psychache is left undisclosed, unexamined.  They should re-title this film ""Frew Crew"" and air it in portions as a soap opera on daytime television, or as an MTV reality show.  At least it's amusing.  At least it exposes the interior of an inpatient facility - something the public is rarely privileged or cursed enough to see.  Given the context of a society that loves to intrude and is greatly amused by the suffering of other human beings it is no wonder that ""Thin"" is so shallow.

2635940,5,B000HEVZA8,"I look at Greenfield's THIN as an attempt to solve the problem of telling a story around an emotional topic that is bound to get pelted by criticisms from both sides.

Inevitably, the film will suffer from criticisms that are bound to the reality of eating disorders, not to how a documentary was put together.

I was originally interested in the topic when I started watching, but the craft of storytelling soon took over.  It's as if the moviemakers are sleuths who are simultaneously trying to solve the mystery of ""why"" alongside the mystery of ""who.""

I found the light touch of THIN a necessary approach: it does not try to answer either questions: it allows the camera to roll as tidbits and revelations surface while others stay submerged.  An expert moment arrives when the therapist asks Shelly what lurks in the recesses of her past, possibly making her do what she does.  She says, ""if I'm not telling anyone, why should I tell you?""  And our voyeuristic view gets cut into the next segment, deprived of an answer we may unfairly proceed to apply to other cases later on.

The use of the blue rolling luggage cage (as each patient leaves the center) is poetically angled for each departing outpatient as well.  Some leave pushing a big load, while others leave with nothing but bags they carry by hand.

I also appreciated the light use of background music as a way to refrain from playing with a viewer's emotions.  I only wished that some of the other members at Renfrew (apart from the main four) were introduced earlier, because by the time situations come to a head, and they speak up, I was left to wonder, ""where were these articulate people earlier on?""

If you are looking for a documentary that gives you the answers, you won't find it here, but I've always believe that the best documentaries show you the problem, and leave you to seek out the answers.",1231286400,4,1876,4.634441087613293

But he convinced me to give it a chance, for this documentary does not portray the goodness of the treatment. And he was right. The program does work. It might take more time for some people , but it works. While I was there, I also learned that they had follow this girl for the documentary, but they didn't put her on it... she did overcome her eating disorder.

This dvd is good for educating parents and friends of people with eating disorder so they can understand them better. But never for someone with an eating disorder because it may be triggering for them (believe me... I know).

2635965,5,B000HEVZA8,"As a sufferer of an eating disorder for almost four years now, I would like to applaud Lauren Greenfield for making this extremely moving, heartbreaking documentary that shows the true, dark side of eating disorders. There are all sorts of documentaries and informational videos on eating disorders out there, but none of them compare to this one. I've found that a majority of them merely just give facts about eating disorders, and don't go so deep as to show all aspects of what its like to have one. This documentary brought me to tears, just from seeing the previews alone.  And with other documentaries, I've found that many of them might be very triggering to people with this disease, while this one makes you realize why you want to stop with the destructive behaviors and makes you crave a healthy, happy life. Another good thing about this documentary is the fact that it not only shows extremely thin women, but women of average sizes and above. That just goes to show that people who have eating disorders aren't always necessarily emaciated, but are still in just as much danger.

The documentary goes inside of Renfrew, a Florida treatment facility, showing a variety of different women, but mainly focuses on four different women, struggling for recovery in hopes of living a normal life.

Shelly, polly, brittany, and alisa are the main focuses of this documentary, all with a variety of eating disorders, and all with a variety of different backgrounds that helped to contribute to their eating disorders.

This is a very powerful, heartwrenching, in-depth documentary that takes you into the minds of the women and their daily struggles in the clinic as they fight for recovery.

This film had me in tears from the moment it started, to the last minute when the end credits started rolling. I could see different aspects of myself in each of the women shown, but the fact that they participated and showed their daily struggles to the world gave me hope for my own recovery. This documentary paints an unpretty, totally true pictures of what its like to be in the devastating cycle of an eating disorder.

The ending is probably the most powerful part of the documentary, as it gives you information about what went on with the women after leaving Renfrew, showing that all of them relapsed, and were still struggling with their disease. That is the sad, unfortunate part of the disorder, that it doesn't just go away with the snap of your fingers. I also feel that was the most important part because it shows people just how serious the disease is.

I also wanted to extend my sorrow about Polly, who took her own life a few months back. Even though I didn't know her, I felt like I got to know her after having seen this documentary so many times, and she was truly an inspiration to me and a variety of other people in the eating disorder community. At the very least, as unfortunate as this is, I am happy to know that she is finally at peace and will no longer have to struggle. Despite her being gone, she still continues to inspire me each and everyday.

Final words- watch this documentary, whether or not you have an eating disorder because I feel more people need to be aware of the extremely misunderstood world of eating disorders. And be sure to also check out the THIN book, which gives you a glimpse into the womens lives after the cameras stopped rolling.",1212883200,11,3391,4.6873949579831935

But the film takes what looks to me like an uncompromising look at the issues these women face. They may not be issues to me or you, but they definitely are to the four women.

There are a few stories that have girls resolving to never go back to the destructive habits. But this disease will always be in the back of their minds.

I'm a great admirer of Lauren Greenfield's work.  She created this film.  It's important to note that there is no ""narrator"" in this documentary.  The comments and dialogue only come from the people at the eating disorder clinic, with some onscreen text providing additional information.  Lauren does not try to shape and frame the issues through only her view.  She lets her cameras do their own talking.

If you are dealing with someone with an eating disorder, watch this film.  Read books and professional opinions on the topics.  Study books on related psychological discussions.  Read books by Caroline Knapp - to view the first person introspections of a woman with eating disorders and likely related thinking distortions.  Educate yourself, because there is hope in education.  Thank you to Lauren Greenfield for taking the time and making the priority to use her extraordinary artistic gifts to give more visibility to these important issues.",1182470400,4,1216,5.096446700507614
2635985,5,B000HEVZA8,"I definitely agree that this documentary is limited in it's portrayal of the ""reality"" of eating disorders and treatment.  For several reasons, this still isn't the ULTIMATE look into the lives of eating disordered patients, though it's the best to date.  Patients do die as a result of eating disorders, 7%-10%, a fact that is not made out as a very serious in this film, any one of the women portrayed were on the brink when they arrived.  You lose the fact that most eating disorder patients, patients with symptoms as serious as those of Shelly and even those with less serious symptoms, spend their ENTIRE LIVES fighting. Spending years in many different types of treatment, being treated, inside & outside residential treatment centers, as if they should ""just eat"" because family members and friends don't understand. As frustrated as those around us can get, understanding the thinking seems to be harder than most any other ""mental"" illness, because why can't we ""just eat?""  I think this film does a good job of portraying how nurses and other personnel act towards patients, and how patients, both inside and outside of treatment, feel that they are not only misunderstood, but basically treated as though our illnesses are just a burden, so ""get over it"" so to speak, when in fact it is MUCH more complicated.

The only other thing left out of this movie is the fact that men can also have eating disorders and that there are treatment centers out there that are for males AND females, though many are just for females.  From my viewpoint, the film also shows the importance of small 6-8 patient residential treatment centers since at least three of the four patients left too abruptly and returned to their disordered behavior immediately after leaving treatment.  Such a large group as The Renfrew Center allows ""cliques"" to form, rivalries, and lack of trust which is a major source treatment failure because patients won't open up to one another.  In regards to the facility in this film, the life of a patient is also limited, whereas other treatment centers with fewer patients find help not just through talking & eating together, but through learning how to be comfortable with everyday tasks like grocery shopping, eating at restaurants, finding hobbies that bring them joy, and many other ""outings"" to treat the whole person and prepare them for a completely new (and hopefully improved) life without an eating disorder.

The description above ""Thin offers hope, but no happily-ever-after ending for these women"" is truely the lesson of the disorder and of this film.  Like alcoholism, you never truely ""recover,"" but if you are one of the lucky ones, you can reach a state of constantly being ""in recovery,"" always with starvation and purging in the back of your mind.

Insurance companies today have somehow moved up in rank over our doctors, telling us when we're well, what medications we can take, and what treatments will work, despite the fact that they don't know us, don't have medical degrees, and don't know anything about anything.  The statement made ""People treat it like a cold, but it's more like cancer"" is not only how PEOPLE treat eating disorders, but how INSURANCE treats them.  This film should stand as a testament to all eating disorders who are still struggling due to insurance companies who WON'T LET US GET HELP.",1181260800,29,3362,4.908289241622575

2635990,5,B000HEVZA8,"As someone recovering from an eating disorder, I have noticed that there is a continuing problem with much of the eating disorder literature and media available today; while it effectively serves as an educational tool for those trying to understand the dark world of eating disorders, it can often serve as a trigger for those trying to recover from an eating disorder.  However I have found that Lauren Greenfield's work, both on her Thin documentary and book, does not do this.  In fact, Greenfield's work is the first piece of information on eating disorders that has truly repulsed me from the very condition of having an eating disorder.  This is the first time I have ever felt this way, and that is very significant, because the difficult part of breaking away from disordered eating is actually seeing that it is a repulsive act.

For this reason, I highly recommend both the book and the documentary for those who actively want to recover, and need inspiration, and to those who are having a difficult time understanding why a friend or loved one is going through it.  Greenfield pulls no punches and does not sugar coat any aspect of the girls recovering at the Renfrew Center in Florida (to my knowledge there are no males shown at this facility when the filming occurs, despite the fact that there are men with eating disorders too) Be warned the footage is graphic - there is a lot of vulgar language, views of these women throwing up (one even literally tosses her small dog out of the bathroom, then locks the dog in a crate just so she can have privacy while she vomits), and both the book and the DVD show women's scarred bodies both from self-mutilation and from suicide attempts.

All in all, I am very impressed with Greenfield's work.  Well done.",1168992000,49,1768,4.702265372168285
2635991,4,B000HEVZA8,"About 9 years ago, I was a patient at Renfrew for 2 1/2 months.  The program was different then than it is now however it was what I needed at the time.  When I myself go into treatment, I do not focus on ""cure"" or ""recovery"" because these are only definable by the struggling individual.  Probably the greatest thing I got at Renfrew was the idea of self-empowerment.  I was able to turn my fight with the staff and use it to fuel my fight with my ED.

I think the film made clear how incredibly hard it is to deal with treatment and insurance.  Studies have shown a little bit of treatment can by worse than no treatment at all.  The USA Health Care really needs to reassess how they decide to fund treatment.

However, one thing about the film was very disturbing.  Some of the scenes were of the staff talking about the patients and hte vitriol, lack of empathy, and in some ways, lack of understanding were quite clear and I have to ask how such attitudes might ultimately affect everyone.  At one point, one of the staff says ""[She] is a bad seed.""  I mean that

s not a helpful comment and is as if the staff has lost the ability to seperate the ED from the person, which is essential if help is to be effective.

I would urge others with ED who watch this film to remember EVERYONE's treatment is different.  Just because something happens to one of the girls being followed does NOT mean it will happen the anyone else.",1168992000,18,1428,4.299625468164794
2635992,5,B000HEVZA8,"""If it takes dying to get there, then so be it. At least I'll get there"". That is what Alisa said and it is the perfect phrase that shows how extreme the thinking of an eating disordered person can be.

Watching the video made me realize how ridiculous making thinness the top priority of my life is. But some of the girls were so successful with their weight loss and their indifference to the consequences that I thought since I've been at it so long maybe dying from it wouldn't be so bad. Maybe it would be the biggest accomplishment I've ever achieved.",1166832000,5,557,4.407766990291262
2635993,5,B000HEVZA8,"Having struggled with my own eating disorder for nearly 17 years now, I was drawn to this show primarily out of curiosity. I recently spent 6 mo. at a treatment center, and wanted to see what the Renfrew Center was like in comparison.

This video gives a highly accurate portrayal of what it's really like to have an ED, and spend time in treatment, away from friends and family. The friendships formed, do in fact develop on such deep, intense levels. I commend Lauren Greenfield et. al. for opening the curtains on this disease, and showing the reality of it-- but in a tsteful manner (no pun intended). It was like watching a film of my own time in treatment.

So many magazines out there glamourizes and/or sensationalizes eating disorders. This movie does neither, but rather shows the destructive nature, both mentally and physically. It's NOT just a group of thin girls talking about wanting to be smaller. A perfect tool for classroom discussion, or for family and friends of those with an eating disorder.

You will not be disappointed.

8139062,4,B000HEVZA8,"This is a very intimate and well done look at a very complex disease. I have worked in mental health wards during my college and early post-college years as a psychiatric technician, case worker, utilization reviewer, and finally a family therapist and aftercare planner.

This facility is ran in the same manner as nearly all facilities I've worked in. I'd say that this is an accurate portrayal of inpatient psychiatric care in the United States and of residential treatment centers (for those who are not rich and famous and who cannot pay upwards of $5,000 per day). What is especially difficult is that a treatment center like this is probably close to $800-$1000 per day. So, when these ladies talk about insurance (and how insurance dictates their treatment) it is fully accurate. Facilities like this also don't treat those who are unable to pay, and I remember at least 85% of my clients being sent home within one day of their insurance benefits running out as long as they did not have suicidal or homicidal thoughts. There was so much pressure to stretch the truth during utilization review because you know the client is not ready to go home, but of course you can only do that so much and you certainly don't want to abuse it and cause a fraud investigation.

The staff are not paid well, the facility is not well maintained, and I'd guess that 100% of staff are completely burned out due to lack of ample vacation time and support from their peers and superiors. Imagine having difficult conversations with parents and clients (like that had with Polly) daily, begging you to keep them in the unit even though their presence is truly detrimental to the rest of the unit and is causing so many issues. Who do you choose? These are not easy decisions to make and at the end of the day, you take all of this home with you as a staff member. You are never 'off work' or 'on vacation'.

Anyway--I'm not totally defending the staff or the facility. I'm just saying that this is standard care and honestly any better would be astronomically expensive under our current health care system of over priced treatments and medications. I suppose it is possible to get more supportive staff (and honestly, I was surprised to see so many heavy staff in a facility that treats purely eating disorder clients, as I'd think that would cause a lot of issues between the staff and the client by its very nature).

I personally feel the staff were appropriate, with the exception of the nutritionist who I guarantee I would not get along with and who does not have the best interest of her patients at heart, and I also get the point of having the entire treatment team present at meetings but with so many of them it feels like the client is being ganged up on. I'd probably have no more than 2 or 3 specialist per client present so it is less overwhelming.

 It is also likely that many of these girls have dual diagnosis about which we know nothing (personality disorders, depression, drug addictions) and so the reason for so many of the rules is to prevent self-harming behaviors and/or harming of others, overdose, and death. If the facility did not operate with these rules and something did happen, they would be sued for not keeping the clients safe. The point is not to infantalize them, although to non specialists it seems that way.

However, this type of setting almost never works for recovery of any disorder because it in no way mimics a normal adult life. Who gets up at 5:30 in the morning? I don't, and I have to be at work at 8:00 every day. Who goes to bed at 8:00 at night as an adult? I couldn't. And, if you can't sleep, they just give you a sleeping medication which is also not healthy or realistic.

 Who has dinner every day at 4:00 or snack at 2:30 or breakfast at 7:00? Or eats gross American cupcakes for their birthday (I hate how sweet American cake is. I think this is especially true of those who eat very little processed sugar, so certainly the clients in this facility would be overwhelmed by the sweetness of it).  Who only smokes 6 cigarettes per day IF you exhibit good behavior and make it to level 3.

Insurance requires that treatment centers are set up like this in order to pay for treatment, but the fact is that this treatment and this modality are horrific for recovery and simply serve to 'control' the disease in the current setting. It's very sad to me, as a former health care professional, that this treatment is still standard.

The reason I got out of the mental health field is because I simply cared too much. From the ages of 20-26 I poured myself into this type of work and ended up with adrenal fatigue and exhaustion from worrying about my clients so much. There is a certain hardness one must posses to live with this every day. I think this documentary certainly does a great job of showing what a treatment facility is like, the complexity of treatment, and the fact that most with this or other addictions/disorders struggle with a desire to truly get better, even if they know it's what they should want. Great documentary and excellent insight into this disorder. I wish others who have the power to make decisions would also realize that no matter the intentions behind the facility it is never going to be an effective treatment.",1525737600,,5294,4.578669482576558

This documentary is an AUTHENTIC look inside eating disorders. One thing some people do not understand is that if you are part of the staff, you have to be strong because the diseases that fall under the eating disorder category are tough, mental disorders that effect the body. It's not just about making someone eat. It's easy to criticize the staff if you've never worked in that capacity.

8139064,3,B000HEVZA8,"This film was ok only to the extent that we see real people and their eating disorder and you see the people running the program. What I saw in this film were people with no real life goals (big or small) or desire to add to the world in which they live. So, the Eating Disorder gets the best of them. The program and the people who run it seem robotic so I think the hiring process for such a program is a complete failure. The only raw talent for human touch I saw was the African American lady nurse / care assistant. The rest were not an inspiration for these patients to improve their outlook in life. Seriously.",1523059200,,617,4.19327731092437
8139065,4,B000HEVZA8,"I am a 39 year old woman struggling with Bulimia since age 18. I have finally committed to recovery about 6 months ago, with slips along the way. I was hospitalized at Renfrew in PA at the age of 21 for about 3-4 weeks and attended the outpatient program for about 4 months. Not much has changed as it seems the same program exists and the same dynamics between the women. This was a very accurate description of eating disorders. My issue with this film is that it does not offer a shred of hope. As someone just starting recovery after a lifetime of misery I need hope. Of course I need reasons to stay in recovery, which this film offered in multitude. All the horror stories of ED. But how about one happy ending.",1522540800,2,717,4.318518518518519
8139066,5,B000HEVZA8,"I thought it was a well done documentary and a good look at the mindset what it is like to have an ED....and like some other reviewers, I was appalled at the food that they fed them in there. definelty not a good way to get women interested with food and happy to eat again, by serving up disgusting looking rubbish. Gross looking pizza, overcooked veggies with starches, cheap looking burgers and that cupcake looked the worst. Where's the organic, farm fresh stuff? I wouldn't want to eat in that place, and I currently have a healthy relationship to food. I was also really disappointed with the staff, and them ganging up on polly and kicking her out. I'm glad I was never put in one of those centers, I might of lost my mind. Also, an amazing book that changed my life, 'brain over binge' about neuroplasticity, working with your brain to create new habits around food. it talks a lot about how ineffective regular treatments are for ED. it's on amazon. life changing, if you are in that boat.",1521504000,,998,4.519337016574585
8139067,2,B000HEVZA8,"As a former inpatient at the same Renfrew treatment center, it was tough to watch. It stirred up a lot of emotions I hadn't felt in the 14 years since I had been there and it brought back a lot of memories (good and bad) that I haven't spent much time thinking about since. I wasn't thrilled with the documentary- it did a terrible job at capturing how intensive the treatment process is at Renfrew and, instead, decided to focus on the juvenile-type drama created by a few inpatients. It also did a terrible job at portraying the staff and failed to show how involved they really are with their patients and the patients' individual treatment programs. I was a junior in high school, on the brink of death, when my parents admitted me, kicking and screaming, to Renfrew. Initially, I resented my parents for forcing me to go and I hated being there- I had no intention, nor the desire, to recover. Now, I thank God every day for Renfrew, for the treatment I received while there, and for the staff who was there for me along the way- all of which, literally saved my life.",1521158400,,1073,4.451776649746193
8139068,5,B000HEVZA8,"This documentary just shows how real a eating disorder is. People unaffected by it should really watch, it gives a real perspective on their daily struggles.",1518220800,,157,5.076923076923077
8139069,2,B000HEVZA8,"Boring documentary featuring women struggling with anorexia.  The first irony was that at least half of the staff was obese.  How about another documentary highlighting their eating disorders?  Interesting that they were trying to help others with the same problem, except under-eating rather than over-eating which is socially acceptable.  (and often encouraged)  Then there were the clock, name plaque, etc. all promotional items from various drug companies.  The two I remember were Zoloft and Prozac.  Big pharma is lucrative business for all involved.  I'm sure the staff meant well, but I didn't see anyone who was at a professional level that would be required to effectively treat such severe psychological problems.  I see on the internet that this place has several locations.  There is a lot to be said, but I'll leave it at that.  Some things that are broken are just not fixable.  It's that simple.",1517875200,,911,5.122448979591836
