4386757,5,B004IK30RI,Gave it for a Christmas gift and my daughter loves it. She did not know that there were so many Brady movies.,1325980800,,109,4.0
4386758,5,B004IK30RI,"I received this product in a timely manner and it was in great condition, I am very satisfied. Great picture seems like new.",1317945600,,124,4.434782608695652
4386759,5,B004IK30RI,"This is a super cool 4-disc set of 4 of the grooviest movies ever made. Each disc includes a color silkscreen picture on it. No special features are included though and these are the exact same discs that come with the standalone releases. Discs are packaged in a lenticular slipcase (see pictures of everything I scanned, labled and posted).

Below are the 4 movies/4 discs included:

The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) feature film
rated: PG-13, 88 mins., widescreen format

A Very Brady Sequel (1996) feature film
rated: PG-13, 89 mins., widescreen format

The Brady Bunch in the White House (2002) TV movie
rated: PG-13, 88 mins., fullscreen format

Growing Up Brady (2000) TV movie
rated: PG-13, 88 mins., fullscreen format

My favorite movie from this set is ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and coming in at a close second is ""A Very Brady Sequel"". These movies are very sharp and pure satire, no BB fan can watch them without laughing at the ludicrousness. The other 2 movies aren't as strong as the proceeding ones, but they're still excellent and at this price I can't really complain.

Like the BB Shag Carpet boxed set, this is also made in Mexico and distributed by Paramount. (Note to Paramount: please consider putting out the complete series of ""The Brady Brides"", as well as the 1990 ""The Bradys"" as I'm sure you know many fans would desperately like to watch these hilarious shows again.)

If you have any interest in ""The Brady Bunch"" I say get this set because chances are it will become a collector's item (not at all unlike the 1-disc ""Brady Bunch Variety Hour"" DVD). This is just so much fun to watch and something you can be proud to share with your friends because who doesn't love the Bradys.

Mr. Sherwood Schwartz (may he rest in peace) created ""The Brady Bunch"" more than 40 years ago. And since then an entire world inspired by this classic has been reinvented countless times over the decades. As a lifelong BB fan, to me, what makes ""The Brady Bunch"" so lasting is that it's more than just a sitcom; it's a family that transcends time and culture. We can relate to them because we grew up watching them.",1311552000,11,2120,4.647058823529412
4386760,4,B004IK30RI,"For the price, this is one amazing set. Even if the first two films were the only ones included, I would say it would definitely be worth getting. However, we get four films, which is great for fans of the original series, and the movie series spoofing it!

The first two films in the set, The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel are astounding. They're truly the pinnacle of satire. Everything from direct references, to cameos, to racy innuendos are all here, and it's perfect for fans and non-fans alike. The humor is brilliant, and I can't tell you how many times I've watched these on VHS. I am happy to now own them on DVD.

The next film is a bit of a let down. It's a direct to TV sequel to the previous films, and while Shelley Long and Gary Cole return as the founding Bradys, the kids are recast. This is a huge let down for those who have seen the original two, specifically for the lack of Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan Brady, who was one of the biggest successes of the original theatricals. Overall, this one just isn't as clever or funny as the first two.

Why Growing Up Brady is in this set, I can't begin to tell you. It feels noticeably out of place amongst the satires in the set. The biopic itself is someone enjoyable, but nothing to get excited about.

All in all, other than a strange product description, this a great set to own, even just for 2 of the 4 films!",1301788800,20,1389,4.25
4386761,4,B004IK30RI,"Okay, so right now, you're probably wondering what exactly is in this set. While Amazon might have listed it as a flashback to the 50's, this is not the TV movies of the 70's and 80's. What you get here is the films of the 90's that spoofed the series, as well as Growing Up Brady, the TV movie that showed the behind the scenes of the show everyone knows and loves from Barry William's perspective. For those OC fans out there, the film features a young Adam Brody (pre-OC) in the role of Barry. While not the greatest movie, it's still an enjoyable view. I have been a huge fan of the first two Brady Bunch satire films, The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel for a long time. True, they're kind of awful, but that's the point. They're hilarious, and they achieve all that they set out to do. The two theatrical movies are in widescreen, while The Brady Bunch in the White House and Growing Up Brady are both in fullscreen. I still haven't watched The Brady Bunch in the White House. But Gary Cole and Shelley Long reprise their roles of Mr. and Mrs. Brady, so I'm sure it's still a good time. For the price, this set is a great deal, and these films are a hoot!",1301702400,23,1171,4.232142857142857
4386762,1,B004IK30RI,This movie was really upsetting!  It was nothing like the series.  And some of the language my goodness!!  I would never let my kids watch this.  This was a real disappointment!,1379548800,,177,4.612903225806452
4386763,5,B004IK30RI,"This set originally sold for $14.95, which was so cheap! Unfortunately, it's out of print, so if you can snag a copy like I did on Amazon's Marketplace, you're in for a real treat. The first two Brady movies are wonderfully satirical and sharp. To me, they are the Brady Bunch for Adults, whereas the original TV series is great for kids. I also caught ""Growing Up Brady"" on TV, so I'm pleased to get this on DVD. It is a made-for-TV movie that is based on Barry Williams' book of the same name. You get to see the back story told from Barry's point of view, about the show and its cast members. I have to admit being disappointed that the original group of kids from the movies weren't used for ""Brady Bunch In the White House""; even Alice was cast with a different actress. It's a cute movie, but I still prefer the first two Brady films. Overall, a nice set of Brady films that will keep you entertained for hours.",1375056000,,917,4.30635838150289
4386764,5,B004IK30RI,"If you like silly, campy comedy - this is for you - especially if you grew up watching the original show.  The actors picked for the movie and the sequel were outstanding.  The 3rd movie (White House) not as great of a line up (kids different - Carol and Mike same) and not as good as the first 2.  Still a great set of movies for the price.",1368403200,,341,3.985294117647059
4386765,5,B004IK30RI,I grew up with Brady Family in the 70's.  I thought the Brady Movie Series was a great tribute to the TV Series.  I thought the whole movie cast did a great job with the characters.,1366588800,,181,4.0
4386766,4,B004IK30RI,This movie was so fun when I went to see it at the theater about 20 years ago. It was still fun to watch. I grew up on the Brady bunch and it incorporated a lot of then with the now!,1365984000,,182,3.4634146341463414
4386767,5,B004IK30RI,"Fun, hillarious and well made. THis is a must have for anyone 40 years old and older who enjoyed the original series.",1363219200,,117,4.363636363636363
4386768,5,B004IK30RI,"I was looking for A Very Brady Sequel when I found this. It was about the same price as Sequel alone (from the marketplace). I already own The Brady Bunch Movie (and love it!) and decided to go for this since I didn't have The Brady Bunch In The White House or Growing Up Brady. I found Sequel to be as good as The Brady Bunch Movie- very funny. The BB in the White House was not as good, imho, as the other two. Despite having Gary Cole and Shelly Long return as Mike and Carol Brady, a weak script makes this movie struggle for laughs. The actors playing the kids do a good job, but again the poor storyline makes it hard for them to really show their talent. All in all worth a watch, but not as good as The Brady Bunch Movie or A Very Brady Sequel. This brings us to Growing Up Brady, based on Barry William's (the original Greg Brady) best selling book of the same name. This is very different from the other three movies, showing what it was like behind the scenes of the original Brady tv series from Barry's point of view. Insightful, well written and good acting make Growing Up Brady a must see for any fan of the original series.",1362355200,,1140,4.1863636363636365

4386770,4,B004IK30RI,"Unlike most late baby boomers, I'm not reluctant to admit I am a lifelong Brady fan.  The spoofs have many good moments if you are a fan.  If you are not, you probably won't be interested in these films.  The jokes about Jan (always my favorite) and her Marcia obsession, lousy eye site, and raven haired wig are the strengths of the spoof films.  Where these films fail is with the original content.  The Brady Bunch Movie is easily the best of the three spoofs but, falls down with too much slapstick from Michael McKean (whom I love in Spinal Tap) and the other non-Brady characters.  As for Growing up Brady, I found it interesting but, was disappointed that the movie ends when The Brady Bunch ended it's original run.  The typecasting problems the actors faced as the show continued in syndication is only lightly dealt with.  The packaging is fine with me and about what I expected.  No complaints about the discs themselves.  In summary, I'm glad I have this package but, am reluctant to put the ""must see"" tag on them for Brady fans.",1357603200,,1042,4.553763440860215

4386774,5,B004IK30RI,"The Brady Bunch movies, that came out in the 90's, were interesting to me.

The first set up the concept of the Brady family being stuck in a time warp and still trying to be themselves. Whoever thought of that idea had a great one in my book.

This movie is not simply a movie for kids. No. Some of the jokes are...as the first disc of the set say, racy humor. Many of them will go over the kids heads watching but still...watch it with them the first time.",1354406400,,458,4.0777777777777775

8430750,3,B004IK30RI,"Parody done right by people who know and love the series. The 'Brady Bunch' was never my favorite show included in the Nick-at-Nite block of programming that I watched obsessively, but I saw enough episodes to appreciate 'The Brady Bunch Movie' and 'A Very Brady Sequel.' I bought this collection because (at the time) it was the only way to get those 2 films. I can't speak to Brady Bunch in the White House (different cast, and looked dumb so I never watched), and I think I saw the 'Growing Up Brady' flick on Lifetime at some point? Not great, and didn't really tell me anything new that E! True Hollywood stories omitted (remember that show? They should bring that back).

I gave this 3 stars because of the unnecessary inclusion of the 2 other films and the fact that the set has gone up in price and the 2 films you actually want are available for individual purchase.",1435708800,,875,4.50314465408805

8430756,1,B004IK30RI,Its a shame the real Brady Bunch movies like The Brady Girls Gets Married didn't come out like this instead of in the TV series complete box set. (even if Brady Girls not included in that set.)  I'm sorry but they should call this a goofy films rather than a groovy films.  While goofy worked for stuff like Get Smart  it doesn't work with most of the 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that Hollywood been making in movies like these. I would much prefer it if the actors took their Brady character roles seriously rather than being made cheesy on purpose. The first one was bad enough but each of these movies like the Brady Sequel spoof on the show Hawaii trip just got worst with each one made.,1393113600,,687,4.3515625
