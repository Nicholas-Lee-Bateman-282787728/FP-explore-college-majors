2628839,1,B000H5TVK8,"This is possibly one of the worst movies ever done. Where to begin with all it's flaws?  There are movies that are so poor they are fun and entertaining right down from the dialogue to the acting, then there's the films, like this one, that's a total bomb.

The acting is very poor. The main character, Isabelle, is fairly good, but the rest over act. Especially the father.

There is no character developement. Just suddenly, here is my character, and here in my secret. And eveyone one in this film has a dirty secret.

The writing is very poor. Characters suddenly switch actions in mid sentence. There are logical mistakes galore. At onle point, the demon knocks out the phone line when the priest is calling the bishop. He says to the mother that the phone is dead, he will have to go into town to speak to the bishop, he will call her with the details of the meeting. OK>..if the phone is dead...how? And if he's going to call by cell phone, why not use the cell and call the bishop?

Avoid.........",1179014400,11,1005,4.440217391304348
2628840,1,B000H5TVK8,"Strait to the point. It sucks big time. All the actors in it are totally bad. Such bad performances that it should win at the razzies for worst ensamble cast in a film. Also it should stick around at the ceremony because it will sweep up worst screenplay,director,production,makeup etc etc. Look i know its a low budget production but come on. There`s low budget and then there is no budget. My advise is remake it with good actors and a good director. Have the script worked on by a real writer and find a real producer and then it could have been up there with the excorcist and emily rose. Ps,the guy who played the father and the guy who played the priest should quit acting all together. There is bad acting and then there is no acting. Rediculous.",1174176000,2,753,4.424460431654676

2628842,2,B000H5TVK8,"This lowbudget ripoff of EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE fails on many counts:  it's acting is mediocre, with even the usually reliable Cameron Daddo not up to snuff; the effects are minimal and shoddy; the pacing is slow, and it just doesn't have enough real scares.  The subplot of the priest's romance with the possessed girl's sister is also dead weight.  Although supposedly based on true events and with the sanction of the Catholic Church, the movie is just a direct to DVD timepasser.",1172448000,,483,4.795180722891566
2628843,2,B000H5TVK8,"A best, Blackwater Valley Exorcist is a formula movie, yet another direct to DVD movie riding on the coattails of Exorcist and the Exorcism of Emily Rose. Don't get me wrong, this movie does have its good points and fun moments, but nothing at all spectacular.

It has all the components necessary for a formula exorcism movie: the flawed family, the fallen Priest, the young possessed daughter. It uses all these pieces much the same way so many other movies of its type have. There are a few unexpected elements, such as just how flawed the townspeople really are, and a some love subplots that are slightly irregular, but nothing out of the ordinary to make you take notice. The same is true of the special effects. The standard pale skin, chapped lips, white eyes, and Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-vampire make-up are used. Nothing that is scary or new in the special effects.

The worst flaw in this movie is the ending. It looks like the writer didn't know how to end it at all, so they cobbled something together that wouldn't satisfy an English 101 professor. At the end, you're wondering, ok.... So what?

There are better movies out there that deserve your time and money far more than this. If you want an exorcism movie you can't do better than the original Exorcist. If you're bored of that, try Exorcist the Beginning, which for a B movie was pretty good. Emily Rose is so-so, but still a step above Blackwater Valley Exorcism.

Not recommended.",1168819200,10,1455,4.739130434782608

Best Horror Flick I Saw In All Of 2006! 2 Thumbs Up!

The Possessed Girl, Portraid By Kristin Erickson, had

me really believing that this was a real Exorcism!

Can't wait to see more from this production company

and will buy/rent any movie Kristin Erickson stars in!

So far have seen her in two others... American Blend and

a smaller film. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is her best yet!

Can't wait to see what type of role she picks next...

2628846,1,B000H5TVK8,"I really wanted to like this movie when I started to watch it. It turned out that I really didn't like this movie at all. The story was presented in such a bad way that it was very unbelievable. A ranch hand being an ex-priest, the other ranch hand always carring a gun to get his way, the father being an overly jealous husband and father, the non-emotional mother of Isabelle and finally a farm vet that is acting as a medical doctor of the possessed Isabelle. The acting was very poor except for Jacob the ranch hand and for Isabelle the main actress. I understand that the movie was based on a true story, and with respect to the people that were orginally involved, don't waste your money on renting it or purchasing it.",1166832000,4,725,4.377777777777778

2628849,3,B000H5TVK8,"Blackwater Valley Exorcism is, as the name would imply, another entry in the recently ever-expanding exorcism-horror subgenre. Right from the plot summary, I was predicting that this was a ripoff of The Exorcist and, to a point, it is. Sadly, this movie falls very short of that seminal classic. To me, this was one of those movies that seems promising enough within the first half, but by about the 40-minute mark, you can tell they just gave up completely on this film. There were some parts that I found, whether it was the intent of the creators or not (and I'm guessing not), to be quite comical. It also became too close to being a soap opera; there was a seemingly extraneous amount of characters with no satisfying back-story or development. To me, it felt as if they had set up everything for something big and exciting to happen, and then in the end gave up on it. The acting of Kristin Erickson is quite a saving grace, but overall, as far as exorcism-horror films go and horror films of the 00's, this is not a standout in either area.",1365984000,,1047,4.515789473684211
2628850,3,B000H5TVK8,"It is too bad that the old drive-in's that I grew up with are all gone, at least around the area in which I live.  Too bad, because this is the type of movie that would have provided me and my lady a great Friday or Saturday night out.  Is it worthy of a big opening in the theaters of today, no, but I am glad it made it to video.  Is it on par with ""The Exorist?""  No, it most certainly is not.  However, Kristin Erickson (Isabelle) plays her part as a demon filled girl to the max.  She has only been around since 2002, but deserves bigger roles than this.  Cameron Daddo who plays the Priest and can't seem to make up his mind if he wants to be a priest or have normal relations with his old girfriend.  James Russo is probably the best known cast member, but he has a very limited role as The Bishop, so don't expect too  much from him.  The other cast member you may recognize is Jeffrey Combs as the Sheriff.  Again, a rather limited role and one that doesn't add too much, if anything to the movie.  But considering they only had a million dollar budget, they did just OK.  Finally, I don't judge movies by all the mistakes or camera angles or any technical stuff, but I judge by the ""did it entertain me"" factor and yes, Blackwater was good for a rainy Saturday night.  Besides, I got to add it to my B-Movie collection for a very low  price and got it right here on Amazon.",1334534400,,1383,4.108208955223881
2628851,1,B000H5TVK8,"The film was one of the best comedies ever written. Everything in the film was bad from the story to the actors to the props. As a Catholic  priest I have never laughed so hard at such a pitiful film. The ""bishop"" who was an advisor turns out to be a member of a sect in no way affiliated with the Catholic Church. All they needed was a Catholic priest to advise them on correct portrayals though I would never have accepted the job after reading the script. . The  priest praying vested before the altar with candles lit, the wrong color and kinds of vestments, the taping of a wooden cross to the girls had that had only one  pointed edge to stab the ex priest, the silly vestments (a ""surplus"" instead of a ""surplice"") in the wrong color and the homemade surplice for the ex priest we so pointedly wrong and silly that one could only laugh at the attempt to recreate any semblance of authenticity that was a one hundred percent failure. I think a couple of college kids or even teen agers could have done a better job at making such a film. I don't think the DVDS should be even given away free unless you really wanted to punish someone by making them watch it!",1290384000,,1165,4.286363636363636

2628853,2,B000H5TVK8,"Blackwater Valley Exorcism isn't a very good movie, but I'll be danged if it didn't cram more crazy plot twists into it than any exorcism movie I've ever seen.  Every character in this film is so eaten up with his/her own personal demons that it's a wonder a bona fide demon could ever find room to get in and actually possess one of them in the first place.  As we all know, a demon will exploit any guilt and weakness in those who dare attempt to exorcise him; well, this demon is sitting on a mountain of ammunition once the collars start calling.  Some of you are undoubtedly wondering if the film is scary.  Personally, I have never seen anything scary about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-The-Version-You-ve-Never-Seen/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)</a>, but I'm pretty confident in saying Blackwater Valley Exorcism isn't going to scare a living soul the least little bit.  It will make you laugh, but it won't scary you.  As for my fellow Jeffrey Combs fans, you should already be used to Combs making cameo appearances in lousy horror films.  In most cases, he's the only thing the film has going for it.  In this case, however - and I really hate to say this - he turns in a terrible performance.  He was so bad that I didn't even realize it was him at the time.

Blackwater Valley is obviously a hotbed of dysfunctional people.  You would think that poor demon-possessed Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) would be worse off than anyone else, but that is far from the case.  Her father Eli (Randy Colton) is all kinds of surly, carries a grudge like a sledgehammer, and is borderline psychotic with jealousy and suspicion of a wife he probably doesn't even love.  There's Miguel, the farmhand with a hidden past whose diagnosis of Isabelle as possessed pretty much gets the whole exorcism ball rolling.  Then there's the priest (Cameron Daddo), the most-screwed up character of all.  It is most ironic that the family turns to him for help because a previous relationship he had with Isabelle's sister has left plenty of bad blood between him and the family.  Let's just say Father Jacob didn't take a traditional path toward the priesthood.  He also happens to look a lot like Neil Diamond.

Just picture this exorcism party: a priest with a really sordid past who just turned down a chance to study exorcism at the Vatican because he didn't believe in possession; a cowardly Mexican farmhand who repudiated his faith years earlier; Isabelle's sister Claire (Madison Taylor), who is, quite inexplicably, still all hot and bothered over Father Jacob; and a local veterinarian who just proved that a syringe full of horse tranquilizer won't kill a man.  Many a dark secret is revealed before this night is through - heck, you almost forget about poor possessed Isabelle as a full-fledged soap opera erupts inside the house.

I like the story's unconventional twists and turns, as they do distinguish this particular film from the pack of Exorcist clones that have been produced over the years, but the film's mixed bag of surprises just isn't enough offset all of the inane dialogue and hysterically bad acting in the film.  It's impossible to take this film seriously, especially with Randy Colton turning in a performance worthy of the Hayden Christensen bad acting award of the year.  An exorcism movie with very little in the way of dark atmosphere and no capacity for frightening the viewer just isn't going to get the job done.  Blackwater Valley Exorcism is good for a few laughs, but that's about it.",1237680000,3,3623,4.971807628524046
2628854,2,B000H5TVK8,"Talk about bad acting, bad editting, weak lines, and an ending that left me scratching my head, this movie can make the devil take a break from his evil and he would roll over laughing!  If Linda Blair or anyone from The Exorcism of Emily Rose sees this movie, chances are they might demand to get that 90 minutes of their life back.  Someone did not carefully stereotype the acting roles and script lines.  They never showed what really happened to sheriff as he was attacked and few other scenes where left incomplete. I enjoy watching the behind-the-scenes footage that comes on most DVDs and even that was poorly done.  In many segments I could hear the people because they played the background music too loud.  I rented this DVD for $2 and that was a little too steep for a movie of this type.",1204243200,,799,4.482758620689655

2628856,4,B000H5TVK8,"I acutally liked the movie and yes I read all of the other reviews wrtitten about the movie however the point of the story is still true. The movie is similar to that of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, it is a little low budget and maybe the acting and the ending still could of been better. But whether you are chirstian or not, believe in exorcism's or not the point of this story is just how well's one's weakness, strengths and faith are tried and exploited during the time of crisis.

It is interesting how the demon played the entire family not just the girl. It manipulated used everyones weakness, secrets,sins and thoughts againist them, distracted them to the point the didn't trust each other believed things that were untrue and became unfocused on what is really going on. It almost took out the whole family,and let the ""fallen"" preist(s)know just how unclean their hands and heart really is.

Another thing that one needs to know before you buy or rent the movie is that it is based on true, documented events and written and produced by a church. Keep that in mind while you watch the movie.",1179878400,7,1103,4.5376884422110555
