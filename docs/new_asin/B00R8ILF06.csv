6906940,5,B00R8ILF06,"In the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 15, Jesus tells 3 stories to help his listeners understand the amazing love He has for those who were lost. The one we call The Prodigal Son, He tells the story of a Father, filled with love and compassion, who is hoping for the return of his son who has left home and turned his back on the family. The Father longs for the sons return and he runs to meet and embrace him on that happy occasion. He calls for a huge welcome home celebration. Jesus tells us that our Heavenly Father waits for all of his children to return home with hearts turning to Him. Its an amazing story of grace, forgiveness and redemption.
Nathan Clarkson has had a passion for sharing stories that change lives. He wrote the script for a modern-day re-telling of this Bible Story. He raised funding, secured actors, and produced Confessions of a Prodigal Son. Nathan stars in the film opposite Kevin Sorbo as the Father (Hercules, God's Not Dead, Soul Surfer) and Rachael Lee. We follow Sean as he leaves home, goes off to college and explores the wide world. Its a common road that many of us have travelled in the effort to find identity and purpose separate from the world of our parents. Nathan takes us on an exciting adventure with a very satisfying ending. This film will touch your heart and mind. It will also make a great gift. I heartily recommend this film.",1427155200,,1376,4.48605577689243
6906941,3,B00R8ILF06,"Thank you Bender/Helper Impact for sending us a DVD of this movie to review!

Confessions of a Prodigal Son was successfully Kickstarted in the spring of 2013.  The fundraising goal was a meager ten thousand dollars and Nathan Clarkson, the lead actor and project lead, raised $13,835.00 to make it a reality.  While the low budget aspect is hard to hide, the story told is timeliness and teaches about God's love, forgiveness, and redemption.

Many college age kids are tired of being told what to do by their parents.  As a preacher's kid, Sean wanted to escape from his father's (Kevin Sorbo) shadow. Instead of attending a Christian college to become a pastor, he desired to go to a public college and do his own thing.  Sean's parents relented and paid for two years of college and promised to pay the other half if he didn't squander the funds and keep a grade A average.

Getting an A in his English class will be no easy task as his teacher is very strict and not very tolerant of Sean's chronic tardiness.  Sean is going to have to get his partying under control and figure out what he wants in life and what his goals are.  Not only does he need to do this for his own good, but he has to write a paper about his life story.  He still doesn't know what his is, all he does know is that he wants to be free and not told what to do by anyone else.

Unfortunately, I couldn't relate with Sean's character and found him to be more shallow than lost.  Why the drastic rebellion?  There's not much of a back story with him and his parents other than him being a preacher's kid.  Sean's best friend in the movie is a womanizer who doesn't have much going for him other than partying and popping pills.  The most complex character in the movie is Sean's love interest (Rachael Lee) whose dad left her when she was just a toddler and is trying to forgive her father.  She turns to God for strength and encourages Sean to re-consider his relationship with God.

While the story is modernized from the Biblical parable, I feel that it could have been better.  The characters didn't click with me and there were too many holes in the story it was trying to tell.  Even though I'm impressed with what was accomplished with limited funding, I think that it could have benefited from more seasoned writers and acting talent.",1427155200,3,2319,4.439716312056738
6906942,5,B00R8ILF06,"Excellent retelling of the age old story, and written in a way to show the profound love and grace of God. Highly recommend.",1427155200,,124,4.434782608695652
6906943,5,B00R8ILF06,"I received this video for review purposes.  I was not asked to write a review on Amazon, but felt compelled to.  This movie is a low budget Christian film that really did a pretty good job.  Naturally, the acting is not what big Hollywood movies dole out, but it is definitely tolerable (seriously--even better than the new Annie movie).  I loved the powerful messages in this movie.  Sean is a young college student who is figuring out life and doesn't want to be told how to live and does what he wants, all in the pursuit of happiness.  But he doesn't really find happiness and one day, wakes to find he has lost everything.  The story line is one that people can relate to.  When we view our life as a story, powerful changes can take place.  What makes your story worth being told?  We all walk through something and many times live in a broken world that we have created for ourselves.  How will you write the ending to your story?",1427068800,23,937,4.3895348837209305
6906944,5,B00R8ILF06,"I was given a complimentary copy of the movie, Confessions of a Prodigal Son from Business2Blogger.com in exchange for an honest review.

Nathan Clarkson wrote and produced this Christian film and actually was the main character in the movie named Sean.  Sean is the son of a pastor who is played by Kevin Sorbo, from the movie God's Not Dead.  Sean asks for his college funds and then disappears from his parents for two years, and enters the all too scary world of drinking and prescription pills.  He also ends up using his money to buy a car, rent an apartment and live off the money from his parents.  He has a horrible friend who is an enabler and every parent's worst nightmare.  This friend is the one friend that our parents disliked us having growing up or the one that you dislike your children being friends with.

Sean is fighting hard to escape the life he envisions his parents and everyone else wants him to have and in this, he loses himself.  It isn't until he meets a girl that he starts to evaluate where his life is.  He is also prompted by his professor to have the class write the story of their life, where they are the main character and how their decisions can effect their story.

Sean also gets himself into a situation where he literally loses everything and has to get a job.  It is quite similar to the parable in the book of Luke 15: 11-32 in the Bible, where the son asks for his share of the inheritance and then ""squanders his wealth in wild living,"" (Luke 15:13) and is forced to get a job.

Without giving too much of the movie away, Sean finds himself and God, thanks to the love and compassion of not only of his father but others around him.

I thought this movie was excellent, and they did a wonderful job of bringing this parable to real life in today's standards.  I don't think my husband and I would let our three or five year old watch it because of scenes with beer bottles, prescription pills, and some light fight scenes.  It would be a fantastic family movie though for middle schoolers and up to watch with their parents, or even in a youth group.  I didn't catch any profanity, and there is a wholesomeness to the film that makes it age appropriate for the tweens and teenagers to watch.

I am in the midst of Beth Moore's Children of the Day Women's Bible Study, where she says in the video series, ""The number one prayer she gets from her followers is about their adult children and how they are not involved in church.""  Confessions of a Prodigal Son would hit home to several people, including parents who have children of college age like Sean in the movie, or to teens who are about to go into this stage of independent living for the first time in their lives.  It also would hit home to grandparents, or adult children who just got out of this stage of life and are entering into marriage and starting families.

It is important for our youth and children to have their faith firmly rooted.  We need to equip them with the knowledge of the scriptures, but also need them to have that personal relationship with God and know Him.  This movie does an outstanding job of showing what can be out there if  we just go about the motions, and don't commit ourselves to our faith.  It also shows the unconditional love and compassion of a father to his lost son, quite similar to how lost we can be yet have a Father who loves us so much more than we can ever comprehend.

Some of my favorite lines from the movie are.

""Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.""

and

""Live a story worth telling.""",1426982400,56,3564,4.375379939209727

It is a bit of encouragement to a parent that has a son/daughter that has left home in search for ""themselves"" and wants to live a life with ""no rules"" but I doubt you would get the prodigal to watch this movie to the end because they are usually in denial, but if they watched the complete movie it might encourage them that they can go home and their parents really do love them and want the best for them. Good movie for parents who have someone like this. The problem sometimes is they may never come back, this is where prayer helps.

6906972,2,B00R8ILF06,"I usually love most family Christian movies. Also, most of the time i find reviews here to be somewhat accurate. However, this is NOT the case with this movie. This movie was simply horrible. The story and plot were weak and loosely based on the prodigal son from the Bible. The acting was just completely awful. Maybe this is due to two of the main characters in this movie (including the son) being the ones who tried to ""make"" this movie. Why would the main character wear a white undershirt for nearly the entire movie? He even wore this on dates....Ugghhh.

This was a waste of 2 hours and i do not say that lightly. Sorbo was in the movie MAYBE 5 minutes. This was the only bright spot of acting in the whole movie. However, not even a Herculean effort could save this movie from failure. Not sure where all the 4 & 5 star reviews are coming from but there is no way they can be taken seriously.

After he is tossed out of college for pulling a stunt that the dean frowned upon, he returns home.  His father, played by Kevin Sorbo is preaching to his congregation the unconditional love of God when the young man shows up.  Their reunion is very emotionally moving. You will have to watch the movie to find out what happens between the young lady and Sean.

God IS love, but I believe that He does get disappointed when we stray from Him. Most parents would be upset, saddened, and yes, disappointed by their child's rebellion.

6907138,1,B00R8ILF06,"I saw this film hoping I could believe the son. Tragically, the story is not believable. The sons ""fall"" consisted of incidents of under age drinking, a lame declaration into a campus video camera and an overzealous Dean who expels students. Where is the campus police taking him in for drunk and disorderly conduct? Where are the processes that normally would take place when a student is expelled? None of it was realistic. The drunk driving accident was the least believable. Suddenly the leach friend goes looking for the prodigal son, brings him back to his place drunk and injured with zero consequences? I am so disappointed. This film mocks the parable it is based on and in a tragic way it's hubris mocks the bible as well.",1435622400,3,732,4.7265625

6907159,5,B00R8ILF06,"This movie centers around Sean(Nathan Clarkson),a pastor's son,who leaves home to find life's answers on his own. He goes to college,but doesn't take it seriously and that gets him in big trouble. He meets Ali,a young woman seeking answers herself,and befriends her,but his attitude gets in the way of their friendship. He soon realizes that he must return home because the answers he's been seeking were there all along. As he makes his way home,his father(Kevin Sorbo) is speaking to his congregation about God's unconditional love. I have to say that Sorbo packed a very emotional punch with his performance,as limited as it was. The reunion between father & son is very touching. I wholeheartedly recommend that parents & teens watch this together and discuss it afterwards.",1430870400,10,778,5.133858267716535

I can deeply associate with the father in hurting for my kid but Jesus had to let Simon-Peter understand the importance of keeping focused and his eyes on Jesus Christ. Well done!

6907173,4,B00R8ILF06,something the young son said in the movie caught my attention.  He said he was tired of living with rules and that his parents making out the plans of what they wanted him to be.  Possibly hoping that he would become a pastor like his dad.  I believe that's where a lot of rebellion starts in a son or daughter.  Parents need to give their children to the Lord and pray their children will follow Gods plan for their life not the parents.  I was thrilled at the end that it came out alright.,1427328000,,491,4.180851063829787
