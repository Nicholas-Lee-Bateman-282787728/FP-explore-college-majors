8687773,4,B00PGA8OTI,"This 1956 Italian release should not be confused with the 1953 Joan Fontaine vehicle directed by Ida Lupino. IL BIGAMO stars Marcello Mastroianni as a traveling salesman who returns home to his wife and year old son, only to be accused of bigamy by a woman he swears he's never seen before. Vittorio De Sica is his defense counsel, who wants him to plead guilty to ensure a lighter sentence. A long unseen black and white comedy that finally earned a 2014 DVD release from Video Dimensions, in Italian with English subtitles, running 95 minutes.",1467763200,,545,4.747368421052632
