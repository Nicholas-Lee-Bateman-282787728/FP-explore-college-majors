1827913,5,B000087EYI,"ok look. even if i told you these movies [are bad]. even if i said ""these are the worst mst3k episodes i've ever seen."" even if i said that the case fell apart in my hands and ants poured out and ate me alive, you'd still buy it.
youre here because you're an mst3k fan. so stop with the foreplay and go shell out for this one. if you think it costs too much, take the price and divide by 4. thats the amount you're paying for each movie. not too bad.
get it!
oh, and by the way, the guy that said the cases were hard to use... i agree. whatcha gotta do (what worked for me) is you press down the center thingy, and pull up on the upper edge of the dvd. pops right out.

1827914,5,B000087EYI,"Just as with the first MST DVD Collection, someone did a fine job choosing the four discs to include in this collection. ""Pod People"" and ""Cave Dwellers"" are both excellent episodes from Joel Hodgson's tenure on the program and perennial fan favorites. And while ""Angels' Revenge"" (I can't get used to leaving out the apostrophe) is not as remarkable a product of the Mike years, it's still a pretty good show, memorable mainly for the cheesy ""Charlie's Angels"" knock-off it featured. The short-subject films that frequently graced MST episodes were the venue for some of the show's best comedy, and the ""Shorts"" disc brings together examples from seasons three through seven for some seriously good entertainment.
As other reviewers have noted, these DVDs don't include the uncut versions of the movies that were included in the first collection. But that hardly seems to matter. The real MST fan has always been more interested in the host's and the bots' reactions to the films than in the films themselves. And while that may encapsulate some film fans' objections to MST in the first place, it doesn't take away from the greatness of the show or the value of this collection. If you don't already have these episodes on video from Rhino or on your own carefully-hoarded tapes made so long ago -- or, heck, even if you do! -- this is a great set to add to your MST shelf.",1048464000,46,1375,4.7573221757322175
1827915,5,B000087EYI,"I echo the sentiments of an earlier reviewer that this is better than the first box set, which I thought was still great.  My wife doesn't like or dislike MST3K but even she watched a couple of these and laughed out loud a lot.  She also shook her head in amazement a lot as she seemed to mull over how bad a movie can actually be.  And these are some stinkers.
Pod People is a completely pointless endeavor whose saving grace is that most of the time it's too mistie (pun!) to see how bad the plot/set is.  Basically aliens land and kill people but it's really ok because they are just misunderstood.  Crow really rescues this one with his ""McCloud!"" comments.
Cave Dwellers is ferociously bad.  To be honest I'm not sure why they called it Cave Dwellers since no one really spent any time dwelling in caves.  The main guy and his pet mute guy lived in a cave but they leave it early and spend the rest of the time outside.  Whatever.  Anyway Joel and the bots really save this montrosity since viewers would otherwise just sit there wondering why a cheap Conan ripoff character was wearing so much makeup.  The fight scenes are hilariously correographed as well, making the multiple jumping, spinning kicks of Jean-Claude Van Dum seem elegant and realistic.  You can also look forward to reeling in amazement as the director crosses all bounds of taste by having the main character in his medieval-set movie drop bombs on his enemy from a hang-glider.
Angel's Revenge is basically a useless boob-fest from the decade that gave us such hits as ""I will survive"".  A cast of tightly-clad women that are racially-mixed enough to satisfy the creators of Power Rangers goes on a vigilante spree, targeting some drug kingpin.  Tom Sirvo sums this one up when one of the girls rides her motorcycle into a pool because another girl is drowning, saying, ""Yeah I can see why she needed a motorcycle to do that.""
This box-set is the best laugh-for-dollar ratio I have ever seen.",1047081600,7,1968,4.604584527220631
1827916,4,B000087EYI,"This four-disc set of MST3k episodes lacks a few of the extras available on the previous release, but that in no way makes this a lesser product.  While I did miss having the trailers and the uncut versions of the film available on the disc, this is still a worthwhile product, combining three great episodes and one short-film collection.  I love watching MST3k on these DVDs, as I can watch and rewatch, and catch gags and references on the second viewing that I missed the first time around.
Here are some quick comments on each of the discs:
ANGELS REVENGE:  From the moment the disco music powers out of your speakers on the opening DVD menu, you should know exactly what to expect.  This is the story of a cheap Charlie's Angels rip-off that increases the number of angels, but decreases the number of coherent plot points.  Yeah, ponder that for a moment.  Anyway, this is a delightfully awful movie with a surprisingly high number of celebrity cameos, including Jack Palance (as a drug kingpin's right-hand man), Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale (as a disco singer's vaguely sleazy manager), and Jim ""The Millionaire"" Backus (as the head of a right-wing militia).  One wonders what hideous bet was lost on the set of Gillian's Island that forced two of its stars to appear.  One wonders what on Earth the 70's did to Jack Palance to make him decide to star in this.  A multi-ethnic plethora of busty babes rounds out the cast.  Despite the title of the film, none of the Angels get anywhere near top billing.  A middle-aged, male Hollywood executive's idea of what a feminist movie would look like.
CAVE DWELLERS:  This is the sequel to some other lousy film, and the lengthy flashback to that picture in the beginning of this turkey makes it out to be just as painful and bizarre.  The back cover of the DVD Boxed Set doesn't even bother giving a plot summary, because there really isn't one - just some muscled guy wandering through a forest for an hour and a half.  This is a film that would be a really, really painful experience without those soothing fellows down in the corner of the screen.
POD PEOPLE:  This ranks as one of my favorite MST3k episodes.  A movie that's unbelievable goofy combined with the hecklers at their wittiest.  The host segments to this one are a riot, and all directly mock the main feature.  I laughed, I cried, I rewound and laughed and cried some more.  I really think this is one of the sharpest commentaries that the MST3k gang recorded, so this is something not to be missed.
SHORTS, Vol. 1: The short instructional films that the Satellite of Live crew occasionally tackled often resulted in some of their funniest material.  These short features are hilarious enough in their own right, but when they get the MST3k treatment, they're even more painfully funny.  Tom Servo hosts: The Home Economics Story, Junior Rodeo Daredevils, Body Care & Grooming, Cheating, A Date With Your Family, Why Study Industrial Arts? and The Chicken of Tomorrow.  Rest assured that they are indeed as frightening as their names would have you believe.
The small print on the back of the Boxed Set informs us that ""the production elements required to include the films in their original format were not available"".  A pity, since a lot of MST3k films make for hilarity even without the commentary.  But still, this shouldn't come as a major disappointment, since it's Mike/Joel and the 'bots rather than the dubious, cheesy films that make these Boxed Sets must-buys, although I must admit to a very sick desire to see the uncut version of POD PEOPLE.",1045440000,60,3570,4.7117552334943635
1827917,5,B000087EYI,"Both Pod People and Cave Dwellers are classic third season MST3K episodes, and with good reason. The movies take film-making to a new level of ineptness, and the Bots and Joel throw many unforgettably funny comments in the films. The ""Trumpy"" comments can still make me laugh on their own even today. Angel's Revenge isn't quite to the caliber of the other two, but is still fun to watch just to see former TV stars like Jim Backus making themselves look silly.
The Shorts disc contains some of the only exclusive material shot for the Rhino video releases, with Tom Servo 'hosting' the feature. It's a great little bonus, and it was filmed during the second Sci-fi channel season. It's a little disappointing that they couldn't include the original versions of the films here (I wonder what Pod People is like without the MST3K filter...*shudder*). But this still is a excellent set, better than the first, and a must have for any DVD-enabled MST3K fan!",1044921600,19,954,4.787878787878788
1827918,5,B000087EYI,"What is there left to be said of MST3K and the hilarity it so generously gives us?
If you're even reading this review, it means you're probably a fan already, so I'll just say that ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People"" are two of the best episodes of the entire series (all ten years of it!).  Whenever I eat potatoes of any kind, I say, ""Oh, little winged potatoes.  This potato has big ears...""
Buy this boxed set, and hold it dear to your heart.",1044403200,4,443,4.261904761904762
1827919,5,B000087EYI,"Great movies, but this box set is hell on DVDs.
Some DVD cases are friendly to the disks, holding them securely while cleanly and safely releasing them when needed.  Others hold on too tightly, and require you bend the disk so you can grab it.  A few times in & out of the case, and your DVD is cracked.  Rhino needs to redesign its cases!
But the movies are great, and you gotta love the collection of shorts.  Finally Rhino is giving us extras!  Maybe now they'll finally add the documentaries, TV specials, interviews, and other content not officially available.",1044230400,,565,4.61
1827920,5,B000087EYI,"Three of these four releases from rhino are clssics, The cave dwellers is a confusing and poorly acted caveman feature starring miles o'keefe. Pod people...features one of the crabbiest bands ever, poachers, an ultra-annoying kid, and some aliens who look like biped anteaters. Shorts features a selection of shorts from the seasons of Mst and is delightfully hosted by Servo. As for angels revenge, this is the only MST I could not sit through Mike and the bots do their best but, in a season that already featured such horrors as the creeping terror, skydivers, the beast of yucca flats, and red zone cuba, they may have been worn out. The heroines of this movie, who cannot act worth a dang, by the way, foil a drug ring run by Jim Bakus, and Jack Palance I think. Anyway these movies are a better collection than the first one. I always liked Joel better but that is just me.",1042934400,5,879,4.569620253164557
1827921,5,B000087EYI,"Oh what a beautiful day! Angels Revenge, Cave Dwellers, Pod People, & Shorts Vol. 1 together in one glorious set. Three of these titles are personal favorites and the fourth (Cave Dwellers) has some good momemts.
Angels Revenge: What do you get when you add 7 busty babes, the skipper (Alan Hale), Mr. Haney (Pat Buttram), Thurston Howell (Jim Backus), Peter Lawford and Jack Palance? A laughable piece of poorly acted fluff. The seven jump-suited hunnies (they looked like Evil Kneivel groupies) couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The plot(?) revolves around these curvacious cuties deciding that they'd take on a drug cartel run by Peter Lawford and his main henchman Jack Palance. Mike and the bots are spot on with their riffing throughout. It makes you cringe seeing poor Jim Backus, a beloved character, sentenced to do this movie.
Cave Dwellers: Stars Miles O'Keefe in your typical low budget sword & sorcery flic. The movie is slow, confusing, and poorly acted but the segments by Joel & bots are priceless. In particular, their version of the movie's opening sequence with credits.
Pod People: What a disjointed collection of celluloid! The movie jumps around more than a jackrabbit on pcp. The story, such as it is, starts with a light in the sky crashing to earth. Three poachers cross paths with some goofy looking alien. Of course these dullards try to kill these long snouted bipedal creatures. A small boy with an annoying voice finds an alien egg and decides to take it home. It hatchs and lil' Trumpy is born. Meanwhile, the movie goes way out in leftfield by jumping to some putrid ""rock"" group singing the most incomprehensible song. Oh forget it! Joel & co. do a great job dissecting this corpse of a movie.
Shorts Vol. 1: Some of the best MST moments are these hilarious education shorts from the 50's & 60's. A sometimes innocent, sometimes disturbing window into America at that time.
Buy this volume when it is released, you won't be disappointed!",1042416000,54,1979,4.806451612903226
1827952,1,B000087EYI,"I remember watching this TV show some twenty-odd years ago and I thought it was pretty funny - sometimes.  After doing some research on the net for recommended shows, I could see that this particular volume had two recommended episodes on it.  Well, I can't say that there weren't some funny scenes, but, gee, a lot of the humor referred to movies and events that were current at the time of the episodes.  Me, I remember them but still thought the gags pretty dull for the most part.  I can only imagine how dull it might be for a younger person who would not know what was being referred to.

Anyway, I cannot begin to imagine how these volumes got four stars.  And at this price...?  Unbelievable!",1291939200,2,700,4.464566929133858
1827953,5,B000087EYI,"I am a MSTIE.
This is the first of the collection packages I have purchased.
Reason for that is the collections have NOT had all great episodes with them.  They may have 1 episode I really like but the rest were not stand outs to me.

This volume 2 is very good
Episode 622 ""Angel's Revenge"" is one of my favorites.  What a chessy late 1970's TV movie.  The D list of actors Jack Palance, late Peter Lawford, late Alan Hale Jr, late Jim Backus & late Pat Batrum.  So, you get a mini Gillian's Island reunion even though they do not share screen time.  Embarrassing .  But, let us quote 512 my favorite episode Mitchell ""The loser actor bouquet""

Episode 301 Cave Dwellers very funny, cheap action film
Episode 303 Pod People cheap sci/fi film.  ""It stinks!""

A fourth disc hosted by Tom Servo with some shorts on it.

A good, funny collection.

My complaint on the discs.  The chapter stops.  I was looking for stops where memorable scenes were.  Nope.  Angel's Revenge no ""Shine Your Love"" chapter stop.  Cave Dwellers fighting ""invisible"" villains & of course snakes growling & the hang glider NO chapter stop to find those with ease.",1279929600,,1136,4.544554455445544
1827954,4,B000087EYI,"If you're reading this, then you're probably already familiar with MST3K (the abbreviation of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for its fans, the ""Misties""); however, if this is possibly your first foray into MST3K-dom, here's a brief synopsis of the show in general:

A workaday Joe working 9-5 at an institute run by mad scientists is sent into space and subjected to experiments on a specially made satellite. What kind of experiments? Well, the scientists send him bad B-grade (or worse) movies and he and his robots make fun of them in grand, sarcastic fashion.

Now, what films are included in this set? Well, let's see...

Shorts Vol. 1
Not a standalone movie in itself, this is a collection of short educational films (the kind that students watched during the 1950s-1970s) that are so dated, they're hilarious. If this is your first time with MST3K, start here - you won't be disappointed. Almost all (if not all) of these segments are led by Joel. There are about 7 shorts, most notably including:
The Home Economics Story
Junior Rodeo Daredevils
A Date with Your Family
When I first watched these, I laughed so hard I was crying and my sides hurt. Recommended!

Angel's Revenge
A bizarre cross between Charlie's Angels and the A-Team, this film finds a team of teachers, pop singers, martial artists, models and stuntwomen joining forces to fight a drug kingpin and his lackey (played, respectively, by a depressingly bad Peter Lawford and Jack Palance). There's nothing subtle about this movie, not in the slightest, and Mike and the gang have a field day with the appalling 70s-ness of the whole thing.

Cave Dwellers
A badly dubbed Conan clone starring Miles (""Tarzan the Ape Man"") O'Keefe as Ator, the master of ancient swordplay and sciences. Ator must save the Great One and his invention, the Geometric Nucleus, from the clutches of the villainous Zar. This movie has absolutely no plot, exceedingly low production values, opening credits which don't relate to the movie at all, and tons of continuity problems (something the final host segment hits right out of the park). Joel hosts.

Pod People
Another badly dubbed film, which can't decide whether it wants to be a cuddly, kid-friendly ""ET"" rip-off or a terrifying tale of an evil alien running amok in the north woods. Joel and the gang do a great job making fun of the absolutely unsympathetic characters, as well as the synthed-out, annoying soundtrack.",1270339200,,2425,4.931372549019608
1827955,5,B000087EYI,"The two Joel-era episodes chosen for this volume include ""Pod People"" - a fan favorite and also one of my faves. That and ""Cave Dwellers"" fall into the category of ""terrible, but watchably so"". The packaging is neat and interactive. It's always good to have some Shorts on hand for shorter MST3K viewing sessions (My wife doesn't like to invest 90 minutes in a bad movie, even with the riffing she thinks that's too much time.)",1269561600,,427,4.631578947368421
1827956,4,B000087EYI,"This is the nineth MST3K DVD box set that I have gotten. It contains three episodes. All of them are from the Comedy Central-era of the show. Unlike the first volume, this set contains only three entire episodes. The fourth disk in the set is packed with shorts from different seasons of MST3K. This set, like the first one, has moving parts on the front of it. The only problem that I had with the one I ordered was that a bit of the cover was missing. Somehow, it must have been torn off. Overall, I would recommend this set to any ""MSTie."" It's great fun.",1249948800,,558,4.273584905660377

1827960,5,B000087EYI,"Finally, a Volume with solely excellent episodes!  Why can't Rhino do this all the time?

Angel's Revenge is beyond awesome.  The plot (har har) revolves around five retarded bimbos who are attempting to be cool and teach kids not to do drugs (although it's mostly about the female stars' curves and low necklines).  There's a horrible disco song, a drug dealer who can't stand up to a middle-school child, and two wonderfully embarrassing scenes with Jim Backus.  This is only a drop in the bucket; this film is full of sinking stars, horrible music, retarded dialogue, Hanna-Barbera sound effects, and debatable messages.  The riffs seem effortless (watch out for ""Sweet tarts!"" and ""These people would riot for KC and the Sunshine Band!"").  Even if all the episodes in this volume sucked, I would recommend it on the virtue of this movie alone.

Cave Dwellers is ""faaaaabulous!""  I'd tell you what the plot was, but I still don't know what it is and I've watched it over and over for the last eight years.  Okay, okay, I guess there's your basic ""kill the nasty man"" plot... but there's so much more!  Join Ator, the only man brave enough to wear moon boots (and little else) on an epic adventure to save some dull old man and his rearview mirror.  Witness the epic battles between buff Ator and a giant velour snake puppet!  Marvel at Thong's power to catch fish!  Cringe in fear at the weird relationship between Dull Old Man and his daughter!  And don't forget Thong turning into an owl and back real fast, the growling snakes, a hang-glider built in five minutes, and an uplifting song by Tom Servo about the wonders of flying with Ator.

Pod People may be retarded, but it's also going to be one of the episodes you'll find yourself watching over and over.  This film seems patched together from random films; its credits feature footage from some other movie that turns out to be completely unrelated to the rest of the movie.  Good luck trying to make sense of it the first time you watch it; it tries to bring four different stories together while throwing random pictures of deer into the mix.  To lighten things up, there's a garbledygook song sung by the protagonists.  (Thankfully, most of them die.)  The aliens are adorable little furry Snuffleupagus people, one of whom kills everyone he touches (no doubt for the kicks).  The best part of this movie is the kid with his distressing girly-voice and the magical Trumpy bedroom scene.  Watch for the ""magical"" host segment featuring flying bots and a possessed banana.

Admittedly, the shorts are a letdown for me.  The best ones are ""Body Care and Grooming,"" ""Cheating,"" and ""A Date with Your Family.""  The others are snooze-fests.  I don't recommend watching them all in a row -- the most boring ones are also the longest, and drag the whole collection down.

Don't let that turn you off; 90% of this collection is absolutely golden.  It's also a great way to introduce people to MST3k.  What are you waiting for?  Snap it up now!",1221696000,,2998,4.696737044145873
1827961,4,B000087EYI,"If you are a fan of MST3K, then this is one you don't want to miss. Pod People, in my opinion, is the best movie during the Joel era of MST3K. That alone is worth buying this DVD. A movie that I was surprised about in a good way was the movie Cave Dwellers. It is a Conan the Barbarian rip off, and not that bad of a film. Crow, Mike and Tom Servo even seem to enjoy it, but of course there are things to be made fun of about the movie.

What brings this down and makes this a four star DVD is mostly for the fact that Angel's Revenge is on here. That movie is so boring, MST3k can't save it. I feel asleep during it and so did one of the other people watching it with me, and that was during the day! A very boring and cofusing movie that jokes couldn't even save. Overall, a really cool DVD to have. Just beware of Angel's Revenge!",1214870400,,833,3.9

Volume2 of MST3000 is not bad at all.
Of the set, the shorts volume 1 is my absolute favorite. Its nothing short of brilliant.

So I bought them once before, then I bought this set, and have just about worn the discs out by taking them with me to Korea, Iraq, and now another tour over seas... I'm gonna buy a copy just to keep in case these ones get too bad. I Can't live with out Pod People, Or Cave Dwelleres, and Angels' Revenge was the best Jim Backus movie he made after he died.
This is the best set!!!!
I know I have them All...",1203552000,3,564,4.0
1827974,5,B000087EYI,"In the second release in the Rhino Mystery Science Theater DVD series, we are treated to three horrifically bad movies and several even worse shorts.

""Angels Revenge"" is an embarrassing and blatant ripoff of ""Charlie's Angels"" in which a group of unlikable women in polyester get together to fight crime. The film has some fairly big name stars including Jack Palance, Arthur Godfrey, Peter Lawford, Jim Backus, Alan Hale, and Pat Butrum as the world's most easily bamboozled car salesman. Look for lots of big hair, lots of bad clothes, lots of bad acting, and an utterly ludicrous storyline. It is, in other words, an excellent episode.

""Cave Dwellers"" is my least favorite of the episodes, as I don't like the swords and sandals epics all that much. This one stars Miles O'Keefe as Ator, a warrior on a mission that involves considerable (if silly) peril, and who invents the hang glider in the most laughable scene in this extremely laughable movie. The writing for this episode is first rate, with Joel and the bots coming up with countless great riffs, despite the less than entertaining background movie.

""Pod People"" is easily my favorite film of the set. It is a foreign made mess about miniature aardvark-like bipeds from another planet, one of which is good, and at least one of which is evil. There is a terrible band on a camping holiday who intersect with a story about poachers and the family harboring the good creature, Trumpy. This one has numerous great lines; the host segments are likewise some of the best ever featured, and the spoof of the song from the movie (""Bees on pie""...""Flying over trout"") is one of the all time greats and made ""It stinks!"" a regular reference for the remainder of the show's run. This film has everything for a perfect MST...inane plot, terrible acting (along with odd dubbing), a completely ridiculous monster (I love the peanut eating scene), and various unrelated subplots that are all over the place. This one film justifies the price of the set by itself.

The last disc in the set is ""Shorts Volume One"" and contains a variety of bizarre shorts on a variety of disquieting subjects. ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"" is legendary for introducing the character of ""Ol' Timer Billy Slater"" to the series, but the strangest of the bunch in my opinion is ""The Chicken of Tomorrow,"" which is simultaneously funny and macabre. ""A Date with Your Family"" is a noteworthy little nightmare from the ""Leave it to Beaver"" school: I'm all for family bonding, but this will make your eyes roll to the top of your skull.

All told this is a great set, and I highly recommend it to B-movie lovers everywhere.",1196812800,5,2644,4.776805251641138
1827975,5,B000087EYI,"Briefly: this is my favorite collection, save perhaps volume 10 which is not available for any reasonable sum at this point (and I do not own, but remember the episodes).  These aren't the watchable bad films like Manos, but they are so poorly conceived if produced competently enough as to be hilarious. The shorts hit a little close to home at times too.  Enjoy!",1188172800,,364,4.671875
1827976,5,B000087EYI,"This MST3K collection is the perfect set for both die-hard fans and viewers who are new to the show.  The movies are bad in a ripe, juicy way, making it easy to squeeze every last drop of possible humor out of their horrendous dialogue, lame-duck plots, and trapped-in-a-paper-bag acting.

For collectors and afficianados, this collection is a no-brainer.  For everyone else, it makes an excellent starter kit to get you into and hooked on this intelligent, delightful, and addictive show.  This particular set contains the following:

CAVE DWELLERS - Miles (and miles) O'Keefe stars as Ator, the greasy, chesty hero who must travel to the ends of the earth in order to stop a strange and mystical device (the Geometric Nucleus -- never seen, never explained, never mind) from falling into the evil hands of some man with a black swan helmet.  Along the way he fights invisible warriors (this film's version of cost-saving casting), a fiberglass cobra, and -- of course -- a few cave dwellers.  Both well-read and beefy, Ator is assisted in his quest by his mostly mute sidekick, Dong (or is it Wong? Chong? Ba-da-bong?), and a hubcap-clad warrior woman whose name, I believe, is Linda.  Joel and the bots discuss foley artist techniques, reprise the opening credits of the film in their own tongue-in-cheek fashion, and discuss ways bad movies make bad props sound better than they are.  Delicious if for no other reason than the hang-glider scene.

ANGELS REVENGE - A thinly disguised rip-off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-s-Angels/dp/B00008WJEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie's Angels</a>, this self-righteous dud treats us to feeble-minded drug dealers beating up school children and a typically-squinty Jack Palance doing as little acting as he possibly can.  Other down-on-their-luck stars exploit their dwindling fame as well (Peter Lawford, Pat Burtrum, Alan hale, Jim Backus, and Arthur Godfrey), prompting Tom to invent a Shame-O-meter, just to gauge how pathetic the movie really is.  A few of the host segments fall a little flat and seem short-changed, but that doesn't detract from Mike and the bots' able and always incisive commentary.  Listen for KPLOT, watch for the scenes of young teens being instructed on proper gun use, cringe at the overly-excessive administration of groin torture, and laugh at eight women ""sneaking"" into a drug compound in broad daylight while wearing downy-white Evel Kineval jumpers.

POD PEOPLE - The filet mignon of MST3K episodes, ""Pod People"" features some of the best jokes and gags Joel and the bots have ever pitted against a film.  This travesty of a movie concerns the deaths of a few brain-dead poachers (one of them is a Leslie Nielsen look-alike, the other looks like he belongs around the potato cauldron at a Renaissance Fair), the ""antics"" of a horrendous band (boasting a combined IQ of 12), and the machinations of a couple of murderous aliens that look like the love-children of Alf and an upright Hoover (with attachments).  The plot also follows a precocious young boy as he deals with parental neglect, his uncaring and alcoholic grand/father, and a whole host of traumatizing sights.  Featuring a hilarious spoof of one of the band's feature songs (""It stinks!"") and a delightful recreation of Trumpy's abilities, this episode contains everything that made MST3K a brilliant show.  If this one doesn't turn you into an fan, nothing will.

SHORTS, VOL. 1 - Okay, well, maybe this would be better for newbies.  Hosted by Tom Servo, this disc provides viewers with 10 and 15 minute ""shorts,"" brief, bite-sized educational clips hailing mostly from the 50s and designed -- primarily -- to teach suppression and the Great White Way to unsuspecting schoolchildren.  A short on Home Economics (one of my all-time favorites) follows four girls through college as they major in various things like baby sitting, how to set a table, and (no fooling!) being a good wife.  A short on good grooming encourages not just clean skin and hair, but also unswerving conformity to all traditional standards of clothing.  Speaking of conformity, ""A Date with Your Family"" is one of the most frightening short films I've ever seen, a diatribe on familial duty that demands that children dress casually for a home meal, never ask dad for money, and always make sure dinner time conversations are as unemotional as possible.  (Seriously.  The narrator uses the word ""unemotional."")  Others include an industrial arts segment (much like the Home Economics clip, except here you have guys talking about how much they love the ""smooth feel of wood pushing through a buzzing saw""), a piece on ""The Chicken of Tomorrow"" (a bizarre title for a boring subject), cheating (in which a young boy who cheats on a test is treated as a leperous pariah by rib-less students and teachers alike), and a Junior Rodeo in which young children risk their lives and spines for a fleeting moment of unbridled, bucking fame.

Unsettling Depression-era edutainment, 70's technicolor plaigarism, sci-fi/fantasy tomfoolery, and self-congratulatory heavy handedness: this collection harbors some of MST3K's worthiest (and cheesiest) foes.  It's a treasure to be able to watch Mike, Joel, Tom and Crow chop them to bits with high-brow allusions, goofy witticisms, and hilarious insights.  If you like watching bad movies with your best friends (or if you're the type who can't help making wise comments when you see something lame), MST3K should be a treat, making this collection the equivalent of a candy shop of humor.",1176595200,8,5597,5.194660734149054
1827977,5,B000087EYI,"I would recommend this box set for anyone who is new to Mystery Science Theater 3000; and if you're already a fan and you don't have this one, what are you waiting for?  ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People"" are two of the finest episodes in the shows ten year history.  The movies are just so goofy that they beg for commentary from Joel and his robot pals.  And they deliver with some of their best and funniest commentary ever. (Though some fans who prefer the Sci-fi channel era may disagree).  ""Angels Revenge"" is another fine episode because the movie is so terrible that you simply have to laugh.  Also features ""Shorts vol. 1, which contains several short films with classic commentary from Joel, Mike, Crow and Servo that will keep you laughing for hours.  Also, the skits on the Satellite are very funny as well, with several parodies of scenes from the featured movies.  For me, this is the best MST3k compilation from Rhino home video, along with volume five.  They are a little high priced, but check out Amazon's new and used section for a good deal.  It will be worth it.",1174608000,3,1081,4.5595854922279795
1827978,5,B000087EYI,"MST was pretty great throughout its run, but these flicks mark the apogee of the show's excellence.

""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People"" are the best. Both are, of course, horrid flicks, but even on their own are tremendously enjoyable. Joel and the Bots are completely on top of their riffing game, from their evisceration of Trumpy to Ator's hang-gliding performance (the latter answers the age-old question: How much Keefe is in this movie? The answer is obvious: Miles O'Keefe.

""Angel's Revenge"" is a tremendous '70s/'80s homage/ripoff of ""Charlie's Angels"", with a nod to Russ Meyer. The cast reads like a who's-who of spent actors of the era: Peter Lawford, Jim Backus, Alan Hale Jr., Jack Palance. Only ""Mitchell"" comes close to replicating the latter phenomenon.

The shorts are good, but somewhat superfluous.

Any fan of the series should have this as part of their collection.

Now if we could just get ""Master Ninja"" I & II, ""Alien from L.A."", ""The Giant Gila Monster"" amd ""Warrior of the Lost World"", my life would be complete. And ""Puma Man"".",1166832000,3,1054,4.932203389830509
1827979,5,B000087EYI,"This is a classic show!  I used to watch these as a kid on the SciFi channel and they are just as funny now that I am an adult!  The characters are great, and you will think that they made the movies up because they are just that bad...  The best part about this, is that when my sister-in-law was a kid and these were on TV, she saw her favorite movie as the subject of one of them.  I won't reveal which movie, but it is pretty funny when you recognise one of these!",1154908800,3,468,3.8947368421052633
1827980,5,B000087EYI,The movies they watch are ones that I hadn't ever seen before so that was a treat.  Joel and the robots are really funny in these and their comments are hilarious.  I had a real fun time with these and they are worth watching again and again.,1139961600,6,242,4.127659574468085
1827981,5,B000087EYI,"I just love this box set of volume 2 of MST3K. You can move pictures around and change them to other pictures. The episodes are genuine. The quality is fine, although a couple of words are not heared in the opening theme song in the episode Pod People.

So, here's a short summary of the episodes:

1) Pod People: I can feel Joel and the Bots's pain. Although, they did a hilarious job of riffing Pod People to pieces! The story follows an alien and it's murderous twin and a kid called Tommy who raises the alien and calling it Trumpy (!), and once he watched Trumpy's murderous twin killing someone, Tommy thinks Trumpy did it. Then all hell breaks loose. As Joel explains the whole movie for you, ""Trumpy! You can do stupid things!"" 10/10

2) Cave Dwellers: An Italian sleeper that has to do with a barbarian and his mute sidekick killing bandits to save their villiage. Lots of funny bits with Joel and the bots. Especially the opening credits skit. 9/10

3) Angel's Revenge (AKA Angel's Brigade): A 1979 yawner with a plot that rips off Charlie's Angels. I don't have anything else to say. There's an ultra hlarious skit with the bots playing cards and Mike intruding wearing a leather jacket saying, ""eeeeeeeeee"" and the bots have no choice but to destry him. 9/10

What do you have to do: BUY IT!!!",1138838400,6,1305,4.512711864406779
1827992,5,B000087EYI,"Several excellent choices with Joel as your host. Why watch bad movies? Because sometimes you just don't realize the astounding skill behind the good ones until you see these mind-bogglingly bad ones!

ANGEL'S REVENGE. A STUNNINGLY bad rip-off of the bad TV show ""Charlie's Angels."" As one reviewer put it: ""women decide to wage war on L.A.'s drug dealers by dressing in white jump suits.""  Amazingly, it co-stars: Jack Palance, Jim Backus, Alan Hale, Peter Lawford (who appears to be drunk) and . . . ARTHUR GODFREY! How did this happen? Maybe they thought it was an actual movie of the show  and the casting folks told everyone simultaneously that ""we've got XXX"" and they all agreed on the basis of thinking that the other guy was in-- but failed to read the script! A favorite scene is the raid on the huge drug-processing facility (apparently invisible to the police) guarded by a simple 2-strand barbed wire fence. One Angel can't manage to cut through with her wire-clippers so ad-libs by rolling underneath . . . and so on. (This movie completely ruined ""The Road Home"" for me. There were too many long scenes in which little Chinese girl runs over the hills after the schoolteacher and all I could think of was the 'bots refrain of ""She's running and running and running and running . . . and running and running and running . . . "" from ""Angel's Revenge."")

CAVE DWELLERS. A hilarious knock-off of ""Conan the Barbarian."" For those who question the artistry of a show involving a guy and his robots making cracks about bad movies . . . consider how hard that is to do while laughing so hard you can't catch a breath. Notice the opening footage which has NOTHING at all to do with the movie which also has nothing to do with caves or dwellers.

POD PEOPLE. Opening footage appears to be made by the same outfit that made the opening footage for cave-dwellers. It also has nothing to do with the movie, or if it does, notice that the monster changes from a Creature-From-The-Black-Lagoon sort of monster to a Snuffleupuggalus sort of muppety thing. My least favorite of the collection, but if you want BAD, it's way up there on the Bad-O-Meter.

SHORTS. ""The Home Economics Story"" encourages high school girls to study home economics -- particularly poignant for me because the school appears to be Iowa State where my mother did just that, often talking about the group house. ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"" shows kids setting up a rodeo (and Head Injury!!! Yeeehaaaa!!!) Also ""Body Care & Grooming"", ""Cheating"" (which gets the star kicked off the Student Council (""You've made some powerful enemies son!""), ""A Date with Your Family"", ""Why Study Industrial Arts"" (the guy's version of ""The Home Economics Story""), and ""The Chicken of Tomorrow.""

Just a terrific collection!",1136073600,8,2776,4.782881002087683
1827993,4,B000087EYI,"I have owned 2 of the 3 features on VHS for years. First recorded from ""Com' Cent'"" and ""Sci-Fi Chnl"" then the Rhino releases and now treasured in DVD... w\ so much less worry about damage to the medium, (no hungry vcrs). Pod People is my intro and subsequent addiction to the MST3k phenom. The parody of the indecipherable studio is quintessential Mistie. The film itself is insufferable...and yet Joel and bots make it more effective at lifting spirits than chemically assisted methods. (Or so I'm told). Cave Dwellers is my second favorite ""holding"" and one that I can plug in at random and sync up as though I'd been watching all along. From the slip on the ""just mopped"" cave floor to the ""mascar-eyed"" 1000 BC beauty limping due to the arrow stuck in her hubcap... Oh, sorry BREASTPLATE... I do recommend these for fun or therapy.

Lastly for a credibility reference... I HAVE seen movies that were so bad that even the ""Satellite of Love"" inmates couldn't guide me though them (ex. ""Mitchell"") these 2 aforementioned are worse! And yet they are my favorites.

The ""I"";""me""; and ""my"" perspective is all I'll offer...we all have unique tastes... but in this reviewers' humble opinion you'll not regret this addition to your collection... even if its' the ONLY one in your collection.

Said enough already, so check the other reviewers for the rest of the media.

1827994,5,B000087EYI,"This is a good compiolation of classic episodes, there isn't really any dull moments, except if you're only paying attention to the movie, instead of Tom, Crow, Joel, or Mike, then yes, it will be very boring. This collection features 4 DVDs, with B movies mostly from the 80's.

 Movie 1. ANGELS REVENGE: I never quite understood the plot of the movie, but it seems like its mainly about a group of female spies, a cheesy Bond like re-make, or if you're into the really horrible Cartoon network show Totaly Spies, it will be equivalent to that as well.

 Movie 2. CAVE DWELLERS: Now this is a classic....seems to be about a Hercules like hero named Ator, who's trying to help this one girl save (don't know her name) to save her father from his captor. ""So, lets recap the action so far..."" which appears to be about ""ummmm...none so far"" which about sums it up for the movie. At the end, they are more then upset with the movie ""You know, we had it the worst, we had to watch you watching the movie"" says Forrester. Crow shows Dr. Forrester the mistakes they found in the movie. ""What do you want from us? We're evil....evil""!!

 Movie 3. POD PEOPLE: No....this has nothing to do with Pods, and it has nothing to do with People, it has everything to do with HURTING. It's a foreign film that is dubbed over, sometimes the voices are a little off at times, and it seems like it tries to be an ET rip off mixed in with a horror film. It's about a comet that crashes on earth, in a forrest that has alien eggs on it. 3 poachers see are in the movie periodically who first see the comet, Tom Servo shows us his Yoda impression ""Luke..use the force Luke"". A high-pitch annoying little kid comes and brings an egg home which hatches revealing the ""Pod Person"" who later in the movie starts killing everyone for no reason. There is even a really bad pop band that plays on the movie as well, and they travel to where the cabin, a drive that seems to take at least an hour of the film ""we bought the van so we're gonna film it"" cracks up Crow. They end up setting camp near that the kid and the family cabin. ""okay, is this movie C or D""? Asks the lost Servo. This is a funny movie thats probably one of the best in this collection.

 Movie 4. SHORTS VOL. 1: A great collection of shorts, some appear in previous DVDs from MST3k box set 1, but still a great laugh. Probably the best ones on here are CHEATING, about a boy who cheats on his math exam and then gets kicked out of the student council. ""You've made some powerfull enemies son"". The second one is A DATE WITH YOUR FAMILY, an old film that is now knows as ""The Woody Allen Story,"" a hillarious 50's or 60's show about how a modern family should do before, and during a dinner with your family, remember, it's always accustomed to say grace before eating, what could be going through this families head? ""Please God take me now"". Finally last but not least, WHY STUDY INDUSTRIAL ARTS? About a highschool student who seems to be obsessed with being a carpender ""I keep a magazine of Popular Mechanics under my mattress"". Which the gang seems to have some of the best comments on here.

 This is a great collection over all, and I suggest that you get it.",1091750400,12,3207,4.321131447587354
1827995,5,B000087EYI,"This is Rhino's second DVD collection of four episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" and it's excellent. It has three great episodes from various seasons, and a fourth disc of hilarious short subjects. And it comes in a nifty package with moving parts!
In case you're new to the world of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (MST3K for short, that's what us fans -- ""Misties"" -- call it), this is the famous TV show where a silhouette of a man and two robots in theater seats provide running commentary for some of the worst movies ever made. The ninety-minute episodes are scattered with sketches and songs and amount to some of the smartest, most pop-culture savvy, side-splitting comedy ever made.
This DVD contains three episodes, plus a compilation of short subjects from different episodes. The episodes cover a wide spectrum: two are from early in season three, when Joel Hodgson was the host and the show was just kicking into high gear. The third is from late in the sixth season, when the show had developed a much more slick and sarcastic approach with host Mike Nelson. People new to the show will get a good chance to compare the styles of the show. Personally, I love both, but they are quite different. The Shorts are brief films that the host would sometimes make fun of before the movie. Originally, they watched episodes of old movie serials, but when those quickly became tiresome, they turned to educational, commercial, and industrial filmstrips (you know, those annoying things you had to watch at school assemblies in sixth grade?). They contain some of the funniest riffing in the series, and are favorites of the fans.
Here's what's on this collection:
ANGEL'S REVENGE. Episode #622. A 1978 film originally titled ""Angel's Brigade,"" this is an hysterically awful rip-off of the TV show ""Charlie's Angels,"" only it's worse, if you can imagine that! A group of attractive and not-so-attractive women decide to wage war on L.A.'s drug dealers by dressing in white jump suits. The female leads (including Playboy Playmate Susan Lynn Kiger) are horrendous actresses, but what's really embarrassing is the presence of well-known guest stars slumming at the pits of their careers: Jack Palance, Jim Backus, Pat Butrum, Alan Hale, and in a depressing performance, Peter Lawford. Poor Peter appears to have been drunk for the entire filming. Mike and the `Bots have an absolute field day making fun of the relentless 70s style (""Entertaining was a lot easier in the 70s!"") and the poor, unfortunate guest stars (""Do you think Peter knows where he is?""). This is one of my favorite Mike Nelson episodes, and it's the best disc in this package.
CAVE DWELLERS. Episode #301. This film was originally released in 1984 as ""Ator the Invincible"" and then as ""Blade Master"" on video. It's a sequel to ""Ator the Fighting Eagle,"" and is one of many cheap-o copycats of ""Conan the Barbarian."" This stinker stars Miles O'Keefe as beefy warrior Ator, who also knows lots of sciencey stuff (like how to manufacture a hang-glider in two minutes with just sticks). Ator travels to the Ends of the Earth to stop some John Saxon-like villain from obtaining some vague object with a funny name that might do something really bad. Or whatever -- the film is just fantasy of the worst kind. It's so cheap there are no special effects, and the only monster is an immobile velour snake. This is first episode of season three, and this is really when the show entered its golden phase. Joel and the `Bots have some good times here, especially at the outlandish finale, and there's a hilarious parody of the movie's opening credits. A good episode, and the start of great things.
POD PEOPLE. Episode #303. The poor dubbing in this film automatically marks it as foreign, but since it's obviously trying to pass itself off American, it's tricky to figure out where it was really shot. Mystery over: this is a 1983 Spanish film called ""Los Nuevos Extraterrestres,"" released in America as ""The Unearthling."" It's an awful attempt to copy ""E.T."" and combine it with a horror film. Aliens that resemble miniature two-legged versions of Snuffleupuggus from ""Sesame Street"" invade the mountains. A high-pitched little kid befriend one of the aliens, Trumpy, while the rest start killing people for no reason. There's an awful pop band on a trip (their performance in a recording studio is one of the highlights of the episode), some poachers, and a dysfunctional family up in a cabin. None of it fits together, but Joel and `Bots create some classic running gags. It's the perfect kind of film for the MST3K treatment. You'll love their re-creation of the incomprehensible ""song"" performed by the band in the move. (""It stinks!"")
SHORTS, VOL. 1. These come from many seasons, and all are great. Tom Servo does a joking intro for each one. ""The Home Economics Story"" (from episode #317) is a 1950s film for high school girls that encourages them to study home economics in college, implying that they aren't destined for anything other than being housewives. ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"" (from episode #407) tells how a group of kids in a tiny town set up their own rodeo, and then broke all their limbs and snapped their spinal chords -- all in good fun! ""Body Care & Grooming"" (from episode #510) informs college students how to spend all their time grooming their hair and skin, because people will only like them if they're pretty! ""Cheating"" (from episode #515) tells the tragic story of Johnny, who cheated and rose to power, and then fell into the pits of despair not unlike a Kafka novel. ""A Date with Your Family"" (from episode #602) is the best of the bunch: a nightmare about the perfect 50s family having a perfectly repressed 50s dinner. The riffing here is as sharp and satiric as anything ever done on the show. ""Why Study Industrial Arts"" (from episode #609) is the reverse of ""The Home Economics Story,"" encouraging young men to risk sawing off their limbs in shop class. And finally, ""The Chicken of Tomorrow"" (from episode #702) explains breeding techniques to create meatier chickens. It's very depressing.
(In a bit of a mistake, two of the shorts are already available on other DVDs: episode #609, ""The Skydivers"" is on the first Rhino DVD collection, and Episode #515, ""The Wild World of Batwoman,"" is available as a single DVD, so you might have already seen two of these shorts.)
This is another awesome collection from Rhino. There's more laughs here than you'll find in a year's worth of Hollywood comedies. A must for MST3K fans and newcomers alike!",1078272000,206,6556,4.854464285714286
1827996,5,B000087EYI,"In my opinion, Volume 2 is the best of the four sets released thus far. ""Pod People"" and ""Cave Dwellers"" are among MST3K's classic episodes, and what fan would miss out on the Shorts?
Angels Revenge: T&A are the main assets in this Charlie's Angels ripoff, wherein buxom vigilantes fight drug dealers. Notable stars include Alan ""Skipper"" Hale, Jim ""Thurston"" Backus, Pat ""Mr. Haney"" Buttram, and Jack Palance -- all obviously in more desperate times.
Pod People: A magical ALF wannabe from outer space visits a northern town -- wackiness ensues. ""Pod People"" uses the cinematic convention that aliens will attack adults and befriend children. As Dr. Forester says, ""It has nothing to do with pods, nothing to do with people, and everything to do with HURTING"".
Cave Dwellers: A knockoff of Conan the Barbarian, ""Cave Dwellers"" features a medieval world vaguely under attack. The heroine's pie pan chestplate and an inexplicable hang-gliding scene make this one a breeze for Joel and the Bots. Not as good at the Steve Reeves Hercules episodes, but still good fun.
Shorts: Arguably the best part of MST3K, the Shorts Volume 1 collects half of the bits from the Shorts VHS collection for your viewing pleasure. The shorts are a nice change of pace from the two-hour films, which can become tedious after a while if you're not in the mood for them. They also cover topics *so* obscure (from chicken farming to industrial arts to ""A Date With Your Family"") that you can be sure this is the only time they'll ever be on DVD.
As stated, this is my favorite MST3K volume. It may not be the best collection to pull in new fans, but for veterans of the series, it's definitely the best Rhino's released yet.",1073779200,27,1699,4.762711864406779
1827997,5,B000087EYI,"This is arguably the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 boxed set yet. The episodes (""Angels' Revenge,"" ""Cave Dwellers,"" ""Pod People"") are incredibly funny, and the intermission scenes are some of the best the series has ever done.
""Angels' Revenge,"" from the director of ""Final Justice,"" is a ridiculous ""Charlie's Angels"" rip-off starring Jack Palance, Jim Backus, and Peter Lawford. ""Pod People"" is a ridiculous ""E.T."" rip-off, featuring one of the worst-designed aliens in movie history. ""Cave Dwellers,"" my favorite in this box, is a ridiculous ""Conan the Barbarian"" rip-off starring Miles O'Keeffe. In addition, there is a disc of shorts hosted by Tom Servo, which is very, very funny.
The DVDs are in their original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The intermission segments look bright and sharp and sound fine as well. The movie segments are dark, muddy, and soft, however that's the way they've always looked, and to digitally remaster them would be pointless.

1827998,5,B000087EYI,"Rhino continues producing MST3K boxed sets, and I can't thank them enough.  They foster my MST collecting habit with each release.  I adore the boxed sets and recommed them for any devoted MiSTie.  That said, on to the Film Blecch in this set.
Angels Revenge (bad puctuation not mine):  a blatant, charm-free Charlie's Angels poser.  The 'angels' aren't even remotely attractive, but they use their womenly wiles to bring down the drug trade.  The real surprise in this one is the --ahem-- famous names, like Jim Backus, Alan Hale (he's shown up in a BUNCH of MST-treated flicks), and good heavens--Mr. Haney.  Summary:  cheesy 70s T&A theme flick, with as little story as possible, so as not to burden the audience.  A dippy teacher rounds up a model, a scary stuntwoman, a lousy Vegas singer, and some other person to defeat the pushers.  This one takes more than one viewing to enjoy the jokes, because it is JUST that bad.
Cave Dwellers:  Rhino was smart to package this movie in the set that houses its sibling, Pod People.  This cinematic train wreck has the same jumbled production values of Pod People--you'll recognize it immediately.  Signature element:  scenes from some other movie play behind the opening credits.  Cave Dwellers gave Miles O'Keefe a set of fringed boots, a tiny loincloth, and not much else.  You will HOWL during the host segment when Joel & the Bots do a half-screen action sequence of the guy with the fruity hat.
Summary:  ??  go to the ends of the earth, and you still won't get what this turkey is about.  Images not to be missed:  Ator & Thong's fight with invisible monsters, Ator hangliding, and the scene with the ""Most Attractive Man of the Middle Ages--MY MY MY!""  Ultimately, there is a short bit of the actual Cave Dwellers, but the film has zero to do with them. ??
Pod People:  HUZZAH!  A real crapfest, complete with a bargain basement Alf wannabe.  Can you imagine the pitch for this film?  I think it must've gone like this:  let's have a cuddly but murderous alien, a bad rock band, a weird mountain family with a poorly dubbed child, and OH!  for extra spice, POACHERS!  If this leaves you saying, ""What the hell?"" -- you are ready to watch the movie.
Summary:  cuddly Alf-like killers inconvenience a bad rock group's weekend in the mountains.
Shorts, Vol 1:  the best Shorts volume, IMHO.  This set of shorts has actual hosting by Tom and includes The Home Economics Story, Junior Rodeo Daredevils, Body Care & Grooming (they're cops!), Cheating, A Date with Your Family, and Why Study Industrial Arts?  A Date with Your Family is my personal favorite--""A violent argument erupts over whose day was more pleasant.""  This short couldn't get any whiter if it tried.  Life in the 50s as introduced to us by the MST cast!
A great boxed set--pop the popcorn and get ready for cinema's disasters to spin in your player.  A must for MST collectors, and even the box design is cute!",1067299200,8,2927,4.68369351669941
1827999,1,B000087EYI,"Last year I made a discovery... MST3K.  Well, not really, I'd been watching the episodes for years.  I only became VERY interested last year because I discovered Rhino had started issuing the MST episodes on DVD and including the original unedited films on the flip-side of the disks.  The first four episodes Rhino put on DVD, I Accuse My Parents, Red Zone Cuba, Mitchell and Manos had lacked this feature and I had not been interested in getting those.
As a collector of odd-ball films I own a ton (many of them are Rhino tapes), but when Rhino started putting out double-sided DVD disks I became a died-in-wool MST collector too because for me the MSTied versions are like really, really good commentary tracks added to the disks. They are the kind of commentary tracks that all good DVD commentary tracks should aspire to be!
But now I discovered beginning with MST3K - Collection Volume 2, Rhino has reverted to the old practice of only one-sided disks!! Shame!! Tragedy!!  On top of that, they've left the retail price in the same ballpark as the first collection which contained both versions of each film!
Oh yeah, I've read posts from others, ""Rhino doesn't need to put the un-MSTied versions on the disks, those films are not worth viewing anyway!  TRUE MST fans only want the MST episodes, blah, blah, blah""  Well, here is one person who is really saddened that Rhino has lowered the value of their disks (and not lowered the price!)  Shame!
Who was the marketing genius at Rhino who dreamed this one up?  I think there are other folks like me who enjoyed having the original films on the disks.  I thought Rhino staff were people who (like me) who had a genuine love for off-beat cinema!  Maybe Rhino has marketing-types running the show at company headquarters now instead of people who have a love for the product.
Here's the short version: Rhino won me over by putting out MST WITH the uncut films. Yes I'm still a big MST fan, but when allocating scarce dollars I will think twice about what gets purchased first.  You know what?  I don't own any of the single-sided disks. Rhino can sit on 'em!  I'll buy them when they show up in the $5 cut-out bins.

1828000,5,B000087EYI,"It was certainly a brilliant move on Rhino's part to include two of the very best episodes of MST3K, ""Pod People"" and ""Cave Dwellers"" in one collection. There would have only been 2 ways to make it even better.
1. To have also included another great episode, and one of my personal favorites, ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"".
2. Instead of the rather dull and uninspired ""Angels Revenge"", they could have included the much funnier and lesser known ""Incredible Melting Man""...which was the best of the Mike Nelson episodes (in my opinion of course).
But you can't have it all. And this collection is the best of the bunch, so far. and what you lose by having ""Angels Revenge"", you make up for by having the delightful ""Shorts"" disk, a feature of the show that was always a highlight.
I freely admit that in my opinion the show was never the same when original host and series creator Joel Hodgson left, but the show remained a laugh-out-loud study in sarcasim. and i never get tired of reliving old times with Crow, Tom Servio and the rest of the guys on the Satellite Of Love.",1064966400,2,1071,4.525773195876289

I just played the DVD now, and Tom Servo very definitely and clearly says ""Dad, I'm dating a negro!"" So have no fear, all the jokes are in place.",1055894400,7,318,4.406779661016949

7979363,5,B000087EYI,"If you're looking to test the boundaries of friendship and want to make a good first impression with this show, you've found the right collector's edition to do it with. It has all manner of bells and whistles just on the packaging alone, commercial shorts and side skits you might've missed before, two episodes largely agreed to be the best in the series as the main attraction, and a third Charlie's Angels rip-off about scantily clad women fighting druglords that's at least... visually entertaining. I failed at sharing it with multiple room-mates and have resolved from now on to watching it only as intended: alone, covered in cats and junk food, wheezing hysterically into my carton of non-dairy Chunky Monkey ice cream until I accidentally inhale something. Because friendships come and go, but my own questionable sense of humor will last to the grave.",1486166400,,862,4.993055555555555

Like early MST sets from Rhino; this comes with a shorts collection that's so-so.

The other titles are also not the best in the cannon - but, ""Angels' Revenge"" is fun on a rainy afternoon.

7979370,5,B000087EYI,"Rhino continues off from part 1 where they bring selected episodes from the beloved cult TV show and possibly my fave show of all time knwon as MST3K which is Mystery Science Theater 3000 for short. Michael J. Nelson and Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgeson) with their robot pals Crow T. Robot (Trace Beaulieu) and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) with the help of Gypsy and Cambot are still in space being taunted by Dr. Clayton Forrestor (Trace Beaulieu) and assistant Frank (Frank Coniff) as they throw them some stinky films to watch.

Starting off with ""Angel's Revenge"" it seems the boys are watching an unsexy attempt at an exploitation ""Charlie's Angels"" wannabe movie that stars Jack Palance, Jim ""Mr. Magoo"" Buckuss and Alan Hale Jr. as it features a group of women and a teen girl who are trying to fight a drug lord. The movie is bad as it has one hot chick played by a playmate but the rest of the film is pure mind boggling awfulness that only the boys can sink their teeth into, i like how they did some funny sketches like one that spoofs 70's exploitation called ""Chocolate Jones"".

Second comes one of my fave episodes called ""Cave Dwellers"" from the third season which is originally called ""Blade Master"" that is a sequel to ""Ator The Invincible"", it's a 1984 Italian-US barbarian fantasy epic with Miles O'Keef as Ator as he is joined by an oriential warrior called Thong (Chen Wong) and lovely female warrior Mila (Lisa Foster) as they must rescue the girl's uncle from a tyrant (David Brandon) who has a special device that can hurt humanity. Cave Dwellers was one of my first MST3K videos i purchased back in 96 at 15 and has been one of my fave episodes ever, this is one's humor is terrific including original one-liners Crow does for Ator in the film and how they are amazed by that amusing hang-glider sequence in the film.

Next comes the best episode in my opinion of the show ever that has became a beloved one since 91 on it's third season called ""Pod People"". After doing an invention exchange as sometimes even with the Baddie's public domain karaoke machine they are being punished by watching a bizarre but faulty 1983 Spanish Sci-fi film called ""Pod People"" directed by Piquor Simon of ""Pieces"" and ""Slugs"" fame as it's a cross between John Carpenter's The Thing and ET about a meteor from space that lands in the woods somewhere as some boy who lives with his uncle and mom witnesses as 2 hunters go after it, get killed by a weird anteater-esque alien that goes on the loose and the boy raises the alien's baby as a rock group from the big city go into the woods for a sexual holiday until it turns into a nightmare. A brilliant episode with great jokes mainly from ""Cheif and McLoud"" and how they make fun of the movie during the segments.

Finally ""Shorts Vol. 1"" features a collection of 7 amusing educational short films such as ""Grooming and Body Care"", ""Why Study Industrial Arts"", ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"", ""Chicken of Tommorow"", ""A Date with Your Family"", ""Home Economics Story"" and ""Cheating"" which the boys riff on.",1313625600,,3049,4.619926199261992
7979371,4,B000087EYI,"This out of print DVD set from Rhino for Mystery Science Theater 3000 had some keepers.

Angels' Revenge(1979): This low budget, action-packed, exploitation film from director Greydon Clark is a clone of the Charlie's Angels TV show. Clark also borrows a page from The Seven Samurai(1954) by having seven female heroines with different, ethnic backgrounds. Jack Palance, Peter Lawford, Arthur Godfrey, and Alan Hale Jr. give ""star power"" to the film. The Seven Angels played by B-movie starlets having an ill-conceived plot to destroy a drug making factory. Angels Revenge(alias Angels Brigade) is packed with awful 1970's cliches. There's a cheesy disco song in a Las Vegas nightclub. Angels Revenge is bad, but not boring. My friends find the film riveting and thrilling. They have trouble sitting through the MST3K version of The Unearthly(a slow paced horror film).

Cave Dwellers(1984): This Italian sword and sorcery film starring Miles O' Keefe is a poor man's Conan The Barbarian(1982). In Italy, it's known as Ator The Invincible Part II. It's also known as The Blade Master. Ator(Miles O' Keefe) and an Asian swordsman(Chen Wong) help a cute, sensual, young woman(Lisa Foster) rescue her father from a megalomaniac warlord. This film is bad, but fun.

Pod People(1983): In Spain, this film is called Los Nuevos Extraterrestres(The New E.T.). Director Juan Piquer Simon tried to make an Alien knock off, but the producers ordered him to make an E.T style film. Susana Bequer(Susan Blake) plays the film's Southern belle Laura Stapleton. Bequer is older than me and she still looks youthful and sensual! A boy named Tommy raises a being from outer space and he names him Trumpy. Unfortunately, Trumpy's evil brother is killing people in the area! Juan Piquer Simon also directed a slasher film called Pieces and it has some of the same cast. This film has a corny pop song that has a cult following. I think it's called ""Idiot Control Now"" or ""Hear the Engines Roll Now"". MST3K fans love Pod People!
This is as bad as Mac and Me(1988)!

Shorts Vol. 1: This DVD is a compilation of ""shorts"" used to pad out short movies from MST3K. These are breezier than two hour MST3K episodes if one's impatient.

If we're lucky, these episodes will be released on DVD again.",1306972800,,2269,4.9605263157894735
