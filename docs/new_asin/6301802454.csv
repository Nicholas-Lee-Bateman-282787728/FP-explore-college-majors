7815703,3,6301802454,"Two minor bra and panty scenes in this b-grade mystery; highly unusual for mainstream American cinema of the period. First scene takes place in the opening credits and involves a woman stripping removing her dress, the second occurs about halfway through and features a undressing to her bra, panties and stockings. Three stars to be generous.",1182816000,,343,5.142857142857143
7815704,4,6301802454,"The police have a special. If you strangle 12 pretty girls, you get a 10 year reduction in your sentence. The problem is that a 1200 year term minus 10 isn't going to help you much. Seriously, Victor is just great in this DRAGNET type police drama. It made him a star. The only complaint is that it drags a little. As far as women are concerned, Mr. Buono invented a new meaning for NECKING! This one is worth getting, and check out his other starring movie: THE MAD BUTCHER.",1088467200,,475,4.288888888888889
