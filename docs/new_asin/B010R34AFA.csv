7315926,5,B010R34AFA,Thought the girl in this was someone else so I watched it. Geared more towards young teens but was good actually. Showed that even the bully had things happen to him that made him that way but still made his choice. The wrong choice. The concept of the boy loosing his parents on 9-11 and how it affected him could have happened... we all deal with things in our own ways. Showed how some people are fake Christians and think that makes them better instead of following what God really wants. Glad the Boy who lost his parents found a true friend. She had to think for herself since her parents were the way they were.,1503792000,3,618,4.336206896551724
7315927,4,B010R34AFA,"Not your typical Christian flick - refreshing! The religious clichs were mostly missing and when quoted were inserted in such a way as to show how shallow they really are. The answers to life's real problems are seldom answered by the trite and simplistic mantras usually quoted in this genre of movie. Instead, the honest, discovering and simple faith of children could see beyond mindless religious teaching of their parents to the simplicity of choosing to believe. This was not like sitting through another sermon like most of these movies and not everything turns out roses either. Yes, it was often slow but the music was really good, surprisingly so. Stick with it. I think many will like it.  Want to ""watch"" a church sermon? Skip this movie then.",1503792000,2,755,4.852713178294573
7315928,4,B010R34AFA,"I saw several scenes right out of my junior high years. The struggles were faithfully illustrated. The big struggle, retaining ones faith in God and Jesus during turbulent interactions in junior high , was the theme of the movie; yet there is not one Church scene, showing people gathered together to hear the Word in Fellowship. The social prices one paid for befriending the ""school weirdo"" was brought out nicely. Also, showing the awful home situation that causes some kids to become violent bullies was very educational. An excellent family movie, to be followed by discussion.",1502323200,5,582,5.072916666666667
7315929,1,B010R34AFA,"This was a sad ,slow and depressing movie. The ending was not happy either. If you don't feel too good when you start watching this movie you'll feel even worse afterward. Most of the characters seemed to be phony fake christians that were not interested in helping others. The main character was beat up several times and everyone laughed and did nothing . At the end you don't know what happened to the poor boy his uncle that he lived with went to jail. I am very sorry I watched this movie and hope I can help others to make the right decision and not watch this DEPRESSING MOVIE",1501891200,4,583,4.3577981651376145
7315930,2,B010R34AFA,"Actual rating I would give is  2 1/2 stars.
It's wonderful that a girl reached out and befriended the boy that many in his school thought was weird and even retarded.
He wasn't retarded, just wasn't able to make friends.  Thus he was a loner and unhappy.
Some of his bullying is hard to watch, but I enjoyed seeing the relationship between the boy and girl develop.
The ending is a bit of a surprise, but happy.
Overall, the film is slow moving and difficult to keep watching at times.
I can't really recommend this movie.",1466899200,2,522,4.427083333333333
8722989,1,B010R34AFA,"Twice I've tried to watch this, I've only gotten through 30 minutes so far.  It's hard to watch, it's a very amateurish church produced type movie.  I am not Evangelical but I am a strong believer.  I was interested in the angel subject, so far he's only talking to the air.  I watch quite a few amateur type movies because I don't like Hollywood's violent and dark movies.  This one I can't get through, it's just bad.  Sorry",1528156800,,426,4.397435897435898
8722990,5,B010R34AFA,"Same director as the movie ""In His Steps"" ... also wrote the screenplay for this. I like this movie, except maybe not for teens but possibly tweens (10ish) to maybe 15 or so. Angels are biblical and I don't really think much about angels watching over me but according to the bible they definitely do. My only issue with this movie is that there wasn't a clear gospel message (which may make it more watchable and less preachy for some). Overall it was a good presentation. As usual in most Christian movies the acting isn't exceptional, but this is fine as far as I'm concerned. I didn't find this depressing, but the real redemption for this movie is nearer to the end. I don't want to spoil it, but it actually made me cry. A good watch with your children.",1522454400,,759,4.428571428571429

8722992,5,B010R34AFA,"This movie wasn't perfect but it was good. Definitely worth watching on prime!  The problem I had with the movie is that the there are parts, such as the angel, that are not Biblical. Mormon, perhaps, but not Christian. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the story. I did enjoy watching the movie though, and recommend it because of the moral lessons it teaches. I especially recommend it for junior and senior high school kids. They are the ones who are faced with the dilemma of the characters in the movie. Some strong lessons in it.",1519776000,2,548,4.48
8722993,5,B010R34AFA,"A beautiful movie about God and the angels! Remind me of a movie of Collateral Beauty.  Guardian angels and some higher evolved beings are among us when we are more aware of it.  Be open to it and you'll receive signs that they do exist in our world. Thank you, God! Thank you, angels!",1516752000,,285,4.2592592592592595
8722994,5,B010R34AFA,"I think that  young teens should  watch this movie..It will teach them that being a bully is not right. I like the girl  that  befriended  Tobey  and took  up  for him  when he was in harms way. While the other teens laughed and made fun of him and called him retarded. Tobey,s parents was killed on 911 and he had to go live with his uncle who mistreated  him  and was also a thief. But he had a Guardian Angel to help him and to keep him from being lonely. And that is why the Junior high school  kids called him retarded because he was constantly talking to the guardian angel that no one could see but him. Suzy the girl that became his friend showed Tobey kindness and  compassion. Unlike her fake Christian parents who punished her for helping him when she took him to her home to clean him up after the bully beat him up. while the other teens laughed and took pictures instead of trying to help him .It is a shame how Tobey was treated by these  Junior high school kids. I think that they should have explained what happened to Tobey after his uncle went to jail. I liked the ending how the angel helped Tobey and his friend.",1513382400,5,1133,4.209302325581396
8722995,3,B010R34AFA,"I like the message in this movie, but the acting and the photography is 3rd rate.",1512950400,,81,4.125
8722996,3,B010R34AFA,It does not have top notch acting so the scenes are sometimes a bit slow to play out. The story is the old theme of doing what is right. This is not a documentary on Angels but a work of fiction. It is entertaining in character development and interactions.  I would recommend this movie to my friends.,1508025600,,302,4.298245614035087
8722997,1,B010R34AFA,This was truly difficult to watch...really cringe worthy! It was so haplessly conceived and poorly acted from beginning to end I would suggest you don't waste your time.,1507248000,,169,5.071428571428571
