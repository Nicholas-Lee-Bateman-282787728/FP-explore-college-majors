7916960,5,B00003654D,"Despite the fact that I buy very few VHS videos these days, when I saw this one I just had to grab it.  What better video to watch in a Presidential election year than this satirical ""documentary"" about Pat Paulsen's satirical run for President in 1968?  Paulsen's campaign is based on double-talk, evasion (""the heart of the issue in the final analysis escapes me""), and pandering (every town he stops in is ""filled with real people, not like those phonies in California,"" and is the place where he'd ""like to settle,"" but of course he changes his tune once in California).  The comedy goes from the absurd (a fund raiser where Paulsen sells glasses of lemonade for a nickel) to the incredible (he actually gets to go inside the Capitol and address a puzzled Congress) to the delightfully silly (a fund-raising dinner where Paulsen sits and shovels food down his throat, oblivious to what's going on around him).  It's made all the more hilarious by Paulsen's sad-dog demeanor and monotone style of speaking.  It also goes to show that Presidential campaigns haven't really changed all that much over the years.  Given the choices in this year's election campaign, if Paulsen were alive today, would a Pat Paulsen presidency really be all that far-fetched?  Like a Woody Guthrie song, this video will be true and relevant forever.",1461369600,,1331,4.8628318584070795
7916961,5,B00003654D,"I grew up with The Smothers Comedy Brothers (yes, that is correct, Virginia).  Everything about that wonderful show was interesting and hysterically funny.  I truly wish the entire series on DVD.  I would buy copies for everyone I love, and several copies for personal use.  One of the best things about the show was Pat Paulson.  I have said for years, that  if Pat  Paulson were alive, I would definately write him in on the ballot.  The direction politics are going, maybe we should dig Pat up.  I have a feeling that, even, dead, he has more personality than many of our politicians do.  I laughed so hard watching this video, that my throat hurt.  Brought back some incredible memories.",1397088000,,691,4.675
7916962,5,B00003654D,"""In America any boy can grow up to become President.  Or, if he never grows up, Vice-President.""  Patrick Layton Paulson.
Pat Paulsen was hired to do editorials on ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" in 1967 and was approached by Tom and Dick with the idea of running for President in 1968.  Inspired by the pension plan than came with the office, Paulsen agreed to run.  Paulsen's campaign was based on double talk, outright lies, and unfounded attacks on his challengers, which simply proves that as a politicians Paulsen was ahead of his time.  Paulsen did not win the 1968 election, finishing behind not only Richard Nixon but Hubert Humphrey, George Wallace, and pretty much every other third party candidate on the ballot.  However, he did win an Emmy for his efforts, while the person who won the White House ended up resigning in disgrace.  So, maybe there is some justice in this world.
This 1968 CBS television special, narrated by Henry Fonda, looks at Paulsen's presidential campaign.  There are clips (too few of them to tell the truth) from Paulsen's political editorials as well as interviews and film of the candidate on the campaign trail.  You might describe this presentation as tongue in cheek if everybody was not so serious about what is going on.  Many years later Paulsen actually got on the ballot for the New Hampshire primary, but those of us who followed his career, both on and off the campaign trail, remember that first run for the White House with a special fondness.  This documentary is not for rediscovering Pat Paulsen; it is for those of us who want to rekindle our memories of the man and his comedy.",1030752000,10,1638,4.773049645390071
7916963,5,B00003654D,"Ah, those were the days! We were *on* to something then, Pat Paulsen was in particular. I voted for him, you know. I knew it wouldn't get anywhere, but he was the only candidate that made any sense. The election started getting away from us way back then. It was the peak of sixties radical activism that actually made it to mainstream media before it actually got taken off the air. With all the garbage that makes it to TV these days, it makes an interesting point that Pat Paulsen's editorial commentary, that utilized no sex or violence, was considered ""not ready for prime time."" It's heartbreakingly sad that we don't hear from him anymore. I, for one, miss him very much...and the Smothers Brothers, too.",998092800,10,711,4.650793650793651
7916964,5,B00003654D,"A satirical look at politics, its humor comes from its closeness to actual campaigns. As Pat says, ""Just change a few names and the same thing is going  on today."" Narrated by Henry Fonda, this highly acclaimed TV  show will keep you laughing. (This video was one of three American TV shows  taken by a Russian delegation back to Russia in 1972. Nobody knows why, but  pat assumed this contributed to the fall of Communism.)",945993600,,424,4.613333333333333
