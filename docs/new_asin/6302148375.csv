430433,3,6302148375,"There is a certain French farcical charm, however calculated, about director Peter Bogdanovich's 1981 urban valentine to romantic entanglements in Manhattan; but just released on DVD a quarter-century later, the film still feels half-baked in execution. Perhaps because Bogdanovich has too innate a familiarity with Hollywood's golden era, there is just too much pastiche and not enough depth to the shenanigans of three private eyes, their put-upon boss and the various women with whom they intertwine most predictably. The characters come in and out of this omnibus tale like Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" and Jean Renoir's ""Rules of the Game"", but the results are not nearly as resonant.

Unfortunately, the movie was jinxed immediately when co-star Dorothy Stratten, who became romantically involved with Bogdanovich during filming, was infamously murdered by her husband right after its completion. If the film was meant as the director's launching pad for Stratten as he did previously for Cybill Shepherd in ""The Last Picture Show"", he is only partially successful this time as the pretty starlet makes a comparatively modest impression as Dolores, the innocent object of obsession for bumbling detective Charles. These two are part of a larger ensemble, which includes Arthur, a long-haired shamus constantly on roller skates, and John, the veteran investigator who finds himself drawn to Angela Niotes, the possibly philandering wife of an Italian industrialist.

Bogdanovich had the good fortune of casting Audrey Hepburn, in her last feature film starring role, as Angela. Even though her story does not even get going until an hour into the movie, a fiftyish Hepburn looks radiantly stylish and is the epitome of resigned grace as an unhappily married woman. In an apparent nod to Bogie, Ben Gazzara performs too close to the vest as world-weary John, while a young, bespectacled John Ritter seems to regale in all his slapstick business as the smitten Charles. Less successful are Blaine Novak as the overly hip Arthur, model Patti Hansen (long since married to Rolling Stone Keith Richards) as bromide-spouting taxi driver ""Sam"", and a particularly unctuous Colleen Camp as motor-mouthed country singer Christy Miller insinuating herself into everyone else's lives.

Much like a Jacques Demy film (""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" comes immediately to mind), the plot unfolds after a long wordless introduction, and character motivations get filled in on an as-needed basis until the film gains some gravitas and then whimpers away. On the DVD's main extra, Bogdanovich states emphatically that this is the favorite of his films in an interview conducted with director Wes Anderson, who also admires the film (as does Quentin Tarantino, who makes it one of his top ten in ""Halliwell's Top 1000"" book). The details of the location shooting are interesting, as much was done on a modest scale with a minimum of extras, and Bogdanovich gratefully does not belabor the sensationalistic aspects of Stratten's death. He also provides a solid commentary track, and the print transfer on the DVD is relatively clean. I'm not sure the film is completely worthy of rediscovery in a vaunted 25th Anniversary Edition except for Hepburn's near-valedictory work and any lingering curiosity about Stratten.",1161561600,16,3301,5.344230769230769
430434,5,6302148375,"I think the picture is a neglected masterpiece,  a lovely bittersweet romantic postcard to a New York pretty nearly gone now, shot stunningly by Robby Mueller (who also shot Bogdanovich's great SAINT JACK in a similar seat-of-the-pants style).  The good news is that the picture on this dvd looks excellent, and the film is actually the original theatrical version (there was a misbegotten director's cut floating around for awhile that took a scene from the middle and stuck it at the beginning for no good reason) WITH additional footage in one sequence that is quite funny.  So it takes all the good stuff added to the ""director's cut"" but keeps the original's superior sequencing.

The DVD also has a conversation between Peter Bogdanovich, the director with young director Wes Anderson, whose quite a fan of the film, plus a commentary.  For fans of this film, you couldn't do better than this.",1161043200,26,899,4.927152317880795
430435,3,6302148375,"Dorothy Stratten and Patty Hansen are stunning in their beauty and the movie is worth seeing just to look at them! There is no plot at all as far as I can tell. Having lived in NYC  at that time it was nice to see the benign and fun side of NYC- which was partly true but under-publicized- during an era of rampant crime, NYC's  near bankruptcy,riots, blackouts, flight of jobs and the middle class and other depressing events. Still, life went on and nice things happened too,

  I have never seen a movie that glamorizes smoking cigarettes as does this movie. Every happy, sexy, fun line or action in the movie is paired with lighting, inhaling or sharing a cigarette. I wonder if the tobacco companies had a hand in this and also is any of the many easily influenced teens of that day picked up the habit as a result.",1148688000,3,820,4.368421052631579
430436,4,6302148375,"New York City became quite a tiresome choice for movie backgrounds a long time ago (how many times can a moviegoer look at Times Square and the fancy, fast moving flashy signs and faster moving video screens that blind you in person and on the screen without rolling your eyes?).  It's not the only city in this country to film a movie (and the city isn't that nice to look at).

With that gripe aside, I didn't care about NYC as the background because I was too interested in checking out Dorothy Stratten's performance ... and I was not disappointed.

Curse that sorry excuse for a husband of Dorothy's that he decided to take the life of someone who had a lot of acting potential.  While her role was a bit empty, she handled it well and it made me sad to see her everytime she was on-screen, knowing what fate had in store for her when filming ended.  Sadder yet is the fact that she never got to see the fruits of her labor.

As degrading as Playboy is to women, one of the only good things that magazine ever gave the world was Dorothy Stratten, if just for a little while.  She'll forever be young and beautiful but what an undeveloped talent that was wasted!  (I prefer her over these overexposed and very undertalented starlets of today!)

Highly recommended.",1127433600,9,1268,4.454545454545454
430437,4,6302148375,"This film is perfectly charming all the way through.  There's lots of great talent in the star-studded cast and the whole effect is one of a charming fairy tale with wit and humor.  The story is just a little bit far-out when private investigators break with their professional code and actually meet and fall in love with the people they are hired to watch.  But putting that on one side, this is a lovely story that shows us a charming side of New York.  This film rises to the delighful level that one rarely sees in films set in New York.  Too many wallow in the 'mean streets' with guns and violence, but this one is a story about people who enjoy the city and move seamlessly through it, jumping from taxi to taxi arriving for meetings and liasons so smoothly. John Ritter shows us he is a master craftsman at being the buffoon and comes up with an assortment of fients, starts and gaffs to lighten the story. Ben Gazzara shows a charmingly romantic side of him, Audrey Hepburn is the masterful actress she always was. The street scenes are entirely authentic and lend credibility to the film.  Nice acting, smooth cutting and humorous sub-plots are there too, and these make it all the more real. Dorothy Stratten glows with charm and beauty and is absolutely captivating.  Peter Bogdanovich has posed and illuminated her well and she carries herself with confidence.  What a charming legacy to leave behind is this film.  How sad she was not given the opportunity to do more.
I put this film on whenever I want to be put in a good mood, and visit The City, and the film never fails to show me additional things each time I see it.  What a gem",1015718400,77,1650,4.47
430438,4,6302148375,"Over the years a cult has grown up around this movie.  And most of it centered around the murder of co-star Dorothy Stratten, who it must be pointed out is immensely appealing here.  One can only wonder what lay ahead for her had she lived.  It's obvious that Bogdanovich(her real-life fiance) tried to turn this movie into a valentine to her.  It's just too bad he nearly lost his shirt in the process, because this is certainly a very charming picture.
But it could also be argued that charm is this film's selling point since it offers very little by way of a script.  It moves along rather aimlessly from one story to the next, and for a comedy there really aren't all that many laughs to be had.  Still, I completely enjoyed this movie.  The charm and appeal of all the players more than made up for any shortcomings in the script.  Stratten, like I said is breathtaking here and it's certainly no stretch of the imagination why John Ritter, playing the somewhat addled detective assigned to follow her would take more than a professional interest in his work(In an ugly parallel to the film Stratten's real-life estranged husband had her followed in a similar fashion in the weeks leading up to her death).  Patti Hansen and Colleen Camp are both great-looking and likeable although Camp's over-the-top character can be grating at times.  Audrey Hepburn brings her usual touch of class, as well as a lot of warmth to her part.  Ben Gazzara shows a softer, more sensitive side that we rarely get to see.  And John Ritter proves that with the right director he can be a comic force to be reckoned with.
An added bonus.  The cinematography is top-drawer.  New York has  never looked so good.
The verdict?  Yours to make, really.  Just lie back, put your brain and neutral and enjoy.  There are a lot worse ways to kill a couple of hours.  Enjoy.",1008201600,10,1848,4.579268292682927
430439,5,6302148375,"The last credit in this film explains its appeal - - Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed. A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter  Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street,  Greenwich Avenue - not Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the  Plaza, the Roxy, and City Limits which was a country & western club -  not a Tex-Mex joint). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast  clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly  communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode  to Dorothy Stratten, it was also one of Audrey Hepburn's last appearances  on-screen (if not THE last) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen.

430440,2,6302148375,"The most surprising thing about Peter Bogdanovich's rarely-screened comedy ""They All Laughed"" is that it contains almost no discernible plot; three male detectives, (including John Ritter!! and Ben Gazzara)  spend two hours simply trailing a series of beautiful women around New York  City. The purpose of their pursuits is never revealed. For better or worse,  Bogdanovich seems wrapped up in the idea of pursuing women, but this alone  isn't enough to sustain a feature-length film. Oddly, the picture is laced  with a country & western soundtrack. Character actress Colleen Camp  (incredibly sexy here) sings a few c&w numbers at a Tex-Mex  club...arguably, these musical snippets make the film worth seeing. Another  reason to catch this picture is the presence of onetime Playboy playmate  Dorothy Stratten (Bogdanovich's lover at the time of shooting) who was  murdered by husband Paul Snider shortly after the film's release and became  the subject of Bob Fosse's film ""Star 80"" (1983). ""They All  Laughed"" was the only non-snuff, non-exploitation feature Stratten  ever completed. In the early 1970's, Bogdanovich was hailed as the  ""new Orson Welles""; sadly, ""They All Laughed"" became  his fourth or fifth flop in a consecutive string of failures including  ""Daisy Miller"" and ""At Long Last Love.""",927072000,4,1306,5.359605911330049

John Ritter does a fine job in a supporting role while he was big star on the television sitcom, ""Three's Company."" Other cast members include Patti Hansen, Colleen Camp, Blaine Novak, Glenn Scarpelli, and Elizabeth Pena too.

After watching this film, there is a conversation with the film's director, Peter Bogdanovich, on the film's silver anniversary in 2006. Peter's interview explains how he was influenced by other film directors for this project. He also explained how he wanted to film in New York City and how he wanted to work with Hepburn.

430552,3,6302148375,"While the directing and writing suffered in this light hearted comedy romp that is just a tad too long.  There are plenty of stars and backstories for your enjoyment behind the movie.  The basic plot is about three lousy detectives that are suppose to be trailing some wives to catch them fooling around on their husbands.  Instead they get romantically involved with them themselves.  The movie is filmed in Manhattan.  Top billing goes to Ben Gazzara and Audrey Hepburn who reportedly had a fling in the 70's.  This was Audrey's last starring feature on the big screen.  And as attractive as she was when she was young, and she didn't look bad then either, she was no match for Dorothy Stratten, Patti Hansen and Colleen Camp.  This also was the last film for Dorothy Stratten as she was killed by her jealous husband soon after.  The bad press probably helped kill the box office too.  It was great to see the young, thin Colleen Camp and was pleasantly surprised by her singing.  Not a great flick, but an interesting watch for some.",1420934400,2,1037,4.642857142857143

There is also some Sinatra, Armstrong and other Jazz that provides good contrast to the country stuff.  The real prize however is the half dozen songs that Colleen Camp performs with the Manhattan Cowboys (a smoking hot band led by the great pianist Earle Poole Ball).

First, the cast is exceptional, with two clear standouts.  John Ritter was marvelous here, the clear embodiment of physical comedy perfection.

It also gives the audience a change to see Audrey's face on screen, which never disappoints.  But that's about it. To be blunt, the movie isn't worth your time or money.

430637,4,6302148375,"This is a nice little movie though at times, it doesn't feel much like a movie. You don't get a sense of actors playing characters as much as actors playing themselves on screen. The actors seem so loose and carefree in some scenes even though you don't get a sense that the characters would be loose and carefree in the scene. I get this same sense in some of Wim Wender's later movies like Until The End of the World and Faraway, So Close. This is unfortunate because it is a great ensemble cast. Having this feeling ruins the dramatic aspects of the story, and the story is an issue with this movie too because it's deliberately loose. The movie does have its moments which really work and most of them feature Audrey Hepburn in one of her final films.

While the movie isn't the best Bogdanovich ever made the DVD is excellent because this movie needs alot of real life backstory to make it more enjoyable. Having Peter Bogdanovich's commentary helps the viewing of this 2 hour long movie immensely. There is an inside joke and subtleties completely missed in practically scene.

It also helps that he explains the copious amount of Country and Western music in a movie set exclusively in New York City. It is hard to believe that Country music was ever popular in New York but it was during the late summer early fall of 1980. I am guessing the musical tastes of New Yorkers was so out of whack after disco died that they literally gravitated toward anything.

Bogdanovich says in the commentary that he often gave the script to the actors on the day they were shooting. That explains why the story is a little slow moving at times. It doesn't help the pacing or the coherence of the plot if you are flying by the seat of your pants with the storyline that much. Much of the ending feels thrown together as well. The only part of the ending that feels as though it was planned involves the storyline between the Gazzara and Hepburn characters.

The commentary has it's poignant moments as well. Peter Bogdanovich sounds as though he is on the brink of tears in the last scene filmed with Dorothy Stratten. Who could blame him?",1373673600,3,2131,4.527272727272727

Audrey Hepburn's son, Sean Ferrer also appears in the movie in a supporting role. Other than that and the fact that Audrey Hepburn is always elegant and delightful to watch, the movie is slow, tortuous, nothing but silly slapstick humor. John Ritter and Ben Gazarra do have their moments, but otherwise it was painful. Awful! Awful! Awful!

All the action takes place in a dated NYC with cars and clothes to match.

Audrey Hepburn was beautiful, as always. Otherwise, you need to love total nonsense more than I do. Apparently lots of people disagree with me.

You almost can't help loving this movie even though its transparent ideological slant (infidelity isn't really wrong when it leads misunderstood spouses to true love) is rendered a bit creepy by the lens of Bogdanovich's real-life affair with Stratton (which arguably contributed to her murder).  But despite Bogdanovich's self-serving cinematic rationalizations for seducing and manipulating a vulnerable beauty, the performances save the day; everyone from seasoned actors Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazarra, to future star John Ritter, to emerging talents like Patti Hansen and Blaine Novak (and the luminous Stratton) are fabulous in their understated grace and charm.

430704,5,6302148375,"""THEY ALL LAUGHED"" is a wonderful romantic comedy about Manhattan detectives who fall for the women they are following.  Peter Bogdanovich directed this 1981 movie that stars Audrey Hepburn (her last lead role), Ben Gazzara (after his and Audrey's affair had ended), John Ritter, and Dorothy Stratten (her one and only starring role in a movie).  Colleen Camp plays a delightful country-western singer.  Filmed entirely on the island of Manhattan gives you a pre-9-11 sense of big city life.  This DVD also has a commentary track with the director reminiscing about the movie.  The soundtrack features Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, and a great roller-skating scene featuring ""Sing, Sing, Sing.""  ENJOY!",1235692800,4,700,5.318181818181818
430705,4,6302148375,"Whether the story line makes any sense at all is irrelevant. This movie features the last appearances of Dorothy Stratten and Audrey Hepburn. For no other reason, that makes it worth the price of admission. Then add to that appearances by John Ritter and Ben Gazzara and you have some top actors doing the best they could with the script. I am also a Colleen Camp fan and as a songwriter enjoyed hearing her sing. She is a very good actress who is not well known. Believe it or not Colleen has been involved with more than 80 films in her career. This film is basically a showcase and was supposed to help Dorothy breakout into some legitimate acting roles. Peter had a very active interest in Dorothy to say the least. As it turned out, the picture is not only a fun experience to watch but more than that it is an historical document. The tragedy of Dorothy's death and the timing of it damaged the film's distribution. Although now it is somewhat dated the work of some fine actors is preserved and we get to see Dorothy one more time. Audrey Hepburn was and forever is one of the world's most beautiful women. Supposedly she had had an affair with Ben Gazzara during the filming of Bloodline in 1979.  Their re-uniting was also a bittersweet moment because the scenes they shared were particularly poignant. It is a shame that the film never really had a national promotional campaign behind it and consequently only had a limited release. But those of us who know the film and appreciate it for it's own beauty and grace as well as comedic sense, are very pleased that it is now available on DVD and no longer need to worry about our well worn VHS copies.

430756,4,6302148375,"Peter Bogdanovich co-wrote the screenplay, directed and eventually funded the release of this romantic comedy which featured the acting debut of Dorothy Stratten.

But the August 1980 death of Stratten - at age 20 - in a murder/suicide perpetrated by her estranged husband made studios leery on releasing the movie. Though Bogdanovich saw the project through to its cinematic release, it proved to be a box office failure.

The plot surrounds three private detectives who are hired to investigate two women for possible infidelity. That the detectives end up romantically pursuing the duo just adds to the intrigue...and that the women ultimately turn the tables on the men is pure New Hollywood.

John Ritter (Detective John Rutledge) is Stratten's (Dolores Martin) ""pursuer"" and both bring an energetic, fun aspect to their roles. Detective John Russo (Ben Gazzara) is in hot pursuit of Angela Niotes (Audrey Hepburn), the wife of a European multi-millionaire,  but he gets an assist from his colleague - Detective Arthur Brodsky (Blaine Novak) - as things get more and more complicated.

With New York City as the backdrop, it is a neat exploration into trust, the game of love and the pursuit of real happiness. The sadness is in the untimely death of Stratten, but it does not diminish her performance or the wittiness of the film.",1230508800,3,1336,5.054545454545455

You see, when a conversation is struck up in this movie it moves at very rapid speed, with tons of pretentious and inconsequential banter...and all mumbled. Too bad one will never understand it without ENGLISH subtitles. The biggest joke is you can select French and Spanish subtitles.

It's a variation on the caper movie, which genre is usually highly predictable and not very realistic. That doesn't mean caper movies aren't fun, though!

As far as talent goes, it isn't exactly a level playing field. Gazarra and Hepburn are heavyweight champs on a visit to a high school gym, and they certainly didn't have to work hard. Ritter is amazingly natural with his very believable bumbling; not many actors can handle the physical side of comedy as well. Novak's Arthur came across as well as a cool New Yorker who'd be fun to hand with; haven' seen him anything else, so can't say if he was acting or just being himself. Something about Patti Hansen's performance makes me wish her part had been beefed up a bit. Colleen Camp's singing wasn't bad, but her performance wasn't exactly scintillating. The rest of the girls... well, they're decorative, for the most part. Bogdanovich's daughters... the less said, the better.

Even so, the movie itself is fun, and it's long been a favorite of mine. If you're interested in other movies in the genre, try Rough Cut with Burt Reynolds.",1204070400,2,1227,4.755868544600939
430759,1,6302148375,"If you're not a film buff, then this film has zero entertainment value. Otherwise, I enjoyed the generous cinematic helpings of New York City--really wonderful stuff--including views out of not-so-clean windows during interior shots. I've rarely seen the Statue of Liberty at such a distance, sharing the horizon with docks and construction cranes. There's a lot going on here connected to trivia (but not a lot going on in the film itself or with the script, which is simply awful). What's going on with the trivia? This is Audrey Hepburn's last feature film (an easy payday for her ((I mean, what Hepburn did in the film is what I did yesterday when I walked to the corner and back)) but at least she didn't embarrass herself); the fact that ""They All Laughed"" is a poignant film record of the soon-to-be murdered Playboy Bunny Dorothy Stratten; John Ritter at work (during the height of his ""Three's Company"" fame); the pairing of fellow actors and former lovers, Ben Gazzara and Audrey Hepburn; the fact that the director was having an affair with Dorothy Stratten; the fact that the director, after Stratten's murder, bought the negative to the film and paid for its distribution in theaters; the fact that it bombed terribly due to the public's negative reaction to the scandal of the off-screen love triangle; the fact that this film ended the director's career--not as a filmmaker but--as one of Hollywood's powerhouse directors. Finito. Pretty interesting trivia for a single film. One of the two writers that created this mess also acts and turns in a pretty good performance as a doofus hipster. Furthermore, this movie is based on two previous films, both entitled, ""L'Ronde,"" which were based on an 1897 play, if my facts are correct. 1970s supermodel Patti Hansen fights a valiant but losing battle with her cab driver's insipid character and stupid lines. Every time Ben Gazzara appeared on screen I felt the impulse to reach for an inhaler as his presence sucked the air out of my small room. John Ritter's then-charming physical comedy talents are over-used and not to good effect: Oops! He tripped (again!) Ohhh! I can't believe he bumped into that table! (Boy, I didn't see THAT coming!)...Etc. The story becomes so tedious--what with all the bumping-into's, walking, stalking, hiding, peeking, signaling--that during one of the interminable crossing-the-street scenes I prayed that John Ritter, Blaine Novak and Ben Gazzara, would be creamed by a New York City bus! Oh! I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack. That's a whole separate disaster. Several times I took off my headphones and looked around to see if someone else had turned on a stereo. Sometimes the soundtrack was loud--in the foreground above the dialogue. Sometimes it was low--in the background. Sometimes there was no music. Sometimes there were back-to-back songs. The Director's Playlist! And all the songs had lyrics, and those lyrics were intended to underscore a theme that was being founded at that moment. Sometimes it was Frank Sinatra. Sometimes it was Johnny Cash. Halfway through the movie Frank Sinatra starts crooning, ""They all laughed...."" Brilliant! I get it! This movie really IS a stinker! Honestly, it would have been more entertaining (and more enlightening) had the director appeared at these critical junctures holding white poster board displaying a message written in MagicMarker: ""See this couple? See how they're reacting to each other? This will become important later. Now, back to my film."" I knew what to expect with this movie so I watched it off and on over the course of a weekend while going through boxes of papers. Otherwise I never would have forgiven myself for the waste of time.

He just wallked around with a smirk on his face and all the women he knew were supposedly smitten with him.  He was so miscast in that role. He is a short man and not very masculine.  It is hard to imagine women swooning over him.  I regret having wasted my time watching this.

430765,3,6302148375,"They All Laughed is one of those movies that seems a great idea on paper, but what ends up on the screen just doesnt quite jell. A story about a trio of NY private eyes who fall for their ""prey"" seems fraught with posssibilities, but the story just never takes off anywhere. The movie just ambles along (quite pleasantly) without much direction. It allmost seems deliberately underwritten. Characters are thinly sketched, and we find out little about them or given much reason to care what happens to them. That is a shame, because the film has a great visual look (beautiful photography by Robby Mueller) and NY is as big a star in the movie as any of the actors and seldom has looked better. Top billed Audrey Hepburn is allmost criminally underused here in her last starring movie role, she has probably the least screen time of any of the principal players and its asking a lot of the viewer to buy that she'd risk having a fling with Ben Gazzara, as the man hired to keep an eye on her (it doesnt help that Gazzara has all the appeal here of a block of ice!). Likewise, Dorothy Stratten isn't given much reason to fall for goofball John Ritter who is her stalker. If you can get past all that illogic, the movie is fun up to a point. A pleasant trifle, that could have been so much more with a better script. A film like Nashville also had a large cast (a much bigger one), yet managed to involve us with characters that seemed real and fleshed out. Here, we never really get to know anyone well, particularly the women. There are laughs (primarily from klutzy Ritter, frenetic Colleen Camp and womanizing Blaine Novak who's too busy propositioning women to fall for anyone); but the story really doesnt go anywhere. Bogdanovich seems to be aiming for a Gallic romantic farce, but the wit and charm to sustain the story just isn't there. From a girl watching point of view, I give this an A. Hepburn looks like a million bucks, Stratten has a luminescent out of this world quality and Patti Hansen has to be the sexiest cab driver in the Big Apple. But from an entertainment standpoint, I give it a C+. Seen 25 years later the film is a nice snapshot of NYC at a moment in time (before AIDS changed everything) but has a haunting quality as so many of the principals (Stratten; Hepburn; Ritter) died way before their time. There is a nice interview with Bogdanovich included. The movie never found its way into much of a release at the time due to much bad luck, but maybe it will have a second life for home viewers.",1162857600,6,2522,4.449244060475162
