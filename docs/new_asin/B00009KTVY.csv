I would recommend this book to anyone wants to learn guitar. It makes a great gift too.",1350691200,5,335,4.25
7991017,5,B00009KTVY,I am a beginner at playing the guitar and have a few learning books and DVDs that go with them. Some are hard to understand. Absolute Beginners Guitar is very simple to use and is the best one I have tried to learn with. It was the best learning book for me. Easy DVD goes step by step with the book with backup CD music that goes along with what you learn.  I wish I had started with this guitar learning course first. It's the best I have tried to learn with.,1214697600,21,461,4.010869565217392
