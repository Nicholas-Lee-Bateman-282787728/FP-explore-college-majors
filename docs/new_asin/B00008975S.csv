Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.

7980125,4,B00008975S,"In fact, Gene Autry was a huge favourite outside the USA too--there are Autry fans all over the world, even into the 21st century. From 1935 to 1953, except for during World War II when he signed up to serve his country, Gene starred in a series of western movies that delighted young and old. His films for Republic Pictures between 1935 and 1946, blended action, comedy, music and even a little romance--a combination that many found irresistable and made ""The Singing Cowboy"" a major box office star. In 1946, Gene signed on with Columbia, making films that still made good use of his musical talent, but that were more mature, with stronger plot-lines.
Of course, ""Rovin' Tumbleweeds"" is a Republic production, and while it is not in a class with ""South of the Border"", ""Goldmine in the Sky"" or ""Colorado Sunset"" for example, it is still very enjoyable. The plot involves desperate farmers, trying to hold on to their land, and crooked politicians who only want to line their own pockets--well, some things don't change much, do they ? Gene tries to help the farmers by going to Washington, where he encounters nothing but red tape. Of course, after some good songs--and a few punches--Gene gives us the inevitable happy ending. There are good supporting performances from Douglass Dumbrille, as the very ""hissable"" villain, and William Farnum as an old Senator.
As a life-long Autry fan, I am delighted to see that some of Gene's classic films are appearing on DVD. The picture quality is excellent. Thanks to Image more Autry titles are coming out, and I hope that this continues. My only question is that, in the case of Hopalong Cassidy, Image is including two titles per DVD--for Gene Autry, we only get one. Gene's films are not lengthy ( except for a few Columbias )--why not have two Autry films on each disc ?
Why was Gene Autry so popular ? Other movie cowboys were taller, handsomer, better actors, more convincing in action scenes etc.
Apart from possessing a singing voice that sold millions of records, my view is that people just loved Gene's personality--friendly, unpretentious yet charismatic. People simply liked the man, and what he represented. A small boy in England first saw Gene on the ""Silver Screen"" many years ago and immediately became a fan--I still am !",1051747200,5,2288,4.824427480916031
