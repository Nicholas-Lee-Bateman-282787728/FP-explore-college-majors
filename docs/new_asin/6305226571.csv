I just want to indicate that I have seen and compared two of the releases of Nothing Sacred on DVD and the Marengo version, despite having problems, is superior to the Alpha release in both picture and sound.  I can't speak for other versions.  The Alpha Video print seems to be the most popular version of this movie that is purchased here at Amazon but it is inferior to the Marengo DVD of Nothing Sacred/A Star is Born.  I can only hope that perhaps a Criterion or Kino version will come out soon.  There is still a lot of room for improvement.",1257897600,5,599,4.3125

992762,5,6305226571,"This film classic takes cynicism to new heights in fun fashion as Carole Lombard gives a truly wonderful performance as a girl from a small town in Vermont who becomes the toast of New York, thanks to jaded reporter Fredric March, and a bad medical diagnosis from her pal Charles Winninger. David O. Selznick produced and William A. Wellman directed what is not only a screen classic, but one of the finest moments in Carole Lombard's career.

Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay from a story by James H. Street and it is both a funny and cynical take on the newspaper business and the American public. Oscar Levant wrote the score and Raymond Scott and his Quintett add some swing music. Fredric March and Carole Lombard have a chemistry that makes this one a lot of fun.

Fredrick March is Wally Cook, a star reporter for the ""New York Morning Star"" who is demoted to the obituary page when his paper is taken for a free ride by a man passing himself off as a Sultan. When he turns out to be only a bootblack, Cook feels the heat from his boss, Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly). Connolly is fine as the editor with egg on his face. Stone has a heart, but only if you're willing to blast for it!

Wally sees a chance to get back in Oliver's good graces when he spots a short story about a young girl from the small town of Warsaw, Vermont, who has been diagnosed with radium poisoning and has only a short time to live. He heads for Warsaw to bring back, and exploit, Hazel Flagg, cut down in her prime.

Carole Lombard is, of course, Hazel Flagg. The reason Hazel is crying isn't because she's dying, but rather because Dr. Enoch Downer (Charles Winninger) has just told Hazel he made a mistake and she's going to have to remain in Warsaw after all. Hazel was going to use the 200 dollars you get from dying in Warsaw to see the world, and get out of the small town. Winninger is a hoot as the doctor who drinks his poison out of a black jug and is still upset with not winning an essay contest in Wally's paper.

When Wally shows up and wants to take Hazel back to New York, she sees her chance to get out, and talks her friend Enoch into going with her under the ruse that she really is dying. As she tells Enoch: ""It's startling to be brought to life twice, and each time in Warsaw!"" Once they travel by plane to New York, which is a new experience for both Hazel and Enoch, the real fun begins.

Lombard is sweet and adorable as Hazel lives it up like she has no tomorrows, and thanks to a series of stories by Wally, becomes the toast of New York. Wally begins to feel bad, however, and finds himself falling for Hazel. There is a romantic scene as they go sailing where just gazing upon the lovely Lombard will take your breath away. Hazel is beginning to fall for Wally as well, and starting to feel bad about the charade. Hazel is hilarious as she gets plastered at a casino and passes out before the devoted crowd. The cynicism of Ben Hecht's script really shines when Oliver, standing over Hazel, inquires from Wally about her condition: ""Don't spare my feelings. We go to press in 15 minutes."" There are many such moments contrasted against the sweetness of Hazel Flagg.

Once a team of real doctors are brought in to examine Hazel, the gig is up. Hazel loves Wally and decides to fake her suicide with Enoch's help in order to save his career. Wally doesn't care that it was all fake, however, and in a rush to save her, ends up knocking her in the river where he almost drowns himself, because he can't swim. Lombard in a fireman's hat and wet clothes will leave no doubt that she was one of the screen's most beautiful actresses, as well as one of its finest comedians.

There is a hilarious fight scene between Wally and Hazel as he tries to give her symptoms of pnemonia that has a romantic glow despite the cynicism involved. The only way to make things work for both Hazel and the paper, however, is for her to go away alone to die. Wally may have to leave also if he wants to join her on the cruise to ""death"" she's taking with Enoch.

This was a film originally in early technicolor. Prints vary as to color quality, none being anything to write home about. All are watchable, however, and this film is perhaps best enjoyed if you turn off the color and simply watch it in glorious black and white. Lombard would give her life for her country on an Indiana war bond tour and this film is a shining example of the magic she left behind. You do not want to miss it.",1248652800,3,4478,4.321428571428571
992763,4,6305226571,"The editorial comment is just a teensy off - the movie it's describing is ""A Star Is Born,"" not ""Nothing Sacred"" as stated.  That said, let me say that this double feature from Marengo is a happy little surprise.  Criterion quality being a 10 and Madacy being, well, a 1, I'm giving Marengo a good solid 7 for overall quality.

Nowadays, everybody and their dog's company is offering old movies on DVD.  With the results you'd expect.  Having spent about a bazillion bucks on old movies, I learned the hard way that you generally get what you pay for.  So, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered Marengo's double feature of ""Nothing Sacred"" and ""A Star Is Born.""  Imagine my delight when it turned out to be a terrific bargain.

Both movies are Selznick productions made in 1937, both directed by William Wellman and both are technicolor starring vehicles for Frederick March.  March's leading ladies are respectively Carole Lombard and Janet Gaynor.

""Nothing Sacred,"" co-starring Lombard, is a hilarious screwball comedy about fibbing, fraud and all the attendant tangle-ups.  The ensemble cast plays it broadly and brilliantly.  Hazel Flagg (Lombard) has been diagnosed with radium poisoning (fatal) by the local doc.  But early on, Doc admits to her that she's OK after all - says he'd got so he was seeing radium poisoning everywhere.  Hazel's a little disappointed.  Not much excitement in a small New England burg and it was fun being the center of attention.  Meanwhile, a reporter (March) from a big New York paper has arrived to do a human interest story on Flagg.  He's so taken with her ""bravery"" in the face of impending death that he offers her a fabulous all-expenses-paid trip to New York to do it up right before the bitter end.  They know it's wrong, but Hazel and Doc convince themselves that after all they've been through they're entitled.  So, off they go, Hazel becoming the next New York flavor of the month.  The movie's a great romp, skewering hypocrisy, affectation, sham and pretense, sparing ""Nothing Sacred.""

""A Star Is Born,"" co-starring Gaynor, is a well made drama that was rather overshadowed by the Judy Garland/James Mason remake of 1954.  But this picture has merit because of the fine performances of the cast and Wellman's directorial touch.  Janet Gaynor plays Esther Blodgett, an average kid who wants to be in the movies, so her loving granny subsidizes the trip out to Hollywood with her funeral money.  Esther meets top actor Norman Maine (March) by accident while waitressing at a party and it's through him that she eventually gets her toehold in the industry.  They fall in love, marry and live ""happily"" ever after.  As Esther's star rises, Norman's becomes eclipsed and he succumbs to alchoholism.  There's hypocrisy, affectation, sham and pretense in this movie, too, framed within the story of the movie industry itself.  However, instead of fun and satire, we find tragedy and sorrow.

Gaynor had a meteoric rise in silents and in fact became the recipient of the first Oscar for best actress in 1929.  She was at the top of her game in this piece, receiving the nomination again for best actress, but her career abruptly ended after just two more pictures, eerily echoing the theme of ""A Star Is Born.""

So, I recommend you get this DVD, kids.  The price is right.  The quality's surprisingly good and the stories are ideal vehicles for the stars and director.  A jug of root beer, a tub of popcorn and thee...",1215388800,8,3464,4.825127334465195

992766,3,6305226571,"A film that is not THAT important. It is not even very entertaining. But it raises an important question about journalism. A journalist is only aiming, according to this film, at increasing the circulation of his paper no matter how. Here this policy is entirely based on a fake event. It is overdramatized and it is super-effective in New York. Millions of people react to the story in the most sentimental and sympathetic way. And they cannot be moved from their support of the poor dying girl that is presented in this story. It is a complete sham. And yet it works. This raises the question of the responsibility of the journalist and the conclusion is alas very negative. Journalists are opportunists.

Yet, despite all these little nerdy film nuggets, this comedy is hilarious and beyond its underlying themes of corruption and dishonesty.

Asking his boss for one last chance, he finds a story about a woman Hazel (Carol Lombard) who is dying of radium poisoning. Quickly swept up by all the media attention and the public outpouring of sympathy, Hazel cannot find it in herself to reveal the truth that she is not really dying of anything at all. The newspaper eats up all of the fame and hype surrounding Hazel's illness and it becomes a moral question that Hazel must face.

Back before cable TV, if you wanted to watch an on-the-air TV station that was located quite far away, you got a very grainy TV picture.  That's exactly how this DVD looks.

I guess I can't fault the seller because I ordered a new DVD.  I can't expect the seller to open a new DVD and watch it for a few seconds.  The actual DVD itself arrived new and in perfect physical condition.

But the manufacturer is very definitely responsible.  There's no way that they didn't know about the horrible picture!

One more thing:  This DVD doesn't come in a regular DVD jewel case.  It comes in a thin cardboard sleeve.  That, in itself,

992857,1,6305226571,"Last week I gave away an Electrolux  vacuum cleaner.  It was purchased by my mother in New Jersey in 1968.  It cleaned our homes in New Jersey and Florida for 15 years, and it is still functioning perfectly.  I only gave it away because today's lightweight vacs are much easier to tote.  I tell this story because there was a time in this country when companies took pride in their products and ripping consumers off was unheard of, or at the very least, it seldom occurred.  But the years have passed and companies don't care about quality anymore.  Now it's all about getting top dollar for inferior products that promise you everything and deliver nothing.  Such is the case with Kino's The Selznick Collection.  All five films in this boxed set claim the following:  MASTERED IN HD FROM AN ORIGINAL NITRATE 35MM PRINT PRESERVED BY THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE MOTION PICTURE DEPARTMENT.  If this is actually true I am willing to eat all five DVDs and then the cardboard box itself.  All five films are of substandard quality, some of them so awful that they are barely viewable.  The most disastrous of them all is BIRD OF PARADISE, with the lovely Dolores del Rio, which is not only marred by visuals worthy of bad public domain piracy but is also afflicted with a distortion of its soundtrack from the very beginning of the film, making the dialog unintelligible, to say nothing about Max Steiner's fabulous score, which is distorted beyond recognition.  I have seen public domain copies of this film which are superior to this absolute merde Kino claims came from an original nitrate negative.  Sound and image problems plague all five releases.  The two Technicolor classics, A STAR IS BORN and NOTHING SACRED suffer from color variations which go from a pinkish hue to something that looks like three-strip Technicolor.  At no time during these two films does one get any semblance to real Technicolor or anything close to it.  The best of the worst are LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is not saying much because the visuals are still substandard and so is the sound. It's just that compared to the other three aberrations, these two fare a little better.  But I would like to stress that the entire set is no better than a bad public domain copy of any of these films.  Kino has added no extras whatsoever, not even English subtitles.  It's a no frills package of unacceptable prints at premium prices.  This is an insult and a slap in the face to consumers and collectors.  There should be an agency that handles situations such as this, and Kino should be made liable, and be forced to reimburse EVERYONE who has fallen prey to their false claims and advertising and has purchased these five films, whether singly, or all together in a boxed set.  So be warned, if you spend any money on any of these 5 releases, you are just throwing your money away.  If you absolutely must have one or more of these films, I suggest borrowing them from your public library or renting them and making dubs.  It's exactly what Kino deserves for putting out crap like this.",1357516800,5,3085,4.666666666666667
992858,2,6305226571,"Unfortunately I have to agree with Dan. While an HD transfer might have been made, there has been no apparent attempt to restore the film. The quality of the colour is all right at times, but it's patchy and so poor in places that it looks as though it was shot with the 2-colour Technicolor process. The negative is clearly damaged in many places. What a shame.",1342483200,4,362,4.417910447761194
992859,1,6305226571,"The wikipedia page for ""Nothing Sacred"" states that the 2011 Kino DVD was ""made from 35mm nitrate Technicolor prints preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and authorized by the estate of David O. Selznick; prior to this most home video releases of both films had rather poor quality color. The Museum of Modern Art has restored both films to their technicolor splendor.""

On the wiki page is a screen capture of Margaret Hamilton in a scene from the film.  The color is indeed rich, luscious, with a full range of colors that reminds one of the great Technicolor films of that period.

Well, clearly Kino didn't use the version restored by MOMA.  All one has to do is to freeze-frame the same scene from this 2011 DVD, and compare it to the photo on the wiki page.  The Kino version doesn't even begin to compare.  There are virtually no bright, pure, intense colors...everything is faded beyond belief.  In fact, in many scenes, the faces look almost as if they're in black and white.  Even the print quality is poor, very scratched in places, especially at the beginning.

Sure, the information on the wiki page could be construed as misleading, or poorly written, but again, if there's a far, far better restored version of this movie out there, why does Kino continue to release such a poor quality one?",1341964800,3,1333,4.735930735930736
992860,4,6305226571,"This Blu-ray copy is not all that great and this film could use the careful guiding hands of preservationists, but as an early example of three strip technicolor it's o.k. I didn't buy this DVD to complain about early technicolor or the quality of the film. I just wanted a complete and unedited copy of this film which defined the era of screwball comedy and demonstrates better than any book could the talent and allure of Carole Lombard that is generally lost to modern audiences unless they are hooked up to cable legend TCM  24/7.
In this gem Lombard plays hapless Hazel Flagg who becomes involved in a deception that involves a cooked up story about her imminent death from a fatal malady. This movie is riddled with snappy performances and easy and even more rapid dialogue as Hazel tries to dig herself out of the predicament she's in and also find true love with none other than super handsome Frederic March.
Lombard's comedy often turns physical with hilarious results. As Hazel, she seemingly is always just one step away from disaster or discover. Despite the less than stellar technical quality of this print, this film is the perfect example of why Lombard is irreplaceable and the best copy of this film currently available.",1340755200,,1240,4.794392523364486

""Nothing Sacred,"" the definitive screwball comedy starring Carole Lombard and Frederic March (both at the height of their beauty and appeal, though not done near justice by those ugly statuettes of them during the opening credits) certainly fills that bill. Whether this new Blu-ray edition is worth its price is a little less easily declared.

Those who were hoping that the picture quality of this new release would be up there with other Technicolor films of its period which had the good fortune not to have fallen into public domain (""Robin Hood,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Elizabeth and Essex,"" the fashion show sequence in ""The Women,"" and of course ""Gone With the Wind"") may be a little disappointed. It still looks like a colorized black and white movie. The flesh tones are still pale pink and tan, and the dress on one woman in the nightclub scene is a suspiciously bright yellow. There's also some dirt on the film. Some budget-minded purchasers may hesitate to pay such a price for frankly not proportionately improved quality over low-priced previous editions or what they can record for themselves off Turner Classic Movies.

Still, ""Nothing Sacred"" is a must-have in anyone's film collection, and if this is the absolute best the Selznick estate can offer us, we should be thankful for small favors. If you can afford it, go for it.",1329523200,,1411,4.875

Margolis sums up capably, is simply top-notch screwball comedy-- one of the most sophisticated of the era (director Bill Wellman, known primarily for his taut action pictures, here holds his own and then some with the likes of Hawks, McCarey, Sturges and Cukor in a difficult genre).  And there is no question that this Kino release offers the finest print available to date.  After comparing it side by side with the best version I'd been able to acquire previously (Marengo Films' double feature paired with Wellman's brilliant 'A Star Is Born'), however, it doesn't shine quite as much as I had hoped.  Yes, Kino's image is sharper, the colors a bit more vivid and the audio track clearer, but it still has not been carefully restored and is plagued by many of the same defects that appear on the transfers of inferior public-domain copies.

To this very day, Hollywood casting directors still search for the ""Carole Lombard"" factor when seeking the qualities of a consummate female comic actress. Lombard's heartfelt and adept performance in Nothing Sacred remains a classic.
Back in December 2003, a spectacularly restored print of Nothing Sacred struck from the original three strip camera negatives was shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The clarity was pristine and the technicolor just popped off of the screen.

992924,5,6305226571,"Finally, after years of crappy 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation Public Domain prints (on both VHS and DVD), Kino has finally gotten their hands on the George Eastman House Nitrate 35mm Technicolor print of this amazingly funny screwball comedy from 1937.

Originally produced by Selznick International and distributed through United Artists, this satirical, sharp and snotty comedy is about the newspaper business in New York.  And how, in a series of accidents, the newspaper promotes a dying girl on their pages who isn't really dying!

This film, along with ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""Twentieth Century"" is the best comedy Carole Lombard ever made.  Fredric March also shines as the reporter.  The supporting cast includes two of the best character actors of the 1930's, Walter Connolly and Charles Winninger.  They're both hysterical.  Look for Margaret Hamilton, Hattie McDaniel, and Frank Fay featured in a small parts too.

Ben Hecht was responsible for the screenplay, and the lush, Gershwin-esque music was composed by Oscar Levant.  There's even a hot swing number by the Raymond Scott Quintette.

For my money, this was one of the 5 funniest films of the 1930's and it's great to finally get a superior quality print of it on DVD.

This DVD (or Blu Ray) is an absolute must-have.",1324425600,25,1280,5.018957345971564
992925,4,6305226571,"Nothing Sacred, one of the best screwball comedies ever, looks much better in this Marengo Films restoration than the version on Alpha films. This restoration has better contrast, finer detail and a smoother, more correct  color. And, of course, you have the added benefit of the original A Star Is Born.

Do not be misled by the jacket that indicates Nothing Sacred is in B&W, it is not. Both are early Technicolor films.  There is some image loss, but that is to be expected in films that are 70 years old. Neither film was given the Wizard of Oz treatment.

At this price, its a good buy.",1260748800,4,591,4.4953271028037385
7885537,5,6305226571,"Cute movie, of course it is predictable but likely wasn't back when. There are two versions on Amazon and this one to me is the better one with a clearer picture. The sound seems equal on both editions but my ear isn't that refined and I'd be interested to know what my girls think who have amazing ears but I don't know the terminology for what they can do. But I think this is a cute movie even if you don't like old movies but some of the entertainent is rather, well, funny, almost. I'm thinking it was likely rather sophisticated back when.",1515888000,,545,4.300970873786408

7885539,4,6305226571,"This may not be Carole Lombard's best movie, but it is my personal favorite with its wicked satire of superficial American society; especially amusing are the ""friendly"" small town and ""professional' wrestling send-ups. Unfortunately I must dock this Kino Blu-Ray release a star because it makes a  mockery of the kind of ""quality"" we should expect from this format. The image throughout looks washed-out and lacking in clarity. And as with the Kino DVD, it retains all of the imperfections of the original source, a nitrate Technicolor print which is supposedly the best print available. This needed a complete restoration which Kino obviously did not have the resources to perform. Personally, the Kino DVD release, which is still available from Walmart and Best Buy, and at least looks better than the other versions currently being sold, is recommended as the first option.",1500681600,,877,5.176056338028169
