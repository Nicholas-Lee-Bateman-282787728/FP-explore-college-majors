7905482,4,B000009HNS,"This is another excellent comedy from the king of dead-pan Michael Hui. This time he plays Inspector Chocolate (so called because of his love of Smarties). Alongside him is his trusty sidekick Egg-Tart (Ricky Hui). After  bumbling yet another case, Choclate's superior gives him the task of taking  his model/policewoman daughter under his wing. Now in charge of missing  persons, the threesome are on the hunt of the kidnapped son of a famous tv  chef. The great quality of this film is that the storyline is well-drawn  and not just an excuse for the comedy. Indeed the encounter with the  kidnapper at the end is actually quite touching. Scenes to look out for  include Michael Hui's disguise as a small, elderly woman; a truly  laugh-out-loud moment. Excellent entertainment.",945820800,,779,5.03125
