As someone out of shape and trying to overcome chronic pain, it seemed low impact and doable, so I joined in! I then found and bought this. It's very pleasant and I love the music. I always skip the scarf dance because it's too hard on my hands / wrists/ shoulders - too repetitive. There is a section at the end for 'free dance' and each dancer comes forward and is celebrated with the others. It's a 'feel good' type of video, you almost feel silly in your living room, like you are hanging out with all these awesome women and someone may walk in and catch you smiling ;) I really wish it was available on DVD!",1387929600,,691,4.242424242424242
7840098,4,6303182178,"I picked my copy up at the local Goodwill store. It's old and the exercisers wear outdated leotards. However the workout would be a good change of pace for many. The warm-up moves alone really worked the kinks out of my neck, shoulders and spine. A lot things in the tape reminded me of things I do in yoga class but with a fluid not bouncy movement built in. Some of the aerobic portion was too high impact for me so I had to modify. Overall this tape is mentally relaxing and gets you in touch with your body.",1193875200,,511,4.171717171717172
