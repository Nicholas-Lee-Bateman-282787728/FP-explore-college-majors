8429062,1,B004GYKNIA,"People, by now you should know that anyone with a bootleg video tape collection could throw one of these together. Kiss owns the rights to their logo. So, if you do not see the original KISS logo with the lightning bolt SS, it's NOT AN OFFICIAL KISS RELEASE! Buyer beware!",1327708800,2,272,4.46

8429066,1,B004GYKNIA,......are nice. These DVD is not. It hurt me and assaulted me in a bad place. Then it yelled at me and smacked my dog on the nose. Naughty DVD made me cry. Stay away from this DVD. It features 4 old men in tights who have weaves and issues. They frighten the mightiest of men. Run for the hills and hide. Poo poo on this DVD.,1191628800,,325,3.8656716417910446
