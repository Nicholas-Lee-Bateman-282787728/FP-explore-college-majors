8001605,4,B0000E1W28,Fun video following the Raiders fans through a season.,1428537600,,54,5.111111111111111
8001606,3,B0000E1W28,"I was hoping this would be ""Professionally shot"" and show the Black Hole crowd during games IN THE STADIUM.  If you remember before the AFC Championship against the Ravens, NBC did a piece on the Black Hole with Marilyn Manson's ""Beautiful People"" opening it up. I was hoping for something like that.  This dvd is mostly just interviews with tailgaters outside of the stadium.  It's more like a cheap bootleg, no offense.",1340150400,,421,4.819444444444445
8001607,5,B0000E1W28,"A great examination of the most loyal sports fans in the country. Destroys the myth that Raider fans are uneducated criminals. Raider Nation is filled with people from all backgrounds, gender, job description and favorite methods of applying body and face paint!  As the recent televised contest between Raider and 49er tailgaters showed, Raider Nation has no equal in cooking and tailgating! A must for members of the Raider Nation.",1288310400,3,433,5.185714285714286
8001608,5,B0000E1W28,"""Raider Nation"" is an excellent look at one of the most feared groups of fans in sports history.  The movie looks behind the scenes at tail-gaiting parties, Metallica concerts (held out-side the stadium), as well as a look at some of the most die-hard Oakland fans.  ""Nation"" is a must-see, if you know that you bleed silver and black!",1193011200,2,335,4.661016949152542
