4464058,3,B004SNI08O,Not bad but not great by any stretch. Orginal idea could have been really good if they had spent a little more on special effects. At several points they just got off on some strange tangent and then somehow come back to the original story line. Maybe they ran out of material and needed to fill time. On prime so I can't hate on it to much would not pay to rent it but if you have prime give it a shot.,1469750400,,403,3.926829268292683

4464061,3,B004SNI08O,"Special effects were great, but the arrogance of the female lead was detrimental to the story. Too many people killed, but came back to life. It was an original idea only because they used the invisible man's solution to time travel. She's a genius I heard once too often. They tried to pack too many ideas at the end to make the movie longer. It was interesting, but not good or great. Therefore I gave it a 3.",1468195200,,411,4.282051282051282

4464063,4,B004SNI08O,"Creative idea, plot a little too jumpy, audio is awful (music louder than actors). Fun to watch. Very low budget, almost 1950's. Enjoyable on Amazon Prime $0.00 free. Maybe $1 or 2 otherwise.",1464998400,,191,4.818181818181818

4464066,2,B004SNI08O,"Judge Patrick Bromley, DVD Verdict-- So, first the positive: Triple Hit (originally titles Schrodinger's Girl, which is considerably less commercial; the filmmakers have acknowledged as much) represents an honest attempt at doing some hard science fiction, and that's a rarity in movies today. Though there are obvious limitations to the budget (it's an independent British production, and the special effects often resemble Doctor Who at some of its worst moments), there is an attempt at scale and scope that has to be commended. Yes, many of the visual effects were obviously created on someone's laptop, but as long as you're able to suspend your disbelief (and you'll need to for a film about three parallel universes), you'll be able to appreciate the world(s) that writer/director Huw Bowen has tried to create.

Those are just about the only things about Tripe Hit that work very well, though, because the rest of the movie is kind of a mess. Star Abigail Tarttelin's performance is chief among the problems: it's bland and amateurish and largely unconvincing, compounded further by the fact that she's asked to play three characters when she's unable to pull off even one. The structure of the film is frustrating as well, as it bounces around from universe to universe (often courtesy of familiar ""wipe"" edits, because of Star Wars) even from the start. I couldn't help but think the film would be more powerful if it waited to reveal its ""multiverse,"" allowing us to discover what is happening alongside Rebecca. Instead, we get thrown right in to three different, concurrent plots, none of which seem very interested in providing characters or stories. Their only goal is that they be distinct from one another, so we get the bright white utopia, the cloudy, rubble-strew dystopia and the world that closely represents our own. When the universes begin to overlap and Rebecca encounters the other versions of herself, the movie picks up a little steam; unfortunately, it's around then that it also loses interest in some of its sci-fi ideas.

The movie arrives on DVD courtesy of Cinema Epoch. It's presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, and looks only ok at best. Because it's low budget and appears to have been shot on video, I'm willing to cut the softness and drab look of the movie a good deal of slack. The disc audio is more problematic, with a hollow, tinny-sounding stereo track with dialogue that's hard to hear and music levels that are way too loud. I found myself constantly having to adjust the volume throughout the movie, and it was a frustrating experience. The only extras included on the disc are the film's trailer and a still gallery of images from the movie, set to some music that does not fit the tone of what is being shown.

4464067,5,B004SNI08O,"It is indeed an independent film, a Sci-Fi nonetheless and just because of that, it makes it a rarity in itself. Having said that, I believe it's an understood that it should get credit for having the guts to be that. The story is different and original and, even though it tried to simplify quantum physics for us mere unscientific mortals (aka audience), there's still a storyline that can be followed if the scientific part fails the audience. Some of the performances could have been better, but overall it was a movie I enjoyed. I'm glad it made it all the way from England to the U.S. and didn't just stay underground roaming some selected festivals. That reminds me, I found out it won best Sci-Fi at the Phoenix Film Festival in Arizona. Check it out!",1311465600,5,759,4.588235294117647

4464070,4,B004SNI08O,"Ok, my rating is probably skewed as I'm a Paul R. Hardy fan boy.  The acting is not amazing at all.  The title of this movie really doesn't make sense as to what the movie is really about.  Originally it was called Schrodingers girl.  Any way.  If you are a fan of Hardy's universe in his books this will fit nicely into your brain.  I didn't know it was written by him at first, but had a suspicion when the agency of parallel universes showed up.  Once I was able to get past the acting of the main heroine I was able to submerge my self into this world and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's low budget but still pretty cool.  Could he have chosen another of his amazing stories to film? I don't know, making a movie is expensive, especially the stories he could tell.  I love almost anything parallel universe inspired I felt this delivered.  It wasn't amazing, but it was fun.  I look forward to more from his universe.",1475712000,,918,4.304093567251462

4464072,2,B004SNI08O,"Original idea with a rather poorly developed plot.  In addition, the sound system is so bad that it is difficult at times to understand the dialogue when there's a very loud music playing in the background.  It's a pity because the Parallel Universe them along with the 3 universes simultaneously working on the same project had the potential for a great movie...Finally, the producers selected rather bad actors for the main characters of the plot.  In view of the above, I do not recommend this film to anyone with the probable exception of those (like myself) who are fascinated with Parallel Universes. .",1474156800,2,608,4.883495145631068

4464074,1,B004SNI08O,"I love a good sci-fi tale, but this wasn't it.  It's possible I would have enjoyed it a little more if I could have heard what was transpiring, but setting volume to maximum tolerable background level I still couldn't hear or understand most of the dialogue well enough to know what was going on.

Acting was rather poor - from what I could hear.  Camera work was pathetic. Obviously sound quality sucked water from the Thames.  And the director should be limited to a job of picking up trash because he's evidently very good at that.  And Abigail should stick to working in a pub.",1471651200,,581,4.495238095238095

4464076,2,B004SNI08O,"If you really enjoy science fiction, you'll want to see this even with my rating of 2 stars.  The ideas behind it have been done before, although movies generally don't combine several major themes as this one does.  If you aren't a really big SF fan, don't even waste your time with this.
The pros - it's hard sci-fi, it can hold your attention for at least part of the runtime
The cons - bad acting (universally, and especially from the main character), bad special effects (as bad as early Dr. Who), bad directing, bad cinematography, an unoriginal set of plots, and a sometimes confused story line",1470700800,,601,4.607476635514018

8440003,5,B004SNI08O,"'Triple Hit' is an intriguing sci-fi tale about three female scientists (all played by the same actress Abigail Tarttelin) in three alternate universes and the incidents they encounter as they travel from one to another. Yes, it's hampered by a low budget but don't let that stop you from checking this out",1523923200,,306,4.903846153846154
8440004,3,B004SNI08O,"Parallel worlds lurk behind a lot of time travel - since one way of getting around the paradox of that, if you changed the past, how would the earlier you in the future know that the past needed to be changed if it no longer existed, but if the new reality were a parallel reality, in which the event that needed changing now never happened, there would be no problem, since the time traveler came from the old reality - but it's not often been explored in the movies, though it was a mainstay of Fringe on television and is the theme of just-beginning Counterpart.

All of which is to say I was eager to see Triple Hit, because it's a movie in which parallel universes are almost the whole story.  The ""almost,"" though, is its main problem, since it also brings in space travel and time travel, and is a bit of a free-for-all hodge-podge of science fiction tropes.

But it has its moments.  Triple Hit (originally Schrdinger's Girl - you ever notice how the original titles are usually much better than what they've been changed to?) tells the story of Rebecca/Anastasia/Sarah, Dave/David/Dmitri, Matt/Matthew/Mateus, etc in three parallel realities (worlds) in which Rebecca/Anastasia/Sarah is/are trying to break on through to at least one of the other realities.  All of the realities are some version of our United Kingdom.  One of them is pretty much like ours, another seems like a high-tech white-coated European Union, and the third, the most fun, is a ""People's Republic,"" replete with a statue of Stalin and obeisance to the Soviet Union(!).

Of course something goes wrong with the attempt and frenetic craziness and mayhem ensue, done up almost in a slapstick 1950s bug-eyed-monster B-movie kind of style.  So ... it's hard to take Triple Hit seriously, but it is fun, especially in the wee hours of the morning.  See it if parallel worlds are your many cups of tea.",1514246400,,1879,4.756923076923077
