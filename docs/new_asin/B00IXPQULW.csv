6303959,3,B00IXPQULW,"this set has some of my favorite episodes from my youth.  My 5yr old son recently discovered the original Transformers so we bought the disks for it.  The show is great and we love bonding over it.  The only issue I have is that the box was ruined when I opened the padded envelope.  There apepared to be a thumb-sized hole in the upper portion of the case, but the disks seems to be in good condition -2 for flimsy packaging/ruined box",1424908800,,436,4.280487804878049

6303989,4,B00IXPQULW,"This review is for the 2014 edition, 30th Anniversary disc set.  It is the same program content as the 2009 edition, but the discs are all in one box instead of two mini-clamshells inside a cardboard sleeve, and there is no booklet with episode descriptions.  This was a little disappointing to discover upon its arrival, since I didn't realize there would be this substantial difference, which is why it gets a 4 instead of 5 as I'd give the 25th Anniversary edition, because this one isn't as 'deluxe'.",1453420800,,504,4.715909090909091
