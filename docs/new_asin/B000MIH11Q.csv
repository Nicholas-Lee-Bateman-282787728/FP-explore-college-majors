The lead kid has an odd sort of racial ambiguity, looking sort of like C. Thomas Howell in ""Soul Man,"" but with more of a Native American cast about him. (I'm a father of kids of color, so I can say that, right? Well, maybe not. I guess I should ask my wife...) This kid's in some kind of at-risk youth camp or home, where the counselors are on the verge of sending him off to juvy hall for being incorrigible. It's kind of hard to figure out what exactly his problem is - if he were explicitly being picked on because of his ethnicity (whatever it is), that's not made clear by the film. As it stands, he just comes off as kind of a d**k.

The kid's personal counselor is really kind of stupid, as the kid ends up seemingly drowning during some sort of Outward Bound-type of wilderness outing. But he's actually lost in the wilderness, where he meets/is saved by a backwoods...um, mountain man? Hobo? Sasquatch? The guy is none of those, but he has elements of all three. He teaches the kid life lessons. Kid goes back to civilization. The end.

It's definitely not very good, but it's interesting if you're into obscure '80s video productions (like I am, obviously). For specialists and the obsessed only. Or if, maybe, you were in it.",1511136000,,1304,4.447698744769874
