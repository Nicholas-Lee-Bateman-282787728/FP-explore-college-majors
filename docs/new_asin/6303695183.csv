703662,1,6303695183,"THE VIDEO WAS BORING.  GO WITH SOMETHING MORE MOTIVATING.  SUCH AS, THE ORIGINAL STEP REEBOK,WHICH, FOR SOME REASON, CANNOT BE ORDERED FROM AMAZON.  I WISH IT COULD BE BECAUSE MINE IS OLD AND WORN OUT. WHAT A DRAG.  NOW YOU  SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT IT IS.  BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DANCE  STEP.",936144000,4,305,4.4363636363636365
703839,5,6303695183,"I hate complex choreography, I don't have the patience to learn it, but I found this to be very very do able.  I enjoy Petra and Casey and Dwayne, too.  Once you get to know the routine, it is easy to add propulsion throughout to pick up the intensity if you want to.  This tape has been a staple for me for years.",1133222400,2,314,3.9523809523809526
703840,5,6303695183,"I love this video because - as others have mentioned - it is an awesome workout when you just don't have the time to dig out your 50 minute tapes.  Don't let the duration of the video worry you, though, because I promise you that when you are finished your heart will be pumping and muscles burning.  I admit, the first time I watched it I was a bit discouraged, thinking, ""I will never be able to master this.""  But, Petra leads you through this workout beautifully, and if you take the time you can easily have it mastered.",1129593600,,525,4.282828282828283
703841,4,6303695183,"** I believe this is the perfect blend of dance and step-aerobics.

** It is short, about 4-min. warm-up, 20-min. workout, 4-min. cool-down.

** For an intermediate exerciser and stepper, it keeps my heart rate up, not pounding hard but up, and muscles challenged.

** The instructor, Petra is upbeat, motivating without being too much of a cheerleader. She pretty much smiles and gives directions. She does cue well e.g. ""Okay, now we're going to go over the board and then walk around it to the right.""

** What's really unique about this video is the background. It begins with Petra saying "" I believe that it is true that we are going back to the mind and body."" In the back of her and the two other people is a board that flashes pictures of the ocean, forest, Da-Vinci-like pics of the body, oriental letters, and words & phrases like ""Visualize"", ""Release the ego"", and ""Step out of your own way."" It may seem minor, but for me the background keeps it interesting. I can appreciate art and read literature and exercise too.",1107820800,4,1031,4.586956521739131
703842,4,6303695183,"Man, oh, man...I wish the sound was better in this video because the music is nice and funky and I'd love to turn it up! But, alas, after purchasing one video, and getting one as a gift, the simple fact is that the sound quality just isn't the best. (and its not just my tape or my stereo) HOWEVER - don't let that get in the way of a fun workout! The choreography in this one is what makes it a kick to do. I'm used to Kathy Smiths ""military"" style aerobics, where every move is predictable yet effective. But Petra delivers a workout with some ""attitude"" and some funky dance moves thrown in to make it interesting. She teaches you three segments and at the end incorporates them into one single routine. Watch the other steppers for ideas on how to make the choreography more individualized. Or as Petra says, ""Make this as funky or as elegant as you like""... This is a short but powerful workout, with a very quick warm-up and almost non-existant cool-down. But that makes it perfect on the days you're pressed for time and still want to sweat and feel good. If it weren't for the sound quality, I would've rated this with 5 stars...",1020124800,4,1137,4.393364928909953
703843,4,6303695183,"Only a few moves in this video really qualify as dance steps, and they're over before you know it. Nevertheless, this is a fun video, the steps are pretty easy to learn, and they're repeated enough that you can learn them after one or two tries. The music is upbeat, there's an artsy video backdrop, and the people stepping with Petra seem very enthusiastic. It's a bit short, but great for days when you don't feel like a long, strenuous workout. Sometimes the instructor is a bit condescending, and I hate it when she says, during the leg stretches, ""we call this the hamstring muscle"". Well, duh!",1015113600,3,599,4.607476635514018
703844,5,6303695183,"If you have to squeeze in a workout during other activities at home, this is a great tape.  Like another mom who wrote a review, I can be sure to finish this tape *BEFORE* the baby wakes up, so it's much more satisfying.  Plus, since I homeschool my other kids, I don't have a lot of free time during the day.  The tape is also great on those *many* days when one of the three kids is sick, and I can't go to the gym.  Just wish there were more like it.  Dancey enough to be interesting, not so dancey that I couldn't learn it after a few tries.",1006732800,2,545,3.963302752293578
703845,4,6303695183,"This video would be rated five stars had the workout been longer than 25 minutes. Petra is easily one of the best instructors out there. She is an excellent choreographer, gives clear instructions, and motivates well. Great video. You will simply want to add some more excercises afterwards. The modern industrial generic music is refreshing in a way but I prefer more upbeat music. I guess the producers were thinking that the repetitive generic beat would be lasting and not get ""dated"".",1005091200,,489,4.975609756097561
703846,3,6303695183,"I love Petra Kolber.  She is an excellent instructor and she gives really easy directions. HOWEVER I found this tape a bit repetitive after a few workouts and I really didn't like the music (hence the three stars).  The tape does give a good workout.  Petra seems to assume that the person soing the tape knows step lingo but after a few viewings you'll know what ""V"" step  and ""over the top"" mean.
This tape is a good value and worth the buy but I would recommend getting it along with another tape for variety.",999648000,,512,4.3578947368421055
703847,4,6303695183,"This video is really fast and really fun.  Although it gets my pulse going, I have to admit it isn't a very strong workout. It is very short and there are no sit-ups or push-ups at the end (I usually add them myself).  The steps don't repeat as much as other videos which means you don't feel  your muscles burn.  The workout is more complex than the original Reebok  step workout, but I picked it up after 4 or 5 times and it's much more  interesting.  I do this tape a lot and use it to motivate me on days I am  looking for an excuse not to exercise; no time, it only takes 25 minutes,  not enough energy, it's a really easy work-out.  I like Petra's personality  and the two people who work out behind her are nice to watch.  The music is  MUCH better than the original Reebok step video.  I wouldn't recommend this  tape as a first step tape, because the steps are more complicated and it  doesn't show what an intense low-impact workout step can be, but I do think  it's a great addition to the original Reebok step aerobic tape.",964569600,17,1035,4.225641025641026
703848,5,6303695183,"I loved this video a lot! Petra Kolber is my favorite aerobics instructor because she embellishes basic aerobics moves with jazzy and funky flavor. Her choreography makes me look forward to working out every single second  of the video. Her moves are very inspiring and for me, she's the best! Keep  up the excellent work Petra!",950140800,4,328,4.839285714285714
7852812,5,6303695183,Love this video. One of my favorites,1485993600,,36,4.285714285714286
7852813,5,6303695183,Great workout video. It really gets you sweating and your heart pumping. Fast and fun!,1419724800,,86,4.8
7852814,5,6303695183,I love this set video. It is quick and can really get me started for the day! I have been using it for years!,1398988800,,109,3.5833333333333335
7852815,1,6303695183,"This VHS only worked for a few months.  I thought that my VCR was the problem so I cleaned it several times but the VHS still did not work.

I put another VHS into my VCR and it worked perfectly.",1362009600,,195,3.85
7852816,5,6303695183,I love step work outs and this one is a favorite.  Love Petra.  The workout is short but sweet.  Hate that its only available on VHS.,1361577600,,133,4.038461538461538
7852817,4,6303695183,"This is such a fun workout.  I recently bought a new tape to replace a worn out one.  My only regret is that it does not have a DVD version (I'd give it 5 stars if it did).  I'm a roller-coaster of fitness.  When I'm out of shape this is just the ticket to get going again and stay motivated.  When I am in really good shape this is my go to for fun when I need an easier day or I don't feel like working out.  Instructor is great & encourages you to ""make it your own"".  The workout is about 1/2 hour long.  Go ahead - ENJOY working out.",1352937600,,538,3.7837837837837838
7852818,5,6303695183,"If it came in DVD, I'd buy it again.  This is a great dancer's workout...a good distraction to actually working out as one remembers the routine.  It may not produce the burn some love, but it certainly burns calories.",1295481600,,218,4.564102564102564
7852819,5,6303695183,"I had this video 10 years ago, and bought it again recently (after living abroad for a number of years. I think it's an excellent short workout and has a nice aesthetic. Petra Kolber is really good, as well. Anyway - this is on VHS, I bought a used copy. I'm sure there are tons of new DVDs to compete, but I did really like this one in 1999!",1232150400,,342,3.971014492753623
7852820,5,6303695183,"I enjoy anything that Petra does, but I really love this workout. It keeps you thinking and the armwork in particular is so different and interesting. You really feel like you are dancing and your step is a prop.

The three dancers look like they are having fun and are feeling good about their performances. All three have different dancing styles and, after you learn the basic routine, you will want to watch everyone and get inspired by his/her variations.

I also like the New Age style music and the constantly-changing background screen which projects behind the dancers. I did not find it distracting while I was learning the routine. After I became more practiced, I could take the time to look at the screen.

Even though there is a learning curve here, you will still get aerobic benefit while you are learning, because the moves are first presented in a basic version, on which the more complex moves are added.

It would be awesome if this were re-issued in DVD form, but take advantage of the great VHS prices and give this a try. It is definitely not ""more of the same"" old step class.",1158105600,3,1100,4.596938775510204
7852821,5,6303695183,"Pressed for time?  This is the work out for you.  Petra's choreography is fun -- and the right level of difficulty -- and gives you a great cardio work out.  The best option if you only have 30 minutes, and want to squeeze in a work out.  PLUS: if you're looking to boost your cardio fitness level, you can rotate this workout between your longer ones, and increase the step height.  This will give your body time to adjust gradually and safely to the challenge of a higher step.  Don't hesitate!",1152662400,3,496,4.395604395604396
