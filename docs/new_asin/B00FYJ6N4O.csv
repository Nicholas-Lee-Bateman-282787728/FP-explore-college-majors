8619441,5,B00FYJ6N4O,"It's strange that Amazon is taking Pre-Orders for this Two-Pack DVD, which is to be released on May 6, 2014, at a price of $20.68.

It's strange because... I picked up the Two-Pack BLU-RAY (Yes, I said Blu-Ray) of this combo (""Life of Pi"" and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") at Best Buy TODAY (March 27) for $12.99! (FYI: the SKU # for this item at Best Buy is 2936013, but it's not on their website).

Actually, even better, it's the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy COMBO-PACK of both movies. That's right, the ""Life of Pi"" has the Blu-Ray, the DVD, and the Digital-Copy versions of the film, and the ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" has the Blu-Ray, the DVD, and the Digital-Copy of the film. All for $12.99!

So, I got it more than a month earlier, on BLU-RAY (with DVD and Digital-Copy included), for $7.69 LESS than what Amazon is pre-selling it for on just DVD! What's going on, Amazon?

Just a heads up, y'all.",1395878400,4,906,4.5060975609756095
8619442,5,B00FYJ6N4O,Both are exceptional movies and the combined price was incredible @ $11. Well worth shopping the daily specials at Amazon.,1390003200,,122,5.15
8619443,3,B00FYJ6N4O,"I could obviously do a five star, but honestly, I ordered a two pack of movies my wife and I really like, and that's what I got.  It met my expectations, I would buy from the seller again and I'm very happy with the purchase.",1390003200,,225,4.0
8619444,5,B00FYJ6N4O,Both movies are great thought provoking movies.  The cinematography is beautiful and well done. I am glad to have them.,1390003200,,119,4.95
8619445,5,B00FYJ6N4O,Great movie in all aspects of movie filming.  Great job in telling a story that elecits emotions.  Do not hesitate to buy this dvd,1389744000,,130,4.375
8619446,3,B00FYJ6N4O,"We haven't watched Life of Pi yet but the Beasts of the Southern Wild was a little weird.  The little girl who acts in the movie is AMAZING!!  I will watch it again without other people as I think I will catch more of the story.  If you get it, it might be helpful to watch the extras first and learn about the story.  We didn't do that but after the movie we watched the extras and now I would like to watch the movie again.",1388534400,,425,3.9069767441860463
