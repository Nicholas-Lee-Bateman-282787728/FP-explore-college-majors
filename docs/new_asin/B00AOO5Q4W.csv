5463383,3,B00AOO5Q4W,"The story runs with 2-4 subplots. Four ""chicks"" run a desert gas station/saloon/ meth lab/ car wash/strip joint etc. They are visited by a band and  escapee with his girl friend. There is also a subplot about two dirty cops. The film was short episodes that basically lacked plot and direction.

The film opens by informing the viewing audience that this is a low budget ""B"" movie because apparently the target audience couldn't figure that out for themselves. The dialogue needed polish. If you are going to name one chick ""Mike the Mechanic"" you need other rock band names. The end credits include a song track listing except the popular cover songs that appeared in the film and I question if they have the rights to them.

The film was low quality all around. 3 stars for the nudity.

F-bombs, sex, nudity (Sara Plotkin -thank you, Elske McCain, Rose Gorlano, GJ Tiari, Toni Couillard, Emma Rhodes +others)",1407283200,3,910,4.777070063694268
5463384,3,B00AOO5Q4W,"I really enjoyed it. Honest! (see all the other reviews for the reasons. This is a pretty straight forward, unpretentious film that delivers what it promises.) So why not more stars? Well, I often had no idea what was going on (not that I really cared) and the acting and filming was not that great so I just can't give it more than three stars --but did I mention that it was a lot of fun? I do plan to watch it again some day. It's most certainly more entertaining than some biker flicks and some Hollywood big budget films that I've seen.",1405814400,,541,4.262135922330097
5463385,4,B00AOO5Q4W,"kbcStars : Brenna Roth, Sara French,Trent Haaga, Elske McCain and Ted V Mikels.

In a Regan Redding flick.

So,Its like a Whose who of Shot -On Video  and very much delivers in gore,bikes and mean girls.

If,You could imagine most manly biker movies and what they got away with in the 1950s,1960s and even in  1980sIts alot of catching up by the female hog riders.

The biker girls as a whole aren't likable, Excepting of course there looks and figures are most impressive by all.

The victims, Using that term loosely, Are so deserving of the tortures inflicted by the Biker Chicks.

Great title,great cover art with the real actresses posing for it and as mentioned the film succeeds on its promises and more.killerchicks4",1401753600,,724,4.782258064516129

5463391,5,B00AOO5Q4W,"Maybe I'm just a little crazy but I thought the cops we're pretty funny. As far as the sex scenes go I've watched several scenes over and over and over when I am alone if you know what I mean.  The story is a little scattered at times but I think it adds to the feel of the movie and poetically enhances the reality of such a lifestyle.
There could have been more ""gore"" but as far as cold heartedness goes this movie's characters are all VERY cold blooded and heartless.
If you want to get laid but your girl won't watch porn then this is a great movie.  It's also very good to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon.
My only complaint is that there are not enough motorcycles.",1264377600,7,674,4.176923076923077

5463393,3,B00AOO5Q4W,"Typical ""B"" rated biker gang flick, with the added plot enhancement of the biker gang being female. Adds a little spice to the old plot theme. Almost enough to give it a 4-star rating but not quite. The black and white film and poor film quality hold it to a 3-star. The added R+ addition of the girls did make it more enjoyable to watch though.",1456617600,,345,4.242424242424242

5463399,1,B00AOO5Q4W,"Unbelievably unwatchable. Acting, sound quality, plot, filming were all AWFUL. We watched about 15 minutes of it and then stopped. Do not waste your time. You won't even get a laugh out of it.",1454544000,,192,4.676470588235294
5463400,2,B00AOO5Q4W,"Many if not most 'B' movies usually possess some sort of technical skill in the making. The writing may be sloppy-to-awful, the dialogue cringe-inducing, the acting painful to witnessand sometimes these elements make for hilarious unintentional comedybut at least the crew making the film knew, to some degree, how to do their jobs. Combine a modicum of technical prowess with the exploitation stuff that this kind of movie promisesnudity, sex, violence, gore, etc.and you have a decent B-movie.

A few films are so poorly made that they are a chore to watch; they are not worth whatever fun stuff they may have been filled with. The resolution on this picture is awful. It looks like it was shot with a vintage 720x480 camcorder. There is so much noise in the low light scenes and so many soft-to-off-focus shots, I gave up on this movie about 15 minutes in when I saw the picture wasn't getting any better. I didn't mind so much that the script seemed to have been written by a sixth grader. What I couldn't get past is that six-year-old kids are shooting better footage on six-year-old iPhones.

Poor story, poor filmmaking, poor quality in general = unworthy of 100 minutes of my time, much less a spot on my video shelves.",1454371200,2,1227,4.728971962616822
