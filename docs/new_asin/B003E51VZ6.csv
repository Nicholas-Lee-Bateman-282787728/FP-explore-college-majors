4112990,4,B003E51VZ6,"Ian R. Crane presents the case that the purpose of flu vaccinations is to promote the spread of disease rather than prevent it. Crane goes further, tying this conspiracy to the push to ratify the EU constitution. Although Crane could easily be lumped together with ""conspiracy nuts"" his presentation contains well-reasoned connections between seemingly disconnected events. His juxtaposition of news items like the murder of two French student researching the origins of bird flu, Donald Rumsfeld's involvement in the 1976 flu panic and the marketing of Aspertane in the early 1990's will delight the conspiracy buff. Crane even wraps up with 11:11 and projections about 2012, the London Olympics and the pending imposition of oppressive world government! Deliciously subversive.",1275264000,4,779,5.554621848739496
4112991,4,B003E51VZ6,"This lecture by Ian R. Crane presents enough information about the camaraderie between the government and pharmaceutical companies to make your blood boil. The suggestion of profitability in panic is unsettling to say the least, yet this film presents enough material to make it believable. Everyone should watch this film and take the information into consideration the next time we hear about the threat of an epidemic like the more recent swine flu. Conspiracy or not, the information presented in ""The Truth Injection"" is definitely food for thought.",1274832000,2,554,5.306818181818182
4112992,4,B003E51VZ6,"I'm a big fan of Dr. Leonard Coldwell (check out [...]).  As a health freedom fighter he often preaches the dangers of our government and how they try to control us and make us ill.  The Swine Flu scare is just one of them.  I was eager to see The Truth Inject by Ian R. Crane since he delves into many of the same things.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.

Just what are the government and pharmaceutical companies doing?  They certainly aren't doing much for us, are they?  After all, they all work hand in hand and are hugely wealthy and powerful--at our expense.  Should this film be called nothing more than a conspiracy theory?  Some may, though I tend to believe that more of it is truth rather than fiction.",1271721600,2,718,4.378787878787879
4112993,4,B003E51VZ6,"This lecture by Ian R. Crane presents a wealth of information to contemplate.  If you think the relationship between money, government and the pharmaceutical industry is a little scary, this may find you screaming.  And if you're a conspiracy buff, you might not be surprised to learn that Donald Rumsfield was involved in promoting both the Swine Flu scare of 1976 and the more recent Bird Flu scare.  Did he have a political and financial interest in creating panic?  Maybe, but one thing is true: the Politics of Fear is alive and well, and the aim is power, money and control.  Whether there's an overall plan is a leap of faith, however.  Crane makes that leap, but I'm not so sure.",1271548800,2,687,4.636363636363637

8395273,1,B003E51VZ6,"Another ""documentary"" made by a vaccine alarmist kook, with a heavy dose of whacky conspiracy theories thrown in to make it ""interesting"".  It did help me get to sleep, though... about halfway through.  I firmly believe that vaccines do far more good than harm.  Spreading this kind of irresponsible and uninformed fear mongering around is rather like a social Darwinism experiment that may have the effect of culling some of the more gullible and paranoid members from the population.",1508457600,,485,5.113924050632911
8395274,1,B003E51VZ6,This is actually absurd propaganda. The good news is that the awful production values will keep most people from sitting through much of it. The bad news is that some people actually believe this has something to do with truth and science.,1507161600,,239,4.714285714285714

8395276,5,B003E51VZ6,Reality check on vaccines. I am thankful for the fact we are in the age of information for knowledge like this..great packaging came in timely fashion,1454025600,,150,4.8076923076923075
8395277,5,B003E51VZ6,More than ever I think it's important to keep up with what the various governments are hiding from us on a daily basis. Now I'm hearing about remote controlled mosquito drones. This of course fits right into the plans documented in this great video. Sleep with one eye open people.,1368835200,,281,4.64
8395278,4,B003E51VZ6,It's apparently easy for the naysayers to dismiss the facts contained here as merely theories but I think they need to open their eyes. With everything going on in the world today it's pretty obvious there is more to the big picture than what we are being spoon fed.,1367539200,,266,4.448979591836735
8395279,4,B003E51VZ6,I don't consider myself paranoid but this video has got me rethinking things. Sometimes some of the most obvious things are right in front of your eyes. The degree to which this is exposed is staggering.,1357084800,,203,4.666666666666667
8395280,4,B003E51VZ6,"Ian Crane does a great job of connecting the dots.  He brings up a lot of interesting connections that will make you paranoid (and rightly so)!  This isn't a DVD for those who ""don't want to know""...it certainly makes you question things.",1353283200,,238,4.642857142857143
8395281,4,B003E51VZ6,"The truth surely is stranger than fiction. Combing provocative theories and an unflinching narrative, ""The Truth Injection"" is a must-see film (conducted by Ian R. Crane). Its cries against pharmaceutical profiteering and the too-uncertain public will resonate with all; providing a detailed look to the past, present and possible future. It's a worthwhile watch.

The film's greatest asset may also be its greatest flaw, however. Its bleak examination will shock (perhaps too much so). The overall impression is shaded a little too close to hyperbole. Those seeking sterner fare will be surprised--and perhaps too ready to discredit this as just another biased documentary.

Despite this, however, ""The Truth Injection"" does still offer valid points. The questions it raises will remain long after the time is done--and, from there, the audience will choose what their answers shall be.",1277164800,2,887,5.467153284671533
