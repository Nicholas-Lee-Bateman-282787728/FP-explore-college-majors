8753397,1,B01CKLG7GM,Love the movie.  The format was a DVD-R but that's not currently stated in the product description.  The disc was also defective.,1483056000,,129,4.818181818181818
8753398,1,B01CKLG7GM,"One of the most awful monster movies I've ever seen. Correction - THE most awful movie I've ever seen. It makes ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" look good in comparison. I threw it away.",1475193600,,179,4.294117647058823
8753399,1,B01CKLG7GM,This movie truly sucked.,1473120000,,24,5.25
8753400,1,B01CKLG7GM,"I love a good B Movie; this isn't one of them
  I turned it off midway through.",1468540800,,79,3.588235294117647
8753401,5,B01CKLG7GM,I love old classic b-movie scifi films and this is just wonderful!,1461369600,,66,4.583333333333333
8753402,2,B01CKLG7GM,"This is a schlocky remake of the much better ""Invasion of the Saucer Men"". It tries to be funny in the way the original was using many of the same lines but delivered by actors who just don't get the joke. The creatures are true rubber suit horrors that arrive in a paper plate flying saucer. AND there is no drunk bull, or Frank Gorshin.
Should have rented this one because it was not worth the $5 price",1460764800,,404,4.1923076923076925
8753403,5,B01CKLG7GM,"Yes, they actually made this film and yes, it's brilliant!",1460592000,,58,4.9
