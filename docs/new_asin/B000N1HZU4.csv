8173871,3,B000N1HZU4,"A one-act, multi segment play for which I searched nearly twenty years. A review is rather pointless; as it has long been out of ""print"" and virtually unavailable. But, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only DVD  (or video cassette) on which the work of the remarkable legitimate stage actor, Marco Barracelli, can be seen.  Longtime admirers of Barracelli who thrilled to his work at Oregon Shakespeare Festival or San Francisco's ACT, will be excited to watch his portrayal of an aging Christopher Columbus in this flawed play.  The script was really disappointing; the plot was one long whine; but it was Marco; and that was enough for me.  Incidentally, the people who tracked this DVD down for Amazon and sent it on to me were an absolute delight to work with.  They get their kicks out of the pursuit of hard-to-find materials and are justified in being proud of their work.",1315958400,,885,4.683870967741935
