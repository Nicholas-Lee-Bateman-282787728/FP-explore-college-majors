1269108,5,B000038IFA,"This video shows how to teach your dog to: take a bow, play dead, roll over, ring a bell (for potty time), open and close doors, wave, back up, spin around, and get his or her leash.  The trainers use  ""clicker"" training and a clicker is included with your video.  The instructions are very clear and only positive reinforcement is used.  The trainers even give you tips for dogs that are having trouble learning  the tricks.  It is a really good video.  The trainers are upbeat and are  very experienced in dog training.  This is one of the few videos on dog  tricks that really makes it easy and fun to train your dog beyond basic  obedience.  I have already sent for the second video!",960249600,5,687,4.408

7917461,3,B000038IFA,"Horribly overpriced,(it has come down in price though), but it is what it is. A lesson with a master. I have always had a problem with the French Bow. I now have more success. I haven't even watched the whole thing, and my overall bass playing is better and less tiring.. Simple things like learning to use your weight while fingering, are abstract. This gives you practical knowledge. I would give this 5 stars but I am unhappy to pay so much for a DVD.",1420934400,2,454,4.352941176470588

7917467,5,B000038IFA,"This video makes dog training fun for both dog and owner. Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman thoroughly explain the clicker method of training in a very light and easy to follow video. They use formerly labeled ""untrainable"" breeds to demonstrate the unbelievable tricks on this delightful video. No dog is ""untrainable"" with these methods. As a dog trainer of 20 years, I recommend this  video to all dog handlers from competition obedience and conformation handlers to pet owners.",976492800,5,484,5.205128205128205
