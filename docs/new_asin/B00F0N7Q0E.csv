8611130,5,B00F0N7Q0E,I have never wrote a review but this is so great I have to. Worth every penny and I am picky about my 3-D choices. One of the best I own and I own alot.,1461974400,,152,3.3714285714285714
8611131,5,B00F0N7Q0E,This was very good. I learned as well as being entertained. The spider who throws a net and the Jeweled Cockroach Wasp were amazing.,1443225600,,132,4.541666666666667
8611132,5,B00F0N7Q0E,This is made for 3D.  The images are incredibly detailed and the movie is both interesting and informative.  It is worth getting this disc for the 3D quality alone.,1429833600,,164,4.620689655172414
8611133,5,B00F0N7Q0E,"David Attenborough and his team are the very best in the genre. This DVD is a marvel of science and showmanship!

8611134,4,B00F0N7Q0E,"This has great 3 d however it is comprised of several 5? 7? segments with the same lead in and a lengthy next program feature making in all a great deal of duplication I wish it had been edited into one seamless program as the fast forwarding after about 15 minutes of new program gets a little tedious.

 For Wonderful 3d get Attenborough Alive from Natl Hist Mus London. 3d is outstanding equal to Avatar level.",1408060800,,413,4.421052631578948
8611135,5,B00F0N7Q0E,"The best nature footage of bug I've ever seen.
Each episode blew my mind.
Every bit up to the David Attenborough standard.",1397520000,2,122,4.590909090909091
8611136,2,B00F0N7Q0E,"I purchased it to see all six episodes and the 50 min worth BEHIND THE SCENE film. i.e., about 3 hour worth content.
Unfortunately this doesn't include the 50 min worth behind the scene episode. Essentially what you get just about 120 mins content. The available content is AWESOME.  I am rating it low only because it was missing the episode that was claimed in the disc cover. Just reported the issue to Amazon; and returning this item.",1391212800,2,438,4.615384615384615
8611137,5,B00F0N7Q0E,"Not only is this a great nature documentary, but the 3D is astonishing. It really puts you on the level of the insects and allows you to see the kinds of details that would normally be impossible to see in stereo with two eyes.

Note: The Amazon listing calls this Region B, but the disc I received is region free.",1390089600,8,314,4.233333333333333
