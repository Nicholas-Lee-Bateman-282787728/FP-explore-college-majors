Apparently the original was filmed in Italian or Spanish -- either way, a language that averages more syllables per word than English, so that the dialogue comes out full of stuff like "" All right, that is the way in which the thing is to be done, you see, so let us continue to follow the original plan don't you agree?""  Anything to have sounds happening while the characters' mouths are moving, and never mind if what's being said sounds like the speaker is a visitor from some other galaxy that doesn't teach Modern Languages very well ...",1511654400,,708,4.5234375
7889873,3,630546345X,"These kinds of movies are really all down to your taste. Personally, I really enjoy cheesy spy spoof films from the 60s. So, my enjoyment of the movie was a lot higher than the average person's. What's interesting to me is that the movie appears to be cut. They've removed the saucier bits that I'm pretty sure exist in any Jess Franco movie. It makes for a fun experience in it's own way. You keep thinking you're missing out on something and it becomes a bit of a mystery to be solved.

All that aside, the movie is fun for what it is. 2 ladies who are maybe burglars, maybe do-gooders, maybe spies, etc. are hired to find a lady by an older man. It leads to dance routines, lots of lounging mostly naked, obligatory Franco jazz sequences, tacky home decor, and most importantly lots of travel to this locations shots payed for by local government tourist boards. It's all done relatively well. Interestingly Franco shoots both his women almost like these giant amazons that will destroy anything in their way. They might have just been tall women but they look a bit like dolled up Godzillas rampaging through the sets. It's fun in that they never seem ever even close to being in danger partially cause of the physicality they're exuding but also because both actresses are acting like they are playing a game. Rosanna Yanni in particular seems to really play up that angle. It's fun.

I can't recommend this to just anyone. It's weird. It's cut. It's feminist but not in a way current prudish 3rd wave feminism can understand. It's a specific product that people with a certain sense of humor can enjoy at least.",1503014400,,1617,4.591695501730104

7889876,5,630546345X,"I love Jess Franco films, and this is one of his frothiest.  No sex, but suggestiveness and madcap comedy abounds.  A stylish, tongue-in-cheek twist, lightly ghoulish, effusive, with a pair of ahead-of-the-game gals.  Probably not the best place to start watching Jess Franco films, but if watched the right way, this film just might make you happy.",1098662400,5,349,5.087719298245614
7889877,2,630546345X,"The taped I viewed claimed to be a widescreen version, but this turned out to be completely untrue.
In spite of the title SADISTEROTICA is not particularly sadistic OR erotic. It's uncut in NZ with an unrestricted rating, so in case you think by buying this movie you will be getting something provocative, controversial and gory/explicit, you'll be very disappointed. You get one topless gogo dancer halfway into the movie, but that's about all.
The story concerns a couple of sexy female PIs who are pursuing a ""sadistic"" artist and his lumbering neanderthal henchman, who murders female models while they are being drawn.
Sound good doesn't it? It ain't. Mostly SADISTEROTICA is just long-winded 60s pop art, but it's still better than that Warhol garbage (eg: TRASH- awful movie). I haven't seen any other Jesus ""Jess"" Franco movies to date so I can't compare this, but surely they must be better. I'll have to look out for AWFUL DR. ORLOFF and ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN. That is if the latter isn't banned in NZ. It better not be.",1034294400,2,1032,4.803370786516854
7889878,3,630546345X,"...or even the experienced, err, Francophile.  ""Two Undercover Angels"" reminds one of a tall soda, appealing at first glance but ultimately filled with empty calories.  In this film, two attractive women live together as a detective agency called ""Red Lips.""  The redhead (Jeanine Reynaud of the far superior ""Succubus"") is the brains of the group and seems almost like a poor man's Jane Fonda.  The blonde, whose name I forget, seems airheaded but is a master of disguise.  Little information is given of their backgrounds, which might have been helpful.  They investigate a series of strange murders involving an art gallery, and director Franco makes a cameo as a toady who angers his employer.  A wearwolf-like man known as ""Morpho"" (a common name in Franco's movies) also shows up.  All in all, it's a confused mess, although there is some eye candy to be found, mostly in the Mediterranean setting, the two female leads, and an extended striptease scene set to ultra-groovy '60s mamba music.",1018915200,5,997,5.0
7889879,2,630546345X,"Don't kid yourself this one is dreadful! But there is something funny about watching a couple of woman running around with a bomb looking for the perfect place to throw it to escape being blown up, while they deliver the most outrageous (stupid) lines which are suppose to be witty. This is one of my favorate, So bad it's funny films.",1000771200,,335,4.508196721311475
7889880,5,630546345X,Oh my this is bad. But the lines are so wonderful. The flat awful dubbing makes it all funnier. I rolled on the floor laughing laughing as rhe girls running around with a ticking vase of flowers and their discoving the secret of the statue. I bought the Collector's edition and am delighted with this monstrosity.,995760000,2,313,4.607142857142857
7889881,1,630546345X,"From the brash dialog to the annoying characters to the nonsensical narrative to the lackluster editing --- this has got to be one of the most grating films Jess Franco has ever done (and that's saying a lot!).  The  same characters were in Franco's ""Kiss Me Monster"", but it's a  tossed coin to decide which movie is worse.  This one is also known as  ""Sadisterotica""  and is really a chore to sit through.",961113600,,407,4.506849315068493
