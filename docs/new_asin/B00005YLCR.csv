John (Keith Carradine) and his wife Lily (Farah Fawcett) live with their pretty and intelligent daughter; Larkin (Alison Pill) and John's mother Byrd  (Jean Stapleton).
One day a, baby, named Sophie, is left on their doorstep, with a note by her mother explaining that she will collect the baby when she is able to do so.
The baby is taken to the heart of the family, with some reluctance by John, who is unsure of what the consequences will be, but who learns to love the baby like the rest of the family.
My favourite character in the film was Larkin, through whose eyes we can much understanding of the problems faced by the family, and who is the sparkling star of this human drama.
It is the sensitive child, Larkin, who reminds us that `""Everything has a name and a place. Even stars.""--",1069286400,10,876,4.475

7956956,5,B00005YLCR,"I fell in love with this movie  when I saw it years ago on TNT and I got the VHS tape and watched it over and over. I have been hunting for it in DVD and FINALLY it is here! It is worth the higher price! The acting and writing in this movie is the very best ever! I think this is my favorite movie!! EVERY actor in this movie gives it his/her all and it is a sensitive and lovely story: loss and recovering from it. I felt like my heart would literally burst at times, but these characters go  through it all and excel!
The movie is like living poetry and art...it is a balm to the soul and eyes as well.
I love it and I believe others will too!!!
This movie gave me another view on how to handle/get through heart break. It is a jewel!",1391040000,5,736,3.9

7956959,1,B00005YLCR,"I orginally read the story from which this movie is adapted from and was blown away by the powerful story about regaining family after loss. But, this movie does not live up to the story that bears it's name and honestlessly it's like watching a lifetime movie- it's script lacks depth, feeling, and emotion that was in the book plus the melodramatic acting make this movie a real bore.

The story starts when a child is left on their doorstep bearing a note from it's mother saying she could no longer care for the child but, would come back for her one day. The big twist the Malone recently lost a baby boy-- and they are a little hestitant about bringing a child into their home and loving it knowing, that one day it will be taken from them. Sophie quickly becomes a part of their lives with first steps, first words, and flus the family grow to love the little girl especially big sister Larkin who has been struggling to deal with the death of her little brother- who her parents were too grief-stricken to name. Quickly Larkin realizes she must protect her parents from the inevitable loss they must soon face as she hides letters that Sophie's mother dutifully sends to the little baby. Once Larkin's secret is revealed the house realizes it must come clean about all secrets uncluding the little baby... and just when the Malones have forgot not to get too attached Sophie's mother comes back to take the baby away.

All in all what ruined this movie was it's script and the performances the only performance that impressed me was the one done by Allison Pill who makes me remember a younger Scarlett Johansson. This movie in the end was nothing like what the book was like and not as charming all this movie was about is loss... This is a sobby movie yet, it dosn't manage to make me want to cry like the book did all in all this is not a movie I would not recommend.",1111449600,2,1878,4.440579710144927
