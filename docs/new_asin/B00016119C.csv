8278130,4,B00016119C,"I thought I had seen all of John Mills' films--his performances in Tunes of Glory and Hobson's Choice are among my favorites--but I had never heard of Car of Dreams.  It's apparently one of Mills' first films.  The plot is simple, but John Mills and Grete Mosheim are charming as the young lovers, and the character roles surrounding them add humor (how can one not laugh, for example, at an antique shop dealer whose failure is that he can't be persuaded to SELL the items in his store).  Miss Mosheim gets her first job in a factory owned by Mr. Mills' father.  What is her work?  ""Stamping,"" she says, and viewers will be surprised at how many different (and mistaken) responses she gets to the simple word ""stamping.""  Her life changes when Mills gives her a Rolls-Royce.  The charm of the film is its light-heartedness:  it IS a film of dreams.  But it keeps you laughing, sometimes at the campiness of it and other times at the clever twists and turns in this comedy of mistaken identity.  An added plus: both sound and picture are of high quality.",1106870400,7,1054,4.558510638297872
