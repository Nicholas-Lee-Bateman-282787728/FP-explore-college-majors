1356700,4,B00004UEEN,"Every once in a while comes a great little gem of a film.  This can easily be said for ""In The Flesh"".  Directed by Ben Taylor and starring Dane Ritter as the cute but not so innocent hustler, this hits right at home for ALL viewers straight or gay.  Ed Corbin stars as a vice cop that is hesitant to take a case involving drug traffic in a gritty gay bar.  There he befriends Dane Ritter the hustler and the two fall in love.  Suddenly both are plunged into a nightmarish hell when a murder is committed and the cop risks his job for his new found lover insisting he is innocent of the crime.  Soon the hustler becomes the hustled when he becomes the target of a murderer. What remains is the two attempting to stay alive amid corruption and greed in a seedy suburb of Atlanta.  Still we are left with the question for money or love?  Pay close attention to the bar,....but if youv'e been to or live in Atlanta you probably know that already.",979171200,18,943,4.258426966292135
1356701,3,B00004UEEN,"This movie, shot on a low budget, shows some surprising competency in its crisp editing and nicely lit cinematography, and it is a pleasure to see a movie set somewhere else other than L.A. or New York.  In this case the locale is Atlanta, where a young hustler (Dane Ritter) is implicated in the brutal murder of one of his johns.  A sympathetic detective (Ed Corbin) provides the boy with an alibi and a place to stay until the storm blows over. Of course the cop is a closet case, and mutual feelings develop between the two men.
So far, so good.  The movie's downsides include some uneven acting.  Corbin, who is certainly easy on the eyes, turns in a largely wooden performance and puts one uncomfortably in mind of Gregory Walcott, the square jawed lead from Ed Wood's legendary PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.  Still his bountiful physical charms often allay this discomfort, and the one stunning shot of his bare backside should have the viewer pressing the PAUSE button.  Ritter, on the other hand, is much more convincing as Oliver. Handsome in an unconventional way, he is magnetic, funny, thoughtful, and sexy.  With the right breaks he could find himself doing more mainstream roles.
The movie's biggest disappointment, however, is the rather chaste treatment of the male-male ""affair.""  Early in the movie there's a somewhat graphic shot of Oliver and his ""girlfriend"" enjoying l'amour (another nice moment for lovers of the male derriere), but there isn't even a kiss between Ritter and Corbin, and the viewer sits saying, frustratedly, ""Get on with it, you two! Get on with it!""  The excuse is the men do not want to cloud the purity of their feelings with sex.  Right.  Fine.  But no kiss?  One suspects instead squeamishness on the part of the two leads.
This is still fairly entertainly and worth a look for the curious.",972864000,14,1835,4.768987341772152
1356702,3,B00004UEEN,"Ben Taylor came up with a great premise upon which to build this story: a deeply closeted cop is assigned to investigate a gay hustler bar where he unexpectedly starts a relationship with a young man who is eventually accused of murdering one of the patrons.  The cop decides to make himself the sole alibi for the young man and a precarious trust develops between these two very wary men.
This is a world Taylor apparently knows well, unfortunately he doesn't explore any of it deeply enough to make it particularly believable or compelling.  What there is of interest is in the growing relationship between the two central characters (played by Dane Ritter and Ed Corbin), an unlikely pair of actors who between them manage to elicit some nice moments out of a perfunctory script.  Too bad that so much of a compelling situation was left unexplored.  Still, the fact that the two main characters are falling in love rather than simply falling into bed with each other is very refreshing.
Don't be afraid to try it on. You may actually like it. With remote in hand you can skip the worst of it and stick with the main story.",970876800,15,1125,4.61
1356703,1,B00004UEEN,"Not only is the dialog at the level of a high school creative writing class, but the acting sinks to a style of delivery normally reserved for bad porn. There are even scenes where the actors point to something we (the ignorant viewers) are supposed to know is ""important.""  The dewy-eyed ""oh-so-hurt "" hustler (complete with a glycerine-induced tear running down one check) tantrums his way to happiness with his newfound cop ""daddy"". Anyone who says this is more than dreck, is probably hiding the fast forward time spent getting to the ""oh-so-sensitive"" nude scene. Watching this ""epic"" in its' entirety is more painful than most invasive medical procedures.  We are even subjected to the obligatory scene of old ""fresh young meat of the day"" is replaced by new ""fresh young meat of the day."" This takes place in the hallowed spot (reserved for fresh young meat gyrations) in front of the juke box.  So much for the wages of sin. In the old days directors had a church fall on the promiscuous evildoer during the last scene. The symbolism in ""In The Flesh"" is less subtle.  With so many quality gay-themed movies to choose from, put this  one last on the list, or better yet, rent the turkey on dollar night!",969580800,12,1211,4.693396226415095
1356704,5,B00004UEEN,"With the continuing boom in gay independent films surfacing, we are  enjoying a rich diversity in themes and perspectives. ""In The  Flesh"" provides an excellent character study of a young,  student/street hustler struggling with life, family and the prospect of  love with an older undercover Atlanta drug enforcement officer. This film  provides a refreshing antidote to the usual mainstream fare.  The DVD  includes deleted scenes and a good commentary track by writer/director Ben  Taylor. The film is certainly worthy of repeated viewing.",968025600,8,542,5.524390243902439
1356705,3,B00004UEEN,"I really enjoyed this film. The story, a sullen cop goes undercover to  find who is dealing drugs at a local gay bar. He winds up falling for one  of the regulars there who is a male prostitute with so many problems i  could never begin to list them all here. The two wind up sleeping together  and then things begin to get complicated. if your looking for a sweet love  story where the prince charming comes to the rescue this is it. you never  see the two characters actually have sex but as there attraction for each  other grows that will be hot enough.",967939200,2,557,4.247619047619048
1356706,3,B00004UEEN,"The plot screams ""exploitation!"" -- a vice-squad cop falls in love with a male hustler -- but the resulting film is subdued and even  thoughtful. (Perhaps too much so. There's virtually no sex in the movie  even though it's a sexual attraction that first bonds the unlikely pair.)  The movie, (filmed in Atlanta), has a professional look throughout and the  acting is better than what you might expect with the best work coming from  Dane Ritter as the bit-too-cleancut hustler. Ed Corbin can't do much with  the not-always-plausible role as the cop but he has a nice set of buns.",967766400,21,580,4.75
1356707,5,B00004UEEN,"Almost anything is better than a big budget Hollywood movie.  I have to chuckle while reading some of the reveiws of In The Flesh because people are saying the story, the scenes, the acting are all implausible.  Have you watched a Hollywood movie lately??  Even the rolling credits of those movies are implausible.

I know guys exactly like Phillip Kirsch...the strong, brooding, silent type.  And Oliver is the unlikely prostitute with a heart of gold.  Many viewed this movie as a gay detective-murder-mystery movie.  I didn't.  I saw it as a struggling love story between to supposed opposites--a cop and a prostitute.  Both Phillip and Oliver are sruggling to find middle ground.  Oliver is stuck doing what he does in order to keep perpetuating a bad situation--supporting his sister's drug habit.  Phillip comes off as the straight laced, pure cop who struggles to enjoy life and have fun.

I think the movie is much more complex that first meets the eye.  I think there is much more to the alibi than meets the eye.  Does Phillip provide Oliver with an alibi because he fell instantly in love with him or does Phillip, as a cop, instinctively know that Oliver didn't do it and therefore doesn't want to see an innocent person get charged with a crime?

One reviewer wrote that the only people who like this film are those who aren't used to seeing gay themed films....WRONG!  I primarily watch gay themed films, have seem hundreds of them....and I still loved In the Flesh.",1123372800,5,1480,4.767716535433071
1356708,3,B00004UEEN,"The story in this film is interesting and fairly believable, and the lead actors are pretty good, considering this is a gritty independent film.  Some of the minor actors (the police, the hustlers, the ""girlfriend,"" etc.) are laughable actors, but it's not terribly distracting.

Evidently my formative years with strict literature teachers didn't have any affect on some film-makers like this one, who introduces a girlfriend and a bunch of hustlers for absolutely no reason.  He talks in some of the commentary about whether a certain character was necessary for the film.  Here's some advice: If it isn't important to the development of the main characters or plot, it isn't necessary.

As a gay action movie, I liked it, and appreciated some fairly daring bare assets, but missed any hint of the boys even kissing?  What was the problem with that?

Don't look for great extras on this DVD either, as the deleted scenes take about 2 minutes to watch, and the director's commentary is boring and repetitive:  ""We got real lucky that (such and such actor) was available.""  It would have been more interesting to hear from the actors.

The ending was sorta unsatisfying too, but better than some others.  Don't see this first, but it's worth renting and can be appreciated for the effort it took and its occasional success.",1114646400,,1323,4.914414414414415
1356709,4,B00004UEEN,"This movie has a lot going for it.  The two lead characters are both attractive and competent actors.  The supporting cast, all with little or no prior acting experience, are all excellent.
The script could be a little better.  There are a few unlikely moments and some of the plot points were muddled and confusing, but overall it held my interest throughout.  It has the advantage of not being the typical gay themed movie.  It's just a story about people, and their sexuality is secondary.
It does not have the look of a typical low budget movie.  It shows what a producer and director can do without much money, but with the talent to make the most of limited resources.  A bigger budget would not have made the movie any better.
Dane Ritter and Ed Corbin are both talented actors.  They achieve a level of believability in their roles that is rarely seen in low budget movies.
Ben Taylor wrote the script and directed.
He managed to do a lot with a small budget, but also with the advantages of a good cast and a lot of creativity.
This is definitely worth seeing.",1088035200,5,1069,4.5025906735751295
1356710,1,B00004UEEN,"Now and then you come across a movie that is so lame even the idea of describing it makes you feel slightly tired.  And IN THE FLESH is so lame in so many different directions that trying to give it a legitimate review is major uphill work.
The story has been done a thousand times, but here it is given a  gay-appeal twist. Undercover cop and closeted homosexual Philip (Ed Corbin) is working a possible drug ring operating out of a gay bar.  When he meets male prostitute Oliver (Dane Ritter) it's love at first sight--but then one of Oliver's regular tricks is murdered and suspicion falls on Oliver.  Philip gives him an alibi and then sets out to find the real killer.
Will Philip find the killer?  Will Oliver give up hooking and finish his college degree?  Will the two live happily ever after?  Frankly, the thing is so badly done it's impossible to care.  I really feel sorry for the cast.  When they saw this movie it must have been a shock for them to discover they have no talent.  But I have no sympathy for writer-director Ben Taylor.  His script is amazingly awful and his idea of direction is to hold the camera on his actors just long enough for them to look stupid.
The only people who might find this movie appealing are those who have never before seen a gay-themed film of any kind.  If you're one of them, trust me: there are many, many gay-themed films that are much, much better than this one.  So give it a miss.  IN THE FLESH is wasted time you won't ever get back.

1356711,3,B00004UEEN,"I've read some of the not-so-positive reviews for this movie and I'll have to agree on some points...the writing is weak.  But...I disagree on the actors being bad.  I found them believable, both of them.  I can usually tell when two actors are able to have chemistry and these two have it in spades.  Sure, the lack of sexual encounter is more based on the cop's not wanting to take advantage of his somewhat 'vulnerable' lover.  Young lover is taking psych in college, but it's the cop that's got the psyche down pat.  When Oliver offers him sex free of charge as payment for taking him in, Phillip says, ""I've had it[the sex].  It's not about that."" I think it's great there's a gay film out there that shows a gay guy who's hot for another gay guy, and yet he practices restraint.  It focuses on the romance of the characters rather than the plot or the sexual connotation.  The cuddling in the bed is touching and when Oliver tries to sabotage the relationship, Ole' Phillip won't back down and literally slugs Oliver to get him out of the 'whorehouse'.  It's not a dominant/submissive kind of coupling.  It's balanced.  Both have their strong and weak points.
The writing ..., it's flimsy, but I ignored the writing in favor of watching the relationship develop.  Plus...I loved the music!!  Somebody please tell me how to get a copy of ""Had To Let You Go!"" GRRRRRRRRR",1047427200,4,1374,4.600823045267489
1356712,2,B00004UEEN,"Well I have watched this film on both DVD and video. The problem with this film centers on the writing and what the director thinks gay means. First the good points- and there are few: The actors are very handsome, the music is interesting, the camera angles can be good. The writing has the taste of a bad Rockford Files. No one talks as though the words mean anything and no one has the passion it takes to ride over the lack of words. The plot-so thin and meaningless- is also confused and weird : Are the main characters gay or just acting, Is Oliver going to school, selling his [rear] or working at Towers, Can he really love a sister who he enables and why not arrest him for that? Also a gay movie were I see hetro sex and no homo sex, where the main guys never kiss, where we are never sure how they  feel about being is not a gay film. Ben Taylor is more confused than his actors- he makes the women far more appealing than the men. I see a film that had promise if the director wasn't scare of being gay and real. I also see a film- that written on its own level- might not have been bad. But the film suffers because the writer/director is suffering and doesn't the sense to know that.",1028505600,7,1197,4.1594827586206895
1356713,2,B00004UEEN,"A low, and I mean low, budget indie centering around a steroid pumped cop and very attractive rent boy. It's set and was filmed in Atlanta and much of it takes place at a gay bar. The cop is established as a loner and is not to thrilled to be sent undercover to the fags bar to break a drug ring that is supposedly working out of it. He goes in and tries to fit in and rather ludicrously sits at the bar drinking beer alone declining to talk to anyone. I think they would all smell a cop a mile away, but not in this flick. The bar also acts as a defacto house of gay male prostitution, they have rooms above the bars, and one evening a handsome college type boy dances sensually by himself in his trademark red jeans and captures the attention of big burly cop. They chat, agree on a price and head upstairs. Mr. macho cop is queer! Big shock. The rest of the film is about the murder of a John, cute rental, red jean wearing boys getting framed for it, and big macho cop making up an alibi for him because he loves him. Will rental boy return his love, will the murderers get caught, will the other cops embrace queer cop once he comes out?
The whole thing was rather contrived and looks like an amateur production. It was clearly a labor of love and I suspect a lot more daring in it's day. The film was released in 1997. I would guess it was in production in the mid 90's.
*One big plus, rental boy is attractive but the sex scenes between him and burly macho cop are lame. You get the distinct impression that both of them are straight and the whole thing seems forced. Also be warned:  The artwork used to promote the DVD/Video has bears no resemblence to the film.",1024358400,8,1671,4.173374613003096

Slowly, I find it a good film about gay love. I can't belive a gay movie can be so good. The acting of all the actors is good, in the 102 minites, we get into two mens heart. In the film, I frist to close the gays. Whatever i say, you just need to watch it, tell us your feeling.",1012262400,2,546,3.635593220338983
1356715,3,B00004UEEN,"In my mind, ""In the Flesh"" belongs to the second wave of queer cinema.  The first wave were the coming out stories where the existence of gay characters and themes was to explore what it means to be gay.  In the second wave, the gay characters exist not solely to be gay, but on an equal playing field where their homosexuality is simply part of who they are in the context of a larger story.  In this case, the story is a murder mystery.  As refreshing as it is to have a story with gay characters where the story isn't about being gay and as agreeable as the movie is on many levels, it's not a very good murder mystery.
Oliver (Dane Ritter) is a hustler in Atlanta and thankfully writer/director Ben Taylor doesn't make him into the two stereotypes you often find in movies about prostitutes--he is neither the whore with the heart of gold, nor is he a strung-out junkie hustling just to get his next fix.  Philip (Ed Corbin) is a cop assigned to investigate drug dealing happening at the Blue Boy, a bar where gay hustlers meet their johns.  Philip and Oliver get to talking and connect on some levels.  Philip hires Oliver, they have sex, and Philip tries to make their connection more than economic.  Oliver resists.  When one of Oliver's regular johns is murdered, Philip intervenes in the investigation, providing Oliver with an alibi and walking away from his job.  The scandal causes Oliver to lose his apartment, Philip invites him to move in, and the two become enmeshed in the murder mystery with Oliver and Philip in danger.
I'm sure I just made it sound more logical than it actually is.  Unfortunately, the relationship that is supposed to drive all of the action, that between Oliver and Philip doesn't work.  Part of this is writer/director Taylor's fault.  (He admits that it moves too quickly and that he had to cut a scene that explained how the relationship developed.  In his commentary track, he says that the cut scene is on the DVD.  Unfortunately, it's not, so we'll never know if the scene would have explained everything or not.)  However, actor Ed Corbin has to take some of the blame as well.  He never projects any real warmth, so it's hard to believe that Philip has fallen in love with Oliver.  Dane Ritter's performance is stronger than Corbin's, but I don't sense any romantic or sexual heat from him either.  Because of this, it's hard to believe that Philip would risk his career to help Oliver.  If you don't believe that, then the rest of the movie becomes difficult to accept.
On top of that, there is a secret from Oliver's past that is revealed in the course of the movie that both defies logic and police procedure.  I don't want to give the specifics away here, but it doesn't work for me.  On one level, if you know anything about police procedure, the secret won't work for you the secret defies police procedure.  (""Law & Order"" and ""C.S.I."" fans beware!  The strange thing is, Taylor says in his commentary that the scene is based on actual events--although they took place in South Africa--if I recall correctly--so that may explain the difference in crime scene investigation. Unfortunately, the movie's version doesn't, so it's hard to believe that American police investigators didn't see through this lie.)  I simply don't believe the events could have happened the way they are described.  And, in revealing this truth, Philip has to accept something that he as an officer of the law should not be so quick to dismiss.
If you can overlook those flaws (and I do, up to a point), this is an enjoyable enough film with a reversal at the end that I appreciated.  Some of Taylor's commentary track is truly interesting, although I think he tells us much more about his personal life than he needs to.
My suggestion is that you rent the film before you invest in it.  If you like this, then I highly suggest you check out ""Rites of Passage.""  You might also like ""Skin & Bone"" (which I don't care for personally) and the French film ""Criminal Lovers"" (another that I don't care for, but at least find more interesting than ""Skin & Bone"").

The reason I am adding a review deals with the quality of the DVD.  The entire Pro Logic audio track sounds as if the film is under water.  I needed to disable Pro Logic and play the film with just my two front speakers.  Watch out for this.  I do not recommend purchasing this DVD due to the poor sound quality, which doesn't restrict itself to just the movie.  The extras on the DVD also suffer from this problem.",1003622400,4,663,4.306451612903226
1356719,2,B00004UEEN,"A few hackneyed plot twists I can forgive, as long as the plot is lucid enough to keep them in an order that's pleasing to the eye. But ""In The Flesh"" crosses the line, throwing so many twists at us that are predictable and shallow, and ruin what could potentially pass as a good movie. But that, along with boring characters played by actors who seem to have little interest in the plot, drags the movie into the depths of a Blockbuster rental bin, to be looked at and passed over for something better.
Don't let the twists fool you: the plot is simpler than the producers would have you think. It centers around closeted detective Philip Kirsch (Ed Corbin), who has been assigned to working a local gay bar, believed to be an underground drug ring. There, he trades many furtive glances with regular hustler Oliver (Dane Ritter), and the two hook up for a night.
And wouldn't you know it, that big, hulking, macho cop Philip finds his soft spot once again? He follows Oliver around like a lost puppy, searching his medical files (isn't he a cop?), coming to his rescue as his alibi when Oliver becomes the prime suspect in a suspense-less murder case, and inviting him to live in his house until he finds a place of his own. But the real killer is still at large, and so are Oliver's less-than-interesting feelings of mistrust and inner torment.
So what does all of this result in? A lot of frustration for the viewers, especially those of us who would like to see something, ANYTHING, happen to these characters of any interest. Oh, there are moments, ones that tease us, making us think something big is about it happen, but nothing comes of it.
Take the relationship between the two leads, for example. Simple logic tells us that, in any independent gay film, if two men find themselves attracted to one another, then we will at least be granted the privilege of seeing some hot lip-locking. In ""In The Flesh,"" we get to see a gratuitous sex scene between a male and female, but not so much as a puckering of lips for our stumbling casanovas.
If that isn't disappointing enough, the plot is a mess. It throws in secondary characters for its own convenience, such as Oliver's sister, who is a junkie that has become so dependant on narcotics that she will die without them. This provides an explanation for the drugs Philip finds in Oliver's belongings. One of Philip's cop buddies will play a role in the film's finale, in a contrived twist that seems desperate and tired.
I don't know which of the characters I disliked more: the wooden, macho Philip, or hustler Oliver, the martyr of the movie whose several outbursts of emotional turmoil are more of an annoyance than a relatable feeling. The movie wants to be provocative in portraying how people builds emotional blocks when a catastrophic event traumatizes their lives, but it comes off as cheesy and unbelievable, and even actions the characters take reverse our emotions for them, even turning us against them.
I wanted to like ""In the Flesh,"" because I enjoy movies that aren't afraid to take on gay subject matter. But that doesn't mean that every movie I see with this type of material is going to be an Oscar-worthy effort. In fact, this is one of the most emotionless attempts I've seen in a while. You have to give it credit as an independent film, for being a mark higher than other films, but everything in this movie is hit-or-miss, and what's going on in these characters' heads is anyone's guess.",1003017600,10,3470,4.625607779578607

Oliver Beck, the main character, is the best part of the movie. I loved his relationship with his sister, tragic though it was. I also enjoyed the way he begins to let his guard down with Phillip over the course of the film.

Well, it really sounds wonderful, but with the whole script and screenplay like that, their acting wouldn't be better whatsoever.  It's well-intentioned, but a big disappointment.",985824000,6,396,5.0
1356725,2,B00004UEEN,"This film has a few interesting scenes, but it has some mighty silly ones, too. The gentleman who plays the cop seems destined for the next Hercules cycle. Mugs mostly. At the beginning of the film, he seems to disdain the thought of gay sex. He sure does change his tune in a hurry, and without much fanfare. Oh, and the mystery aspect? The buddy did it. That's certainly original.
The little guy who plays the hustler holds his own. Not much character development in the film, so he has to wing it. Does a decent job. Can't recommend the film, though.",980553600,2,553,4.431372549019608

7923980,4,B00004UEEN,"There's no way I can give this film five stars simply because it is a low budget film and that is too evident in too many ways.  That said, I do love this film, which I've now watched twice.  I know a lot of people won't like it because I don't think any of the five people who watched it with me liked it at all.  I think perhaps it's a matter of the main character (and actor) appealing to you, which they did to me.  I was engaged by the plot, cared about the characters, and found myself thinking about the film long after I'd seen it.  So, four stars, recognizing its weaknesses but also giving it kudos for appealing to me personally.  Perhaps you will love it too.",1307923200,,671,4.123076923076923
7923981,4,B00004UEEN,"This film doesn't cling to every gay stereotype there is, like most gay films do. It contains a certain amount of surprises that make it memorable and worthy of repeat viewing. It doesn't focus on one-night stands or fey melodrama, and the ""jaded barflies"" are given small parts to play. Consequently, various persuasions of ""drama queens"" appear to dislike it and give it low marks. The main characters of this film, Oliver (played by Ritter)and Phillip (played by Corbin) make no excuses for who or what they are: two masculine men with serious intimacy issues who are drawn together by a series of incriminating circumstances. Gradually, each man looks to the other for deliverance though neither readily admits it. Sex equates ""taking"" and love equates ""giving."" Unlike the cheap role-play sex he engages in for money, Dane Ritter's character, Oliver, learns love has a price, and that price has to be both earned and paid over time. Sexy Ritter's seamless portrayal of a streetwise and tough, but haunted and hurting, male hustler holds your interest and carries the movie into the ""gay hall of fame.""",1304553600,2,1106,4.9837837837837835
7923982,4,B00004UEEN,"Based on the film's title, the graphics on the DVD case showing shirtless boys leaning against cars, and the DVD tag line - ""When you work the streets, trust is the first thing to go"" - a prospective viewer might easily presume that ""In the Flesh"" is a soft porn melodrama about young male prostitutes working the mean streets.  But such a presumption would be a mistake.  Writer-director Ben Taylor's film is actually an engaging (if somewhat slowly paced) whodunnit with an interesting twist, involving a romance between a closeted cop and a sex club hustler suspected of murder.

Beautifully photographed and ably directed, ""In the Flesh"" boasts two superior performances by Ed Corbin as the intense older cop and Dane Ritter as the troubled young suspect.  There are some major plot holes in Taylor's script, but the two leading actors manage to gloss them over through their individual charisma and the odd (but ultimately compelling) chemistry they generate between them.  Actress Alex Dawson lends fine support as Chloe, Ritter's jilted coworker, and there is also notable work by Adele Phares as Ritter's junkie sister and Roxzane Mims as Corbin's forceful lieutenant.

Despite the fact that ""In the Flesh"" is actually more centered around characters than plot, the ultimate revelation of the film's villain provided a neat little surprise.  Overall, this film seems to have polarized most viewers, with half of them loathing it and the other half cheering it.  Put me in the latter category.  In all fairness, I would suspect that some of the naysayers were at least to some degree set up to be disappointed by the false expectations created by the film's dishonest marketing campaign ... and who can blame them?  The film should have been sold on its own merits, which I found to be plentiful.  Recommended to those seeking a thoughtful, sensual mystery; audiences craving action and heavy sexuality probably should look elsewhere.",1278201600,,1941,5.053291536050157

It was well written, cinematographically excellent and the performances of Dane Ritter and Ed Corbin were both human and honest, without resorting to sensationalist sex/nudity. And THAT, to me, is what great film-making is all about!

Hustler drives tricks car away, and leaves car, and fingerprints for the police to trace.  Now the hustler is a suspect.  Now why didn't he report it???  Because he didn't want the police to know he was a hustler, and providing drugs to his chemically dependant strung out sister.  He eventually falls in love with an undercover cop, and they go off into the sunset together, after a few interesting moments.  The cop (corbin) has these eyes, that widen like he is in a hypnotic trance.  Lots of scenes of men in a gay bar, and the ones hanging on the streets, look like they are all on queludes.

In the Flesh takes on quite a task, and it does so well. Oliver (Dane Ritter) is the sexiest guy working the hustler bar. He's 21, he's a full-time student, he comes from money, he has the looks....and he's been using them, every night, for years. Then one night, life gets quite a bit more complicated. First, he catches the eye of an older man, Philip (Ed Corbin). Little does he know, Philip is an undercover cop trying to bust the place for drugs. Turns out, however, drugs take a back seat to

attraction, and Mr. Cop develops quite the interest in Mr. Sex Worker. Needless to say, the disaster has only begun. Soon thereafter, Oliver becomes a suspect in a murder case when one of his regulars dies in a car wreck. What ensues is an extremely difficult series of decisions for everyone -- does Philip trust Oliver? Does Oliver trust Philip? When does a trick become a life-changing partner? Can they both dig themselves out? Why did all this happen?

I'm not going to say that In the Flesh is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely good. It's unique, intense, at times entertaining, certainily thought-provoking, and overall, a fresh breath from the average gay movie.",1136419200,,1358,4.745762711864407

In the Flesh. the story of the timid relationship

between a very Hot! vice cop and a clean cut middle class

male postitute. Could have been a much better film that it

was.

 The dialog and the scenes looked as if it was lifted from

a bad 70's cop tv series!

The only saving grace for the film is that you get to salivate

over Ed Corbin's very big, and very hot body! Almost worth

the price!

 Perhaps this could have been a better film if a more daring

studio had made it.

With a better script and a little more sex, it would've been

great!",1125619200,,596,4.060869565217391
