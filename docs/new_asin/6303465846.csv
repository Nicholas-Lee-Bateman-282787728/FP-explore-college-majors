658757,5,6303465846,"What a terrible hard part Weaver had to play, and she did it beautifully, and made you believe it. Gosh, if Sigourney doesn't get an oscar soon there is no such thing as justice. But I digress. Death and the Maiden is a tale  of revenge, ironically reversing the roles of innocent victim and ruthless  villian. The audience doesn't know whether to sympathize with Paulina or be  downright scared of her, which is pretty much the same dilemma her husband  is in. Kingsley is good as well... and I found myself thinking, oh he's not  such a bad guy. Any guy who quotes Nietzsche can't be that bad, right? Ha  ha. At least, I *think* it was Nietzsche. (Truth is, watch out for those  guys that quote Nietzsche, or Freud for that matter.) But again, I digress.  See this movie if you like any of the three actors. They're all very good.

658859,4,6303465846,"One of those Polanski films that played cinemas for a week. I remember Sciskle and Ebert reviewed it. I never saw it at the cinema, so I purchased it for home viewing. This is a great Polanski film. It reminds me of"" Knife in Water "" in that it has only three characters in it. The tension between them is thick. Sigourney Weaver is tremendous in a stand out performance. It all starts when she recognizes the voice of a man who drove her husband home after he got a flat tire. She believes the man is a man who raped and tortured her years earlier. While her husband sleeps, she knocks him out and ties him to a chair. She must then convince her husband that the man was the fiend who abused her. The cat and mouse dialog continues til the end of the film. There is an unexpected ending where both parties leave satisfied. Leave it to Polanski.
Another note, This title was in Spanish, but the film was spoken in English by the cast in their voices(not dubbed). I was initially afraid it was not in English. It is in English ,but has Spanish subtitles.",1425254400,4,1053,4.296482412060302

She has no doubts.  Was it him or wasn't it?  What is the righty thing to do?  You will see a war of morals and the husband who wants to support his wife but questions her intentions and actions.

 Many reviewers wonder why the film didn't get a better reception.  I think, frankly, that it's hard to watch.  Weaver plays a character who, understandably, is so damaged that she is not easy to like.  We feel deeply for what she has endured, theoretically, but watching her in maniacal revenge is difficult.  She looks terrible, stressed to the max, again understandably, but it's hard to care about her, as shown in this one dimension.  If the film had shown other aspects of her character, some warmth, or tenderness, some glimpse of the young woman the man had fallen in love with, she'd be much easier for the audience to warm up to.  This way, showing just one night, all we see is the terrible wreckage of a woman and the desperate act she is willing to perform for her revenge.  Artistically this just makes the film hard to watch and I can see why it wasn't more popular.  I",1408752000,,1063,4.49738219895288

The very best thing about this story by Ariel Dorfman is the opportunity he gives you to see all sides of the situation--the victim of torture, the perpetrator of torture and the person who is trying to help a people and government heal.

 Our group had read the script, saw a production and then watched the film. Some significant changes from the play but generally more satisfying for those who don't like vague endings.  And the acting was better than what we had in the production!!",1406592000,,533,4.688172043010753

Years after she was assaulted she came into contact with the perpetrator.
He had never been made responsible for his actions by the courts.
At this stage mystery really enters the movie.  The perpetrator has the status of being a doctor and well to do figure.  He takes the husband of the woman home one night when he stops to help the husband at a car with a flat tyre and no spare.
When they get to the couples house the woman recognises him from his voice and some sayings he uses.

659033,5,6303465846,"An extremely serious film that is full of psychological tension from beginning to end.  Weaver's performance as a former torture victim in South America  is flawless.  She maintains her character on the line between sane and insane brilliantly.  She never saw her torturer, because she was blindfolded.  But her husband helps a man whose car has gone of the road near their home, and brings him to the house while waiting for a two.  Weaver's hairs immediately stand on end and the action truly begins here.  She is 100% confident that this man is her torturer - from his voice.  Her husband does not know whether or not to believe her.  Weaver crosses the line into insanity and the rest of the film is a hair-raising journey that she takes regarding what to do with this man, played beautifully by Ben Kingsley.  This film is a tense, psychological tour de force.  Intense is an understatement.  One of Weaver's best performances.",1387670400,2,932,4.75625

In total, there were only 3 actors in this film which all take palce in a small home.

659126,5,6303465846,"Before going further, let it be said that this is not a movie you will want to watch on a date Friday evening. This is very tough stuff and can be a little depressing. There are only three people playing in this movie (this is an adaptation of a piece of theatre): the woman (Sigourney Weaver), her husband (Stuart Wilson) and the guest (Ben Kingsley). It happens in a non precised country in Latin America after the revolution, and the husband was just asked by the newly elected democratic president to chair a commission investigating the crimes of the fallen military regime.

The woman is a former victim of the junta - we know she was imprisoned for years and tortured at many occasions. And then arrives the guest... and his voice seems familiar to the woman. She believes that he is the man who tortured her years ago and decides to make him pay. What happens next? Well, you will have to watch the movie, because all of this was just the beginning...

All the cast is great but Sigourney Weaver is simply incredible. This is one of her most powerful performances ever - if you are a fan, you simply MUST see this movie.

This is a very difficult film. If you search to have some fun and spend a nice evening, it should not be your first choice. But if you need something harder, more difficult, more ambitious, different from the mainstream works, well, here it is. The movie has also a very clear ""Polanski touch"", which I personally always loved - and that means it is very smart, very surprising, but somehow just a little bit creepy...

659181,3,6303465846,"Death and the Maiden is overall a very good drama. Roman Polanski creates another ""Repulsion"", this time with two additional characters. Based on a play and doesn't attempt to hide it's stage origins, the film flows remarkably well and doesn't get long winded.

It relies heavily on good performances and Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley are more than up to the task. Weaver is particularly effective as the film plays on viewer's emotions and for a good period of time, one doesn't know at all who's to blame and who deserves pity.

There's not much in the way of directorial touches that scream out POLANSKI, but as in ""Repulsion"", he milks the isolated setting for all it's worth.",1235347200,6,684,4.788135593220339
659182,5,6303465846,"I have to agree with Donna Di Giacomo's review, and seemingly every other post, in disagreeing with Amazon's review, which classifies Weaver's performance as ""underwhelming"". I always found her portrayal in the film to be incredible! She more than holds her own with Ben Kingsley, who has always been one of our greatest actors. In fact, it seems to me that since the mid-90's, when this was released, Weaver has been given more recognition as a serious actor. Roman Polanski is often at his best with these modest, tension-filled little stories (Knife In The Water).
I also wanted to respond to the review stating, ""Living in a democrasy(sic) it is hard to fathom the incredle(sic) cruelty of a dictatorship."" I saw this film tonight after watching hours of news programs in which our new Democratic Administration actually wrestled with the idea of possible commitees/investigations/prosecutions of the Bush administration's practice of Rendition, Torture, Illegal CIA Black Sites, Illegal Detention of Prisoners, etc. etc. The other option, and it seems to be their preferred method, is to sweep it all under the rug and look the other way. We already know much of what has been committed in our name is Awful, Unconstitutional & we have already created many more human beings who must deal with the Destructive after-effects that Torture brings to the soul.
A very meaningful film such as this cannot be seen as Theatrical-Hypothetical but viewed as Very Real; This is what happens when governments 'Dictatorial' or 'Democratic' lose their souls and wreak havoc on others. There is Never a 'Good' excuse. This film confronted me with the issue and for that it should be seen.",1234310400,,1679,5.064981949458484

Though Weaver is often outacted by her two costars, this adaptation of Dorfman's play is so consistently interesting and thought-provoking that it more than makes up for Sigourney's occasional lapses; with a clever structure, interesting background, and great monologue by Kingsley at the end, it's an underrated treasure.",1233532800,,340,5.666666666666667

659186,4,6303465846,"Roman Polanski. With Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Stuart Wilson

This movie probes into a topic that is rather controversial. The process of justice punishes criminals that commit crimes to sentences that remove their freedom and have tremendous impact morally because of the stigma created by the trial and jail time. But... how do we punish crimes against humanity that were sanctioned by a government?

The process of justice is also created so victims find vindication and can go on with their lives after the person ""pays"" for the inflicted crime or damage. In this movie, Sigourney Weaver plays the role of a woman who was brutally assaulted while held captive by men acting on behalf of a previous government. A doctor who was supposed to make the process safe for the victims, participates during her captivity and given so much power, he falls pray to his own devils and inflicts further injury on this woman during her ordeal. Back then she was blind-folded, so she recognizes in the doctor... by smell and voice sound, the man who made her suffer unspeakable torture.

The roles are reversed and she now has the power to extract vengeance and she sets out to get the doctor to confess what he had done to her. She wants retribution... she wants the doctor to suffer psychologically as much as she endured, but time is short and we see a give and take that is frightening, always wandering whether the doctor is indeed guilty, or the innocent stranger that triggers the memories of horrific torture. The movie leaves you with the sense that the punishment of crimes is a terrifying process because as we attempt to extract vengeance, we have to turn into the very character that we despise. If you come from a background where you and or yours have suffered due to political differences, you will find that this movie probes into the very issues that force thousands if not millions into exile.",1221436800,3,1907,4.7902735562310035
659187,3,6303465846,"If you have read the play by Ariel Dorfman, I think you will find this movie adpatation to be wanting.  Though there are fine performances by Weaver and Kingsley, Polanski connects too many of the dots for the viewer, leaving little doubt as to the credibility (or madness) of the main characters.  It was this very ambiguity that made the play so enjoyable, but this is not evident in the DVD.",1196380800,3,394,4.535211267605634
659188,5,6303465846,"I don't think Sigourney Weaver was ""underwhelming"" in this movie at all.  In fact, I thought her performance was subtle and, indeed, mesmerizing.

Other folks have done justice to the plot's description.  But one must watch the movie to get a feel for revenge, or at least some answers, that Weaver's character is seeking after years of torture inflicted upon her (especially after seeing her so nervous and jumpy in the beginning of the film).

What I like most about the film, and it's a trademark of Polanski's that draw me to his films, is the ambiguous ending.  The ""good"" doctor wasn't killed, good didn't win out over evil, and the end wasn't tidied up, Hollywood-style, just to make the public feel good.  It's not the way life works out.

""Death and the Maiden"" is definitely one of the most underrated movies of all time and it's worth the time watching.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1169596800,3,884,4.658064516129032

Her husband was taken home by this man when his car got a flat. She recognized his voice and when he returned later in the evening she ties him up hoping to get a confession out of him.

This is an incredibly suspenseful story. I was intending to put it on pause to get something to eat but I got too involved in the movie. There is only three people in this film and two scene places, the house and their property. But despite the minimalism it's a riveting plot.

659309,5,6303465846,"Roman Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden,"" has a main a plot point that would cause most films to fail. A character is confronted with something; They claim they're innocent and the rest of the movie deals with deciding whether they are or they aren't. Usually, if they are guilty...It's not a big surprise. If they're innocent, there was no point in the movie at all. Despite this, this movie works perfectly...With much credit due to the three actors who carrey the movie. Sigourney Weaver ('Galaxy Quest'), Ben Kingsley ('Sexy Beast'), and Stuart Wilson are the actors who are onscreen for 99% of the movie and this movie is powerful and entertaining. Weaver plays Paulina Escobar, a woman who's somewhere in South America in a small shack waiting for her husband to return. On the radio she hears that her husband has just been elected to a committee run by the president of South America. She apparently disapproves. Her husband soon gets home, but minus his car; He had a blowout miles away and a man has given him a ride. After the husband Geraldo (Wilson) and Paulina chat for a bit, she goes to bed. Then the man that gave Geraldo the ride suddenly reappears. The man introduces himself as Dr. Roberto Miranda (Kingsley) and proclaims himself a big fan of Geraldo's. As the two men have a drink and talk in the living room, we see Paulina in the bedroom getting agitated. Eventually, she sneaks out of the house and steals Dr. Miranda's car. Not worrying about it, Geraldo and Dr. Miranda both go to sleep; But Paulina soon returns and ties Miranda to a chair. 15 years ago Paulina was raped, kidnapped, and tortured by a man that she claims is Miranda. She was blindfolded, so all she bases this on is his voice. Her husband doesn't immediately believe her, and really, neither does the audience. It's clear the woman is a bit off. But unlike most movies like this, we actually can't decide if the doctor is guilty or not guilty. I admire the film's ending for not throwing in some heroic cliches. Anyway, Polanski is really good at pacing. Because almost this entire movie is pacing. But, in the end ""Death and the Maiden"" is suspenseful, well-directed, and completely well acted. A fantastic movie.

659310,5,6303465846,"Death And The Maiden is an overlooked masterpiece and it's not hard to understand why.  First is the dark, serious, and intellectually challenging subject matter which prompts viewers to consider important questions that may ultimately have no satisfactory answers at all.  Second is the format itself.  Death And The Maiden was originally a play, and it shows.  Three characters, frozen in an unholy dynamic, confront their various demons in a small, remote house.  Interaction between them is talky and claustrophobic; the lack of distraction is part of the point.  (Viewers who rely on flaming helicopters, silicon-injected bosoms spilling from bikinis, or artificially sweet deus ex machina happy endings, are advised to look elsewhere.)

Third, of course, is the baggage carried by its director, Roman Polanski.  Had Death And The Maiden been made by someone else it would almost certainly have secured at least one Oscar nomination, if not for Ben Kingsley, surely for Sigourney Weaver.  I will not defend Polanski, indeed, it is highly ironic that a film that deals so brilliantly with the idea of torture, specifically rape as a torture technique, would be the product of a man convicted of raping a 13-year old girl.  Those quick to condemn Polanski conveniently forget that he has demons of his own, having endured the slaughter of his wife, Sharon Tate, and unborn child, at the hands of the Manson family.  This provides context only, not an excuse.  It is also quickly forgotten that Polanski's talent puts him in the category with Kubrick; Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, Death And The Maiden, and The Pianist all bear witness to his incredible gifts.

Amazingly enough, the film's plot is incredibly simple.  Either Kingsley's Dr. Miranda is the man who brutally tortured Weaver's Paulina Escobar or he isn't, by the film's end you know.  Arriving at the truth requires stripping away layer after layer of protective veneer, a raw, spellbinding struggle.  Both Weaver and Kingsley are at the top of their game and the chemistry between them is electrifying.  Paulina's husband, played by Stuart Wilson, is the everyman, he is us, we feel his sympathies wavering as he wonders whether his wife is insane or correct.  Weaver is not a sympathetic victim - her Paulina is unhinged, cruel, shrill, and unreasonable.  (Then again, if she's right, wouldn't this be appropriate?)  Kingsley's Dr. Miranda, by contrast, is hardly our picture of a torturer.  He is intelligent, soft-spoken, affable, charming at times, and almost disarmingly reasonable; the scenes where he is drinking with the husband and ""bonding,"" talking about how difficult women can be, are chilling.

The engine driving this film is our desire to know if Dr. Miranda is guilty - but that is not really the point.  The payload here is the moral price of this most savage and brutal of all human power relationships, the toll it takes, and the correct response.  Weaver's performance is so well shaped that we see the damage, we see how brittle she is, and we cheer her rage, a dark part of us would help her pull the trigger.  That's why this is such a great movie, we see that part of ourselves, then we question it.  Would it be just?  Would it even help anything?  What if she's wrong?  What if she's right, but Dr. Miranda is now a reformed man who feels profound shame about what he did?  Does that matter?  Assuming Dr. Miranda is guilty, was he pushed to these hideous extremes by devotion to some higher goal, which justified them in his mind?  Is this ever excusable?  (Would we torture a terrorist to extract information that might save thousands?)

Don't think that this movie is like a philosophy class, it isn't, it offers a kind of hypnotic entertainment that will galvanize you.  As you become absorbed by this haunting, tiny drama, you and your own conceptions of morality will become another character in it.  Death And The Maiden is a film for adults; a real keeper.",1148860800,8,3957,4.924471299093655
659311,5,6303465846,"I have to say, writing this from my POV does not come easy.  And given that it has been some time since the last entry, probably nobody will ever read this.

Much like a being a prisoner in a cell with a tiny window that has no glass.

I watched this in the company of a trained psychiatrist, specializing in Post Traumatic Stress. I have worked in hospitals with rape victim wards.  I have worked with rape victims in the Martial Arts. And I personally knew people who experienced torture in Chile under Pinochet and who were fleeing for their lives even as most Americans knew nothing of the ""disappearances"".  And I have worked with many SA torture victims in writer's workshops.  So I guess I have to say the film certainly did not bore me.

From experience I can say the language and dialogue is spot on.  Anyone who doubts can dip into the Gulag Archapelago, easily obtainable at Amazon.com.  You, like me, probably will not be able to finish reading the entire thing, however.

My companion's viewpoint is that Sigourney has managed to come out ahead of a lot of people put in the situation of the character she portrays.  Yes, she is right. Yes, she is wrong, in another sense.  Yes she is mentally ill, but she is well above the rest in coping behaviors. Her actions are entirely believable for an individual and entirely believable in a general social context.  That phrase will never ever leave me: ""In here, I am in control!  You do what I say!""  That is entirely classic, no matter what country, no matter what language used.

This is an uncomfortable film and not intended for an evening of light entertainment.  There is, from personal observation, this sense of a ""tape"" of memories that keeps getting played over and over and which the victim cannot -- and ultimately will not -- break or erase so as to start all over again.  There is no resolution, really, except just getting on with life.  No justice can bring relief although the illusion of justice doing so remains.

The film is troubling, but very real, in that no answers are given for the individual or for society.  As Kingley's character says, ""If I am innocent, you kill me!  If I am guilty, you kill me!  What difference does it make?!""

About the only thing in the script I would fault (skip this par. if you have not seen the movie)  is the final confession, for -- again by personal experience -- the torturer never really admits any weakness, but insistently presses upon the necessity of his actions as a consequence of superiority.  Yes, I have met the other side as well.  I would hope no one here ever ever meets the kind of people I have met, but you can read Eichmann's testimony from the Nurnberg trials and see what I mean.

In any case, I would note the differences between opinions expressed in this space seem divided largely along lines of experience.  Like many political issues.  Either you have really been there or not.

At this late stage, I would echo my companion's thoughts that the main thing to gather here is that Ms. Weaver portrays a character who still possesses the ability to feel something, as expressed in her love for her husband.  I guess I have to say that this possibility -- given that torture shows no sign of coming to an end and we have many many victims yet still alive among us -- is the light of a distant star, giving some hope to others.  Since the Academy has turned its back on Weaver -- unjustly more than once, as previous commentators have noted -- perhaps the film can be used in a therapeutic venue.

Pinochet, as of this date, is well over 80 years old and in poor health. Only now are they coming to bring those criminals to the courts in Chile, with some sympathetic help from Spain.  But most of them will be dead of old age long before they face any real trial.  Relief must be found elsewhere and other than turning yourself into the monster that made you.

Peace.",1143331200,10,3905,4.495738636363637
659312,5,6303465846,"It's more than a bit ironic to note that Death and the Maiden, arguably the most compassionately told film dealing with the long-term psychological effects of rape since Ida Lupino's Outrage in 1950, is directed by Roman Polanski, himself a confessed rapist.  Is this movie, made almost two decades after his fleeing America to avoid prosecution, meant to be some sort of an attempt at penance?  Regardless of it's intent, the resulting film is clearly Polanski's most personal to date (at least until 2002's The Pianist), and a return to form after a long stretch of sketchy output.

Having helped to shape some of the best female performances of the last half century (Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion and Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby to name a few), Polanski continues to cement his reputation as an actor's director, this time showcasing Sigourney Weaver (who's ever been a stronger screen presence than she is here).  An actor of remarkable versatility, she's finally given a role that's both deserving of her talents and doesn't include aliens.  And unlike her previous career-high (Gorillas in the Mist), she's allowed to fully embody the character without the disadvantage of having a director and a script that condescends to her.

Starring as Paulina Escobar, a former member of a leftist resistance group in an unnamed South American country, the film finds her married to an inept, idealistic lawyer (Stuart Wilson) who has only a vague understanding of the skeletons in her closet.  That is until one night when, waiting for him to return from a meeting with the newly appointed President, he's dropped off by a stranger who's voice sounds eerily familiar.  He explains to her that he'd had a flat tire and man had given him a lift home, so she seems to drop it.  They quarrel briefly, make love, then are interrupted in the middle of the night by a knock at the door.

It's the stranger (Ben Kingsley, playing to or against type, depending on who you believe) come to drop off a new tire, an act of curious generosity given that the two men barely know eachother.  After a few awkward moments, he's invited in for a nightcap and begins asking oddly probing questions.  It turns out that Gerardo (Wilson) is heading the prosecution of those guilty of torture under the previous regime and is anxious for a sympathetic ear.  That's just what Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) offers him, and it's during this Q and A session that Paulina begins to suspect that she may have finally found her tormentor.

What ensues from there is a psychological game of cat and mouse that's as tense as anything Polanski's ever done, as Paulina bounds and gags the doctor while attempting to coax a confession from him, though his guilt or innocence is left unresolved until the bitter end.  It's here that the casting proves so vital.  After all, can the man who played Gandhi really be guilty of such insidious crimes?  I won't give away the ending, but rest assured it's one not soon to be forgotten, and allows Kingsley one of the best scenes of his career.

All three actors have great moments for that matter.  A favorite of mine is when Kingsley, begging to be freed from his bounds after briefly incompasitating Paulina, says to Gerardo, ""You did nothing.  You just stood there.""  And Weaver responds, ""Of course he just stood there.  He's the law.""  It's these small, seemingly insignificant scenes that reveal the film's subtle nuances and make it a must-see.",1127779200,7,3453,4.825127334465195
659313,5,6303465846,"Without going into obscene detail, I only need to impart the following:

One of the best adapted-to-screen plays I have ever seen.

Polanski, as usual knows exactly when to execute with style, and when to leave things alone and not let directorial vanity obstruct the flow of storytelling. He balances this to perfection.

The acting is of course unbelievable from all three leads.

A fantastic story as well as resulting film, and a shame that it somehow went under the radar of the fickle critical community.",1123459200,4,510,4.895348837209302

The actors are acting so well that it feels almost real. What amazes me most is the fact that there are only three persons acting in the movie. With only three persons so much is going on, and story evolves, never letting me bored. This movie is very interesting, but I wouldn't watch it when I am in a gloomy mood. Also I would not show this movie to any child or young person.

This movie is about an intense anger/resentment and forgiveness. I do not know if it is realistic for a woman to be that courageous. The story itself, together with the excellent acting is quite intense, and I would not say it is entertaining, but it is a good movie.

No revenge can satisfy you, then what do you do? This movie is about forgiving unforgivable.",1103673600,3,941,4.275280898876405
659315,5,6303465846,"This 1994 film was adapted from a play by Argentinean playwright Ariel Dorfman and was directed by Roman Polanski.  Set in an unnamed South American country, three people are thrown together in an isolated house on a dark and stormy night.  The woman, played by Sigourney Weaver is clearly troubled and sad.  Her husband, played by Stuart Wilson, is late for dinner.  Turns out he had a flat tire and a stranger helped him out.  That stranger, who is a doctor, played by Ben Kingsley, soon befriends the husband.  The woman thinks the stranger is the man who tortured her while she was a political prisoner many years before.

There is a new kinder and gentler government now, which is investigating atrocities from the past.  The woman's husband is in charge of the investigation, which is basically focused on identifying bodies and is giving amnesty to many of the worst criminals.  Naturally this complicates the situation.

What follows is not a simple story though because, throughout, questions are raised that have no easy answers.  Is the doctor really the torturer or an innocent man?  After all, it all happened at least ten or more years in the past and the woman has never actually seen her torturer's face as she had been blindfolded the whole time.  The doctor declares his innocence.  At times, he's even charming.  But she has tied him up and is determined to get a confession out of him.

There are many interwoven themes.  The basic one is wondering if the doctor is, indeed, the right man.  But then there is the relationship between the husband and the wife.  We discover he and his wife were both members of the revolution but only she was caught and tortured.  He has been trying to make that up to her for their whole marriage.  We also get to hear a lot about the details of the torture.  It is chilling and disturbing and, even though the only violence in the film is against the suspect who is tied up, the woman's prison experience, which is only talked about and not shown, is excruciatingly painful to hear about.

There are other questions raised too.  What happens to a society when it gives someone power over a helpless person?  Now, we see the woman with power over the tied-up doctor. And we are forced to think about how this kind of power corrupts a whole society.  This is a concept that is universal, as fresh today as it has always been.  And the director certainly knows how to bring it out. All of the actors were sensational.  I soon forgot they were performing and was completely swept into the story.  I could feel the pain of all three characters as well as the horror of the electric shocks of the past.

The title comes from a string quartet by Franz Schubert called Death and the Maiden.  This piece of music had been played during the woman's torture. She has found a tape of it in the doctor's car and plays it throughout.  It helps to frame the action, right down to the film's excellent and satisfying conclusion.

I was surprised to discover that this film had won no significant awards and got little recognition when it was released.  It wasn't even given a high rating from the critics.  That's too bad.  I think that it is an important film.  I'm glad I discovered it though.  It's sad and serious and ultimately meaningful on many levels.  And I give it my very highest recommendation.",1097625600,39,3345,4.586148648648648

First at all , the emotive nervous is powerful and only a talented director and an admirabble cast could take this material and become in an unforgettable film .
Sigorney Weaver has made the best and finest acting of his career with this haunting story .

Since her husband Gerard (Sam wilkinson) is hired to investigate a lot of political issues , he will meet to Miranda (Ben Kingsley), and for those curious coincidences she is really surprised due that voice sounds her familiar .

This initial suspect will turn in the awful true that will reveal the crudeness , the insanity and the excess of a merciless and absence of any scruple in the Government represive forces .

Watch the film coda in which we will see the couple in a Hall Concert listening the death and the maiden this glorious quartet of Franz Schubert . That cross of sights  seem to vanish , ignore and rejoin themselves in a final which states clearly several issues.

First there is in the air the attempt to sacrifice in the name of a future free of revenge , the right spirit of justice and prevailing of the truth .

But there is the sense of blame of Gerard concerned with the fact of avoiding to cross the line and not going to the last consequences of the investigation , in contrats with her who to her own way established her own behavior and punishment code out off record .

659401,3,6303465846,"I would not recommend this for most people.  It is painful to watch and artificial, very stagy (not surprising since it was adapted from a stage play written by Ariel Dorfman), and ultimately not redemptive (as the video jacket claims), but perverse and depressing.
Sigourney Weaver gives a raw-edged performance almost entirely in one key.  She plays a woman (Pauline Escobar) who was raped and tortured by a Nazi-like doctor named Roberto Miranda played by Ben Kingsley in some unidentified South American country.  Since Dorfman is from Argentina, we'll assume it's Argentina.  Certainly this sort of thing happened there during the time of the ""Disappeared.""  The other member of the three-person cast is her husband (Gerardo Escobar) played by Stuart Wilson.  Roman Polanski directed.
The title comes from Franz Schubert's string quartet of the same name which was played by the doctor as he tortured Pauline.
This is a polarizing film.  Women who have ever suffered anything at the hands of men will identify with Weaver's character and may find the film brilliant.  Most men will not even be able to watch it.
There is some ambiguity in the ending, as to whether Roberto really was guilty as charged.  My opinion is that he was without doubt.  The final scene (which I can't describe since it would give away too much) is really a statement about the nature of horror and how it can live on amidst the most familiar settings, a man patting his son on the head, some people attending a concert.
I thought Wilson gave the most balanced performance.  He had the most difficult role since it required subtlety and that he walk a fine line between accepting something monstrous in his presence or disbelieving his wife.  He also had to be a weak sister, as it were, to the dominating presence of Sigourney Weaver who played most of the film with a gun in her hand.  Yet he had to provide the strength of character and to symbolize the sense of justice.  Kingsley looked very much the part of a sneaky little man, and his usual caged intensity was much in evidence.
Bottom line: any film that exposes the atrocities committed by the right wing dictatorships that dominated South and Central American during the Cold War is on the side of the angels; however most viewers I think will find this too intense and disturbing.

Stuart Wilson is a rare ""good guy"" attorney/politician who doesn't understand that there are many shades to truth and justice.  Ben Kingsley is a doctor who thinks that educated people can't possibly be evil, until he is tempted do be so.  Paulina Lorca is a ""supportive"" politician's wife.  She has met her future husband when they work for an underground South American liberation group.  Gerardo is impressed with her resilence and determination.  But, when she is kidnapped by the militia, his psychological and emotional stamina is tested beyond his endurance.  After only two months, he comes to believe that she is dead.  When she escapes and returns to him, he is already involved with another woman.  They reunite anyway, but both her experiences in captivity and his ""infidelity"" taint their marriage.  Little things remind her of the assaults she experienced.  Years later, Gerardo is offered the politically charged post of chairman of the justice commission overseeing the tracking and trying the war crimes of this militia.  She doesn't understand the compromises in politics and he doesn't understand the violence of her experience.  All of this is brought to a head one very rainy night when Gerardo's car has a flat and he is aided by a native of the country.  The native is the doctor who years earlier gave her medical care during her captivity.  His kindness isn't nearly as caring as he would like it remembered.  Gerardo invites his rescuer in for a drink on such a horrible night.  From the bedroom, Paulina recognizes the guest's voice.  When she runs away from home using the good doctor's car, Gerardo is embarrassed and offers their couch as a bed.  He retires for the night.  She returns and checks the doctor out up close.  When she remembers his body smell, things get really tense.  After tying the doctor up, she has a little conversation with him and this causes Gerardo to wake and investigate.  After that, it is a three way battle to win trust and expose reality.  In the end, no one is arrested, but justice is served.  Only three people with the backgrounds that these actors have could carry off this type of project.  There isn't any supporting cast to take the pressure off of them.  Very few people know of Stuart Wilson because he doesn't do publicity.  But, he is such a gem.  Ben Kingsley isn't at all like his godly Ghandi.

 They fight about the comission. Paulina thinks it's whitewash, and 'dignifying a betrayal"" ""What'll happen to the men they can prove were on the death squads?"" she askes ""the evidence will be turned over to the courts"" says Gerardo, Paulina scoffs ""Maybe over the judge who told Maria Bautista, no her husband wasn't tortured, he just ran off with a younger woman.""  It'll only involve cases that ended in death for the victim, Gerardo says he has get the president to change the rules, but to Gerardo it's a job worth doing.

Someone knocks on the door, it's the doctor again, Gerardo has forgotten to take his tire, he also wanted to tell Gerardo what an honor it is to meet him.

This movie is almost like an emotional play, we have one scene, an isolated house on the cliffs of the seashore, and three characters. Period.... It's probably for that reason that you won't see this film cut on DVD because I don't think it was a project for the masses but probably a project of the director, Polanski, and the actors to show their fabulous range of acting skill. In the case of Sigourney she shows us a lot more than we got in her Alien movies since she does appear totally nude ina bedroom scene from the wait up. Even that scene was critical for us to note the cigar burn scars on her left breast......
Ben Kingsley's acting as the wicked DR is absolutely superb (I mean do you expect any less of him) and, although he never managed to convince me of his possible innocence, his acting made everything seem so much like real life ....

Gerardo (Stuart Wilson), her husband, has been appointed to head a commission that will investigate the atrocities of the previous regime, but they are looking at only those cases that resulted in death.  Being raped and tortured is not enough to receive justice.  But then one day, Fate intervenes.  Gerardo is given a ride home by a stranger, Robert Miranda (Ben Kingsley), a local doctor.  Suddenly, in her own home, Paullina, who had been blindfolded during her torture, recognizes the voice of her main torturer.  Instantly, Paulina knows it is time for payback.  She ties up Miranda, stuffs her panties in his mouth, and begins a long attempt to make him confess.
""Death and the Maiden"" tries to play up the ambiguities of Miranda's character.  After all, perhaps Paulina is mistaken.  But Robert Polanski is directing this film, adapted from Ariel Dorman's stage play, and the director's voyeuristic instincts are not going to work in a story that leaves room for doubt.  As an audience we are caught up not only in what Paulina is doing to strip away Miranda's mask, but in the revelations of what happened to her in the past.  But what is past is prologue, and it is the way Paulina strips away the layers from her tormenter, turning the lies into denials before finally giving way to the truth, that makes this film more than a sadomasochistic story.  This is because however stagy and contrived the script might be, the performances by Weaver and Kinglsey elevate the story.  When you finish watching this film you wonder what besides some stupid concert for political correctness kept these two from being nominated for Oscars.  Quite simply, Weaver and Kinglsey have never been better.  At the end, the reason why an ordinary man turned into such an evil fiend will chill you.  This is much more than a simple exercise in revenge.  Be warned: watching this film will drain you.",984009600,11,2013,4.853372434017595
659407,5,6303465846,"This film is an utter masterpiece! Let's start with the plot- written by, and adapted from his own play by, Ariel Dorfman, the screenplay is wrought with twists and guilt and fear in almost every breath. Some find it a bit ""stagy"" but i couldn't see any of it! The direction- is wonderfully full of suspence, yet can be quite tender at times. Polanski knows his subject, knows what he's doing. The music- yes- the music! Written by Wojciech Kilar, who scored ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the music is very simple, yet extremely effective, and often moving. And finally- the acting- Stuart Wilson is very believable as Gerardo, and pulls off the feelings of guilt and anger very well. Ben Kingsley is startlingly acute in his performance as Miranda. He never allows any bias to enter his performance, so you are left guessing to the very end. And, of course, Sigourney Weaver. Who is simply AMAZING!! I knew she was a great actress, but she surpassed herself in this. The torture she goes through; the brief feelings of doubt, and then the dawning that this IS the man she wants. At least that's what she believes. This performance is so powerfull, so tender, so angry and so painfull, that if this were a bigger, studio film, Weaver would have finally walked off with an acadamy award. But, alas, the big studios cannot bring themselves to make movies that have so many strengths and so much to say. See this film. Learn and be amazed at the human beings it portrays. Do you recognise yourself in one of the characters?",971654400,20,1515,4.656716417910448
659408,5,6303465846,"why the heck is sigourney so underrated,after seeing this  the woman deserves more awards than ever.this film is a treat i confess i rented it purely because sigourney was in  it(but isn't that what movie stars are for to sell a movie)but what a surprise,gripping enthralling,disturbing?what a range of emotions one feels when watching this film.superbly played(weaver denied an oscar once again)superbly directed and a genuine effect on the viewer,well it made me think anyway,why more people don't know this film is beyond me,excellent 5 out of 5 see it and be impressed,disturbed,moved,and wonder why sigourney weaver one of americas consistently excellent astresses is looked over for awards,ponder on that!",970185600,5,711,5.454545454545454
659409,4,6303465846,"The story of a torture victim of no small amount of character who believes she recognises her torturer and sets out to confront him. To add to the depth of the plot her husband is a lawyer working for the government and  appointee to a commission to investigate the allegations of torture being  voiced by people like his wife. Sigourney Weaver plays the troubled woman  coming to terms with trauma while her husband and her captor face the  truth.  Taking place over a single evening at a remote country house this  film steps around the prevarications and bureaucracy of officialdom.  Adapted from a play and set in unspecified country, the victims view of  justice is thoroughly explored. Torture is not an easy subject to tell  about and the story makes clear what crimes were committed so it contains  strong descriptions. This film gives a deep meaning to closure.",959731200,12,870,4.8175675675675675
