The 3 hour version includes some scenes not found in the original theatrical release and they do add to the story.

604837,5,6303212263,"The original ""special edition"" (from 2000, upgraded here on Blu-ray) is a masterpiece and one of my favorite films. You'll be getting the exact same special features from the 2000 DVD, with the film in HD and the extras in standard definition. The special features are informative and provide interviews with key creatives, but the audio commentary is the real standout.

But what you want to get this particular Blu-ray release for is the extended cut that had aired on TV in the 1980s. As someone who's seen the special edition 5-10 times, it was pretty surreal seeing this extended cut with roughly 40 minutes of footage I'd never seen. When I go to rewatch Superman: The Movie in the future, I'll choose the 2000 special edition, but I'm still glad I picked this up. Recommended for hardcore fans of the movie but not for casual viewers.",1521936000,,841,4.72108843537415
604838,5,6303212263,"The 3 hour version is the best it really added a bunch to the end of the film, lots more scenes during the final earthquake scene and the scene where Lex is trying to feed his ""babies"" Ms Tessmacher.  Most scenes didn't really add much to the film and I see why they were cut but for a super fan this film is a must have.  I love it when old films receive workprint or lost extended cuts makes them new all over again.  Until today I have never seen this 3 hour television version.",1521849600,,481,4.042105263157895

604840,5,6303212263,"I enjoyed the 3 hour extended cut most. I had not seen it in several decades since it had been last shown over 2 nights on broadcast network television. I also enjoyed the fact that I can now see it in it's original,intended,uncropped,full widescreen version for the very first time ever,plus no commercials,and it was more complete since nothing had to be taken out for commercial time. The crip,sharp,detailed,clarity of Blu-Ray is also a big plus. I also liked the 151 minute version with it's bonus features that is included on a second Blu-Ray disc,in a 2-disc set. I would recommend this release.",1521244800,,602,4.854368932038835
604874,5,6303212263,Ahhh Christopher Reeves as superman.  I especially love this movie because it starts when superman is only a tiny baby and goes from there.  Puts a very humanistic side to the man of steel.  Great superhero movie,1521158400,,212,4.675675675675675

604882,5,6303212263,"Finally! This is like a genie granting a wish. In 1982, an extended 3 hour version of Superman the Movie(1978) debuted on the ABC TV network.
My friend and I owned the 144 minute VHS/NTSC versions of the film. The longer 3 hour cut of Superman the Movie shows more footage of Krypton, there's John Williams music cues that have been restored, a nuclear missile flies around Superman, there's padding of Otis walking around Metropolis, we can see Lois and Clark get into a taxi, there's a cool shot of Superman flying around the World Trade Center after saving Lois, there's Irwin Allen-esque footage of crumbling buildings and people screaming in peril, there's more footage of Jeff East playing a young Clark Kent and more. This Blu Ray set also comes with the 2000 special edition of the film plus extra features. This cut is Superman the Movie IS over three hours long. You'll have to sit still for hours to enjoy it. It's a must see if you are a Superman fan or a fan of cinema.",1517788800,2,982,4.522471910112359
604883,5,6303212263,"""Superman - The Movie"" will forever hold a special plyce in my heart. With regard to visual quality, it's a beautifully photographed movie - especially the scenes set in Kansas are beautiful to look at, I find. Then, of course, the movie boasts a glorious sore by John Williams - to me, a ""Superman"" film without Williams' memorable fanfare just doesn't seem complete. Last, but of course not least, there is that charmin, playful attitude - the film never takes itself too seriously and stays true to its comic book roots. Highly recommended - exciting, humorous, endearing; a feel good film among the super hero movies.",1517788800,,621,4.867924528301887
604956,4,6303212263,An original cut of the 1st movie is a must see for any superman fan of Christopher Reeve!!

604961,5,6303212263,"I remember watching the two night event on ABC in the early 80s. Even when the Special Edition was released on DVD years ago, I knew there were things missing!  Watching this, I saw scenes that I did not remember since I wasn't yet 10 years old back when it originally aired.  When I watched the Blu-Ray for the first it was like being transported back to those two nights.",1516838400,4,373,4.314285714285714
604962,2,6303212263,"I bought this for the scenes that were included in the televised version so many years ago. Many of those added scenes can also be found in Richard Donner's Director's Special Edition, for example, the scene of Superman approaching Lex Luthor's lair and being subjected to bullets, fire and ice in order to kill him. (In a way, i can see why this scene, in particular, makes sense, as it may be all part of Lex's playing ""cat and mouse"" with him leading up to the reveal of the chunk of kryptonite which Supes obviously was not expecting whereas the other attempts were.) As for other scenes that were added for the televised version, I can see why they were cut and they should have remained on the cutting room floor. The movie now clocks in at slightly over 3 hours now and the extra scenes add nothing except length and impatience on the viewer's part. Not worth owning this, in my opinion. Hope someone will want it on eBay.",1515801600,,929,4.470588235294118

604964,5,6303212263,"I have to say, it was amazing watching the Extend TV version for the first time since I was a very young boy! Being a huge fan of this movie, I watched the original version at least twice a year for the past several years. The extended TV version allowed me to view it with fresh eyes and experience things I had not experienced since my childhood. There were things that I remembered, but there were a number of scenes and extensions to scenes that I had completely forgotten about.

Things to note about this version of the movie on Blu-Ray:
1. The Extended TV version is NOT in 5.1 surround sound audio. It is in Stereo only! HOWEVER, the Special Edition version that is included with this collection DOES come with 5.1 surround sound audio.

2. Though the Blu-Ray format is 1080HD, there are scenes that are clearly a lower resolution than others. You will notice a bit of grain with the lower resolution clips if you are watching it on an HD TV. This is a result of an Upconvert from lower res footage. It's equivalent to blowing up and image much larger than it's original size. Being in the business, I know that this is something that has been done a number of times with older movies. In some cases the conversion is not too noticeable, but in others it is, especially with older movies.

3. The thing to remember about this version is, it was intentionally made longer for the purpose of making it a THREE DAY television broadcast.  For this reason, there are some scenes that will seem a bit drawn out and far longer than needed.

4. This movie is for diehard Superman fans that love collecting Superman memorabilia. If you are NOT a super-fan of the original Superman movie, this may not be for you. This version is not meant to improve upon the original movie, though there are some scenes that do enhance the film. This film is meant to allow viewers to simply experience the much anticipated, 3 Day television ""Superman the Movie"" event that many of us got to enjoy many years ago!",1515283200,22,1996,4.487603305785124
604965,5,6303212263,"This is without a doubt the best cut I've ever seen of Superman The Movie. From now on the extended cut is the only one I will be watching.

605077,5,6303212263,I've been waiting for this KCOP extended cut since 1993 and this is absolute gold. Picture and sound are excellent. To whomever got the ball rolling and got this version released: you have my personal thanks.,1514160000,,208,4.805555555555555

605079,5,6303212263,"FINALLY! We get the Editions on HD Blu that are meant for it and it comes out nicely done! I have been a Superman fan for quite a long time and remember this film with great fondness. I especially remember Valerie Perrine and the figure! Wow! She is a stunner here!
The Special Edition is quite nice to have here and with it, all the Special Features and great sound. I would say the picture quality is far better than that of the original Bluray that came out years ago. I recently watched this on the 55"" UHD 4K TV and it looks fabulous.

We also get on the 2nd Blu-ray disc the long anticipated 3 Hour long TV version. That has never been released before until now on Blu-ray.
For 1978, it looks pretty good. I recall seeing this back then and I have good memories of it, still.
Thank you Warner for FINALLY putting this out on HD Blu!

There are quite a few Special Features on this as well. Nicely done!",1513468800,5,908,4.212643678160919
605080,5,6303212263,I was unsure if this was really worth buying so I decided to take a chance on it. I'm so glad I did. I've watched Superman the Movie so many times in my life that I know every scene and spoken word by heart. It was so cool to have scenes that I thought were about end just keep going. New scenes pop up. So much stuff I had never seen before. If you love Superman the Movie just buy this. You won't regret it. I don't.,1513468800,3,418,3.8160919540229883

I wouldn't call it the definitive version, but luckily THAT version..the Richard Donner Director's Cut, is on the other disc on this set. Still, it's a lot of fun to see this material again after all these years and see what other subplots were going on at the same time!",1513296000,,396,4.753623188405797
605083,5,6303212263,"Perhaps the best Superhero movie ever made, now the Richard Donner cut puts the cherry on top with both outstanding video and audio! Listen for the 'whoosh' as the 'S' appears at the beginning, and you know you're in for a treat! Especially if you've seen Donner's cut of Superman 2.",1513209600,2,283,4.568627450980392
605084,5,6303212263,"This  is  one  movie  that's  worth  seeing  over  &  over  again.
I  guess  I'll  never  really  know  what  caused  his  home  planet  Krypton  to  explode.  Perhaps  it  could  no  longer  withstand  its  own  atmosphere  &  built  pressure  over  time  &  just  blew  up.
Superman  is  sent  as  a  baby  to  earth  where  he  grows  up  where  he  discovers  his  purpose.  I  think I  liked  Louis Lane  (Margot Kidder)  better  in  the  second  movie  then  I  did  the  first  movie.  Here  she  screams  an  awful  lot  which  can  be  pretty  silly.  I  found  myself  laughing  quite  often.  She  was  a  good  actor.  &  after  a  while  you  get  to  the  bad  guy  in  the  movie  Lex Luthor  (Gene Hackman)  Who  decides  buy  up  a  whole  bunch  of  land  in  Arizona,  to  Create  a  massive  earthquake  for  a  beach.  Louis Lane  flies  with  Superman  &  learns  she  doesn't  have  to  as  afraid  as  she  is,  &  gains  trust  in  Superman.  Despite  his  parents  cautioning  (It  is  forbidden  for  you  to  interfere  with  human  history)  Superman  doesn't  accept  the  fact  that  he  didn't  get  there  in  time  to  rescue  Louis Lane  during  the  earthquake,  he  might  have  removed  her  car  from  the  quake  after  the  cab  filled  up  with  rocks,  but  she  was  dead,  because  she  didn't  get  enough  oxygen  once  the  car  fell  into  the  crack,&  Superman  disobey's  his  fathers  warnings,  &  makes  the  earthquake  look  as  though  it  didn't  happen  to  save  Louis.
I  like  this  first  movie  because  it  tells  How  Superman  discovers  his  powers,  learns  how  to  use  them,  &  even  though  he  chooses  to  hide  his  identity  he  cannot  really  hide  who  he  is  if  a  car  crashes  into  him  while  he's  crossing  the  street  near  the  office.
&  we  catch  a  glimpse  of  the  3  villains  who  have  the  same  powers  as  Superman,  which  appear  in  the  second  movie.
I  love  the  footage.
The  final  Superman  movie  without  (Christopher Reeve)  I  don't  think  I'd  consider  watching  that  one.  Just  these  4.",1513036800,,2113,4.374251497005988
605085,4,6303212263,"I haven't done a movie review on Amazon or anywhere for that matter in probably over 5 or 10 years. With all the hate that original director Richard Donner has given this TV extended edition (and some fans have as well), I felt that I had to do a review to give this release some justice even though it is just my opinion.

If I was to speak like Clark Kent I would probably say the Superman TV edition was pretty darn swell . I was all in anyway as I already had the 8 disc blu-ray set of previous films and versions. So I had to have this 2 disc set. I already had flops Superman 3, 4 and Superman Returns, so if the TV version was terrible as Donner said then I would at least have a good laugh.

To my surprise, I really liked this edition. Will it be my go to of the now handful of editions for this great film? I'm not sure, but I enjoyed almost all the included scenes. Sure some went a little long and I will say that if I dropped one new scene, it would be the ""skirmish in the van"" between 2 characters as not to totally give it away.

Some questions are answered in this edition and some scenes were just cool to see longer and fleshed some things out that may not have been needed but were still great to have. (More Jor-El with Superman and the extended earthquake scene to name a few) I have loved this film as a kid and as an adult and each edition has its own greatness and flaws, but all are worth it.

So if you are wondering if this edition is for you then I say get it if you are a fan of the original and of course, as a Superman fan in general. Even if you don't like it, you still get the Special Edition which director Richard Donner endorses. It's really a no brainer if you have the $15-$20.",1512950400,4,1717,3.997084548104956

605138,4,6303212263,"The famous ( or infamous) ABC broadcast of the 3hr cut of Superman: the Movie. Padded with a lot of stuff that was edited out, and it's up to the viewer to decided if the extra material is worth sitting through or not. Some of it adds nuance to the overall story, some of it increases the campy factor considerably, and some of it is downright stupid/cheezy.  You decide.
Blu-ray is good, and there's some colour correction that the original theatrical ( and some broadcast prints) sorely needed.",1512864000,4,496,4.636363636363637

There is though about 20 more minutes that belong in the feature and it's there now and greatly improves the film. There is about 10 minutes that could be left out (the destruction of Krypton is a little too lengthily, and Lex Luthor's pets were too just too comic bookish for a serious film), but the rest is footage that should never have been cut out in my humble opinion.",1512691200,2,631,4.401709401709402

I don't believe the studio did an adequate job cleaning it up. Maybe I'm spoiled by high def, but I'd swear the theatrical blu ray edition I have is less grainy. What probably happened is they came across these variations by chance and decided to make a quick buck. The Donner special edition was moderately better in terms of graininess, but I like tv version better. I liked the extended and deleted scenes added in.

Have been waiting to see this footage for many years.  Having said that, it is a bit too much.  I could barely tolerate watching it and fast forwarded through many scenes.  This movie, in my opinion has not withstood the test of time.  Chris Reeves is still great but Margot Kidder is just hideous.  The new scenes are good only for educational purposes but don't make the movie any more enjoyable.  The whole turning the Earth backwards was always a pretty cheap trick pulled by Donner.

605261,5,6303212263,"Firstly this review is for the SUPERMAN THE MOVE EXTENDED CUT BLU RAY (TV Version 188mins)/Expanded Discs, because for some reason Amazon reviews are jumbled up with other Superman The Move previous releases.

As a child I originally saw SUPERMAN in 1978 in the Theatre/Cinema and was completely blown away from start to finish! and easily became one of my favourite films of all time along side the original 1977 Star Wars film. Wasn't it brilliant back then in the 1970s of people of a certain age, boy just fantastic! Special Effects may be dated in places, but are more organic and solid, than the over the top CGI of today's age.

I won't go into the storyline, but theatrical version is well paced, with drama, action and adventure through Space to Farm to City. Christopher Reeve performance as the Man of Steel/Clark Kent is the definitive in my eyes. All the nolstalgic Actors/Actresses all excell.

I remember collecting the full set of Superman Trading Cards and always wonder why certain pictures did not featured in the Cinema version. It wasn't until the early 1980s I read a review in Leonard Martins Film Guide Book that he mentions there was a two night TV Version with around 40mins of deleted footage added to the then 1982 ABC TV Network in the US that featured those pictures in the Trading cards.(Back then there was no Internet! you found info in books and widely published magazines like Starburst) As far as I know the Extended Cut was shown only in the US in the early 1980s, and a even longer cut to 188mins in 1994 and subsequently in Australia and Ireland.

Fans out there who recorded various versions on VHS or obtained 16mm film did put together an available 188mins cut for sale or download free over the years. I managed to obtain this years ago on DVD/ VHS quality. I thought the extended cut was absolutely brilliant with the expanded scenes and deleted cuts especially when Superman flies at different angles and wonder why they were cut from the theatrical version. I can understand for time constraints and pacing that alot of scenes were not used in the cinema version and suitable for TV as to why the original Producers made the TV Versions for Viewing/Financial reasons, but I'm glad they did made these versions or we would have never seen or heard about them (General public/Fans) over the decades, until maybe the DVD/Blu ray AGE as extras!!!

Historically The original film source TV Version Cut seemed lost forever and patching up to match them from scratch I imagined would have required locating original film negatives and restoration as Richard Donnor did in his Expanded 2000 release. But out of the blue as I recently read prior to this Blu Ray release, the WIDESCREEN! full length TV VERSION was found in some Warner Archive Vault. And now we can fully enjoy the actual Extended Cut in HD Blu ray! albeit restored sound/visuals where necessary. I understand unknown to a majority of people/fans but probally die-hard fans of Superman a certain TAKE involving Lex and Ottis clammering around when the ambulance van doors are flung open seems shorter which was actually the edit used in the 1982 TV ABC version and a longer one in an international TV Broadcast. A downloaded version made by a fan called Restored International Cut included the longer one with Lex and Ottis as opposed to the original TV Broadcast in 1982 which also didn't include Christopher Reeve/Marlon Brando scene in the fortress of Solitude after Superfeats. I guess Pan & Scan and edit cut downs were used to form from the 188mins Widescreen recentley discovered were used in the original 1982 TV Network broadcast.  Interesting stuff, though I personally think this Blu ray release is as good as it gets.

For most of us the TV Extended cut is virtually new and discovered or even unheard of until now it's availability on Blu Ray Disc.
From my own experience I thought I saw everyithing having been used to the Pan & Scan TV Average quality, but was blown away like being a child again by this fantastic WIDESCREEN VERSION with scenes I obviously haven't seen in my life. Overall brilliant. 3 hours or so flew by.
The picture quality is unique to it's own compared to the theatrical/expanded release in a positive way. I'm glad they kept the original sound, with enhanced spacial mono where dialogue music cues/special effects are clear and in my oppinon done well. The opening/end credits include true stereo that blends in well into the film.

My only quarm I have with this release is that like so many of the Superman DVD/Blu ray cover design they are too generic. They should have used the original UK 1978 UK art poster! buy hey! i'm probally being picky!

Note: Though this is a WARNER ARCHIVES release only available ON DEMAND via Online/Sellers and not in shops, this is a geniune Blu ray manufactured DISC like any other commercial/chart busting film release quality disc and not a B D- R. It is also Region Free and should play on worldwide players.

Thankyou to you guys at Warner Bros/Archives for this TV Version on Blu Ray.

So of course I was excited and curious.  And it was good.  Does it need to be 3 hours? I don't think so. Some of the scenes were extended beyond necessary. Warner is wise to include both versions of the movie because for anybody who doesnt have Superman on blu Ray, this is definitely the version you want to buy.  The special effect was good considering when it was made. The new generation will probably think the flying is a joke because it was obvious the scene was superimposed, especially during the day time. But for us who grew up watching it when it was released the first time, it was a magic. Gone now the superheroes movies that are innocence and fun. Every one of them has to be dark and depressing because supposedly the general public don't want them anymore.  I long for superheroes like Christopher Reeves Superman.",1508630400,,971,4.557471264367816
605319,5,6303212263,"Hat's off to Warner Archive for releasing this legendary extended version of Superman the Movie. This version was a true event when it was shown over two nights on ABC in 1983. This was long before the internet or hundreds of cable channels and most people watched what was on the three main networks live. Not only was ABC showing a hugely popular movie, they were showing it with 40 minutes of never before seen footage. This was a mind blowing concept at the time. It was before the era of deleted scenes on DVD and was the first time people were introduced to the concept that scenes were actually cut out of movies.

Low quality VHS copies of that ABC version and subsequent 1980s broadcasts have circulated for years among collectors. When WB video released STM in various forms over the years, fans always requested the TV version. Instead, we got the 2000 Special Edition, which restored several of the scenes, but ultimately only 8 of the 40 minutes. It also had a newly remixed soundtrack that replaced many of the familiar sound effects, which turned off many fans from that version. (to clarify, there are 3 versions of STM available: the 143 minute theatrical version, the 151 minute Expanded/Special Edition and the 188 minute Extended TV version. This blu-ray includes the 151 and 188 minute versions).

Now here we are in 2017 and Warner Archive has found a holy grail widescreen 35mm print of the TV version miraculously preserved in a vault. Cropped 16mm prints of the TV version have been in the hands of collectors for years, but no one even suspected there was a widescreen 35mm version. Warner has meticulously transferred the print and done a lot of cleanup to produce a version that looks a hundred times better than the old 1983 version, plus reveals 40% more picture because it is in widescreen. It is a bit grainy in places, but that is how film prints from that era look. Many classic films are overly scrubbed of grain, which also removes some fine detail.  Considering the age of the print (35+ years) and the fact it was never meant to be seen in high definition, it looks very good and is more detailed than the special edition blu-ray in some places.

The audio is mostly in mono, because that is how TV was broadcast back then. Warner did add stereo music to the main and end titles, which leads me to the only negative aspect of this release. They used the wrong version of the main title theme, so it is jarringly and incorrectly edited. I'm sure this was done with good intentions, but they should have just left it as the original mono directly from the TV version, or lifted it from the soundtrack of the theatrical version. Still, this is a minor complaint and won't be noticed by most viewers. It doesn't detract from what is an overall outstanding release.

Huge kudos to Warner Archive for releasing this and for doing a fantastic job with it. Highly recommended. I hope they release the unique TV version of Superman II next.",1508630400,8,2969,4.626185958254269

605322,5,6303212263,"Norm Jewison in the documentary ""Norm Jewison Filmmaker"" taking a look at him during the filming of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" in the late 60s, stated that he had never seen a producer add or improve on a film.  This film shows that that's not always the case.

To be fair, I think Norm Jewison is largely correct, but from a director's standpoint of ""totalitarian dictator for the life of the film"" I think there's a tendency to treat said project just a little much as their personal kingdom.  Unless they wrote the script we directors really don't have too much in the way of morally asserting what should stay or what should go in a film.  We shot the thing, but we didn't invent the story.

And this is where the three hour cut of this film shines.  Every so often this film does marginally get bogged down in extra footage, but the pacing is about the same as the theatrical release.  It may not be Donner's intended vision (with all due to the extremely talented individual that he is), but the director didn't write the basic tale upon which the film is based.  That would be Joe Siegel and John Schuster, two Jewish New York boys who turned their passion into a dream as young men.  Of course, they got screwed for it later on ... but that's another story.

The added footage helps ties things up and adds more exposition to explain some of the details that some of us were wondering about when the film was initially released.  There's more exposition when Superman makes his debut, there's more footage regarding the land buyout in California, some of the scenes are extended here and there, and so forth.

And I actually like it better than the theatrical release.  I have my issues with the film in and of itself, but I do think that this is an improvement over the original film.

After completing its amazing theatrical run, Superman: The Movie finally got its world television premiere and was aired as a two night special event. Being a kid, Having seen it in theaters in late '78, I was stoked to watch it again. Spread out over that Sunday evening and then that following Monday night, more footage was presented that supposedly Warner Bros left on the editing floor yet I could've sworn those minor scenes were in the original theatrical showing. Well no matter....because after all these decades I'm so happy to now own that long extended tv cut. In 2000, we were graced to receive director Richard Donner's definitive cut of the 143 min film with eight added minutes; this new version is just over three hours long (188 min). There's more detail added, making for a stronger narrative (more to the destruction of Krypton, insight into the life of teenage Clark Kent, his adult life as Superman, Lex Luthor's criminal machinations, etc). This is the most definitive, most fleshed out version we'll ever see. Watching this longer version reminds me of how much fun I had seeing this on tv all those years ago. But no matter what version is shown, Superman still holds up as great timeless entertainment.

Hopefully now we can get the extended cuts to Superman II and III as well.",1507939200,8,1338,4.742489270386266

605426,3,6303212263,"If the rumors on IMDB are to be taken as the truth, the 3-hour cut was made for the sole purpose of the producers trying to get more money from TV networks, and it sure feels like it.  There are some great extended scenes, most notably in the beginning on Krypton and being able to see more of Marlon Brando's Jor-El, but certain scenes like Lana Lang giving silent reactions in the car for an additional few minutes, or young Clark jumping on a few extra pieces of ice in the North Pole, feel completely unnecessary and only work to slow down the film's pacing.  On top of this, certain scenes just seem to linger, making them more awkward than practical.

It's great that this blu-ray exists for historical purposes, and the Special Edition gets it ""just right"" in terms of plot pacing, but after watching the 3-hour version once, there's really not a need to watch it again.

605486,5,6303212263,"George Lucas is a convenient scapegoat for those looking to cast blame upon the current state of ""revisionist cinema.""  But, in reality, he was only giving a media obsessed culture more of what they want.  There is no ""final cut"" of a particular film anymore, only a funhouse mirror of infinitely edited variations, cut together whenever inspiration (or marketing necessity) strikes.  But Lucas is simply a high-profile target for creationist criticism; in fact, the studios have been suffering from ""special edition syndrome"" for nearly 50 years now.

Case in point, the Extended Cut of Richard Donner's Superman (1978) made its television premiere with over 40-minutes of story added to stretch the debut to a two-night event.  Some bits and pieces of this expanded footage has turned up in various incarnations of the film on home video over the years, but we've never had the full 188-minute epic released on hi-def until now. Is it the final say on what many still consider to be the best superhero movie of all time...or too much of a good thing?

As you might imagine, it's a little of both.

Superman was ahead of it's time from the get-go considering Donner actually shot both the original and most of the sequel - featuring General Zod and his evil cronies - back-to-back before being replaced by Richard Lester.  And while Donner's version of Superman II eventually saw the light of day (again, thanks to fan demand), it was a compromised version of what could have been.  The new Extended Cut of the original still feels like Donner's film, just a more loose and organic version that - depending on your point of view - needs a bit of pruning.

It's difficult and tedious to point out exactly what's ""new"" here; there are plenty of fan websites for that.  Suffice to say that those additional 40-minutes are spread out amongst the entirety of the film, resulting in scene extensions and casual character asides you might not even notice.  In fact, a lot of the new footage is almost contextually invisible.  And that's a good thing!  There are very few moments that stick out as obvious add-ons, nothing that changes the mood or a motivations, no Greedo-shoots-first controversy to debate.  But it's also obvious which new scenes are unnecessary; bits needed to be cut short for reasons of narrative content not commercial necessity.  In short, Superman: The Extended Cut is the same film, only longer.  And in an era of rejiggered, reimagined and often completely reinvented restorations, that's particularly satisfying all by itself.

Warner Archive's Blu-ray edition offers up all the new material in seamless high-definition; there's no noticeable change in quality from one scene to the next.  And the 2-film collection in throws in the special edition of Superman: The Movie (previously released on Blu) for comparisons sake.  All of the previous special features for that one are carried over, including Donner's commentary, three documentaries, screen tests, additional scenes and a music only track of John Williams iconic score.",1506816000,49,3050,5.025844930417495

605490,5,6303212263,"SUPERMAN THE MOVIE the Extended TV version is finally officially released and in HD quality
the TV version was broadcasted over 2 night's back in the early 80's about 90 mins each night
but with commercials makes it 2hr time slot each night
well finally Warners have officially released it on blu-ray i can throw my old VHS copy out now
it's paired with richard Donner's 151min cut on Disc 2  that's 145min then the end credits starts
with all the special features taken from the old special edition dvd set
here's my comments on the picture & sound quality
well the TV version was screened in 1:33:1 ratio but to my big surprise warners have widen the ratio to 2:40:1 Theatrical presentation
so both 145min & the Longer 188min is both 2:40:1 ratio
warners have made lots effort with picture quality the TV version looks excellent about 9/10
the sound quality is only 2.0 master stereo mix maybe 6/10 which is better than the old Mono sound of course
it was very emotional watching all the extra scenes inserted back in compared to watching it on Grainy 1:33:1 VHS
most of the extra scenes inserted back into the TV version were first Digitally restored as extras on the old special edition dvd
the Richard Donner cut is 145mins so i believe the many extra scenes are about 30mins more
so at 180min roughly then the end credits start, making the run time 188min
so you have a choice either still watch 145-151min version or just watch the full 180min version
it's matter of personal taste really
5 stars for this new reissue based on a Milestone event of the Longer Extended cut now officially released to buy",1506470400,39,1609,4.586805555555555
605491,5,6303212263,"It's too good to be true!  Super rare TV cut here. For those wondering and as the story goes the Salkind producers put together a lengthier version for TV back in the 80's to pad time and get more money from the network. Don't confuse this with most versions that were aired on TV as this cut contained extra scenes and extensions, I think everything the producers could find really having seen a blurry cut of it myself. It only aired a few times to my knowledge and those scenes have never been restored or released officially in any format. So there was a TV cut which was always shown and this one that is the holy grail. Not saying it contains tons of scenes with Superman but true fans should have fun picking out the little moments added into the Bluray. A real gem we're getting here.",1506470400,23,792,4.351351351351352
605492,5,6303212263,"I have seen the 3 hour Television Cut and the tone is very different.  Now in general there isn't any real new scenes.  What we get is scene extensions.  Most of what is cut from each scene is the comedy element.  This was a wise choice..  I think some thing could have been left in but the film was over 2 hours long when it was released.  In 1978 the average length for a film was  under 2 hours.  The most exciting part of this version is the  extensions of the Krypton scenes. Now out of all the new scenes I would of kept in  1)  There is an added element of a guard going to Jor-El home to arrest him.  To say more would be wrong.  2) During the Chasing Rockets segment there is an added bit that I love where one of the rockets ""just goes around Superman"".  3) Another great moment is where Jimmy Olsen is picked up by ""Superman"" and he  photographs the Hoover Dam falling apart.  I am glad this version is being released.  Fans can finally see it.  It is also nice to see why they were cut to begin with.",1506384000,60,1012,4.050761421319797

605524,5,6303212263,"Otisberg? Otisberg? You gotta love it.  Man this movie was special.  The first real superhero movie of the modern age coming out in 1978.  Richard Donner created a great well rounded story that came off as an exceptional movie.  I enjoy every part of this film whether it is the theatrical release or the Special Edition.  The cast and crew made an amazing film that still holds up very well to todays CGI dominated movies.

I love how the film takes its time to flesh out the characters and their personalities.  1/3rd of the film is just dedicated to Supermans origin story before he becomes an adult living in Metropolis.  Glenn Ford was exceptional as Jonathan Kent and you see the wisdom in the old man trying to tame his cocky but bright young son.  The dialog and screenplay was well done.  When Jonathon tells Clark that You were sent here for a reason, and its not to score touchdowns. You really believe it coming from the old man, great writing.  You really feel sadness when Clark loses his adopted father just a few moments later onscreen.

The music and pacing of this film flowed beautifully together.  The theme itself is one of John Williams best.

The film makes you believe and care about its characters even the villains are fun and interesting personalities.  Who can forget Otiss bumbling music or the gorgeous eye candy Miss Teschmacher.  Gene Hackman nailed the Lex Luther character and it is a signature role for him as well as Popeye Dolye in the French Connection and as sheriff Little Bill in Unforgiven.  I liked the duel rocket scene as well where Superman could only save one side of the country but not both at the same time.

The one scene that was added to the Special Edition I wish they would have had in the theatrical version is when Superman goes down through the sewer to Lex Luthers layer.  He goes through 3 separate trials or tests if you will, set up by Lex Luther.  Superman goes through 3 different rooms with Machine Guns, Fire and Ice before breaking down the wall into Lexs hideout.  This scene is really quick maybe 2 minutes or so but I would have loved seeing these trial scenes in the original theatrical version.  To me it just completes the movie and gives it that extra edge.

The film as a whole holds up remarkably well for its age.  I would put it up against any of the current crop of Superhero movies.  Besides the dated special effects I still think this film has the best origin story out of all of them with just the right mix of action and comedy thrown in.  Seriously the open credits of this film are amazing and the Superman Theme beats out all the other Spiderman, Marvel and Batman films coming out every other week nowadays except for Tim Burtons 1989 Batman film that is also a 5 star movie.

When my kids are old enough I want them to see this type of superhero movie first before seeing any of  the ADD Marvel Avengers movies coming out every other week.  The only effect that really looks dated is the dam bursting scene you can blatantly tell the model work below the dam but can hardly condemn the film for such a minor effect.

I would rate this film 5 stars and recommend it to everyone.  If you have only seen the theatrical version it is worth your time to check out the Special Edition.",1499990400,,3268,4.460370994940978

605526,5,6303212263,"For me...this will always be the definitive Superman movie.  Christopher Reeve, may he rest in peace, is Superman. He'll always be Superman to several generations now and into the future.  And although some of the effects are noticeably dated, one cannot but be awed by the cinematography, especially in the early farm scenes in Smallville.  Beautifully shot with majestic landscapes, you truly have to appreciate something with such scope from a superhero film made in the 1970s.  Although the budget ballooned, you can really see the amount of love and detail put into this movie. It still holds up to the test of time.  Witty banter, excellent chemistry between Christopher, Margot and Gene.  The rockets still look believable and Lois' tragic fate still scares the crap outta me.  I simply have to give this movie a watch every year.  Nothing will ever come close to John Williams original score as well. Richard Donner's name as well as the talented crew behind this movie will always go down as being ahead of their time.  Simply incredible.",1495843200,5,1047,4.937142857142857
605527,4,6303212263,I like this movie. It is fun watching superman getting a class act treatment. All the performers are spot on. The special effects are good. The story is very good. The reasons I gave it 4 out of 5 stars are this: 1. The fortress of solitude stinks. It should be exactly like the comic book version. 2. Marlon Brando. I found out that when he filmed his scenes he read his lines off cue cards while they were on a moving solely. He did not memorize them like the other cast.,1494633600,,473,4.1521739130434785

And there's a charming memory I have regarding the movie I'd like to share.  Back in the late 70's, while walking East on 42nd
Street on my way home after work, there was a huge crowd milling between 2nd and 3rd Ave.  Everybody was looking up and
shouting, and there, on top of the Daily News Building, all brilliantly lit up, was a helicopter perched precariously on the edge of the roof!  It was very frightening!  I never heard another thing about the event.  And then, the next year, the movie, Superman came out,

605880,4,6303212263,"I bought this on Amazon for about $12. You really have to search for it because there are many versions and the prices vary a lot.

Made in 1978, this was the first serious attempt at making a film based on a comic superhero, and it's still one of the best. Making Superman ""fly"" was very difficult to do back then and may not look as good as today's HD films and effects but, on a whole, this is the best Superman film to date, IMO. This film is for the whole family, so it's lighter and has comic elements. The newer films are darker and more serious and take more liberties. Maybe I'm biased, having grown up in that era, but Christopher Reeves makes a great Superman.

This film has been released many times, so which is the best? That depends on what you want. You can get this film packaged with Superman 2, or you can get the whole Reeves films collection. You might still find the original 1978 version on DVD, or you can get the 2000 expanded version on DVD and Blu-ray. You can get lots of special features or very few.

I owned the original DVD of this film, the 1978 version, and I later got the 4-DVD set, with the remastered 1978 version plus the remastered 2000 expanded version by original director Richard Donner plus LOTS of bonus features (documentaries, TV specials, 1951 George Reeves film, remastered 1940's Fleischer Studios cartoons). That one looked better than the original DVD.

Now I own this Blu-ray, and it looks the best so far. However, I should say that there are inconsistencies in the film quality - some parts look grainier (or whiter and hazier, to be more exact) and other parts look cleaner and clearer - but that's just the way the it was originally filmed. As far as I can tell, the Blu-ray sound is also the same as on the remastered DVD, which is good.

This Blu-ray contains the 2000 expanded version by Richard Donner. It also contains a number of special features, including 2 documentaries. The reason I deducted 1 star from my rating is that the ""perfect"" version would be the 4-disc set (that I described above) all remastered and put to Blu-ray. For a single disc, this is great. However, I wish I had the option of watching the 1978 original theatrical release as well as the 2000 expanded version.

Enjoy!

FYI - When director Richard Donner made this film, he shot most of the footage for Superman 2 at the same time. Although Superman 1 was a huge success, the studio fired Donner just before completing the second film and Richard Lester was called in to finish and re-edit it. At the time, Superman 2 was hailed as being a great sequel (and can be found on DVD) but recently the original Donner version was released on DVD and Blu-ray and people are mixed on which version is better. IMO - back when it originally came out, I remember thinking the second film was even better than the first and I later bought the DVD. However, since then I have a hard time watching the second film. For me, it has not aged well, while the first remains a ""classic"".",1453593600,,3006,4.454545454545454

On the plus side, Gene Hackman was very funny and probably the highlight of the movie.  Marlon Brando did a fine job and Christopher Reeve was not too bad.  Had Reeve had a good script, he might have been wonderful.  And the Krypton part of the film was interesting and gave hope it might become a good movie.  But unfortunately, no.

The extra minutes of Krypton's destruction was more emotional and devastating along with the music cue playing that made the scene even sadder. The extra minutes of the Fortress of Solitude made it more epic as we see it completely coming to life piece by piece. The extended earthquake scene should have been there as well. The scene was more suspenseful and devastating seeing all the destruction happening at the same time. The scene I would have left off was Larry Hagman giving mouth to mouth to Valerie Perrine; to me that scene was a bit too campy and cartoonish.  For me that should have been the special edition with the extra minutes of those three particular scenes.,1441670400,,851,4.598684210526316

When you watch this movie today you might be very critical of the special effects and some of the humor but you have to try and keep everything in context.  To be honest, I thought the effects were very good for the time.  One of the original taglines with the movie was ""You'll believe a man can fly.""  And I think they really pulled that off.  Christopher Reeve is the BEST incarnation of Superman on film.  Gene Hackman was also excellent as Lex Luthor.  I never particularly cared for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane though.  I felt she portrayed her as too whiny and not as strong of a female character as I think Lois is.  Maybe it is a reflection of our current cynical culture that our Superman today has to be dark, vulnerable, and brooding.  I think that Superman was always meant to be a strong, honest, and a ray of light type of hero and that's what this movie brings to the table.

606140,4,6303212263,"The first blockbuster superhero movie came out in 1978, almost 40 years ago! It is the origin tale of Superman as told by director Richard Donner from a screen play that includes Mario Puzo (of Godfather fame) among its writers.

The story is interesting in how it delves more into Krypton's last days. Jor-El (Marlon Brando) argues with other Kryptonian elders that the planet has less than a month to live. They don't want to hear it so they silence him. He and his wife send their only son, Kal-El, to Earth. Krypton is destroyed almost immediately after the departure. The boy travels through space, learning a bit of science and history on the way. He crashes on Earth as a toddler and is adopted by Ma and Pa Kent, who raise him to be a good man. Clark Kent grows up hiding his amazing powers. He eventually leaves, heading to the Arctic where he uses a crystal left by his father to build the Fortress of Solitude. He learns more about his powers and history and purpose from recordings made by his Kryptonian father. That's basically the first hour (i.e. first half) of the movie. The pace is pretty slow but the story telling is well-done. Jacob and Lucy watched and never said they were bored (except during the opening credits, which do go on for a while).

The pace picks up when Clark moves to Metropolis. He takes a job as a reporter with the Daily Planet and begins his life as a super-heroic do-gooder by foiling crimes and saving cats from trees. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is planning the crime of the century. Lex can't resist taunting Superman into a rivalry with some predictable if not unenjoyable results.

As I said, the movie's pace is very slow by modern standards but the special effects hold up (mostly) even 40 years later. Christopher Reeve is great as bumbling Clark Kent. As Superman, Reeve is a little flat mostly because Superman's character is a little flat as the heroic do-gooder. The other actors are all good though the script is hammy in some parts. The kids enjoyed it and are interested in seeing the next movie, which will definitely do. Thank goodness for some PG-rated superhero films that I can show them!",1437436800,,2161,4.622395833333333

606179,4,6303212263,"I'll be perfectly honest here: Superman isn't one of my favorite superheroes. I wouldn't even put him in my top five (maybe even top ten). For one, I didn't really grow up with him. I'm also more drawn to damaged characters, and Superman's ""boy scout"" nature just doesn't connect with me in the same way as someone like, say, Batman. The first Superman movie I saw was SUPERMAN RETURNS, way back in 2007, and it was decent enough. I was also able to see MAN OF STEEL in theaters, and while that one hewed closer to the tone I like in a comic book movie, the non-stop barrage of action in the final act was almost too much. Now that I've seen the film that started it all, I can see why people might prefer this incarnation over what's come since. He's an uncomplicated hero in a world filled with moral complexity. I liked SUPERMAN for what it was and what it meant for all that was to follow, but I still feel like some elements date it considerably.

Since the film has been out for almost 40 years, a plot synopsis is probably unnecessary, but I'll do one anyway. It starts on Krypton when Kal-El's parents (Marlon Brando as Jor-El) send him to Earth in order to survive Krypton's impending destruction. When he lands, Jonathan (Glenn Ford) and Martha Kent find him and raise him as their own. He eventually finds out who he is and where he came from and then it moves to the present day where he lives as ""mild-mannered reporter"" Clark Kent and works at Metropolis' big newspaper, The Daily Planet. Being that it is a comic book movie, it has a big bad villain who, in this case, is Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) and Superman (Christopher Reeve) has to foil his nefarious plan.

I'll start with what I liked. All the performances were really good, even though the way some of the characters were written didn't quite sit right with me. Christopher Reeve, even though he doesn't show up until almost an hour in, perfectly embodies both halves of Clark Kent/Superman's identity and he had this boyish charm that I'm sure women strongly responded to when they first saw the film. Marlon Brando, even in his limited screen time, did a good job. Gene Hackman did a fine job as Lex Luthor, although at times he came off as a stereotypical mad villain with harebrained schemes. There were, however, a few moments where he came off as very intimidating and evil, but not in a cartoonish way. I also thought Margot Kidder did good work as Lois Lane, although I still don't get how she can't tell that Clark Kent and Superman are the same person. In general, her character was well-written, although maybe not as a strong a female character as modern audiences are used to. Beyond the performances, I thought the special effects were done, if a little dated. The flying sequences are probably some of the weaker ones, but there were some amazing sets and practical effects especially in the opening sequence on Krypton. However, far and away my favorite aspect of the whole film was John Williams' score. Say what you will about the cheesy writing and hackneyed attempts at comedy, but I got chills every time I heard the main theme. I also really liked the love theme ""Can You Read My Mind."" John Williams is a master composer, and this is for sure one of his best scores (although I did hear a bit of Star Wars in there).

As far as what I thought didn't work, the overall tone of the film was a little bit too ""comic book-y"" at times. In particular, Lex Luthor and his two dimwitted associates came off as overly silly. Luthor himself was broadly written as an obviously evil villain who often refers to himself in such terms, and it made me laugh but not in a good way. In general, the comedic tone wasn't something I particularly cared for anyway. At times I wondered if I was watching a screwball comedy with pratfalls and bad puns. There were also a significant portion of the special effects, particularly composite shots of flying which pale in comparison to what can be accomplished nowadays. Endearing maybe, but not very believable. The sequence where Superman takes Lois flying is a perfect example of this. At one point all she's holding onto is his hand, and it was fairly clear that both of them were held up on harnesses, which took me out of the experience a bit. There's also the issue of the climactic earthquake where Superman dives into the Earth to fix the San Andreas fault line which looked pretty cheesy and fake. Finally, and this is a pretty big spoiler, the part where he flies around the Earth in order to reverse time and bring Lois Lane back to life was just bad. Silliest and stupidest part of the whole movie.

Overall, though, I do respect the film for what it accomplished at the time, and opening the door for future comic book adaptations to get big-budget treatments. As far as I'm aware, this is one of the most faithful representations of a comic book character to date. It succeeds on the level of blockbuster filmmaking, as well as being a suitably entertaining film otherwise. Richard Donner would of course go on to better things (in my opinion), but he showed a lot of talent here. I would also be remiss by forgetting to mention the amazing cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth. There was some legitimately amazing camera-work and beautiful visuals. Those things combined with the good performances and enthralling score by John Williams are what make this such a watchable film. There are a number of things which I don't think hold up, but every comic book fan worth his salt should see this if they haven't already.

EXPANDED EDITION:
This version of SUPERMAN was released in 2001 and contains about 9 minutes of additional scenes. I did find the added material interesting, for the most part, but it doesn't really improve the film as a whole in my opinion. One scene in particular, in which Superman tells his father how much he enjoyed saving people came off as more silly than sincere. For rewatch purposes, I'll probably return to the theatrical cut more than this version.",1434585600,,6017,4.598696461824954

If you look at ancient mythologies, Superman is similar to Hercules and King Arthur. He's basically a demigod enacting heroic deeds. Both can suffer and be destroyed under the right circumstances. Superman is the stuff that dreams are made of...

According to the filmmakers, there was a reluctance on the part of Hollywood to make a movie about the most famous of all American superheros. They feared that it would either be too campy, too sentimental or audiences would be disappointed when it was not the Superman they imagined. And actually, these kinds of problems have plagued many of the superhero movies that have been made in the wake of Superman's unparalleled and unsurpassed success. Somewhere, somehow, the filmmakers found that blurry area where the fantasy of the comic book and the realism of film could meet and somehow produce the story of Superman on the large screen. I think the main reason the film works as well as it does is because of the fine acting and a fine script that takes themselves seriously enough that the audience runs with it and yet maintains its fantastical flair. The entire idea behind Superman is pure American fantasy on the grandest scale, and the filmmakers understood how to capture this idea tremendously well on film.

Of all the elements that made it work, the script is on the forefront. Many subsequent attempts at screen writing a superhero from the pages of a comic book to the luster of the screen have had mixed results, and some of them had been in dire need of rewrites, such as the original Michael Keaton ""Batman"" and the Ben Affleck ""Daredevil"" (which desperately needed Frank Miller), both suffering a script in which the writers didn't seem like they knew what they wanted their project to be. But Superman's script was honed before it was shown. Every line reinforces the premise, the feel and the rhetoric behind the story. This is fantasy but it also has to be believable. Superman's initial encounter with Lois Lane, his response to her inquiring his identity as simply ""A friend,"" sets up Superman's character that permeates the entire film. He is not doing what he does to feed his own ego and/or gain publicity. He is helping for help's sake, and that is the very essence of Superman. If he had flexed his muscles and said ""I am Superman,"" the entire experience would have lapsed into farce of the Adam West Batman variety. Superman' combination of heroism and humility is coupled with a slightly different take on Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. Unlike the campy 1950's series in which the difference between Kent and Superman was like trying distinguish Dracula and Bella Logosi, Reeve offers a Clark Kent that is a fish out of water. Kent is a stumbling and bumbling Midwesterner out of rural Nebraska who knows about as much about urban living as your average hay stack, which becomes a refreshing contrast between his two identities.

Simultaneously, the evil but wickedly witty Lex Luther is probably the most memorable figure outside of Superman's inner circle. The devilish genius is enacting the crime of the century where potentially millions may die, and he does it with a smirk on his face and a knowing grin. Sort of a cross between Albert Einstein and Joseph Stalin. When asked by Superman if he gets his kicks by ""planning the death of innocent people,"" his response is ""No, by causing the death of innocent people."" There are a few in-jokes for those who know the Superman story, for example when, in the first Superman sequence, Clark Kent passes by an open phone booth, looks at it, and then finds an alternative place for the ""transformation"". And of course, Jimmy Olsen's habit of calling Perry White ""chief"" gets a little play at the beginning.

But the script alone can't bring a movie success. You need actors who know how to deliver the lines in just the right timing and tone to convey the essence of the story and the realism of the characters. The major leads, particularly Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, and even Jackie Cooper brought an atmosphere to the script that makes the fantasy seem real. Among the supporting cast, the standout performances have to be Hackman and Cooper. Hackman brings a haughty but underplayed sensibility that makes Luther an intriguing villain. He cuts down his lackeys with the kind of dry wit you might expect of Bing Crosby the 1940's or even Cary Grant in his later films. And Jackie Cooper, who had been in the acting business for nearly a half-century, seemed born to play Perry White, the hot-headed but passionate editor of the Daily Planet. Cooper as White gives his reporters the assignment of interviewing Superman, which will be, in his opinion, ""the single most important interview since... God talked to Moses!""

Despite the other actors who have played Superman, Christopher Reeve is still by far the best. This film and its sequel are two of the greatest superhero films ever made. And what made him great was what Reeve as Superman replied at the beginning to Lois Lane's question ""Who are you?"" ""A friend.""",1432684800,2,5450,4.868534482758621

606246,5,6303212263,"If anyone out there has not seen this great film yet, I'd be surprised.  So, we are talking about seeing it again, or seeing it on Blu-Ray for the 1st time.  Either way, it's worth it and this is one film you will see at least once a year and not put it in perpetual storage like the rest of your library.
This film had been long awaited by fans of the comic book.  It came out in true Hollywood style, where even the film credits were awe-inspiring, let alone the Sfx, the stars( Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford) and of course the story.
As we all remember, the story has the people of the planet Krypton facing doom.  Marlon Brando is Superman(Reeve)'s father and tries to rally the people to act before the planet is destroyed.  Noone has the integrity to agree so he and his wife will send their child to a distant planet: Earth.
Thereafter, Superman has a 'normal childhood' with Glenn Ford(a rural farmer); a transformation into Superman at a fortress of solitude; his newspaper job with the Daily Planet in Metropolis(New York?); and so the legend grows.
The film was made with a sense of humor(Gene Hackman and Ned Beaty), drama, and pathos.  It's more than just a comic book brought to life.  In many ways, it was 3 films in one: the first part was true science fiction, with weighty themes presented by the lead marquee star: Marlon Brando.  The 2nd part was a family story, childhood on the farm(briefly told).  The 3rd and final part, the only part that was Superman as we know him, had him in Metropolis, fighting 'bad guys' and doing super things.  All in all, it will seem like you've experienced all the wonders of the world in just 146 minutes of screen time...",1427500800,2,1732,4.522435897435898

606299,5,6303212263,"Before the doomed planet Krypton explodes, Jor-El and wife Lara send their infant son, Kal-El, to Earth to save his life. Discovered in a field and raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent, Kal-Elrenamed Clarkgrows up to discover he has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. After leaving the farm after high school, Clark heads north and meets a holographic projection of Jor-El and learns who he really is and what he is meant to do. Twelve years later, Clark re-enters the world and becomes Superman, a symbol of hope in a world that desperately needs it.

Upon observing Supermans debut, the greatest criminal mind of our time, Lex Luthor, hatches a clever real estate scheme to destroy the Man of Steel while also making himself filthy rich.

With millions of lives in the balance as well as his own, can Superman stop Lex and put an end to the madmans plan?

Like most kids, I watched this flick a thousand times. Okay, maybe not a thousand, but as often as I could considering my parents taped it for me and I knew how to work the VCR. At one point, I think we even had a VHS tape that had all four Superman movies on it from when they aired on TV. Anyway, Ill freely admit this review is totally biased as were talking about a movieespecially a Superman moviefrom my childhood, and its impossible for me to watch the movie now without memories of being a kid, holding my Superman action figure and watching Superman catch Lois Lane falling from a helicopter thats stuck on the side of a building.

That said, this movie is still aces for loads of reasons. One, it was taken seriously. I read somewhere that Christopher Reevewho plays Superman/Clark Kentput forth that he wanted to do it straight-laced. Up until then, you had the Batman TV series for men in tights (unless you counted the Green Hornet TV series, which was semi-serious), and then the cartoons. There was the George Reeves Adventures of Superman series in the 50s and the Kirk Allen series before that, but in terms of immediate superheroes in people memory, you had 60s Batman and that was it.

By taking the source material seriously, by playing Superman as if its really happening, this was the first time audiences were treated to superheroes in real life and the filmmakers weren't kidding when they said, Youll believe a man can fly. I know I did, both now and when I was a kid. Superman was larger than life on the screen, whether he was using his powers or not. He inspired hope, and the film didn't shy away from showcasing a Superman that fought for Truth, Justice and the American Way.

We got to see Superman enjoy being Superman, especially during his first night out saving a cat stuck in a tree, stopping Air Force One from falling to the ground, apprehending a jewel thief and putting an end to a criminal/police car chase.

Christopher Reeve as Superman has been the benchmark every other Superman actor has tried to reach. His Superman is bold, idealistic, hopeful and kind. As Clark Kent, mild mannered reporter for the Daily Planet, he did a fine job of really making you believe he was two different people when all he really had to use was a change of clothes, a new hairstyle and a pair of glasses. The guy changed his voice, his mannerisms, his speecheverything. I bought it. Go ahead. Put a picture of the two side-by-side and its like two different guys, so I don't believe it when people nowadays say a pair of glasses is a stupid idea to conceal your identity. Ever have someone you know really well not recognize you after a haircut? Its happened to me and thats just a haircut not something covering part of my face like glasses. Anyway . . .

Margot Kidder was a solid Lois Lane: brash, driven and totally obsessed with Superman while being dismissive of Clark Kent. Her way of treating the two totally made the bizarre love triangle that is Superman/Lois/Clark work. Aside from some bad decisions that maybe we wouldnt expect a smart-as-a-whip reporter to make, she still sold it.

Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. His version was good. I don't know much about the comics of the time, so I cant say how faithful he was. But in terms of being a good villain, for sure. And he was a bad guy here, an actual criminal and not the revered-but-shady businessman he would later become in the comics world.

The overall story: hey, its simple, but so were most movies back then. At the same time, the superhero movies of todayas good as they arecould learn a lot from Superman and sometimes keeping things simple instead of just non-stop explosions and action is the better way to go. So much more room for character development and interaction.

This review wouldnt be complete without mentioning John Williamss iconic score. The Theme from Superman is right up there with Beethovens Sixth. You play the tune anywhere and people recognize it. Its iconic, inspiring, heroic and like one of the folks who worked on the movie saidI think it was Richard Donner himselfyou can actually hear the song say the word, Superman.

Watch this movie. Just watch it.

Youll believe a man can fly.

They did a great job with preserving this, and although the extended features are a tad extraneous and really not necessary (and how could Lois Lane as a girl on the train appear YOUNGER than Clark Kent and yet later in the film Margot Kidder looks OLDER than Chris Reeve? Ok, minor gripe.) The film looks great and the dynamic colors of Superman's costume just shine out so brightly that you really believe this is a comic book character in the real world (unlike many of the digital, special-effects over-saturated super hero movie messes we get today). Chris Reeve is flawless as Superman/Clark Kent, Gene Hackman is the perfect Lex Luthor, and this film just has everything you'd want in a comic movie. It's also fine for the whole family, with only a couple spots of profanity and some innuendo. The special effects are amazing for a pre-CGI era - you really do believe that Chris Reeve can fly sometimes.

I also really appreciate that there's a 'music only' option specifically for the music of John Williams.

I would like to know who else was up for any of the other parts.

We can sort of chuckle now at some of the corny lines Christopher Reeves delivers but he seemed truer to the comic book Superman than this modern re-imaginings where the fun of the character has been systematically squeezed out. Superman is a square and should remain that way. I guess he might be considered the straight man in this universe. I have yet to get to the George Reeve Superman meets the Mole Men. It is very short and runs just under a hour. I thought it was a feature length film released in theaters but it was probably bulked up by cartoons, news reel footage, etc. I have already seen a few of the magnificent Max Fleisher Superman carttons.

606464,5,6303212263,"Superman: The Movie is a film based on the DC Comics character of the the caped crusader known to everyone as Superman. It tells the story of the caped crusader from his infancy when he was known as Kal-El from Planet Krypton;when he grew up in Smallville realizing that he he powers that no other human beings possess; and his life as a superhero who helps people from criminals and when he disguised himself as a bumbling reporter named Clark Kent at Metropolis.

After many years since it has been released from theaters,I personally still consider this as the best Superman film ever released on screen. It has drama,humor,tension,romance and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the viewer gets to view the caped crusader more than just a superhero but also a human being with emotions and weaknesses that one could relate too especially when it presents parts of the film such as his relationship with his late father Jor-El at the North Pole,his love story with Lois Lane and acknowledging his limitations in terms of doing everything for the people in planet Earth. The filmmakers definitely provided as a hero that has depth in character in terms of his humanity and vulnerability and not just a superhero who is just able to stop villains at will. Aside from that,the cast was simply great from Marlon Brando,Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve.

Many Superman movies have been released after this but no other film has yet been able to recapture the greatness of this film as it remains a timeless classic.

Handsome, polite and genuinely ever-caring, he is there seemingly... just in the knick of time. His payment? A sincere ""Thank You!"" will do him, just fine. Actor Christopher Reeves is an absolute match for the lead role of this courageous and wonderful, super hero. And his depiction of the saving crusader from another planet, is believable and engaging. After all, who doesn't like SUPERMAN? Distinguished Actor - Marlon Brando, is excellent in his role of Jorel, Superman's' father. Who was a brilliant scientist and a just and righteous attorney on his own planet. Ka-lel, later renamed by the earth's populous, as: SUPERMAN, was the only child and son of Jorel, was sent off to earth not only to serve the people but also, for the saving of his own life, as well. For the Planet Kripton was doomed. This endearing saga of comic book invention, is a favorite with every new generation.

SUPERMAN, who matures out of boyhood seclusion after having left, the solitude of the countryside and grows into manhood and comes to understand, his mission and purpose on the Planet Earth. A memorable thrill and a wonderful treat to watch, enjoy and treasure. A family movie with values and a relaxing, entertaining, DVD keeper for everyone. The very best of all of the SUPERMAN movies.

I bought the Superman 5 Film Collection a while ago, but I'm just now getting around to watching it. I decided to watch them all with my 5-year-old son, Jayden, which made for a pretty entertaining experience. If I've seen these movies before,it was a long time ago and I don't really remember them; and I knowJaydenhasn't seen them. So you're getting our reactions hereto uswatching the movies for (basically)the first time. I'm not including screenshots, so if you've watched this movie recently, it'll probably make more sense--but hopefully I've described things well enough that you can follow along. Here are my thoughts, as well as Jayden's behaviors during the movie. I hope you find them as entertaining as I did!

<h2>
Superman: The Movie (Expanded Edition)</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is it, man. The original superhero movie from 1978 about the original superhero, as played by Christopher Reeve--the subject of so many ironic jokes from my youth about when he broke his back falling off a horse.</li>
<li>We start off with a kid going through an issue of <em>Action Comics </em>from 1938. Why we start with this is not explained. It's a pretty weird way to open the movie. Made me think maybe the Marvel movies are mirroring this when they do their comic flip-book thing at the beginning of all of their movies?</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Starts putting his juice boxes in the fridge.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>These old movies tend to have super-long opening credit sequences. I was going to fast-forward through the credits--but WAIT! That theme song! ""Oh, snap!""</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Begins humming the Superman theme music and conducting invisible orchestra with imaginary conductor's baton.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<em>FOUR MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS OF HUMMING THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE TITLE CREDITS, the song finally ends.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""That was awesome!""</strong>

<strong>Finishes putting up all but one of his juice boxes and begins slurping on that one.</strong>

<em>The movie starts by showing an establishing shot of Krypton, zooming in from the outer atmosphere.</em>

<strong>J: ""Why that red planet getting bigger?""</strong>

<em>The camera zooms in past the atmosphere of Krypton.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""What's that blue planet? ...That's Superman's home I guess.""</strong>

<em>The camera zooms in to thedome on Planet Krypton, within which Jor-El and the Council are condemning Zod and his cronies for something</em>.

<strong>J: ""What's that?!""</strong>

<strong>Done withthe juice box.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Those giant faces of Jor-El's contemporaries kind of remind me of all the other big faces we see for abstract leadership councils, i.e., S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ""World Security Council"" or <em>True Blood</em>'s Authority.</li>
<li>Marlon Brando (Jor-El) talks funny. He says ""crypt'n"" instead of ""Krypt- On"".</li>
<li>Oooh, when Jor-El condemns Zod to the Phantom Zone, Zod threatens ""his heirs"". You think that's some foreshadowing for <em>Superman II</em>?</li>
</ul>

<em>The dome opens so they can shoot Zod and his peeps into the Phantom Zone.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""Uh oh! I didn't see this part in a while. Why their mouths moving? Woah! What is that thing?""</strong>

<strong>*Dramatic fake scream.* </strong>

<strong>*Burp*</strong>

<strong>""Sorry 'bout that.""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Wow, those Kryptonians have really bright, shiny clothes.</li>
<li>That's a brilliant back and forth Jor-El has with Lara about sending Kal-El to Earth, with Lara listing the negatives and Jor-El the positives.</li>
<li>Aaaaaaand, there's Naked Baby Superman!</li>
<li>I bet those clear plastic crystal thingies would make great bongs.</li>
<li>Krypton's blowing up. I know this was made in 1978, but those are still some pretty cheesy effects. The Kryptonians falling into the lava and screaming are pretty terrible.</li>
<li>Having now seen Krypton blow up in the original <em>Superman </em>movie, it's pretty obvious how heavily this influenced <em><strong><a href=""[...], what with its Planet Vegeta blowing up and them sending Kakarot to Earth and all....</li>
<li>Dang, when Naked Baby Superman is travelling past the exploded Planet Krypton, he passes by Zod & Co. in the Phantom Zone thing!</li>
<li>All I can think about when I see the Naked Baby Superman in his capsule is what is he eating and where is he pooping?</li>
<li>Alright, so years have passed with him in the capsule listening to Jor-El. He's no longer Naked Baby Superman, now he's Naked Toddler Superman.</li>
<li>He's been in the capsule for like3 years now. Wait a minute, how in the heckdid Jor-El record3 years worth of instruction for Baby Kal? Or is it just the same lessons over and over on repeat? Man, that'd get old real quick....</li>
<li>Now Kal-El is on Earth. Here's the iconic scene with the Kent's red pickup truck--the scene that all the ""What If...?""/Elseworlds go back to.</li>
<li>3-year-old Boy Superman Penis, front and center!</li>
<li>Hey, Martha Kent wrapped a red blanket around Boy Superman that looks suspiciously likea cape!</li>
<li>So, we get Baby Superman, and now he's in his teens? Gee, this is kinda like the Jesus story.</li>
<li>Wait a minute, isn't Lana Asian? That's how she was on <em>Smallville</em>. She's a ginger in this movie?</li>
</ul>

<em>Clark angrily kicks the football.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""Wooooah""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<em>Clark runs alongside the train.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""When are we gonna see him flying?""</strong>

<strong>Loses interest and starts coming to see what I'm doing. Gets a pen and paper and starts writing.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Wow, the way Jonathan Kent dies here is SOOOOO much better than in <em><strong><a href=""[...]""_blank"">Man of Steel</a></strong></em>! I'll take a heart attack over a freaking tornado any day. And here, Clark <em>couldn't</em> have saved him, no matter what, whereas in <em>Man of Steel</em>he didn't save him because... <em>Man of Steel</em>was stupid? Not being able to save his dad (rather than not saving him because he told him not to) has to have serious implications for Clark's becoming Superman.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: ""Why can't I write on my hands with this pen? It'll be on there forever?""</strong>

<strong>""There, now look."" He has drawn a faceguy (head, hair, hands, feet--no body). ""I'm gonna save that one for Mommy.""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Wait, what's that green crystal in the floor of the Kents' barn? Is that Kryptonite? And what about that green crystal Jor-El stuck in Baby Superman's capsule? Wouldn't that have made him sick?</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: ""Daddy, looooook."" He's drawn another face guy.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<em>Clark decides it's time to leave home, to head out to the big city. </em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: Still drawing</strong>.

<ul>
<li>It's taken 40 minutes, almost half the movie, to get Superman's Origin Story. Grant Morrison did it in <a href=""[...]"">4 panels in <em>All-Star Superman</em></a>. But would Morrison's have worked without <em>Superman: The Movie</em>?</li>
<li>OK, how the heck did Clark get to... where is that? Antarctica? Here's one part where <em><strong><a href=""[...]"">Man of Steel</a></strong> </em>was actually better, showing Clark travelling the world, working one odd-job after the otheruntil he revealed his powers, then moving on to the next, and naturally finding his way to the old Kryptonian space ship. In <em>Superman: The Movie</em>, Clark is just there at the Fortress of Solitude.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Wondering the same thing, ""Is that Earth or in outer space? How he got there? What he gonna do there?""</strong>

<strong>""I think I'm gonna write something else on new paper.""</strong>

<em>Clark throws a crystal or something.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""Now that's what I call for.""</strong>

<em>The Fortress of Solitude rises.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""HUH? Woah woah woah woah woah wow wow""</strong>

<ul>
<li>Clark sticking his crystal inthe tubes like thatmakes me think they're like bongs again.</li>
<li>Wow, Jor-El really planned this out! He had like3 years of lessons for Kal-El's trip to Earth, now he's got even more stuff recorded to say to him here? Or is it more like in <em>Man of Steel</em>, where this is supposed to be Jor-El's consciousness uploaded to the crystal/computer? If so, they should've said so.</li>
<li>When Jor-El asks what Clark wants to know, Clark's first and onlyquestion is, ""Who am I?"" Kind of like in <em>The Matrix </em>when the Oracle tells Neo the sign above her kitchen door is Latin for, ""Know thyself"".</li>
<li>And now Jor-El takes Clark on a trippy mind-trip. They're gone for, like, years... like, 10 years. Might this mind-trip have something to do with all those bong parrallels I see in the crystal tubes?</li>
<li>Hey, this is like Jesus again! We only get Jesus's story from when he's a baby, then when he's a kid he runs off and goes to the temple, then he comes back to save the world when he's 33.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Has me spell out ""SUPERMAN"" so he can write it.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Oh, snap, there's Superman! The music! The costume! Flight!</li>
<li>At the Daily Planet, the Chief actually says ""mild-mannered reporter"" when describing Clark.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Takes pen apart. Is fascinated with the ink stick.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>God, 70s clothes and mustaches were <em>awful</em>!</li>
<li>Wow, when Clark gets stuck in the rotating door behind Lois, you see just how great an actor Christopher Reeve was. He played such a great bumbling Clark!</li>
<li>Dang, the streets of Metropolis are no joke! Clark and Lois just got robbed at gunpoint in broad daylight!</li>
</ul>

<em>Clark knocks Lois out of the way and catches the robber's bullet in his hand.</em>

<strong>J: ""What! You gotta be kidding me!"" </strong>

<strong>He goes back to writing, this time, ""FANTASTIC FOUR"" and ""HULK"".</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Wow, they don't waste any time establishing this guy (Otto) as the stereotypical bad-guy. He's literally stealing from the blind.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: ""DADDY DADDY DADDY CAN YOU PAUSE IT NOW PLEASE! QUICK!""</strong>

<strong>(Pee break--that juice box caught up with him.)</strong>

<strong>""You can unpause it now.""</strong>

<strong>Back to writing.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Around this time I start wondering about that 1939 <em>Action Comics </em>comic from the beginning. So was that a framing device we'll come back to at the end of the movie, or why was that there?</li>
<li>Wow, so Otto's a bad-guy because he stole a scone from the blind newsstand owner, but Lex Luthor's really evil: he just made the cop that was tailing Otto get pushed in front of the subway train. There are no blood splatters, however, only a hat....</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Goes to get his crayons.</strong>

<ul>
<li>So all we know about Lex Luthor is he's a villain with an underground lair. Why does he keep these two ""nincompoops"" around him? Who are they? Could he really afford no better goons? And why does ""Miss Tessmacher"" hang around Lex if she's hating on his lair like that?</li>
<li>Wow, Lois is almost a feminist in her progressiveness, talking about ""seeing how the other side lives"", her sister with the ""two kids, three cats"", etc.</li>
<li>Dang, Christopher Reeve does such a <em>perfect </em>Bumbling Clark.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Randomly shouts""WHAABAAAM!"" as he slams a piece of paper down on the footrest.</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Lois is in the helicopter, I think it's time for her to be rescued...! Andthere he is! The music! The phone booth! The shirt ripping open! It's Superman!</li>
<li>I love the Cool Jive Brother who compliments Superman, ""That's a baaad outfit. Woooh!""</li>
<li>Lois says that classic line, ""You-You've got me? Who's got you?""</li>
</ul>

<em>Superman flys offinto the night after rescuing Lois.</em>

<strong>J: Starts humming Superman theme song.</strong>

<strong>""Wo-o-o-o-o-oww!""</strong>

<strong>Starts karate chopping pieces of paper.</strong>

<em>Superman stops the stereotypical thief who's using the stereotypical suction cups to climbthe stereotypical high-rise building.</em>

<strong>J: ""How is he doing that?!""</strong>

<strong>""Hey Daddy I can throw this really far like Superman!""</strong>

<strong>Throws some balled-up pieces of paper.</strong>

<ul>
<li>So Superman just saved a cat from a tree. Was all of this cliche before this movie, or is it cliche because of this movie? </li>
<li>Holy crap, I'm pretty sure that little girl's mother just slapped her and scolded her for lying when she tried to tell her about the man swooping out of the sky to rescue her kitty! Thanks a lot, Superman!</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Asks me to make a paper airplane.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Superman goes back to the Fortress of Solitude and tells Jor-El there's no <em>way</em>he could've imagined and planned forall of this! Thank you! How <em>did</em> you plan for all of this, Jor-El?</li>
<li>Jor-El tells Superman to keep his identity secret so his friends won't get hurt by the bad-guys. Wow, Superman's Dad had to tell him--Spider-Man figured that part out all on his own.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: ""I think I'm hungry for a snack.""</strong>

<em></em>

<em>Pause, snack break.</em>

<em>...</em>

<em>Back with crackers and cheese.</em>

<ul>
<li>Ithought smoking was still cool in the 70s, but Superman just scolded Lois for it. Whew, she doesn't have lung cancer yet! (Were anti-smoking ads a thing back then?)</li>
<li>Lois interviews Superman and starts to ask him if his penis works but then changes it to asking if he eats. He saysyeah, he eats. OK, so if he eats, then that means he poops too, right? So what'd he do for those THREE YEARS AS A BABY in his capsule, huh? Where'd he poop then?! (Sorry, we just had a new baby boya month ago and hehas me really worried about poop.)</li>
<li>Hey why does Superman say ""Krypt-On"" if his dad Jor-El(Marlon Brando) says ""cripten"" and that's the only way he's ever heard his history? Shouldn't he pronounce it like Jor-El does?</li>
<li>Oh Lord, Superman just X-ray-visioned Lois's panties. She asked him if he likes pink!</li>
<li>""Truth, justice, and the American way."" ""I never lie."" Wow, I think I get it now. For the longest time, these things seems antiquated and corny and were the reason I never liked Superman. But now I get it. He's pure. He's good. He's a hero. He is THE hero. So <em>this </em>is why people love Superman so much! And this is why people were so mad at <em>Man of Steel</em>....</li>
<li>Jeez, Superman and Lois Lane sure are spending a loooong time flying around New York. But, I guess, back in 1978 people hadn't really seen anything like this before.</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: Still eating crackers.</strong>

<strong>Makes them into a circle and yells, ""TADAH!""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Hold up, it doesn't seem like the physics is right there. If Lois is just holding his hand like that, wouldn't she-- yep, she fell.</li>
<li>This is a really really weird inner monologue poem from Lois.</li>
<li>She just straight-up called him a god. Really Jor-El would be God though, if we're going with this whole Superman/Jesus parrallel that's pretty obvious at this point in the movie... but Lois doesn't know that.</li>
<li>And now we see what is one of the longest continuous shots ever. It's amazing how Superman turns into Clark Kent behind the door like that, in the time it takes Lois to come up with the name ""Superman"", without a cut in the shot.</li>
<li>Christopher Reeve was a heckuvan actor. I love it when he takes his glasses off, smirks, and stands up tall.</li>
<li>Aw, come on, Supes! You gonna try to tell her your secret identity already?! It's just the first movie, dawg!</li>
<li>So now Miss Techmacher is wearing a pant suit? Last time she was in her lingerie, I figured Luthor made her always hang aroundin his undergroundlair wearing that. What's up with her? Why is she there?</li>
<li>Lex Luthor figures out Superman's weaknesses from Lois's interview with him in <em>The Daily Planet</em>. (Doh!) He also figures out that Superman landed on Earth in 1948, 3 years after Krypton blew up (making Superman 33 years old at the time of this movie--like Jesus!), and that any chunks of Krypton that would've landed on Earth as meteorites would be harmful to Superman. (Wow, Luthor's smart)</li>
<li>Luthor's got Miss Techmacher laid out like she crashed her car. Those military dudes are pervs, all trying to get up on her.</li>
<li>WHY does Luthor keep Ottis around? WHY would he trust him with such an important mission to change the coordinates on the missile?</li>
</ul>

<em>Lex Luthor targets Superman's ears alone with a subsonic message. Clark jumps out a window at the Daily Planet and doesn't even bother spinning in circles, let alone ducking into a phone booth--he just flashes and changes into his costume.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""Woah I didn't know he can do that!""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<em>Superman spins in circles and drills a hole into the Earth.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""I didn't know he can do that too! You gotta be kidding me!""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<em>Superman runs the gauntlet Lex has set up for him: bullets, fire, and ice.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""He's indestructible!""</strong>

<ul>
<li>Is this camp? How much was this movie influenced by the 1966<em>Batman </em>TV show?</li>
<li>And now the villain reveals his master scheme: to buy real estate inland, and then hit the San Andreas Faultwith a missileto cause California to sink into the ocean, giving him oceanfront property. That is one heckuvan evil plan.</li>
<li>Lex also calls Superman, ""Supe Baby"", and that'll forever be my nickname for him.</li>
<li>Superman tells Lex his plan will fail, but Lex informs Superman that it's already history. Holy crap Alan Moore ripped off this scene for that part in <em>Watchmen</em>! (<a href=""[...]"">""I did it 35 minutes ago.""</a>)</li>
<li>The other missile's headed to Hackensack, New Jersey? That's awfully random. Oh, wait, OK, that's where Miss Techmacher's mother lives. It all makes sense now...? Shouldn't she have asked where she was reprogramming these missiles for when she agreed to do it? What does Lex have over her and Ottis to keep them there with him? And why does he want to blow up her mother's town?</li>
<li>Wow, Luthor has a live feed to the missiles.</li>
<li>Impact: San Andreas! Oh dang, he did it!</li>
<li>There's some girl scouts getting crushed by the Hollywood sign! That's terrible!</li>
</ul>

<em>Superman flies into the San Andreas Fault and pushes it back up. But other cracks open in the Earth.</em>

<strong>J: It's makin another one!""</strong>

<strong></strong>

<ul>
<li>Seriously Lois, you ran out of gas? Why didn't you check your gas before driving out into the desert?</li>
</ul>

<em>Superman saves a small town by pushing a large rock in front of a flood of water that's about to wipe the town out.</em>

<strong></strong>

<strong>J: ""That's a huge rock!""</strong>

<ul>
<li>Aww, dang, Lois died, smothered in her car. Man, I don't remember Lois dying, that's kind of sad--wait a minute... this is that part where Superman flies backwards around the Earth to reverse time, isn't it? Yep, he's doing it. He's flying backwards around the Earth to reverse time. I don't think time travel or physics or science or even science-fiction works that way, Supe Baby.</li>
<li>But it worked here! And Lois is OK! And she still has ugly yellow 70s smoker's teeth.</li>
<li>Superman then drops Lex and Otis off at the prison... I don't think the prison system works that way either, Supe Baby. Lex and Ottis will walk right back out of there because of, you know, those little things like Miranda rights and proof of any crime whatsoever....</li>
</ul>

<strong>J: ""Is it over yet?""</strong>

<em>Superman flies off into space. The classic Superman theme song starts up. End credits roll.</em>

<em></em>

<strong>J: ""Hey this musicis just like on my game <em>LEGO Batman 2</em>!""</strong>

<strong>Hums the Superman theme song all the way out.</strong>

606549,5,6303212263,"Superman is a timeless character.  It is therefore only fitting that his big-screen debut is as enjoyable today as it was when it first came out in 1978.  Director Richard Donner and star Christopher Reeve truly made us all believe that a man could fly.  One might say that it was the cast's more corny moments that made this film so memorable, but for me, it was the cast's efforts at properly portraying their characters that made this film so memorable.  Besides, isn't Jimmy Olsen always a bit corny and awkward?  Of course the flick's reigning champion of corny and awkward is Clark Kent.  Christopher Reeve perfectly captured the nerdy qualities that the world's most powerful man used to hide his identity.  Some might say this runs against my earlier point, but remember...Clark Kent was purposely acting that way to deflect anyone's suspicions of him being Superman.  Well, I'd say ""mission accomplished"".  Mr. Reeve is a pleasure to watch throughout this film and his extraordinary on-screen presence is perfectly matched by Gene Hackman, playing Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor.  I've only seen this super-baddie in the 1990s animated series and in a couple of old comic strips, but to see this live representation of the villain's mad-scientist persona was a welcome change.  It was especially nice to see that he was in no way watered down to a family-friendly level, a fact he proves almost immediately by coldly murdering a police officer who was tailing one of his henchmen.  My one complaint lies with Mr. Hackman's refusal to shave his head for the role, forcing the studio to set up a believable scenario in which Lex Luthor frequently wears wigs.  I've just never known this man to shy away from any aspect of himself, so this was just a bit disappointing.  Margot Kidder was a fine Lois Lane, serving as more than just Superman's arm candy and giving the character personality quirks which have endured for many films to come.  I'm always in favor of seeing imperfect good guys and Miss Kidder satisfied my desires 100%.  The film's cast was complimented by a great plot that never had an out-of-character moment.  Like many, I wasn't a fan of the time-traveling twist at the end, but it's been talked about so much that I won't beat it to death any further.  Otherwise, the ending was quite something, especially for way back in 1978.  Overall, if you haven't seen this film, don't waste any more time.  Go...go get it now.  It's a must-have for anyone who's ever heard of the Man of Steel.  Enjoy.",1401494400,,2524,4.793981481481482

I remember when I first saw this roughly 35 years ago in a giant screen theater in Portland.  I was agog, it was so well done.  I was digesting the impact of this movie for a couple days.  Some aspects of it are a bit dated now but the basic story is still pretty powerful.

I've loved Superman since I was a kid watching George Reeves when I was still in my single-digits (I'm 62 now) and loved the coincidence of Reeves and Reeve playing the same role. I'm even enjoying the old 1940's radio show with Bud Collyer as Superman (see [...]  for many episodes).

I'm glad to see that we have two different versions of the movie, the 1978 theatrical and the 2000 expanded edition. (I hope the latter includes many of the scenes that were added for the expanded TV version of the movie (which I used to have on video tape until my sister threw out all my tapes thinking they were only worth a dime each)

Mostly, today, I'm satisfied watching movies with free streaming from Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc., but for movies like Superman, I have to have my own copy. I don't know how many times I've watched my earlier versions of the movie, but I will be watching this set multiple more times.

606629,5,6303212263,"Christopher reeve is the one and only Superman
Warner bros have tried their best to get other actors in the role
when warner bros made and released SUPERMAN RETURNS and MAN OF STEEL
but in my opinion no actor has come close to the way Chris reeve portrayed Superman
part of my opinion for saying that is that i grew watching this 1978 version on TV during the 80'S
so as a fan i think it's a big insult that Warner bros have tried or are trying to remake the film
or reboot the series

for me i am still faithful to the original 1978 classic, i havn't bothered trying to watch MAN OF STEEL
just to see if Warner bros has successfully remade the film
just thinking about it, i find insulting
Richard Donner's version is old school film-making at it's best, no CGI, Computer Generated image
which is why i think the film is still a classic and still hold up today
but it's not Just Richard Donner directing the film
the Actors,Actress's in the film are fantastic, Great performances
Gene Hackman, Margot kidder, Jackie cooper, Marlon brando and of course Christopher reeve
all nailed their parts
the screenplay was very well written
the Cinematography was excellent
plus the music score is incredible, fantastic score by John williams, no Doubt about it
other film composers have come close but have never nailed the theme

this blu-ray version is fantastic, the picture quality looks beautiful in HD with a new Master audio 5.1 surround sound
much better than the DVD release
this blu-ray release has only the Extended cut version that was made by Richard Donner,
151mins long which includes the end credits
plus all the extras/featurettes from the dvd release are on this blu-ray aswell.

There is another version SUPERMAN which has never ever been officially released on DVD before
and might not ever be officially released actually
the 2hrs and 50mins (170mins) version which was only broadcast for TV during the 80's and 90's
it was a 2 night TV broadcast
the U.S. TV network at the time made a deal with the Salkinds for a longer cut on TV
this version is the Producers cut which included all the Deleted scenes from the Theatrical release
and also included some outtake scenes aswell
all the Deleted scenes for the TV broadcast are found on this blu-ray in the special features section

i remember watching this version during the 80'S, it was broadcast more than once for the superman fans
in my opinion this 170mins longer cut is the best version available for any fan of superman
i think Warner bros still hold the copyrights to this 170mins cut
but for some reason Warner bros have not or will not officially released this on DVD or blu-ray yet
 and might never release it

this 170mins is only available as a bootleg dvd copy
it is very very rare to find cause it's a bootleg which are illegal to sell
i think the only chance you got is to download the TV extended cut from the many Download websites.
Otherwise try to do a google search and see if you can buy it from a Bootleg dvd website

as for me
one of the last ever times this special producers cut was TV broadcasted back in the 90's
which i had recorded on VHS tape not knowing at all that the version i was recording
was the extended Producers cut, i had to pause the recording when all the commercials were on
otherwise i would run out of tape
the whole tv broadcast came to just under 3hrs without the commercials
being the last time this version was broadcast to TV from what i remember
the whole movie was run for 1 night from 8:30 til 12;30, 4 hour run with the commercials in

anyway fast forward 10 years later i find out i still have the 170mins cut on VHS
i realized this version was a unique version and probably won't be released on DVD officially at all
so i got the whole film transferred to DVD quality in Fullframe format of course
to transfer this tv version in Digital remastered picture and audio would've cost me hundreds of dollars for sure
so i didn't bother paying that much

so i just got a straight transfer to DVD Disc which i think is better for the film
than to leave the footage on dust Video tape

Hopefully one day Warner bros will officially release this 170mins version of the film on blu-ray
but don't hold your breath, i'll be surprised if it ever happens
but for now this 151mins blu-ray release of the film will have to do.
i gave it 5 stars no Doubt about it.",1395446400,3,4366,4.453066332916145

Picked this up recently and wanted to show my daughters (6 and 8), so I watched it again solo to make sure I wasn't forgetting something that was inappropriate for said ages. There isn't. And they both loved it when I showed it to them.

And so did I. It had been a long time and I had forgotten just how good this movie is. Some of the effects are a little dated (though not nearly as much as you'd think going in) and the odd wardrobe decision is now brow-raising, but the story, the acting and the sheer fun and enthusiasm are first rate. In fact, I recommend this very much to those who get a little bogged down by the current need for heroes to be anguished and tortured souls.

I love comic book movies. I love to see my heroes onscreen. But, I dare any comic book movie to match what was done in this film. Many have tried. ALL have failed! Superman Returns and Man of Steel tried (Man of Steel tried hard esp. in the supporting cast), but fell short. CGI makes Superman fly and I'm just not convinced of it. I don't feel that sense of wonder with the new movies and I doubt I ever will. And I'm not just a 40 year old fogey either. My 2 teens say Reeves performances; even in the inferior 3 and 4 are better than Routh and Cavill. It's not to say we won't go to see new movies. Its just that for most of my generation, there's always going to be a little disappointment, a little less conviction in CGI and a little sadness when we think about Chris and it does detract from new movies.

The casting is flawless, the light touch, yet respectful treatment of the Superman legend (starting with a child looking through Action Comics, the first appearance of Superman) rings all the bells for a lifelong Superman fan like me.

Sure, the CGI and models aren't as perfect as they are 35 years later, but so what? Even at their worst, they're still not bad. And everything else that makes you really form an attachment to a movie - characters, storyline, plot, emotional appeal - with 'Superman' is off the chart in how superb it is.

606898,3,6303212263,"I loved this film when it was released in theaters.  Superman was my introduction to movie superheroes and I held the memory fondly.  The decades has tarnished the experience and this blu-ray's ""extended"" edit only amplified some of the problems.  Its now a mixed bag with some very strong material dragged down by some very bad moments that were more acceptable decades ago but which don't play well now.

Everything involving Superman's background story is very, very good.  You get rock solid performances from everyone.  In this intro, you have Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford and they give some of the best on-screen artistry you will ever find.  The acting in the rest of the film is also good, with Gene Hackman shining above the rest.

Unfortunately, when Superman actually appears, things go downhill.  Reeves does well with the bumbling Clark Kent role.  Kidder comes off as selfish and unlikeable and is a damsel in distress that you don't really care about saving.  Reeves goes through the motions with one exploit after the other but there isn't much worth watching beyond Gene Hackman's portrayal as Lex Luther.

And that's where the extended cut really fails.  It minimizes Hackman as a nemesis and focuses on Reeves in a lot of badly matted flying scenes that really suffer on an HDTV.  Superman's heroics towards the end of the film are so over the top as to make any of his efforts seem silly.  (To be fair, I found these events tolerable when I first saw the film but now they really wear thin.)  The extended cut only amplifies the weak issues and buries the really good parts.  In the end, you're looking at a film that was definitely a product of its time and should be enjoyed for great performances by some fine actors but which wavers badly in its modern presentation.

If you can get the original theater release I'd go with that.  They edited it that way for a reason.",1391472000,2,1892,4.678787878787879

This is just a minor thing, as I give this film a lot of praise, especially the development of the characters, particularly Lois Lane and Clark Kent. For its time, Superman was a breakthrough film in terms of special effects, but probably wouldn't garner the same response today when it comes to the overall story.

This movie and the second one rate as two of the best superhero movies of all time!. Christopher Reeve does a 'Super' job as does most of the cast. I would have preferred to see Lex Luthor played a little more *straight* - a little less comedy.

The plot is pretty good as was the acting - except for the comedy - just a little too much of it. I'm glad it had some comedy as the 'Man of Steel' had none and boy did it need a little. Special effects were great for the time period - the 'you'll believe a man can fly' tagline turned out to be true.

The flying sequences compared to any before - well - they're like night and day - they are MUCH, MUCH better.

I would rate this a very high 9.00 to 9.25 out of 10 stars. The only way this could have been improved is to very slightly tone down the comedy. It wouldn't have taken much - just a little less please.

Superman - The Movie (1978) starring Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman is a very solid superhero movie, a very solid Superman movie.  The acting is good, the action is plentiful, and the special effects are great for the time period it was made.  I've seen Superman Returns (2006) and Man Of Steel (2013).  These movies were good, but I prefer the original older ones, including Superman II (1980).  They are just all around better, in my opinion.

I'm not really into Superman all that much (I much prefer Batman), but once in a blue moon I'll watch a Superman movie for its entertainment value, and this movie delivers.  Recommended.",1386288000,2,762,4.852713178294573

607071,4,6303212263,"Superman (1978) Bowling for Movies Score: 249.375 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Superman - we own the DVD of this film which came as part of a combo pack including the other 3 movies spanning the 1970's and 1980's (I will leave a combined Bowling for Movies score here (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Film-Favorites-Superman-Superman-II-Special-Edition-Superman-III-Deluxe-Edition-Superman-IV-Deluxe-Edition-Superman-The-Movie-Special-Edition/dp/B001DJLD2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Film Favorites: Superman (Superman II: Special Edition, Superman III: Deluxe Edition, Superman IV: Deluxe Edition, Superman, The Movie: Special Edition)</a>) when I have them all scored!)

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
This mild-mannered film was a 70's box office smash hit.  Although the mythos of Superman had been well established via comic book and television, never before had the caped crusader taken to the big screen like this - right there on screen, flying faster than a speeding bullet SUPERMAN (ok, I was 7 when the movie came out and you might be able to tell - I fell in love with this franchise).

When bureaucratic stupidity dooms the citizens of Krypton to, er - doom.  Jor-El, an eminent scientist, warns the rulers of the planet that death is coming for dinner but he is looking for love in all the wrong places and is forced to send his only infant son, Kal-El, into a space capsule to save his life (why they didn't just all jump in a Super Family version of the Family Truckster I can't say) but off to the strange planet Earth Kal-El (Kal to his friends) goes.  Along the way Jor-El has seen to his son's education and needs until BOOM, Kal-El crash lands on Earth and in near proximity to the elderly couple, Jonathan (Jon to his friends) and Martha Kent, who decide to take him in and raise Kal-El as their own.  Fun and frolic ensue, Kal-El is renamed Clark and is off to become a mega-nerd in high school and wham bam, suddenly Clark is off to the big city where he adopts the lifestyle of a timid newspaper reporter (remember those?)  He falls in love with a co-worker (guess he didn't get the memo about sexual harassment in the workplace), and fights crime for fun in some righteously cool pajamas... oh, did I mention the fortress of solitude among the arctic ocean ice (remember when there was ice at the poles?)  Enter a diabolical plan by the super villain Lex Luther to have California fall into the Pacific to increase property values in Nevada and Arizona (remember when California had property value?)  Whew - long story short - Superman is here to save the day, Lois (Clark's sexy co-worker) gets squished, and Kal-El breaks the only real rule he's subject to, mainly that of staying out of human affairs - he reverses the direction of the Earth's spin, effectively turning back time, and saving Lois (presumably so she could die of lung cancer at a later date - Lois, didn't you hear?  Smoking stinks and will kill you!).  Oh, and before all that happened, we were treated to a trial of some criminals on Krypton (literally our first encounter with Kryptonians) and they are convicted and sent into space in a giant wall mirror... never to be seen again (except in the next movie which the movie makers seemed pretty sure was going to happen, apparently).

Good Golly - what went right!
The movie can only be described as super - the story was spot on, the special effects were spectacular (pre-CGI days people WOW), Christopher Reeve was Superman (like in my mind forever), the musical score was infectious (I can still hear the theme running in a loop in my head), the villains were villainous... dude - it was simply Super, heck, I'd even add a Duper in there - and talk about tidy whities, I don't know what kind of bleach Mrs. Superman uses but the clothes on Krypton were incredible!

What went wrong!
Ok, the pace was a little slow, the story was a little long, the plot development was kind of silly... can I be Frank?  Ok, from now until the end of the review, you can just call me Frank.  I loved the movie.  The Bowling for Movie score above 200 makes this one heck of a great movie and these little trivial ""problems"" (and problems is too big of a word, like, prob would be better because it was tiny)... these probs only slightly detract from the Super experience - I have only one word of advice - bring POPCORN.

Watched it again recently and was surprised at how uneven the whole film felt. Hackman, Reeve and Kidder are a real treat to watch, especially when playing against each other. Reeve plays two roles here, and knocks 'em both out of the park. However... the movie indulges itself too much at times, veering between genres (Dark comedy, Action, Trippy Sci-fi) with abandon resulting in an uneven tone throughout. The effects are good for the time, but don't hold up as well as other effects-heavy works of the '70's (Star Wars, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, . However, some of the effects in the climax (a miniature town, Superman in lava) are just plain awful compared to the quality of the rest of the film. Again, an uneven tone.

Overall, still a classic and a must watch for superhero fans, if only for historical awareness. Also, the superhero movies of today owe quite a bit to this film and its sequel.

607287,5,6303212263,"Richard Donner's Superman resonates with me like no other superhero film.  I was 10 years old when I first saw Superman: the movie. It's a FUN movie, filled with instantly accessible and likeable characters.  Clark Kent is the product of his powerful and wise Krypton heritage, and his innocent, character-filled Midwestern adoptive parents.  He has god-like powers, but has a humility that grounds him in the most admirable of ways.  His Kryptonian father has sent him to Earth with presumably all the knowledge and wisdom of the Kryptonian civilization encoded in crystals.  All of this power and knowledge Clark uses to protect and inspire the people of his new home on Earth.  Of all Superman's powers the thing that resonated most with me was a statement he made in a conversation with Lois Lane.  He said he stood for truth, justice and the American way.  Lois, then joked that he would be fighting every politician in Washington, but then comes the kicker, Clark responds, 'Lois,  I never lie.'  That's something I can do!!  I thought.  I can be like Superman by always telling the truth!  This is something that has never left me after all these years.  What a beautiful thing for a film to affirm and inspire virtue in children and adults alike.  Of course there is the perfectly diabolical and yet hillarious portrayal of Lex Luthor by the incomparable Gene Hackman, along with his henchmen, Otis, and Miss Tessmacher.  Everyone in the film, right down to the extras was wonderful.  The effects, well, I still love to watch the opening credits, and there are moments where the flying really seems to work, and there are others where it doesn't.  The set design borders on spectacular at times.  Effects in a film are important for bringing the audience into the story, while lapses can cause us to momentarily disengage, but great effects never of themselves make a film memorable.  There is so much to love about this film that it's easy for me to lovingly overlook any technological shortcomings.  Perhaps someday it will be possible to improve those sequences where the effects kill the illusion.

607478,4,6303212263,"Richard Donnor's Superman movie is probably my second favorite incarnation of Superman.  There is not much to say about say about a classic film like this that has not been said already.  Donnor brought the man of steel to the big screen almost perfectly.  I respect this film, because without the superhero movie genre might not have gotten off the ground. There are however, some issues that I have with the film that I will explain later.

This film is played to be more of an epic, and a well done one.  I have not really seen this approach done before in a superhero film.  The film begins with Clark's father Jor El (Marlon Brando) and his mother Laura putting him into the ship going to earth.  You also see the image of Krypton exploding.  In the next sequence we follow Clark growing up with his adopted parents Jonathon and Martha Kent.  We also get glimpses of his life in Smallville.  Then we see him finding out about his origins and who his real parents are.  He seems to spend the rest of his adolescence training with his father Jor El in the Fortress of Solitude.  The next sequence we follow an adult Clark Kent, played by Christopher Reeve, start his life in Metropolis, working at the Daily Planet, and finally becoming Superman.  He also meets Lois Lane, played by Margot Kidder.
More than an hour passes before we actually see Superman do anything.  Normally I do like when a movie takes its sweet time in showing the superhero like with Amazing Spiderman.  This is because many times I find the origin to be boring.  However, this one of the few times where taking its time did not really bother me that much.

Christopher Reeve is phenomenal as both Clark Kent and Superman.  He is able to encompass those two personas with ease.  To many people he is Superman, and I can see why.  To be honest though, I like Superman the animated series with Tim Daly and Justice League better than this, because I grew up with those shows.  However, Reeve is my second favorite Superman.  Margot Kidder does a great job as Lois Lane.  Kidder is probably my favorite Lois.  Reeve and Kidder have great chemistry on screen.

What I do not like is how Lex Luthor is portrayed in this.  Lex comes off as a joke in this, and his part is played up mostly for comedy.  I grew up with the cold calculating business man Lex Luthor.  This Lex is more of a generic Saturday morning cartoon villain bent on taking over the world (or at least a small portion of it) and comes off as more of a nuisance for Superman than an actual threat.

I also did not like the ending.  The way Superman fixes everything in the end makes no sense whatsoever.  Even for a superhero movie with a premise like this, it is silly.  It also is very weird character wise.  It was explained earlier that Superman is forbidden to alter the course of human events, but by the end he does exactly that and suffers no consequence for it.

Overall, despite my complaints, this is a classic movie.  Whether you are a fan of Superman or superheroes in general this is a must see.  However, I am sure everyone already has seen it.",1369526400,,3096,4.44661921708185

607527,1,6303212263,"When i was young I probably watched this movie but I don't remember it. Probably because it wasn't any good. It's a shame because it had the potential to be better. The very first six to seven minute scene in the movie makes no sense at all, it has no relevence to the story. If there is relevence it's left out of the movie which is just as bad. Three bad guys on trial, then the destruction of planet krypton, poor writing. I like how the movie starts in Krypton and they're talking about the destruction of the planet and their send off of Superman. After the man and woman find baby superman it goes sixteen years in time for one scene when his father dies. The scene seems planned and unnatural. We know nothing about his father. Then he finds the Kryptonite which doesn't hurt him, goes to alaska throws it in the water and it creates some type of palace. The end of the movie when Superman spins around the earth and magically the bomb doesn't go off. Why would circling the earth do this. Also the original authors got screwed out of any proceeds for this film which is wrong. Just another case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.

607534,5,6303212263,"As a kid, I did not understand terms such as treason and insurrection while watching this in 1978. I am sure glad to have found this four disc version and appreciate the movie better this time round.

First of all, I thought the casting was excellent:

Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is a little awkward and lacking in confidence, the kind that gets his hand caught in revolving doors. And Reeve did look like Superman physically and he was confident and cool. Very natural in both roles.

Margot Kidder is perfect as the sharp tongued reporter Lois Lane. (Recall Gale Weathers in Scream?) Lois frequently makes spelling mistakes and gets told by her editor there's ""only one p in rapist"". Thank whoever invented spell check. One of Lois' interview questions for Superman was ""How big are you?"" She then changes the question quickly to ""How tall are you?"" What a size queen. LOL.

Gene Hackman turns Lex Luthor into a very funny and likable ""criminal mind of our time"".

Ned Beatty is perfect as the bumbling Otis who constantly goofs up. I think the only reason Luthor keeps him is that Otis is too dense to be a threat.

Valerie Perrine - Lex's va va voom female companion always referred to formally as Miss Teschmacher. Actually, she is pretty kind and smart. One of the funniest scene was when Superman flies through the ceiling sending debris raining down. And Eve Teschmacher just walks calmly away as if oblivious to it all.

This package contains three Superman films:

* The theatrical version.
* The expanded version. Here you get more footage of Marlon Brando's character Jor-El. More on him dealing with the council. You see him explaining to the young Kal-El how to deal with people. Kinds of plugs in the gap about where Superman gets his lessons from. Brando was reportedly paid millions for this. There's also more footage on how Lex tries to destroy Superman.
* A vintage 1951 black and white film starring George Reeves has quirky mole men coming out of the ground.

Extras include making ofs, director commentary, documentaries, several 1940s cartoons, screen tests (watch Stockard Channing from Grease audition for Lois Lane), a vintage TV special and several audio tracks (close to a CD soundtrack).

As a movie, Superman encapsulates drama, comedy, romance and a disaster film all rolled into one. It was very moving at parts. His earth parents found this boy with the outstretched arms and a big smile and raised him as their own. And his father's sudden death when Clark was a teen.

One of the most romantic moments in cinematic history was when Superman takes Lois Lane  flying and the song lyrics to Can You Read My Mind was spoken by Lane.

And it borrows from the Bible. Superman was sent to earth by his father so that he could help people. Just like Jesus Christ who is the spiritual saviour, Superman is the physical saviour. Just as God cast Satan into hell, the three insurrectionists - General Zod, Ursa and Non are condemned by Jor-El to eternal exile in the Phantom Zone. And is it a coincidence that the infant Kal-El travels to earth in a ship shaped like a star? A reference to The Star of Bethlehem when Christ was born?

This movie also runs the constant theme of how aliens are superior to humans. Check out Alien, Predator, Alien Vs Predator, Prometheus and I'm sure there are others.

This 1978 version is a tough act to follow and I don't think even the recent Superman Returns can top it.",1362182400,,3436,4.693843594009984

607573,5,6303212263,"It has been thirty-five years since the late Christopher Reeve first soared across movie screens as the legendary Man of Steel.  But it doesn't really seem all that long ago, at least not when viewers first see Superman in costume at the Fortress of Solitude as he flies toward the camera and makes a remarkable banking turn in front of our eyes.  In my opinion, Reeve remains the only actor who can make one believe that Superman truly lives; it will forever be his legacy to moviegoers that a godlike super-hero could be fully realized as a personable human being that anyone could easily relate to.  Sure, the passage of time hasn't been kind to the film's badly outdated costumes, but, otherwise, ""Superman: The Movie"" still outclasses virtually any film in its genre.  It is pretty impressive that director Richard Donner and his production crew could conjure a totally believable Superman without the benefit of modern CGI and still make an appealing film for a wide spectrum of viewers.  Specifically, Donner's film proves that graphic violence, excessive profanity, and explicit content are not required for an entertaining movie experience.

With the classy opening sequence of a young boy flipping open an issue of ""Action Comics,"" as the camera then pans up into the sky towards the majestic darkness of deep space, composer John Williams' timeless theme sparks the imagination that something truly special is about to happen.  Director Richard Donner, with the aid of among others, script doctor Tom Mankiewicz, and an excellent ensemble cast, brings the ""Superman"" world to real life and establishes a common path for other big-budget super heroes Batman, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Avengers to follow by utilizing a first-class script and talented actors who are not ashamed to wear flashy spandex.

The film simplistically is a three-part play: the Krypton sequence (with Marlon Brando as Jor-El); Smallville (with Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent); and Metropolis (with Margot Kidder as Lois Lane; Jackie Cooper as Perry White; Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen; and, of course, Gene Hackman, as a delightfully sinister Lex Luthor).  New to the storyline are Lex's two groupies: bumbling Otis (Ned Beatty) and sultry Eve Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine), who help Hackman's egotistical Lex (as he calls himself, ""The greatest criminal mind of our time,"" and ""fiendishly gifted,"") add a wonderful element of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Case in point: watch an annoyed Lex's reaction to Otis having scribbled his own proposed little town (""Otisberg?,"" ""Otisberg?"") on to the scheming villain's idealized map of what California will look like after it is hit by a nuclear missile.  Also, Donner cleverly plants the seed for an inevitable sequel at the beginning rather than at the end with cameos by three Krypton super-villains (General Zod, Ursa, and Non).  By vowing that even Jor-El's heirs will one day kneel before him, the tyrannical Zod (Terrence Stamp) instantly becomes a classic movie villain ... with only a few moments of screen time.

Lastly, I will address the film's ending, as there is a legitimate cause for criticism.  After nearly two and a half hours of leisurely-paced, first class entertainment (including the breathtaking Superman & Lois ""first date"" flying sequence), the script resorts to a time travel gimmick to help resolve the finale.  Although originally intended for ""Superman II,"" as according to Donner, the idea makes Superman look unbeatable if he can alter history to his liking at will.  However, Reeve's anguished facial reactions make this plot twist work as viewers are reminded by voice-overs of Superman's past with his two fathers, and exactly why he chooses emotion over cosmic responsibility. The ending should be taken as a leap of faith that even the Man of Steel sometimes has to find a way to beat impossible odds.  Still, my favorite moment comes just before the closing credits with Superman's confident fly-by in space over Earth signaling that he will be back for further adventures ensuring our world is in safe hands.  Backed by the opening bars of Superman's theme, Reeve accomplishes a most satisfying farewell without saying a word.

Even today, whenever I ponder horrific tragedies reported by the news media, I still visualize Christopher Reeve's Superman flying out of seemingly nowhere to rescue Margot Kidder's Lois Lane from certain death dangling from a wrecked helicopter from the roof of the Daily Planet.  It reminds me that real-life heroism isn't a comic book; it is really about being there unselfishly when others are in need.

Rating: 10/10.  The blu-ray and DVD special features offer a treasure trove for fans, including music cues; screen tests; trailers; and some insightful documentaries, which are well worth your spare time.",1359936000,3,4804,5.163659793814433
607574,5,6303212263,"I have wanted this four disc collection of ""Superman:The Movie"" for a long time now and it finally came down to a price which I couldn't pass up. The film, of course, is a classic in every way and NO actor will ever play Superman/Clark Kent as well as Christopher Reeve did! The REAL treasure of this set are the documentaries, both some new and some original from 1978 about the making of the film. Also included are some original 1940's Superman animated shorts by Max Fleischer, the same guy who did the ""Popeye"" animated shorts as well as a Superman film starring George Reeves as Superman. These are really fun to watch for any true Superman fan! If I have a complaint about this set it is that it doesn't have a documentary about the MUSIC of Superman:The Movie by John Williams, arguably one of the best and most beloved of all Film Scores! I think that this oversight is unfortunate. The music that William's composed for the film became a PART of the Superman character and is now hard to imagine Superman WITHOUT John Williams' theme for him!

Jaws' mechanical shark, and the first Star Wars (before digital remastery). Superman's title sequence alone was very unusual for the day. And after 35 years, the film has held up pretty well, I think mostly thanks to Christopher Reeve's timeless performance and a score by John Williams. I suppose it didn't hurt having Marlon Brando appear in an eternal cameo. That alone will live long after the film (heck, they've already used the footage in later Superman films).

607649,5,6303212263,"While Superman fans will have to wait a few more months before the new films hits the screens, I recommend watching the original film that brought Superman out of the comics and into movies. With some exceptions, most movies (like Michael Bay's Transformers series) offer style over substance and we get lots of eye candy and no story, the 1978 Superman film offers both, while the special effects are dated but it can still be enjoyed as a modern movie made to look retro, plus it is fun to see all the fashion and hear all the slang from the 1970s.

Major spoiler (this movie has been out for years but if you haven't seen it..beware) the best part of the film is towards the end, Superman (Christopher Reeve) escapes capture from Lex Luthor and flies to stop the two missiles he launch in an attempt to destroy the west coast of California. Superman stops the first missile but the second hits the San Andreas fault line and Superman rushes to save the day, he repairs the fault line, saves children and prevents a mass flooding and after all his efforts, he senses something else wrong and scouts the area to find his lady love, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) dead, her car crushed and she suffocated after she was buried under rubble. Superman gently removes her from the car and after a moment of silence, he breaks down in anguish and flies up towards the sky.

Here is the most powerful scene, up in the sky he confronted by the memories of both of his fathers, Jor-El, his biological dad, chastises him that it is forbidden for him to interfere in human history. Jonathan Kent, Clark's adoptive father, a man who raised him, protected him and taught him the values of life on Earth reminds his son that he was brought to Earth for a reason and finally, Superman remembered his own limitations, despite all his abilities and powers, he couldn't save his adoptive father (Jonathan Kent died of a heart attack) and followed his heart, Superman bends the laws of space and time, turns back the clock long enough for him to save everybody from the devastation of Luthor's attack and humbly returns to look upon a now alive Lois in her car.

Superman: The Movie encapsulated every aspect of the character of Superman and his universe from the 40 years that he had existed at that time. The basic origin of Superman, his heritage and his battle of strength and wit against his arch-foe Lex Luthor are all explored here as well as his relationships with his supporting cast.

After watching this again, this is what a Superman movie should be, I'd give it more stars if I could. The movie opens up with John williams soaring iconic score, and then we come to Krypton, now the original intent was to film a massive Superman movie, kind of like what the salkynds had done with the three musketeers. They wanted it to be really campy too, but Dick donner ruined that, Now it's already been said about the behind the scenes arguing between Donner and the salkinds. Christopher Reeve as Superman, Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Now, he was cut out of Richard Lester's Superman II because the salkinds were cheap and didn't want to pay him, pure and simple. Now, for it being 1978, the effects of this movie stand up pretty well, and I'm sorry, but even the modern movies could take a lesson from this movie. Because I honestly believe that Superman is flying, and it's all done without CGI, the romance between Superman and Lois is believable. Now yes, Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor over the top. But to be fair, Lex Luthor wasn't the evil billionare in the comic books yet. Now some have complained about the whole turning the world back ending, I honestly didn't care. Because that's something that Superman is capable of doing, and it was supposed to be the ending to Superman II, but because the salkinds never told Donner that he was over budget. They wanted him to wrap up Superman The Movie, thus the ending was Taken from the second movie and put in the first.

Even with the barrage of great superhero movies that have come out over the past decade, 34-year-old ""Superman: The Movie"" remains one of the best.

As far as this Blu-Ray is concerned, however, I'm not very impressed. Compared to VHS and 90's television broadcasts, this offers a lot of improvements. Most notably would be the color corrections on ""flying"" shots, but these updates were already available on DVD. In this edition there is grain across the board, and the colors and contrast look highly compressed, as if they were intended for a medium-bandwidth broadcast. If you're watching on a projector like reviewer ""Achilles"", you might not notice the contrast issues, but anyone with a recent LCD or Plasma television is going to see grey blocks where there should be black as well as narrow color bands. The audio quality is also disappointing, especially with dialogue. Fuzzy and undefined, lacking the clarity of other 70's film transfers.

607729,4,6303212263,"Some years ago (let us never mind how many), I'd likely have given this one a full five stars. I still give the film four stars for its spirited sense of fun, for the visual splendor of its first half, and for the lead performances by Reeve, Kidder, and Hackman.

But would it be too cruel to admit that aspects of the film haven't aged as well as these aforementioned qualities? The epic, visual grandeur of Superman's first half - the sweeping fields of wheat, the open plains, the ice fields of Krypton - gives way to a more mundanely photographed, almost workmanlike view of Superman/Clark Kent's urban Metropolis.  This second half of the film just doesn't look as splendid as the first.

Add to that, the action in Metropolis is often dependent on special effects that appear badly dated. Now, the aging process on effects does not necessarily have to be a problem. To wit: the special effects of every film that Ray Harryhousen worked on appear dated, and yet his work is largely the reason people still watch `Jason and the Argonauts.'  The very artificiality of his effects seems to highlight the otherworldliness of the varying Greek gods and monsters.

Alas, where Harryhousen's work has aged well, the effects in `Superman' haven't.  The effects seem to have been designed to make Superman as believable - as realistic - as possible in the late 70's era. Thirty plus years later, however, special effects technology has moved on - and what was cutting edge then now appears... to be not.

However. With all of that said, the film still gets those four stars - for its sense of fun, and for its performances.

Reeve was so good as Superman that his performance has - in many minds - become the definitive interpretation. There's a fine, subtle humor to the way he plays the dual roles of Kent and Superman that accentuates his character's role as an outsider. Plus, Reeve looks good in the red and blue suit. No small task.

Margot Kidder remains my favorite Lois Lane. Smart, tough talking, driven, and prone to chain smoking, Kidder was able to carry out a difficult task: making Lane a believably smart reporter who could still miss the blatantly obvious fact that the hulking Iowa geek with glasses next to her is in fact the superhero with whom she's fallen in love. A lot of other actresses have taken on the role, some to very good effect (Neill and Hatcher), some not (Bosworth). None have quite matched Kidder's work here. (In my opinion, anyway...)

And then there's Hackman.  From what I can tell, not everyone likes his take on Lex Luthor - too much humor, not enough evil. If I'm being honest, I have to admit that Hackman doesn't really seem to be playing the part for dramatic effect. But darn, the man is funny - and I feel like his acting choices fit a film that places charm and wit above  a frenetic sense of drama. Plus, hey - it's Gene Hackman. I don't know about you, but I've never seen the man phone it in or give a bad performance - even when he's playing a light role. His effort is miles better than Kevin Spacey's rather dull, slightly sour take on the role.",1342310400,2,3097,4.5703971119133575

The world has changed in a lot of ways since the late seventies, particularly in its fashion sense - many civilians' getups are just as outlandish as Superman's - but despite his squeaky clean image and dated morals, there's still something familiar and relevant about this rendition of the big blue boy scout. He's naive to a fault, but there's no questioning his motivations and it's still refreshing to see a nice guy who doesn't finish last. Christopher Reeve is responsible for the majority of what works, and he buys into the role so completely that it's no surprise he'd be associated with the character for the rest of his life. Gene Hackman is disappointing in his first turn as Lex Luthor, but the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on and the script is impressive given its age. Although the much-maligned ending sequence is a total disaster, the rest of the story does a very good job of balancing a mature, serious tone with the lighter dalliances into fantasy that go hand-in-hand with the character.",1341878400,,1365,4.668049792531121

607805,4,6303212263,"Boy, how can I write an original review of ""Superman: The Movie""?  Just about everyone knows about this guy: where he's from, what he can do, what makes him tick.  If somehow you don't know, ""Superman: The Movie"" will spell it out for you. I guess the best I can do is focus upon how our love and need for ""Superheroes"" is stronger than our urge to insult them.

Of all the things in the world to satirize, you would think superheroes would be among the easiest.  Come on, vain, self-important, overconfident, naive jerks wearing colored underwear running around getting into trouble while fighting bad people and stopping bad things from happening (and all without getting paid)?  What a joke!  And yet, in my opinion, when movie directors take a satirical approach to a superhero movie, they usually turn out an unmemorable, unsuccessful product.  Why?  I think it's because, deep down, we want to believe in and respect superheroes and their admirably unselfish goal to make the world a better place.

This is why ""Superman: The Movie"" (hereafter STM) got it right.  Especially in our cynical times, it is sort of tempting to make merciless fun of a near-perfect demigod who really does care for all people and fights ceaselessly to protect them.  STM does not.  Yeah, it needles some aspects of the Superman mythos (e.g. telephone booths you can't fit into, Clark not even feeling the collision of a taxi that gets damaged, Lex Luthor's elaborate real estate plot, Lex Luthor's inept henchman Otis), but it does so with gentle kidding.  Instead, STM takes the time to introduce Superman from the beginning, from his origins on Krypton to his interactions with the Daily Planet staff and especially his offbeat romance with the flinty, independent Lois Lane.  We learn more about Superman than just the ""Super"" part - his wonderful powers, abilities, and weaknesses.  We learn about the ""man"" part too - his values, his objectives, his hopes, his fears,and his kind, courageous heart.

Superman has been called the ""Man of Steel"", but he has also been called ""The Man of Tomorrow"", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures.  I think STM acknowledges this, and hints that all the action, special effects, adventure, and battles of any superhero movie are meaningless unless we respect and believe in the ""S"" - not just Superman, but also the ""S"" we all potentially have underneath.",1334793600,2,2465,4.844868735083533

I do enjoy over and over the cartoon episodes from the 1940s, which have great quality artwork and action-packed plots. Of course, they follow the same plot structure: Lois Lane gets in trouble and Superman saves her, but each episode is fun to watch, and they are in good condition.

607810,5,6303212263,"I know my review's title is rather bold and might be subject to debate. However, I can't see how.

Sure, these kinds of movies are made nowadays with such huge budgets and more eye dazzling special effects....but they all lack the sincerity and wonder of Richard Donner's 1978 masterpiece.

Let's face it. Donner approached this film with almost a religious reverence. In his own words, Superman is ""Americana"". He could easily have done this in a campy fashion with a tongue rooted firmly in cheek, as was the Batman series a decade earlier. Instead, he decided to make it epic in scope and a sincere tribute to the archetype of super powered heroes. Given the time this film was made and released (the turbulent 70s), it could have lent itself to being ""hokey"" or ""sappy""...but it wasn't. It was a breath of fresh air and, like Star Wars the previous year, was a milestone in cinematic special effects. Sure, you could look at it now and say ""so what"", but back in 1978, I could have SWORN Chris Reeve was flying. In my mind, it still looks ten times better than the CGI drivel that pollutes the genre now.

Christopher Reeve is the only person who could have done this role justice. I can't imagine another actor doing a better job. They tried with a Reeve clone in the abysmal Superman Returns (although...I will say Routh was the best thing about that movie). Cavill looks good in recent pics I've seen....but I am reserving judgment until the Snyder film comes out next year.

From the grandeur of the opening credits (still gives me shivers every time I watch) to the final pass over Earth as the sun rises and Reeve smiles at the audience, as if to be winking to the viewer and saying ""try not to enjoy yourself...I DARE you""....It is the epitome of what this kind of film should be. Superhero flicks are so cookie cutter in 2012 that the studios crank at least a dozen or more of them every year. When this was released, it was the first of it's kind and truly an event.

I will swear to my dying day....there hasn't been a film based on a comic book character since that could touch this one. It's the standard by which I judge superhero films on...and it still hasn't been matched. Nolan's Batman films came close...but they lacked the wonder and grandeur because he spent too much time trying to base everything in REALITY.

There's too much reality to deal with every day....Superman takes me away and I am flying right there with him. 34 years later....I'm still enjoying the flight.

Thanks Mr. Donner....and rest well Mr. Reeve. My childhood owes a debt I could never repay.",1329264000,7,2590,4.5809935205183585
607811,5,6303212263,"recently watched this filmed again- it has likely been at least 25 years since the last viewing (I was young then, not so young now).

What I really like was the ""tone"" of the film.  What I mean is the emotional depth that the audience has in connecting with the characters.  For that, credit goes to director Richard Donner.  The film is mostly a drama, with light comedic touches.  It has a real nostalgic feel to it.

brief plot:  Superman loses his parents in a far distant apocolyptic world, more advanced than Earth.  Thanks to a recording device imbedded in his satellite, Superman learns about his origin and his future purpose.  Once on Earth as he grows physically, he faces alienation as he tries to cope with ""fitting in"" with his peers- all the while harboring the secrets of his super powers.

By becoming his super alter-ego, he can use his powers for good, and feel validated in ways that his Clark Kent persona cannot.  Thus, psychologically, Superman provides Clark Kent with ego balance, making him a whole and complete person.

One of the best aspects of the film is the casting.  We've got Marlon Brando (Oscar winner), Gene Hackman (Oscar winner), then new-comer Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder as the main players.  The casting was just perfect.  I can't imagine Superman being anyone else than Chris Reeve.  I can't imagine Lex Luthor being anyone else than Gene Hackman, and I can't imagine Lois Lane being anyone else than Margot Kidder.

The other great piece of the film is the script.  Intelligent, inspiring, touching, adventurous, and most of all, believable.  Everyone has some ""good lines"" in this film, memorable lines, which to me is a sign of a good script.

607848,5,6303212263,"This DVD set contains Superman I ONLY but also includes a lot of feature stuff that definitely enhances the film and the actors. For example, the selection of a Superman and of Lois Lane is detailed. After explaining the casting decisions, the process is understood as not so easily accomplished.

This film is the story of Superman (Christopher Reeves), from his mother and father's life on Crypton, to growing up as a man on planet Earth, to finally functioning as the super hero we all know. The mild sided Clark Kent works as a newspaperman, providing the opportunity to hear crime news. He meets Lois Lane but has more and more difficulty keeping the identity secret. Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) appears as the super villain and fences off in a spectacular showdown with Superman.

In the features, Gene Hackman applauds Christopher Reeves for the decision to take on the role. Once typecast, Mr. Reeves would find it difficult to shake. Many humorous cuts are shown (not seen in the film) with Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeves. This gives the viewer insight into the actors.

Similarly, many fine actresses were tried for the part of Lois Lane without success. It's interesting to discover oneself in the part of the casting director searching for the qualities needed in the discovery process.

607849,5,6303212263,"There have been remakes that have stood up to their original sources. Scarface is one that comes to Mind. The 10 Commandments. Lolita to name a few. Then there are some films that are so legendary, so iconic, that to even suggest remaking them verges on sacrilege. The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Scarface, Citizen Kane, etc. I'd put the original Superman in this group. I think there are roles that certain actors were born to play, that they completely and positively own, that are them and, to this moviephile, Christopher Reeves didn't play Superman, he WAS and still IS Superman and any 3D cgi reincarnation of the role is doomed to invite comparisons to Reeves and will fall miserably short.

For anyone whose been in a coma the past 30 or so years, the film lays out the origin of the son of Krypton, his escape from his own dying planet to Earth where he's raised by his adoptive parents as Clark Kent, his awakening to his powers and his destiny, and his role conflict expressed through his infatuation of a female colleague at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane, and his greater responsibility to protect the human race. Reeves perfectly embodies the contradiction of his two personas. As Clark Kent, reporter at the Daily Planet, he's modest, unassuming, weak (he needs glasses to see properly), and he, like everyone else, envies his alter ego who's the complete opposite. But even so, when you see Clark, the wholesome farmboy who sends half his check to his elderly mother, you see Superman and vise versa. Clark embodies what all of us, who've been blessed with superior abilities should be like: humble, generous, deflecting praise, using our powers to help others--Reeves embodied this principle and wasn't just another pretty boy with muscles. I don't think anyone else has or can pull off the Man of Steel with the same charisma and charm and life Reeves channeled into this character. When the Dark Knight dropped, I jumped the gun like everyone else and said that it was the best superhero movie ever made. But then I remembered this wonderful magical film and its star Reeves, Margot Kidder (hang in there, babe), Gene Hackman, John William's rousing score, and I quickly revised my ranking of the Dark Knight: it is the 3rd best superhero film ever made. This film, Superman, and its sequel, are the best Superhero films ever made thanks to a man who was even more of a Superman in real life. Rip, Chris.",1319673600,2,2419,4.7595238095238095

There's no need for me to go on here about how fantastic the movie is, or how perfectly cast and iconic Christopher Reeve is. ""Superman: The Movie"" (and by extension Richard Donner's Director's Cut of ""Superman II) remains the yardstick by which all other modern Superhero movies must be judged.
  This four DVD edition includes two versions of ""The Movie"" itself: The 1978 original Theatrical Release and the slightly Expanded Edition from 2000. I find myself watching the Expanded Edition exclusively, although both versions are fine. DVDS 3 and 4 are loaded with Special Features, including three documentaries.  ""The Development Of Superman"" and ""Filming The Legend"" offer insightful details into the exhausting eighteen month schedule required to shoot two films at once. Most upsetting is  how the Salkind producers fired director Richard Donner after the release of ""Superman"" but before he could complete ""Superman II."" This is upsetting because it is so evident now that much of the film's timeless magic and appeal comes from Donner's energy, enthusiasm, and complete dedication (and Christopher Reeve's humanity).  A rough justice, of sorts, was served with the DVD release of ""Superman II: Richard Donner's Director's Cut.""

Rarely is the casting of a movie perfect, such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman. Mr. Reeve's performance as directed by Richard Donner is perfect, as is the work by the cast of both well-known and not as well-known actors. My only complaint in an otherwise near flawless movie would be near the end when after the nuclear missle hits the San Andreas fault and Superman tries to restore all the earthquake damage, he goes to Hoover Dam and just after the dam shatters and water pours out, he shoves boulders into the way of the flooding water. The problem is that its quite obvious that the town he saves is a miniature probably built from model kits from a model railroading store. With all the money spent on the movie, couldn't they have done better with this sequence? But overall, I see Superman--The Movie as one of the great love stories in the movies. In order to save the woman he loves, he disobeys his Prime Directive of never altering the course of human destiny and reverses time to save her! How many of us wouldn't want to do that?

These shorts have extensive art-deco detail and move at a breakneck pace--just action, action, action! Also included in the disc set was ""Superman and the Mole-Men"" (1951). It starred the t.v. Superman of the time, George Reeves, and is (for the budget they had to work with) very good. My only complaint being that even though most of the story takes place at night, the exterior scenes are far too well lit to effectively be considered as being ""night"" unless the story took place in the high northern latitudes where the midnight sun would illuminate the sky.
  Included in the disc set are deleted scenes from Superman--The Movie, and as is the case for many deleted scenes in movies, it's easy to see why they weren't included in the final cut of the movie.",1289088000,3,2104,4.558201058201059

Director Richard Donner's 1978 film ""Superman - The Movie"" is an amazing accomplishment.  Starring Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando it redefined the approach to comic book treatment and media.  It is the genesis of the mature comic book movie, a phenomenon we are still enjoying today.

It tells the classic ""Superman"" origin story, and wisely takes its time to humanize the character.  Superman himself doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the movie, and the viewer does not feel cheated at all.  Instead, the movie spends time on both Krypton and Earth establishing Clark Kent at different phases of his life.  Acting luminaries Marlon Brando and Susannah York play Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara very well. As the movie shifts to young Clark's rural home of Smallville, his Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent are capably played by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter.  When he does eventually turn up, Christopher Reeve is magnificent in the dual role of the mature Clark Kent and Superman, effortlessly capturing the differences between the characters and embodying each character perfectly.  He is supported by Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, the role for which the actress is probably still best known.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is humorous, but not without a very hard edge.

This DVD edition is the first release to feature significant previously unseen footage(although a minor deleted shot of Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude was in original U.S. movie trailers).  The alterations are mostly more of Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude.  Overall, it's a fuller, more satisfying release than previously available.

Also featuring a brilliant orchestral score from John Williams and a versatile screenplay co-written by Mario Puzo(""The Godfather""), ""Superman - The Movie"" is a classic.

P.S.  It is specifically called 'The Movie' because the concept of a mature superhero movie was new, and the label was used to stress to audiences of the time that it was a serious movie.",1284163200,,2073,5.217522658610272

607968,5,6303212263,"Now, before I get to assessing the Blu ray version of ""Superman - The Movie, I want to give my overall critique of the film itself.

Pardon me, it may take a while, lol:

I LOVE THIS MOVIE----With A Passion. Ive loved it every since I was that 6 yr old kid sitting in that dark movie theatre in late 1978 with my older brother, oohing and aweing at the images, amazed that I was seeing actors and filmmakers bringing one of my all-time favorite comic book superheroes to VIVID LIFE. I seen it perhaps more times than the Earth has revolved around the sun or Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson have won Grammys, lol. It's magnificent entertainment. Pure and simple. From a time when film craftsmen actually cared about their film subject and gave their audience something to be proud to spend their money on.

Director Richard Donner and producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind took a great American character and built a full scale old style Hollywood epic around him. Donner has stated over the yrs he wanted realism...nothing more, nothing less. If the filmmakers couldn't believe wholeheartedly in Superman and his world, why would we? Makes sense. It has heart, humor, a few strong dramatic moments, a few sad moments....a lot like the real world.

First, we see the planet Krypton in all its majesty....cold, sterile, highly advanced. Then, we go to Earth as baby Kal-El is sent by rocketship there after Krypton's destruction. We watch him grow up under the watchful eyes of his adoptive parents, the Kents. Then, after he learns his true heritage and his destiny, we follow him to Metropolis, where hes now Clark Kent, news reporter, and our world's all mighty protector, Superman. Simple storytelling yet so powerfully told on screen.

This is one adventure film thats so well cast its scary; the actors are so committed to their characters, theres not ONE FALSE MOVE, from anyone: Marlon Brando, dignified as Superman's Kryptonian father, Jor-El; Gene Hackman brings excellent comic relief as the villianous Lex Luthor; Margot Kidder is a sexy yet strong and intelligent Lois Lane (is there any other kind?); Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter are the definitive Jonathan and Martha Kent; Ned Beatty is a funny Otis the hapless henchmen; Valerie Perrine is sex and playfulness as Luthors femme fatale, Miss Teschmacher.

However, you cant have a Superman film with the title character himself, and the late Christopher Reeve IS and ALWAYS will be the ULTIMATE Man of Steel. Reeves interpretation of the hero is so definitive, so realistic, so intelligent, that in the hands of any other actor, it mightve come off as phony and a caricature. It wouldve been a tragic mistake. Reeve deftly handles the duality of Superman/Kent. His Kent, supposedly modeled after Cary Grant, is a sweet yet fumbling everyman....his Superman, on the other hand, is majestic, bold, with a bit of a swagger that doesnt make him look too arrogant and a dash of upright DO-GOODER AT YOUR SERVICE....Perfection. He inhabits these two individual personalities so completely that although we all know its the same man, he makes them look like two separate entities. Why Reeve wasn't considered for Oscar consideration has always baffled me over the years.

Everything, from the script to the set designs; from the cinematography to the Academy Award winning visual effects to the grand, inspiring score (one of my truly favorite pieces of music, ever)  by the great John Williams, is flawless. Attention to detail is part of what makes or breaks any film and ""Superman"" has it in spades. Nothing seems out of sync and the affection for the material is infectious. Even those who either never read a comic book or hadnt read Superman in yrs loved this movie. Watching it is fun and it sweeps you in, like the best adventure stories are supposed to.

Now.....the presentation on Blu ray. I own this classic on VHS, the 2000 special Edition DVD and the four disc 2006 Special Edition DVD, and ive never had a problem in my viewing of it, especially in the digital format, where ""Superman"" shines. Having just seen it on Blu ray for the first time in that format the other night i can say the picture and audio quality are very well rendered; the colors and details are very vivid and the audio, while no different from in other digital presentations, is clear in the 5.1 Dolby capacity.",1277942400,4,4357,4.83758389261745

608026,4,6303212263,"Heck, this 1978 version of SUPERMAN was nostalgic even when it originally was released.  Featuring the likes of Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Glenn Ford, and Susannah York, the film instantly became a Who's Who of established screen heavyweights.  And you can never, ever, go wrong with Gene Hackman as the villain; his Lex Luther character could very well be the best known--and best loved--bad guy in cinematic history.

Yet--despite its numerous cornball supreme moments that still have me grimacing--the best thing SUPERMAN has going for it is charm.  This is a gloriously charming film, from its visuals of rolling wheat fields in Kansas, to its (at the time) state-of-the-art special effects--to its ever-respectful homage to its TV series predecessor.  Christopher Reeve plays the Man of Steel with humility, grace, and yes, humanity (Krypton or no Krypton).  Reeve turned out to be a home run for director Richard Donner.  Alas, Margot Kidder is just plain annoying as an aggressive, overbearing, man-eating Lois Lane, but she's merely an irritant that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.

SUPERMAN is a light, fun, and entertaining movie--a lusciously glorious dose of good vibes nostalgia.

I want to see movies the way I did at the theater not the way they think I should see it now.

Well, I just watched this Blu-Ray version of ""Superman: The Movie"", and then watched my old DVD of this film.  I'll have to say that buying the Blu-Ray disc of this movie proved to be a waste of money.  The Blu-Ray disc looks no better than the DVD.  In fact, I'll even say that the DVD had it's colors more in check than this Blu-Ray disc did.  On Blu-Ray, the flesh tones were rather too pink where on regular DVD, everyone's flesh tones looked more natural.  So, for this being my first Blu-Ray disc to watch and compare, I'm rather disappointed, but then again, greatly relieved.

608073,1,6303212263,"I am simply astounded by the popularity of this terrible film. One would imagine that one of the most popular superhero films ever made would at least be entertaining in a base kind of way, but this film fails in nearly every way. The script is the worst I have ever seen. The Superman universe's fictional laws are constantly contradicted and broken when it fits the director's whim.

The dialogue and acting are atrocious. All of the actors (and it stars people like Reeves and Hackman, who are both very good actors) portray their roles with a kind of smirky self-consciousness, as if to underscore the ridiculousness of the production. The dialogue is an endless stream of boorish cliches, from start to finish. This particular quality (the low quality of the dialogue) is overpowering in two sequences: the opening scene on Krypton, and the the bit which was probably intended as romantic where Superman and Lois Lane go flying around the city. The latter is worse. Lane's voiceover seems like a distillation of the worst elements of dialogue in Harlequin romances, purified to their rotten, insipid core. Dialogue this bad shouldn't exist.

The film is unaware of whether it wants to be good campy fun or a serious work of cinema. It tries to be both, and fails to be either. The campy plot, dialogue, and acting serve to undermine the seriousness inherent in several of the film's attempts at poignancy. And, likewise, the seriousness undermines the film's campiness.

This is the worst kind of film: that which requires its characters to act stupid or incomprehensible in order to drive the drama. It goes all out. Characters act randomly, with no explanation as to why they are doing what they are doing.. Villains talk about how Superman cannot be harmed by bullets or fire... and then proceed to attack him with bullets and fire. Luthor (who boasts about having an IQ of 200) describes his plot in great detail to Superman, and then leaves him in the same room as a woman who has just expressed horror at his (Luthor's) plans. Clark Kent states that he must leave the home of his mother, without ever expressing why he must to the audience: we (and his mother, evidently) are expected to infer this information.

What makes this film so offensive, however, isn't the poor acting, dialogue, characters, or plot (this is, after all, a SUPERMAN movie - you can only go so far with the material), but the fact that the script disregards basic rules of narrative construction, contradicting logic and this world's fictional rules when it sees fit to do so. At one moment, Superman must change in a phone booth in order to rescue Lois Lane. During another, he can magically change what he is wearing in order to address a threat by Luthor. Moreover, Superman can not only reverse time by spinning the Earth backward on its axis (a dubious notion to begin with), but can select which aspects of the past he'd like to change.

This film was primarily a spectacle of Special Effects when it was released. It has suffered the fate all such films must: its techniques are now exceedingly phony looking, and when the graphical prettiness is no longer an element, the film collapses.

I am neither given to misanthropy nor to elitism, but I must question the collective sanity of the people of this world when such a lazy film as this is so widely loved to this day.",1254441600,9,3364,4.7320819112627985
608074,5,6303212263,"With the exception of George Reeves from the television series, no one has ever cleary defined a role as greatly as Christopher Reeve (for four films no less)! Until Burton's Batman film 11 years later and more recently The Dark Knight, there has never been an epic superhero film like this. It combines great talent (in front and behind the cameras), great story (with very subtle Biblical references) and amazing special effects. The only aspect of Reeve I don't like (and its probably because of the way the writers wanted) is the portrayal of Clark Kent. I don't like that he portrays him as a bumbling fool. As Superman, he's sincere and honest but the recent animated versions and Reeves' portrayed him as a reporter who can get story and not get intimidated by criminals as easily as these movies (including Returns). Margot Kidder is feisty as Lois Lane (and believeable too, not like Bosworth who looks like she's at the Daily Planet on an internship). Gene Hackman is both lethal and funny as Luthor, able to mix the cruelness of the villain along with the wittiness in his insults to his underlings. The flying sequences are brilliantly done (and continue to get better, until 4 (they liked to use the same shot over and over) and Returns (where almost everything looks CGI, even in the shots that really are Routh, he looks computer generated). The incomprable John Williams again delivers a rousing score. His main theme and the love theme are ones not to be missed.",1250726400,2,1479,4.7587548638132295
608075,5,6303212263,"The movie:

""You'll believe a man can fly."" That was the advertising tagline. Well, I can't think of many instances of it, but this was one time when a movie delivered on its hype. ""Superman"" fires on many cylinders, but the main one, the integral one, was believability. This film is an absolute achievement in terms of tone, style, and effects. For 1978, the effects are terrific, but also the performances and the writing really gel and sell the concept to the audience.

We haven't seen yet the actor who can top Christopher Reeve's Superman. The solidness, the goodness radiating from his presence in costume, combined with the vulnerability and sheer hilarity of his Clark Kent are (perhaps) impossible to top. Margot Kidder turns in a feisty Lois Lane, and their chemistry is great. Gene Hackman is a credible Lex Luthor, both funny and menacing at the same time. Supporting players fill out a cast that just really inhabits the world and never feels less than real.

The run time of the movie is perhaps a bit flabby, and this edition adds about 3 minute of new material. But I for one am quick to forgive it - it just so captures a feeling of innocence, wonder, Americana, that I'm willing to just bask in it, even when the action slows down.

The Blu-Ray:

Well, this is not one of the discs you'll pop in to show off ""how great HD looks."" The film was shot almost throughout with soft focus filters which bump up the haze of lighting and obscure detail.

BUT: It looks as good as it probably ever can and ever will. In A-B comparisons with the previous DVD (which was great for its day) the upgrade is subtle but evident. Some shots show very strong detail, when it's in focus. Check out the foliage in Lois' rooftop apartment. Some facial shots show exceptional detail in fine lines. Whenever the soft filter is absent, you can really tell you're watching an HD presentation. The colors are the main upgrade in the Blu-Ray - reds and blues really pop, and black levels are rock solid in most shots not involving visual effects. Film grain is present and generally not too obtrusive, except during some effects shots. But I prefer its presence to excessive digital noise reduction. In the end, how you feel about this Blu-Ray will depend on your emotions for the film itself (mine are very strongly positive), and how you feel about a home video accurately replicating the look and feel of the original presentation's film stock (something I'm also strongly in favor of).

Audio is presented in a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix. There isn't much of a workout for the surrounds, but John Williams' iconic score really sings, nonetheless.

Extras include an hour's worth of documentaries, reprises from the DVD edition. Casting tests, trailers, a commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, and a wonderful score only track highlighting the music, round out the disc. Overall, at least average and probably slightly above average.

**********

I grew up with this film. I'm predisposed to enjoying it. As a Blu-Ray, it is hampered by the stylistic choices of the filmmakers, but still gives us a very good presentation of the film.

It's a five star film in my book. It's certainly in the top 5 comic book movies ever made (and was the true pioneer in terms of big budget successes from comic book material.) I considered downgrading this disc by one star simply because it can't overcome the flaws inherent to the source material. For the paltry sum Amazon is asking for it, you really can't go wrong, though. Kids of all ages (ages 3 to 83?) who just want to feel good about the world will be transported to a better, simpler, more beautiful place. Fans of 1970's cinema will find a lot to love, as well. There are many shots which really shine in detail, and almost all of the shots benefit from zippier colors. If you don't own this film otherwise, or are just a fan of the action/comic book genre, this is a must-buy. It's a classic.",1243209600,35,3958,4.656160458452722
608136,5,6303212263,"Man, time flies........not just Superman.  I say that because I vividly remember when this movie came out in the theater and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, and I on the big screen, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.  Now,

It's still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as ""Lex Luthor"") and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular ""Man Of Steel"" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this, too.

Personally, I never cared for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with the territory.  However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence it was just too weird watching this movie and  hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!  (The purity of the  `50s is lone gone!)

Whatever, this is still great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.",1241136000,,1297,4.604347826086957
608137,5,6303212263,"This comic book movie is great. It brings a good start on the Superman series. It shows the origins of Superman. The planet Krypton was destroyed by a supernova. Before the planet's destruction, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sends his infant son Kal-El to Earth to ensure the survival of the Kryptopian race. The asteroid with him in it landed on Earth three years later, on the farm town Smallville, where he was found by George and Martha Kent, who raised his as Clark Kent. When he turned 18, he discovers his powers, George dies of a heart attack and Clark left Smallville for Metropolis. On the way, he threw a Kryptopian Crystal into the water of the arctic and formed the Fortress of Solitude, where he discovers his true idenity. He trained and developed his powers for eight years and donned the mantle of Superman (Christopher Reeve). He arrived at Metropolis and got a job at the Daily Planet newspaper business, where he met Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Unknown to them, a criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) begins a sinister plot as we speak.

  This was a neat flick to check out. Christopher Reeve fitted the part really well. The visual effects were stunning. The action was neat, as well. This was the best of the original anthology. The second film's theatrical version was also pretty good, but campier than this one. I heard the third and fourth ones suck eggs. It would be 2006 when the second film's Richard Donner Cut and Superman Returns would be a great comeback in the series with Returns being the best in the franchise. They were also dedicated in memory of Reeve as well. The first is still a classic worth seeing.",1240617600,,1645,4.685121107266436
608138,5,6303212263,"There were super-hero movies before 1978's Superman, and some of them were pretty ok. Heck, there were even a couple Superman films. None were great. There's been many others since, some of which were pretty ok, some were great, and at least one (The Dark Knight), has completely changed the genre.

But the first real genre changer was Superman.

The plot for the film is somewhat minimalistic, centering around a first act introducing our character, a second act showing him in Metropolis and a third act thwarting Lex Luthor's evil scheme to... er... get real estate. Ahem. Apparently taking Ted Turner's methods and simply buying most of Wyoming didn't appeal.

Needless to say in the real world his plan to drop California into the ocean and create water front property from desert would not work (dropping a nuke on the San Andreas fault would inconvenience anyone nearby for a nanosecond, but it wouldn't start an earthquake. Continental plates are huge). But really, the plot is secondary to the characters, and as embodied by actors such as Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, the characters really come alive, especially Superman/Clark Kent, played by then-unknown actor Christopher Reeve.

What can be said about Reeve's performance? In many ways it makes the film. He's entirely convincing as both Superman and Clark Kent. It's hard to be convincing as the hero and the secret identity, as learned by, for example, Brandon Routh in the disastrous Superman Returns, and along with Christian Bale and Toby McGuire, Reeve is one of the few to find the balance needed to play both. Reeve's performance in the film was in fact so iconic that DC Comics began to draw Superman to look more like Christopher Reeve and even now, over a generation since the film came out, Reeve is, and will always be, Superman to many people.

The performance is far from the only iconic thing about the film. Remember John Williams' score for the movie? I bet you do. I bet right now the theme is playing through your head. So popular was that music that it was reused for Superman Returns, giving the film at least a few good points amongst the dross. Heck, much as I'm not big on the ""can you read my mind?"" song, I gotta admit, it sticks with you.

The screenplay is also quite sharp and entertaining. To this day if you're around a certain sort of person and say, ""Don't worry; I've got you,"" they'll say back, ""You've got me? Who's got you?!"" It's also fun to see the level of cynicism displayed by the various people at the Daily Planet over this big, flying Boy Scout. The movie was made in the late 1970's, after all, and the attitudes reflect that.

The tagline for the movie was ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly"", and you know what? That's pretty damn accurate. The flying effects hold up well even though, though some of the other effects suffer. Now it's quite common to see people on screen flying all over the place, but this was the first movie to really do justice to human flight.

The film is not without flaws. As I mentioned, the plot is paper thin, but it gets the job done, and Ned Beatty's character is a needless distraction. Despite that, it's a movie I still watch and enjoy from time-to-time, remembering when I was a little boy, amazed at seeing that a man could fly.",1240099200,,3276,4.655709342560554
608139,4,6303212263,"I was lucky enough to have seen Superman in the theatres when I was a child back in the 70s, and the sense of wonder it evoked in me then is renewed every time I watch it as an adult. Its epic grandeur, its sense of gravitas, has never been equaled by any other superhero movie (I mean, Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Gene Hackman, Mario Puzo, all screen legends of the time for a film based on comics? What were they thinking!). Christopher Reeve is the quintessential Superman, incredibly handsome, incredibly wholesome and good-natured, and his heroism on screen is all the more poignant in the light of what happened to him in real life. I still think that the CAN YOU READ MY MIND night-flying sequence is among the most romantic scenes in all cinema. This blu-ray version is beautiful. If you're looking for the sharpness of IRONMAN or BATMAN BEGINS on blu-ray, you will be disappointed. Much of the film is shot in a soft-glow style, and this look has been preserved in the blu-ray transfer. The Krypton sequences seem to take place behind a veil of haze, which might be frustrating for those of us used to the crystal-clear images of hi-def. But the Smallville sequences are  beautifully awash in golden sunlight and lush colours and the sharp outlines of prairie houses. They could have made the whole film sharper and clearer in the transfer, but this would have altered the sweeping, romantic, film-like feel of the cinematography. What you get here is better colour saturation. It's a pity that the studio did not offer the latest Dolby True-HD or DTS-HD Master Audio sound format; but the Dolby 5.1 sound here  still soars (John William's magnificent score is itself worth the price of admission). Compared to the earlier DVD edition, the channel separation in this blu-ray is more pronounced; towards the end when Jor-El warns Superman against tampering with history, check out how impressively his disembodied voice scans across all 5 speakers.  If you never had the chance to catch Superman in the theatres--or if you simply want to relive that experience-- the next best thing is to get this blu-ray and watch it in a darkened room at home on a large projector screen with surround speakers. (5 stars for movie, 4 stars for the blu-ray).",1238371200,12,2265,4.7729591836734695

The problem with most superhero movies is they have a lead character that is quite muscle-bound and finding such an actor that can also act is not a common phenomenon.  Enter Christopher Reeves, who had both the physique and talent and you have history in the making - the first comic book movie without the camp.  Add in Margot Kidder, who I believe is the best Lois Lane, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando and writers from the Godfather and you have an epic, epic movie.  The only thing negative that can possibly be said of this film is its special effects which is somewhat dated  but still hold up quite nicely minus some Superman flying scenes that appear somewhat fake.

Christopher Reeve does an outstanding job playing Clark Kent/Superman.  It is disgraceful he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.  Gene Hackman too shines bright as do, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, Marlon Brando, Marc McClure, etc.

The special effects still hold up and are still breath taking when seen.  No wonder they won an Academy Award for Visual Effects.

Under the direction of Richard Donner, Superman flies not only on film, but in our imaginations. This is not the first attempt at a live-action Superman, and it is far from the last, but with a lot of work, it was the first realistic portrayal of the man of steel's powers. They knew going in that sub-par effects work would kill the magic of this movie, which is why they spent more R&D on making Superman fly than on any other single element of the movie. In the end, the tag line in the advertising boiled it down succinctly: You will believe a man can fly.

Superman speaks to the most basic part of the human imagination. He is what we all wish we could be, both in body and in spirit. He is perfectly good as well as perfectly formed. But if we couldn't believe in his powers, we would never be able to be pulled completely into the fantasy.

A perfect hero, however, requires a perfect villain. Gene Hackman brings the right amount of charisma to the cruel and villainous Lex Luthor.

I'm not complaining about the movie itself, just the quality of this BD and what it could have been.
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want Lucas to come in and ""enhance"" the original film, or anything like that, just clean it up a little before you put it in the high definition category!
This is especially noticeable in the Krypton scenes early in the movie.  On my 1080i 55"" screen, it looked like someone put pepper all over the shots.  The pristine landscape that they were trying for was noticeably bad, and I was left scratching my head wondering ""what were they thinking?""
Did any of the powers that be actually watch this on a decent sized screen before releasing it, or did they figure Superman fans would snatch it up without really paying attention to it.  I admit, and have said before that it's a 30 year old film, so the quality of the original will reflect the quality of the transfer, but this is an unacceptable release.  From one Superman fan to another, please avoid this release, and hope with me that there will be a better one down the line.
There are good points to this release, the sound and music are fantastic, and it appears to be mixed very well, but you can get that from the standard definition DVD for about half the price.  Commentary track (I believe) is from the special edition DVD, and you can also get the music only track to listen to some John Williams genius at work.

PQ is above average with some grain in the opening scenes on the planet Krypton, but that ends once back on Earth. Colors are magnificent and Superman's suit is a sight to behold. Check out those cool red boots! There are a few added scenes that I have never seen before and they really helped to augment the story a bit. Super Genius Lex Luthor adds a touch of Dr. Evil as he surrounds himself with Fricken Idiots and a lot of comedy in these scenarios. This movie has it all. Its funny, serious, nostalgic and above all, a wonderful adventure!",1192147200,4,1065,4.438775510204081

The movie is a classic, it hasn't aged at all and it is never boring (no matter how many times I watch it). The cast is perfect for the story and the story itself is excellent. There is just a really great scene towards the end of the movie when Superman gets really angry. You can literally feel the rage coming off the screen.

There are just so many special effects in this movie that are simply breath-taking, especially if you compare it to the films of the same year and decade. Just the ability to make Superman fly was an amazing stunt, but there are so many other things in the film that are equally cool. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the helicopter scene, then there is the scene when Superman goes through the Earth's core and just the special effects used during Lex Luthor's test of Superman. It is just cool to see the bullets bounce off of the Man of Steel.

608360,3,6303212263,"I've never really been that fussed about seeing this film before - as a child (OK, and now) I was mad about Lois & Clark: New Adventures Of Superman, with Dean Cain & Teri Hatcher, and am now collecting the DVDs. (I've never seen Smallville yet - probably not a good idea to get started on that one, I've still got loads of others to watch.) People have always said, the first actor you see playing a certain role, will never compare to anyone else. Up until now, I didn't think anyone but Dean Cain could play Superman.

How wrong I was. After watching this film (and buying Superman II and Superman Returns), I have to say I love Christopher Reeve as Superman. Not only does he fill the suit rather well, he's hotter than Dean Cain (can't believe I once spent a ""Bring Your Daughter To Work Day"" trawling the internet at my Dad's work looking for photos of him!), and he brings a whole new dimension to the character of Clark Kent. With Dean, he was just a guy in glasses, with almost exactly the same hair. Christopher turns Clark into a bumbling idiot, who seems to be out of sorts with everything around him, and parts his hair on a different side, whether he's Clark or Superman.

I certainly hope the second movie starts with more of a bang than this one did. Just over an hour before we actually get to see Christopher as Superman. I hated the beginning, and really was going to switch it off, but thankfully, I didn't. It was just way too much, and what Marlon Brando got paid was absolutely shocking. He got paid $3.7 million, and as if that wasn't enough, he also got a percentage of the profits for playing Jor-El for 12 (TWELVE) shooting days. The fee (plus the percentage) also covered the sequel, which was being simultaneously shot with the original. He didn't appear in the sequel however, as he was involved in a lawsuit over non-payment of his profit-participation for the original movie. He ultimately received about $14 million for his ten minutes on film. ($14 MILLION).

I wasn't keen on Margot Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane. I loved Teri Hatcher's version of the character, but wasn't so keen on this one. She seemed to scream at every opportunity, and certainly played the traditional damsel in distress character, which was very grating. Teri certainly didn't do that - she gave Lois Lane (to put it politely) balls, who didn't need a guy in tights to save her.

The film was excellent, and I was shocked at the quality of the CGI, during the flying sequences - but in a good way. I seriously expected the CGI to be worse than it was, particularly for a film made in 1978. I only noticed the CGI a couple of times, but I've seen it a lot worse in other films. I was very impressed, as I was expecting to notice it a lot.

Christopher Reeve certainly had talent, and it showed in this. He's so hot too! It's such a shame what has happened since, and it still makes me sad thinking about it. In my opinion, he's definitely the best Superman, and I doubt that will change when I watch Superman Returns. (Although Brandon Routh could have been his twin, they look pretty similar!)

Overall, I was really impressed with this film, although I think it could have been better in parts, but Christopher's performance more than makes up for that. I look forward to seeing the second, and then I might make a decision about the third & fourth. But then again, I might just buy it for Christopher. He's definitely hot. Even if he does wear tights, and his underwear on the outside.",1183420800,,3503,4.482758620689655

608362,2,6303212263,"Be warned, Jor-el -- I am a ""Superman: The Movie"" purest to the Nth degree (I saw the original in its first theatrical run three times in 1978 and many, many more times on videotape).

NOTE: If you thought ""Superman Returns"" was a better film than ""The Movie"", you may as well stop reading this review right here and now. There isn't a presence on earth that could convince me of that; and frankly, you don't know what you're talking about.

The so-called ""Original Theatrical Release"" featured in the new 4-disc ""The Movie"" set may have cut out all those unnecessary ""director's cut"" scenes (present in 2000's 4-disc all-movies DVD set) -- for example, 1) an elongated council meeting between Jor-el and the scientists who don't believe his ""outlandish"" theory that Krypton will soon be destroyed and 2) after Superman's initial set of rescue sequences (starting off with the Lois Lane helicopter grab), he has an extraneous, melodramatic consultation with Jor-el in the Fortress of Solitude (with the exact same musical score from an earlier scene where Jor-el bids farewell to his infant son on Krypton; a technique which I despise, as if there wasn't enough dramatic music stock from John Williams' incredible score).

BUT... what the creators of this new DVD set didn't do was purge the HORRIBLE trumped-up ""enhanced"" sound effects from the 2000 DVD release (yes, I looked for a way to turn it off in some sort of audio feature, but you can't). And it's obvious almost immediately. A little background before my explanation: I regard the opening credit sequence of ""The Movie"" as one of the most heart-pulsatingly effective credit sequences I've ever seen (and heard) on film -- from that exquisite trumpet solo as Superman makes his first appearance in comic form (Action Comics) being read by a child, to the first-person ""flight"" over The Daily Planet globe, and on thru the bright-blue ""whooshing"" trails of the transparent credits as we travel to Krypton aided by Williams' never-to-be-matched march (simply amazing!). My problem with the ""enhanced"" sound effects -- and where I knew they STILL hadn't given me the ORIGINAL original theatrical release as advertised -- was in the ""whooshing"" credits sound from ""ALEXANDER SALKIND PRESENTS"" onward that all but drowns out Williams' exceptional score (where the original whooshes complemented the score). And much worse, we're not given that EXPLOSIVE WHOOSH sound at the first appearance of the Superman red-and-yellow shield -- now (as was in 2000) replaced by an over-whooshy (pardon my terms) sound with a clank at the end (the rest are over-whooshy sans clanks). And what about that ""nails on chalkboard"" crystal squeal after Krypton and its red sun have blown to smithereens or when young Clark first builds the Fortress? It's almost too much to bear (it actually hurts my ears now).

But this was all part of the 2000 sound effect enhancements; if you don't believe me (and you have a copy of it), compare the ""whooshing"" sound effects from either this DVD or the 2000 DVD (exact same enhanced sound effects I've noted in both) with the videotape version (you can still find it in some video stores).

And speaking of ears, I couldn't believe them in 2000, and now I'm just pissed off about it in 2007. Will I return the DVD because of this ""oversight""? Most likely. Will I send a complaint to Warner Bros.? It's on its way. Am I alone in my disgust? Highly doubt it (and I'd sure better NOT be).

The extras are nice (the ony reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1), but so what? Please help in my campaign to get what we've been asking for -- a pure ""Superman: The Movie"" DVD release. I'm not going to settle for anything less, and neither should you.",1181433600,13,3717,4.827315541601256

I first saw the film in 1978, when everyone was excited about seeing a film about the mythical superhero (before we all became jaded by endless superhero films). I remember being surprised by Margot Kidder's performance as Lois Lane; I was a child then, and I had always thought that Lois was supposed to be a very passive character, not an assertive, hard-working woman. Kidder changed that for me.

This film, regardless of the input of many talented artists, will always and indelibly belong to the late Christopher Reeve. It makes my heart ache to see him, young, strong, beautiful, and able-bodied. I had forgotten how good he really was; he's so good, you can easily miss the little subtleties he brings to his characterization. It was his first starring role, and he holds his own effortlessly even against such heavyweights as Brando and Hackman. He manages to be believably self-effacing and klutzy as Clark Kent, and believably strong and moral as Superman - NOT an easy task, by any means.

I believed that he would walk again, after his tragic accident. Then we suffered the bitter, heartbreaking loss first of Christopher Reeve, then of his incredibly strong wife, Dana. Now, THAT is a story worth telling.

This is the single best casting job ever performed in Hollywood, and nobody knew, at the time, how perfect or compelling it would be. Reeve had less than two decades of able-bodied life ahead of him; he would be gone from us before thirty years had passed. He didn't just play the part of Superman; he WAS Superman, with a strength, courage, and determination that even the Man of Steel didn't possess.

608444,5,6303212263,"The theatrical version of Richard Donner's Superman still holds up as the cinema's best superhero movie despite three decades' worth of advances in special effects and the arrival of almost every other comic book hero on the big screen, largely because at heart it's more a movie about what it means to be in a position where you have the power to do anything except what you really want. Although it's not without humor - it's dotted with neat little in-jokes that compliment rather than swamp the film, like Clark's brief glance at a payphone that's definitely not fit for his use - it takes itself and its characters seriously, with the absolute belief and integrity that Christopher Reeve brings to the part managing to transcend the inherent ridiculousness of a flying man who wears his underpants outside his tights. Marlon Brando's dignified performance sets the tone perfectly - this is indeed no mere fantasy, but something that carries some real emotional weight, with Kal El's journey to becoming Clark Kent and Superman one of loss and powerlessness despite his abilities. Yet rather than burying the picture the way the relentless one-note gloominess of Bryan Singer's take on the character did in Superman Returns, Donner mixes a classic epic style of filmmaking with a sense of joy and exuberance that makes the film seem a lot shorter than its 143-minutes, and throws in one of the great action setpieces of all time in the helicopter rescue sequence. Great filmmaking and great fun too.

Also included on the 4-disc set is Donner's slightly longer director's cut and a wide variety of excellent extras including all the extras from the previously released double-sided Director's Cut edition as well as nine of the classic Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons from the 1940s. However, be warned that some early copies of the theatrical version didn't include the original 1978 sound mix but featured a remastered track with additional sound effects.",1174348800,,1970,5.0244648318042815

So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the 'full' movie until now. And I have to admit, it's far, far superior to Bryan Singer's self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns.

It actually takes quite a while to get going, but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.

Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that?

Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated, clumsy, meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody, including secret love Lois Lane, falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination (the modern term for World Domination). But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.

Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography, the music, the editing, the pacing. I won't call the SFX fake, since it doesn't ever take you out of the film, so I'll just call them 'quaint'. For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation.

Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle, such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don't you think?

It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years, will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule, I think not.

Inserted scenes are consistent with the rest of the film.  Never looked better.  Still, 1978.

On Disc-3 are the three documentaries that can also be found on the 2001 DVD, each one running about thirty minutes in length--Taking Flight: The Development of Superman, Making Superman: Filming the Legend, and The Magic Behind the Cape.  There's also a look at some deleted and restored scenes.  Finally, on Disc-4 is a fifty-minute 1980 TV documentary on The Making of Superman: The Movie.  A lot of this is already included in the three documentaries on Disc-3.  There's also the fifty-minute 1951 movie, Superman and the Mole Men, starring George Reeves and Phyllis Coats, plus nine Superman cartoons from the 1940's.

I have to admit, however, that I enjoyed the first half of the film more than I did the second.  The first half was much more serious in tone, while the second half was striving to be campy and joke-filled.  There were also a couple of plots holes in the second half of the movie that the viewer just has to overlook.  An example is that if Superman can fly fast enough to turn the earth's orbit backwards in time, why couldn't he get to Lois Lane's sinking car fast enough to save her?  Anyway, because it had been so long since I'd seen the movie, I didn't really notice anything different with the expanded edition.  Nothing stood out for me, which is why I don't think eight minutes amounts to much, though it is better than the minute-and-a-half that Donner added to Lethal Weapon 3 for the Director's Cut.

I did enjoy the documentaries on Disc-3.  It was fun seeing just how skinny Christopher Reeve was when he auditioned for the role.  Also, I didn't know that Richard Donner had been fired from Superman II, though he already had 50-to-70% of the movie in the can.  He was actually doing Part I and II at the same time.  It was interesting to hear how Warner Brothers didn't want anything to do with the movie at first, but then began to cought up money once they finally realized just how good the film was going to be.  And, before Richard Donner was brought in to direct the film, the producers had hired Guy Hamilton to do it.  Hamilton was the director of Goldfinger.  It was only because the shooting location of the film was eventually changed from Italy to England that Hamilton was dropped (he hadn't paid his taxes in England) and Donner was brought on board.  Hamilton had already been involved in a year of pre-production with the film, but Donner couldn't use any of it and had to start over from scratch.  Donner was under a tremendous amount of pressure by everyone (for example, the producers had Richard Lester ready to step in at any moment as the director), yet he managed to get the movie made.  It turned out to be one Warner Brother's biggest hits.  Donner's reward was to be fired from Superman II.  Hollywood!

Disc-4 didn't do that much for me.  As I said, parts of the 1980 documentary had been included in the three 2001 documentaries on Disc-3.  I did watch the short movie, Superman and the Mole Men, which was pretty funny.  The Mole Men were played by little people with rubber bald caps on and a black jump suits.  I found myself laughing out loud when Lois Lane first sees them and freezes in absolute fear.  The expression on her face is priceless.  Then, a mother in the near-by town sees them and screams so loud that people several blocks away can hear her as if she's standing right next to them.  Man, that was one loud scream!  I will say that George Reeves was a much better actor than people gave him credit for.  I felt he was smart to play Clark Kent as a straight, hard-hitting reporter, rather than as a bumbling, navie innocent the way Christopher Reeve did.  As far as the cartoons go, I didn't watch any of them.  Wasn't interested.

If I had it to do over again, I'd pick up the 2001 DVD edition of the expanded film and save fifteen dollars.  Last, but not least, for any of you interested in Superman II, there are now two versions of it out, so be careful in buying.  One is the Richard Lester version, which I got by mistake, and the other is the complete Richard Donner edition.  I barely made it through the Richard Lester version.  Though Sarah Douglas is sexy in it as Ursa, the film just doesn't hold up for me and seems too silly.",1169596800,8,5072,4.552486187845304
608518,3,6303212263,"To me Superman is the quintessential superhero. Buff, wholesome, bright and dull. He fights for good and exists without any inner conflict, no time for any of that when there is a world to save. Those well meaning but shrug inducing qualities carry over to this film which wants to be everything (comic book, romance, disaster flick) to everybody (nerds and non-nerds), and while it has endured all these years it did not win me over. Everything starts off well enough as the first hour is almost entirely Superman back story. And it is pretty rich back story considering that before he could even walk he was involved with political treason, exploding planets, paternal sacrifice, and a trip across multiple galaxies. All this exposition does dull the storytelling a little but I wish that all franchise movies were this disciplined. What sank the movie for me was where it went from there; Superman as an adult fighting all the evil he could. Instead of an actual plot with twists and turns, we get an extended montage. Superman saves the day. Superman catches a thief. Lex Luthor causes some evil doin'. Superman stops him. There is far more energy spent pandering to the crowd than there is on making any of this plausible.

A very basic outline has Lex Luthor, in one of the most ambitious plots in history, planning to blow off the western edge of California so as to make his own property value go up (better plan than just trying to keep the undesirables out, yes?). Superman, meanwhile, spends a lot of time hanging around Lois Lane. She is the perfect match for him as she is always on the verge of certain death thanks to her inability to use her head. He saves her, she falls in love, girlfriends in the audience are no longer mad that they came. Lois Lane is so stupid in fact that she doesn't notice that her co-worker Clark Kent is actually Superman only plus glasses and minus that hideous outfit. Eventually Lex Luthor shoots a missile into the San Andreas Fault so as to put his plan in motion. Superman, ever the hero, then drills himself into the fault and fixes it. . .by hand! And at that point the film had lost both its connection to reality and me.

I do think our obsession with the Superman myth does expose us to be some pretty funny people. We flock to these films to watch the impossible happen, like being able to save the pretty girl and have her fall in love. And to remind ourselves that if the girl could just look a little deeper, past the glasses, that she would find something truly super. I did find it odd that Superman openly states that he is fighting for the American way (um... Corporate Greed? Imperialism?). You could argue that his skills might be better put to use in Somalia as opposed to constantly rescuing a girl he fancies. . . but I guess Somalia is on its own. So despite the restrained first hour and the great set design for Lex Luthor's lair (an abandoned wing of Grand Central Station) I recommend you stay away from this. It is bloated and may cause severe eye rolling. Then again, from a historical perspective, this is the film that opened up the flood gates for the dozens (and dozens!) of other comic book movies that followed. So if you want to see the cause of ""Catwoman"" give this one a little look see. **3/4",1169251200,4,3276,4.522765598650928

608522,5,6303212263,"What Star Wars did for science fiction and fantasy films, Superman did for comic book films. In fact, Christopher Nolan (director of Batman Begins) frequently credits Superman with how to do comic book films correctly.  He wanted his own film to be on that level.

 I was seven-years-old when I went and watched the movie.  As a young kid, I was a huge fan of the old Adventures of Superman, and ignorantly, that's what I thought I was going to see: a movie with all the characters from the television show.  I still recall walking out of the theater absolutely dumbfounded by such a fantastic film that made Superman come alive.  It was the flying scenes that captivated me.  It looked so real to me, especially compared to the dated effects of the television show.

Thankfully, an unknown actor, Christopher Reeve, was chosen to play the part.  In the extra features Richard Donner cites that Reeve immersed himself in the part and even made his body move in such a way that you felt he was flying, even though he was strapped into a harness.

As I've stated in my Smallville reviews, the thing that makes Superman so compelling is that Clark Kent is his disguise, and Superman is who he really is.  Most heroes have it the other way around.  Reeve also recognized that to pull off a realistic disguise, he'd have to act much differently as Clark Kent.  Crediting Cary Grant as the man he borrowed his ""nerdy"" persona, Reeve successfully creates two separate identities.  It's believable that nobody would ever suspect the nerdy, bumbling, and clumsy Clark Kent was being the Man of Steel.

Other performances in this film are very good.  Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, even though he decided to give Luthor a decidedly humorous spin.  I still like Michael Rosenbaum's depiction the best from Smallville, but these are two different eras.  Ned Beatty is hilarious as Luthor's bumbling henchman, Otis.

It's also great to see Jackie Cooper after all of these years (from the Our Gang) to take on the role of Perry White.  He's great in the role as well, giving White a fiesty side.

Margot Kidder also does a good job as Lois Lane.  I had to admit that she was a pleasant surprise.  Considering the women she beat out for the role such as Lesly Ann-Warren and Cindy Williams, it speaks highly to her interpretation of the character.

It's nearly an hour before Superman finally shows up, but when he does, it's a scene that even by today's standards still takes your breath away as he flies up to catch the falling Lois Lane with one hand and then catching the helicopter in the other.

You simply can't mention the greatness of this film without talking about the timeless music of John Williams.  The opening credits that start with one of Williams' signature pieces simply speaks to the power and grandeur of this cinematic masterpiece.  Donner still recalls vividly of being literally speechless and feeling the hairs on his body stand up when he first heard John Williams' rendition.

If you're going to do a comic book movie, you have to know the character.  Unfortunately, most people who attempt to do comic book films don't know the character, and the characters are only shadows of who they truly are.  The first four Batman films are a testament to this.  Sam Raimi is an avid Spider-Man reader, and Christopher Nolan has also been a Batman reader for quite some time.  Richard Donner also immersed himself in the world of Superman to make sure that he made a film that stayed true to the character.

Superman is the hero that all other heroes are compared to.  There is no other hero who retains such a mystique and grandeur of goodness and justice.  Unlike Batman who is driven by vengeance or even Spider-Man who is driven by guilt and responibility, Superman is driven by a sense of trying to make the world as a whole a better place.

Superman transcends the comic book world to be an American hero as well, as he embodies all the things that we, as Americans, hold nearest and dearest to ourselves.  This film gives us that Superman.",1167523200,5,4057,4.655414908579465

608547,3,6303212263,"The Donner/Puzo version of Superman is a tough nut to crack. On the one hand, it revitalized a pulp action character that had been floundering for some time, by a big budget and some highly competent film-making. On the other hand, it did so by giving him a gravitas that could best be described as undeserved. During the mid-70s, comic book writer Elliot Maggin slowly formed Superman into a kind of sci-fi, cosmic Christ figure, with all sorts of ""salvific"" undertones. When Mario Puzo was assigned to write the script to Superman: The Movie, he talked at length with Maggin and apparently got many of his ideas from the comic writer--including, we can surmise, the messianic ideas that appear in this film. In many ways, this was a stroke of brilliance. The frequent occurrence of Superman ""saving"" people from dangerous situations was merged with a Christic atmosphere to produce one of the most popular superhero movies of all time.

Despite the ""mythos"" of the first half of the movie, the rest is dragged back down to the pulp level. Superman's Clark Kent alter ego is the nerdish it's ever been, and the supporting characters rarely add anything but a bit of background texture. The Lex Luthor of the film is a bit of a dandy, and his plan to destroy California using nuclear missiles is made even sillier due to his motivation: real estate. It's like imagining Jesus came to save humanity from fart jokes. And, alas, the time travel conceit at the very end destroyed the best emotion in the film, in reaction to Lois's death. (Unfortunately, the 20-years-later sequel ""Superman Returns"" copies too many of these mistakes.)

This movie promises much, delivers some, and skimps the bill on the rest. There's no denying that Christopher Reeve delivered a great performance, but I'm inclined to think that he's the only thing that made this movie good. The plot and the characters needed some rethinking before it went into production. Still, it's entertaining and has many ground-breaking effects.

608549,4,6303212263,"This is the excellent movie that effectively began the superhero movie genre.

The DVD version of the movie has two additional scenes not in the theatrical version.

One is an additional scene of Superman listening to a recording of his dead father, Jor-El, in the Fortress of Solitude before ""becoming"" Superman.  This apparently takes several years, as he is a late-teen Clark Kent when he enters the Fortress, and Christopher Reeve when he leaves.

The other is the famous ""Gauntlet of Death"" Superman must pass through before the first time he enters Lex Luthor's subterranian home.

In my opinion, both scenes are weak, unnecessary, and hurt the pacing, particularly the latter.

The DVD also has two deleted scenes.

The first develops the relationship between Lex Luthor and Miss Teschmacher.  I think this is an excellent scene that should have been included in the movie.

The other shows a vengeful Luthor preparing to kill Teschmacher for betraying him.  Superman shows up and saves her at the last moment.  This scene was unnecessary and would have harmed continuity with the sequel, so I agree with the decision to leave it out.

The DVD also contains some screen tests for the parts of Superman, Lois Lane, and Ursa.  Margot Kidder was chosen over Stockard Channing for the part of Lois Lane.  Go figure.  The director explains that Channing projected too much strength and intelligence.  This would have been more in keeping with the character of Lois Lane as she is traditionally depicted in other sources, and Superman's attraction to her would have been much more understandable.  Donner chose to go in a different direction.  I think this was a huge mistake.

Christopher Reeve got it.  He got the characters, both Clark Kent and Superman.  In the current Superman Returns, Brandon Routh got Superman, but didn't really have a clue about Clark Kent.  This is one of the reasons why this first Superman extravaganza is the gold-standard.

Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) was very much on target with her character too.

Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor was more comical than menacing, but I think it was more entertaining that way.

For the time that it was produced in, it was a very good movie. All the major performers did a good job in terms of the characters that they were playing.

I have always liked Christopher Reeves. One of my favorite movies of his is ""Somewhere in Time"". It is one thing to have the prespective of him as the actor that he was before his terrible accident and what he was after the accident. Either way he was a wonderful person and became a great person that people really could and should be inspired by.",1156550400,,715,4.492307692307692

I like Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. He's campy, but not creepy. He's dangerous, but still likeable.

Now to the bad...

There have always been some things that nagged me about the Superman movie.

1. They spend too much time focusing on Krypton and Marlon Brando's Jor-El. After appearing in Last Tango in Paris, Brando should have been forbidden from stepping witin 5,000 miles of anything having to do with the wholesomeness of Superman. It's almost an hour into the film before we see Kal-El as Superman because of all the time given to Brando. Set up is necessary. An homage to Marlon Brando wasn't.

2. I never could buy that Superman would forsake the whole world for Margot Kidder. Not only is she plain in the looks department, but Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane is as a chain smoking, hamburger in the morning eating, freshly squeezed orange juice drinking, cynical, harn-nosed reporter who is more reckless and nosey than she is charming. Her only redeeming qualities are that she's good at her job and loyal. But I will certainly not deny that Margot Kidder is a good actress, and that beats out looks in my book when it comes to the art of moviemaking. Her good acting is also why she made the Lois Lane thing work. However, I still don't buy a mini-god like Superman going bananas over her.

3. The ""turn back time"" thing. I have a problem with Superman turning back time for two reasons. One, he is warned not to interfere with human history, yet he does and nothing bad happens for him breaking the rule. Why have it as a rule if nothing bad happens when it's broken? Secondly, if he could fly that fast around the earth to make its time go back, then why didn't he fly that fast to begin with to keep the initial disaster from happening?

4. I thought the boy who played Clark Kent was the wrong choice.

Other than these detractions, Superman is a satisfying film. I think Superman II was the best of the series, but second place isn't always bad.",1156464000,2,2145,4.582245430809399

608685,5,6303212263,"Be warned: THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!

The first of the late Christopher Reeve's appearances as the legendary Man of Steel is also the best. In this one, we learn of Superman's origins on Krypton, starting with his father, Jor-El, conducting the trial of 3 Kryptonian criminals (who would appear in Superman 2) charged with treason & sedition. Jor-El sends his only son, Kal-El, to Earth so that he will not perish with the doomed planet. Kal-El lands in the midwest U.S. and is adopted by the Kents, who name him Clark. After Jonathan Kent dies of a heart attack, Clark learns of his true identity, and the 'Fortress of Solitude' is created from the Kryptonian crystals contained in his ship. As an adult, Clark takes on a job with the Daily Planet paper. One night, as he leaves work, he sees a helicopter crash on the building's roof. From this night on, he will be known as SUPERMAN! His mission: 'To fight for truth, justice & the American Way'. A devious psychopath named Lex Luthor has other ideas - including a plot to hijack 2 nuclear missiles to strike California's San Andreas Fault, creating an earthquake that will wipe out the California coastline. Superman must race against time & overwhelming odds to stop Luthor & the missiles before millions of innocent people perish.

Considering that digital effects didn't exist when this was made, the flying sequences are AMAZINGLY realistic! Reeve looks like he is actually flying. Not to mention the story is well written and includes a couple of unexpected plot twists. And John Williams does it again with an amazing score that personifies the characters & story so well, not surprising, considering that this one came on the heels of 'Star Wars' the previous year. It was also good to see the extended footage in this DVD, especially the one as Superman goes through Luthor's gauntlet of doom, where he faces machine guns, napalm, and sub-zero temperatures - and emerges unharmed.

Baby Kal-El is rocketed from Krypton by his father (Marlon Brando), lands on Earth and is adopted by decent farm folk, and...well you know the rest. Richard Donner set a precedent for serious superhero films with this movie. It's slower paced compared to what's being made today, but it covers the important points quite well. Margot Kidder set a new standard for Lois Lane, and nothing more needs to be said about Chris Reeve. Hackman's Lex Luthor is my only point of contention; It's a solid performance, but Luthor has evolved so much over the decades that it's hard to judge this incarnation without wanting to see the scheming billionarie-industrialist over the criminal mastermind with bumbling sidekicks. Beyond that though, the special effects hold up well on a Star Wars level, and the flight scenes are still convincing.

Again this disc features a fully remastered presentation, and also re-inserts a few scenes into the film, a nice bonus. Lots of extras have been included, such as a commentary, music-only track, documentaries and old screen tests. However, Warner Bros. is releasing a large, ultimate Superman movie collection soon to tie in with Superman Returns on dvd. This disc is a solid release, but I don't know how much of the content will be repeated for the box set, so if you don't own this already it might be wise to see what's coming in a few months.

But to anyone who will be watching the movie for the first time today, it is absolutely horrible. Crazy ridiculous impossible plot with murderous explanation holes (kryptonite? why does that hurt superman again and not ordinary humans?). The real kicker was when he reversed time by spinning the earth backwards.. Oh god... If you finished high school, then this movie isn't for you.

Update:
Okay maybe I was a little bit rough with this review (especially my last few sentences). I apologize for any offense.

I think I'll just sum up what I meant to communicate back in 2006: The plot isn't very believable and the solutions to the problems posed in the movie don't even have a scintilla of sense even, in my opinion, for a superhero movie. Now it isn't very believable that getting bitten by a spider will give you spider powers or that a engineering genius can build an ""iron"" suit in his basement but at least the solutions they present to overcome the villains have a foundation in reality with a lot of creative imagination involved. Unfortunately for this movie... turning back time by doing.... *sigh

So if you really enjoy Superman and really enjoyed this movie back in the 70's then you probably will like this DVD. However if you are much younger, like me, and have gotten used to more ""modern"" superhero movies then I don't think you will like this movie.",1152748800,5,1511,4.651685393258427

608762,5,6303212263,"I was born in 1976, so I spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80's.  Although I was still a bit young when ""Superman-The Movie"" hit the big screen, I caught up with him through VHS and television.  Plenty have donned the red cape, from George Reeves to Dean Cain and everyone in between.  Brandon Routh, who I have yet to see in the latest film, is the current hero of the day.  Christopher Reeve was, is, and always will be Superman to me.  I don't care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were, Reeve is the Man of Steel in my opinion.

This film gives us the origination story of Kal-El, son of Jor-El, of the planet known as Krypton.  If you've been around for a few years, you probably know the rest of the story, so I'll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses.  I've gloated on Reeve enough, but I have to admit that his bungling, country-tinged Clark Kent is perfect.  He does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that ""S"" bursts onto the scene.  Lois Lane is done with sassy flair by the great Margot Kidder.  She, much like Reeve, has become her character in my mind.  Gene Hackman hams it up as Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor.  His over-the-top performance is fun to watch on the screen.  Ned Beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick, Otis, and Valerie Perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious Eve.  Marlon Brando is sufficient as Kent's father, but his performance comes across as rather wooden.  Terence Stamp (General Zod), Jack O'Halloran (Non), and Maria Schell (Vond-Ah) have sinister small roles in this feature, but set the stage well for ""Superman II.""  The rest of the cast, primarily reduced to supporting roles, do a wonderful job with what they have to work with.

As stated before, the special effects are pretty hokey by today's standards, but they were top-notch in 1978.  They help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen.

This film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.  While many have met, and in some cases surpassed, this standard, ""Superman"" will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks.

Highly recommended to any fan of comic flicks, or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol' Superman fly for the first time!",1152144000,13,2399,4.595294117647059
608763,5,6303212263,"This is still the best of the Superman movies to date.  While the special effects are dated and less than spectacular than he recent Superman Returns, it still exceeds as a superiorly directed, acted, and Superman presentation than any other version.

This is not to say that the more recent movie, Superman Returns  or Superman II are not fine films, they are; but here Richard Donner, still a young director at the time, manages to flush out a superior performance from Christopher Reeve and Margret Kidder.  The proof is in their careers - both actors gave their best performances in this movie, while they were yet still unpolished performers.  Gene Hackman was great with a superb dry wit and great sense of timing.

There are plenty of places to get a review of the plot so I'll skip it, but the sense of hope Superman brings to this film is great. He is America's Moses.  While the special effects don't quite make you belive a man can fly, you will get lost in the adventure and maybe be a better person for it.",1151884800,6,1019,4.53551912568306

This version, while technically great, cuts in too many (wisely cut in the first place) extra scenes and extended versions of existing scenes placing a drag on the pacing.  The original theatrical cut is considered by Richard Donner to be his 'director's cut': this version is more of a curiosity piece.  Film students could watch it to learn something about film editing and pacing.  I saw the original movie at least 15 - 20 time during it's theatrical release and feel Warner's has almost ruined the film with this presentation.  Let's hope Warner's releases the theatrical cut on the upcoming (fall 2006) Ultimate Superman collection.  One thing I will say I did like was the audio remix for Dolby 5.1.  Although I'm a purist concerning this film, they did a great job remixing the dialogue, sound effects and music.",1151798400,6,905,4.875816993464053
608765,5,6303212263,"Superman may be over 20 years old but it's still not out-dated and works for todays audience. It's a true classic with Christopher Reeves 100% becoming not only the role of Superman but Clark Kent as well. He's the best Superman and also the best Clark Kent. He had the bumbling reporter thing down pat better than Brandon Routh did in Superman Returns or Dean Cain in Lois and Clark. He also had great chemestry with Margot Kidder who played Lois Lane. The scene where he takes her flying with him is still magical and special. Eventhough I really liked Superman Returns, the scene where he flys with Lois is easily forgettable compared to the scene in this movie.

  The film also has the late great Marlon Brando as Superman's dad Jor-el in the beginning of the movie. In the Fortress of Solitude Clark is able to learn everything that he needs to know about his father and where he came from. He then becomes Superman and makes himself known to the world by saving Lois Lane. His skills are about to be put to the test by Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) who's about to start world chaos.

  Gene Hackman makes a really good Lex eventhough he was stubborn about wearing a bald cap or even shaving his mustache for the director. It's funny how Richard Donner got him to shave though. He put on a fake mustache and told Gene he'd shave if he did. Gene shaved and said ""you're turn"" and Richard said ""ok"" and just pulled off the mustache. Gene looked at him mad but then started laughing. I remember Richard Donner talking about that on a director show. Anyway Gene at least wears the bald cap for like a second at the end of the movie and in the beginning of Supeman 2. He shows that Lex doesn't need to be bald the whole movie to still be an evil and calculated mad-man though. He still did the part well. While Ned Beatty is also excellent as his dimwitted side-kick Otis. With this movie being so well made and being a great start to the Superman franchise. It's very sad that part 3 and 4 were failures. Christopher Reeves deserved a much better last Superman movie than Superman 4 since he was the perfect Superman.",1151625600,2,2115,4.4241645244215935

608768,5,6303212263,"In my anxiety to see Superman Returns, I've been passing time by watching again every Superman movie and television series (live action and animated) that I can get my hands on. I went through the George Reeves series, the Lois & Clark and Superboy/Smallsville series and the cartoon Superman, Justice League and, God help me, even the 70's Superfriends shows. But I've saved for last the piece-de-resistance: the Christopher Reeve classics.

I've genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 Superman film was, and is. A feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as ""June 1938"" flashes on the screen, then a boy leafs thru the pages of Action comics, the young lad's voiceover commenting on the Depression and the importance of truth-dealing newspapers such as the Daily Planet in so turbulent and troubled an era. Then, the immortal John Williams-crafted Superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins. True, I've always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening. But once the film focuses on Planet Earth and the arrival of baby Kal-El, it's all so good. The segment of Clark's child- and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner, giving heft to scenes of Clark learning how truly special he is, and how he is ultimately alone. These bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that Clark will become. Then, the tragedy of his adopted father's death, leading eventually to Clark's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude and thus, his Kryptonian heritage. There is almost a sense of intermission at this point, wherein the viewer can take a breath, relax and prepare for the second half of the film. I think I'll start a new paragraph.

Twelve years pass. Clark, now in his Superman guise, flies away from the Fortress of Solitude. The camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he's arrived at the Daily Planet, and Clark Kent's new chapter begins. There, he meets Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Editor-in-Chief Perry White. Clark doesn't waste time setting up his bespectacled persona  of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely-paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness. Next, Superman's nemesis shows up, the fiendishly clever and criminal Lex Luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious, though Luthor's wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor. Luthor's plan is diabolical and ably challenges Superman's abilities. But, in the end, all is well as the Man of Steel foils Luthor's scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow; Superman has a fleeting romantic moment with Lois. End of film.

Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Despite the all-star cast, Christopher Reeve makes the movie. He inhabits Superman as if he were his favorite pajamas, instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence, steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum. On the other hand, he infuses his Clark Kent with the proper amount of  ""aw, shucks"" country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms. A perfect portrayal. Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman. The reaction of the crowd upon Supe's first public appearance is still thrilling to witness. Lois Lane's freaked-out ""You've got me?! But, who's got you?"" is still a classic line. Margot Kidder is delicious as reporter Lois Lane:  nosy, plucky and in-your-face. She melts perfectly for Superman and routinely snubs Clark Kent. Go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better Margot is, compared to the other actresses that went for the role. Gene Hackman plays Luthor more comically than I would've expected but, what the hell, it works. The best I can say of Marlon Brando as Jor-El is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of Superman Returns.

The special effects, for their time, are wonderfully innovative and wow-inducing. The only effect that doesn't look convincing is the sequence where teenage Clark outruns a train. Everything else, perfection.

The special features are pretty sweet: Side A contains an insightful commentary by director Richard Donner; 10 added scenes including a young Lois with her parents on a train and a scene with Jor-El and Superman; some ""Superman - The Legacy"" fun facts; and a theatrical trailer.

Side B contains: three documentaries (""Taking Flight: the Development of Superman"", ""Making Superman: Filming the Legend"" and ""The Magic Behind the Cape""); deleted scenes; screen tests of Superman (Reeve with sweaty pits!), Lois Lane (with actresses Anne Archer, Lesley Ann Warren, Margot Kidder and Stockard Channing) and Ursa, the Kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel; a teaser trailer; and a TV spot.

This is a classic film, full of matinee fun and movie magic. It certainly has stood the test of time. Despite the fact that I can't wait to see Superman Returns, I doubt it could live up to Superman 1 or 2. Speaking of which, I think I'll pop in the sequel now.",1151107200,9,4952,5.065030674846626
608819,5,6303212263,"Arguably the best superhero movie of all time, and certainly the first decent one, is Superman: The Movie.

From the rousing opening credits to the iconic fly-by at the end, the film remains one of the most enjoyable spectacles you could ever see and even improves on dvd. The sound and picture quality is excellent although the full anamorphic frame is not always utilised in terms of setting scenes, it still looks great on a big tv.

Of course everyone knows the story, but what may surprise newcomers is the time frame in which it happens. Roughly 15/20 minutes are spent on Krypton, and another 25 minutes or so describing Clark Kent's early life. Many criticize this section for various reasons, including Brando's overpriced cameo. However, I think it adds to the epic scale of the film and makes it a true classic.

Christopher Reeeve IS Superman. His performance in both guises is spot-on and everything that he does manages to make you either smile or cheer. Gene Hackman is given plenty of one-liners and (too many) slapstick gags, but still comes across well as the genius who may just get the better of the Man of Steel. Margot Kidder is also terrific as Lois Lane, and although she gets a better-written part in the sequel, she captures the awe and amazement that we are all feeling.

The effects are probably the only thing that breaks the film up and (ironically) takes you away from the film's world. Although very impressive at the time, I'm sure, you just can't believe some of the flying images. Dont get me wrong,I hate CGI, but some of the rear projection shots don't seem to match with Supes' movements occasionally - for instance, one shot over the city sees Superman turning in the air, but the background seems to zoom in and pan etc. even though he's just turning...

But nevertheless, the overall tone and good-natured spirit of the film, combined with some of the more poignant moments, makes this an awesome feat and easily worth owning on dvd.",1150934400,2,1974,4.7101449275362315

In fact it holds up so well, even today, that the upcoming SUPERMAN RETURNS is supposably a part of this franchise, occurring six years after the events of SUPERMAN II and even features Marlon Brando in the theatrical trailer as the voice of Jor-El.
With a $55 million budget (which was enormous for its time) this movie eventually raked in almost $300 million world-wide (which even today stands as a quite respectable take.) In addition it featured a knock-out punch by John Williams who went from scoring JAWS to scoring STAR WARS and then onto SUPERMAN (amazing.)
Remastered for its 2001 DVD release this movie is a vast improvement on a master print that had deteriorated to such an extent that some sequences were close to unwatchable. This print is clearer and sharper and corrects some previous color balancing problems. It also has a remastered soundtrack that means it sounds the best it has ever since its original 1978 release.
As an added bonus it also features about eight minutes of additional footage that effectively doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with new scenes on Krypton and at the Fortress of Solitude. In addition there's more early Clark Kent and disaster footage. Finally rounding out the new scenes is the reinstated Lex Luthor ""Gauntlet of Death"" sequence which had previously been seen on network television broadcasts. In stark contrast to the ire that added scenes to the STAR WARS movies has drawn from fans, fans of this series seemed largely welcome to the additions here.
Where this DVD really shines however is in the special features, which are impressive. First up is a scene specific commentary by Director Richard Donner and scribe Tom Mankiewicz. After writing the first three James Bond movies of the 1970s Mankiewicz was brought onto SUPERMAN to help with the script, however due to certain legal complications he could nopt be credited for the work he did and so was handed the title of Creative Consultant. This is the kind of commentary that I love, it's screen specific and its light and friendly. It's like having Donner and Mankiewicz hanging out in your living room watching this beloved movie of your childhood with you. They share a number of memories on making the movie and its good to see Mankiewicz get his proper recognition.
There's also an isolated score audio track that allows the viewer to marvel at the work of Williams.
But there's more. The jewel in the crown special feature is the three documentaries that actually act more as three chapters in one larger feature-length documentary. Before the Indiana Jones trilogy came out with its three-hour behind the scenes feature and before the three-hour ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary for the STAR WARS trilogy DVD release, we have the behind-the-scenes documentaries here that presented the benchmark by which all future DVD releases were judged.
Hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) they feature on-camera interviews with Donner, (the late) Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Mankiewicz (among others.) They cover such issues as the making of the film, the failed attempts at making a man fly and the unceremonious firing of Donner who had delivered the producers a smash hit and was already over halfway through the shooting of the sequel. Still, Donner had the last laugh when several years later he got to direct all four movies of the phenomenally successful LETHAL WEAPON movies.
More a curiosity as anything else is a separate feature on the Superman, Lois Lane, & Ursa screen tests that include five different actresses vying for the part of Lois Lane.
The younger audiences that have grown up watching SMALLVILLE on the WB will no doubt be a little confused by this movie that follows a more conventional storyline than the popular Tom Welling series. I'm probably in the minority when it comes to preferring the incredible Erica Durance as Lois Lane, but Margot Kidder does an admirable job here and Gene Hackman is an interesting choice as Lex Luthor.
However, where there is no debate is Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time of casting this movie Reeve embodies the part of Clark Kent and was elevated to even more mythic proportions by the courage with which he tackled his unfortunate accident.
Starting with the death of Krypton and ending with Superman saving California, this movie (and its sequel) set a good foundation for SUPERMAN RETURNS and this DVD should find a place of honor on the shelf of every self-respecting DVD collector.",1145491200,9,4793,4.98501872659176

608859,4,6303212263,"I saw this fim as a kid many years ago and liked it a lot.  Sometimes, those childhood favorites end up being rather lame films when you watch them as adults.  This is NOT the case with Superman.  I enjoyed this film from start to finish and it brought back all of the good memories I had of it.  Each character was played almost perfectly... Lex Luthor, Lois, Ms. Tessmocher, Superman himself, etc, etc.  The solid cast really helped this movie stand out.  The music is great as well which may not seem important in a movie but I believe it is.

The Special edition of the DVD is an excellent transfer with some very cool added scenes that I feel adds to the movie in a very positive way and helped to fill in the story.

Of all the Super-hero movies this is the only one that really came out this well as most of them are horribly dorky.  I have watched and will continue to watch this film and of course Part II many times and will enjoy it each and every time.  It's also nice to be able to play it for newer generations as they appear to really like it too.

Why not 5 stars then?  Well, I would have gone 4.5 if it was an option but I rarely give any movie 5 stars.  The only issue with this film is that the special effects are generally a little weak and do look pretty dated.  I understand that it as made a while ago but I feel that they could have tried a little harder with some of the special effects, especially the flying sequences.  Still, it's just nitpicking and overall it does look pretty good and is convincing enough.

Go ahead and buy this version of the DVD with confidence, it's a great transfer with good sound and the extra footage is a nice bonus.

608860,5,6303212263,"What usually happens for me is that if I've been exposed for one particular stage of pop culture for a long period of time, everything else seems kind of ""off"". Take for instance old country music: my grandparents/parents love it but I can't stand it. So when you take Superman, in which I've watched the animated series and 5 1/2 seasons worth of Smallville, anything else might not have that same luster. Like when I see this Lex Luthor, I always instead imagine Michael Rosenbaum, or Dana Delany doing the voice for Lois Lane. However, it's still a great film that was before my time but came out at the perfect time.

In case you've been living on Mars in a deep hole with metal music in your headphones, the story of Superman is the last son of the planet Krypton who arrives on the planet Earth. Capable of incredible powers, he decides to fight for good and stand against those wanting to cause harm or rule the planet, either/or. And so it is with Superman the movie, the same basic story but just up on the big screen.

This is a 1970's film so some images look very outdated. Certain flying shots in particular have an obvious pasted look to them but that's ok, since 1) this is the 70's and 2) you just don't care. One fault I did find though: whether it was my DVD player, the film itself but one of the chapters got a little ugly(for me it was the pilots on Air Force One talking about Superman), it got a little pixel-y. However, considering it is an older film, it's quite something to see the film restored.

My favorite Lex is probably Clancy Brown from the Animated Series or Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville. Here, Gene Hackman does an admirable job but there wasn't much of a threat there, he just seemed there to give something important to Superman to do. Dana Delany and Erica Durance are probably the hottest Lois Lane's but Margot Kidder is good in the role. Believable without being damsel in distress throughout the whole thing. It's up for debate whether Marlon Brandon earned his 3 million paycheck(some say 10) since he's only in here for under 10 minutes but oh well he looks good as Jor-El. It's funny seeing him mispronounce names though(it's Kryp-TON not Kryptin).

And of course we come down to the Man: Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time(much like upcoming Brandon Routh in Superman Returns), he embodies the character, bumbling and nervous as Clark Kent and confident and likable as our main hero. He even makes a scene work when late in the film Superman does a silly time rewind but the anger he displays makes up for it. Even in the lackluster sequels he still brings his A game which is quite something.

Da da da DA da, da da da DA da....it's hard not to finish watching Superman and not hum the main theme. It gives the opening credits a nice big epic atmosphere even though the dumb names keep going! It felt like one of the longest opening credits I've ever seen, or at least that's how it felt but the opening theme as well as the rest of the film is especially great from John Williams in a rare non-Spielberg film score.

Personally I hate Warner snap cases and this film really should've been on a big 2 disc release instead of a flipper but oh well we get a great film and that's what matters in the end. Now let's see how the new one does.",1141948800,4,3303,4.451239669421487

Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial).

Up until this film, no one had ever thought of putting a serious adaption of a comic book on the big screen, until WB hired Richard Donner to helm a movie based on the popular comic book hero Superman.

It seemed like a daunting task. There were difficulties with casting the part (Clint Eastwood and James Caan, among others, turned the role). However, they finally found the right guy in an unknown. 6'4, 20 something actor named Christopher Reeve. A large group of talented actors as well as composer John Williams and other talented behind the scenes whizzes joined Donner and Reeve, and Superman was ready to fly high.

The film begins on the planet Krypton, where its leader Jor - El (Marlon Brando) has learned that the planet is about to be done in. Wanting to leave behind an heir, he sends his son Kal - El to Earth, where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford and an actress whose name I forget). Raised as Clark Kent, he grows up to learn that he has powers far beyond a normal man, and adopts a new persona: Superman. Under his Clark Kent persona, he takes a job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, where he falls in love with beautiful journalist Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Meanwhile, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is plotting to wipe out the West Coast with twin nuclear missiles, and only Superman can stop him. Can Superman save the day?

This movie was a big budget production that was in development since late 1976 when producer Alexander Salkind bought the movie rights for it with Warner Brothers ( who owns DC comics) and hired the director of ""The Omen"" Richard Donner to bring to life the beloved superhero icon of all time. People were amazed by the teaser back in late 1977 then the movie came out in december of 1978 to become one of the highest grossing movies of the year with rave reviews and a classic for all comic book fans everywhere, Christopher Reeves with the other cast are superb in it even with the three Kryptonian crooks ( Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran) who get imprisoned and become the villains for the second movie, Ned Betty as Otis and Jackie Cooper as the boss of the daily Planet Perry White.

Superman is one of the most exciting superhero flicks ever, and one of the best movies ever made!
You all know the story already: young Superman, Kal-el, the son of Jor-el, played remarkably by Brando, is sent to earth by his father right before his planet Krypton bursts into smithereens. He lands in a small town called Smallville, picked up by the Kent family, and raised as their own child that they name Clark. Clark grows up with unexplainable super powers, like scoring touchdowns all the time, kicking a football across the state, and racing trains and winning. Clark discovers a piece of kryptonite in the barn of his earthly parents' farm that tells him to head north, where he, or the toss of the kryptonite, builds his new home Krypton on earth where he meets the image and voice of his father who expains to him that he is not one of the humans. Years later, he's wearing tight blue pants, a red cape, and shirt that has the sign S on it. You know the rest of it so I'll stop right here.

Superman was a major motion picture event when it was released back in 1978. It still is today despite the more advanced special effects in movies today. Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luther, Superman's nemesis who plans to destroy the world and take over, while Reeve, in his first major starring role, shines as Superman, a role he would find hard later on to escape the shadow of, and pass away nearly 26 years later and be remembered for nothing more than that.

The film is electrifying, entertaining, engaging, and absolute fun for the entire family.

608921,4,6303212263,"Watching 1978's SUPERMAN again after all these years, I'm picking up on symbolism I missed when I saw the film as a kid.  Superman is sent to earth by a white-haired, white-dressed glowing Marlon Brando.  He grows up in humble surroundings.  At 18, he leaves home to go to a desolate location to find himself.  ""Twelve years later,"" which makes him 30-years-old when he announces himself to the world as a super man.
(As Perry White rants, the reporter who gets his first interview will get the most important story since ""God talked to Moses"").
Little touches, I know, but I thought it was interesting to notice now.

Actually, what I always remembered was Gene Hackman's funny performance as Lex Luthor.  The two lines my friends still quote are:
""It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to move those legs.""
And, ""You were followed again...in spite of those cat-like reflexes.""
The special effects may look dated and the romance part is a bit much for a comicbook movie, but Hackman is hilarious and Luthor's ""real estate"" plot is the most inspired criminal enterprise since Auric Goldfinger tried to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox.

The extras are great.  Watching the various actresses doing screen tests, you can see how Margot Kidder really nailed the role.  The others were good but the chemistry is there with Reeve and Kidder.

Although it's probably lost on young people today, I loved the shot of Clark Kent running up to a phone booth and looking annoyed at the half-booth (anyone born since this movie came out would not remember that phone booths were once big enough for a man to change clothes in).",1136419200,5,1630,4.7686832740213525

Cast:  Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margott Kidder, Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure

Running Time:  143 minutes

Rated PG for peril, some mild sensuality, and language.

Richard Donner's spectacle of an adapation of the popular comic book is one of the most charming, sensitive, yet action-packed superhero films to hit the big screen.  ""Superman"" opens with the beautiful and far more advanced planet of Krypton. On this planet, in an arena of some sort, we witness the respected elder, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) passing judgment on three malevolent characters named General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran). After the elders of Krypton find these three villains guilty, Zod promises vengeance on his jailer (Jor-El), and is sent into the vacuum of space encased in the Phantom Zone, only to return in a later chapter. Jor-El is known to be neither irrational or impulsive to his peers, but his theory of the planet's destruction is quickly shunned by the others and he is forbidden to speak another word of it. As a result, Jor-El sends his child, Kal-El, to live on our planet Earth, where he would learn to live among us. After his departure, the planet of Krypton, along with his father and mother (Sussanah York) is destroyed. Enter Smallville, a quiet, southern town, where the two kindest farmers, Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford) adopt the newly landed Kal-El, and name him Clark Kent. In his teen years, following the death of his adoptive father, he returns to his routes, with the help of the crystals he arrived on our planet with. Within the confines of his Fortress of Sollitude, he learns from the spirit of his true father, Jor-El, and becomes Superman.

Upon his arrival at Metropolis, Kal-El/Superman assumes a new identity as the bumbling and pathetic Clark Kent. He is shown as a fool, who uses words like swell and slouches. Naturally appearing as a non-aggressive wimp to his boss (Jackie Cooper) and co-workers, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure). Eventually, Clark falls in love with Lois, who in fact, loves Superman. After the world meets and greets their new hero Superman, an evil plot is brewing below the streets of Metropolis. The ""feindishly gifted"" Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is planning the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Upon buying thousands of acres of useless land in California, he'll send a rocket towards the San Andreas fault, allowing the rest of California to fall into the sea. Luthor is joined by the dim-witted henchman, Otis (Ned Beatty) and the gorgeous and also dim-witted bad girl, Ms. Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine).

Gene Hackman is suitably assured and memorably hiss-able as the bad guy Lex Luthor while Marlon Brando provides a fittingly masterful and natural performance as Superman's biological father, Jor-El. Margot Kidder makes an unusual heroine who is a little more self-assured than the stereotypical female lead in adventure movies. She probably has the best scream of any damsel in distress but is not as physically beautiful as many other Hollywood actresses of the time. Christopher Reeve is, without doubt, the best Superman ever, blending his invulnerable macho charisma with the almost inept and wimpish Clark Kent to brilliant and humorous effect. Christopher Reeve actually looks as well as acts different while playing his alter egos and makes the entire outlandish premise just that little bit more believable.

The turmoil Superman feels within is expressed neatly during the film and we see that, even if it looks like we have everything (perfection in Superman's case but it could just as easily be money or anything) we will still want what is free to all of us, love and affection from someone dear to us.  Special effects range from very good to brilliant and simply add to the film. Some clever moments include Superman rescuing Lois from a helicopter disaster atop a skyscraper, Superman dissuading a thief from making his escape, a scene where Superman flies off and, apparently without a cut, walks back in the door as Clark Kent and a frighteningly realistic and claustrophobic earthquake scene.  The music score is another memorable and stirring piece of music from master movie composer John Williams. The music is also completely fitting and is the final piece in the jigsaw.  Credit must also go to the director, Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon"" Series, ""Maverick""), who manages to maintain a relentless pace throughout, piles on the action and humour right through to the memorable climax. Astonishingly, when this movie became successful, he was fired from completing ""Superman II"" (partially filmed at the same time as this first movie until financial support dried up). Director Richard Lester (""The Three Musketeers"") was brought in to complete the filming of the second part of the Superman story. However, in Lester's hands the series went from solid to acceptable (""Superman II"") to dreadful (""Superman III"").  One of the better of its kind.",1135987200,2,5100,5.09832134292566
608923,3,6303212263,"I was very disappointed in this film experience.  The start is slowed down by way too many details about Krypton's governmental system - you get 25 minutes of Jor-el's debate with other literal luminaries in their silly aluminum-foil costumes - and then a bunch of scenes to define superman's character while a boy (most of these are part of the ""director's cut"" which while fun can also be a bore).  So the action doesn't begin until about an hour into the film, and my kids had long gotten bored by it and wandered out of the room (and I got it for them).  Even for me, a hard lover of sci-fi, it was boring - so I must warn watchers who are not committed, uncritical fans:  you will probably not enjoy this part.  It is just plain too slow, even static, which means this part is poorly edited.

Once the action starts, the film becomes pretty good.  You see pre-computer age effects to show what it wd be like for a man to fly, etc., and you can always enjoy the difference.  While they are limited to pretty silly caricatures, there is no question that the actors are good, expecially the young Reeve in the role that made him a star.  Kidder is also good, in her stunningly beautiful prime, as is Hackman.

But we are used to kid-adult films that have become much better than this, like Spiderman, Harry Potter or the Star Wars series.  They speak to both groups of watchers with richer characters, more complex and engaging plots, and slicker effects (that last is not necessarily an asset as you can always recognize computer-generated images).  As such, Superman looks like a prototype for far far better films of the genre.  Indeed, I was surprised at how disappointed I was by the film - and my kids voted with their feet.  I didn't even find the camp aspect funny enough to make me laugh.

Unintentionally following the Star Wars trend, it takes its subject seriously, which was rare for a fantasy film in the 1970's.  While Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were the first-billed names, Christopher Reeve's thoughtful and sensitive portrayal of the Man of Steel is the reason that this movie is still fun today.  He separates Clark Kent and Superman into two distinct components of the same character.  His Clark is bumbling and unabashedly dorky; his Superman is upright, well-spoken, and kind, with a heroic, baritonal quality when he speaks.  Hackman, as the nasty Lex Luthor, has a lot of fun with his character, who was a bit more zany in the 70's, compared to the megalomaniac businessman of modern comics.  Margot Kidder does OK as Lois, although her gravelly voice grates on my nerves.  Jackie Cooper is very entertaining as Perry White, the Daily Planet's gruff editor, and Marc McClure nails Jimmy Olsen.  Ned Beatty is unnecessary as Otis, as is Valerie Perrine as Miss Tessmacher.  The film feels epic at times, helped by John Williams' brassy score.  The effects, great for the time, feel dated now, but it's still fun to watch.  Christopher Reeve was meant to play this role.  This DVD edition contains a longer cut, plus some great documentaries, screen tests, and more.  Final grade - A",1134950400,,1396,4.9655172413793105
608925,5,6303212263,"I've been a superhero fan all my life.  I've especially loved superheroes in films and television shows.  There was just one superhero film I'd never seen - the original superhero film, without which we would have no ""Batman Begins"", no ""X-Men"", no ""Spider-Man"".  I needed to see ""Superman"".

The film begins on the planet of Krypton, where Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sentences three criminals to banishment.  Jor-El is aware that Krypton is about to be destroyed, but the Kryptonian elders refuse to believe him.  Moments before the planet is destroyed, Jor-El sends his one child, Kal-El, to Earth.

Kal-El's spaceship crashes in Smallville, Kansas, where he is adopted by the loving Kent family (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford).  We flash forward to Kal-El - re-named Clark Kent - in his teenage years (played by Jeff East).  After his adopted father's death, Clark travels north, where he discovers the Fortress of Solitude, an enormous ice fortress where the spirit of his deceased father, Jor-El, rests.  After conferencing with his father for a long time, Clark Kent (now played by Christopher Reeve) travels to the city of Metropolis to aid humanity.

It's easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It's spectacular.  Director Richard Donner crafts a well-told, adventurous story that held my attention from beginning to end.  Christopher Reeve was an absolutely perfect choice for Superman; the differences between his portrayals of Clark Kent and Superman are truly magnificent.  Gene Hackman is at his best as the cheery, maniacal supervillan Lex Luthor, who is aided by an enjoyably foolish Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine as Mrs. Teschmacher.  Margot Kidder does a great job of showing how head-over-heels Lois Lane is for Superman.  And Marlon Brando is terrific in his nine or so minutes of screen time.

Another high point of the film is John Williams' fantastic score.  It's easy to hear why Williams' score is so popular amongst fans of the film.  It's everything the soundtrack to a Superman movie should be.

The script, by David & Leslie Newman, Robert Benton, and famous novelist Mario Puzo is, at times, epic.  It's well-written, funny, and it never lets up.  It also remains quite faithful to the comics which the film is based on.

I'm mightly glad to have finally seen ""Superman"".  It's a fantastic film, still ranking amongst the very best superhero films nearly thirty years later.  I can hardly wait for ""Superman Returns""!

-----------------------------------------------------------

THE DVD: I don't normally talk about the DVD in my reviews, but I've got to this time.  This DVD is spectacular.  Along with a bunch of great special features, the film looks amazing - brand new at times!  The Surround mix is really super, although the dialogue sounds a little dull and quiet at times.  ""Superman"" fans are in for a major treat!",1132963200,,2859,5.042735042735043
608926,5,6303212263,"When ""Superman the Movie"" was released, the last major comic to live action adaptation was the Batman TV series.  Superhero stories were relegated to being camp at best.  At worst, it was fodder for poorly written Saturday Morning Cartoons.

Richard Donner changed all of that.  His decision to play Superman straight and set the story in a world very like our own was probably the most influential decision of the last 25 years.  Literally dozens of films have used a similar formula to adapt familiar, but not highly regarded material.  Donner's Superman serves as the template for how to these films right.

Donner and writer Tom Mankewicz were extremely smart about culling out the elements of the Superman myth that had enabled it to survive.  They made Krypton both alien and mythic.  They sold the fantasy of a wholesome, rural American upbringing that would form the mainspring of the TV series ""Smallville"".  Perhaps most importantly, they placed the two person love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane and Clark Kent at the center of the action.

The performances are all very strong.  Every actor who has tackled Superman since Christopher Reeve has compared unfavorably.  His chemistry with Margot Kidder is very strong as well.  Of course, Gene Hackman utterly re-defined Lex Luthor.

The visual effects still hold up for the most part.  The sequence with Superman flying about on his first night in Metropolis is still amazing 25 years later.  Overall, the film has held up better than I could have hoped.",1131753600,4,1520,4.99203187250996
608977,4,6303212263,"""Superman"" is one of the first films I ever saw in a movie theater when I was a child.  It wowwed me then, and it still does today.

Christopher Reeve made such an indelible impression as the Man of Steel and Clark Kent that I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  Reeve convincingly created Superman and Clark Kent as two very separate people.  Unlike many other actors who have played this role, Reeve made Clark his own person, not just Superman with glasses and a suit.

In addition, this movie has some of the greatest cinematography I have ever seen, especially the scenes on Krypton and in Smallville.  And the special effects, though they may be considered primitive by today's CGI standards, are spectacular.  I'm glad this movie was made before computer imaging took over the world of cinema special effects because it actually looks better and more real to me than if it was done with CGI.  When I look at this movie, it not only looks but feels to me like Reeve is defying gravity.

This DVD has a lot of excellent bonus features for Superman fans like myself, and the film is shown in widescreen, as it should be.  Some of the scenes which were added back in the film I think were unnecessary, though interesting.  I could see why they were removed from the original version.

In some ways, I like ""Superman II"" even more than the original because of the sequel's faster pace and script structure, but no other superhero movie is as epic and as grand as this one.",1129248000,,1483,4.533834586466165
608978,5,6303212263,"After discovering the tragic fate soon to befall his own planet, Kryptonian scientist Jor-El and his wife Lara send their only son, the infant Kal-El, to the distant planet Earth in a small spaceship, knowing that its atmosphere and the rays of its yellow son will bestow upon him powers and abilities far greater than those of its inhabitants. With his vastly superior knowledge and gifts, Kal-El will have a great advantage over the people of Earth, veritably insuring his future, but with great power comes great responsibility, to borrow from a later comic book icon. It will be Kal-El's lifelong duty to help and guide the people of Earth, to be a savior to them in times of crisis and a role model for them as they go about their daily lives.

Whether prearranged by his father, Jor-El, or completely by a stroke of terrific luck, most likely the former, baby Kal-El's ship crash lands in a field in the Rockwellian town of Smallville, Kansas, just as a kind, salt-of-the-earth, regretfully childless farming couple is driving down the nearby road. Jonathan Kent and his wife, Martha, at first don't know what to make of the strange discovery, but the toddler seems to be the answer to their countless prayers for a youngster of their very own. The couple raise the boy, instilling in him their strong values of goodness, courage, faith, humility, love, loyalty, truth, justice, and the American way. Everything seems picture perfect for the Kents and their adopted son, who they have renamed Clark, until Jonathan Kent passes away of a heart-attack and a strange glowing object calls to Clark from the barn. It is this event from which the now 18 year-old Clark Kent, also known as Kal-El of Krypton, learns that he must finally leave his gray-haired old mother and travel north to find his destiny, and so he does.

In the isolation of the cold, bitter north, the green, glowing crystal Kal-El found that night on his Smallville farm helps him to create a new home. Not a home for his mild-mannered Earthling identity, Clark Kent, but a home for his new persona, the mighty hero known as Superman! After twelve years of learning from the crystals that contain all his parents' knowledge of mankind and the universe, Superman emerges as a god among men, with skills even greater than he ever knew he had before: Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! Right away, Superman makes his presence known to the world, even as he is just settling into his new home in the fantastic city of Metropolis, and his new job as a reporter with The Daily Planet, a beacon of truth and hope across the globe. All seems to be going well with Kal-El's new existence in the hustling, bustling Metropolis, with new friends and coworkers Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in Clark Kent's life, not to mention the stern but fatherly Perry White, the Daily Planet's editor, and Superman making a name for himself as the city's own high-flying guardian angel. Things are about to get more complicated, though, as a maniacal criminal mastermind named Lex Luthor plots to wreak havoc from his secret underground lair. While Superman shuffles his heroics and reporting schedules to fit in time for courting Miss Lane too, Luthor is busy laying out a plan to sink Los Angeles into the ocean, making his recent desert land purchases immensely more valuable as the NEW west coast! Realizing Superman is the only thing that can stand in the way of his devious scheme, Lex and his bumbling cohorts research and discover the only way to kill the Kryptonian man-of-steel, green Kryptonite! With this deadly weapon now in their evil arsenal, even Superman may not be able to save the day!

In 1978, producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind set forth to make a movie like no one had ever seen before: A big-budget comic-book film called ""Superman."" Their idea was a tour-de-force of camp, but the director they hired to do the job, ""The Omen's"" Richard Donner, had a different sort of film in mind. Richard, who was hired to shoot both Superman and Superman 2 simultaneously, knew that if the film was to work, it had to be a completely believable and engrossing story of one man's struggle to make a difference with the talents giving solely to him, not a feature-length joke about the comic book hero genre. Locking in big names in the roles of Superman's father, Kal-El (Marlon Brando), and arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), Richard set the groundwork for a film that could be taken seriously, rather than just shrugged off as a kiddie flick. While an incredible team tackled the problem of inventing groundbreaking effects for a film that was abundant in the fantastic, and completely without the aid of CGI, Donner went on to the difficult task of casting his leading man and lady. He found perfection in the forms of a young Christopher Reeve and a feisty Margot Kidder. With Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, and even more high-profile names rounding out the stellar cast, made to glow by the stunning lighting and camera work of Geoffrey Unsworth and the incomparable music of John Williams, the final package was nothing short of a masterpiece! ""Superman: the Movie"" was a fantastic success, spawning three sequels, the sister-film ""Supergirl,"" and securing the last son of Krypton's place as a pop-culture icon from now to the end of time!

On DVD, ""Superman: the Movie"" looks fantastic, and the double sided disc is loaded with extras! With deleted scenes, trailers and TV spots, three 30-minute documentaries on the making of the film, a music only track and additional, alternate music tracks, a readable legacy of Superman, cast and director filmographies, and some highly entertaining screen tests featuring a variety of Lois Lanes (Anne Archer made quite an appetizing Lois), this truly is a special edition! The disc is capped off with a great feature commentary by director Richard Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz, who give a passing mention to everything from the film's clear parallels to the life of Jesus Christ (a theme continued through Superman 2, which puts its own spin on the New Testament's Book of Revelations), to personal differences between the cast and crew! It's quite an interesting listen! Whether or not an even MORE special ""Special Edition"" of ""Superman: The Movie"" will be released soon to hail the coming of the new Warner Brothers film ""Superman Returns"" is unknown at the time of this review, though it is quite likely. After all, this is the only one of the Superman feature DVDs with any extras worth talking about, and the definitive Batman film ""Batman Begins'"" DVD release next month will be accompanied by an all new set of Special Editions of the four previous Batman films. It would only seem natural that the Superman films would follow suit, and, make no mistake, ""Superman: The Movie"" will always be the definitive Superman film!

As for those 3 sequels, despite Richard Donner having been fired from directing ""Superman 2"" by the difficult and unappreciative Salkinds, the first Superman sequel is actually nearly as good as the original film! Plus, since Donner DID shoot much of ""Superman 2"" while working on the original, you have that same fantastic cast, including Gene Hackman returning with his despicably hilarious (yet not campy) take on super-villain Lex Luthor.  ""Superman 3"" is painfully underrated, and not a bad film by any means, with Richard Pryor making up for the loss of Hackman, and a lovely pre-Smallville(TV series) Annette O'Toole in the role of the adult Lana Lang. It also features some great ""Evil Superman"" stuff! ""Superman 4: The Quest For Peace,"" written by star Christopher Reeve, is easily the weakest of the three. It is often ridiculed for its flying effects and bleeding-heart storyline, but it is still watchable and mildly entertaining to less demanding Superman fans. As for the ""Supergirl"" movie, it's a shame it wasn't more successful. I can't say much for the loyalty to the comic books, my superhero fandom comes more from television and movies than anything else (my comic collection is mainly Disney and Star Wars), but I find this much razzed film to be enjoyable as a popcorn flick, and Supergirl is just hot. I own the boxed set of the Superman films and the 2-disc release of ""Supergirl."" While I may lean a bit toward the Dark Knight in terms of favorite superhero, I have always been a Superman fan (followed by Spidey and Hulk), and am addicted to the current WB television incarnation, ""Smallville."" For those of you who enjoy this film, I highly recommend that show, and don't get me started on the hotties it features. I also recommend the wonderful WB animated series, now available on DVD, and the classic Fleischer short cartoons from the 1940s! All fantastic stuff, and just a taste of what's out there! Why, even Krypto the Superdog has his own show now!",1127952000,2,8927,4.846657929226737

608981,5,6303212263,"I was 15 when ""Superman"" premiered during the holiday season of 1978.  I remember seeing it the first day at an old movie palace in downtown Philly that probably seated a couple thousand people and had a couple balconies.  The lines were around the block and I don't think there was an empty seat in the house.  From the film's opening credits and rousing theme by John Williams I was hooked.  Some 27 years later the film has lost none of it's magic.  The makers of the film deliberately take their time in exprapolating the genesis of the Superman legend before engaging us in his adventures.  Christopher Reeve was perfect as Superman, combining both the athleticism of the character with boyish affability.  He's equally fine at projecting the goofy awkwardness of his alter ego, Clark Kent.  Margot Kidder has a superb comic touch as the go-getting Lois Lane for the 1970's.  Though Lex Luthor seems more comical than menacing, Gene Hackman is effective in his portrayal.  The effects even in this CGI generation still work in particualarly the scenes of Superman in flight and the San Andreas fault sequences.  The additional scenes that have been included, particularly the ones involving Marlon Brando as Jorel, Superman's father, flesh out the story and do not seem superfluous.

There is a message in Superman, which is so simple and corny, but nothing short of true.  We're all heros, we are all great people, and even in our darkest hours our capacity for good will always shine through.  We can all be the light to show us the way to truth and justice.

608984,3,6303212263,"Superman is, to my knowledge, one of the first seamless integrations of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. It is a classic, and deservedly so; however, the times have changed. Movies used to be devoid of any complexity; as such, it was not a problem that the plot of Superman can be easily summarized in one or two sentences.  The simplicity was perfectly acceptable, as simplicity was expected. Movies were not meant to make you think.  Nowadays, on the other hand, even the silliest movies involve complex plot twists and various subplots.  They make your mind do gymnastics, whether or not you realize it.  If you watch Superman  today, expecting a movie that will blow you away in the context of modern movies, you'll be enormously dissapointed.  It's not what you would expect to see, even if you thorougly enjoyed this very same movie just a few decades ago (and hence the distorted ratings from those who merely remember enjoying the movie, without watching it before reviewing it). If, on the other hand, you view it from the perspective of 1978 cinematography, you'll understand what made this movie great. I really do hate to give Superman a mediocre rating, as doing so is completely anachronistic and unfair. Unfortunetely, I can't change my perspective: I am watching this movie in 2005, in the shadows of more modern movies.

The catchphrase in fact took great pride in the fact that the filmmakers were certain that the audience would be convinced a man could fly. Christopher Reeve, an unknown at the time stepped in the red cape and would forever embody Superman for the generations that would watch this film. Gene Hackman is dead on as Lex Luther and Ned Beatty as his cohort is hilarious.

The effects, the characters, the story, and the music in Superman The Movie are all fantastic.  It's also very cool to consider that, aside from a little modernization (circa 1978), the movie stayed true to the original story.

While the special effects were amazing when first released, I'm sure that by today's standards, a lot of it seems somewhat campy.  However, the flow and storyline are so strong, most of the aged effects are easily overlooked.

Most importantly....Superman The Movie just makes you ""feel good"".  Despite incredible abilities, Superman was still recognized as being vulnerable to emotion.  He had to deal with growing up on an alien planet and the loss of loved ones.  It made us consider...What would we do with powers like that?  He was someone who would do the right thing at any cost.

The only thing that bugs is that how the hell could superman make earth go opposite direction to go back time to save the day! It seems nobody had a problem with that?! Or am I just nitpicking?

Even if Christopher has already passed away, I still think that he is Superman and will live as superman forever. He is really humble at heart and has the same goal as superman ""to change the world and to make a difference"". I believe this movie was brilliant despite the fact that the quality of New York City looks quite dull because it was made in 1978 anyway. When Superman flies around the city, the background area which is New York City looks sort of unrealistic.

Other than that, everything is perfect the way it is. People say that in a series, the first one is always the best. That adage clearly applies to this movie.",1121299200,,755,4.5036496350364965
609030,5,6303212263,"This is a great movie that has stood up the test of time quite well. While it may not be up to snuff with some of the computer effects that we see in movies of this century, considering how they pulled off some of the effects and the all star cast that was mixed within, this movie is a real treat and a great representation of the man of steel.

We all know the story of Superman. A young baby named Kal-El is sent from a dying planet called Krypton which has a red sun radiating around it's solar system. Before the planet is destroyed the space ship carrying the baby rockets off towards the planet Earth many many light years away. Once under the radiation of the Earth's yellow sun, Kal-El will have many great powers and will become the hero and champion of the planet, named Superman.

The acting is probably one of the true highlights of this movie. Chirstopher Reeve as Superman and as the alter ego Clark Kent is probably one of the best to ever put on a superhero costume and portray a comic book character in a movie.  Once you see Reeve playing as bumbling Clark Kent, and then switch to heroic and brave Superman, you will know right away why he was in every way the right choice to play this part.

Besides the star we had a few more actors who really added a lot to this movie. Marlon Brando, who got paid an amazing $3 million to play the role of Superman's father on Krypton, Jor-El, amazingly comes off just as smooth as Reeve does. He is only in the movie for a few minutes but without him there may have been no reason to see the movie, as he was the big draw. That is debateable but I must admit he did make the most out of the role. Gene Hackman as the evil mastermind, Lex Luthor, was a very good choice. He seemed to play the role exactly as you would imagine such a person acting and had moments of humor and seriousness mixed in. Most probably won't be used to seeing Hackman in humorous parts but he pulled it off and now we couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Lastly we have Margot Kidder as Superman's love intrest, Lois Lane. As you will see on this special edition special features, there were many who tried out for the part, Kidder was by far the best and it shows in the movie. She didn't hold back with sass, excitement and humor. All the things you would expect from someone portraying Lois Lane.

The movie is really three movies in one. Starting with a sci fi feel of the planet Krypton where we learn of Superman's origins and how he came to be and where he came from and why he was sent here. Then we go to a very Norman Rockwell type of feeling Smallville, Kansas where the rocket ship carrying our hero would land. Only to be found by an old couple named Martha and John Kent. The thrid part of the movie would be in the modern, very colorful looking Metropolis where Clark Kent would find a job as a newspaper reporter for the Daily Planet and first appear as Superman, whenever there was trouble or need of a rescue.

Overall it's a great film and considering it was made in 1978, its very impressive how they pulled off some of the special effects. The tagline ""You will believe a man can fly"" was double meaning as they really didn't have any great ways to do flight in movies besides blue screens before this. This movie used every effect in the book to get flight to happen in a realistic way and if anything this movie should be noted for that amongst many other things. Every emotion and situation can be found here. We have serious situations, lots of humor, sad moments, happy moments, thrilling moments, love and romance, suspense, nuclear missiles and the goofy sidekick to Lex Luthor. You name it this movie has a bit of it mixed in. Along with great special effects and most of all, its just a lot of fun seeing Reeve flying around as Superman and saving the day like only Superman can. This is a true joy and thrill to watch.

As bonus extras on the disk there are the screen tests of both Christopher Reeve and all the actresses who were trying out for Lois Lane including Margot Kidder who would land the role.  There is a making of documentary that goes into history of the making of the film, a lot about the director, Richard Donner (who interestingly was supposed to do make the sequal as well but due to problems was let go after the first was in theaters). There is a great commentary done by the Donner as well as others involved with the movie, who clue us in on a lot of tid bids throughout and history.

Last but defintely not least there is the music score done by John Williams. Once you hear those first few notes as the credits role at the begining, you will hear SUPERMAN right in the music itself. Its brilient. The soundtrack is a must get as is this movie. I can't really recomend this enough. 30 years later, and this movie is what Superman is. It has everything you could want and more. You will not be sorry adding this to your collections as any age will enjoy this and it will most definitely make you beleive that a man can fly and then some.",1120780800,,5032,4.293993677555322
609031,5,6303212263,"Most everyone knows the story of Superman, how as a baby his parents sent him off in a rocket to save him from Krypton's destruction.  How he landed on Earth, was raised by great parents, and became Earth's greatest hero.  In 1978, Warner Brothers wanted to bring this iconic hero to the big screen with ""Superman: The Movie"".  Well audiences of course were curious to see if the movie could pull of the seemingly impossible, and to their surprise Warner Brothers proved to audiences that a man can fly.

""Superman: The Movie"" is based, of course, on the DC Comic book character of the same name.  ""Superman: The Movie"" is basically an origin film for the hero, which does an excellent job of adapting the legends origins and presenting them on the big screen.  Included are everyone's favorite characters, Lois, Jimmy, Lex Luthor, and of course Clark Kent/Superman.  Once Clark (Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent) comes to Metropolis to begin his life as Superman he earns the city's admiration as he saves Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) from a helicopter crash.  At the same time, evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is plotting to, of course, take over the world and only Superman can stop him.

With great performances from the cast, to great special effects (especially for the time it was made and suprisingly they hold up pretty well today), and brilliant directing by Richard Donner, ""Superman: The Movie"" proved you can make a comic book film seriously and it will do big money.  ""Superman: The Movie"" is one of the best comic book adaptations brought to the big screen, kick starting a huge franchise, and setting off a trend that continues to this day.

""Superman: The Movie"" is rated PG for violence.",1120089600,,1717,4.825938566552901
609032,4,6303212263,"NOTE: I included what some may consider spoilers on the first few scenes. Nothing big or crucial, but read with care...

I finally got around to watching this classic film the other night. The dramatic opening credit sequence really got me psyched, and somewhat contrary to my expectations, Marlon Brando was great as Jor-El (how could I have doubted Brando?). I enjoyed watching the setup scenes on Clark's high school years and his discovery of his Kryptonian heritage. I admit, however, that I was really waiting for the young Jeff East to exit and for Chris Reeve to step in as the older Clark/Superman. Finally Clark completes his studies on Krypton's past and we see a short teaser scene of Reeve flying toward the screen in his classic reds and blues.

But the film makers managed to keep me in suspense by stopping the action there and cutting to a scene of the bustling offices of the Daily Planet. Lois chats with Jimmy Olsen and then proceeds to enter Perry White's office where she is introduced to Reeve as the be-speckled Clark Kent. Folks, these next three or four scenes comprise the true apex of the film, not to mention the best bit of acting I've seen in some time. In fact whenever Reeve is onscreen (as Kent or Superman) you're guaranteed a fantastic performance, but this is never more evident than in his scenes as the bumbling reporter.

You won't even fully realize how talented Reeve is until the scene in which he's talking to Lois offstage. He begins as Clark. Then he starts to work up the courage to reveal his secret identity. He removes his glasses. Considers things carefully. And begins to speak as Superman. IT'S AMAZING!! He grows about 4 inches, his voice (which you probably hadn't even noticed was high) deepens a pitch or two, his expressions and gestures become noticeably more confident.....and then he decides against the revelation and IMMEDIATELY returns to the nerdy Kent.

The rest of the film was well written, but really only a few echelons above average. I would give the film a 3 or a 3.5 but Reeve shot my score up to a high 4. For those of you who haven't seen Superman yet, I won't detail anymore scenes (and there are several more good ones). But needless to say it is a MUST SEE. Go rent it, make some popcorn, and watch it with the lights out. Up, up, and AWAY!",1118793600,,2318,4.591787439613527

Superman gets the REAL treatment, it`s both serious, comic and actionfilled. This film really developes its characters. The entire cast and crew is magical; though the accident and later demise of Christopher Reeve brings sad thoughts to the mind... You really THOUGHT he was Superman, at least my generation did and still does:-)

609113,5,6303212263,"Believe it or not, I didn't catch ""Superman"" until April, 2004. It's a great flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated -- like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable) -- the movie definitely stands the test of time. In other words, there's no reason to do a remake -- they got it RIGHT the first time.

For a good review of ""Superman"" just breeze through the many fine critiques here at Amazon; for example, ""thornhillatthemovies"" just below me has a nice, thorough review.

The reason I'm writing is to point something out that no other reviewer has mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is incredibly voluptuous and gorgeous! Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this? WATCH OUT for the pool scene wherein Ms. Perrine is wearing a green one-piece bathing suit -- her God-given curves are stunning! I caught this scene on TV late one night and it convinced me to buy the flick.

Another thing occurred to me while watching the film that few reviewers mention: ""Superman"" is not just a comic-booky superhero flick, it's a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema! The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando, one of my favorite actors, playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip ""Superman"" just because you assume it's some mere superhero movie. No, it's more, much more. In fact, the screenplay was obviously written with absolutely no concern about cost, so MANY are the great F/X sequences. Enjoy.",1113350400,,1679,4.925795053003534
609114,4,6303212263,"Warner Bros. has just released a great, new DVD edition of 'Superman: The Movie', starring Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty and Marlon Brando. Directed by Richard Donner, the film has always been a standard for all of the superhero comic book films. However, the DVD edition is simply luminous. The print is beautiful, the sound great. Donner has also added footage to the film which only serves to make the experience even better. A great movie to watch at home.

Just before his planet blows up, a young boy is sent to Earth by his father, Jor-El (Marlon Brando). On Earth, he is adopted by an older Kansas couple. He realizes that he has strange powers and shortly after his father's death, sets off to the North Pole. There, he creates the Fortress of Solitude and learns about his past and how he can affect the future. Finally, the adult Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) sets off to Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet. He is attracted to the brash city beat reporter, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Soon enough, the citizens of Metropolis need the help of Superman and Lane sets out to get an interview. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is also closely watching the developments and formulating a plan.

'Superman' is a remarkably accomplished film. It is a film about a superhero, based on a comic book, in which the story is given more priority. Imagine that. In the new DVD edition, Donner has added some significant scenes set on Krypton and also enhanced the scenes set in Kansas. Watching the film again, I was struck by how realistic the scenes set on Krypton were. As CGI was not in use at the time the film was made, the filmmakers had to create worlds and special effects the old fashioned way. After Jor-El finishes his interrogation, the roof of the building moves away to allow for the convicts to be taken away. How was this done? With miniatures. And it is completely believable.

When Clark arrives in Kansas, he lives with an elderly couple on their farm. Donner and company perfectly capture the sun dappled brilliance of the countryside. Set in the 50s, everything is completely believable. Donner has added some scenes to further enhance the relationship between Clark and his mother. The landscapes are really beautiful and give the film an epic quality.

When Clark arrives in Metropolis, the city scape is jarring. From a life of relative quiet and solitude, he is thrust into a large, loud, huge city. It is also a great reflection on how the times have changed.

Upon his arrival in Metropolis, the entire film gets a little surreal, also reflecting life in the big city. Things get a little more cartoonish, but when someone is plotting to blow up California, things are expected to get a little broad.

The actors in each of the segments also reflect the type of life in each. Brando brings a quiet authority to the role of Jor-El. He is a larger than life figure, played by a cinematic icon.

Glenn Ford plays Clark's dad in Kansas. Could they have picked a better actor? As he walks around the farm, he just looks as though he belongs.

Christopher Reeve is really perfect as Clark Kent/ Superman. He brings a gangly, goofy sort of nerdish quality to Kent and a matinee idol quality to Superman. He is also remarkably restrained, making the roles all that more believable, a quality that he was able to retain for 'II', but lost, in a big way for 'III' and 'IV'.

Margot Kidder is the embodiment of Lois Lane. She is perfect in the role, brash and confident.

Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is also a standard that is perhaps only rivaled by Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in 'Batman'. Super intelligent, yet homicidal, Hackman makes the character believable, again without the histrionics so often involved with this sort of character.

'Superman' is not a perfect film. The 'I Can Fly' segment still induces groans to this day. It brings the film to a dead stop. Also, some of the flying sequences, while great for the time they were produced, are a little dated today.

'Superman' is the type of film that parents could take their kids to and enjoy with them.",1113264000,,4120,4.675414364640884
609115,5,6303212263,"A great movie from 1978 , about the Marvel comics superhero. Faced with the destruction of their planet Kryptonite, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) and his wife Lara  (Susannah York) send their infant son to the planet earth, where he is found by a childless elderly couple in Kansas. Growing up as a curiosity, by the name of Clark Kent, with superhuman strength, he becomes a reporter, who at times metamorphosis's into Superman. But nobody knows that Clark Kent is Superman. Though not even Superman's sweetheart, Lois Lane (a fresh faced Margo Kidder) knows that Kent is Superman.

Anyway it is up to Superman in this adventure to foil the evil plans of the mastermind criminal Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California. Generally thrillingly done, with a lighthearted feel through most of it, and it is noteworthy that they play a part of the 1977 hit by Supertramp, `Give a Little Bit'. It was a bit silly though when Superman flew around the Earth several times to reverse time. Couldn't he have just rescued Lois Lane to begin with.

609118,5,6303212263,"Originally released in 1978, this first film in the series, directed by Richard Donner, became, and still is, the blue print for the perfect superhero/comic book movie. All future movies of it's kind should be so good. Unfortunatley, most of them haven't been. Save a few. This original film was the ""origin"" of Superman and Clark Kent. Telling it from the beginning. Basically, here is the story. On the planet of Krypton, about to meet it's end, Jor-El and his wife Lara, send their baby son Kal-El to earth in a small spaceship. Ot crash lands in the small farming town of Smallville, Kansas. The little boy is picked up by local couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent(Glen Ford, Phyllis Thaxter). Right off the bat, the little boy showed super powers. Flash forward several years, and young Clark(as they named him, and played by Jeff East for these scenes), is leaving home. Read to go out on his own and find out who he is and his true calling. Once he makes it to Metropolis, Christopher Reeve steps into the role. He gets a job as a reporter for The Daily Planet, under the employment of Rough and grumy Perry White(The great Jackie Cooper). Soon, Clark is accquainted with feisty reporter Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), and boyishly wholesome photographer, Jimmy Olsen(Marc McClure). Gene Hackman plays millionaire madman, Lex Luthor. With the help of his sidekicks Otis(Ned Beatty), and Miss Tesmacher(Valerie Perrine), Lex plans on taking over the world, unless Superman can stop him. Ned Beatty and Valerine Perrine donate some comedic relief to the proceedings as Lex's team. This is a real high class production. The performances are well done and fleshed out, and carry the film to the grand adventure that it is. Reeve was a virtual unknown at the time, and was only 26 I believe. He did a phenomenal job his first time out, brillaintly creating two seperate people in one, with Superman and Clark. He was wonderful. Hackman is a pro, and he chews the scenery with scene stealing bravado, owning every frame he is in. Kidder was perfectly cast as Lois Lane. She had that right sense of perkiness, determination, and strength, that makes the character endearing. Cooper is a delight with his portrayal of Perry, and McClure brings the right level of 'ah shucks' to his bow tied photographer. One cannot exclude Marlon Brando, who was paid millions for his few days(and few minutes)of work on the film. The script is expertly written by Mario Puzo(""The Godfather""). It is such a well structured script that tells the beginning, and origin, of the legend, and is incredibly tight. Richard Donner's direction was flawless. He captures every scene and makes every moment count. There are numerous scenes here etched in fans' heads, and lines as well, and that makes for a rather unforgettable adventure. There are also some nice little cameos in the movie. The original Superman, Kirk Alyn, plays Lois' father early in the movie when they are on a train, and the original TV lois, Noel Neil, plays her mom. Now, with Bryan Singer doing ""Superman Returns"" for 2006, with Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois, and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, he has a lot to live up too. With Spacey being cast, it's already on the right track. The best superhero movie of all time.",1106265600,3,3281,4.8294849023090585

Son of Kal-el, Jor-el is sent to earth by his father mere moments before his home planet of Krypton is destryoed. It takes a year for the boy to travel to the earth crashing in a field to be discovered buy the Kents who raise him as their own. Though he is no ordinary boy, he has super-human strenghts and grows up to be Superman! He fights for truth, justice and the American way!

It sounds a bit hokey but after all it is Superman. Now finally we have the box-office smash, Academy Award winner and a beloved fan favorite for more than a generation, Superman: The Movie now soars even higher in a state-of-the-art digital transfer from restored elements and with dynamically remixed digital audio. There's more: the epic adventure now includes eight minutes integrated into the film by director Richard Donner. Among the highlights: added footage of the Krypton Council, a glimpse of veterans from previous Superman incarnations, a meeting with Jor-El that underscores the Man of Steel's purpose on Earth and an extended sequence inside Lex Luthor's gauntlet of doom.

Having mentioned some specifics and disc propaganda, let me say this is a great movie. While this took well over a year to shoot, (they shot this and Superman 2 simultaneously) and plagued by an ever burgening budget and producer - director infighting, this film nevertheless was a breakthrough in special effects technology. The tag line of the film was, ""You will believe that a man can fly."" And you did. They made it appear as though Christopher Reeve was flying through the air. You cannot read history backwards and say it looks fake, because maybe by todays CGI world it may look a bit hokey, but in 1978 it was a marvel, and in my opinion, it still is.

Unknown actor at the time Christopher Reeve gives us a powerful and believable performance in the dual Kent/Superman role. Hackman gives a brilliant comedic performance as Lex Luthor, and Margot Kidder rounds out an excellent cast. (On principal I am not mentioning the actor who plays Superman's father, you probably know that already).

The only contention I had with this disc was the fact that some scenes were added that were not in the theatrical cut. They were edited in and while the chapter list lets us know I feel there should have at least had a branching option to watch them within the movie or alone. Aside from that this is a stellar disc.",1105228800,,2422,4.689411764705882
609120,5,6303212263,"Released in 1978, Superman would be the first big buget Hollywood treatment of Superheroes and thus is historically a very important film as it showed studios just how big movies like this could be.  Directed by Richard Donner the movie covers the origins of Superman from the destruction of his planet of krypton to being sent away prior to its destruction to Earth where he would be found by Mr. and Mrs Kent and raised as their own son, Clark.

We see Clark as a young man coming to grips with his power, even showing off by racing a train.  With the death of his father (Glen Ford) we cut to an adult Clark going to Metropolis and getting a job with the Daily Planet and meeting Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and eventually his arch-nemesis, lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).

Long before the days of computer generated special effects, the geniuses behind Superman really did make us believe a man could fly.  His first appearance as Superman where he catches Lois Lane as she plummets to certain doom, and then catches the crashed helicopter still give me chills when I watch it.

Of course the thing that most of us will remember about Superman is its star, the late Christopher Reeve.  The man truly embodied what Superman was.  His fantastic portrayal of the geeky, fumbling Clark contrasted perfectly with his powerful and definitive portrayal as the Man of Steel.

Gene Hackman was comically evil as Lex Luthor and was joined by co-horts Ned beatty and Valerie perrine as the film's eye candy.

Mario Puzo, known for his best work in the original story of The Godfather, put together a wonderful researched story staying true to the classic comic.  This special edition contains several added scenes not in the original theatrical release featuring several more scenes on Krypton invloving Brando.  The main things about this great DVD are the 3 documentaries hosted by Marc McLure who played Jimmy Olsen in the movies.  They give a fascinating look behind the making of these movies and the problems of casting and pulling off the special effects that they faced.  Also great is the screen tests which feature some of the other actresses who were considered for the part of Lois Lane and a great commentary track by Richard Donner.

(For example, they were able to correct digitally some scenes where the costume had to be slightly green because of filming against a blue screen.)

It conflicted too much with the vision of Superman I'd developed on my own. The special effects are strong, but the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy at points, and Superman comes off as too much of an amateurish buffoon for my taste. Lex Luthor has got to be the least credible villain ever to appear in a comic-book film, and his side-kicks Otis and Ms. Tessmacher are probably the two most blatant examples of Hollywood bastardization to ever appear in comic-book film. The characters on a whole aren't taken seriously at all, and its practically a spoof of the source material. Despite what you've been told, it is anything but the definitive Superhero movie. Even as a hardcore DC Comics fan, I think I've got to give that honor to the first X-men film.

P.S: As for the infamous ending... it makes sense if you've seen Back to the Future as much as I have: just because a person goes back to a period in which they already existed doesn't mean their past self no longer exists in that period.

609170,4,6303212263,"Forget a review of the content. Its a classic, and we all know it. Christopher Reeve was able to portray both Kent and Superman as humane and realistic, and its still the best Comic-to-Movie in it's humor, humanity and epic scale.

The DVD quality is very good-I feel like its a brand new film. The special effects have worn with age, but you can't get Reeve's acting with a digital CG hero. Color, sound and clarity haven't been this good since it was released.

Some additional sequences were added, and most fit in very well. One, in particular, is a glaring mistake. It is wooden and makes Superman and Brando look silly. Superman confesses his taste for fame in the fortress of solitude, and Brando waxes on about politics and ego. Its really an oddball addition and needs to be burned. With Reeve standing there looking for a hug from Jor-El and whining.

Otherwise, the additional content was fitting and adds extra flavor to a movie which originally dedicated nearly an hour to Superman's origin. The origin was out of scale to the faster pace of the second half, but the new footage gives the second half more weight.",1097712000,2,1126,4.648241206030151
609261,5,6303212263,"The late Christopher Reeve skyrocketed to super stardom, launching a new genre of movies along the way, as ""The Man Of Steel"" in 1978's ""Superman"". Sadly, Reeve passed away October 10, 2004 from heart failure after suffering either a heart attack, slipping into a coma from which he would never awaken. The movie itself is classic: Oscar winners Marlon Brando (""The Godfather"", ""Apocalypse Now"", etc) and Gene Hackman (""The French Connection"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", etc.) shared top billing for this movie, with Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, though he had appered in bit parts in movies like ""Midway"", coming in third. The strategy worked like a charm, because not only did he closely resemble the hero of the comic strip, but also because he played the part perfectly. The special effects were flawless (the film won an Oscar for Special Achievement in Visual Effects), proving that a man CAN fly. Marlon Brando was paid $10 million for 10 minutes of screen time (he appeared in the beginning as Jor-El, Superman's real father). Gene Hackman proved he could play a cartoonish villain after violent roles in films like ""The French Connection"". Glen Ford (""Blackboard Jungle"", Midway"", etc) appears in a small role as Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father. Terence Stamp and the other two who played the Krypton renegades on trial at the beginning would appear in ""Superman II"". Margot Kidder, who played Superman's love interest, Lois Lane, did a wonderful job, becoming one of Christopher Reeve's closest friends, both on/off screen. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty provide comic relief along with Hackman (as Lex Luthor, who would go on to appear in ""Superman II"" and ""Superman IV"") as his henchmen Otis and Miss Tessmaucher (who becomes good at the movie's climax.) John Willaims' score is irrevocably classic, identifying itself immeadiately as the main theme from ""Superman"", adding it to his scores from the six ""STAR WARS"" movies (""Episode III"" to be released in theaters next summer), ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Jurassic Park"" movies, among others. Richard Donner (""The Omen"", ""Lethal Weapon"" quadrilogy, ""Ladyhawke"", etc.) provides 8 minutes not seen in theaters, which enhance the film's exposition and moves ahead with the action. Also, the sound has been remixed and the widescreen format allows you to experience the picture the way the director wanted it. I have no idea why the two scenes that show up under 'deleted scenes' were cut from the film. The 2nd one would've been better if it had been restored into the picture, because it gives us an idea of the cruel way Lex wanted to punish Miss Tessmaucher. But, its showing up on DVD is okay.

My favorite scene is when Superman and Lois are flying over New York City, that is just beautiful. Although the film is based on a cartoon character, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5 years of age, though there might be some who'll enjoy the movie, no matter what. It would be nothing less than an insult to Christopher Reeve's memory to make ""Superman V"". The majority of people consider Christopher Reeve to be the only person who could play Superman. Memo to Warner Bros.: If you persist in making ""Superman V"", it'll be the biggest mistake you've ever done, because ""Superman"" is one of your most popular film franchises (not only yours, but in the history of movies, there has never been such a thing as a movie franchise, like the ""James Bond 007"" or ""STAR WARS"" movies that haven't gotten A TON of hype prior to its wide release). It'll be a DISASTER for you, unless you make it (if you persist on it), do what Blake Edwards did for ""Trail Of The Pink Panther"": put Lois Lane (Margot Kidder, of course) to remeniscence about Superman/Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve, showing up only in shots from the four films) before he was killed by kryptonite, making it a montage of footage from all four movies, releasing it in theaters nationwide. That would be,in my opnion, the best option if you want this franchise to end with a bang. Or, if you're thinking of continuing the series (bad idea unless you want the franchise to stink after four successful movies), you could put Dean Cain (TV's ""Lois And Clark"" and ""Clubhouse"", airing on CBS) in the role instead of another actor and release it straight to video/DVD. Do that, I think it'll go a lot better or don't make it at all. Why did the MPAA say that this movie had sensuality, even making it 'mild sensuality'? There was no sensuality in this movie and the 'mild language' was only one 'damn', one  'hell' and one 'a--'. Nothing worth mentioning. Same thing with ""STAR WARS Episode IV"", the 'brief mild language' only consisted of two 'damn's and one 'hell'. No big deal. Also, the packaging for this movie could've been better, instead of those cheap cardboard boxes. Rated PG for peril.",1097625600,3,4834,4.858181818181818
609262,5,6303212263,"The little known actor Christopher Reeve became a household name when this movie, Superman, hit the theaters.  That was about 25 years ago.  We all know of the horse incident, and now...

The story of a boy from the planet Krypton who came to Earth;  given special powers due to a different colored sun in this solar system, that's the story.

There were some great scenes in this film -- the helicopter scene, the love story with Lois Lane;  the dealings with Lex Luthor, and everyone's favorite:  the flying around the world to bring Lois back alive.

This movie spawned three sequels, of course:  part two featuring three people we met at the beginning of this movie (who were on trial);  part three, which featured my favorite comedian - Richard Pryor, and involved the story of a computer, and some oddball kryptonite which changed Superman;  and then there was part four:  where Superman disposed of the nuclear weapons on the planet, and Lex Luthor returns with his own Superman - made from the DNA in a strand of Superman's hair.

Rest in peace, Christopher Reeve...we'll miss ya.",1097539200,5,1088,4.754010695187166
609263,5,6303212263,"As soon as I heard that Christopher Reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favorite scene in ""Superman.""  This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the ""Daily Planet"" building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big ""S"" that stands for truth, justice, and the American way.  The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman.  The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film ""Superman Returns,"" and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people).  Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.

The tagline for the 1978 film ""Superman"" was that ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel.  Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent.  Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about ""Superman"" after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).

Richard Donner filmed ""Superman"" and a lot of ""Superman II"" at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think ""The Three Mustketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"").  But there is decidedly a sense in which ""Superman"" is three different films.  The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon.  The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).

However, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts.  Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell.  Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty).  No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else.  The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree.  Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humor than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way.  The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.

Watch ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" again some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role.  But to honor his memory skip the third and fourth ""Superman"" movies.  If you want more of Reeve then go check out ""Someone in Time"" (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can ""think"" yourself back in time), ""Deathtrap"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""  If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of ""Smallville"" are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.",1097452800,11,4632,4.488095238095238

We loved you as Superman, you were perhaps the only actor we would have ""bought"" in the role, both as dweeby Clark Kent and the chisel-chinned ""Man of Steel,"" and your floating over Metropolis taught us all that if we found the right love we too could fly.  You won America's heart playing the part with all the conviction and vulnerability in the world, and so when your riding accident happened we were there for you too and we cheered on your fight against immobility and pain.

You fought against government inertia and inaction, and you made ordinary people aware of the great divide between the able-bodied and the disabled, a divide that doesn't have to exist.  In some ways you were even more splendid a hero in your later years than when you were mightier than a speeding bullet.  Losing you is an event we were none of us prepared for, because I think we were all expecting one day to see you walk again, so titanic were your reserves of heroism and courage.

609265,4,6303212263,"Richard Donner's ambitious, astronomically expensive (for its time) epic gets halfway there, though nearly all of its shortcomings are purely technical.  Grappling with a story that 1978 filmmaking and effects techniques couldn't hope to deliver, it seems like a miracle the film could be made at all.  The special effects work fails to convince, and coupled with poor cutting and poorly timed, low-brow humor gives the movie a cheesy look that threatens to bury it (one can't help but wonder where all that money went).  Further still, the film is drably staged, poorly lit, and woefully inconsistant in tone (it's deadly serious one moment, dreadfully the next), bringing Donner's limitations as a director to the forefront.  By all rights, this picture should have been a disaster.  But it isn't; thanks mostly to the sheer scope of the story, the film sucks you in, and even its drab visuals and glacial pace can't seem to snap you out of it.  The Superman legend is the stuff of great mythology (the parallel between Kal-El's story and the story of Moses is uncanny), and it's all there on the screen.  Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, shines with an openness and charm that belies the God-like power his character has at his command.  Margot Kidder's hyper-feminist Lois Lane is both boorish (in a good way) and sympathetic, and Gene Hackman's cackling, Saturday morning-cartoon villain Lex Luthor always entertains you.  It all adds up to a film whose substance helps compensate for its poor form (unheard of today), and brings to life a story that was told twenty years before it should have been.  Also features Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, and Susannah York in a brief bit.",1095552000,2,1699,4.9298245614035086
609266,3,6303212263,"The historical importance of ""Superman: The Movie"" is indisputable, as a matter of fact, the importance of the character is indisputable. In the 1930s Superman was one of the earliest superheroes that came to life. In the late 1970s ""Superman: The Movie"" was the first comic-based movie, and ever since those historical landmarks, thousands of superheroes have come to life in the comics, and dozens of comic-based movies have hit the screen.

 Well, many years later, Superman (the comic) has lost a lot of its appeal with younger generations, and Superman (the movie) has dated in many areas. The performances are very solid, to be honest, only ""Batman (1989)"" can compete with ""Superman: The Movie"" in that area. But the visual effects every year look more and more dated. Obviously, a movie is much more than special effects, the most important thing in a movie is the story.

 Well, this movie tells the story of a superhero who can keep secret his identity with thick eyeglasses and changing his hairstyle, of a flying Alien that can reverse the time and events in the Earth by changing the rotation of the Planet. As you can see, the plot is very nave, but it's also very entertaining.

 The romantic idea of an almost invincible superhero might not be appealing for today's kids, because today's movies present more complex characters, like the X-Men, Batman or Spider-Man, characters that have a dark side (Batman) or represent issues like the social segregation (X-Men), or have an inner struggle between having a normal life or save people that are not thankful (Spider-Man). But to people who are 30+ years old ""Superman: The Movie"" is pure fun. By The way, ""Superman II"" is better than this movie because it actually present a vulnerable hero, he is a more complex character in the second movie, his relationship with Lois is deeper, and he faces real danger.",1091750400,,1872,4.871069182389937

 One of the best sci-fi films from the 70's, is also one of the better comic book films (only surpassed by the ""X-Men"" & ""Spider-Man"" films). Richard Donner directs a faithful big screen adaption to the popular DC Comic of the same name.

 Kryptonian peacekeeper, Jor-El has figured out that his home planet of Krypton is on a deadly collision course with its own sun. Although there is no time for a full evacuation, Big J builds a small, yet powerful, rocket placing his only son, baby boy Kal-El, safely into the rocket, launching it & sending it toward a distant planet called Earth.

 The rocket arrives, crashing into the state of Kansas, & is found by Jonathan & Martha Kent. They soon find out that Kal has extrodinary powers and decide to adopt the boy (there excuse is Kal-El is a nephew of Martha's whose parents have died) and raise him as their own. Kal gets a name change to Clark Kent & has to downplay his powers as not to draw attention. In his late teens, Clark goes on a self-discovery journey finding out who he really is and why he was brought to Earth. Enter Superman, Clark's true identity, who stands for truth, justice & the American way. His first duty is to stop, what would become his main arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor from a deadly real-estate scam.

 Richard Donner does a great job at directing (he would later go on to direct all 4 ""Lethal Weapon"" films, as well as, ""The Lost Boys""). He was offered the job after the success he had with ""The Omen"".

 The cast is truly top notch. Margot Kidder, & Christopher Reeve would go into typecasting hell because of these roles, but, I can't imagine really anyone else potraying these characters (Nicholas Cage? Ashton Kutcher? No f**king way! these guys were supposedly attached to play the new ""Superman"" that is still, as of this review, trying to get flight clearance). Gene Hackman has some of the best lines in the film thanks to Tom Mankewiez's snappy screenplay.

 The effects aren't as great as they once were (the scene where Superman stops the dam flood with the rock avalanche looks fake & some of the rear-projection flying was getting a bit old near the end). But, the image of Supe's drilling into the concrete and walking through Luthor's underground traps to get to his lair is the classic sequence from the film, as well as, Superman's flyby in space that ends the movie (that small scene is used in the other 3 ""Superman"" films as well).

 The DVD has a lot of great features, including screen tests, featurette's on the history of the film, and, what I like most of all, an isolated score track to listen to John Williams classic, legendary score, while watching the film. The film is remastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital with optional audio commentary with director and screenwriter to the film. It sounds awesome!

 I do give 2 strikes to the DVD presentation. One, the film is a two sided disk, with the feature film on side 1, with the special features on side 2. Warner should have went dual-layered with this (I hate flipper disks!). Two, the packaging is in the form of those cheap, cheesy, pain in the as* cardboard snap cases, that has become Warner Home Video's trademark claiming that its made from recycled paper and plastic (I don't care!! I want a regular DVD case, so that it fits in with the rest of my collection!!).

 Eitherway, ""Superman:The Movie"" is an indestructible film that's worth owning.",1091491200,4,3585,4.636650868878357

609339,5,6303212263,"More than a quarter of a century since it first played, absolutely NO movie in this genre compares to Superman!
This DVD version is just icing on the cake.
For exquisitely lush cinematography, to an incomparable score, to special effects that sturdily hold up 26 years later, one of the original slogans of this movie holds true to this day: ""You will believe a man can FLY!""
You don't have to be a Superman junkie to adore this movie (although I guarantee you'll become one if you watch the restored DVD version.) Richard Donner's loving and respectful take on Superman is absolutely incomparable from the first scenes - showing a child turning the pages of an Action comic (the first venue of Superman), filmed in black and white.
Superman's humble beginnings on the pages of a Depression-era comic book, to this amazing movie, is just perfection the way Donner films it.
The early days as Superman grows up are a golden tribute to the American heartland (make no mistake about it; Donner's vision of Superman isn't just about a comicbook hero, but where and how that hero fits into the American vision of this country.)
I fell in love with Glenn Ford all over again as Pa Kent (and yes, the great, handsome actor is still alive and kicking!) Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's Kryptonian birth father, is worth every penny of the more than $3 million he was paid for two weeks' work (you gotta love the SERIOUSNESS with which Brando portrays Jor-El; it just enhances the Superman mythology.)
The original Daily News building in Manhattan plays home to the Daily Planet. Lots of shots of 1978 New York in this flick, including the World Trade Center merrily blinking in the background as Superman takes Lois Lane for a nighttime spin through the Manhattan skyline.
Margot Kidder is phenomenal as Lois, transformed here as a go-getter reporter who can't spell for beans but who loves a good tabloid story full of murder and mayhem. Jackie Cooper does a great turn as Perry White, urging his reporters to nab an inteview with the Man of Steel as the greatest thing ""since God talked to Moses.""
Next to Glenn Ford, I have to say that Gene Hackman's portrayal of Lex Luther - the self-described ""greatest criminal mind of our time!"" - is just amazingly funny. Ned Beatty as the doofy Otis, following around ""Mister Lootor,"" is a superb second banana. Valerie Perrine does one of her best jobs as Hackman's moll, Miss Tessmocker.
Then we come to Chris Reeve. All I can say is that most actors would give their eyeteeth and right arm to be able to have a role like this in their resume. Reeve is simply superb - he was BORN to be Superman. He approaches the role with seriousness and a bit of wry humor. It's safe to say that this is HIS role; no other actor will ever come close to approaching the job he does.
I can't watch this movie without being a kid again, seeing it in a theatre with my parents, screaming and applauding and cheering, and being absolutely blown away by the entire way it was done.
Add this DVD to your collection. If you're like me, you will want to introduce your own kids to the movie that truly made you believe ""a man can fly.""

609340,5,6303212263,"The 1978 film Superman (and its companion piece, Superman II, more a continuation of the first film than a sequel) is, simply, the greatest film adaptation of a comic book character ever. The film is not without flaws, but is essential viewing.
It is that for a number of reasons. First is the loving and respectful adaptation of Superman, who is now more than a comic book character. Superman is an archetype, a myth, a folk hero. He is to us Americans what Hercules was to the Greeks, or Sir Lancelot to the English. The makers of this film actually *understood* this, and worked *with* and not *against* the mythic power of the character. (It sounds simple enough, but a generation of filmmakers afterward have failed to grasp the importance of this basic concept.)
Kudos to writer Tom Mankiewicz for taking Superman seriously. Kudos to director Richard Donner, whose work on this film may occasionally clunk along rather than soar, but whose understanding of what makes Superman truly heroic never falters. Kudos to Gene Hackman, for offering us the seemingly impossible--a lovable Lex Luthor. (You'd be laughing right along with this guy, even as he dropped a nuke on your house.)
Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth and the special effects team. The effects hold up surprisingly well after all this time. The truth is, Superman was never a quantum leap forward in effects the way, say, Star Wars or The Abyss were. The genius of this film was, and is, to emply a variety of effects--wires, bluescreen, miniatures, animation--to depict the same scene, then quick cut from one to the other. The viewer was, and is, usually not given enough time with any one effect to figure out how it's done. The eye is fooled into accepting the vision.
There is real magic here, but it didn't come from the special effects lab. It came from the heart and soul of Christopher Reeve, who plays both Superman and Clark Kent to perfection. In the end, it is Reeve that makes the movie credible, who makes you care. Check out the scene in Lois Lane's apartment where Reeve changes from Clark Kent to Superman and back again in a matter of seconds. There're no special effect at work, just Reeve using his voice and his body. That, my young friends, is what we used to call ""acting.""

The wonderful midwestern landscapes of this film are still as beautiful now as they were then (I think they were shot in Canada, if memory serves correctly), and are in my view WAY underrated.  It took twelve years (Dances With Wolves) before the plains were shot this way again.
I also remember the big hub-bub about Marlon Brando's salary for this film...Brando's performance is very good and just reinforces why he is one of the all time greats.

My 10 and 12 year olds enjoyed watching it with us and enjoyed the story.
The performances are all pretty good.  Margot Kidder never looked better and Christopher Reeve really became and embodied Superman.  He had all the right qualities.  One of the interesting things is noticing all the actors you had forgotten were in this movie and remembering where else you have seen them or heading over to IMDB and looking them up.

I had a crush on Christopher Reeve for years. I never got enough of these films. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I bought the DVD this weekend and it was worth every penny.
Superman will always be a classic film experience. With three sequels, this film was a blockbuster alongside Star Wars and Return of the Jedi.  It's the perfect 80's experience and if you are an eighties kid I suggest you relive those moments by buying all of the Superman films.  I admit it was very sad to watch since Christopher is now confined to a wheelchair for life. I couldn't keep my mind off of his ailment while watching the film. It was sad to think of the eighties and how fast time pasts but this is what makes this movie wonderful...memories.
This film is not perfect by all means.  The dialoge is wacky. The special effects are cheap ( but back then they were amazing ). People not used to the film will only concentrate on its faults but it has so much more to offer. It will forever be a classic and one of the most romantic series ever made.  No matter how old or dated these Superman films get it will always be remembered. Not even the upcoming Hollywood remake can change that.  This touched the hearts of millions for over twenty years.

Those Extras:
Commentary:  Dang, they just missed.  Donner and (uncredited) scriptwriter Mankiewicz fill us in for nearly two and half hours, but I still went away somewhat unsatisfied.  Unfortunately Donner is a would-be jokester, and needs too much prompting from Mankiewicz on how a scene was done.  Rarely does Donner offer how an effect was achieved, which this DVD would especially be made for.  So many stunts with plenty to tell, but only half of the great shots are explained.
Behind the Scenes:  WOW.  Not one, not two, but three different half hour looks at how things were put to film.  Hosted by Marc ""Jimmy Olsen"" McClure, everything you could want to know about the flying effects or whatever is answered.  Though it would've been fun if they included the double-documentary produced in 1982 hosted by Reeve that TBS used to air (glad I taped it back then :)).
New Interviews:  Awesome.  Sure, Kidder, Donner, Mankiewicz, and an archived Brando are here, but even Reeve in his current unfortunate state, and Gene Hackman!
Deleted Scenes:  Total fun.  The original two and a half hour cut is pieced together here, but also included in a deleted scenes only section.
Screen Tests:  Damn amazing.  To see not only a long haired, skinnier Reeve, but all the actresses who didn't get the part of Lois!!  Anne Archer, Leslie Ann Warren, among others.  For those who care, Ursa, the female villian of part 2, is read for by various ladies as well.
Isolated Music Score:  Well, for lovers of this score such as myself, this is a real treat.  Out of print CDs are no longer needed to be hunted down, heh heh.
Overall:  I feel so bad, only giving this four stars.  So much care was put into it, but lack of bloopers---one of my favorite supplements---are not included.  But that's a very small carp to a wonderful DVD offering.",1066608000,2,1921,4.72289156626506

We all know the story-I don't think it's neccescary going into details of the film. The added scenes are a plus. I think the little girl on the train(who turns out to be little Lois Lane)is a very significant scene. She sees superman run home from school and tries to tell her parents what she saw. A short but important scene-because it adds more drama to the romance later in the film.
I have a message for Warner Brothers: Put out the director's cut. I don't care how long the film is. I think that you should take full advantage of the capablties of the DVD format.
The 3 documentries provide a lot of insights on how the film was made.",1053043200,3,877,4.226190476190476
609415,5,6303212263,"Considering the proliferation of films based on comic book heroes (and anti-heroes) in recent years, it's hard to recall that this 1978 adaptation of the Superman comic strip and icon of Americana was a monumental gamble for the producers, the director, and its distributor, Warner Bros.  The last major DC comic book character to hit the silver screen had been Batman, in 1966, but that movie -- although fun to watch -- had the same campy approach to the Caped Crusader that the then-current TV series on ABC had.  Warner Bros., which owned DC Comics and the rights to Superman, feared that a campy Superman film would flop.  So for years, the idea lingered in limbo. Indeed, had it not been for the vision of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, Warner Bros. might never had made Superman: The Movie at all.
But the story of how Superman made it to the big screen is not for this reviewer to tell...although it is available in this wonderful DVDs extra features as part of the behind-the-scenes documentaries on the flip side of the single disc.
What I can say about this Superman DVD is that of the four movies in the series, this first one is the best.  Yes, the special effects are a bit dated by our CGI-dominated 2003 standards, but for the late 1970s these mostly hand-crafted visuals were eye-popping and wow-inducing.  But effects alone do not make a good movie; Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman's smart, fast-paced script, Richard Donner's steady direction, Geoffrey Unsworth's fine cinematography, and John Williams' wonderful score combine with great visuals and interesting performances by such cast members as Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Reeve. (I can't say enough about Reeve's acting: in essence, he plays Clark Kent very differently from Kal-El/Superman.)
This DVD (which was released almost 2 years ago) presents Superman: The Movie in its full widescreen glory and with a crisp and clear transfer from film to digital.  The movie itself is about eight minutes longer than the theatrical or VHS versions; the studio allowed Donner to restore material cut from the 1978 release version (but later seen on its ABC TV presentation).  I personally don't know if that was really necessary, but I don't object violently to it, either.  The sound quality is good, although since I don't have a home theater type sound system I can't claim to be an expert on the quality of Dolby Surround or stuff like that. It sounds good on my TV, that's all I can say for that aspect of the DVD.
The extra features are also good. While the audio commentary is not as focused on technology used in the shooting of the movie, Richard Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankeweicz do provide some fascinating insights into the movie and its cast.  Furthermore, they have good speaking voices and never bore you to death.  Another nifty feature (for John Williams fans) is a music-only track that allows you to watch this movie as a two-hour-plus music video.  The other extra features -- documentaries, screen tests, trailers, and additional music cues -- are on the B side of the disc.
My only complaint is Warner Home Video's mostly-cardboard DVD cases and the double-sided DVD....one has to handle both with extra gentle care to avoid damaging either the package or the DVD.
One additional note: The only other Superman movie (until the 21st Century feature is made and released) worth buying is Superman II.  It is one of the few sequels of a good movie worth seeing, and this is in part because it was being made simultaneously with Superman I. (The original script by Puzo was so large it could be -- and was -- split into two movies.)  The other two movies in the franchise fell into the bad-sequel-to-a-great-movie pit so common in Hollywood.",1053043200,3,3757,4.833333333333333
609416,5,6303212263,"Yes, that's right. DO NOT buy any other movie in the Superman Saga besides this one.
Why?
Because it's the only one that actually takes full advantage of DVD's higher image quality.
For those of you who still haven't seen this film even 25 years after its original theatrical run, it's a very simple story. Superman (or Kal-El) is the last survivor of the planet Krypton, sent to Earth to help us with our problems--renegade nuclear missiles, evil geniuses and muggers.
If you have owned any copy of the film previous to this release, you will be amazed. Completely remastered for a theatrical release that never took place, it sounds and looks even better than it did in 1978.
Even more interesting is the audio commentary featuring director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant (a Salkind euphemism for screenwriter) Tom Mankiewicz, as well as two making-of featurettes which finally reveal more about the tensions between Donner and the Salkinds which resulted in his firing from ""Superman II""--which took Mankiewicz, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and composer John Williams with him, and almost scuttled the project when Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder threatened to quit as well.
In short, don't waste your money on the other three DVDs in the saga; this is the only one worth owning.

There will never be a ""family"" like this one again who came together and created magic in filmmaking. This film is not about special effects. It's an actor's, director's, and cinematographer's film. The writing is unmatched (especially when you compare it to the other Superman films), and the performances are powerful, innocent, charming, and original. Christopher Reeve is THE reason for watching this movie. He was born to play the character. What made his performance so perfect (besides his good lucks, charm and acting talent) was that he purposely underplayed the characters, especially Superman. There will never be another Man of Steel, on film or in real life, like Chris.
I was research consultant on the DVD restoration (see my name as the last credit in the documentaries), and what an honor and thrill it was to be involved in such a fun and exciting project. I was extremely pleased with the results. I saw the remaster projected in San Antonio in March 2001 and was blown away. It definitely looked and sounded superior to what I remember in 1978. I sent about 100 pounds of photos and promotional items to Warner Bros. for consideration in the documentaries/supplemental section of the DVD. A lot was used, however, a stills gallery was rejected because WB wanted to stay with a one disc, dual-sided DVD package. I decided to create the CapedWonder website to showcase the images that didn't make it on the DVD. Check it out sometime.
To all who made this wonderful film from March 1977 to October 1978, and to those who remastered it in 2000 and 2001...Thank You! I believe...

And, yes, technically, the movie is incomplete;  the plot isn't finished until we get through Superman II (Superman and Superman II are really two-halves of the same movie).  Still, this movie continues to outshine every other comic-book movie made since (including Spiderman) and for a very simple reason.  In making the film, director Richard Donner always insisted upon what he called ""verisimilitude"", that is to say, a movie that was ""true to life.""  Unlike so many other comic-books that get turned into movies this one takes its main subject seriously.  It never gives in to the temptation to parody itself.  That's why it works. Chris Reeve looks like he stepped right out of a Curt Swan-drawn Superman illustration and John William's music is nothing less than a cultural landmark:  heroic, soaring, emotional, glorious.  William's main theme for Superman is simply the greatest musical cue ever written for a character.  Once it is heard, it is indelibly imprinted in the listener's mind.  Having heard it, it is impossible to associate the character with any other musical signature.  This is the greatest score ever written by a great composer.

How can you not enjoy Lex yelling ""MS. TESSMACHER!!!!"" or Williams amusing musical cues for Beatty's character?

609496,3,6303212263,"Fond memories of being enthralled by this 1978 blockbuster on its original release prompted me to buy this DVD. Alas, not only has the movie's lustre dimmed--does anything you like at age 18 hold up a quarter-century later?--but the DVD package doesn't even manage to make it seem more momentous than it is.
First, my view of the movie nearly a quarter-century after first seeing it: Although my nostalgic fondness for it holds up, it doesn't seem as filling a box of popcorn now. Nothing wrong with the basic arc of the story (the origins of Superman, and his first adventures as a caped crimefighter), and this probably is still the best movie built around a comic-book character. But the campy tone in the Metropolis and Lex Luthor sequences undercuts the sense of wonder the movie was aiming for. Christopher Reeve's performance as the Man of Steel seems just right--earnest, but with a sense of humor and a disarming modesty. However, the movie's Lex Luthor--Gene Hackman, who can be spine-tingling as a villain (see ""Unforgiven"")--seems to be in a different movie. The labored ""comic"" byplay between Lex Luthor and his dim-witted henchman Otis (the normally fine Ned Beatty) seems to have been acted in slow motion. The movie's production values haven't aged too well, so in many shots Superman's ""flying"" ability seems less convincing than that of the winged monkeys in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" made almost 65 years ago.
As for the DVD: They've generally done a pretty spiffy job of remastering the sound (for one thing, John Williams' score--not his finest, yet appropriately heraldic--no longer sounds as though it was recorded in an echo chamber), but the picture quality seems more grainy than it did in the theatrical release (even though they did color-correct a few blue-screen shots where Superman's costume looked GREEN in the movie's original release). The extras aren't all that enthralling, either, although they have their moments.
But my main complaint is the ""Special Edition"" format. For those who'd like to watch the movie as it was originally released, too bad. Either you have to put up with 20 or so minutes of added scenes (which by themselves aren't of much consequence--and what is worse, they're clumsily inserted, breaking up the flow of a movie that already suffers from uneven pacing), or you stick with the VHS version. There's no option of choosing between the original, released cut and the longer ""Special Edition,"" as you get with the ""T2"" DVD set (or the new ""E.T."" release). Director Richard Donner has gone on record as saying that his ""director's cut"" was the 142-minute theatrical version, not this (which doesn't even incorporate all of the ""missing"" footage that network-TV broadcasts reinstated years ago).",1035158400,2,2748,5.0285087719298245
609497,5,6303212263,"For a film made in 1978, this movie looks brand new on DVD, I was really impressed, this is by far the best comic-book adaption ever, director Richard Donner really brought human emotion to th character of Superman, the film begins on Krypton where three villians are cast into space for crimes(villians of ""Superman II), Marlon Brando stars as Jor-El,a scientist who knows Krypton's fate is at hand, knowing this he dispatches his son to outer space for his journey to earth just before Krypton's destruction, once there his son Ka-el is found by a childless couple who take him as their own, the film the proceeds with Ka-el better known as Clark Kent as a teenager who discovers he has unlimited powers, after his adopted father dies, he is lured into the family barn where a mystical crystal has called to him, a crystal that echoes his roots, he soon leaves & delivers it to an isolated area in an iced region, where it builds his fortress & where he discovers his true identity, the film soon takes us to Metropolis where Kent is a reporter, we soon meet Lex Luthor(Gene Hackman) who has a plan for California that involves earthquakes, a freak accident involving Lois Lane brings out the hero in Clark Kent where Superman is revealed for the first time, aware of his existence Luthor attempts to destroy Superman so he can proceed with his plan, but his plan fails, & soon after Superman is chasing missles that Luthor has rigged to hit California, the missle chase is awesome where you see determination in Reeve's eyes, who does a wonderful job as Superman, the earthquake in California is intense as Superman attempts to stop its destruction, this was a well made film that had a very good sequel & is one of the best DVD's around, with added scenes such as Luthor's lair that Reeve enters, as he tries to take out Superman with machine guns, fire, & snow & ice, which have no effect, a great scene that is somewhat comical, the best Superman period!!!",1033171200,,1962,4.624641833810888

609570,2,6303212263,"I understand that many people who like this movie regard it as a classic, and they grew up on it. Heck, their kids probably grew up on it too. However for me it was quite different. I first saw this movie when I was about 8 I belive, and it didn't manage to keep my interest, and I fell asleep. I didn't remember any of it, until I decided to rent it a month or two ago on DVD. I had low expectations due to my boring memories of it and the fact that it was made in 1978. My low expectations were justified. This movie doesn't stand up to modern comic book flicks like Spider-Man and X-Men. Christopher Reeve plays Superman, who, unfortunately, is wearing tights, wich are, to put it delicately, tight. Perhaps too tight in some spots. Margot Kidder plays Lois Lane, howerver her performance comes across as ""flakey"". One might go as far as to use the word ""dingbat"". Gane Hackman play Supeman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor. Unfortunately, I found his character to be the worst of all (second to Ned Beatty's ""Otis""). It is impossible to take him seriousely. He does not come across as dangerouse, powerful, or even threataning. Hackman more or less plays him like a big joke. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the animated Superman cartoon from the 90's and the new show ""Smallville"" on The WB, but Hackman's Lex just doesn't work for me. Casting issues aside, the movie has a rather weak story. Basically it's written to accomidate as many special effects as possible. Rather than the special effects working for the story, the story works for the special effects. The story is very simple, obviousely geared towards kids, and when Superman uses his powers, it's almost always just to show off the special effect. The special effects were very good for '78, however that doesn't excuse how they used them for no other purpose than to ""wow"" the audience. Also, if this movie takes place in Metropolis, why do we constantly see new york landmarks? It's not accidental either. They intentionally flaunt images of the Statue of Liberty and the now fallen Twin Towers in our faces. Obviousely the director couldn't make up his mind where the movie takes place. In the end, you have a movie for young children, with production values up the wazoo (things like the Kryptonian counsil at the start and the earthquake climax were well done, but unfortuately wasted by the rest of the film), with a half baked story. If you can call it baked at all. This movie ranks in fourth place in the superhero flicks I've seen.
1. X-men, an excellent re-envisioning of the comic.
2. Spider-Man, however I actually would have it tied with X-Men.
3. Batman, wich I place in third, however I think it had bad casting (Micheal Keaton?) and low production values.
4. Superman, wich places fourth, right below Batman. A kid's film with high production values and no story.
I seriousely hope that Superman's new film will turn out better than his '78 attempt. Superman was never my favorite superhero, but I think that since he launched the genre, he at least deserves a film that ranks up there with Brian Synger's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.",1032393600,4,3110,4.656363636363636

Christopher Reeve will forever be remembered as The Man of Steel, and his performance as Clark Kent/Superman is very well handled as he brought some humanity to the character.

609574,3,6303212263,"The imagery and soundtrack of this DVD are wonderful.
However, in the early '80s Superman The Movie was broadcast for television here in Australia and was about 177 minutes long. This is nearly three hours. The two ""deleted"" scenes found in the ""Special Edition"" were actually included in the television broadcast. These two deleted scenes I refer to as the ""Feed the babies Otis"" scene and the scene when Lex is playing piano while singing ""You must have been a beautiful baby"" as Otis lowers Miss Tessmocker who is to be the next meal for the ""babies"". Superman saves her of course.
Much of the humour in the relationship between Lex, Otis and Miss Tessmocker is lost because the DVD is missing so many shots/scenes.
The only scene I noticed on the DVD that was not in the '80s television broadcast is a short scene where we see some people looking at the lastest news reports on some TVs in a shop window.
...
All in all, I have to say that I expected more footage, and not less, in a so-called ""Special Edition"" version of Supmerman and I was most disappointed. I feel as though I have been short-changed.

609577,5,6303212263,"Richard Donner's 1978 film SUPERMAN has to be one of the most misunderstood films of all time. In an age where it's ""hip"" to deconstruct superhero characters and make them grim-n-gritty and/or vapid teen idols, the movie can't help but come off as a valentine to a bygone era. And with the advent of SMALLVILLE and a proposed new Superman movie (in which producer Jon Peters and his crew have been trying for the past 10 years to radically alter everything about the character except the name), even Superman fans have taken to bashing Donner's film, sneering at it as being ""campy,"" too reverential of the source material, and too ""dated.""
And yet...nothing could be further from the truth. Far from being ""dated,"" SUPERMAN is just as fresh and timely today as it was 24 years ago, and the spectacular digital restoration (including a new sound FX track-the original had deteriorated) makes the movie look just as fresh and new as the latest box-office hits. Even more impressive is how the special effects have held up; except for three brief front-projection shots, you can still believe a man can fly. I can only imagine that the ""dated"" claims have to do with the film being 24 years old and having been made before CGI and choppy MTV-style editing came into use, because there's nothing else about the film that dates it to the 1970s. (Do yourselves a favor and watch the 3 documentaries on the DVD. They give incredible insight into how much work was put into the film.)
And then there's the script, by Tom Mankiewicz (credited to Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton). When producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind first developed the project, they intended it to be a camp comedy. When Donner and Mankiewicz came aboard, the film was altered into a serious piece, and the end result is magical. We're given an epic depiction of the origin of Superman, beginning with the Krypton holocaust, going thru his childhood in Smallville, and finally ending up in Metropolis where the adult Superman faces his first trial-by-fire in his encounter with Lex Luthor. The story has plenty of humor in it, but it's still played straight, and runs the entire gamut of emotions. The oft-criticized ending, in which Lois dies in an earthquake and a grieving Superman defies his oath to not interfere with human history by flying back in time to save her, is the defining character moment for Superman. In defying the orders of his father and following his heart, Superman rejects his alien heritage and embraces his humanity. It's a great moment, but yet it's one that too many people are quick to bash because ""he can save anybody that way."" They don't see what it really means as a character bit. Making the story even stronger is Donner's taut, reverent direction, as well as some truly great acting. Christopher Reeve IS Clark Kent/Superman, body and soul (his own size mirrors the physical stats of the comic book character). Playing the role with heart and conviction, Reeve literally becomes the character made flesh. Marlon Brando, in his small role as Jor-El, is also excellent, bringing a commanding dignity to film. Gene Hackman's sociopathic Luthor, a guy who merrily jokes and brags about himself while planning an act of genocide simply to make big real estate money, is both funny and chilling. Add to this knockout trio fine performances by an international cast of superstars, and the film comes alive. Also of note is the powerful score by John Williams. Those condemn this score as being ""too heroic"" need to have their hearing checked. Williams delivers more than just heroism; he captures the eerie ambiance of Krypton, the rural warmth of Smallville, and the romanticism and tragedy of Superman and Lois' relationship beautifully. And to cap it all off, he gives Superman one of the most unforgettable fanfares in film history. Further strengthening the film is Stuart Baird's brisk, punchy editing; John Barry's lavish production designs (including the memorable crystalline Krypton); Yvonne Blake's clever costuming (the glowing Krypton costumes, and a flawless rendering of Superman's classic suit); and Geoffrey Unsworth's misty, ethereal cinematography, which enhances the fairy tale aspects of the character. Every step of the way, the film successfully brings Superman and his world to life.
That said, SUPERMAN has its flaws. Ned Beatty's Otis character is mostly a non-entity; he doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. And Margot Kidder is badly miscast as Lois; not only is she far too tomboyish to play what in the comics is a glamorous character, but she comes off more like Reeve's vapid sister than she does a feisty love interest. Their scenes only work because Reeve makes us buy into the movie. Watching the screen test for Anne Archer-a much better and much better-looking actress, I can't help wondering why she wasn't cast as Lois instead. She would have been perfect opposite Reeve. (But to be fair to Kidder, she was way better than most of the other actresses tested-Stockard Channing in particular was awful.) And there's a really careless glitch when Superman saves Air Force One; the film is reversed when he grabs the plane, so his emblem and spit-curl are both backwards. But in the end, those flaws aren't enough to weaken SUPERMAN's impact. It was and still is not only the best comic book movie ever, but it's also one of the finest films ever made, period. Those who bash the classic version of Superman and this film while supporting the planned Jon Peters version should definitely reconsider their stance. This is not an inept drek-fest like BATTLEFIELD EARTH, nor is it a heartless, soulless mess like the Peters film promises to be. This is a beautiful, heartfelt piece of Americana, crafted with love and respect. SUPERMAN deserves to be seen as the classic it is, not to be disrespected and forgotten.",1021334400,3,5877,4.9313824419778

609635,5,6303212263,"Back in the late seventies, it was very easy to be derisive of Superman. Brando's outlandish fee, the sledgehammer marketing and the film's own pompousness- not least in delaying the appearance of its title character for a whole hour- made it stick in the craw for many people.
But for children, innocent of such things, it was a tremendous, uplifting experience. I remember leaving the cinema and instantly punching the air in the full belief that I too could streak into the sky. And I know I'm not the only one.
Seeing the film now, it's possible to make sense of both responses. Now that it has dated badly, its commercial exigencies are all too apparent, and more than once come close to knackering the narrative (see any scene with Brando in it).

However, the film is still bursting with charm. The cornfield Smallville sequence and yappy Metropolis are extremely well realised, and take life from a raft of quality performances.
Central is the casting masterstroke of Christopher Reeve, whose sensitive reading of the role is about as perfectly judged as they get. His Clark Kent is a klutzy fish out of water, but it's the way he lets that vulnerability seep into his Man of Steel that makes it a performance to cherish. The effect is this: Superman has the looks and powers of a god, but he's also an outsider who just wants to be loved.
Honours also go to John Williams for one of his most inspired scores, one that fully justifies its lengthy showcase during the bombastic title sequence.
The new release is excellent, with a much-improved soundtrack and supplementary materials that enrich the experience rather than just prolong it. Like the best DVDs, the documentaries and lively commentary provide an illuminating insight into the passions and struggles involved in making films, and recommend it as an essential buy, not only for fans of this film, but for everybody who loves the movies.",1014768000,,1906,4.82874617737003

Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast as the man of steel who parts from his father (Marlon Brando) and is transported to Earth to fight evil.  Gene Hackman is devilishly good as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder shows spunk and verve as Lois Lane.

Plus, the features are a real treat, including a few featurettes, and the original trailers, which show how long a way we've come in marketing films.

609639,5,6303212263,"As we all know, Superman is larger than life.  He flies, he lifts battleships, he sees through walls, he protects the innocent.  He is a true American hero.  Created by immigrants in the early 20th century, Superman has been through countless recreations and revisions.  Even today, with the TV show Smallville, we are constantly trying to update and dig deeper into this character,  trying to relate to him more, and at the same time idolize him for his ideas and purity.  When Richard Donner and the Producers of this movie started working on Superman, they knew bringing this character to the screen would require a great challenge just in the realm of believability.  Getting a man to fly would be tough, and getting him to look real was going to be tougher.  The amazing thing is, Donner brought him to life in so many other ways as well.  Christopher Reeve plays the lead character with heart and purpose.  Donner made sure we felt something as this boy becomes a man and then moves on to start saving the world.  He does not stand as a chest-forward, pompous powerhouse that puts his ego or well being above anyone else.  Reeve is superb as Clark Kent and Superman.  No one could ever believe that a man who only wears glasses and slouches could hide the fact that he is the same man who dropped a boat full of bank robbers in front of the police station.  But Reeve does it, unbelievably he does it.  Donner is a great director, handling films after this such as all four Lethal Weapon movies, Conspiracy Theory and Maverick.  He directed most of the second Superman movie, but you can tell someone else took over by the looser handling of the picture.  This movie stands out above all the others though.  The chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder, who plays Lois Lane, is incredible.  Both of them have to switch gears in their characters, Reeve obviously between Kent and Superman, and Kidder between the tough reporter and the love sick woman who can't stand to be around Superman without blushing at everything he says.  Both performances are pulled off expertly.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as Lex Luthor, the greatest criminal mind of our time.  He portrays Luther as he should, a man of the mind, not a man of violence.  This is why Luthor is Superman's arch enemy, he is brilliant.  Superman on the other hand, although smart, cannot be stopped by physical means, but cannot stop Luthor if on some levels he chooses to use tactics that are too far reaching, as he does in this movie.

The first half of the movie is pretty much the same as the old video and TV releases of the movie.  The extra bit at the start with Marlon Brando is OK, but I think that you see most of that in Superman II anyway(?).
The second half of the movie is really poor.  It suffers from being extremely disjointed.  The missile heists, in particular, are cut down to only a few minutes.  The final grabbing of Lex Luthor and Otis by the Man of Steel does not happen - one second you're looking at Lois Lane in the desert, a quick cut to Superman flying, then all of a sudden it's night and Superman is flying into a prison with a villain under each arm.

Surprisingly clean, the careful transfer of this 23 year-old film to DVD is a lovely sight. The Dolby 5.1 audio track sings, and the music of John Williams, featured by itself on one of the audio tracks, is as powerful as the main character.
There are plenty of additional features to enjoy, including screen tests, special effects tests, and an enjoyable commentary throughout by director Richard Donner.
The movie has some shortcomings- Margot Kidder was roundly criticized for playing Lois Lane, as one reviewer wrote in 1978, ""like a reformed hooker.""

Then a couple of new scenes are restored revolving the decision of the council to decide what penality Jor-El should face. Jor-El decides he must send Kal-El his only son to earth, and he does. After that the Krypton sun approaches Krypton even more and the planet expldes. When the small star like vessel is traveling he happens to pass by the Kryptonite criminals in the glass spining off (we'll see them again Superman II). He crash lands on earth somewhere in Kansas and is adopted by childless couple who offer him much love even though they knew his powers.

After his adoptive father dies he discovers the green crystal in the farm from which he Jor-El sent along with discovers he must leave and find out who he really is. He heads of somewhere cold and throws the crystal far out and somehow the crystals start to build and becomes what is known as Fortress of Soltitude. He discover's his real father and the his birth place as well. Soon enough the second half is what you'll never forgot. The much older Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) works at The Daily Planet and meets Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) his love interest. Whenever Superman reveals himself to the public he's a superhero and quite unbelievable. But he meets his most unforgettable foe to Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Its up to Superman to stop the madman and saves the people he cares about. This movie is Unforgettable never without the doubt Christopher Reeve made us believe Superman can fly, he make a perfect resemblance to Superman, and his acting is quite excellent he was made for this roll. Gene Hackman is great as the sadistic criminal mastermind Lex Luthor a performance sure to please. Thumbs up as well for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane she is quite the actress for her role. Marlon Brando's role as Jor-El was short but none the less he was great in the character. The DVD is marvelous its in Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 the way it should be the picture is best watched when your in the dark you can see the bright color off of Superman's uniform.

609705,4,6303212263,"Before you watch this movie, tell yourself these three things;
 1.  Its a comic and some escapacism is allowed due to the fact that the movie perfectly captures and places us in real time to make us feel Superman exists.  I don't think any action adventure comic movie will get any closer than that.
 2.  I was a kid when it came out, and was too fascinated to notice any, even the most obvious, fumbly tricks of the trade.
 3.  This was a movie made before computers. It has a more of a depth feeling to the movie as if everything has mass, emotion, movement and inertia instead of a flat, click and drag feel to it.
  Not yet, maybe many more years from now, I think this movie will be looked at as a masterpiece because it was created by people who used their skill and dug out their creative ideas which is now done with the help of computers.  The movie was set in 1978 and the quality made it revolutionary to this day.
  I originally wanted to set it at 3.5 stars. Flying against the city drop backs didn't match--this may have been from the better digital quality of the DVD which made the differences more obvious. Also because fast reaction scenes where the cameras were speeded up were more obvious, and towards the end the movie seemed to jumped through plots, but in the special features this reason is explained.  Which is why I rated it four stars--I'll just say the special features is pretty cool.",1003536000,,1414,4.392307692307693
609706,5,6303212263,"No, I don't mean that ""Superman"" is a bad movie - on the contrary, it's brilliant.  I mean that the REASON it has held up so well is the trouble Richard Donner had to go through to complete it.

""Superman"" has all of the warning signs of a crappy big-budget bomb: multiple rewrites (and numerous writers), producer interference, eccentric actors, and special effect delays.

But....

Tom Mankiewicz, the ""creative consultant"" was able to pull off a believable script with snappy dialog and a reasonable suspension of disbelief.

Richard Donnner wisely chose believability over camp, a risky choice that helps ""Superman"" sustain itself 30 years later.

Marlon Brando's behavioral (and payroll) quirks didn't end up consigning the film to the camp category, and helped redefine Jor-El (but his loss is disastrous for the original ""Superman II"")

John Williams created an iconic score recognizable where others are forgotten.

The director's commentary with Richard and Tom outline the difficulties in pulling this film together.  The end result is a vision of ""Superman"" that went beyond the source material to a point where the movie's themes become intertwined with future print and film versions (i.e. the vision of Krypton as a cold, crystalline place).  Apparently the stress of pulling it together brought the production through the crucible to make a shining, iconic superhero film.

609711,5,6303212263,"The late 70s and early 80s was such a fantastic time to be a kid at the movies - the experience of seeing of ""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters"", ""E.T."" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on the big screen was exciting beyond words.  For me, though, one movie from that period stands a head and (broad) shoulders above the rest: Richard Donner's ""Superman: The Movie"".
Warner Brothers deserves applause for their TLC lavished on this previously-neglected classic.  Begone with the murky, faded pan & scan abominations - we now have a pristine, colorful transfer that finally restores Geoffrey Unsworth's gorgeous widescreen cinematography.  And if that wasn't enough, we also have 9 extra minutes of (quality) footage, trailers, deleted scenes, screen tests (yeah!) and three new documentaries to boot.
And for Superman fans like me, the documentaries and screen tests are a treasure to behold.  Thank God for Richard Donner - it's scary to think what ""Superman: The Movie"" could've been without his reverent, loving vision of the comic-book legend.  The new interviews with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder are insightful and often hilarious...  Ms. Kidder, in particular, is a delight.  It's impossible to imagine anyone else as the Daily Planet's intrepid reporter.  Three cheers to Lynn Stalmaster for his dead-on casting!
Although it would've been nice to see a special edition of ""Superman II"" as a companion, I certainly won't complain.  I'm just happy that 20+ years later, ""Superman: The Movie"" is just as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it in theaters.  From the destruction of Krypton, to the famous helicopter rescue, to the earthquake-disaster climax, ""Superman"" is a marvelous piece of cinema (and American pop culture, for that matter).

Granted- not when you hired the movie out on VHS. Secondly, the two scenes with Lex luthers 'babies' were integrated into it when it screened on Australian T.V. On the DVD its put onto a section called 'deleted scenes'. How can they be 'deleted' if I remember seeing them as a kid. Why couldn't they have been remastered and integrated into the film!

609810,5,6303212263,"Considering how hard it seems for directors, producers & screenwriters to come up with a decent comic book screen adaptation, Richard Donner and company make it look so easy to do with Superman.  By far the best movie based on a comic book, Superman gives us a wonderful story that's both entertaining and heartwarming as it is loyal to the comic book purists who hate when Hollywood takes their favorite comic book heroes and turns them into something completely different.
Christopher Reeve was born to play this role, and to me (and millions of others out there) his Superman is the ""Definative Superman"" that all others will be judged by.  He's exactly how we perceive Superman to be: Logical, strong, sensitive, enduring, with a heart of gold and so on.  He is also the real reason to see the last two Superman movies.  You can say what you want about the movies themselves, but you can't say that he's not good in them, because he is.  I paticularly enjoyed the added scene in this film after he's saved Lois Lane from falling out of the helicopter (and other assorted tasks) and goes back to the fortress of solitude where he converses with his father (Marlon Brando) of how good it felt and that he couldn't help himself.  Jor-El (Brando) tells him not to be hard on himself, but to be mindful of his vanity, for it was vanity that destroyed the Kryptonians.  Finally, Jor-El tells his son how much he wishes he could hug him and Superman reaches his arms out to him as he disappears.  I really liked that.  He has never (and will never) be able to hug his Dad and there's a true feeling of saddness about this that rings true.  I can't believe scenes like this were cut from the original release, especially the ""Gauntlet"" sequence when Superman goes underground to hunt for Lex Luthor and gets hit by machine guns, masses amounts of fire, as well as cold freeze before finally reaching the entrance of the evil geniuses secret lair.  Never should've been cut!
I learned a lot from this DVD.  I was very shocked to learn that Alexander & Ilya Salkind hired Richard Donner to direct Superman & Superman II (as a two picture deal) and then fired him after the first film went on to become a huge success.  Apparantly it was due to creative differences, but I think they made a huge mistake when they fired him.  I'd go so far to say that Superman III & IV would've been hits, had Donner went on to direct the enire series himself.  He would've looked at the script for part III and said, ""This is terrible!  Are you trying to destroy the franchise?!"".  A special note to readers: Richard Donner did in fact direct scenes for Superman II, and had it not been for the fact that the original Superman had gone over budget causing part II to be delayed, he may have actually finished the whole thing himself.  What a pity that we'll never get to see what the Donner/Superman Saga would've been like.",993945600,3,2902,4.526819923371647

The movie itself - a nearly-unmatched fete of cinematic excellence - was astonishing when it was released. And it has weathered two decades very well. The effects are still awesome, while the plot itself manages to deftly swing from suspense, drama, comedy and action under the underrated direction of Richard Donner. John Williams' score is one of his best.

This first Superduperman is too LONG!!  It is also very short on STORY.  All the stuff on Krypton with Superman's parents, the baby Superman's voyage to Earth, the teenage Superman-- all this stuff could have been told so much quicker.  The early scenes with Clark Kent and Margot Kidder at the Daily Planet are cute, but beyond that, there isn't much going on in this movie.  Lex Luthor wants to blow up the California coast, Superduperman has to stop it.  And the ending??  Well, I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it, but suffice it to say that I don't believe anyone can literally turn back the clock.
As for the DVD, yes its a lavish package (the screen tests are particularly fun).  But there are better movies that deserve this deluxe treatment far more.

But time, and having watched a completely different take on the legendary comic book figure in the TV series LOIS & CLARK, is not kind to the film.  We get a wonderful vision and vista of Krypton, a lilting and charming interlude in Kansas for the young Clark.  But once we get to Metropolis and Lois it's BOING!  Christopher Reeve does an excellent and charming Superman, but his disguise is Clark Kent (which should be his true personality, since he's been raised as a human), and the comic persona for Clark is either amusing or enough to make you cringe - it is patently ridiculous anyone would be behaving/looking like him.  You really can see why Lois would steamroll right past him.  And you can't see what he sees in her at all.  Perry White and Jimmy are perfect and so is the ease of flying sequences.

What can be said about this film that hasn't already?  Richard Donner was the only choice to direct, the casting was just about perfect, Christopher Reeve is Superman, no matter whose played him before and no matter who will ever play him again.  John Williams score takes this movie to another level entirely.  The Superman Theme going through the surround sound during the opening credits brought goosebumps.  The story is great, going from birth on Krypton, growing up in Smallville, and fulfilling his destiny in Metropolis, it's almost like you get three movies for the price of one.  And it works.
There are moments that sends chills down the spine, such as Superman's first public appearance (saving Lois and the helicopter).  Some would say that Luthor is played too much for laughs, but I think it works well.  I love Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, he has some of the best quotes in the movie.  ""Doesn't it just give you a... shudder of electricity to be in the same room with me?""  His ego is so huge, it's wonderful!
Anyways, everything's been said about this movie and I agree with all the positive things. :)  So, on to the DVD!  The sound is FANTASTIC!

609841,4,6303212263,"Man, do I love movies on DVD. How much do I love `em, you ask? Well, it's not just because of the extra features included in the Special Edition presentations. In the case of SUPERMAN The Movie, I decided to make a direct comparison between the DVD and the regular cut VHS edition. I got the disc, rented the tape, and then played both simultaneously on my TV, trying my best to keep them synchronous. I constantly switched back and forth between the VHS and DVD to see exactly which scenes were restored to the Special Edition. Yes, folks, this is my idea of a good time. Sad, isn't it?

But, thanks to my little side-by-side comparison, I was blown away by the amazing differences between the picture & sound qualities of the two formats of the first flick I ever saw in a theater. I was able to hear all of those subtle little background noises that are harder- if not impossible- to perceive on VHS. The tinkling of broken glass and the upheaval of Krypton's crust following the movies' opening credits is a wonderful example of the DVD's excellent sound variety & clarity. Of course, it also helps when the folks who released the DVD edition decided to enhance the sound as well!

Another great benefit of the superior audio is a better-sounding musical score. The opening titles theme is by far my all-time favorite piece of John Williams-composed movie music. No previous or subsequent Superman movie or TV show soundtrack score has even come close to capturing the essence of the character like Williams did for this movie. Ofttimes I'll watch the opening credits sequence several times in a row just so I can listen! There's even a music-only track where you can just kick back and play the DVD pretty much like it was a soundtrack CD!

The picture quality, aside from having a bit of a solarized glow during dissolves, was way sharper that its VHS counterpart. It was so sharp, in fact, I could see the matte borders around Kal-El's geode-cradle space ship-thingy as it flew through the psychedelic cosmos, as well as other limitations of the special effects of that era that were somewhat hidden in the muddier magnetic media. Hmm... perhaps having superior picture clarity isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh? Still, it's kinda cool to look back at the FX of the times and see how far things have advanced since then. Even director Richard Donner gets a bit nostalgic about the ""good ol' days"" of special effects on the commentary track. He also points out a few less-than-magic moments that he and co-commentator Tom Mankiewitz (sp?) get a bit of a laugh out of.

Then there are the new scenes, many of which passed by without me noticing much o a difference. It's likely due to the fact that I kinda remember them, since many of these bits were restored to the network TV broadcasts of the movie back in the 80s. One weird extra smidge of footage was the Kryptonian Council sending an enforcer to stop Jor-El from launching his sons' ship. Strangely enough, this little moment was never followed up; the enforcer was never seen again, save a brief appearance at the beginning of SUPERMAN II. Another cool addition is Superman running through Luthor's gauntlet of bullets, flames, and frost on his way to the criminal genius's lair (in the commentary track, Donner and Mankiewitz discussed the debate they had about whether or not they should have left the gauntlet scene in the theatrical release; they considered it too much of a ""the-audience-already-knows-about-Supes'-invulnerability-so-why-repeat-ourselves?"" thing, and ultimately dropped it). My favorite new moment, however, was an extension of the scene where young Clark Kent outruns the express train running through Smallville. This addition is one of those strange co-inky-dink-twist-of-fate-type moments that classic superhero books seem to have in spades. There's even a couple deleted scenes that weren't reincorporated into the movie involving Miss Teschmacher and Luthors' ""babies"". Fortunately, no footage was shot that made references to Ned Beatty's (Otis) performance in 'Deliverance.' Speakin' of Otis: the interplay between Hackman and Beatty's characters added a great touch of lighthearted humor to counterbalance Luthor's scary scheme to... well, let's just say it involves Luthor's obsession with real estate.

Included in the bonus features section (aside from the stuff I've already brought up) is a three-part ""making of"" documentary hosted by Marc ""Jimmy Olsen"" McClure, a teaser trailer, and a couple screen tests featuring a laughably skinny Christopher Reeve in the Big Blue togs before he got himself beefed up for the flick (in the commentary track, Donner mentions that Reeve's personal trainer was David Prowse, better known as the guy inside the Darth Vader suit) . While I've been a bit jaded by DVD bonus features and extras lately, a few of them were almost as entertaining as the movie itself! The part where Richard Donner was confident that Reeve would walk again was kinda sad, however...

Before I wind this review up, I'll leave you with a totally useless and time-wasting activity for you to perform while watching this film. There's a not-so-magic moment where you can see director Richard Donner's reflection on a pane of glass! He also has an intentional cameo later on in the movie. His brief performance isn't exactly Hitchcockian or Tarantino-esque, but I think he makes out okay. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (he points out both moments) while you're looking! Happy hunting!

`Late

UPDATE 7/20/2006: Ya might wanna hold off on buying this particular edition `til `round Thanksgiving 2006. I've a sneaking suspicion that Warner will be rereleasing this movie as well as all the other ones in super-mega-tricked-out special editions to coincide with the DVD release of ""Superman Returns."" Hey, they did the same thing with the ""Batman"" movies when they put ""Batman Begins"" on DVD; I wouldn't put it past the Warner guys to do it with the Supes flicks, as well...

609842,5,6303212263,"""Superman:The Movie"" is a tremendously magical fantasy that delivers the imagination in those who really believe a man can fly. 23 years after its release,the acting,story,cast and special effects hasn't lost its touch. The restoration of this film is the most pleasing I have seen and it's a thrill to watch the film in its original widescreen format. Christopher Reeve is a delight to watch. I love the screen tests and the theatrical trailer.",991526400,,445,5.027027027027027
609843,5,6303212263,"This movie is the greatest movie ever made, and for a superman fan like me, its a must buy. The film is directed with perfection and the special effects are superb, much better than later superman films. What makes this film different compared to most superhero films is that the movie contains emotion as well as nicely staged sequences, the first transformation of superman couldn't have been better at the helicopter scene. The acting was excellent, Christoper reeve couldn't have been replaced, and turned out to be a major aspect of the movie. The soundtrack was brilliant! John Williams composed the perfect tune to cohere with the superman feeling, and throughout the movie the music moves nicely with the sequences. However, mistakes were made and the acting of the cast saved any questioning of these mistakes, they include that Jor-el was wearing his rolex watch while placing the green crystal on the babies craft, Clark not being noticed when he jumps out the window, when the world is turned back jimmy turns up at a time he also should've turned up when superman was mourning lois's death, when superman transorms for the first time a full crowd doesnt notice him at the helicopter stage, when superman is told with his super speed he wouldnt catch the rockets, he is in the water for at least 5mins, when he's saved he catchs one of them but not both, it would've taken him the same time he was in the water to catch the other rocket. This might also mean that luthers judgement of supermans superspeed was wrong. The uncut scenes are worthy, although there is one uncut scene that is not added, this is when miss tesparker is dropped in the lion pitt and superman saves her. The three documentaries are good, especially when they show how superman flew. Overall a great epic! Well done Superman crew.",991526400,,1816,4.75
609844,5,6303212263,"Without knowing some of the behind-the-scenes wrangles during production of 1978's Superman: The Movie, listening to the DVD commentary by director Richard Donner and ""Creative Consultant"" Tom Mankiewicz can be like watching Austin Powers without ever seeing a James Bond film--it's enjoyable, but you may miss some of the jokes. Whether there were legal restrictions or just a desire ""to work in this town again,"" Donner and Mankiewicz are often a bit coy when discussing the production.
For starters, there's Mankiewicz' title--he was denied a writing credit on the film, though Donner and others have praised him for reshaping the Puzo-Newman-Benton script into a workable movie. So his alternative designation appears right after the writers during the opening titles. Donner's grievances got a bit more press at the time. Producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind, taking a page from their Three Musketeers films, wanted to shoot Superman I and II simulataneously. Donner shot extensive footage for the sequel, but later had a falling-out with the Salkinds, who brought in Musketeers director Richard Lester to finish the sequel and re-shoot much of Donner's material. Knowing this helps understand why Donner and Mankiewicz take the occasional swipe at movie producers, and the Salkinds in particular. (My favorite: Donner praises editor Stuart Baird, then mentions how he's also directed two great films ""in spite of his producers."") It also clarifies some of their comments regarding plot points in both films. Originally, one of the two missiles Luthor fires in I accidentally frees the Phantom Zone villains to set up II. And the famous turning-back-the-world scene was initially planned for the sequel, to erase Lois' memory of Superman's secret identity. The commentary is just part of this well-crafted DVD, which includes an extended ""director's cut"" of the movie itself, two additional deleted scenes with Luthor (too campy by far, they were rightfully kept out of the extended film), and screen tests for Christoper Reeve and a slew of would-be Lois Lanes (after Margot Kidder, Lesley Ann Warren would've been my pick). Nearly a quarter-century later, Superman is still one of the best superhero films ever. I have never understood why so many people prefer Superman II, with its cartoonish comic antics and its make-'em-up-as-we-go superpowers (how about that amnesia kiss?). For my money, Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz made the definitive Superman movie--in spite of the producers.",991526400,,2498,5.375
609845,5,6303212263,"Finally, this film is given the treatment it has been denied for years.  No longer imprisoned in a frustrating pan-and-scan format, ""Superman"" comes to life in this gorgeous widescreen transfer. There are tons of great special features as well, particularly the numerous screen tests with multiple actresses for the part of Lois Lane (Stockard Channing????!!!!). If you grew up in love with this film as I did, you owe it to yourself to add this DVD to your collection.",991180800,,469,4.936708860759493
609846,5,6303212263,"I was skeptical when I sat down to watch this movie again because I didn't know if it would be as good as I had remembered it from the last time I had seen it when I was a kid.  Luckily, it was all that and more.  This time around I was able to appreciate how well Donner balanced a love story with comedy, action, and camp to maintain the dignity of the story of Superman.  Reeve plays Clark Kent/Superman with such skill, you can tell he put a lot of thought into how he would tackle such a beloved character.  The special effects were ahead of their time and some of them still stunned me today.  This DVD is a great presentation of this excellent movie.  The commentary is insightful and gives you all the inside dirt on the production and how bad and long it really was.  The three documentaries on here are awesome too.  They show you the production step by step from casting to editing, and focus on the special effects.

My Only Criticism is the Fact that they did not include all the other extra scenes that were  shown on the Network TV version In California. I saw this when I was younger because one of My friends had it on VHS. Don't know how he got it? That was an Amazing Version, and I expected to see that on the DVD.

My 5 star rating is not for the movie it's self but for the quality of this DVD based on it's price and features. Superman the movie is a classic, but not my favorite in the series. Had I been judging for the film alone, I would have given it 3 stars. Chances are if you're buying it you've seen this before. The restoration work is beautiful, the bonus material is great, the added material is somewhat frustrating at times. It's obvious why they cut many of these scenes.",990921600,2,684,4.269230769230769
609879,5,6303212263,"this is how a comic book character should be brought to life. A strong cast. Great special effects (which still hold up well). And a slightly self-mocking sense of humor. Director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) was kicked out before completing this movie, but it's a tribute to his abilities none-the-less. Christopher Reeve stepped into the role that had ruined the careers of Kirk Alyn and George Reeves. And while his Clark Kent was a little too broadly played, Superman lived on in his jaw-first portrayal. For those who wondered about the casting of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, just watch the screen test footage to see why she was chosen.
Still a remarkably good movie after all these years.",990921600,,697,4.8655462184873945
609880,5,6303212263,"It's very rare to find a DVD with interesting extras and more than what you've bargained for.  Indeed ""Superman-The Movie"" has a great deal of extras that make me think that...WOW!  Now this is DVD!!!
I don't care if I find the additional scenes unnecessary, but the image quality is one of the best I've seen so far.  The visual effects never looked better -I'd like to make a special reference to the main credits...WHOOOSH!  The sound mix is excellent.  I mean everything about this transfer is fantastic.
The extras are great.  Those three documentaries show different aspects of the movie that I never figured out, especially I was moved by the references to Christopher Reeve's struggle to stand from his wheelchair and cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, whose work on ""Superman-The Movie"" was the last one before his death.  You also marvel yourself to find out the lengths reached by the visual effects wizards to create the illusion of the Man Of Steel flying.
But the best, I think, is the isolated track of John Williams' rousing score.  Not only does the DVD have the music edited to fit the film, but also the alternate cues which are mostly found on the Rhino soundtrack CD.  I thank Warner Bros. for including such a fantastic extra.
""Superman-The Movie"" is definitely the best DVD released this year.  I don't know whether future releases will have the same quality of this one, but one thing is certain:  This DVD does fly!!!",990748800,,1442,4.797570850202429
609881,5,6303212263,"I have waited about twenty years to see the footage of Superman the Movie which was only shown on ABC television during its broadcast run.  None of the cable stations which picked it up ever bothered to do so.  I remember vividly seeing Supes going through Luthor's gauntlet (who cares if the villain already knew that The Man of Steel would be impervious to the bullets, fire, and ice?) as a 6 or 7 year old being able to stay up past my nine o' clock bedtime.  The sound and picture quality is outstanding and the behind the scenes extras (starring Jimmy Olsen himself- what ever became of him anyway?) are fun.  There are even some lost lost scenes deleted from the final film- Superman's rescue of Miss Teshmacker for one.

Extra features, remastering of picture and sound (even those ugly ""green"" costume scenes--remember?). Superman has been an international icon for many years, and for this new generation of technology and home theater, there couldn't be a better way to introduce him to a younger generation of SuperFans. The addition of deleted footage fleshes out great scenes on Krypton, and on Earth as well. Run--or if you can, FLY to the store and grab the whole box set--even if the others aren't as high-tech as the original. If you don't have a DVD player, buy one if just for this one being your first disc. God Bless Richard Donner and Warner Brothers (even if you didn't re-release this in the theaters--for shame!). Let's not forget the man himself, Christopher Reeve, who will always be Superman to me. We beleived a man can fly when we saw you on the silver screen, just as much as we believe you'll walk again SOON... The Superman Special Edition is destined to be a classic DVD for a long time...trust me--after seeing it hundreds of times, I still get that same revved up feeling when those opening titles start, and they don't stop until the end credits finish.

The film itself has been brilliantly restored for the DVD. SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE has never looked better. I did have to turn the volume up a little on my TV set to hear everything, but that is the single flaw in this DVD release. All of the memorable scenes are hear better than ever. The destruction of Krypton,Jon and Martha Kent finding Kal-El for the first time, the Fortress of Solitude, Superman appearing to the public for the first time to rescue Lois Lane from a helicopter, and the list goes on. There are some scenes added to this version also. I think just about any additional scenes to SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE just make it better and even more enjoyable.
Even the DVD extras are quite good. There are some movie trailers and the famous teaser are here also. I enjoyed the three documentaries. They were made recently for this DVD edition of SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE and there are interviews with almost all of the principles involved, including Christopher Reeve. Plus, there are some cuts of John Williams famous music score included as well.
In case you were wondering, I really liked this DVD. It had been a long time since I saw SUPERMAN, and it still holds up today. When I was younger, I believed a man could fly, and I don't see why anyone else wouldn't believe a man could fly, even today.",990489600,2,1550,4.519572953736655
609884,5,6303212263,"Superman The Movie is still the best superhero movie to date.

Thank the director, Richard Donner, for maintaining closely to the comic book while keeping the interaction between a super alien and humans as real as possible. Also for introducing us to then newcomer Christopher Reeve. Reeve's portrayal of a humble, quirky, klutzy Clark Kent and dynamic, powerful, might makes right ""man of steel"" is so right on. Perfect casting.

The music provided us with a nice feel for the movie. An excellent soundtrack and arguably the best one to date. Who doesn't recognize the famous opening Superman theme, young or old? The Superman/Lois Lane love theme ""Can You Read My Mind"" showing them flying through the night sky was my favorite. Damn good job for a 1978 film.

Superman the Movie is a film that fills you with a yearning to be like it's main character. Someone to look up to who is powerful, down to earth and, well... super. It is a very well made movie and even more so now with it's new features and deleted scenes on DVD. ""The Gauntlet"" scene is incredible. I love the screen tests.

609885,4,6303212263,"I am so glad Superman is now on DVD!  It is one of my favorite features.  The special features on the DVD are very nice.  Christopher Reeve's screen test is finally shown, along with the other actors.  The three feature documentaries were all very interesting, particularly the explanation of what happened to Richard Donner after the first feature.  It shed a lot of light on what happened after the first movie.  It makes you wonder what would have happened to II if Donner had finished it.
I also enjoyed the audio commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewics.  They provide interesting and funny commentary.  Mankiewics mentions that 70% of II was already finished by the time the first movie came out.  Also note the scene where Donner mentions a real good looking actor that Clark Kent is talking to. When he turns around, it's Donner himself.
My only problem with the DVD is the restoration of the previously cut scenes.  Why couldn't they give two versions of the film, one theatrical version and one special version (like the Terminator II and Independence Day)?  These scenes were cut for a reason and they are detrimental to the finished product when they are inserted back in.  The added scenes on Krypton don't amount to much.  Neither does the scene between Brando and Reeve on the Fortress of Solitude.  I also didn't care for the flashy scenes where Luthor tries to kill Superman with the machine guns, fire, and ice methods.  We are supposed to be entertained by how confident Lex Luthor is in his brains.  In the theatrical version, Superman lands in Luthor's hideaway, proceeds to the entrance, and tears down the door.  Luthor calmly sits in his chair waiting for him, poised because he knows he has outsmarted him with Kryptonite.  In this expanded edition, Luthor tries several methods to kill him.  Why does he have to do this when he already has the solution up his sleeve.
Still, this is a very entertaining DVD and worth buying.  I only wish they would do this with the 2nd one.",990403200,12,2007,4.712643678160919

It gives behind the scenes look at the making, footage never seen since the ABC broadcast and a beautiful picture and great sound. So why I'm I disappointed? Because Warner Bros stops at the first film. The release of the next 3 Superman films are a major disappointment. Part II was a great movie and could stand by itself, but there is about a half hour of film that was shot and has never been shown. Most Superman fans would love to see it, why is Warner holding back? Parts III & IV in my opinion, while entertaining, not up to the level of excellence of the first 2 films and if Warner wants me to buy them, is going to have to pony up a lot more reason to buy them then just to have them on DVD. Most DVD owner's have huge Movie collections before they bought the new system. If the studios want us to buy rereleases of  older films, they have to justify the purchase, better picture quality isn't reason enough on this new format(most of the time). Part IV has huge gapping holes in it, and I'm not buying any but the first one until Warner get's its act together. While you wait for Warner to get smart, buy the Anchor Bay Version of ""Supergirl.""

Superman: The Movie is well acted and well scripted, and simply holds up as one of the most exciting movies of our time. Christopher Reeve was never better than when he was wearing the red, yellow, and blue, and of all four Superman movies, he shined the brightest in the first one.
But this DVD is not just about the terrific film it represents. Warner has produced a disc that belongs in every DVD lover's collection. The excellent picture and the astounding audio are just the start.

There's an added scene in the first few minutes with Marlon Brando, and i am suprised it was never in the original release, because it just helps explain Krypton better.  Then, there's another added scene where Lex Luthor tries to kill Superman with bullets and stuff, and I'm suprised that wasn't in the original release.  The visual transfer of the movie is amazing.  It is extremely clear, and a joy to watch the visuals.  The audio has been remastered in Dobly Digital.  I have a subwoofer on my sound system, and all I can say is that it really was put to excellent use during th earthquake.  The movie is also in anamorphic widescreen, which I love.  Movies shoul always be viewed in a widescreen, and never pan and scan.  I'll admit, I grew up loving Superman.  Now, with this DVD, that love has be rekindled.

The salkind team gave it life and made one of the best comic to film transfers ever , the very reason why Superman works lies in it's magic and the very charm of it's cast and crew who all struggled to make an authentic film that would  appeal to comic fans as well as mainstream movie goers but  no one could have ever anticipated what Superman would do ,  but it sky rocketed at the box office , having the second  longest box office run in history. Even the director says  that no one could have played the role of the man of steel like Christopher Reeve for the hour and a half that he was  in it he was Superman and the uniform never looked better  on him better than any comic book could show him.
  It's cast includes the great Marlon Brando,Christopher Reeve,Margot Kidder,Gene Hackman,Jackie Cooper. The film  starts on the i'll fated Krypton where after a trail with 3 mysterious foes. Kalel played brillantly by Brando has a warning sign that Krypton is in danger,but the counsil  refuses to beleive him fearing the worst he and his wife  prepare to send his only child a son named Jorel to Earth as he sends the starship on his way the planet is self  distructing twords the sun until final distructon.
  When the starship lands in Smallville,Kansas he is now introduced to an elderly couple who will be his future  family. The film skips to Clark Kent's teenage years who  is played charmingly by Jeff East but must be embarresingly dubbed by Reeve is the most centimental part of the film  as he tries to cope with having super powers but when he  looses his father he dicovers a crystal and then discovers  where his future lies to the North Pole where he magically makes a fortress of solitude , there he will begin to learn about his past his father and why he is on earth after all  is said and done his father is now ready to give the world his son and we shall know him as SUPERMAN.
  In the film we switch scenes yet again to the Daily  Planet in New York where he plays out his secret identity and meets the specal woman that will capture SUPERMANS heart Lois Lane played humeriously by Margot Kidder when an accident happens atop a building when she is sent in  for an assignment , the world will get there first encounter with the man of steel an sets Lois heart afire,the most  romantic scene is a flying scene a memerable one with  Superman and Lois, but just as things are going well for Superman he meets his nemisis Lex Luthor who is played  even more humeriously by Gene Hackman who devises a plan for world domination and gives Superman a taste of his  own planet Kryptonite. Superman delays Luthors plans only to find the Lois is a casulty Supeman brakes the rules to save her and sets the tone for the exciting Superman 2.

Audio wise this version blows aways all previous home video versions of the film.  Still, the dialogue track at times sounds a bit flat in comparison to both the music track and new foley track (which I personally have no problem with at all).
The layer switch point is a bit akward and points out a minor print flaw that at normal speed would not be visable.  A better switch point would have been immediately following the air force one sequence (which would not have had affected either the commentary track or the music only track).
The deleted scenes section is beyond skimpy with only two scenes, this is a DVD-18 release and the supplemental section is not exacly what you'd call packed with goodies.  Call it a hunch but I'm sure all of the unused scenes could have been included (note: the ""Jaws"" DVD was single sided and featured a far more generous offering of outakes and deleted scenes).

I just can't say enough about this DVD.Buy it just to see the MANY actresses who tried out for Lois Lane alone. There are WAY too many extras to list them all,I'll just say that you have to flip the disc over there are that many.",989539200,,627,4.190082644628099
609936,5,6303212263,"Well, you know the rest. That's the great thing about this movie, it's uplifting and entertaining. Makes you want to believe a man can fly (hence the tagline used in the original promotional campaign). And what this DVD does best is show you how they did that. Three full-length documentaries take you back to 1977, when there was no CGI and computer animation to create breathtaking stunts in mere days. Back then you had to do it with blue screens, wires, gimbals, some trick photography, and months of work (the film took two years to make), and still you had to cross your fingers that the result would turn out right. It's truly fascinating to see how different things were and how well they pulled it off. Other bonuses are the screen tests featuring actors such as Stockard Channing and Lesley Ann Warren reading for the part of Lois Lane, as well as a young and skinny kid named Christopher Reeve in his first screen test in the red and blue suit. The documentaries also feature present-day interviews with the director, special effects crew, and the actors. If you saw this movie when it was on TV in the early '80s you'll remember most of the additional 8 minutes of footage (including the ""gauntlet"" where Lex Luthor tries to shoot, burn and freeze Superman, to no avail). I do somehow remember some more scenes which are not here, such as Otis wiping his arm across his forehead and smearing the missle codes (which is why he messes them up) but two additional scenes are provided which are not integrated into the movie: Otis feeding Luthor's ""pets"" (whatever they are), and Superman rescuing Miss Tesmacher from same ""pets"" after saving Lois. The audio quality is incredible, and the video is crisp and clear (which, unfortunately, tends to highlight the limitations of the blue screen technique). The disc is double-sided, with the documentaries and screen tests on ""side B"" (although it is not so marked which can be annoying). Overall this is a great addition to any DVD collection.",989539200,,1999,4.763688760806916
610005,5,6303212263,"The name Superman brings back so many memories doesn't it? Well watching this special edition brought back all of those feelings and more. This is a FANTASTIC dvd! All dvd's should aspire to be this good! The other reviews seem to mostly touch on the sound and picture quality (which are great), but I thought I would do a review mostly on the EXTRAS on this disc which are just incredible.
First of all, there are 3, approximately half hour, documentaries on the making of Superman. These are the real gems of this disc. They're great! One involves pre-production, one involves production and one involves the special effects. They are all roughly a half hour each and they are all well worth your time. You see the original screen tests for both Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder plus screen tests of ... Anne Archer, Leslie Ann Warren, Stockard Channing and other famous actresses all tested for Lois and you see them all. I didn't notice anyone famous trying out for SUPES because they decided early on that they wanted an unknown but there are screen tests of plenty of unknowns including the dentist of one of the producers wives! Too funny. There are some great scenes here. The great thing about all these documentaries is that you get to hear from everyone involved in NEW interviews, even Christopher Reeve. Many documentaries or featurettes on other dvd's try and cut together old interviews and try and fool you into thinking you are getting something new. Not here! This is all new stuff! The second documentary even touches on the shady dealings of the producers of this film and all the wrangling done to get this film to the big screen. It's all quite fascinating. The third documentary is on special effects and it shows you numerous flying tests that they tried to get the man of steel to fly. Some are really bad and some are funny, but in the end, they figured it out. Flying is just one part of this documentary, they also go into matte painting, rear projection, front projection and many other techniques that were new to the biz and even effects that had never been attempted until this film. It really shows you the innovations that this film achieved that would set a precedent for future films to come. There's a lot more stuff in these documentaries but I think I'll just let you discover them for yourself.
There are ADDED scenes that were not shown theatrically but that are edited back into this ""director's cut"" of this dvd version. Most of them are throw away scenes or ""bridges"" for other scenes but I can't for the life of me figure out why they cut out the ""FIRE AND ICE"" sequence in the original theatrical version. It's fantastic. I also got a kick out of ""little Lois"" on the train.
There are 2 deleted scenes, that don't add much to the movie and I can see why they were deleted, but I did laugh at one of them.
Some of the deleted scenes and the added scenes have been shown in expanded tv versions of this film but if you have never seen them, they are quite a treat and it's just good to have them in your home in such a high quality dvd transfer.
The alternate music scores I didn't get much out of and I doubt you will either unless you are a big follower of music scores.
The commentary by Director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewiczwas was great. You could tell that these two really had a lot of fun making this picture and a lot of love for the final product. They told some great stories on their troubles filming certain scenes, how they hired certain actors and even giving kudos along the way to the behind-the-scenes folk who helped out. There's some great insight on this commentary on how much hard work it really took to get this picture made. Tom has a great memory and seemed to tell a lot of ""little things"" that even Richard Donner had forgotten.
The trailers and tv spots were cool to see and they brought back definite memories, including a teaser trailer that I remember way back when, that caused roars of applause from the audience.
If you have even a little nostalgia for this film, you are going to love it! Some of the effects don't hold up in this day and age , but a surprising number of them do! I found myself thinking to myself ""how did they do that back in 1978?"". The answer: By Hand. The story is timeless and even though today's younger audience might be jaded with all of today's computer wizadry, I think this movie stands the test of time. Just the EXTRAS alone make this disc worth it. After watching this film, you too will believe a man can fly ... I know I did ...
ENJOY!",989539200,19,4577,4.482634730538922
610006,5,6303212263,"Personally, this is one of the movies I wanted on DVD when I first got my player. Of course, being new to the DVD, I figured they'd have just about every movie possible converted to DVD. I figured wrong and was so disappointed that I bought what figured to be the next best thing... the BATMAN DVD. I figured wrong again. All I know is BATMAN better be the next super-hero flick to get the ""special"" treatment. If they did the same thing as SUPERMAN, I would not have minded a long and predictable wait. I have watched my SUPERMAN DVD atleast 5 times all the way through including the special extras, and it has to be the best ""special edition"" movie I've bought since FIGHT CLUB! The documentaries are unbelieveable and definetely something I was looking forward to more than watching the new footage. It still amazes me how they made Superman fly! The added scenes are the second best special item on the DVD. They don't ruin the movie at all but actually explain and make original scences more interesting, if not better. Another item is the screen tests. They can be interesting to watch, sometimes. The rest of the time you can actually feel embarrassed having watched the entirety of them. These screen tests are however pretty enjoyable. The only complaints you can give this DVD is the following: 1.) Warner Bros. need to get with it. The cardboard case they offer may save them some big bucks compared to plastic cases, but everybody I know hate them. They are too easy to break, especially the inside that holds in the DVD. Those always seem fragile until they do break. Plus... 2.) They fit everything on one disc using both sides, making the disc more delicate (smudges, scratches, etc). I am still angry about the GOODFELLAS DVD I bought which forces you to flip the DVD halfway through the film. But the special features on SUPERMAN are worth the flip. In closing, I believe everyone will give their personal recommendation on this DVD. Everyone, somehow or someway, is a big Superman fan. For a true comicbook fan, this is icing on the cake. Bon appetite!",989280000,,2070,4.627717391304348
610007,5,6303212263,"SUPERMAN THE MOVIE falls into the ""they-don't-make-movies-like-that-anymore"" category.  It is a hybrid of 60's ""epic"" movies, 70's all-star-cast disaster flicks, and the late-70's special effects films (like STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).
The DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  The extra's are very interesting - 3 documentaries illuminate the journey from page to screen.  The battles between director Richard Donner and his producers are fascinating.  However, in all fairness, one wishes the Salkinds (or someone on their side) could respond.
There are some very cool early flying effects in the bonus stuff.  The screen tests are hilarious - Stockard Channing as Lois Lane would have been a hoot.  Lesley Anne Warren was an interesting choice as well.  However, when Margot Kidder's screen test appears it is obvious why she was chosen.  In her screen test she had a bad haircut and a 70's hippy dress on.  However, she simply glows with energy and the magic required to help the audience believe a man can fly.
The film has held up well.  It moves from Greek-like Krypton to the Americana of Smallville to the zippy, campy feel of Metropolis.  Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luthor.
The re-inserted scenes are fine.  They are really minor additions to this great film.  They only help make it better.  (I'd really like to hear/see more of the SUPERMAN II cut scenes!)
SUPERMAN is a super DVD!",989280000,,1399,5.0
610008,5,6303212263,"I was glad to see 'Superman' available once again for purchase. I couldn't find a copy to buy for the longest time, and was happy they decided to rerelease it in a special edition. The restored film was a pleasure to watch again, but the extras on the tape made it extra special. Not having made the jump to DVD yet, I am pleased when tapes get the 'extras' treatment. Although not as decked out as the DVD, the tape offers the films trailer and the screen tests for the film. It was enjoyable to see other actresses such as Anne Archer and Lesley Anne Down try out for the role of Lois Lane, as it was clearly evident why Margot Kidder was chosen. All in all, a good package for us still stuck with VHS technology.",989280000,,715,4.226277372262774
610009,4,6303212263,"One of my all-time favorite films has finally been given the DVD treatment.  This long-awaited release was postponed several times (it was supposed to be released last year).  The good news is that the picture has never looked better (Remember watching a grainy out-of-focus Superman: The Movie on television for the last 20 years?).  There is also about 8 minutes of restored footage (mostly with Marlon Brando) which adds a little more to the emotional impact of the film (particularly the added scene with Jor-El in the Fortress of Solitude)
Now the bad news: There's a scene on Krypton when a Sentinel is sent to arrest Jor-El.  Now we see the Sentinel leaving for Jor-El's quarters in this restored scene, but what we don't see is the rest of this scene, which I felt should've also been restored.  The Sentinel is flying through Krypton's massive canyons only to be killed by a falling building in the Krypton-quake. Also, the sound effects (mostly in the first half-hour of the film) have not been ""enhanced"" as previously announced, but REPLACED with completely different sounds.  This is very distracting, since for the last 23 years you're used to hearing very different things going on in the film (especially in the Krypton scenes). Also the music queues seem to be a little out of sync with some of the movie's scenes.  I read an interview the other day with director Richard Donner, who supervised the restoration.  He claimed to be unaware that the sound effects of the original film were omitted and replaced.  He was told they were simply were being ""enhanced"". (Interesting). Although after stating that, I have to admit that I did like the new sounds in the opening credit sequence.  They add to the anticipation and are really a heart-stopper.
My personal opinion is that if you're restoring a classic film, or making a special edition, it's okay to add something (such as deleted scenes) or to enhance something. But you shouldn't REMOVE something altogether (remember the same thing was done by George Lucas in two of the Star Wars ""Special Edition"" films). This disc was also originally supposed to be a 2-disc set containing the original theatrical cut of the film, but I guess they changed their minds for some reason (?).  I guess the sound affects issue probably won't be too big a deal to most people, but for some movie buffs (including myself) it's a little annoying.  For the most part though the DVD is excellent, complete with 3 documentaries, screen tests, trailers and 2 additional deleted scenes (which also should've been restored).
Let's hope for a Superman II Special Edition next!",989193600,5,2620,4.876126126126126
610010,5,6303212263,"This movie is a true classic. Incorporating everything audiences have come to love about superhero films, it simply takes you back to a place and time that can be so easily forgotten.  After years of viewing films that just seem to miss the mark entirely when transferring a classic comic book hero to the big screen, this movie is the true master of the genre.
From the opening credits I was blown away by the improvement of the sounds effects!  It's unbelievable hearing this after having listened to my old VHS tape over the last 12 years!  Scene after scene has been re-mastered and it's truly something to be appreciated after hearing everything in mono on my old TV and VCR.  The scenes of planet Krypton being destroyed by the red sun is breathtaking!
Now onto the added scenes: I was a little confused by previous reviews saying the studio only added 8 minutes of footage.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!  This disc does have the coveted Superman saves Valerie Perrine scene, it's just not included with the finished movie.  Having seen the ABC version of the film years ago, there really isn't anything missing unless I AM missing something.  The scenes of Jor El and the counsel is engaging and gives the momentum of the disastrous destruction of Krypton a more emotional feel instead of just seeing a bunch of Kryptonians you don't even know fall into the abyss.  One scene I had completely forgotten about, was the scene where they show Lois Lane as a child sitting next her mother on a train watching the teen aged Superman (Clark Kent) running faster than a locomotive.  In the original movie, it just shows the girl as a ""just a little girl"" and not ""Lois Lane.""  That scene is just so cool!  I don't know why:)  Another scene I completely forgot about was the scene where Clark Kent is standing outside a store watching a TV and the crowd is standing there in disbelief seeing a man fly through Metropolis and a man turns to Clark Kent and says something to the effect of how unbelievable it is and Clark says ""It's not so unbelievable."" or something like that;)  The added scenes are great and effective, I think fans will especially love the scene with Lex Luthor trying to destroy Superman in his lair.  Just too cool!
The commentaries are great, very effective and informative.  I am not one to listen to the commentaries simply because I love watching ""just the movie.""  But the commentary gives a lot of interesting information to the making of the film that film students would find real interesting.  The documentaries are real cool!

610013,5,6303212263,"Watching Superman The Movie is an experience. Not only are you treated to a film good for the kids, but there are also many moments that will thrill adults. The movie is filled with emotion, action and incredible excitement.
The movie opens with long introductions about Superman's past and his time growing up on Earth. We are treated wish such scenes as his launch into space, his ""naked"" discovery on Earth and his ""calling"" to go north. All of this fills pretty much the first hour of the film but we are never once bored.
Once the action moves to Metropolis, it is almost like a whole new movie. The interaction between Lois and Clark is simply priceless. Their early scenes together build on what is to come, even moving into Superman II.  Margo Kidder was perfect for this role. She just had the right look for Lois: attractive without being a Super Model. It was just so sweet how Superman took to her. We are also introduced to Lex Luthor and his gang. Gene Hackman was perfect for this role and he really steals ever scene that he is in.
The thing about Superman is that it has an epic feel to it and it never looks back. From the launch of ""baby"" Superman to the climatic ending sequences, we are drawn into the story. The witty dialogue is also one of the best aspects of the film. Whether it is the nonchalant comments from Superman (i.e. ""Bad Vibrations"") to the famous, clap inducing ""You've Got Me? Who's got you?"" you never feel that any of the film is scripted. And the special effects, while dated (the miniatures LOOK miniature), are also extremely good.
The DVD version is an absolute joy. You get 9 minutes of new footage, including more scenes in the Fortress of Solitude with Marlon Brando. There are several behind the scenes looks and several trailers and cast bios. The enhanced sound is also very impressive. When the credits at the beginning started to appear and then fly by, I was just taken back! I wasn't expecting it at all and it was a taste of things to come. You can even hear shards of kryptonite flying through space after Krypton explodes.
Superman The Movie is one of the best comic book movies in the same tradition of greats like Dick Tracy and The Shadow. If you or your kids have never seen it, this is a must have. If you have, relive the magic again.",988934400,,2297,4.469047619047619

Why oh why do you encourage consumers to buy only half finished products. It is not as if this film is a recent blockbuster, but it was at the time a great film and even more so when you consider that it`s sequel was even better. Together Superman I and II were excellent pieces of entertainment. Forget III and Quest for Peace (not bad but nowhere near the same calibre). I along with many others would have thought that the first 2 in the series should have both been re-mastered etc. All I can imagine is that Superman II will be re-mastered due to public demand, then those poor consumers who bought the box set will be agrieved. This happened with Laserdiscs and also with DVDs (re-Kubrick). Greedy Studio is all I can say of Warner.

It takes Superman seriously, yet has comic relief that never veers into total camp.  At the core of the movie is a wonderful love triangle between Superman, Clark and Lois.  No comic book movie since has captured anything remotely close to romance.  Superman's act of love in the end is touching and, like it's character and the movie itself, epic.  It challenges a straight-and-narrow Boy Scout character with raw emotion.  This new DVD is wonderful.  It contains three half-hour informative documentaries, several funny and interesting screen tests, and a lush transfer.  The 8 minutes edited back into the film don't add much beyond a curiosity level, but they don't detract from the final product either.  At this price, this is definitely a must-have.

I would buy this DVD for the extras alone.  Three, count 'em, three documentaries on the making of this film (which come off as more of a tribute to Christopher Reeve, which is fine by me!  If it had been anybody else in the suit, the film probably wouldn't have worked as well.), screen tests, trailers, deleted scenes, music cues and lots of text make this one of the more complete DVD packages.  Then there's the movie itself: widescreen digital transfer, 5.1 audio, enhanced visual and audio effects and additional scenes.  While this film does have it's flaws (the villains are too comedic - Otis is this film's Jar Jar Binks), it got so much right by taking the story seriously.  The documentaries will tell you how close they came to screwing it all up and you'll get an idea of how good Superman II would have been had Donner not been screwed.

The video quality of this DVD is excellent.  This is the first time I have seen this film since I was young.  Now that I'm older I can truly appreciate the riveting performance Christopher Reeve gave as Clark Kent/Superman.  Reeve provided each character with a distinctive personality.  This lent credibility to the story.  Reeve's mannerisms also gave the flying sequences authenticity. The greatest compliment I can give Christopher Reeve is that whenever I think of Superman I will instantaneously think of him.  The supporting cast of Superman were also excellent.  Marlon Brando (Jor-El) and Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) both gave outstanding performances.  This DVD also has additional scenes that were not in the theatrical release.  These scenes are not frivolous and really add a new dimension to the film.  For example, there is more of Jor-El emphasizing his son's purpose on Earth.

Sadly, we are only thrown two bones (the extra Jor-El scene in the Fortress and the Gauntlet of Doom).  While it is absolutely incredible to finally have the Gauntlet of Doom restored and included in all it's greatness, there is SOOOOOO much more that really should've been included.  Some of the exclusions I can understand, but how on Earth can they justify not including the scene of Superman swooping out of the sky and into the path of the XK-101 (only to have the rocket GO AROUND HIM)?  IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SEQUENCES IN THE WHOLE FILM!!  For those unaware, in the early '80's a California TV station (KCOP) showed ONE TIME ONLY the fabled ""Ultimate"" Superman the movie with all intact usable footage restored and included.  The scene I refer to takes place just after Superman explodes out of Luthor's lair and pursues the rocket.  In this DVD, the next time we see Superman he flies over the heads of some guys in the desert repairing a fence, chasing the first rocket, but in the UNCUT version he is seen in an amazing effects shot gliding majestically into the path of the rocket where he braces himself for the impact.  However, the rocket is specially equipped to detect obstacles and simply goes around him.  Superman looks shocked for a moment, then tears off in pursuit.  THEN the scene picks up with the fence-repairmen.  This is just one small, but IMPORTANT example of the omissions.  Also, I had the distinct feeling that the soundtrack was heavily edited.  It turns out that I don't think it is, it's just that the KCOP version makes absolutely the fullest use of John Williams' full score.  And what's with the altered sound effects?  I've no problem with audio-enhancement (ala the recent re-release of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine), but they outright CHANGED many sounds in the film!!  Remember the cool ""zzzzrrrrrmmmm"" sound as young Clark hurles the green crystal off into the distance?  It's GONE!  Replaced with another sound that I guess they thought was more impressive or something.  I dunno, maybe it's me.  I'm a purist.  I didn't care too much for the Star Wars ""Special Edition"" changes either.  Okay, the POSITIVE now.  The DVD IS worth the money, though.  Why, you ask, after I just ""ripped"" it?  Simple---EXTRAS!  Tons and tons of extras!!  You can spend nearly as long watching and reading the amazing and enthralling extras as the film itself.  Several very informative documentaries.  I was impressed!  And even modern-day interviews with the cast, including Chris Reeve.  BOTTOM LINE--buy the DVD for the extras (and ONLY for the extras!), but give yourself the real treat by obtaining the KCOP version!",988761600,,2969,4.783464566929134
610135,5,6303212263,"This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. Every element of this motion picture is pure class: the cast, director, script, special effects, musical score, etc. It was the first major screen adaption of a comic book superhero, and arguably still the best (although the new ""Spiderman"", slated for release in 2002, looks to be a major contender). While special effects technology has greatly advanced over the past two decades, no other superhero film has so accurately depicted a character as well as ""Superman: The Movie"". It is a truly magical Hollywood product that has aged remarkable well over the past 20+ years. However, as with so many other film series, the sequels which followed were progressively less fulfilling, but the original remains a remarkable achievement.
Riddle me this - how is it that a lame piece of crap like ""Supergirl"" get a deluxe two-disc release with THX mastering and a plastic box, while the man of steel only rates a single (albeit double-sided) DVD and a flimsy cardboard case? I would have gladly shelled out $5.00 to $10.00 extra for THX mastering and proper-packaging. Even still, the extras on the ""Superman"" DVD are exceptional, providing more than a night's worth of entertainment.",988761600,2,1238,4.9855072463768115
610136,4,6303212263,"Here, finally, is Superman on DVD. And I am pleased to say that it  looks better here than it has ever looked on home video/laserdisc.  They have been able to remove a lot of the grainyness in those tricky scenes on Krypton and the color has a much punchier effect this time around.  Now the bad news for the purists out there (myself included). The sound has been given a serious make-over. Now, this is great on the one hand as John Williams' score finally gets the in-your-face, 5.1 treatment. The problem is that Warner Bros. has allowed the foley to be redone in many places.  The opening credits finally have the sound ""kick"" they have always needed but the wooshing sound is a brand new sound -not the original at all- and it is noticable to any fan. Several of Superman taking off shots now include an obvious ""new"" swoosh sound as well. Bummer.  Does Warner Bros. really think that kids today will enjoy this film better if they fool with it to make it sound like Star Wars(which also has been screwed with too much)?  This disc has plenty of goodies as well.  The screen tests are really interesting b/c we get to see Christopher Reeve BEFORE he got buff in his Superman outfit- he looks rather feminine. He also is sporting HUGE sweat marks under his arms. There are some surprises as we find out who was up for Lois Lane.  This is a must buy for fans but it is sad that the trend is to ""sweeten"" a film that is over 25 years old to make it more accessable.  The fact that it was made in 1978 is part of its charm today. Is the 33' Kong due for a make-over? Help!",988675200,,1574,4.2727272727272725
610137,5,6303212263,"Until the recent Star Wars reissue Superman was the movie I had seen more times in the theater than any other film-somewhere between 15-20. When it was first aired on TV (over 2 evenings) it included several scenes that hadn't made it to the theatrical release or any previously released video version. Now, with the release of the Special Edition DVD we have... some of them. But even without the infamous golf course scene this edition rocks! The movie speaks for itself (as do the high ratings we've given it) but the bonus features included are worth the price of the DVD.  Seeing Christopher Reeve in the documentary was a treat. I'd been under the impression that he wasn't interested in talking about this film and was delighted to see him (looking pretty darn good too. I can't wait to see him act again). The screne tests are not only a nice piece of film history, but a testament to the positive evolution of the screenplay. These ""earlier drafts"" of well known scenes actually kinda stink. Fortunately they were improved for the film. What mskes this movie truely epic is the strength of the performers and the crew. Sure, there are moments of pure cheese, but there are also some compelling, dramatic moments as well. Lois's death is a scene permanently ingrained in my mind. What a great piece of my childhood, returning even better than I remember it.",988675200,3,1365,4.7112970711297075
610138,5,6303212263,"Just finished watching the disc, including ALL of its features. The disc has 2 sides(which, by the way, are very hard to distinguish from one another as the disc has no label-one must be nearsighted to read what the lettering on the disc says) & includes the film (with added & mostly unseen footage), the directors commentary (with director Richard Donner & writer Tom Mankewicz-did I spell that right?), 3 very interesting documentaries about the making of the film, trailers, & the soundtrack.
I for one do not read comic books & do not generally enjoy comic book movies but SUPERMAN I & II are among my favorite films becuase, unlike X-MEN or BATMAN, they were poignant & had heart. I recommend buying copies of I & II since they were so excellent but not III or IV which were so very AWFUL (by the way, how unusual is it for I & II, among the best films ever made, to be followed up by III & IV, among the worst films ever made?)!",988675200,,935,4.379310344827586
610139,5,6303212263,"Superman is an excellent example of a movie which came along at the perfect time.  America in December 1978 was a country consumed with self-doubt: Watergate, lingering wounds from the Vietnam War, and Economic Stagnation were all on the national consciousness (just as the Great Depression, and a Europe sliding into war were on the minds of most Americans when the original Superman comic debuted in 1938).  The cinema of the 1970s reflected this: All the President's Men and The China Syndrome reinforced the impression that America's best days were behind her.

Superman was the antithesis to all of that self-doubt, and was the cornerstone of what Christopher Reeve called the ""New Patriotism.""  Riding on the heels of the success of Star Wars, Superman was a feel good movie with fine plotting, groundbreaking special effects, and wonderful acting from all involved - especially the young unknown actor who would don the cape and bring new dimensions to an old role.

The movie has held up very well over the years.  True, hairstyles and car models look dated from a 21st Century viewpoint.  But a great film rides or falls on the script, and that has not dated at all.  The classic themes are all here: greed (Lex Luthor's nuclear land-grab scheme), rebellion against parents (Superman defying Jor-El and interfering with human history), and good old fashioned romance.  The acting is also on a much higher level than one would expect in a film of this type, particularly from Reeve, who clearly delineates the roles of Clark Kent/Superman - for once the difference is more than just a pair of glasses.  (Watch the scene where Clark, at Lois Lane's apartment considers telling her of his other identity.  When Reeve takes off Clark's glasses and Superman's PRESENCE fills the room, that's the best special effect in the film - and it's all in Reeve's acting.)

The visuals have held up well over the years, and look even better now that Superman's costume is consistently BLUE during his flybys.  (It occasionally turned green during the original theatrical run and initial video releases.)  A few of the miniature work near the end looks blatantly fake, just as it did in 1978.  But for the most part, the film is as dazzling as ever - especially the Krypton sequences.  John William's stirring score remains some of the best work submitted for film by that or any film composer.

Richard Donner is known as a director with an eclectic visual style, and that suits the various moods of this film well.  From the epic Kryptonian opening, to the rural Smallville setting, through the snappy Metropolis sequence, the director adapts his style to the script's demands - and keeps the audience entertained.

Donner was in charge of the transfer of this film to DVD, so this is his vision of Superman, without the interference of the Salkind family, who cut corners and lowered the quality of the remaining three films.  Those familiar with the theatrical and various video incarnations will be in for a surprise.  Numerous scenes not included in the theatrical release are reinstated here.  However, there is not the extreme padding of scenes as was done on the broadcast television versions put together by the Salkinds.  All the new footage enhances the movie and emphasizes the plot and the characters.  The optical elements have been scrubbed and the film has never looked better.  There are only a few moments when the film stock shows its age.

The new sound mix will be more controversial.  Many of the sound effects have been replaced and/or recreated.  This is most noticeable during the opening credits and Krypton sequences.  According to Donner, post-production on the original film was very rushed and he was never satisfied with the original mix.  But, that's the way the film has been heard for over twenty years, and longtime fans with strong memories of the film may find this mix disconcerting.  As for myself, I like the new mix, but wish an alternative soundtrack with the original mix had been included as well.

The extras on the 2-sided DVD are a joy to behold.  The three part documentary hosted by Marc McLure (Jimmy Olsen) sheds new light on the disorganized and hectic production of the film - with a great deal of unseen footage.  The screen tests of Christopher Reeve and the various candidates for Lois Lane (including Stockard Channing, Anne Archer, and of course Margot Kidder) prove that Lynn Stallmaster did an excellent job casting the film.  Trailers and other supplemental material are also included.

One complaint: Warners should do away with their ""snapper"" cases and use the ""clamshell"" style case most other studios offer.

Nevertheless, no fan will want to be without this timeless classic, refurbished and preserved for new generations of young people - and the young at heart - to marvel at.

Blu-ray update, July 2010: This film is available on Blu-ray.  I purchased a copy and can definitively say that I prefer the standard DVD version.  It's not that the image quality on the Blu-ray is lacking, quite the opposite.  The high definition reveals every flaw in the original visual effects, particularly the explosion of the planet Krypton, which was obviously filmed in front of a wrinkled backdrop.  This was not visible in theatres during the original run, nor on VHS or LD.  It was barely detectable on DVD (if you pumped up the contrast on your monitor), but it is glaringly obvious on Blu-ray, as are flaws in the flying sequences.  I'm not usually fazed by imperfect VFX, but these took me out of the story.  There are no additional features here, either.  So, stick with the DVD.",988675200,2,5636,4.8852631578947365
610140,5,6303212263,"After a few months delay, the long awaited Superman The Movie Deluxe Collection Box Set, from Creative Design Arts, is finally here.

The Movie: I was 10 years old when I first saw Superman during its original theatrical run. I remember going to see it at a neighborhood second run, 2 screen theater, in late August 1979. The movie has stayed with me ever since. It was the first film, I saw that helped me to choose a career path, into adulthood. Directed by Richard Donner, the film, has it all. The origin of The Man Of Steel has been told many times over the years in print and on screen. But few have had the size and scope of this film. The planet Krypton is doomed. In order for his infant son to survive, scientist Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sends him to Earth in a small starship. Once on our world, he is found and raised by Jonathan (Glenn Ford) and Martha Kent (Phylis Thaxter). As a teenager, young Clark Kent (Jeff East), soon discovers that he has ""powers beyond those of mortal men"". Once the adult Clark (Christopher Reeve) moves to the city of Metropolis, he lands a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet, and Superman soon reveals himself to the world. This as the diabolical Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) hatches a plot that means the death of millions. At its center, Reeve keeps things ""real"", and it's his performance as our hero that makes me ""Believe A Man Can Fly, not the special effects. Donner takes nothing for granted in his direction. The film has some broadness to it, but it never gets out of hand, or gets too campy The movie has influence filmmakers. Most noteworthy, of course, is Spider-Man director Sam Raimi. Everything works and Superman The Movie still sets the standard for all other Super Hero films.

The Deluxe Box Set features the same DVD that's available separately, or as part of Superman movies DVD collection. The Director's cut includes a 2001 digital transfer of the film and 8 minutes of added footage (seen first on network TV). The film looks great. The sound mix was altered a bit but isn't as bad as some have suggested. The audio commentary by Donner and ""Creative Consultant"" (writer) Tom Mankiewicz is really very good. Get the real inside scoop on the making of the film with 3 documentaries and 1 featurette on casting. The commentary and documentaries give viewers a good idea what it must have been like to make the movie-including the story behind Donner being fired by the producers-while making Superman II. Other extras on this 2 sided disc also include a pair of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, a vintage TV spot, an isolated music only track of composer John Williams' rousing score, along with a few alternate music cues, and some DVD-ROM only material.

The box set also offers a collectable Senitype, with its corresponding film frame, a reprint of the original 20 page press campaign booklet, and a set of eight lobby card prints. Topping off the set is a 27x40 reprint of the original theatrical poster. The set comes with a folded poster that quite frankly, is a pretty silly idea, if you ask me. If you feel the same way I do, for a small shipping and handling fee, you can have a rolled version of the same poster sent to you that looks ""Super"" in a frame.

Superman The Movie is a classic that's been with me for a long time. Despite being made before the advent of CGI-the film holds up, and stands the test of time. The Deluxe Box Set is a must if you like the film as much as I do",988675200,,3461,4.515151515151516

I had heard rumors that there were extra scenes never seen before and that those scenes would be on the DVD.  But I thought to my self, ""would they be inserted into the film or simply pushed off onto a side menu"" (ala Austin Powers).  I was delighted to see the answer was both.  The movie is presented in its spectacular, original form.  Deleted scenes added in.  The quality of the transfer is breath taking.  And John Williams score comes through in beautiful digital clarity.  The movie flows so much nicer with the added scenes.  Another treat are the 3 ""making of..."" documentaries.  Ever wondered how they made Christopher Reeve fly almost 15 years ago.  The secret is at long last revealed.  However, I think the best part of the DVD is the interview with Christopher Reeve.

It also includes Dolby Surround Sound, and trailers.
The movie itself is worth the money for the DVD.  It is loaded with two time Academy Award winners Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando and has an array of other great actors that round out this movie magnificently.

610143,5,6303212263,"So why is this so good eh? Well the other reviews tell you the story line but the amazing thing about this is that: 1) This film was produced around 1978, and when you consider this the special effects are really outstanding. 2) It has one of the best film scores of all time in dolby! 3) It has arguably the best Superman actor of all time - Christopher Reeve 4) It has some phenomonal DVD extras including Christopher Reeves' screen test, why Margot Kidder deserved to be Lois Lane, and one of the best additional screens (fire and ice) since the Aliens special edition.
The film was superbly written, and linked flawlessly to Superman II (lets hope a special edition for this one is on it's way too), Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando are also brilliant.  But then the whole cast play their parts so well...
And most importantly, although the film has a little fun it doesn't become childish, it keeps to a mature level (shame about III and IV - but then the same thing happened to the Batman and Robocop sequels).  They could do to Superman I and II in the same way Star Wars was recently brought back to the cinema as a whole generation have missed the chance to see these two films the way they should be seen - but the DVD makes up for this.
This is truely a classic and if you watch it with this in mind, you will enjoy it, the ""who's got you"" scene is classic (notice the ""I don't think so"" look from Christopher Reeve at the phone box, Supermans traditional ""changing room"") and John Williams score is a masterpiece (especially the scene noted here).

610166,5,6303212263,"At last, Superman is presented the way it was meant to be! The master print for the 1978 classic had deteriorated so badly that the film, particularly the white-on-white Krypton opening scenes, was almost unwatchable. (I had even gone so far as to write a critique on Amazon.com demanding a 'Director's Cut' DVD edition, digitally transferred and remastered, be made!)
  Somebody was listening! While this isn't a 'Director's Cut' (Donner has said that the version that premiered in 1978 was the version he preferred), the movie has been expanded, to include a couple of brief scenes with Brando, and the famous Superman Gauntlet sequence at Luthor's underground lair (the remaining unused sequences can be seen in the 'Deleted Scenes' Chapter, on Side 2).
Technically, the DVD is fabulous; the Krypton sequences are now clean and sharp, a couple of shots where, previously, color balancing problems had turned Superman's costume green have been corrected, and, best of all, the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and sounds even better than it did in 1978!
Three fabulous documentaries are included on Side 2 about the making of the film, and how the flying effects were achieved. This was an incredibly expensive and difficult film to make (so much so that Donner, after 'Superman' was released to rave reviews, was fired, and replaced by Richard Lester, for 'Superman 2'), and through interviews with Donner, Christopher Reeve (who is honored for his work in the film, and his courage since his crippling accident), Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and several of the creative team, you can appreciate what a unique and wonderful film this is!
Two other 'pluses'; a full-length audio commentary track with Richard Donner, and a 'music only' option, where you can admire one of composer John Williams' greatest scores!

You get to see Superman's father, Jor-El (played by an astonishing Marlon Brando), and you also get to see how his earlier life had been before he wore the red cape and blue. And no one could ask for a better Superman than Christopher Reeve. Reeve just blows the competition out of the water as the Man of Steel. Also, ""Superman"" has some comic relief from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Ned Beatty as his bumbling sidekick, Otis. But also, this film has a soft side when Superman falls for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). This is the ultimate Superman movie for years to come, with action, romance, laughs, and a great storyline, this movie has it all. And the top-notch directing from Richard Donner (before ""Lethal Weapon"") has never been better. Also the special features on the DVD are outstanding!! Especially the screen tests, trailers, and the deleted scenes. I urge anyone out there to OWN THIS FILM, whether it's on DVD or VHS, own it!

610169,5,6303212263,"What a great movie. It is an epic, and the pretenders which have come in its wake pale in comparison. Another reviewer opines that this is but only ""one of the best adaptations of a comic book"". It is more hopeful than the incredibly dark Batman series. I, for one have never seen better in this genre, and defy anyone to come up with its equal.
You don't have to have Seinfeld's enthusiasm for Superman to find some magic in this movie. One word dominates the adjectives many reviewers use : Spirit. It is a joy to watch.
This story from the DC Comics is thankfully restored to its original glory by director Richard Donner, who indeed does have an incredibly command of the story-telling ability necessary to compress the whole Superman story into two and a half hours. Donner has us hooked from the wonderful opening: We see a young child (who could be any of us) reading from the opening pages of the original 1938 Action Comics issue that launched The Man Of Steel. Then we see over The Daily Planet building from that same period.
The restored footage is superb, and should never have come out. The additional time on Krypton, as well as the entry into Lex Luthor's lair would have been well worth keeping in the original, and it is nice to see them restored. Seeing Noel Neill and Kirk Alyn (meaningful to those of us who remember ""The Adventures of Superman"" from television) on the train Superboy runs past is a nice touch, showing homage to the series.
There are a whole host of other wonderful little touches. We expect nothing less than to see young Clark Kent eating Cheerios back in Smallville. The dialogue is as snappy as the prose Perry White extols. Wonderful is the scene of Superman's arrival in Metropolis. The helicopter crashes, and Clark Kent looks for a place to change. He walks up to what used to be a phone booth (now, in the late 1970's two pieces of plexiglas open to all) and seeing no place to change, his look says ""damn"". Then, the greatest compliment of all from a local pimp (the first earthling to see him in costume): ""Say, Jim, that's a BAD out-fit!"" When Superman catches a falling Lois Lane and reassures her of her safety, she has a great line: ""You've got me, but who's got YOU"".
Wonderful supporting work by all. Ned Beatty does great work as bumbling sidekick Otis, and Jackie Cooper is Perry White. However, the award for first among equals must go to Gene Hackman, who showed his versatility as Lex Luthor, The Greatest Criminal Mind Of Our Time. His lines, looks and attitude are worth the price of the disc.
So what if a few of the plot turns were implausible! Yeah, I guess one could not reverse the earth's rotation backwards, and thereby make time go in reverse. Maybe one cannot ""seal"" the San Andreas Fault. But what the hell, if you can suspend your imagination to the point of a flying man, why not cover these little tricks too? And if you cannot suspend your imagination, this is not the movie to see.
For the rest of us, happily not so afflicted, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours.",987984000,,3053,4.4928057553956835
610170,5,6303212263,"The movie itself is worthy of the five stars, and no doubt the DVD version lives up its hype.  After years of watching the fuzzy pan & scan monstrosity that was the video version of the movie, I rushed to see SUPERMAN at a midnight movie house near me when they ran one of the prints WB sent out for their 75th birthday a couple of years ago.  It holds up so well -- the scenes in Krypton dole out backstory with ease and Brando adds dramatic weight (ahem) as Jor El.  The Smallville scenes are touching.  The Daily Planet feels real.  Superman's first night out saving the rampaging chopper is a brilliant action sequence.  Supe and Lois' night time flight through the clouds is haunting (with just the right note of camp in Kidder's voice over).  The introduction to Lex Luther / Otis / Miss Tesmacher is just the right shot of comedy to pick up the second half of the movie.  The finale is an awesomely impressive combination of effects and personal drama.  Christopher Reeve is scary good with his roaring grief over Lois' near-death.  This one, unlike the others that followed, has an actual MESSAGE that tracks throughout the story about the dangers of Supe intervening in the course of human events.  The performances are dead on -- Kidder is so good its amazing she didn't become a huge actress after this.  Hackman is infinitely better than Nicholson in BATMAN (which does NOT hold up).

By this time, everyone should know how Superman came to earth, and the stunning SFX make the sequence really fun. The plot is relatively simplistic. Lex Luthor plans to drop 20 megaton bomb onto the San Andreas Fault, causing all of California to sink. This will allow the expansive desert he has purchased to become the new coast, hence, Lex will becom stinking rich from tourist's money.

610172,5,6303212263,"i think mr. reeves performance of the superman/clark kent character is a just example of acting genius. he plays both ends of the spectrum with such convincing feeling, its almost incredible. on one hand, he is a bumbling nerd who is constantly stumbling over his own two feet or his tounge. on the other hand, he plays a strong, courageous yet humanly humble man who makes you believe not only in him, but believing in yourself, as well. i also think this movie is priceless because of the mechanics of the movie itself. the other reviewers are right.. any cartoon/comic hero is judged solely on the critera set forth by superman the movie. i look at movies like the batman movies, where the movie is set almost as a living comic book, and where you cant see any way at all that this movie could take place in real life. to be honest, it makes me ill. this is by far the best comicbook based movie i have ever seen, because everytime i see it, i look up in the sky, hoping to see that blue, red and yellow costume swoop by, letting me know that everything is right with the world. warner bros is coming out with a show this fall of 2001 called ""smallville"", which will be a dawsons creek type teen show dealing with the problems and feelings of a 15 year old freshman in high school, who 1) feels alone in the world because he is 15, and 2) has to deal with all these new and strange powers that are developing. this series, upon success, is supposed to be a springboard for a new superman movie. i just hope and pray that its not a ""living comicbook"" type program like lois and clark, or any batman movie not starring micheal keaton. i hope clark/superman is protrayed in the same awesomely inspiring yet humbling light as he is protrayed by christopher reeve. this movie is highly recommended.",984096000,,1796,4.429003021148036
610173,5,6303212263,"Last night a friend that works at Warner Brothers brought over a surprise: The Superman-The Movie two disc DVD! And after watching it, I've got some good news, and some bad news.
First the good news- This new version is even better that the original edit of the film. A lot more of Marlon Brando's scenes. And the really cool sequence in Lex Luthor's underground hide out where he tries to kill Superman with bullets, fire & cold. Plus more...
The picture quality is just stunning. Krypton has this insane glow to it. And the new sound rivals brand new movies. The music is bright & vibrant, swirling all around you, and the entire 5.1 mix is used very well.
Now, the bad news- There's only the one version of the movie. I had hoped you'd be able to play the original, too.
More good news- The second disc has an enormous amount of brand new special features (almost two hours worth.) In their entirety, they seem to transport you back in time to relive the fascinating story of how the two Superman movies got made--up until director Richard Donner was stupidly fired, and not brought back to finish the second film. There's a lot of never-been-seen before, behind-the-scenes footage. In the casting tests you can see early versions of the Superman costume as Chris Reeve plays against many actresses including Leslie Warren, Anne Archer (both who were very good,) and of course Margot Kidder.
And then there are the two exceptional documentaries with new interviews from almost everybody. They follow the history of the two films, and include very interesting business aspects. Chris Reeves' story is very touching.  Also included is a documentary on the special effects with neat(!) early flying tests.
Now more bad news- My friend took the discs with her.
To some up: this is the most complete, classy & top notch DVD package I have ever seen. Very well done !  A+",982800000,87,1868,4.709480122324159
610174,5,6303212263,"The moment you hear John Williams opening score, you'll be engrossed in this film.  Arguably, SUPERMAN is the greatest superhero movie ever made (and coincidentally the first movie I ever saw), and definitely one of the last epics to ever hit the silver screen.  Making people take Superman seriously is the hardest task anyone making a comic-related film has ever encountered.  However, director Richard Donner succeeded where eveyone else would've failed by taking the road less travelled, and focused on the mythos of the Last Son of Krypton, and all the empathic human emotions contained within.  Consequently, he set the standard by which all comic-related movies were to be judged for the next 23 years (and beyond)!
Few recognize, however, that the movie itself helped force the special effects genre into overdrive.  Before SUPERMAN, no one had attempted to truly integrate blue screen effects (even Lucas)with traditional prop special effects.  More importantly, they had never dared to do blue screen in daylight images (due to the black outline and unsteady color caused by the film of the time).  Most importantly, utilizing a person in these images meant movement, something space ships didn't offer up as a problem.  By the time SUPERMAN II came along, the challenges were even greater, including creating an entire city street to destroy!
From beginning to end, SUPERMAN is a legendary fantasy-epic, wherein the Man of Steel ultimately turns his back upon the knowledge of his ancestors in order to save the life of his love, Lois Lane, by turning back time.  Created in an age of art & innocence, SUPERMAN ignores the depressing scientific jargon-babble of today's trekky movies, and refuses to drag you down with over-complicated premises.  Instead, it engages you in a fairy tale come to life (more fantasy than sci-fi).  Simply put:  SUPERMAN may very well be the most FUN movie of all time.",982800000,6,1910,5.086538461538462

There were some nics/scratchs in several scenes.  I wish they used some software to clean up the problems (ala Criterion Collection).  The sound was good, B+.  Some of the split surround effects were a tad over used.  Example: When Lex Luther breaks the glass map of the world, is it necessary to hear the shards falling behind me when the action is in front???  I wish the DVD contained the original audio mix.  The commentary with Richard Donner was very interesting.  He went into a lot of detail about specific scenes and the difficulties he had with the producers.  The 5.1 music-only wasn't so hot (pity).

Batman, X-Men, Blade, Spider-Man... *this* is the standard all the rest have to measure up to.

610232,5,6303212263,"Movies based on superheroes are usually very entertaining.  Some of the Batman films and the recent ""X-Men"" have proved that, but even they can't compare to the epic splendor of the first ""Superman"" film.  Director Richard Donnor of the ""Lethal Weapons"" and ""Goonies"" released this film in 1978 to rave reviews and huge box office.  It was one of the most anticipated films of it's time, I'm sure if you were to ask anyone who's old enough they could tell you about the first time they saw ""Superman: The Movie"" in the theaters and what a treat it was.
""Superman: The Movie"" is a glorious fantasy/adventure full of clever villians, inventive visual effects, huge sets, wonderful music by John Williams, romance, and unexpected humor.  The film closer resembles the spirit of ""Star Wars"" than the thundering action of the ""Batman"" films.  ""Superman"" is a comic book movie, yes, but it's more than that.  For starters, no comic book movie has ever had such faith in it's premise than in ""Superman"".  The film is almost a history lesson for us, taking us back to the origins of the hero on the planet Krypton and following him through his adolescence in Smallville and eventually to his arrival in Metropolis.  Richard Donner has such command of the storytelling here.  He treats the story of ""Superman"" with such respect in placing the Man of Steel in the so-called real world instead of the phony sets that you might come to expect in a film called ""Superman"".  Since Donner gives us a realistic setting, the heroics of Superman are viewed with greater awe by the people of Metropolis, as well as the viewing audience.
The greatest praise however rests on the invulnerable shoulders of the man who dons the red cape on screen; Christopher Reeve.  While playing what is essentially a dual role in Clark Kent and Superman, Reeve makes the presence of these characters more effective by giving Clark an off-beat personality and Superman a HEART of steel.  Reeve's Superman is more of a friend than a hero.  He's just a kind man with incredible powers who wants to make the world a better place.  Reeve's spin on the character makes the big S more sympathetic and even human.  Reeve has great fun playing the two personalities off each other.  Even through Clark's feeble dorkiness, you can still sense the intelligent hero hiding behind the glasses and even when Superman romances reporter Lois Lane you sense his vulnerbility and love for her and when he mourns for her we realize that he's more like us than a comic book hero.
While not a hulk-like figure which the early concepts of Superman indicated in the comics, Reeve still provides a powerful prescence proving that it's heart not muscle which makes a true hero.  A cape doesn't hurt though.
Facing off against the Man of Steel is the mighty Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Hackman's Luthor is one of the screen's greatest film villians.  An evil super genius with world domination on the brain, Luthor is also quite funny. Hackman gives Luthor a spoiled brat quality but also a lethal seriousness with his scenes with Christopher Reeve.  This is an awesome screen rivalry.
The music by John Williams is one of his best scores ever if not THE best.  The effects and design of the film make it totally belivable that a man is flying around trying to save the world, and all other technical aspects of the film are first rate.
""Superman"" is for the kid in us all and for those who still believe in heroes.  A classic filled with affectionate performances, stand up and cheer adventure and wonder which is owed to skilled directon and a terrific lead performance by Christopher Reeve, the one and only Superman.",976060800,12,3660,4.739747634069401

610234,5,6303212263,"The amazing thing about Superman the movie was its timing at a point during the Carter malaise when America needed to be reminded that we are at our best when we stand for the truth and take our lumps. What the film does is take you on a roller-coaster ride of time and space to re-establish Superman in the present-day--this is necessary for us to ""believe a man can fly"". We certainly needed this done for us in 1978 when we were fed a steady diet of ""limits"" and ""can't do"".
The beauty of the film is how the movie has an ambitious agenda and it doesn't flinch and be content to stop; when Superman arrives into the city he immediately responds to a flurry of crises as a real super-hero or a real leader would. The most amazing scene is when Superman Christopher Reeve flies into Lois Lane's upper floor apartment without a camera cut and converts into Clark Kent, or was it vice-a-versa? Either way I can't see any breaks in the action. As his reputation for goodness spreads, his leadership is challenged by a cunning criminal played by the incomparable Gene Hackman. Lex Luthor figures out that Superman can't be in two places at once, and gives him an impossible disaster to prevent, when the choice he makes results in the woman he loves dying, you realize the extent Superman is willing to go to protect us. That's what we admire and respect in a leader.
I like what happens next. Its been repeated since in other films in other ways, but Superman refuses to accept the triumph of evil and wills Lois Lane back to life, and its true in so many instances in real life that if you are refuse to give in to defeat, regroup and take another stab at the problem afresh goodness will triumph in the end. Superman reminds us if we are Superhuman beings we will have a life full of challenges, and by helping other people we will be at our best. This is the central paradox, some say a ""menage a trois"": Lois Lane loves Superman when he really is Clark Kent; when she overcomes her cynicism in later films to realize that its possible for Clark Kent to be Superman its a wonderful thing. Like the film, ""Its a wonderful life"" the Clark Kents of this world who keep it together for little reward or fanfare are the real super heroes!",970444800,3,2234,4.411622276029056

I had been a Superman fan for several years, and was absolutely thrilled by the whole thing.  The promotional ads at the  time said that the movie would ""make you believe a man can fly,""  and that's exactly what it did.  I watched this movie several more times  during my pre-teen and teen years, but then I went several years without  watching it.  Then, in my late twenties, I decided to buy a copy of it on  tape so I could watch it anytime I wanted.  Well, I put that tape in for  the first time in years, and it completely grabbed me all over again.  The  scene in the wheat field where he told Ma Kent he had to leave almost made  me cry and I NEVER CRY AT MOVIES!  There was something about seeing it as  an adult that made it even more special.  In other words, this is not just  a movie for kids!

The problem I have with this VHS version is that too much is  cropped off on the peripheral ends of the screen.  The panning-n-scanning  of the camera becomes trite and tiresome after awhile since this  ""modified to fit your screen"" version compensates to take the  viewer to where the action is.
Patiently waiting for a widescreen/DVD  version would be beneficial in appreciating this excellent movie classic.  I have seen the letterbox version from laser disc, and it is spectacularly  panoramic by comparison!  Rumor has it that Warner Bros. is planning a  25th Anniversary re-release of ""Superman - The Movie"" for 2003.  Perhaps this will also mean re-implementing the 48 minutes(!) that was cut  from the theatrical release of 1978, but restored and aired (only once!) on  ABC in 1982.  That means this movie is actually a little over 3  adventuresome hours long.

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  Opening on Krypton, the films follows the Man of Steel as he's sent to

Earth where he develops his alter-ego Clark Kent and is raised by a Midwestern family. In no time, the movie runs through his teenage years, and Clark gets a job at the Daily Planet, where he is a news reporter. It's there that he falls in love with Lois Lane, who is already in love with Superman. But the love story is quickly sidetracked once the villainous Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan to conquer the world and kill Superman.",954720000,,1298,6.141176470588236

610318,5,6303212263,"One of the grandest movies of all time!  Christopher Reeve made his screen debut in the role he would be forever identified. And with good reason.  He IS Superman!  His presence as both Clark Kent and his superhero  alter ego is astoundingly realistic when you consider the fantasy elements  of the story!  He is so real, he simply transcends the screen!  And when  you first see Superman take off, swoop over the camera and fly out of his  ""fortress of solitude"" your breath is taken away by the  believibility of it all.
As good as Reeve is, I would be remiss to ignore  the fine performances by the rest of the cast.  Marlon Brando is excellent  as Jor-El.  His time on screen is brief but very worthwhile.  No other  actor could have done as well.  The farewell speech he gives to his son  before sending him on the long journey to earth is very moving and is  reminiscent of at least one biblical passage.  Margot Kidder is very  convincing as Lois Lane.  She makes you believe she is a street wise  reporter who would do anything for a scoop.  Jackie Cooper as the crusty  Perry White is hilarious, particularly when he is reprimanding Jimmy Olsen  as he is putting an order in for coffee: ""And don't call me  sugar"".  Ned Beatty as Otis displays more versatility as an actor in a  role unlike anything he has ever played.  He is very funny.  But chief  among them all and definitely the man from Krypton's equal is S.man's  nemesis, Lex Luthor, portrayed here with equal parts humor and villainy by  the great Gene Hackman.  He should have received a Oscar nomination.
From  start to finish this film is an incredible journey that never leaves the  audience feeling empty.  From the opening scenes on Krypton, through the  last shot of Reeve flying by the camera and smiling as if to say,  ""Don't worry, it's only a movie"", you are never disappointed.  Only the heartless viewer would be unmoved as Clark Kent says goodbye to  his earthly mother.  The scene is beautifully acted and photographed.  And  when Kent first arrives at the Daily Planet there are several good laughs  as Clark is obviously trying to adjust to his dual persona in attempting to  create an image of the klutz.  Once again excellent performing from Mr.  Reeve!
Richard Donner directs with a sure hand this film that has  everything-belly laughs, edge-of-your-seat excitement, heartwarming drama  and spectacle.  A great script by Mario (THE GODFATHER) Puzo certainly  contributes to the proceedings!  John Williams provides what is one of  his finest music scores and captures all of the many moods of this  incredible movie.
Like so many others, this reviewer is hoping for the  release of the completely restored version with all of the excised footage.  This version is quite an improvement over the already superb, familiar  release and deserves a wide-screen edition on ALL video formats.  Let's  hope we will see it soon.

Richard Donner's take on the the Man of Steel is a bit overlong, but is terrific, and features a wonderful cast, particularly young Christopher Reeve, who gives Superman a dignity not seen since George Reeves portrayed him, in the 1950s.
The  special effects are, for the most part, exceptional, particularly when you  consider that the digital technology we enjoy today was nonexistant in  1978. (It's for this very reason that George Lucas 'remade' Star Wars; we  can enjoy 'miracles' on screen today, thanks to the advancements of the  last few years.) The flying sequences have an airy poetry that had never  been seen in any live action 'Superman' prior to this film.
The problem  in S:TM lies in the quality of the master that the video transfers are  being made from. It has aged, and deteriorated considerably over the last  22 years. What compounds the problem is that the 'Krypton' sequence opening  the film was shot 'white on white', which shows the flaws and cracks on the  acetate master worse than any other color combination.
This is a  suggestion to Warner Bros...Create a remastered, cleaned-up original,  featuring the deleted scenes (which were aired when the movie was  'expanded' for its first television run), all the trailers, include the  'Making of' documentary, hosted by Reeves, that aired when the film was  first released, add in an audio track with commentary by Donner, Reeve, and  Hackman (getting Brando to participate is too much to hope for!), include  an 'audio only' track of John Williams' fabulous score. Those of us who love this film  (and there are a LOT of us!) would shell out the money for this truly  'special' presentation, and future generations would be able to see  'Superman' the way he was MEANT to be seen!",950572800,6,1804,4.868421052631579
610320,2,6303212263,"I wtrote this review several months ago but somehow it got dropped off. Superman The Movie is a great movie, one of my favorites, that deserves to be restored digitally in widescreen format. But this version is horribly  disappointing!  I bought the most expensive VHS I could find online,  which was this clamshell version, to try to get widescreen (this was before  you could get full descriptions). I left it in shrinkwrap until I was ready  to see it again. What a disappointment! The video quality of this copy was  washed out and has so many dust spots, scratches, and other flaws that it  looks as though someone went to a second run theater and just videoed a  tired old screening. I have a high-quality VCR & TV on which other VHS  tapes look awesome. Wait for a remastered version!",949276800,5,791,4.5928571428571425
610321,5,6303212263,"I should point out that this review is for the wide screen version of the video which I managed to track down a few years ago. If ever a film was deserving of a remastered DVD transfer this is it - current rumours have an  DVD ETA for end of year 2000.
From the rousing opening credits which  features, in my humble opinion, the best movie theme ever written - sorry  Mr. Lucas, but I'm afraid Mr. Williams out-scored himself for this one -  through to it's cliffhanging climax this motion picture has it all. Great  cinematography, superb performances - special mention must go to  Christopher Reeve who played both roles to perfection -, a top notch script  courtesy of Mario 'Godfather' Puzo and confident direction from the, at  times uneven, Richard 'The Omen/Lethal Weapon 1/2/3/4' Donner. The special  effects have stood the test of time very well indeed and, despite some  dodgy blue-screen work, you WILL believe a man can fly. In fact if you  compare the flying sequences from this movie to the subsequent sequels you  will notice a dramatic deterioration from 1st to 4th - this in itself is a  testament to the amount of work put into the original.
So there you have  it, whether you are a sceptical first-time viewer, a fan of the whole  Superman mythology or just an ardent movie lover this is one film that more  than holds it's own against today's inferior plagiarists.

610365,5,6303212263,"People who consider this to be a ""children's movie"" probably a) never saw the movie, or b) saw it many years back when they were kids, and hence, could not fully appreciate the magnitude of the film's achievement.
The biggest hurdle was to convince viewers that ""this is no  fantasy"", as Marlon Brando states in the film's opening line. This  immersion is partly due to an ingenius screenplay, which essentially  portrays Superman as an orphan who discovers his destiny to be the Savior.  All the actors give brilliant performances, especially Reeve in his dual  role, Hackman (as Luthor), Kidder (as Lois Lane), and Glenn Ford (as Pa  Kent).
The prologue, although quite long, is not to be missed.  Blazing  credits are pitted against the backdrop of beautiful photography and a  glorious John Williams score. Keep the volume on high with stereo surround  speakers to fully enjoy the introduction and for the musical cues  throughout the movie as well. The special effects, by and large, are still  very impressive. None more so than the famous helicopter sequence, which is  perhaps the greatest rescue in cinematic history. The flying effects that  were done in-camera are also remarkable.
My only criticism is that a  controversial plot development towards the very end of the movie injects a  dose of unnecessary science fiction, which contrasts the realism that is so  constant throughout.
Director Richard Donner met the challenge of making  us believers. The movie gives us a ""human"" superhero who we  really care about and admire. ""Superman"" has a timeless appeal  for all generations and age groups.
Also worth noting for those who  can't get enough of Reeve: a couple of very dramatic scenes surprisingly  did not make the editor's cut and can only be seen in the extended version,  which runs an extra 40 minutes. The film is set to be re-mastered for DVD  release sometime late in 2000. A 2003 theatrical re-release is being  considered for its 25th anniversary.

Clark Kent may be seen  as a little too wimpy, Otis may be too extreme of a doofus, but they are  surrounded by characters who manage to be wholly credible.  Kudos to Mario  Puzo for his script and story (he also worked on Superman II, and his  absence was noticed on III and IV: The Quest for Peace) The only other  possibly superior interpretation of The Man of Steel is the first season of  Lois and Clark. But still, a movie of this much grandeur and spectacle,  which is superior in every way to all of the Batman movies combined (sorry,  Tim.

610400,5,6303212263,"Rarely does one find a film whose quality is of such a grand scale as to be difficult to quantify.  We finmd such a film in Superman - The Movie.

Director Richard Donner literally and figuratively had the word  Verisimilitude plastered all over the various locales used in shooting the  film, to hammer home the point that the film required genuine  verisimilitude.  The crew got the hint, and delivered a film that remains  powerful.

The opening is a clever mix of inauspiciousness and epic; a  child reads the opening pages of the original 1938 Action Comics issue that  launched The Man Of Steel; we then fly over The Daily Planet building circa  1938, reach space, and are then confronted with the awe-inspiring sliding  names and words that make up the film's opening credits.  The credit  sequence is worth discussing because it alone is worth the price of the  film, from John Williams' tremendous Superman theme (here presented with  increased reverb) to the clever mixture of lights and solar waves as the  audience is transported through space.

Finally the film begins in earnest  on the planet Krypton, a world populated by humans whose molecular  structure has been changed due to the radiation of the planet's crimson  central star.  Krypton is doomed because its sun is pulling it out of orbit  onto a collision course, but the ruling quorom pay no heed to the warnings  of its greatest scientist, Jor-El (people have put the rap on Marlon  Brando's performances over the years, but here he shines).  Joe-El  nonetheless builds a starship so that his infant son, Kal-El, can be  transported to Earth, a planet orbiting a yellow sun whose radiation will  allow his molecular density to make him strong, fast, and all but  invulnerable.

The destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's journey to Earth  are harrowingly presented, and culminate in the crash-landing of the  starship onto a field near the Kansas village of Smallville.  The impact  blows a tire on the truck of local farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent  (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford), and as they stop to repair it, they see  the meteor bearing the small child.

And so it goes, until some eighteen  years later.  The boy, Clark Kent (played by Jeff East in the Smallville  sequence with Christopher Reeve's voice dubbed in), finds the spire and is compelled to travel to the North Pole (this following a tearful goodbye to his Earth mother),  where the spire creates a huge crystaline fortress.  Within this Fortress  Of Solitude, the spirit of Jor-El summons his son through the boundaries of  space, where he evolves into an adult being, bearing the S-shaped crest of The House Of El amid the now-familiar blue and red costume and  cape.

Christopher Reeve now takes over, and the film nicely relaxes from  the love and pain that permeate its first third.  Clark Kent is played a  bit too broadly, coming off more as a doofus than a believable person - this is due to Reeve's interpretation of Kent as in the mold of Cary Grant's comedic persona.  But  when Kent changes to his super-powered alter ego, Reeve shines, presenting  him as authoritative, but not excessively so.  He pulls off a series of  acts, saving lives and stopping crimes, that excite the world and lead him  to be dubbed Superman.

In comes criminal lord Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).  Mysteriously deducing Superman's weakness from a National Geographic photo  of a meteorite, Luthor traps Superman to prevent him from pulling off  ""the greatest real estate swindle of all time"" via sabotaged  nuclear missiles intended to detonate the San Andreas Fault and set off an  earthquake that will collapse the West Coast into the Pacific Ocean.

Superman's battle to stop the missiles and stop the ensuing quake  involve some of the best SFX ever put to screen, between the tremendously  effective flying sequences (this is the only Superman film to speed up  backgrounds to present the look and feel of flying at light speed), the  amazing sequence where Superman flies UNDER the California coast to move  the enormous landmass back into place, saving a teetering bus, saving a  train running headlong to a collapsed spur, and trying to stop a flood from  the collapse of Hoover Dam.

Not only will you believe a man can fly,  you'll wish all of it could happen in real life.  Such is the enduring  power of Superman.",935020800,4,4356,4.851092896174864

Director Richard Donner captures the essence of what it means to be a hero in his 1978 classic film Superman. It's an absolutely beautiful movie that holds up to this day. Every superhero film that came after Superman has tried to emulate it. Richard Donner's focused direction, stunning cinematography, creative sets, iconic costumes, innovative practical effects, believable mini models, brilliant cast, emotional acting, Mario Puzo's genius script, and John Williams' legendary score. Superman is perhaps the greatest superhero film of all time.

This film demonstrates what an ideal hero could strive to embody. Mario Puzo's screenplay is filled with heartfelt messages of hope and wonder. The guiding moral principles of a good person are on display as delivered by Marlon Brando's Jor-El, the loving father figure to Superman. His words of wisdom not only educate Kal-El, but serve as the founding guidelines of heroism for Superman. It's a brilliant way to tell the audience what Superman is all about, while bestowing Kal-El himself with important knowledge and ethics. The writing of Superman holds up today because Puzo wrote a universally good parable that focuses on character development. It's a wonderful feast of origin story and quotable lines.

John Williams' score is as iconic as any movie music that you will ever hear. Superman's theme is triumphant, inspiring, joyous, rousing, and instantly recognizable. The symphony soars across your speakers will the sweet swell of a lovely orchestra performance. I would imagine that every audience member that watches Superman will be humming the theme for the rest of the day as you remember its sounds for the rest of your life. Williams achieves the incredible by composing a truly timeless score for Superman.

The entire cast is perfectly suited for their respective roles. Christopher Reeve as Superman is as warm and empathetic as ever. I love Reeve as Superman for his passion for the character. He clearly understood how complex Superman is as a character. As Kal-El the alien from Krypton, he must isolated. As Clark Kent the reporter, he must appear meek and unassuming, yet still kind. As Superman the hero, Reeve must play him powerful, helpful, and thoughtful. Reeve respects all of these heroic facets with graceful, subtle acting. Reeve's Superman symbolizes justice, kindness, and an overall goodwill towards men that will surely inspire hope when you see him.

Gene Hackman's villainous Lex Luthor is as conniving, clever, and cruel as I remember upon first seeing Superman as a child. Hackman is as hilarious as his henchman Otis, who bumbles and stumbles his way into your heart as the delightful comedy relief in Superman. Hackman eats up the scenery as Lex Luthor in every scene. He's calm and in control except when he's screaming his blood boiling yell at his cronies. It's a very fun performance that families of all ages will enjoy, yet remain in awe of his fierce depravity. Hackman portrays the greedy megalomaniac with vile dreams of being a real estate tycoon lording over the property of those in poverty. He's quite reprehensible. In essence, Hackman's Luthor is the perfect foil for Superman's good nature. Superman contains one of Gene Hackman's finest roles.

You must watch Superman. I recommend Donner's movie not because it is iconic, but because it has earned its reverence. I hold Superman in the highest esteem as a movie brave enough to be sincere about being good. It's a highly entertaining film that has withstood the test of time. Superman is superb!",1524096000,,3575,5.144578313253012
