A wonderful way to start your day!!",1378166400,4,194,4.735294117647059
5680223,5,B00BX9ADE0,Her technique produces amazing results and is very enjoyable to do.  Her explanations put a whole new perspective on exercise.  I am getting a body that I never thought was possible and feel years younger.,1374883200,40,205,4.828571428571428
5680224,5,B00BX9ADE0,Love this. It is amazing how a stretch workout can work you so hard.  I always feel so good afterwards.,1373932800,5,103,4.15
5680225,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I found Miranda over two years ago channel surfacing one more.  It caught my eye because it was something anyone can do and it was 23 minutes.  I started  doing it every morning at 6am and just two short weeks i felt amazing.  I am a massage therapist and on my feet using my body every day, so I need to stay in shape.  After six months the results were incrediable.  The shape of my body changed and I had lost weight.  Two years later, I do this almost every morning.  If i miss a few days my body tells me very quickly.  And the best testement, I was recently in a car accident and broke a rib, of course I could not do my normal routine, but I truly believe that I healed so quickly because of doing classical stretch.  Try this and give yourself the gift of Health",1372464000,184,770,4.073333333333333
5680226,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Miranda has developed a zero-impact aerobic workout with emphasis on flexibility, strength, and reduction of pain.  I'm in my mid-sixties and feel strong and energetic.  My back pain is managed successfully.  I also have Season 7 and have been practicing her technique for 8 months now.",1371859200,65,286,5.173913043478261
5680227,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Both my husband and I are such a fan of the classical stretch series. We discovered it on PBS, we are now addicted. The workout is extremely effective. Each workout is 20 minutes duration, the collection has 30 workouts. It is a combination of stretch and strength with movement. You must try it, there is nothing like her workout anywhere else. extremely unique and it make us feel wonderful all day. We lost weight,have more energy and again it is only 20 minutes of incredible exercise. Every morning we do the program from our local PBS station, we also bought it for the off day and when we are traveling. This program is for all ages, all body type and every fitness level.",1371600000,287,679,4.528455284552845
5680228,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I think as far as her Series goes, this has to be some of her best work. It's hard for me as I'm a Classical Stretch follower for many years. Even though each segment is appx 20 mins, it's easy to do 2 or 3 to get a full hour long workout in. I have nerve damage in my neck/shoulders/arms.. this method keeps me moving. Thanks you Miranda!  Side Note: This title is currently available at Classical Stretch for $65.00 + shipping. Well under the listed price here .. just sayin.",1367193600,121,477,4.241758241758242
5680229,4,B00BX9ADE0,"Miranda White knows what she is doing. I was starting to feel pains in my shoulders, neck and spine in the last few months and started my Kundalini yoga practice again only to experience worse pain. I bought this set a week ago and can't believe how much better I feel. I have tingling in my spine and just got a diagnosis for osteoporosis at too young an age. Her workouts and stretches in just a week have greatly improved my posture and reduced my pain. I WILL reverse my diagnosis with lifestyle, movement and diet changes. I strongly believe that Miranda will guide me on that journey.

I looooove how she explains how the body works and the why's of each movement while she moving. She explains the result or the outcome if you keep it up. She progresses fast which I really like.

The Publisher of the DVD clearly did not understand their audience. Their are four DVD''s badly labeled saying 1,2,3 &4  with the series title and nothing to correspond to the 30 workouts. A label on the sleeve would have done that. Then the wording on the DVD Menu does not correspond to the 30 workouts on the back of the box. They describe it one way on the DVD pacakage and then scramble the words on the DVD itself. It is clear that the quality and professionalism of Miranda does not equal that of her publisher. She gets FIVE STARS. I would give her publisher ONE star.",1519776000,,1364,4.404761904761905
5680230,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Miranda Edmonde-White has changed the shape of my body, minimized my aches and pains. Her technique has shown me what exercise is really for. To strengthen and heal the muscles. I am 57 years old, no more beating myself to death with hour long cardio sessions that did nothing to strengthen and elongate my muscles. She explains everything, I feel so alive after these workouts! I recommend for baby boomer.",1519603200,2,407,4.828571428571428

5680233,5,B00BX9ADE0,"This is a superior exercise routine and the benefits I have received from working the program are more than I can even describe.  Miranda Esmonde-White is a genius and I do these every single day.  If I could give 100+ stars, I would.  There are simply no words to define how grateful I am to this program.",1515542400,,306,4.333333333333333
5680234,5,B00BX9ADE0,The season 9 and 10 are my favorite workout routines. They are faster and have many varieties. All of her workouts have changed the shape of my body. I always feel great after her workout. I also love the scenery and her explanation. I don't do other types of workout now because I workout with Miranda and I look forward to exercising everyday with her. Thanks Miranda!,1515283200,,370,4.537313432835821

This has really helped me so much. I am more flexible than before and have so much more energy. Dont give up, keep at it even if the moves seem difficult, it will get better, honestly. At first I didn't like it, I thought her voice  was annoying and the exercises too hard, but I kept at it. Now I love them and really enjoy her explanations and commentary. I also love the scenery. I feel like Im working out with a wonderful friend.",1509408000,,606,3.8870967741935485

5680241,4,B00BX9ADE0,I like the exercises and they have been helpful - would appreciate the instructor more if she gave the movement instructions before the movements - sometimes difficult to follow her until you learn the routine yourself.,1505174400,,219,5.111111111111111

5680243,5,B00BX9ADE0,"This is the second in the series that we have purchased. We have found them to be just right for our purposes. You won't become a weight lifter with these. But they are great for staying healthy, limber and active in everyday living. You can participate at your own level and slowly increase the intensity of the workout. I recommend them.",1503878400,,339,4.573770491803279

5680248,3,B00BX9ADE0,"I was confused fused when I got this DVD,  and disappointed.  I have Miranda's Strengthening, Mobility, Stretching DVDs.  She always speaks about how in her program,  ALL MOVEMENTS  are to be slow.  I loved what I had,  so wanted a variety.  This DVD was just the opposite of everything I had learned from her!!  Fast passed and jumping around,  I was terribly disappointed.  I had to return.  She also is not real good about doing equal reps on her DVDs and has a tendency to bounce around with what she's doing.  I love my other DVDs of hers,  but this one was WAY to fast for me. I gave it 3 stars only because someone younger or in better shape might like it.",1495152000,5,663,4.284552845528455
5680249,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Dear God! This is a great workout. I'm new to Miranda, having done only 3 workouts.  I was sick for 20 years and couldn't exercise. I had been in the fitness industry. I bought this season and absolutely love it. This DVD has about 15 episodes of 20 minutes or so each. Starts with a warm up, goes to a deeeep stretch workout. I've done 2 episodes and feel so alive afterwards!  Nothing ever did this for me! Yoga didn't, aerobics didn't, nor weight training. It just feels so good. This is very do-able for a beginner. You can go at your own rate, but she is very encouraging to go past your limitations. My highest recommendation.",1493942400,,632,4.3931623931623935
5680250,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I am in my late fifties and I sometimes wake up feeling quite stiff and inflexible.  But I've been working out for over 40 years... shouldn't I be in great shape?  Well, it's just a fact that my body needs daily stretching.  And after doing a 25 minute Classical Stretch workout, I don't just feel normal again, I feel incredible.

I was, for years, a steady user of Season 3, but I minded that many of Miranda's workouts there heavily repeated other workout episodes, and I really minded her miscounting and uneven time on right versus left sides.  But Season 9 is a huge improvement on that.

The workouts on these 4 DVDs are really varied and really do target the areas in each chapter's title.  Most of them are total feel-good stretches, but some of them are a bit of a workout for the average Jo or Joe.  The ones I just lerrrrrrve are for the spine, posture and hips, but I was surprised to discover herein a hamstring workout that has the easiest, most wonderful pli workout, ever.  I have weak knees and really mind things like squash and quick sideways jumps to a bended knee.  Season 9 has seen me build up my knee strength like nothing else ever did.

There is a pain prevention workout that makes me feel like a million bucks, done on the mat, of all places (many Classical Stretch workouts are standing).

I do want to put in a warning for anyone who has a bad back.  There are some moves in some of the workouts where Miranda says ""maximum resistance"", meaning, if you are, say pushing out an arm and extending that push through your ribs, while moving your hands and arms in an arc in front of your body, this is way too much for me.  I have a slightly bad back (I see a chiropractor regularly) and if I really do give it my max resistance, I will put a rib out of alignment.  So I would say that Season 12 is better for someone who has a bad back, and Season 11 has the most fantastic relaxation - based workouts of them all.  There are some rather high speed and advanced workouts here, and the workouts are NOT in order from easy to hard.  It's a jumble.  You really have to go slowly and gently while you're getting to know these workouts and then keep notes on which ones make you feel the best and keep those in heavy rotation.

And, best of all, the core and abdominal workouts (there's even one in the posture workout) are actually fun.  I mean, I despise crunches.  I will not do situps except when Miranda is leading me through them.  Some of the core exercises are sneaky... you'd never know you were flattening your tummy, but you ARE.  I just love these.  Worth the price.",1493337600,4,2601,4.3264462809917354

5680254,3,B00BX9ADE0,"I saw a bit of this program on my PBS station, but never actually saw the exercises.  I SO wanted to love this program, but there's just too much explanation between stretches/movements and no background music or anything.  After watching this a few times, it will get very boring listening to the same explanations again and again. There are actually way too many DVDs and too many exercises to choose from if you're just looking for a daily routine that makes sense.  It's good to have all this info available if you have specific problems, but this just didn't work for me.",1492646400,,576,4.627450980392157

5680256,5,B00BX9ADE0,My wife made me do this - I thought it just for old people. Not really.  The workouts are tough enough and with the stretching and movement I feel much better than other workouts.  They are just long enough.  I only wish there was a guide or way to see what the workout is and what it helps in advance so I can pick the ones I want based on the exercises.,1492387200,4,355,3.9027777777777777

I sweat after every 25 minute workout even though I'm basically stretching and not doing cardio. I do one session each morning and I have more energy for the rest of day. Sometimes I have to watch a bit more to see how Miranda's doing the stretches - she doesn't go into great detail about the form - but she gives great advice about how to approach stretching and not doing anything to harm yourself, adjusting to fit your fitness level.",1487980800,,553,4.485148514851486

The Esmonde technique is the best way I found to build up my spine and core.  I personally prefer to exercise standing up so I do the standing programs only and I still get a lot of variety.  This isn't good if you are in acute pain.  But once you manage that part, do this to get your back and your entire body strong.  No weights or equipment needed.  A yoga mat is very helpful though.  All that being said, Classical Stretch is on PBS Monday through Friday.  I dvr those programs.  I have season 9 and 10.

5680286,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Mirandas workouts CHANGED MY LIFE. I feel different in my body than I ever have; it is now a proud integral part of me rather than a burden to drag around.

I am 54 years old, struggling with weight lifelong (currently 30 lbs overweight), a back-of-pack (slow) runner, once-a week yogini, with knee problems caused by several patellar dislocations and the strain of running. I also have one painful (undiagnosed) shoulder and occasionally my low back goes out.

I started doing Mirandas program on PBS, and after a year of starts and stops committed to doing it every day. After three months of daily (well, okay, sometimes 5-6 times a week) workouts, I know I need to do this for the rest of my life. I preferred PBSs Season 9 so decided to get this DVD set and cycle through the program every 30 days (yes, folks, thats 30 different workouts!).

Miranda, as an instructor, is not so great. She loses count, isn't consistent, is off-rhythm, kind of corny (which I actually like), and sometimes talks too much! However, I believe she is, and therefore her workouts are, GENIUS! You just have to figure out how to make the most of them; it will get better over time.

The main benefits, for me, are first: 1) mobility and 2) range of motion, followed by 3) strength and 4) flexibility. You will not get as strong as if you are lifting weights or as flexible as if you are doing yoga; however, this to me its the perfect combination. It has improved my base level of fitness in all areas. I cannot say this about anything I did in the past (and I have done many programs, gyms, etc).

Specifically, my hips are stronger and more mobile and flexible and therefore help to support my aching knees. My shoulder, although still painful, is mobile. My core (not my abs but my full trunk) is stronger and I sit and stand tall. My low back feels stronger and has not given out. Doing a Miranda workout after a run helps to ease the tightness and pain. It also has improved my yoga practice. Additionally, my toes and ankles are more supportive and mobile. Same with hands, fingers, forearms, etc. This workout proves that it is so much better to MOVE than to do nothing!

When I first saw the workouts, my head said old lady workouts. After doing the workouts a few times I was sore in places I didn't know existed! If I did it over again I would not be so enthusiastic about the stretching and pulling.

Dont worry if you cannot do everything. I believe the warmups in Season 9 are too fast so I do them at a slower pace. I stink at plies. I never listen when Miranda says pull, pull, pull. Do what you can, listen to your body, and improvement (along with a sense of pride in your body) will come. If you cant get on the floor or use a barre (chair) then do some of the standing-only workouts.

I decided to purchase this set so I could choose when I worked out instead of at the mercy of a specific time.  I am, I have to say, a little disappointed that the duplication of the video copying to the DVD is a little messy.  There are small little scratches/marks on the start of each DVD all the way around.  Maybe a few scattered here and there as well.  One video I can't play past the first few minutes; one half way through and it stops; some once played seem to correct themselves and there is no stop/rewind inside each video.  Playing all the videos through was my plan but for the price and the problems I am having...I am going to send it back for a better copy...I hope.

5680328,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I own Seasons 9 and 10 and will post this same review on both product pages. Classical Stretch has quickly become one of my faves. 1) I feel great and see results. 2) the exercises help alleviate my arthritis. 3), at 22-minutes per episode, I actually do a show almost every day, rather than just think about it. I've been a home exerciser for decades, but as I've aged I've had to adjust. I can't do high-impact anymore, jogging long ago gave way to walking, and arthritis affects even my yoga. My local PBS station airs CS and that's how I found it. Quickly became hooked (made my purchases from the CS website). I agree with other reviewers that the seasons increase in intensity. Season 9 is easier for me than Season 10. Most Season 9 episodes are half standing and half floor work. Season 10 is almost all standing routines. Also, as others have noted, Miranda occasionally moves too fast. I do the movements at my own pace. Ditto for the knee bends and leg lifts, which I do within my range of motion. Classical Stretch has joined Gilad (older shows) and Leslie Sansone as my go-to choices.",1451260800,4,1097,4.517587939698492

5680330,5,B00BX9ADE0,"These exercises are wonderful.  I do one 20 minute session every day.  There are a wide variety of exercises that make the daily routine fun.  I am over 70 and these exercises are great to keep limber and strengthen the whole body.  You can go to her website to see more details, but the prices here are reasonable for the shipping.  If you are considering one of Miranda's programs, this is a great Classical Stretch selection.  There is always a standing component which has you reaching and bending - but you can work at your own pace and to the extent your body will move.  I find that if I don't do them, my bad knee starts to hurt (it is FINE if I do the plies a few days a week)....my whole body stiffens up.  This is great for people who want NO impact.  In most of the sessions there is either a chair/barre component or a few floor exercises after the standing portion.  I use a yoga mat for the standing portion as I have tile floors.  I keep a sturdy padded folding chair handy for the barre exercises.  I can't do everything she does, but I do what I can and I feel great for doing it.",1450051200,25,1098,4.1761904761904765

5680333,5,B00BX9ADE0,"Because of a painful injury, I had let myself get out of shape.  I just couldn't figure out how to move that wouldn't create more injury.  I didn't want to take pain medication because that would mask the pain and further injury.  Then, when the pain came back I would be worse off than ever.  I paid for the entire Season 9 of Classical Stretch, could only do one of the twenty-odd workouts, and I still say that the price was worth it.  Fortunately Miranda talks during the workout, dropping clues about how to help yourself.  I started with advanced arthritis of the hips, plus intense pain in the knees.  I was on a cane and walker.  I had been a former dancer, so the loss of mobility was like dying.  At first the back and knee workout didn't seem to work except for immediately afterwards.  I had to change my walk or I was doomed.  After listening again to Miranda's comments, I practiced, even with the cane, stretching my back tall and flexing my knees while walking.  Maybe I was lucky, but for me the pain relief was almost immediate.  After three days I was off the cane.  The fourth day I was practicing some simple ballroom dance steps.  I fully expect to keep improving at this rate.  For me, this is the healthiest exercise there is, but the exerciser must figure out what to do the remaining 23 hours of the day to continue improving and not regress.  I should add that I eat an extremely high-nutrition diet, Joel Fuhrman's Eat to Live plan.  I do hope that this review is helpful to someone.",1447632000,140,1511,4.413043478260869

You can evolve with the workouts, making them harder for yourself as your body improves and strengthens. If you're having an ""off"" day and not feeling well, you can do the workout more gently, and it helps you feel better. Miranda's program is fun, effective, body-smart, and time-efficient. The workouts don't get boring, and they really work. The music is well-coordinated with the moves, and won't become an annoying ear worm for you. You will feel stronger in everything you do, have greater range of motion, and have more energy. I use this program every day and the DVDs last for years, so it's well worth the cost. Some reviewers have noted that in some workouts, Miranda gets a little off track talking and showing newbies what to do, but I simply do a few other moves until she's done, problem solved. Her personality comes across wonderfully (it's so endearing when she loses her balance or something and says ""Whoops!""). I feel like I know her after all these years working out with her guidance.

I have been doing the Classical stretching for 3 weeks now and am amazed at how much improvement I have had in my flexibility, energy level, and as a great bonus, my slacks are fitting better.  Miranda explains each exercise well and she is encouraging along the way, which I appreciate greatly.  I have recommended this set of videos to several of my friends.",1441152000,11,778,4.561151079136691
5680366,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I really like this series of exercise sessions. There are so many exercise sessions on the 4 cd's that I don't get bored and I like the location where the shot the video's and I like not having a whole class in the video. I only need to see the instructor. ;-)

If you put the effort into paying close attention to the instructor you can get a really good workout and I like that the sessions are short and I feel like doing them everyday.",1440547200,5,439,4.104651162790698
5680367,5,B00BX9ADE0,"I love her workouts.  I always want to do another one when I am done.  I have now done Miranda's workouts for almost a full year and when I began I was recovering from a fractured knee and rebuilding my body.  I am 61 years old now and these workouts have changed my life and my body.  My waist has lost inches and my abs and core are now very toned.  I ride horses and these DVDs (I own and do them all)  have made my legs super strong and my balance very good.  I have gotten rid of all of my weights as I don't need them anymore.  I love how Miranda explains everything so well and has such a great, sunny personality.  I think that she is adorable.  I highly recommend.  If you are not in shape, just do these at your own pace and you will improve rapidly.  I can't rave enough about this workout for mobility and to stay young.",1440460800,4,832,4.0060975609756095
5680368,5,B00BX9ADE0,"This product is packaged VERY poorly given the cost. I get free DVDs packaged better than this. I am just about to play the first disc, I will comment on the product content after a careful review BUT the quality of the over all physical product is extremely low grade. I am very disappointed!

I am back after using the product and prepared to leave my followup review. THIS IS AMAZING, the series offers 30 workouts, THAT IS A LOT!  The programming is quality and I really like Miranda. She knows what she is talking about and so do I. I am a fitness junkie since, well forever!

I was injured in a serious car accident and left to deal with chronic pain. I was unable to do what I once did and dealt with pain everyday after having tried everything. Thank GOD I was lying in bed in pain and turned on the TV to the Esmonde technique on PBS. I had to try it as I had tried everything else. IT WORKS, I feel amazing!  In fact these workouts make me feel good, they eliminate pain and all without hurting me EVER!  I am pleased to be getting back in shape. Some of her workouts are a bit more advanced than others and for that I am happy because I want to get back in shape. I love this work out series and not to worry there is enough for everyone of all levels and all the sessions can help anyone even the most fit or unfit. It is tender loving care for the human body.  WOW LOVE THIS SO MUCH!

IT is well worth every penny.

She does not have or use the proper terminology to give direction; she says things like ""move it all around"".  It made me laugh at first, but when I realized how much we paid for it I got upset.  Especially if you have ever had really good instructors, you know what I mean.  When I was done with the first episode my right side felt exercised and my left side felt normal. Really weird.  The exercises themselves are very good, but presentation and explanation is poor.  She is not very encouraging in fact she is down right egotistical.

Even the exercises for balance are very difficult and she even loses her balance at times.
The only good thing I can say is the settings are beautiful.  The music seemed too loud and didn't even fit in with the exercise.  I am sending this back and looking for a gentler type stretching.  For me, there
is too great a risk of getting hurt with this dvd.

i have failed  Scoliosis surgery  resulting loss of mobility 5 yrs. now ,  used walker though still youngish:)LOL

I was shocked when i got this home and see its tons of videos ...each devoted to whole body w focus on certain areas!

WOW.  BUT u move constantly  but slowly ,

No  strain,  I could do almost all  her  stretches ,  each  workout each is only 13 min!  IT is OVER SO FAST!

NOT USING ANY Equipment or Weights.. just stretching ,  it tones flabby arms , inner outer thighs/ hips.

ALL her stretching workouts begin w/  body warm up stretching,  then moves to  focus  on specific body area issues.

I LOVE that,  in case someone needs back help for pain, or core toning , thighs etc.

Elongates the spine , IF me with a Crooked Spine and Steel rods attached to it can do these  ANY ONE CAN.

ITS PEACEFUL,  Calming , RELAXING, NOT  like YOGA  and not Pilates .

 SHE Explains why and how the body and muscles work to control this body function or that one etc.
There are workouts SPECIALLY for  BACK PAIN< HIP PAIN< Shoulder Pain rotary cuff pain etc...

I haven't done all workouts because each DVD comes with has so many on 1 disc!

And there are 6 disc I think.  BUT i am LOVING  this,  it helps with my sever insomnia too.
those with
ALL AGES  can USE THIS,  from teens Seniors  THERE TRULY are stretches for peopelk that haven't moved in 20 yrs or more , so  no matter what  ur ability or lack of ability is.

I am grateful , because my strength is returning and flexibility, tone, the tightness of  hip joints is better,  my mobility in getting around is increased.

My hips are fused form my shoulders to my hips, so pelvis is constricted and this helps alot.

Muscle tone and reverse of muscle Atrophy can happen at any age if we move around.

 I realized after sitting in house immobile  5 yrs.,  that not moving,  perpetuates more immobility.

 I took the initiative and got  this , so  I can get my life back.

Regain strength,  release pain, gain  flexibility , restore  posture

Oh!  If your 5ft. 5 inches or Shorter , and want to be taller...with age our spines decompress,  its why all humans lose height!

These stretches elongate the spine, limbs,  in time restores proper muscle tone to regain proper posture

Lets spine decompress naturally .

My hips, legs, lower and upper back are more stress free and mobile:). I have to chuckle when she puts her head on her shins. I don't believe I will every see the day when I can do it, but I can be more flexible being just me. My pain has greatly decreased, and my energy level has increased.

I will never go a day without stretching with this lady again.

UPDATE: I've been doing Classical Stretch daily for a total of five months. I'm so much more muscular now, and I feel so good that I just want to run and play like a kid. It's summer, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my stamina and flexibility. My butt isn't chunky anymore. My arms don't jiggle. I would recommend this program to everyone and anyone.

Update 2: It's been years now. I recently had my second child, and I'm slowly working back up to strength. I continued doing most of these exercises (aside from the ab-focused ones) for most of my pregnancy. I think that helped with labor, delivery, and recovery with a ten pound baby.

1) i thought there was very little pre-instruction
2) it went so fast that I couldn't keep up with learning it and staying aligned
3) I found it hurt my hips and lower back probably due to above.

If you like Bar Method and Barre 3, this is a great deal.  If you need something more basic, I would start with something else (which i haven't found yet).

later:  I returned the DVD container with the 4 new DVDs inside.  All i did was open the shrink wrap, and play 2 segments of one video, and felt it was too fast for me and i would injure myself.  I was totally shocked that out of $65 price they refunded me $35. The seller is Absolute Yogi, they said they needed to charge this much as it was now a used item.  We called Amazon, and said it would involve putting on new shrink wrap on perfect DVDs.  Amazon refunded me in full.
