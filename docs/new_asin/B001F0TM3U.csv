8300431,3,B001F0TM3U,"The story centers on three girls who were friends since childhood. Dana (Lydia Leonard) has been in the Poe mental health clinic for the last 12 years. She claims that her and her two friends while playing a parlor game, ""True True, Lie"" killed a boy Nicky and buried him under the floor boards.

They say she is delusional and Nicky is alive, something I am sure would have investigated at the time...Hey is a boy missing or not? They created a plot hole you could drive a truck through and didn't think anyone would notice.

Anyway, Dana is getting better and is released. She is staying with her friends Paige (Annabelle Wallis) and is constantly challenged by Nathalie (Jamie King).

The film is an erotic thriller with Jamie King being a significant tease in the film. The film isn't any better than the ""truth or dare"" type of films out there and should appeal to those who can't get enough of that genre. Other than the plot holes, the acting and script was acceptable, but nothing to get excited over. Better than most of the modern Redbox lower tier offerings.

8300433,2,B001F0TM3U,"Comes another mess filmed in Romania trying to look like Connecticut. I was hoping for something unique as Jamie King has been a local favorite since she came through here years ago right after filming this movie (for The Tripper). The Weinstein circus held onto this a few years and released this as a bare bones DVD.

This strange story centers on three ladies who have been friends since childhood. The opening sequence shows this adult triumvirate seducing three unsuspecting men into their doom, followed by flashbacks of something tragic and similar in nature happening during their adolescence. The oft confused and convoluted story continues with a spattering of psychosis, lunacy and almost more screen time of the young actors over the present day adult actresses.

Laundry list: The fact they filmed in Romania pops up more times than the Connecticut license plates (obvious European ambulance and other vehicles), this whole ominous voice that fills one character's head is never materialized, the continual (and pointless to the story) long shots of nature elements to an Enya style score, all add up to a frustrating time spent watching Jamie King overplay her psycho role in hopes of giving the film a dark who-is-the-real-cuckoo feel.

The film quality looks good, the sound is a decent 5.1, there are no supplements and there are one or two decent songs. Not horrible but not good either as the performances and story cancel each other out in getting a higher rating.",1248480000,5,1484,5.024390243902439
