6132270,5,B00H4RFMVY,"While this set does not contain as much viewing time as the first volume (this set has 240 minutes and the first volume had 640), it is still a worthwhile purchase and I am pleased with it. I like the authors represented and the works chosen. If you are a fan of English costume dramas, you will enjoy this.",1396915200,24,307,4.220338983050848
6132271,5,B00H4RFMVY,I have one video to finish all of the shows.  They have all been fine quality if not alittle disturbing to watch.  The packaging of the videos is outstanding.  I have  enjoyed all the extras that were contained in the package.  A great value to explore.,1394668800,9,253,4.413043478260869
6132272,1,B00H4RFMVY,"There are 4 Masterpiece Theatre/BBC productions in here that are worth watching.  If it had been explained what this ""Classic English Literature Collection"" contained, I would have realized I had already seen 2 of these productions on PBS.  This is in a very fancy box with a content that's way too limited for the price.  The clarity of this product is missing in the marketing.",1394409600,7,379,4.8

6132275,4,B00H4RFMVY,"I enjoyed the movies, which were good quality filming, but the  only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5, was because I need to have captioning and many of these  packaged BBC movie sets are NOT captioned.  It is hard enough to understand the English accent,  but not be able to follow better with captioning,  has made my viewing less desirable.",1431302400,36,342,4.451612903225806

8629990,4,B00H4RFMVY,"The stories are good and well acted, but since i am older I wish they had subtitle as sometimes it is hard to hear the dialog.",1522281600,,126,3.8846153846153846

8629992,3,B00H4RFMVY,"I was a bit disappointed in this set of classic videos.  Assuming that because it came from PBS it would be great programming was probably my first mistake.  (Usually PBS, BBC, and Masterpiece Theatre do really put forth good versions of classic movies).  I watched the entirety ""The Turn of the Screw"" - what an odd story!  The acting was well done, if a bit overly dramatic and quirky, but I didn't care for the ending.  I started one of the other ones (""A Room With a View"" and wasn't able to get far into it without choosing something else to watch -  a bit slow for my taste.
Maybe when I have some time to ""kill"" (i.e. waste!) I'll try again.",1515542400,,648,4.270491803278689

8629995,3,B00H4RFMVY,"The dvd's are great, good quality, etc. but there is no ""Closed Caption"" for any of the DVD's.  That is not good for me, now I need to find my favorite movies in the Set with closed caption.  Will pass these on - too late to get my money back from Amazon.",1473552000,5,255,3.8846153846153846
