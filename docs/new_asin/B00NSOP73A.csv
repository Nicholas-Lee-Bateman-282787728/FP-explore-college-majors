6677974,4,B00NSOP73A,"I love this movie!  It's a little corny but it is very well done and give us a little glimpse, albeit a dramatized one, into Jane Austen's life.  Anne Hathaway portrays Jane's intensity and drive very well, and James McAvoy as her love interest brings just the right amount of charm to the part.  From the reading I have done on Jane's life, the movie follows it somewhat faithfully expanding certain areas for dramatic effect.  If you're looking for a light, enjoyable movie, and you're a Jane Austen fan, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1427760000,12,539,4.6421052631578945

6677985,4,B00NSOP73A,"(Matthew's wife here) I LOVE Jane Austen so much that I usually don't like modern fictionalized stories about her.  Anne Hathaway's Jane was  I think a bit too immature and brash for Jane, and the rest fo the supporting cast and the characters they played were only adequate...

The love story wasn't particularly true to Jane's existing letters and is so completely unfounded that it's silly. However, James McAvoy is really fantastic.  I can't help but feel that even the real Jane Austen would find his character Tom to be shocking, reprehensible--and irresistibly charming.",1483833600,,577,5.1063829787234045

6678005,5,B00NSOP73A,"A beguiling speculation on a brief period in Jane Austen's life, Becoming Jane is so well conceived, written and realized that it fits in seamlessly among film and TV mini-series adaptations of her own work. Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy are perfectly cast as Austen and her love interest, Tom Lefroy. Their onscreen chemistry is both palpable and appealing, and the two deliver fine performances, particularly the fetching Mr McAvoy, who is an ideal Austen romantic hero. He could've easily portrayed the quintessential Mr. Darcy, Captain Wentworth and/or Edward Ferrars.

A wonderfully romantic and charming imagining of what might have been.",1454457600,5,645,5.3861386138613865

6678017,3,B00NSOP73A,"If you are a Jane Austen fan you will already know this, but there is quite a cottage industry around her these days. By this I don't just mean that her books get made into movies or TV series every ten years or so, but authors are also busy out there producing sequels to her books, or alternate versions, or otherwise expanding on her works.  This movie is another product of that industry.  It seems we just can't get enough of Austen. (For good reason - she is that good and she left us so little of herself.)

The people who made this movie aren't pretending it is an accurate portrayal of her life as a young Jane falling in love and embarking on her writing career - in the description it is called a ""cinematic imagining"" of her life.  It is clever in its own way as it suggests that elements from her book Pride and Prejudice were drawn from this early romantic experience. So if the plot seems vaguely familiar to you fans, that is no accident.

I found the movie entertaining enough. I was irritated at first that Jane would fall for this guy, but again, look at Pride and Prejudice.  The sharp wit and intelligence that Austen displays in her books is on display here in Jane, so that is as it should be.  I like her family and how they interact: even her mother becomes a more rounded character during the course of the movie after a harsh beginning.

I have read a lot of snarky or dismissive one-star reviews of ""Becoming Jane"" on this site, and believe me, if you want a list of one-star movies I can provide it, and they will all be much, much worse than this film.  It's real sin rests on not being accurate, which is the lamentable fate of any story of Austen's life because we know so little. Just relax and enjoy it for what it is: a half-decent entry in the ongoing Austen cottage industry.  (For a wonderful and imaginative example of this, see also Lost in Austen.)",1438041600,10,1889,4.340909090909091
6678018,4,B00NSOP73A,"Story is not true to Austen's life, judging from the biographies I've read...much is added for dramatic effect in the relationship between Austin and LeFroy. That said, if it WERE accurate, it would no doubt be far less entertaining.  :)  The characters are believable, the story line (although enhanced) is compelling, and McAvoy and Hathaway have great chemistry onscreen. I watch it at least once a year, as a die hard romantic, but if you are a stickler for historical accuracy, you may have less appreciation for this film.",1437955200,4,528,4.921348314606742
6678019,5,B00NSOP73A,"""Becoming Jane"" is my favorite of all the Jane Austen film presentations; it has the most depth- and- with the commentary that accompanies- shows the deepest understanding of what made Austen tick.
The mention of Jane in Auden's ""Letter to Byron""- her understanding of class...
The indispensablilty of money- as Jane's mother says= I would like to see an appearance by Karl Marx in this delightful movie- but whether he does or not- this movie reaches unusual depth.",1437609600,3,466,4.987179487179487
6678020,5,B00NSOP73A,Becoming Jane with Directors commentary is unequaled. So many actors gifts are revealed by the directors. It makes for a richer experience after hearing those additions.,1437523200,,169,5.538461538461538
6678021,5,B00NSOP73A,"So, I loved this movie. I know there are some nay-sayers to Hathaway being the leading lady, but I thought she was able to deliver a subtle, thoughtful (not super sexed up) portrayal of Austen. Her and McAvoy still had great chemistry: It was sweet, youthful, and multiple.

To confess: I wasn't really a fan of Austen's work until I watched this movie. I had read a few of her books lackadaisically, but never FELT the appeal. This movie delivered that component for me. Before ""Becoming Jane"" I always felt her stories and the people who read them religiously were a bit of nostalgic romanticized nuts... however; this movie allowed me to feel those timeless narratives of heartbreak, desire, fear, wonder, and anticipation. After watching the film, I gave her novels another go and her words read a bit differently. So... I appreciate the film, its actor/actresses and the crew for assisting me in helping me understand Austen's stories and the people who love them, differently.",1436659200,12,982,4.9156626506024095

8679910,4,B00NSOP73A,"I loathe everything Austen but condescended to watch this because I love James McAvoy. And indeed he does a supremely excellent job (as always) portraying Tom Lefroy, the love of Austen's life. This movie would've been 1-star if not for him. A very fascinating story based on historical facts, with some very, very good lines by Tom (a wowza library scene again), but Anne Hathaway is as dull as dishwater, who relies more on her looks than acting ability. Unable to match McAvoy in intensity, Hathaway prances around flipping her locks and reciting lines like she is reading Shakespeare. There is zero chemistry among the leads, although McAvoy holds up his end supremely well. Another sizzling performance from McAvoy. By the end of the story, movie, you will have fallen in love with him and cry for Tom Lefroy. Worth watching for: The story and James McAvoy.",1512777600,,862,4.870748299319728

8679912,3,B00NSOP73A,"This is a adequately enjoyable movie.  As a Jane Austen fan, I think its always fun to imagine the author herself, especially since she was such a private person. I have no idea of the accuracy of this story, but I found it an interesting topic. Given that, I really wanted to love this movie. What tainted it for me and why I only gave it 3 stars, is Anne Hathaways stiff and unemotional portrayal of Jane.  Man, she just looks like you wouldnt be able to snap her in two even with a sledge hammer; shes that rigid.  I'm not sure why Anne felt the need to portray Jane this way, unless she just really didn't want to do this movie in the first place.  James McAvoy does his best to act around her, and he does a great job as Mr. Lefroy.  However, because of Annes horrific acting, theres minimal chemistry detected between the characters.  Again, the storyline is fascinating, but Anne Hathaways acting (or lack of) ruined this film for me.",1507334400,,941,4.379310344827586
