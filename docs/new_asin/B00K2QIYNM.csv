6401667,5,B00K2QIYNM,My son Jared got this video for and I enjoy walking and riding to it. Love the birds singing. Change in scenery done well and holds my interest. I have 3 videos and they keep me moving.,1419897600,,185,4.027027027027027
6401668,5,B00K2QIYNM,"This is a great cycling DVD through the south of France. Tres bon! The pace is perfect, and not like the motorcycle pace you sometimes see in bicycling DVDs. You have a choice of three wonderful rides, or you can let them loop continuously for a longer workout. In the countryside, there is very little traffic, so you feel alone and free. Gradual climbs through hilly tree-lined scenery suddenly give way to breathtaking, Grand Canyon-like cliffs and valleys. I didn't know France had such dynamic geology! You then peddle into more pastures and orchards, listening to church bells ringing in the air. This is not an urban video; even when you are peddling through towns, there is an abiding relationship with nature. In fact, you will see entire white-stoned villages built into ancient stone cliffs, like birds nests. A medieval castle suddenly looms into view. This is a unique and rare trip into the heart of the French countryside, offering a variety of work-out options, like pleasant grades, gradual climbs, and hair raising cliffs. But don't worry, theres a guard rail. Fantastic workout! Interesting and exhilarating. Kudos once again to the folks at Ambient.",1414108800,5,1169,5.030927835051546

6401670,5,B00K2QIYNM,"Very nice indoor cycling DVD!  In particular, I loved Walk 2 and 3.  South of France country roads, old towns, hills, autumn leaves, all lovely.  Very enjoyable for cycling (and I guess also for walking on a treadmill). Nature sounds. I play my own music whilst using this DVD.",1409788800,2,277,4.612244897959184

8655447,5,B00K2QIYNM,"I bought an exercise bike earlier this year and there are times where I'll cycle while listening to music or while watching tv but I found that I would get so distracted if I was watching a show. My speed would slow down because I was so engrossed in whatever I was watching which completely defeats the purpose. I decided to give this a try so that I would be better focused and I chose the south of France because it's where my very best friend lives and it's absolutely beautiful country. Just yesterday, I biked for an entire hour alternating at a medium to high speed. The speed at which the video goes is a constant moderate speed but personally, I think it's perfect. I would rather choose to go much faster and during the times that I did, it didn't feel any different. I had far more drive and focus to finish my hour of biking and I did. I love the natural sounds of the birds and a car passing every now and again. There's even people walking on the sides. It really makes it feel as if you're enjoying a bike ride in the countryside. The views are beautiful, the only con I think of the whole video is on the turns, the picture becomes a bit fuzzy until you straighten out again. It makes you a little dizzy for a brief moment but it's not bad at all. All in all, I really enjoy this dvd and I do plan on purchasing more like it. Bon Voyage!",1447027200,2,1353,4.1679389312977095
8655448,2,B00K2QIYNM,"The preview featured a beautiful mountain village, & I thought at least part of the DVD would include a ride there but it didn't. Even though there are 3 different rides the vast majority of the footage is all the same, roads and rocky mountains. Anytime something new would appear the scene would sort of 'fold' away to the next boring stretch of road.",1437523200,2,353,4.53125
8655449,5,B00K2QIYNM,"These Virtual Cycle Ride DVDs really keep my exercise routine from being mundane.  I own several of them.  Therefore, I can rotate them on a daily basis with three rides on each DVD, it gives you lots of variety.

I had bi-lateral knee replacement about six months ago and must do an exercise routine daily.  However, I find that these DVDs are really helping me during these exercise routines as well as on they do when I use the stationary bike or treadmill.  By using these great DVDs you don't focus so much on the exercise as you do on the scenery...makes my workout go faster.

This DVD is high quality HD with brilliant, clear images and great nature sounds.  I enjoy the ever changing scenery on each of the three rides.  I especially enjoy looking at the history town.

I hope you will continue to add to this library of exercise videos as they help to make exercising more enjoyable and interesting.  I love to travel and see new places. Now I can without even interrupting my exercise program...",1434585600,,1006,4.538888888888889
8655450,3,B00K2QIYNM,"Great scenery, but the speed never varies. Wish it would, then this would have been a 5 star rating",1429315200,,99,4.2631578947368425
8655451,3,B00K2QIYNM,"This is a very peaceful video, I definitely will give it that. The pace of the first track was perfect for me....enough for me to get some ""wind in my hair"" but not paced for an automobile. The second two tours were slower, and I could see using a treadmill for them, but I didn't enjoy it on my Spin bike.
Personally, I much enjoy my Spinning Ireland DVD, instead.",1428796800,,365,4.228571428571429
8655452,5,B00K2QIYNM,"Since I've never been in the South of France, I bought this DVD a few days ago and I must say I am very excited. It is ideal for a workout on the exercise machine. It is eagerly rushing along small roads, you pass cliffs, drive partly through fields and through beautiful villages. You can rapidly pedal or drive a little more comfortable past houses and olive trees. The DVD gives you a real feeling of vacation, you feel as if you ride on your bicycle there. Above all, the beautiful colors of these routes and the natural background noise have inspired me again. This DVD is also good for a longer workout because you can also relax in between by a slower travel speed.",1428364800,,672,4.384
