8760901,2,B01FJFHONG,"I thought this video would be a collection of various birds feeding at various different feeders and baths but instead you get a fixed camera image of the same bird bath with a few of the same birds visiting.  No zooming in, no different angles, nothing.  The feeder is the same as well.  And, sometimes you don't even see the bird if it perches on top of the feeder, you just see its feet....awesome viewing for my patients.  I have other videos from this company and I like them...this one will be returned.  It was also damaged in transit.  A piece of plastic broke off inside the case, rattled around and scratched the disc.  It still played, however, the lack of interesting content was the deal-breaker.",1494288000,5,709,4.579365079365079
8760902,5,B01FJFHONG,"You will really enjoy the birdbath.
As in the description. it has two scenes. The birdbath has a wonderful variety of birds (they are quite exotic and yet somehow familiar) and chirping, the feeder not so much. But a nice vid none the less.
The feeder needs more birds but is till nice, sorta like watching out your window, NICE SOUNDS ALSO, WORTH ADDING TO A COLLECTION.",1489795200,2,371,4.552238805970149

8760904,5,B01FJFHONG,"Oh, I just love this! Very relaxing and I play it for my parrots as well!!!",1486512000,,75,3.75
8760905,5,B01FJFHONG,"There are two scenes available on this DVD: one is a bird feeder, which has a good variety of birds and pretty high activity; the other is a bird bath that is also quite active.  BOth have a good variety of birds, and both are available with either natural sound or with music.  The definition is great; especially with the nature sounds, it's like turning your TV into a window on nature.  Definitely a good buy.",1479513600,3,413,4.407894736842105
8760906,5,B01FJFHONG,"I purchased this DVD for my little parakeet to watch on a portable DVD player.  She is an only bird, so I have played various ""bird DVD's"" for her to keep her company - they have mostly been documentary-style DVD's.  But this nature DVD is of lovely birds feeding and playing and singing, without any any human narrative, so not only does my parakeet enjoy having this to keep her company - I also enjoy the sounds of birds singing as background noise while I am working on my computer.",1475971200,6,486,4.388888888888889
8760907,5,B01FJFHONG,"With this DVD you can relax wonderfully. Here you can look at birds very closely. I liked the bird bath best, where you can observe many different birds as they take a bath or drink. The matching sounds of the singing birds give you a highly realistic experience. I also found the squirrel in the feeder very cute, it is beautiful how you can see this spectacle of nature up close.",1466208000,2,381,4.380281690140845
8760908,5,B01FJFHONG,"Two scenes of brilliant colorful birds.  One scene is a decorative concrete feeder and bird bath visited by several tropical birds enjoying a dip or getting a drink of cool refreshing water.  The other scene takes place in a lovely green forest where the feeder is a quaint, miniature cottage decorated with lovely pink flowers.  Stopping at this feeder are several hungry birds and a scampering squirrel, which was an unexpected surprise.  This is a must for bird lovers.  I especially enjoyed the melodious songs of the different birds as they enjoyed a free snack.",1464220800,2,567,4.926315789473684
