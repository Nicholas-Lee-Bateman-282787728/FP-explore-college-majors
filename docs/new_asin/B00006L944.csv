7971316,5,B00006L944,"For a weary soul looking for water in the desert, these 3 ""Songs 4 Worship"" DVDs are the answer.  They will carry you back to a time when we could lose ourselves in the presence of God and you will experience again at home what you once had to travel elsewhere to find.  Each contains about an hour and 20 minutes of live performances by Don Moen, Paul Wilbur, Darlene Zschech, Alvin Slaughter, Benny Hinn, Women of Faith, Twila Paris and Ron Kenoly.",1289520000,3,450,4.409638554216867
