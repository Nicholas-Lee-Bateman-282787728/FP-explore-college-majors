7664565,3,B01BO5RTZI,"Where's MST3K when you need it? This low budget film took forever to get going and, once it did, they recycled the exact same fighting-off-the-giant-spiders scenes over and over.

Many of the voices used for dubbing this Italian horror film reminded me of a very angry and gruff Popeye before his first morning cup of coffee.

I expected the SFX to be cheesy and they were. Some of the explosions were on par with a middle school science project gone bad. The ridiculous highlight of Arachnicide had to be the ""Thermovision"" that represented what was happening on screen with the same authenticity of an Atari arcade game from the early 80s.",1472256000,3,641,4.7657657657657655
7664566,3,B01BO5RTZI,"I was going to say I hated it and give it one star. The lip-synching is understandable: regardez the original ""GOJIRA"" vs ""GODZILLA STARRING RAYMOND BURR"", but honestly, people who made this ... I thought the actors that voiced the 1930s cartoon characters Bluto and Olive Oyl were long since dead, congratulations on finding them! (I'm sorry to sense the character actor who voiced Popeye must surely have died, otherwise you'd've hired him, too.) I don't know where the rest of the voice 'talent' came from, but I hope they've all graduated or gotten their GEDs and moved on to lucrative careers in the food service or housekeeping industries. Okay. I could move on to other odd shortcomings (video-game-quality animation, special effects, and compositing) and really wanted to rate it ""less than one"", but having read the previous three comments, I gave it another chance and decided on three stars because:

1. It's an indie Euro low-budget horror film with pretty high live-action production values and modestly impressive in-camera practical SPFX. These are difficult and expensive to produce competently, and there are scenes which (upon review) are actually pretty excellently put in the can. (POINT OF COMPARISON, perhaps? They do low-budget indie -- we do low budget indie. They give us ""Arachnicide"" -- we give them ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"") --OKAY, unfair, ""Plan 9"" was ""ZERO-budget"" and clueless, but by comparison, this was ""Gone With The Wind""! That's a 3.

2. Everyone seemed to be trying to actually do a good job. The 16-bit animation and compositing was primitive and distracting and laughable ... BY TODAY'S STANDARDS, which have become remarkably and impossibly high with masterful SPFX ""classics"" like the Transformer s***, where the only purpose of the film is to show off how good CGI is becoming and people, stories, character development, logic? purpose? all take a back seat. Frankly, I've seen a lot of expensive Hollyweird blockbuster wannabees (let me see, the Tom Cruise ""War Of The Worlds"" or the John Revolta ""Battlefield Scientology"" fiasco [hmm, both Scientology-funded... but two turds doth not necessarily make an epidemic of dysentery...] come to mind, off the toppa mah hed.) S***, I give it three stars alone for not bowing to any corporate master I can discern, be it Coke or Pepsi or my previous occasional employer, L. Ron Hubbard and the Writers/Illustrators of the Future contests (WHICH, make no mistake, are DOING GOOD DEEDS ... but for all the wrong reasons.)

3. As difficult as it is to keep my 'head in the game"" (it's really easy to lose the suspension of disbelief here because the cartoon voices are terribly distracting and the cgi is - as I mentioned - well, actually, it's 8-bit, ""Super Mario"" animations and explosions and all, but it's 16-bit compositing which somehow never *quite* gets its act together that brings (a) sometimes excellent live action plates with (b) really awful particle-system flame and smoke disguises layered over (c) obnoxiously amateurish cgi spiders), I have to admit, it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, such as was ""Plan Nine"" ... or any number of American big-studio wastes-of-cellulose.

I ended up like everyone else here: I sorta appreciate everyone's effort and they meant well. But I can't actively dislike it, I know how difficult it is to make ANY movie and for an indie, these guys (unisex, guys & gals!) did a pretty respectable job of making a popcorn seller! No, it's not a Schwarzenegger budget and they did very well with what they had.

But if you haven't seen any number of other giant spider invasion* films, some of which are amusingly visited by the crew at ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", this may be the film for you! Wow: Giant Spiders! What a country! Mr. Waverly, I hope you took that ring off before you got dosed! (bet NOBODY gets that easter egg!)

*I think one was actually called ""The Giant Spider Invasion"" and starred famous people from ""Gilligan's Island"", ""Star Trek"" and ""Perry Mason"".

But, ""Did I like it?"" ... mmm, no, I didn't like it enough to recommend it (or even probably remember it, other than the name) but with all its obstacles, I have to say it didn't earn a ""Didn't Like It"" 2-Star rating. I didn't like it. But I saw the effort that went into it and as such can't totally hate it.

So I find myself giving it a 3-Star because I feel sorry for it. I didn't hate it even enough to want my money or minutes back for having watched it, but I also didn't enjoy it enough I'd have felt satisfied if I paid for a theater seat to watch it. It's a clever indie, folks, an independent low-budget skiffy flick not made in USA with USA $$ and USA sensibilities. Take it for what it is: a kid with a camera makes a pretty gorram cool self-indulgent science fiction fantasy film with friends, and friends-of-friends, and UNLIKE A S***LOAD OF AMERICAN FILM CORPORATIONS' EFFORTS, this one is watchable, almost likeable, and unfettered by ABC/DISNEY, CBS/PARAMOUNT, any number of other Citizens-United beneficiaries' demands and restrictions.

It may not be a perfect film, but it's independent and low-budget and with those thoughts in mind, eminently watchable.

But yeah, that being said ... ""It's Okay. 3 Stars, in a technical decision by the Judge. It isn't great, but it doesn't suck. And has some excellent practical special effects, executed with an aplomb seldom seen in low-budget indie cinema. I wish I understood Italian and could experience the film as intended, without the cartoon parody voices.""",1471910400,2,5555,4.887473460721869
7664567,3,B01BO5RTZI,"""Spiders"" is the UK title for ""Arachnicide"". A group of soldiers operating around the world using sophisticated drone and spy satellites are taking  cocaine growing locations. These locations are using seeds soaked in ""Solution 500"" which accelerates growth. In order to fight back, the drug dealers set a trap using the solution on Atrax robustus, an aggressive venomous spider found near Sydney. The last 40 minutes of the film consists of the troops firing automatic weapons at a cluster of spiders with the occasional death.

The film started out fine until one of the ""actors"" spoke and you realized the film is horribly dubbed. Mildly campy with some attempts at cute and clever dialogue that falls short of great entertainment.

8750879,2,B01BO5RTZI,"There's not much sci fi in here or horror until more than half the film is on the floor. This is primarily a military action film, with CGI spiders thrown in at the end (cheaply) which is a shame because imho they did a decent job of setting up the cause of the giant spider infestation. But they dropped the ball and made a very boring (unless you like watching military action flicks) chunk of cinematography. Soldiers are straight from the cliche bin. This might appeal to die-hard scifi and horror fans but I felt there just wasn't much here. Two stars basically for the effort and the heavy lifting needed to get their production complete, but may one star would be more appropriate.",1497139200,,688,4.556451612903226
8750880,1,B01BO5RTZI,"I will watch & LOVE anything Nature Gone Wild, but this was not a movie about spiders. This was some sort of military movie, with the first 44 minutes of planning the ""operation"". At 48 minutes we get our first spider, & I was so ready for everyone to die. Beyond horrible acting! I didn't bother watching to the end, but I finally made it end for me. And this had a three star rating?!?!? Oh well, got to get a bad one sometime!",1491523200,,429,4.119047619047619

8750882,3,B01BO5RTZI,"Spoiler Alert.
A stinker, but fun. Animation was OK, acting was OK, plot was dreadful, but it had giant spiders which made it better. The battle between the soldiers and the Spiders was too long and they kept using the same scenes of dying Spiders, over and over and over and over. There were a few intentionally funny parts and quite a few not intentional funny parts. The rescue was one of those. The colonel in the helicopter kept flying around in near dusk skies with no back up. Him and a pilot I think. He had no plan and luckily he spotted the team just before the Spiders overtook them. Like I said, not good, but giant spiders made it better.",1475452800,,651,4.344262295081967
