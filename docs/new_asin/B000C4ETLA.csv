8163800,5,B000C4ETLA,"Blancmange is one the great electronic bands of the 1980's ""new wave"" movement. Besides partners Neil Arthur (vocals, guitar) and Stephen Luscombe (keyboards), they employed the talents of David Rhodes, the inventive guitar player better known for his work with Peter Gabriel.  Their debut recording, Happy Families, is a masterwork of synth-pop while sporting more advanced and varied compositions than many of their peers.  Their second release, Mange Tout in 1984, included the hit single ""Blind Vision"" and charted at #8 that year.  This DVD contains a performance from the Mange Tout tour, at the Hammersmith Palais in May 1984.  The set list is split evenly between their first and second albums. Highlights include a raucous version of ""Living on the Ceiling"" along with ""That's Love That It Is"".  Also Neil delivers resonant vocals on ""Waves"" - a key track that shows that Blancmange had more to offer beyond dance music.  The sound is excellent as is the picture quality.  Minimal inserts of music video footage and graphics treatments add, rather than detract, from the live footage, which varies effectively between close-up and medium shots of Neil on vocals, Stephen on keys, and the rest of the band.  Percussionist Pandit Dinesh adds rich accents to the mix, and backing vocalists Ruby James & Lorenza Johnson sound terrific, livening things up with their clear harmonies, dance moves, and fun wardrobe. Only gripe is that guitarist David Rhodes is left out of view and deserves better given his stature and key contribution to the band.  Also, the DVD extras do not add to the content. Despite that, this is an excellent DVD and is recommended to any fan of '80s new wave, electronic and dance music.  Note: this release is far superior to ""Live at the Hacienda"" which will only be useful to dedicated fans and completists.
