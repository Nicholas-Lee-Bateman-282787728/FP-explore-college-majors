8144547,1,B000I8OOPG,"Too weird. Mega dysfunction, unendingly dreary scenery, seemed staged and repetitive. I like Scandinavian understated dramas with dark themes, but after a while the characters unending self-absorption was wearying.  I felt they could all use an emotional high colonic, stop whining and do some meaningful work like breaking rocks and cleaning hen-houses.
Do not recommend, and if you have winter blues I suggest you stay well away from this.",1418515200,,441,5.391304347826087

8144551,4,B000I8OOPG,"German Director Oskar Roehler's ""Agnes and His Brothers"" raises a family's dysfunctionality to an art form. It is all about a father, who may have molested one of them-- and his three sons. Agnes (Martin Weiss) is a transgendered dancer in an abusive relationship; Werner (Herbert Knaup is a member of parliament-- obsessed with his own bodily functions-- whose wife has fallen out of love with him and whose son ridicules him openly; and Hans-Jorg (Moritz Bleibtreu) calls himself a sex addict. He gets off watching through a peephole in a restroom young women relieving themselves not unlike a nonfiction senator from Idaho recently caught in a men's room-- Hans gets caught as well-- except this is the heterosexual version of events. These three siblings are weird in their own unique ways. The film is laced through and through with humor, not the least of which are the scenes when Hans attends meetings for sex addicts.

Although the events do not always work, the director's statement about the significance of families, even with all their fault lines is well worth watching. In their own strange way-- and strange it is-- these brothers care about each other.",1208304000,8,1169,4.964285714285714
