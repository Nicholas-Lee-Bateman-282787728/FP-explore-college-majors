5665298,5,B00BQ412GU,"Since I like musicals, I can say that I enjoyed each one f these.

One of my favorites, and perhaps my best, is An American in Paris. An American G.I. who loves to paint lives in Paris seeking inspiration, and he finds the woman he loves in a young French girl, Lisa Bouvier, played by Leslie Caron. This film tops the others for its varied numbers with music by George Gershwin, awesome tap-dancing numbers by Gene Kelly, Oscar Levant's piano playing, and George Guetary's singing. This film also has an extended An American in Paris ballet sequence that is alive with a dynamic choreography accompanied by lush and brilliant colors in the scenography and costuming. This sequence is only rivaled by the Broadway Melody Ballet in Singin' in the Rain (1952) and the Red Shoes Ballet in the film with that same name (1948).

Anchors Aweigh is a light romantic comedy where Kelly pairs with Frank Sinatra. Although not as exceptional as An American in Paris, it is delightful to see the beautiful Kathryn Greyson singing; Kelly tap-dancing with Jerry from Tom 'n' Jerry cartoons, and Jose Iturbe's piano playing. The Kelly and Jerry sequence and the presence of Orley Lindgren, a child actor, suggest that this is a family-oriented film.

On The Town is an excellent light romantic musical comedy about three sailors and three women in New York. It is an adaptation from a Broadway play and it is a dynamic musical film. Probably, it is the second best in this group. And I think that people who love musicals will enjoy this one, but also comedy fans can get a laugh out of this one. The cross-dressing at the end reminded me of Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot done many years later. Undoubtedly, this was a great combination of comedy and musical.

Finally, Brigadoon is a musical mixed with fantasy where Kelly discovers a world that doesn't appear on a map. Just think of Lost Horizons in a musical way, and without the philosophy behind that movie, and you got Brigadoon: a colorful, happy community that sings and dances and lives a ""just be merry"" kind of life. Although not on a top musical list, it is entertaining. Cyd Charisse accompanies Kelly in this film.

All in all, this was a good set of musicals for me.",1404432000,61,2220,4.667519181585678
5665299,5,B00BQ412GU,"Gene Kelly never failed to entertain.  He could sing, dance and act.  When paired with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron and others, an art form was created which has never been duplicated. He was amazing!!",1397088000,8,213,4.72972972972973

5665302,4,B00BQ412GU,"These are a great deal for the money. A few negatives....The discs come stacked on top of each other in the case. There's a subtle and constant hissing sound which I got used to like white noise (I'm guessing they're not remastered). Some movies are widescreen (Brigadoon) and some are fullscreen (American in Paris).  I haven't watched the others yet. All this isn't ideal but the movies are still totally enjoyable, and at ten bucks for four movies it's a great way to build your movie collection.",1487462400,,499,4.735632183908046

5665317,4,B00BQ412GU,"An American in Paris is one of my favorite musicals. The other movies are fun to watch because Gene Kelly is in them. Gene Kelly is my favorite male dancer...but I also enjoy his singing and acting. I love his athletic/masculine way of dancing and yet it is so polished and can be so expressive that just a slight movement can be quite a sight to behold.  I highly recommend An American in Paris, it is such a beautifully done film.  Anchor's Aweigh and On the Town are just plain out fun loving and make my kids and I laugh heartily.  Brigadoon has interesting dancing in it (not the best of the bunch, probably the least as far as I am concerned)...but I have to admit I love listening to Van Johnson...he is hilarious!  He kind of reminds me of Han Solo in Star Wars.  He is SO ornery!!

The only thing that is disappointing is that this TCM DVD is in the full screen mode (sides cut off). I was expecting it to be in widescreen as it was when it was originally shown in the theaters.  That is why I gave this a 4 star rating.  However, these movies only came to $2.50 each so I can't complain too much about it...that's why I didn't give it less than 4 stars.",1469750400,,1163,4.183856502242152

On the content, On the Town, An American in Paris, Brigadoon and Anchor's Away have an eerie, Nationalist Socialist American post-war propaganda essence to it, like today's Disney Channel.
