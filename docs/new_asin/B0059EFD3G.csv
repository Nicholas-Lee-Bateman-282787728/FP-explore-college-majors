8650309,5,B0059EFD3G,"Just finished watching this movie.  I wasn't expecting much, but I was actually very entertained.  If you like post apocalyptic movies like Mad Max or The Ultimate Warrior then Final Executioner is for you.  Loads of action and all the things you look for in this kind of movie.  The hunting humans for sport theme as in The Most Dangerous Game and Turkey Shoot is well done (so is the revenge).  All together very entertaining.  Thumbs up!",1309651200,,440,4.64935064935065
