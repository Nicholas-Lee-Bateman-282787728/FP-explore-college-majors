5929311,4,B00ENZAZU8,The 3D effects are great. Very well shot. So close up to the bears and often camera is the bear itself's point of view. If you have a 3D TV and you like nature films this is a very good one to have.,1391385600,9,198,3.627906976744186

8607185,5,B00ENZAZU8,"First of all, let's get this straight . This is not for kids. Period. If a person has the maturity and the intelligence to grasp the disturbing implications of global climate change.,then this epic of film-making, in amazingly high quality and unique underwater and under polar ice 3-D photography, should be required viewing, and would be appropriate for high-school age children who can handle the real message that is under-lying . It can be watched over and over, it is that good.",1416528000,2,484,4.914634146341464
