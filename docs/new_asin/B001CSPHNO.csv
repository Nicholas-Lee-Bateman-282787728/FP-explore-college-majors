3517637,5,B001CSPHNO,"This is really a wonderful story, about a girl finding herself, and growing up.  Very relateable, and for a change, very realistic.

If you are a fan of the manga, you will love it, its basically frame for frame the same thing, except with vocals, colors, and music!  its fantastic.  The box and packaging is stylish and beautiful as well.  The English Dub isn't that great, if you ask me, but I'm rarely ever a fan of dubs to begin with, so perhaps I'm not quiet the best judge of that.

Its not an anime for children, there are alot of adult themes, and they are very graphic with their language, not necessarily vulgarity but sexual talk.  Its a great coming of age story, with adult themes, and personal growth, like any good coming of age story should have.  The ending isn't typical, and isn't what you'd expect from a ""girls anime"".

Definitely worth checking out, definitely worth the money, a great series, loads of fun, great sound track, beautiful animation, great voice acting (in the Japanese at least) very good all around :)",1234224000,7,1039,4.603260869565218
3517638,4,B001CSPHNO,"I missed this series when it was first released and was very glad to see the re-release as a box set.  The story is stronger on character than plot.  I liked all the characters; I even warmed a little to George, the manipulative and frankly misogynistic fashion designer that high school girl Yukari is infatuated with.  Yukari has been groomed by her mother to focus on scholastic achievement, and when George's fashion design team, Paradise Kiss, approaches her to be a model for their showcase dress, she sees a new world of creativity and possibility open for her.  At first she thinks that George is the reason for this, but she comes to realize that it's what she herself wants and has to offer that matters.  If she hadn't figured this out, I wouldn't have had much patience for the show.  However, Yukari's passion for George and her pain over his hot and cold treatment of her is really well portrayed.  It's a good depiction of this time when you're trying to figure out what you want to do in life and hoping to find love with someone else, but learning to value yourself at the same time.  It was important that George learned to see Yukari as more than a mannequin for him to hang a dress on.  I wish this series had been longer.  The bittersweet ending was believable, but I wish more had been told about what happened to everybody.

The anime looks gorgeous.  If you're into the fashion aspect of the story, you won't be disappointed (I want that butterfly ring!)  I also really like the music, not just the opening and closing themes, but also the incidental music.  (Opening theme: ""Lonely in gorgeous"" by Tommy february6/Closing theme:  ""Do you want to"" by Franz Ferdinand)

This is one romance anime that isn't silly, although it has genuinely funny moments.  It also has mature adult content and is not for younger kids or immature people who cannot handle adult relationships.",1227916800,3,1897,4.648648648648648

8289061,5,B001CSPHNO,"This is a lovely story. the characters at first seem selfish at first but they grow on you.  I have looked at it several times and each viewing was enjoyable.

8289064,5,B001CSPHNO,"I purchased Paradise Kiss and Nana (both in DVD and manga formats) for the simple fact that I am an ardent fan of Yazawa Ai.  I adore her artwork plus she really knows how to tell a good story.  Her stories are known to be sensitive and realistic.  When you purchase her works, you also get the added bonus of enjoying the mangaka's keen aesthetic sense in fashion.",1302652800,,365,4.338235294117647
8289065,3,B001CSPHNO,"I had high hopes for ""Paradise Kiss,"" based on reading the manga and my familiarity with ""Nana,"" another work by the same artist, Ai Yazawa, that's also been adapted into anime. While ""Nana"" dealt with a gaggle of independent 20-somethings trying to make it on their own in Tokyo, set against a background of aspiring rock musicians, ""Paradise Kiss"" skews to a younger crowd, with a group of high school seniors caught up in designing, creating and modeling fashions. It starts out well as we get to know the different characters and learn their relationships and backgrounds and watch as the central character, initially an outsider, is plunged into their world, almost by accident. However, things lose momentum in the final third and the various characters grow less and less appealing. Still, a lot of excitement is generated in the first two-thirds.

Yukari is an average high school girl who never had any particular interest in fashion but gets recruited to model a dress for a group of students at a nearby art school. She's a straight-laced girl who's initially taken aback by the art students' free-spirited styles of dressing and living and their rather casual intimacy with each other, but she gradually gets seduced by it all, especially after they dress her up in their fashions. She falls for George Koizumi, the charismatic rich boy who's designing the dress, and they gradually begin a romance--the first she's ever had--despite the unspoken feelings of a male friend and classmate, Hiroyuki Tokumori, who shows real concern as Yukari's schoolwork is undermined by her new fashion adventures. Her other new friends include Arashi, an aspiring musician; Miwako, a cute little fashion plate who gives Yukari a new name, ""Caroline""; and Isabella, a lavishly dressed engimatic figure who harbors a secret that will already be known to readers of the manga but isn't revealed in the anime until the tenth episode. Yukari's strict mother is absolutely appalled at the changes her daughter is going through and eventually Yukari leaves home, crashing first at Arashi's pad and then moving in with George in the huge luxury apartment owned by his frequently absent father. It all builds up to the big senior show and Yukari's dazzling runway debut.

Yukari remains fascinating as long as there's a pull between one way of life and another. She's trying to find herself and goes so far as to quit school and immerse herself in the fashion exploits of her new friends and the lavish lifestyle of her new boyfriend. We're with her as long as she hangs onto some semblance of her old self. Danger signs appear, however, and it's never quite clear that Yukari heeds them. (George can be alarmingly controlling, for instance.) By the final volume (episodes 9-12), it's obvious that Yukari has changed--for the worse--and I, for one, stopped caring about her and her shallow, self-absorbed friends. (In the manga, more detail is provided, along with greater insights into Yukari's maturing process, and the characters don't seem so superficial.) Sure, it's refreshing to see young Japanese people breaking away from the regimented school life and fast academic track that seems to be the norm for so many Japanese youth. But what kind of alternative are they creating? What future is there in these rather overblown fashions? At some point, the fantasy they've built up constitutes such a rarefied world that it's hard to suspend any disbelief.

The postscript ending, seen during the end credits and taking place a few years into the future, tidies things up for the main characters, but in a rushed and unconvincing way. I needed more. The closing chapters of the manga give us a lot more, including an ending that brought tears to my eyes. The anime finale left me...indifferent.

Having said all that, I do recommend the series for its artistry. Many of the everyday fashion designs are very cute, especially the clothes worn by Miwako and her sister Mikako (an established designer in her own right). And it's fun to watch Yukari play this glorified game of dress-up and be transformed from a rather skinny, mousy sort of girl into a creature of beauty and high glamour. And the character designs are generally quite detailed and, in some cases, downright realistic. I like it when this kind of attention is paid. Plus, the background designs showing the streets of Tokyo and the various apartment, shop and studio interiors are all incredibly detailed. The series is a visual treat from start to finish, even after the dramatics start winding down.

The extras in the DVD set include an interview with Yu Yamada, a beautiful model who plays Yukari in her first voice-acting job, followed by a photo shoot with Yamada recreating an illustration of Yukari from the manga. There is a press conference with the director, the art director and three of the voice actors. Best of all, there's a 22-minute discussion of the show by the voice-actors who play George, Miwako, Arashi and Isabella. It's just them talking and some real insights are offered, especially when ""Arashi"" criticizes George's character and ""Miwako"" comes to his defense. The extras are all in Japanese with English subtitles.",1297036800,5,5198,4.990772779700115
8289066,5,B001CSPHNO,A must have for any anime fan. It's about a girl who was unsure of herself but in the end discovers her true personality.,1269820800,3,121,4.083333333333333
8289067,5,B001CSPHNO,"When I first started watching it, I didn't care for it but the animation won me over and unlike some series out there this one actually had an sense of closure to it, even if you don't like the way it ends.",1259884800,,206,3.9285714285714284
8289068,5,B001CSPHNO,"Realism, drama and romance. Those are some of the qualities normally required for me to respect and give a story a high rating. Paradise Kiss has a mix of all three.

In a nutshell, Paradise Kiss is a story of growth. Over the course of 12 episodes, a high school girl, Yukari, transforms from a normal girl feeling pressured into studying only to impress her parent; transforming into an independent woman who follows her own heart. An encounter with George, an overconfident and handsome fashion designer and head of a small group called Paradise Kiss from a fashion design school, leads her down the path of modeling and love.

I expected fashion to be the main focus of the series after reading a description of the story, but the fashion stuff barely featured outside of costume changes and a few key plot points. It was always in the background, never being more important than the characters. So, if you are worried, fear not: characterization was clearly the priority of the author, and I am glad that was the case since fashion and me do not go together so well. Nearly all of the story focused on the love/hate relationship of George and Yukari.

Throughout the story, George is blunt to the point of being insulting, and he has no problem telling Yukari things such as how he hates women who blame others for their problems (after she blamed her parent for pushing her), or informing her that she was an idiot for putting sleeping with him above her dream. While he was usually right and said what he did out of caring for her, his needlessly confrontational attitude made him a hard guy to understand at times.

Despite my problems with George's 'bad boy' personality, I do think their relationship, including how the two end up, was handled in a very realistic and mature manner. Never did I feel I was looking in on the actions of fake individuals; I could imagine the same events playing out in real life. Their relationship came across so realistically that watching them made me a little watery eyed a few times. After watching numerous anime stories involving plain, generic leads getting it on with soulless female characters, watching Paradise Kiss was a breath of fresh air.

It was also nice seeing an anime relationship not require the male to chase after the female. It was far more equal in Paradise Kiss, with Yukari doing most of the chasing because of George's attitude. She even had to basically beg him to sleep with her after he picked up on her obvious hints but failed to take the easy openings she gave him, instead opting to make her do the work. I give major plus points for the story very rarely coming across as fake.

I only have a few negative comments about the story/characters. The first is that the relationship of George and Yukari seemed to move too fast at first, with George getting jealous after seeing Yukari out with another man, going on to ignore her... even though he had only known her for a few days. The other negative point is that the supporting cast did not get enough time. For example, I wanted to see more than Arashi and Miwako (members of Paradise Kiss) fight and have sex every now and then. Neither of the problems were severe enough to ruin the series for me, and I doubt most others would be troubled by what bugged me.

In terms of the video and audio aspects, the series is very impressive. The art looks wonderful, it being both realistic and stylish, the eyes in particular looking lovely, and the animation is up to the usual Madhouse standard. The soundtrack is a solid one, too, including an excellent opening and a few memorable pieces. As for the voice acting, the English dub is excellent, with all of the cast sounding natural.

All in all, Paradise Kiss is something either gender can enjoy. Going into it, I was a little concerned, worrying that I would not be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of it because of my gender, but I was able to get into it right from the get-go. If you are tired of all the silly, over the top anime in existence, I suggest you give this a try. If in doubt, do not avoid one the best anime out there just because you are not female.

Rating: 9/10",1249516800,17,4159,4.534666666666666
