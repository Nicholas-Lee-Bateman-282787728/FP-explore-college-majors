8055949,3,B0008FPINQ,"Hiruko The Goblin was an interesting film that could have been better.

The plot elements have the making of a good story and it actually starts off that way. In it, Yabe and two of his friends are on summer break and venture to their school to find his father, and another student, Reiko. Yabe has a crush on Reiko, but he's mostly admired her from a far up to this point. He also dislikes the fact that she shares an interest with his father, which is archeology. In any case, the boys get to the school grounds where they find Reiko, but something's amiss. Reiko appears to be with another student, who's she's already involved with romantically. This devastates Yabe, but everything's not as it seems as the film progresses. Eventually, the boys discover that the school has been overrun with Goblins. At some point, an amature archeologist, Heda, also shows up at the school. He's been trying to prove the existence of goblins with his work and that's why he arrives on the scene. Together, he and Yabe try to determine what's been going on at the school, and what's been happening to the others. The film eventually reaches a melancholy conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well, I did like some elements of this film. Yabe's crush on Reiko and wondering what happened to her, works well. The addition of the goblins, and how they choose to present themselves, was rather creepy and creative at the same time. Taking the head of a human and making it your own, on a spider body, was a good idea. It also gave the film an opportunity to do a lot of quick, chaotic, ground level filming. I also liked the fact that Reiko would sing periodically throughout the film. There was a reason for this, which I won't share, it would only spoil things for you.

But the film's not perfect. My main complaint is it focuses way too much on Heda and Yabe wondering through the school. The others exit the film too soon in my opinion. They should have stuck around for more plot development. And Reiko's fate adds an interesting dynamic to the story, since Yabe still has a crush on her, but it didn't play out as well as it could have. Also, Heda has several home-made gadgets, which he uses periodically on the goblins, similar to the Ghost Buster guys, with their off the wall devices. But they're mostly used as a form of comic relief. They wern't a serious element to the movie.

So in the end, I gave the film a three. It's not particularly scary, although it did jump me a few times. It's mostly a horror/comedy/fantasy story. It's not the kind of flick you have to see before you die or anything, but it's mildly entertaining, if you're interested in it. I'd say one of the best elements in the film overall, is the soundtrack.  Between the synth based score and Reiko's occasional vocals,  it could be the type of soundtrack I wouldn't mind having. An ok film at best, if you're into campy horror.",1440374400,,2899,4.501901140684411

8055952,4,B0008FPINQ,"In a filmed interview, director Shinya Tsukamoto was asked why this film was so different from his previous ones.  He stated he just wanted to make a film like some of the films he loved as a child.  This was the same stupid question most interviewers ask any creative artist:  Why did you paint, write, compose, direct, etc. a work that's different from your other works? The real answer is:  Because I wanted to!  Why would any real artist want to be strait-jacketed or pigeon-holed?

I think most viewers just don't get it.  Hiruko the Goblin is not an art-house movie.  It isn't symbolic or multi-layered:  it's just a lot of fun!  The director paints a humorous, occasionally nostalgic look at early teen age life.  The youths in Hiruko are still innocent, but no longer 100% so, adults for the most part are too serious and VERY boring, and strange and mysterious things can still happen to the young.  This affectionate idealized view is paired with the appearance and bloody antics of the all-too-nasty goblin, Hiruko.  Enter the disgraced professional anthropologist who is more like a grown-up teenager than one of ""them"" (i.e., boring adults), and the adventure begins:  Hiruko must be stopped!

Another criticism leveled against this movie is the ""low budget"" special effects.  Guess what, folks? This is a horror comedy about young people (and the young at heart).  Do you remember what is was like watching cheesy horror movies that scared the crap out of you when you were young, but seem laughable when you view them now?  Well the horror effects in Hiruko are far better than most of those, but still imbued with affection and just enough cheesiness to satisfy the whole tone of the movie.  I think the actors do a great job as well.

In my view, the only other movie that bears comparison to Hiruko the Goblin is Re-animator.  Both have an unbelievable, outrageous sense of humor, although Re-animator certainly isn't nostalgic.  With both films, you just have to let go and let the movie entertain you - and it will.

Enjoy!",1381795200,,2043,4.774285714285714
8055953,5,B0008FPINQ,I loved all the Tetsuo movies and I am a big fan of Tsukamoto directing/acting. I believe I have seen all his directed movies. This movie was a lot of fun to watch and I enjoyed the craziness involved. It had a bit of everything in it including humor and the Goblin was worth seeing.,1329782400,,283,4.163636363636364
8055954,3,B0008FPINQ,"Hiruko the Goblin (Shinya Tsukamoto, 1991)

Sometimes it seems like every Shinya Tsukamoto fan on the planet hates Hiruko the Goblin. Now that I've actually seen it, I'm not entirely sure why. I get it in context-- Hiruko, Tsukamoto's second film, was nothing at all like his first, Tetsuo: The Iron Man-- but now that we have sixteen years of hindsight and know that it was Tetsuo and not Hiruko that was the odd man out, perhaps it's time for some of the movie's harsher critics to revisit it. It's silly, and it's dumb, but it's quite funny and not nearly as awful as I'd been led to believe.

The story concerns a school that was built atop a burial mound containing a trapped goblin named Hiruko. An archaeological expedition unwittingly frees Hiruko, who gets up to his old tricks again pronto. (These tricks consist of things like beheading people and possessing attractive young women.) A goblin-hunter shows up and works with the son of one of the folks who's disappeared to try and figure out what's going on.

Hiruko was made with a slightly larger budget than Tetsuo, but it's still pretty obvious Tsukamoto was working in the basement for this one. To me, that just adds to its charm; this isn't a lavish production like Tsukamoto's more recent films, so you get cheap special effects and an amateurish patina over everything. But to balance it out, the film is earnest without ever taking itself at all seriously; every time it has a chance to go for the laugh, it does. (Note that the American equivalent would not be an Adam Sandler or Chris Farley movie; early-period Peter Jackson is a bit closer to the mark.)

A very fun and unjustly neglected movie. Well worth checking out. ***",1206403200,7,1699,4.672240802675585
8055955,4,B0008FPINQ,"alright now, i think this film happens to be a little misunderstood. there's no way it aims to be artsy, amazing, or even a ""great film"" depending on your definition of such. it's meant to be a fun little slice of z-movie camp for the fans of that old school cheese. and i think it pulls this off successfully. if you're looking for a cheesy comedy/gore/horror flick complete with the classic stop motion animation technique, this film is a valentine to people such as yourself. you won't see any CG crap in this one. it's all low budget puppets and mechanics baby(old school). now that doesn't necessarily make anything automatically good, but it should give you an idea about what to expect.

the story itself is decent, but nothing to expect much out of. there's a loose goblin that goes by the name of hiruko, and it's running amok the school grounds taking people's heads. enter heida and masao to attempt to save the day. that's pretty much all you need to know. i think the film begins to slightly fall apart near the end, with the best of it being shown in the middle with some classic abandoned school scares. but even then i was captivated to the end by the strange charm of this japanese title.

i'm a pretty big fan of tsukamoto, and while i realize this is definitely not one of his best works out there, it still shouldn't be forgotten. i think a handful of the viewers that came out disappointed were expecting some sort of artsy film that they could pretend they understood and discuss their loose interpretations of it. hiruko is NOT that. this is just a classic cheesy horror romp meant for some popcorn viewing and that's it. go in with a grindhouse attitude, and you should leave entertained by this strange japanese title.",1177632000,12,1743,4.583333333333333
8055956,2,B0008FPINQ,"""Hiruko The Goblin,"" by director Shinya Tsukamoto is not a very good film. In fact, it's pretty bad. If strange and weird Japaneses films are your delight, however, this one will definitely sate your appetite. My wife usually puts up with many of my films, especially my Japanese films, but this one was the cake for her a few years back. She actually left the room. Now, I don't blame her. Afterall, she has put up with quite a few of my Foreign films. And as the reviewer below has written: ""This film won't win any Oscars."" The director of this particular film, Shinya Tsukamoto, is also the director of the TETSUO films.

Without giving away too much in the film, the main character, Hieda Reijirou (Kenji Sawada) is an archaeologist who likes inventing things from kitchen utensils. As the film begins, he has made an archaeological discovery [a mound over a school house]. The film then moves to the other characters named Takashi Yabe (Naoto Takenaka) and Tsukishima Reiko (Megumi Ueno) who are both exploring a cave when some unseen force chases after them. Apparently, a Goblin inhabits the cave, and Heida must attempt to seal off the mound before this Goblin makes people saw off their heads. It [the Goblin] has a head for a body and spider-like legs.

To make a long story, of a pretty bad film short, both Heida Reijouro and Masao Yabe [the son of Takashi Yabe from the earlier cave scene] get together to try and solve this mystery. There is plenty of gushing blood and gore in the film, if these are the types of films you like. However, if you are looking for complex characters or a good plot, you will find yourself at a loss. This is not a very good film, however, I have seen worse. Recommended only if like me you love Japanese films, and refuse to take advice from friends when it comes to viewing Japanese films, and therefore must watch it yourself. I must admit however, it is a very weird and strange film. [Just don't expect too much from the film, however].",1169596800,,1986,4.560224089635854
8055957,3,B0008FPINQ,"i found this to be an entertaining slice of Japanese horror/camp with an obvious nod to previous films,both horror and otherwise. A definite sense of humor is evident thru-out,so i think to fully appreciate this one must bear that in mind. This is no ""art film"",but an attempt at simple fun that doesn't tax the brain.

personally, i think it achieves that!",1131926400,13,357,4.758064516129032
