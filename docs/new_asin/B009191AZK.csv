8533881,2,B009191AZK,"Taped Sinawali Class:
This video is very disappointing.  It is informally taped in a class setting with little thought given to a teaching demonstration.  The techniques, though not done at full speed are shown much too fast to learn from.  The techniques/drills are not difficult and when demonstrated slow a few times an average student would quickly pick them up to practice alone and with a partner. This video would do little for a beginning student who attends Sinawali classes.  Almost nothing is shown concerning footwork and very little correct footwork, if any is seen by anyone in this class setting.  The video is poorly organized and does little as an instructional video.  For the quality of material presented the cost is exorbitant.  This short video is listed as Part 1, hopefully if there is ever a Part 2 considerably more effort will be put into a much better  presentation.  A FMA enthusiast/student/practitioner  can find numerous other videos with excellent instruction for both learning and review.  This Video is NOT recommended.",1443916800,,1054,5.105263157894737
