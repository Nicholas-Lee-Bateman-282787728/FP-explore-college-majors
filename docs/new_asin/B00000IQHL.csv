7911399,5,B00000IQHL,"This is an older film made prior to the end of the war in '95.
However, the scenery is beautiful.  Shows most of the larger cities on the Adriatic Coastline in what is now Croatia, with a few southern cities as well.
Good, basic information.  Does not really show the magnificent beauty of the Adriatic Sea.
I do enjoy it and brings back the wonderful memories I have from my visit there in 2000.
Thank you for offering this video for sale. I hope you offer more on Croatia in the future.",1000339200,2,488,4.293478260869565
