8072687,1,B000A2VN1S,"I ordered two DVD's to help train my lab retriever and get him on the road to becoming a great gundog.  Every trainer I have spoken to have all based their training on reward training and we had great results, I just wanted to see how they trained dogs across the pond, my initial thoughts, disgusting.  All that happens is the dog is made to yelp each time it doesn't do what its asked oh and, the odd elec shock here and there.  I am so disgusted with what I saw, I didn't watch it all and im now approaching Amazon for a full refund.  My advice, don't waste your money, treat your dog with respect and kindness and it will work wonders, ours is doing fantastic",1175644800,,663,4.196850393700787
