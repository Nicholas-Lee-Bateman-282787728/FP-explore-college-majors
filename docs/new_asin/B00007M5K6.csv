1822791,1,B00007M5K6,"Like many of you when I saw the actors listed for this movie I thought it would be pretty good but boy was I wrong.  Horrible acting, horrible directing.  Very low budget, my first college production type movie.  Everyone involved should have stopped and said we could do better.  Do not waste your money nor your time, mark my words it is horrible.  As said on the old In Living Color show ""Hated it"".",1208044800,4,402,4.378378378378378
1822792,1,B00007M5K6,"Crime Partners is based on a book by one of the greatest black amercian authors Donland Goines. But I imagine Goines is rolling over in his grave after this. In the lead role Tyrin Turner destoys any promise he showed almost ten years ago in Meance II Society. In the form of his sidekick we get a no name actor named John ""B.J."" Bryant who needs some silmfast. Even the always talnted Clifton Powell is wasted and what's up with the wig my brotha had in this movie it's like someone dipped a mop in oil and glued it to his head. As for those who wanna see the movie for the rappers they don't appear until the last fiffteen minutes. This is the reason ghetto cinema has a bad name.",1206489600,2,682,4.213740458015267
1822793,1,B00007M5K6,"This Movie is very poorly put together. I've read the book and it's the first of a 4 part story. This movie dosen't capture what the book does. The Movie Never Die Alone with DMX was based on a Donald Goines novel and that movie was put together properly. This was a low budget film and anyone could've done better. If you want to feel the Movie somewhat you have to read the book first. Donald Goines is one of my Favorite authors, this Movie should've been done a lot better. Check for Never Die Alone with DMX, it's a better movie than this, However Never die alone the book is better than the movie. I give this movie 1 star just cause I've read the book and can see where the movie was going. It was directed poorly and is a disgrace to the Novel.",1202256000,,752,4.157534246575342

1822795,1,B00007M5K6,"I love the ""urban gangsta"" movies.  I can watch them all day.  This movie was BS.  It deserves no stars.  The dialogue is terrible, the plot makes no sense... this is really bad.  There are times when the dialogue is said twice and you can tell it should have been edited.  At one part a girl is talking about someone who got arrested earlier and is in jail. Then the guy who's supposed to be in jail is at the club with them and buys them champagne... what's up with that? Stuff like this happens the whole 100 minutes.  Its like they filmed a whole bunch of scenes at a couple of different times and somebody tried to edit it and add in more scenes and come up with something that made some kind of sense.  I could act better than this when I was 5.  This was sad.  This movie took the genre back 40 years.",1123286400,4,808,4.089171974522293
1822796,3,B00007M5K6,"I didn't expect this movie to any better than what it was. I'm glad  someone finally used a Donald Goines book  to make a movie instead of just writing some terrible screenplay. What I hate is giving rappers top billing when they are no more than just cameo performers. Stop lying to the consumer. That's false advertising. John Bryant is an integral part of this film and his name doesn't even appear on the cover. That is so disrespectful. His name should have been third behind Tyrin Turner and Clifton Powell. With all considered, I don't think this movie was that terrible. I've seen much worse.",1092700800,2,600,4.650943396226415
1822797,1,B00007M5K6,"This movie was terrible. Im shocked because i usually like ghetto/gangsta movies, but this was just 2 much. For yall trying to see this for the rappers they don't appear until the movie is close to over. i mean what is this (BLEEP). and to think this is based on a story written by a famous black novelist. its a good thing i got the rent this movie free. you don't have to take my word, go and see you might think differently,but don't be shocked if u wind up regreting this. i still do. i definelty never wanna see this movie again. not even on T.V. im out. peace!",1058227200,7,566,4.154545454545454
1822798,3,B00007M5K6,"THE MOVIE IS ABOUT TWO GANGSTAS WHO GET TIRED OF THEIR MURDERS GOING UNRECOGNIZED. BUT WHEN THEY MURDER TWO DOPE FIENDS, THEY MAKE THE FRONT PAGES OF SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS, THEN THEY START DOING MURDERS FOR A MAN NAMED KENYATTA [CLIFTON POWELL], BUT AS THE NUMBER OF MURDERS GROW, THE COPS ARE GETTING CLOSER TO BRINGING THESE THUGS DOWN. NOT MUCH, BUT AT TIMES, IT IS OKAY. YOU GOTTA ADMIT ONE THING, CLIFTON POWELL LOOKS SILLY IN DREADS. THE MOVIE HAS CAMEOS FROM A HOST OF RAPPERS; JA RULE, CHARLI BALTIMORE, CORMEGA, SNOOP DOGG, ANGIE MARTINEZ, AND ICE-T. OF INTEREST ONLY FOR TYRIN TURNER [WHO STARRED IN THE FAMED ''MENACE II SOCIETY''] AND CLIFTON POWELL. OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE DIRECT TO VIDEO GANGSTA MOVIE.",1058054400,5,724,4.846774193548387

7978384,5,B00007M5K6,"This is a classic to me. This is one of my all time favorites of hood movies, and I only have two which is ""Crime Partners"" and ""Paid In Full."" I have seen a number of hood movies, and others were so phony and poorly produced with bad acting, I could not waist my time watching. I only have two favorites because most hood movies are poorly made with corny acting, producing and everything. And many hood movies made by rich hollywood producers(like New Jack City,etc.) are just as phony as hood movies made by unprofessional ""Jo blows"" from the hood. Hollywood made hood movies with their fine production and big budgets don't have realism to them. For those of us who truely lived a hard core gritty ghetto life we know a real hood movie when we see one, because it hits so close to our real life experience. If this movie had actors who could not play their part well, and bad production, it could not have made my list of a classic hood movie. What makes this movie real to life is that the actors are all from the ghetto(like myself) and they actually lived the part, so they were not acting they were playing characters that they really lived. Most brothers from the hood can play such parts better than other roles because they live those lives everyday(like Snoop Dog,Ice T and the others),in fact Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff who produdced this movie is doing life in prison now because he just could not pull away from the hood gangster lifestyle. This movie ""Crime Partners"" is one of the realest ghetto flicks I have seen. Good acting, good soundtrac,etc.",1410048000,,1564,4.549645390070922
7978385,1,B00007M5K6,This movie is an insult to ALL hood films. I should have stook with my old No Limit films. Does the book an injustice. Cain from Menace II Society look like was on crack.,1323216000,,170,4.029411764705882
7978386,1,B00007M5K6,"i have read many books by donald goins and have enjoyed them all. so when i saw this movie i thought that it would be just as good. it was awful. i wish that i could have had a preview of the movie before purchasing it. nothing but drugs, sex, etc. and actors were not very good. hated it!",1251676800,,289,3.9152542372881354
7978387,4,B00007M5K6,If you like Donald Goines you are going to love this movie because this movie brings his book to life.....some of the actors are a little week but the other rappers are awesome......this movie is a must have and a must see.,1231718400,,223,4.333333333333333
