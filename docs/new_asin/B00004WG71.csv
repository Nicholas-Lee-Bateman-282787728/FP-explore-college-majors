1364285,5,B00004WG71,"I was in the video store and I happened to walk by the music videos and saw Aaron's video laying there, so i picked it up and bought it.  I am way  older than Aaron, but I just love his cute, adorable smile. He definitely  is following brother Nick's footsteps in the looks department.  Well  anyways enough drooling... OK the video has 5 full length music videos from  his upcoming album.  They are ""Aaron's party,""  ""I want  candy,""  ""Bounce,""  ""Iko Iko,"" and ""The  clapping song."" It also has behind the scenes footage of Aaron  shooting the videos. I'm sure most of you already know what Aaron's party  is about, so I'll tell you about the other songs/videos.
I want candy-  Aaron has a crush on a girl named Candy and spends time with her but his  buddies keep following him around on his date...funny video.
Bounce-  Aaron's hanging around the courts and plays one-on-one with a big  basketball player and wins.
Iko Iko-It's that song about setting each  others grandma's pants on fire...ha ha...you've probably heard it before  'cause its a remake. Aaron and his crew are sitting  around a little  bonfire at the beach.
The clapping song- Aaron does a lot of dancing in  this video. He's a great dancer. They are on the pier at the beach. The  lyrics are kinda funny, but hey he's just a kid.
Well there, I hope this  helped.  And all you Aaron fans go get this video, its really cool. You  won't regret it.",967593600,28,1414,4.507936507936508
1364306,5,B00004WG71,"This video (or I should say DVD) on Aaron Carter rocks. I'm a 17-year-old girl who loves Aaron Carter's music. He can rap, sing, dance, and he's cute. What more could you ask for? Also, he comes from one of today's most talented families - the Carters, which also include older brother Nick (Backstreet Boys) and older sister Leslie, who just recently started her own singing career.
This DVD is based on Aaron's 2000 smash hit album, AARON'S PARTY (COME GET IT). It features the full music video of the title track for this CD, which is obviously called ""Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"", and it's a really cool music video. It also features snipets from the music videos of ""I Want Candy"" and ""Bounce"". This disc also includes a behind-the-sceens look at the making of his videos, and other bonus stuff like interviews with Aaron and even snipets of his concerts.
This DVD is definitely worth your $12.99 if you're an Aaron Carter fan. If you get the DVD version, it also comes with a trivia game on Aaron Carter! This is totally cool and sometimes it can be funny, too. A must have for all Aaron Carter fans. Actually, you don't even have to be an Aaron Carter fan. Maybe if you see this video you'll learn he's a real kid and start respecting him more. I love Aaron, Nick, and the Backstreet Boys!",995760000,5,1297,4.5

1364308,1,B00004WG71,"This guy is a wannabe. He couldn't even dance if his life depended on it. My sisters friend loves him. She has way bad taste. Anyone who buys it isn't getting their money's worth. Heck, buyin that is like burning a twenty dollar bill. DON'T BUY IT!!!",992476800,2,250,4.340425531914893
1364309,5,B00004WG71,"Aaron Carter is a young pop star and I really really like him not just because he is soooo.... handsome but also I like the way he sings..I like his video of Aarons party and its gonna makes me wants to scream!! oh gash!! he is the best,I like the way he raps and this album is just right for the teen agers or even to the elders ..Actually I always play this song whenever I had a party with my friends at home I turn on the radio like its new year and this makes my neighborhood comes along with us and had our party together. When the party started I screamed""Aaron's Party come get it.......""And that's why I was the one of his craziest fan. In this video Ilike most when he says""grounded"" why????? because even though that he has been scolded by his dad he still smile when he speaks this word and it reminds of my self..You know, the first time that I saw this video I experience of having an interest to buy a copy of his album and spends me a lot of time to buy his album coz I need to earn much money. But its not a big problem at all as long as I could grab a copy of my idol's album..For me he is the best forget the rest!!!! This is my motto and I hope I could see him in person coz its my greatest dream and i know its a dream of alot of his fans all over the world.....I really had a good time watching of his albums video especially of aaron's party coz in this album it shows that right now he is a real man and not a child anymore that I've known before..Just like when he was still a ten year old just like me before I couldn't stop thinking of him  and I Know its just a normal. Of all my favorite pop stars he is the only one that last long coz I always knew ""Aaron's  the best forget the rest.....""",989280000,,1719,3.9226361031518624
1364310,5,B00004WG71,"(I am a 13) I highly recommend Aaron's Party to go volume 73. He's so dream-tastic.... yummy. I would like to drip pickle juice all over his pet hampster and suck it off. He wants candy and oh.. so do I, as long as it comes out of his  pocket covered in lint.  His video showing him playing shaq in a basketball game is so realistic.  Shaq didn't even ask for any money to be in the video because he and Erin a bestest friends.
Of course Erin can beat Shaq. Shaq is only a little over seven feet tall, while Erin towers over Shaq's left kneecap. Of course every 20 year old male wants to be in a video with a kindergartner with his name across their chest.
Those girls are only using Erin to get to his older brother. Although, this is the best video ever released, since the Titanic and Star Wars.  Because, ""Boom he put it in the hoop, he said jam, I love that Sam I am. That's how he will never beat Jack.",987292800,3,908,4.055865921787709
1364311,4,B00004WG71,"This video is quite short, you see 5 clips, and some interviews. If you want to buy this video, buy the DVD not the vhs, the DVD has more options to play with and more content. The image quality is very good and the sound is spectacular. There are some nice dance moves, and you will enjoy whatching those video clips. By the way, the DVD is not available in Canada, only the VHS, and its only Amazon who has this DVD. So hurry up and grab one of them cause you won't have the chance again since it will be out of print.",983404800,,520,4.009615384615385

7925200,5,B00004WG71,"We bought for the kids, they all have seen him in concert and on MTV. This dvd gave them insight to how Aaron was at 12 years old, they were amazed of the songs and dancing in the show. There comments were it does not even seem to be the same person, he was happy and go lucky here, not like on his MTV Cribs show were he went off on guys. My oldest said this is more fun than lot of his newer shows, we were bit shocked since she said she would not watch this if we bought it, said it was for little kids, yet she has watched it few times here self.

Good dvd for any age group.a",1246665600,,580,3.7540983606557377

All it is is Aaron on a beach waving streamers around. 5.4/5 Clapping Song- I'm not sure what it's about but I do like the dance routine.,996710400,3,454,4.352941176470588
