8258226,5,6303937403,After seeing this show you will be like 'oh yea! What a night!' Lol the show is really good. In my opinion the best king of the ring. You get an underrated classic with Mero and austin. Jake vs Vader was short but for some reason entertaining lol the tag title match was ok but I'm bias because I liked classic old tag teams lol warrior vs king was cool because warrior was very colorful and king and warrior what a unique combo to have wrestle hmm and king insulted fans with one liners and such and did a pile driver so was cool...... um Ahmed vs goldust was cool as well because Ahmed was shiny lol and goldust performed well.. taker vs mankind was a CLASSIC early war. Loved the chair shot to the head and all the awesome action in this one. Austin beat Jake in the finals in a short beatdown. Did the 316 speech. Rest is on every wwe dvd. Owen was funny on commentary by the way all night. And finally hbk beat bulldog in a great main event. Just the super kick was botched at the end like from the 96 royal rumble on diesel... nice ending too with warrior coming in to save him and Ahmed against camp Cornette was unique seeing them three in the ring together... hope u liked the review,1412121600,,1192,4.1869565217391305

June 23, 1996

Semifinals in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Marc Mero

Very good match that could ahve been better. Austin got his lip busted open and had to go to the hospital. Austin wins. ***1/2

Semfinals in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Jake Roberts V. Vader

I don't remember how Jake wins, but he does and thats all you need to know. 1/4*

Smoking Gunns (Champions) V. Godwinns

Just listen to the commentary over this match, you will like it better. Gunns retain. 1/2*

Ultimate Warrior V. Jerry Lawler

umm...Warrior wins. DUD

Undertaker V. Mankind

This is one of those matches that you enjoy watching but isn't very good. Do you know what I mean? Mankind gets the huge upset over Taker. **

Goldust (Champion) V. Ahmed Johnson

not a very good match at all. I enjoyed looking at Terri at ringside better. Johnson wins the title. *1/2

Finals in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Jake Roberts

Not a good match but one of the book. Austins wins the 1996 King Of The Ring. 1/2* Then Austin says his most famous lines ever about Austin 3:16 and whatnot. You know the rest.

WWF Championship:

Shawn Michaels (Champion) V. British Bulldog

awesome match. Very good wrestling by both men. Michaels retains. ****

8258228,5,6303937403,"This was one of the best and most memorable King of the Ring's ever.  It is memorable because this is where Austin 3:16 all started.  Live from Milwaukee, Wisconsin this PPV is full of all kinds of good wrestling.  The main event is Shawn Michaels vs. The British Bulldog for the title in one heck of a fight.  Really good match, almost *****.  This event also features Austin and Jake the Snake Roberts in the King of the Ring finals.  Also on this PPV is the Ultimate Warrior vs. Jerry Lawler (fun match).  The IC Title also changes hands when Goldest takes on Ahmed Johnson.  Very good crowd reaction through the night makes this a quality PPV.  Almost forgot, the PPV also features one of the first encounters between Undertaker and Mankind and also a ***** between Stone Cold and Marc Mero!!!!!  GREAT event that is also Historical!!!!!",1056326400,2,841,4.621621621621622
