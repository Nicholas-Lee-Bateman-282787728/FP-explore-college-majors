8761254,4,B01FR35F2M,I really enjoyed this movie. It was fast moving and I liked the way the timeline moved forwards and backwards. The personal sacrifices made by this patriot were depicted well in the story.,1513123200,,188,4.7272727272727275
8761255,4,B01FR35F2M,"Sure we know all about the Nazis, the war, the war crimes, but we know little about life as an average German citizen during that time. Thanks to other movies we now know there was an active resitance in Germany. This movie deals with what we call to today ""The Lone Wolf"" some one who acts alone. The movie switches back and forth from his planting of the bomb, to his life before, to his torcher , to his life before. The one part I don't get is when after they arrest him, the Guestpo asks for his name and birth date, but he says nothing, even while going through intense torcher. I myself am thinking dude tell them, they already know.",1512432000,,640,4.254098360655738

8761257,5,B01FR35F2M,"Don't let the low scores by the reviews so far keep from this film.  Yes, subtitles are annoying for some but if you can overlook that jump into watching 13 minutes.  The lead, Christian Friedel is excellent.",1507766400,3,208,4.594594594594595
8761258,3,B01FR35F2M,"""13 Minutes"" (2015 release from Germany; 114 min.; original title: Elser: Er htte die Welt verndert--Elser: He Would've Changed the World"") brings the story of Georg Elser. As the movie opens, we see him installing the bombing device to attempt to assassinate Hilter in Munich on November 8, 1939. Alas, the attempt fails as Hitler unexpectedly leaves earlier than planned. It's not long before Elser is picked up by the Nazis, and the interrogation starts. We then go back in time to 1932 to learn more about what drove Elser. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, while I was aware of the fact that Hilter was almost assassinated at one point, this is the first time that I learn of the details of it. In theory this should make for a riveting drama. Alas, as brought by director Oliver Hirschbiegel (who previously gave us the excellent ""Diana"" bio-pic starring Naomi Watts), this is anything but riveting. The primary reason for this is that the acting is just all too staged, you can practically hear Hirschbiegel yell ""and... ACTION!"". It bothered me quite a bit, and it's a shame as this is an important ""detail"" of WWII that more people should understand better. Beware as well that some of the torture scenes are very intense and not easy to watch. Bottom line: this movie feels like a missed opportunity...

This movie premiered in Germany in early 2015. I have no idea what now, two and a half years later, this shows up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Saturday screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (5 people in total). I can't see this playing in the theater very long. If you are interested in the movie, you'll have to most likely check it out on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1503446400,2,1929,4.604651162790698
