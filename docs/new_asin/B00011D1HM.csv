1964816,5,B00011D1HM,"Some of the Bulldog movies have poor picture quality, but this one is pretty good, except that it gets a little dark near the end.  If you like Nick and Nora Charles, you should like these movies.  They are light and entertaining.  As the butler would say, ""I rather liked it.""",1278892800,3,277,4.392156862745098
1964817,5,B00011D1HM,"Dating as far back as the silent film era, Bulldog Drummond, looking for mystery and adventure and always finding it, offered movie audiences an entertaining time. Perhaps the most fun came with the ""B"" series starring John Howard as our hero and lovely Heather Angel as his girl. A fine cast of ""B"" stalwarts such as H.B. Warner, Reginald Denny, E.E. Clive, and Elizabeth Patterson always kept this series fun.

This one starts off with a bang and moves at a good clip, making it one of the best in the series. A bank robbery Bulldog and Phyllis just happen upon provides the adventure while the real question, as always, was whether Hugh would ever make it to the alter with his cute girl Phyllis! She's given him a ten day ultimatum in this one, or she'll marry another. Can Bulldog manage not to blow his last chance with Phyllis and her skeptical aunt?

A mad painter, a radio holding a secret that Bulldog has sent to Phyllis in France, unknowingly putting her in harm's way, and a fine bad guy in Eduardo Cianelli make it nearly, but not quite impossible. This is definitely one of the more entertaining entries in the ""B"" series. James Hogan's snappy direction and a swift moving screenplay from Garnett Weston and Stuart Palmer give this one lots of zip.

A great ending wraps up everything nicely and gives audiences what they've been waiting for from the beginning: a chance for cute little Heather Angel and our hero John Howard to tie the knot! Fans of ""B"" films and series will find this one extremely enjoyable. Great fun!",1169942400,9,1537,4.622710622710622

Sure it may seem pale compared to today's entries but if you need a little time off you will enjoy this movie. Also it is full of world renowned character actors.

Not only is the wedding ceremony interrupted, but several times!

The town mayor is so determined to marry Drummond and his bride that he chases them through town reciting parts of the ceremony as they chase the bad guy!

1964926,5,B00011D1HM,"A sort of mindless escapism.  A formula series that woks, if you don't expect too much from it.  Crime detection at the grade school level.  Black and white.  No special effects.  No CSI.  No really taxing challenges.  If you do not want to be challenged and would rather relax, then this is a nice break.  The butler, as is often the case during this period, is the one with the brains.  Women are stereotyped.  The action hero goes in doing things where he wouldn't last 2 seconds in todays movies.  But of course he always wins by dumb luck.  The real value of the series is that it is a window into the times.  Audiences were not sophisticated, technology was simple, plots were not complicated.  As is often the case in stories of this time, the hero is a rich man about town with no real job and solves crimes as a public service.",1361318400,,836,4.3441558441558445
1964927,4,B00011D1HM,"That above accusation is hurled at our protagonist by an indignant French police commissioner, and maybe he's got something there. When Bulldog Drummond has to be trapped behind bars just to get him married, and then Bulldog's jail cell erupts in a devastating explosion... well, maybe, wedding bells just aren't meant to peal for this crimefighter. This film franchise had been trying to marry him off for several pictures now, except that some mystery caper always rears up. In BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S BRIDE does the old ball-and-chain affix itself to Hugh or the featured big bad? It's funny to me that the French police commissioner seems to be more incensed at Bulldog for his perceived flight from his lovely fiancee than for his having broken out of his prison. It's always toujour l'amour with them sappy French...

FYI: I am going to SPOILERize the hell out of this movie. Proceed at your own risk.

Captain Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond has been on his way to the altar more times than Elizabeth Taylor, only difference being that Elizabeth Taylor has actually managed to close the deal all those times. The dashing Captain and his long-suffering fiancee Phyllis Clavering (Heather Angel, lovely) are once more headed towards the altar, that is, until an explosion at the London and Southminster Bank threatens to derail the impending nuptials. Off Bulldog goes, shedding his happy groom persona and merrily in pursuit of the master crook Henri Armides (Eduardo Ciannelli). There goes Bulldog's vow to give up chasing mysteries.

Scotland Yard is prompt to seal off the surrounding area, except that the coppers fail to properly gauge the guile of Henri Armides. He slips the police cordon by passing himself as a barmy painter who gets himself carted away in an ambulance (but not before he slaps a bucket of paint on Drummond's hapless sidekick Algy Longworth). You sort of have to go along with the long coincidence of the villain's ending up in the unlived quarters Phyllis Clavering had only recently rented.

Armides' wily scheme is sidetracked when the radio (in which he'd hidden the bank loot) in Phyllis's flat decides to go mobile. Phyllis had gone on ahead of Hugh to Targemont, France, site of their wedding in three days' time, but she'd forgotten her radio and had asked that Hugh ship it to her in France. And so the action shifts over to Targemont.

Because you've got on that inquisitive expression, I'll mention that BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S BRIDE, running at just under an hour, is based on H.C. (""Sapper"") McNeile's short story ""Bulldog Drummond and the Oriental Mind."" Released in 1939, this would be John Howard's seventh and final turn as Bulldog Drummond, what with World War II just on the horizon, along with his future real-life heroics in the naval service. Howard is again quite good as Bulldog Drummond, refined and easy-going and very decent with the action sequences. The Bulldog Drummond series has always featured a light touch, but there may be even more slapstick humor in this one, mostly provided by Reginald Denny and E.E. Clive, both of whom return as, respectively, Hugh's bumbling pal Algy and Hugh's deadpan butler Tenny. I've always preferred Heather Angel to Louise Campbell in the Phyllis Clavering part. Angel just seems more, I dunno, down to earth, and she is seriously stunning to look at. Meanwhile, H.B. Warner had played Scotland Yard's Colonel Nielson for a few films now, but he never could escape John Barrymore's shadow. Warner plays Nielson as more stodgy and dimwitted, which boringly made him just like any other cop in the genre. Barrymore, at least, infused Nielson with a forceful persona.

The film's noteworthy set piece is staged during the third act, and it's a blend of farce and no-nonsense cops & robbers action. For whatever reason, Bulldog Drummond has landed in a French prison. I can't remember if it was Col. Nielson or Phyllis's Aunt Blanche who suggested it, but when they and Phyllis converge at the Targemont penitentiary, the French police commish is talked into then and there marrying off Hugh and Phyllis. Except that this was around the same time that Hugh is hot on the heels of the master thief. We observe one of those ridiculous but really fun sequences, in which the sprawling marriage service ranges from Hugh's blasted jail cell to the steep village rooftops and, finally, at the apartment of Phyllis's aunt, where further danger awaits. In the end, Bulldog Drummond gets his man. And so does Phyllis.",1311552000,,4486,4.950863213811421
