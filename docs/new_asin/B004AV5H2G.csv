4311711,4,B004AV5H2G,"Having lived in England, one might think that I shouldn't have had any problem understanding the actors in this series, but I must agree with other reviewers -- at times, I had absolutely no clue what was being said.  The regional accents are thick and the idioms are many; fair enough.  That makes for a more authentic production; on the other hand, it makes it tough for those outside the North of England to follow along.  Secondly, as is the case with many British productions, the sound quality is uneven.  There are a lot of sotto voce asides, uttered as the actors are striding along through an open field, or down a busy city street with lots of background noise.  Sometimes, you just can't hear what is being said. Still, this frustrating ""What did she just say?"" is often the price that we pay for superlative British drama. Blue Murder is a very good series -- especially the opening season.  Personally, I found the character of Janine to be increasingly annoying as the seasons progressed.  To be fair, though, I think that may be the point.  She is so invested in her balancing act, so frenetically busy keeping all the juggled balls in the air, that despite being a detective, she often cannot see what's going on under her nose.  After awhile, though, one simply wants to shake her -- as her children vie for some maternal attention and get into various difficulties; as her colleagues sometimes chafe at her high-handedness; as her loyal (and rather dishy) second-in-command falls for her without her seeming to understand the depth of his feelings. She is so self-absorbed that she unintentionally hurts him -- again and again. By the third series, though the dramas and acting are excellent, I had had just about enough of Janine.  Ditto the repetitive morning rush scenes of spilled cereal, Janine barking orders to her children, shuffling her papers, and gulping tea as she rushes out the door. We get it: she's busy; she's important; she's ironically clueless about the important things. Enough already!",1313107200,11,2025,4.826589595375722
4311712,4,B004AV5H2G,"I absolutely loved this show.  I particularly appreciated that the characters had lives outside the workplace which actually affected their work.  Unlike several other reviewers, I had no trouble understanding the dialogue. There were a few (maybe 5) lines in the entire series I didn't get, but otherwise it was quite easy for this deep-southerner to understand. This show feels more like The Last Detective than Life on Mars (my other favorites at this time), but has its own unique and distinctly English style.",1306800000,22,514,5.107142857142857
4311713,5,B004AV5H2G,"If you are into British murder mystery shows then you should find this series terrific.  The plots are intricate but very believable unlike what you get with American CSI laden over-the-top outrageousness.  You will certainly get plenty of fingerprinting and DNA analysis in these stories but in an amount that is sensible.  The regular cast of police characters are colorful with their own relationships to keep your interest beyond the murder case at hand.

It's jolly good as they say.",1302307200,2,488,5.0625
4311714,5,B004AV5H2G,"I can not say a lot bad about the series. I do wish DCI Lewis would get off the fence and start something with her leading man. My more serious issue was the lack of English Sub titles. I had to keep playing back too many parts of the movies because I did not understand what they were saying when they spoke fast, which is 75% of the time. All in all, I would like a lot more romance between the two of them. The great story lines, and ""who did it?"" aspect, make up for that. 5 Stars all the way!",1297382400,7,497,3.8823529411764706
4311715,5,B004AV5H2G,"Complex, gritty, dark, crime investigations in Manchester, UK, low district. DCI Lewis (Caroline Quentin-`Jonathan Creek','Men Behaving Badly') begins as a very pregnant, mom of 3, who catches hubby bedding another, and a new DI added to her team that was her own former relationship. What a web, and that's before the brutal crimes begin. The DCI & DI try on a spotty bit of romance but it's mildly plausible, just an oasis in a desert of murders, and both are better cops than lovers.
Abundant footage of Manchester architecture & some occasional beautiful countryside. On a rural hilltop with a scenic panorama as backdrop, DS Shap delivered the best line of the entire series: ""Who'd want to live out here? What is the point?""

Plenty of conflict--both fighting crime and within the detective team. DCI Lewis, mom of 4, is womanhood VS criminals. Single-parenting makes a subplot throughout. Also intra-detective relationships. Comedy lines come amid the routine of dirty, base crimes. This has no Brit rating but definitely for adult only due to language, gore, content, & visuals. ""Death in all it's glory."" No dark filth & crime to disgusting for ""Blue Murder.""

4311716,5,B004AV5H2G,"In late March of 2010, the UK TV station associated with bringing this fine show to the airwaves, ITV ditched the Caroline Quentin crime drama Blue Murder after (in the UK) five series - compiled as just four over here in the US within this collection.

""We honestly didn't suspect. So we haven't had the chance to say a lot of goodbyes. Everyone was sad when we found out,"" she said when asked about it the next month. And, having just watched the entire series in a night-after-night viewing session, I have to wonder quite why ITV took it upon themselves to breakup some a family!

The program, which starred Caroline Quentin as DCI Janine Lewis, first appeared on (UK) screens in 2003 and was last seen in October of 2009, when the final episode of series five (season four over here - please try to keep up!) aired.

Blue Murder - Set 1
`Cry Me A River' - Part 1
We open with Inspector Janine Lewis (Caroline Quentin) earning her stripes and becoming Detective Chief Inspector Lewis, being congratulated by her squad, and then going home to celebrate with her husband - and finding him in bed with the nanny! The entire series is full of these ups and downs for her, mostly showing her at-home life as a shambles re: an endless string of nanny's for her 3 kids - and one on the way!

The murder that sets the series off is committed on an allotment and, for the most part, drags itself through to the end of Part 1. The other main act to mention is the return to her squad of an old friend, DI Richard Mayne (Ian Kelsey) - someone who might well be the answer to her sexual tension!

`Cry Me A River' - Part 2
The pace picks up here with three suspects all getting narrowed down and eliminated as we progress. A lot more family issues crop up, and in truth they get in the way of the storyline. The plot twists and turns before the end, even dead ends unexpectedly at one point, and when revealed, well, it was semi-predictable!

`Hit & Run'
A body is fished out of the canal and at the same time, a hit and run outside a school is witnessed by DCI Lewis. Connected? Of course, but that's up to the squad to prove. DCI Lewis has given birth, a young daughter now makes her spawn at four, and she's back to work after her maternity leave. The story revolves around a Polish stripper, a seedy club, and comes complete with a wickedly unexpected twist ending!

`Up In Smoke'
A woman is found hanged in her father's estate house, but primarily this episode revolves around the coming and goings of a Crematorium. A real whodunit this one, for sure - great twist just at the end also!

`Fragile Relations'
A racial tone is the plot to this episode that smacks of real life torment between races, faith and belief systems. Muslims, whites, and African-American's fight constantly here, screaming and shouting racial abuse to one another. `The Lemon,' DCI Lewis' boss (as she calls him) is as stressed as ever and looking to pop a blood vessel or three come the final moments! In the end, the conclusion is down to personal greed.

`Lonely'
A horrible murder takes the lead here. Chaz, a Muslim cop from the beat, who helped out in the case before, is now with the squad (unannounced) but is gone by the time the next episode is shown! Anyway, an autistic child is the only witness to a murder and come the final reveal, well, I defy anybody to have guessed the true outcome beforehand!

Blue Murder - Set 2
`The Spartacus Thing'
The opening is incredibly sad, very realistically played out. In other episode news, DCI Lewis now has a new boss, `The Lemon `having been replaced by a female! The tale is slow to reveal itself here, a back burner plot to say the least, but just after the hour mark comes a nice twist! The ending is a little farcical, but works - I guess!

`Make Believe'
A young child is abducted from a play ground, and a few days later a child of similar looks and age is found dead down a drain. Weirdly, and tangential, DCI Lewis' kids have grown up tremendously and are not actually ""young kids"" any more! All that from the last episode when they were visibly younger! Which makes me think that this second episode was the true first episode of the second season in the UK. Anyhoo, DCI Lewis does a great job (as a character) in a drunk club scene - just a brilliant rendition! Come the end, the twist is a little perverse, but makes sense. This episode also stars `Lofty' from Eastenders.

`In Deep'
A body is found in the water and after a slow build-up, the episode takes a family turn - as DCI Lewis' Polish male nanny teaches her son, Tom how to stand up for himself at school re: bullies - with a swift one-two to their guts and faces! He gets fired soon after, of course! As for the episode, not exciting, and they kind of give the killer away halfway through, unfortunately!

`Steady Eddie'
A robbery goes wrong when a young girl is involved in a hit and run. Now, the fact that the episode is named after one of the characters should give you the advance knowledge that he is not exactly, even though he's a cop, going to come out of this one clean! Anyway, that aside, this is definitely a grim tale, the killing within the first third of the episode out of the blue and devastating.

The Special Features of text interviews with both Caroline Quentin and Ian Kelsey are interesting, but I would have much rather seen a video interview with them both.

Blue Murder - Set 3
`Not A Matter of Life And Death'
Two brothers get into trouble outside a night club, with one of them eventually dying. A girl sees the mess, gets into a cab, and drives off - fast becoming the main suspect in the hunt for answers. After 20 minutes, and after something is said by one of the suspects, you suddenly know what's happened - and why! Another advancement here is that DCI Lewis arrives to the office talking on a blue tooth - which she NEVER uses ever again, in any episode, in any series! DI Mayne gets some personal, and welcomed good news too.

`Desperate Measures' `Crisis Management'
An incident on an Army base brings the squad onto unfamiliar ground. With the army hating the regular police, the police hating the Army, tempers flare, words are spat out, and the whole episode is taut. Suddenly, after the initial death, another officer is attacked, and then another is killed! The plot may well be a wee bit contrived, but it rolls at a beautiful pace and ends the very short three-episode season in style.

The Special Feature of a Behind-The-Scenes featurette (45 mins.) is hilarious! Absolutely brilliant as it shows not only how it all came together, but how they all truly seem to be in awe of each other! Revealing that the show is shown in 24 different countries, another interesting fact was that it gets mentioned it was a behind-the-scenes look at ""season four"" - and yet this is on Set 3 of the series! Again, somewhere along the line, the UK run re: episodes seem to have been sliced and diced differently over here for these sets. Oh, and just wait till you get to the part where Ian Kelsey just cannot remember to say the words `over the side` - take after take after take after take!

Blue Murder - Set 4
`Private Sins' - Part 1'
We begin with two new things off the bat - brand new, snazy opening credits and more episodes per season/set, but down from 1 hour 15 mins to just 45 mins. Sgt. Shap (played by Nicholas Murchie) is cleared of planting evidence at a crime scene, but is quickly knee-deep in a new mess! A bloody stabbing atop a car park brings out a secret in Sgt. Shap - one that he struggles to keep under control for most of the entire two-part episode! DCI Lewis' estranged husband, Pete now ""lives"" in Spain and so she only speaks to him via a few phone calls. The episode ends with a gruesome murder.

`Private Sins' - Part 2'
We go straight into the second part with Sgt. Shap now deep into the mess and having to semi-explain things to DI Mayne - who gives him one last chance to shape up or ship out. The team also gets a new African-American female in their squad, Cat - just slipped in, under the radar, no mention of Lisa having left ... or why! The ending of this whodunit comes complete with a real twist - and what a twist!

`Tooth & Nail'
A woman out running stumbles across a farm burning down, makes a call, and then is found dead (off screen)! The squad get to leave their concrete jungle and spread their legs on the dales and moors of Manchester ... and they LOVE it ... save for Sgt. Shap! As for who the killer is, well, it can be put together if you watch, listen and pick up on facial expressions, but I won't give it away! This is a really well played out, nicely scripted episode and comes complete with wonderful, expansive scenery.

`Having It All'
The death of a school Cheer Team coach leads us down a path of young love and hormones! That said, if you watch closely, the so-called ""chief suspect"" uses his eyes to give the game away early on, BUT it turns out to be a (slight) double bluff! Anyhoo, DCI Lewis' kids are remarkably older (again) and makes you realize (as DI Mayne has a new haircut also) that this must have been a ""future"" season in the UK!

`This Charming Man'
The story of the death of an up-and-coming lead singer of a Manchester rock band takes center stage here in grand style. The story may well plod along at times, but the acting is great, the story line feasible, and the whodunit conclusion; not to mention a wicked plot twist, is well worth waiting for!

`Inside'
What a way to end the series/set - although they didn`t know it, obviously! My goodness, wow, this was riveting from start to finish. A man, days away from getting an appeal on his murder sentence, is killed inside prison. DI Mayne goes in undercover to investigate, unbeknownst to his boss, DCI Lewis or the rest of the squad. This is a neat tale, well-acted, and is solid as a stand-alone episode. This is a Full Screen Presentation (1.33:1) enhanced for 16x9 TVs and comes with the noted Special Features of:

4311795,4,B004AV5H2G,"Caroline Quentin stars as Detective Chief Inspector Janine Lewis, a woman with more on her plate than most. The series takes place in Manchester, and some of the accents are most pronounced. DCI Lewis is in charge of mostly male detectives. In Series 4, there is a lovely female added who has no difficulty showing the males how good she is. the team loves and respects DCI. Lewis has a lot going for her but she is also a single mom of four children. She is pregnant in the first series when her husband leaves her for another woman. By Series Five, Lewis has learned how to deal, almost. She has a live-in nanny, but her two older children are teens, and the third chid, Thomas is always in trouble. The dad has moved to another country leaving Lewis to cope all on her own.

Her colleague, DI Richard Mayne, played by Ian Kelsey, is a friend and it is often suggested a romantic interest. He seems to be a comfort, and they are always joking. Lewis tells Mayne that he has the best a** in Manchester! Lewis can count on Mayne, and that is important in this series.

The stories are well written and filmed. Many times, I think I have figured out the plot, and then someone new or a missed clue is added to set me off track. Manchester, is a lovely city, gritty, full of crime, but, still, an involved and fascinating. It appears that Series Five was the last one of this series. I will miss the group, and most of all, DCI Lewis.

4311808,4,B004AV5H2G,"We have a vast amount of British Mysteries and Comedies.  Though we have our favorites (i.e. Frost, Lewis, Morse) we still like this series.  For the person who gave this a one start because as he/she describes the show with ""A dumpy matron leads a squad of less than inspiring officers on murder investigations."" then you are looking at a different set of DVD's.  After the initial bits of her husband cheating this ""frumpy"" matron is a woman who may be overweight, but in the rest of the stories has her hair done nicely bobbed, lipstick, decent makeup and dresses nicely for her age and occupation.  So I guess a frumpy matron means overweight.  Then this will explain one reason why we like it.  We are so fed up with the realty shows here and if there is a sitcom or police show you pretty much have the stars who are the ""pretty"" people and eventually they all begin to look alike. Perfect hair, perfect teeth etc. And then we have the shows with the Karashians, Paris Hilton and oh well you get the idea.  Shows like Columbo, Quincy and well most shows back when we had actors/actresses that actually looked like individuals probably could not make it on TV here now.  Oh yeah we have the rare exceptions but for the most part it is silly.  Our CSI shows show gals with long hair, plunging necklines, short skirts, makeup, with NO coverings for keeping evidence safe is just plain stupid.  So yep this show has a ""dumpy matron"" as a lead.  But that is one of the many things we like about the Brit shows, we can tell them apart from each other !  This show is mediumly interesting to us. But, it is still better than what the heck is on TV now.

  The stories are sometimes good, sometimes ok and sometimes really good.  The star does really decent police work and great police work too. We do not have a problem understanding the ""accents"" but do understand subtitles would be important to some.  We like the majority of the actors and most of the characters.  And since my husband and I are both retired law enforcement agents I will add we do like the thinking, time consuming, complicated, frustrating parts of law enforcement.  Deals with the boring, scary parts as well as cops who are evil as well as the good ones.  And if anyone thinks that doing any job much less law enforcement along with a family life is easy watch this show.  Some who review this think why can she do police work and not get her personal life together well... that is life and that is part of what makes it a really nice show.  Some say boring in their reviews ? As with many Brit shows the pacing is different than ours, another reason to like this show.  Hmmm well just can't find  a reason to dislike this show frankly. This is good police work, good characters.",1389225600,3,2754,4.4186507936507935

I liked the sequences where Jane is trying to juggle her home life, love life, and everything else.  The British are almost always good actors and actresses and are here. The stories are interesting enough but are hard to follow sometimes because there are no subtitles. In my old age I need subtitles, even when the show is in American English. I like real shows where the main characters are not all beautiful looking, just like in real life so I don't agree with some of the three star viewers here.",1377820800,,612,4.464285714285714

Detective Chief Inspector Lewis and her team are astute sleuths and they always get their man or woman but..........Janine's inability to manage even a few seconds of her private life was very puzzling.  Someone who has risen to senior status in the police force could do better.  Perhaps if her ""family"" were not such stereotypes she would have fared better.",1376956800,,516,4.873563218390805

Added to the stories, the family life of the chief  detective takes up a lot of time, particularly during the first few shows. The number two detective's life is also covered well. The last few shows are reduced from 100 minutes to about 56 minutes leaving less  time for family, but it  is not absent.
I also  like that  the cops don't need guns to do their job, although armed response teams are called in some times.

4311847,3,B004AV5H2G,"This is an OK show and done well, but everything about it is very sensible; the cops are down to earth, uninteresting, average looking and not especially likeable. The murder stories also always make sense, with no twists or bizarre motives or eccentric characters.
The person with the strongest motive is always the killer, so no great mystery to the stories. So over all it is a little dull.",1345593600,5,393,4.7101449275362315
4311848,4,B004AV5H2G,"This is a solid British police procedural drama, set in the north of England. Caroline Quentin plays Janine Lewis, a DCI who manages a mainly male police unit and a chaotic family. There are obvious parallels to 'Prime Suspect', but with the lead character made much more warm and caring than the character played by Helen Mirren.

The stories are fairly standard stuff, with Lewis and her crew building a picture of the crime and possible suspects. The acting is first-rate, as usual with British crime series, with interesting supporting characters revolving around Quentin. It's a little more hard-boiled than 'Midsomer Murders', less intellectual than 'Morse' and less gloomy than 'Frost'; right down the middle, in fact.

I'd have liked to see Quentin's talent for humor exploited more and I find her family issues to be a bit of a distraction, though they do become more relevant as the episodes go on. Ian Kelsey makes an appealing sidekick/romantic interest.

There is one major flaw with the packaging of this set; NOWHERE is there an episode listing, either on the box, the individual jewel cases or the DVDs themselves. If you can't remember the number of the episode you watched last (such as volume two, episode three), you just have to put the DVDs in and try and find the next one, which is time-wasting and unnecessary. I like to spread out my viewing of a series and a couple of weeks on I can't remember which number I'm up to. Maybe I'm just old!

Well worth watching for lovers of British drama. I'm a little mystified by those who can't understand the dialog; this is far from the most difficult show to understand. Those who have problems, don't buy 'Minder'!",1329436800,12,1681,4.786206896551724
4311849,4,B004AV5H2G,"This is a well written series. The episodes are original and the characters are interesting with a few of the usual types seen in crime dramas.

4311851,4,B004AV5H2G,"I watched the first two seasons (aka: 'series' in the UK) on Netflix instant watch, got hooked and requested the complete set for Christmas. One thing that I found annoying with the DVD set was neither the DVD's nor the cases listed the episode names. I knew the name of the episode which should be first in season/series 3 but when I looked for it on the DVD's, I discovered the episodes on sets 2 and 4 are out of order from the original UK air dates. This may or may not matter to the overall ongoing relationships in the shows, so might cause confusion. I intend to watch them in the order they originally aired and will report back as to whether or not it makes any difference.

4311852,5,B004AV5H2G,"""Blue Murder: The Complete Collection,"" now comes to us as a nice fat box set. The Blue Murder pilot debuted in the U.K. in May 2003, on ITV (Independent Television Stations); where it drew almost 8.4 million viewers, a number seldom heard of there. The series, which was created by midlands author Cath Staincliffe, has continued to do very well in the U.K., consistently ranking number one in its time slot. It has, unfortunately for us, never aired on broadcast TV here: the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" calls it ""The best British mystery you haven't seen...."" So, luckily, we can at least get it on DVD. Even more luckily, Acorn Media has given us subtitles, as this production is located in Manchester. And the performers have been encouraged to trot out their local patois. Which, while the Manchester accent and usage fall interestingly on the ear, giving us pleasurable local flavor, we're not all that familiar with them this side of the pond.

To begin with Manchester, it sure has cleaned up very well: centuries of black industrial grime gone, revealing a beautiful city, with interesting, varied architecture. And a diverse, varied population: the M.E. in the current series is surely a descendant of the Indian subcontinent.

The series stars the talented, award-winning actress Caroline Quentin, who was once best known as a comic actor (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Creek-Season-One/dp/B000GYI3MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Creek - Season One</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behaving-Badly-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000KGH0A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Series</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Begins-Series-1/dp/B0012EBV60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Begins - Series 1</a>); as Detective Constable Inspector Janine Lewis, a hard-driving, high-profile contemporary detective and single mother of four, who must always try to balance the demands of family, where she's just ""Mum,"" and career, where she's ""Boss."" In her job, she faces drive-by shootings, abducted children, and police corruption; at home, the, praises be, no longer all that young, nor all that slim, detective interviews nanny candidates, and attempts to comfort her bullied young son. In this substantial entertainment, Quentin shows solid dramatic chops, as well as her comedic gifts.

Mind you, Quentin doesn't play Janine Lewis as another Jane Tennyson, Helen Mirren's tough female cop; but, then, she's not intended to: she'll never be as slim, or as long-legged as Mirren. However, the series was created, and the first episodes written, by Cath Staincliffe, who has said she's particularly interested in the problems of women, single mothers, trying to be good mothers to demanding families while holding down demanding jobs. Staincliffe is a Northern/Midlands British girl, through and through: she was born in Bradford, graduated from Birmingham University, and, as a graduate, moved to Manchester to start a job. She has published several mysteries, including a series about another Manchester single mum/private investigator. Her work has been nominated for awards, and is highly praised by her hometown critics. Val McDermid, Manchester's reigning crime queen, said, Staincliffe ""has her finger on the pulse of her city and that rare ability to write about love motherhood and friendship without sentimentality, a must,"" in ""The Manchester Evening News."" Another local reviewer said her work was ""compassionate, exciting, and down-to-earth. Infused, also with that rare and precious ingredient: true feeling."" ""The Yorkshire Post"" said her [Staincliffe's] work was ""warm, compassionate and engrossing."" So; down to earth, and without sentimentality, are always necessities in the industrial midlands, and the show is very popular with its homies, surely a good sign.

Furthermore, the production has been filmed with a liberal hand, no shortage of cars and people around. The dramas are flavorful and engrossing, the mysteries gritty and challenging, frequently told from the female point of view. The cop shop scenes are lively, leavened with sly humor, and interspersed with Janine's family business. In fact, as everybody grows into their parts, I'm just getting to like this series better and better.

If you like a substantial, but lighter, female-headed, female-oriented mystery, with a domestic angle, and a sly streak of comedy, check it out.",1325721600,,5948,6.075
