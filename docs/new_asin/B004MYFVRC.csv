Should probably be considered for the Grammies, or the Emmys, or the Oscars; maybe the Razzies? It could probably be considered for several other things, as well. It is an epicurean delight and I will never look at pizza dough the same way I used to.... Made me wish more movies were made in my neighborhood; I've been an extra in a few. The closest movie to be filmed near here was the old Bill Murray comedy, ""Groundhog Day"". Elvis fans might find this flick of interest, as may fans of old 'Tricky Dick' Nixon. Some of the dialogue was cute, in that references came right out of old rock 'n' roll songs. And some characters were familiar: Peggy Sue, anyone? I ordered a second copy and had it sent to my sister---even though I'm not mad at her for anything; she's an Elvis groupie from waaaaay back. Now, I think I'll watch and see if they decide to release the soundtrack; it's infectious, kinda like the living dead (zombies) themselves. That reminds me, today is Sunday and that means ""The Walking Dead"" is/are on TV tonight; I'd better get my chores done, so I don't miss that; hell, it's already down to its last couple of episodes for this so-called 'season'.",1364083200,,1326,4.622881355932203
