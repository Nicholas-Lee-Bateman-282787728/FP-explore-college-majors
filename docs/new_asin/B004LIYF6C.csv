8434430,5,B004LIYF6C,"I first started watching ""Sorakake Shouju"" as a way to fill time between seasons of ""Hetalia,"" but it only took one episode to get me hooked.  It's certainly a mix of various anime genres, but I found the mix a charming one, and lots of fun to boot.  If you're looking for the grim, serious type of anime, don't look here; but if you like slapstick arguments, puns, and comedic misunderstanding, well, there's lots to enjoy. In fact, despite the many ""nudge-nudge"" moments for the grownups in the audience, the structure of the show seems to be oriented toward older kids...but it is done very well.
  And the look of the series is jaw-dropping.  Somebody obviously did his astronomy homework in designing the Kirkwood colony; the ""freeway"" even has an inverted lane, which could only be possible in space.  And I personally found that the traditional animation mixed well with the CGI.
  However, the best thing about ""Sorakake"" is the music.  There's a very jazz-prog vibe to this show's incidental music, as opposed to the bouncy-pop opening and ending songs; and if you listen closely, you can hear at least one ""borrowed"" prog riff: a slightly-altered version of the final synth flourishes from Emerson, Lake and Palmer's ""The Endless Enigma."" I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but it's fun to listen for.
  This volume is the only one besides the last one with a definitive, triumphant ending, so if you buy this vid, be aware that volumes 2 and 3 of this series will expose you to what I call ""cliffhanger frustration.""  I found it easier to buy them all as a group, and if you really want to get the full effect of this charming, fun anime, you might want to do likewise.",1344988800,5,1690,4.653198653198653
8434431,3,B004LIYF6C,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Space is a curious bit of anime brain candy. It has a little bit of everything thrown in: mechas, school life, teen angst, fan service, high tech, moe, slapstick, plot and the like. The scifi setting fills the visual landscape and the renderings are actually rather entertaining, but the show never really takes itself seriously enough - i can quite tell yet if it is meant as pure . There isn't anything particularly special about the series, but given that it is scifi but not too technical (like Planetes), action packed without being one long fight scene (like Bleach), fan servicey without being ecchi (though the female pilots all seem to wear cleavage suits), and has enough story to progress without being heavy, the series makes for an enjoyable light watch. It certainly isn't an anime classic, but if you are into any of the above genres and want a light mental snack, this isn't a bad choice.

Don't be confused by the title, The Girl Who Leapt Through Space bears utterly no resemblance to the similarly English named Girl Who Leapt Through Time.",1308355200,15,1086,4.746031746031746
