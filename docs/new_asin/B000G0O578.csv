8128236,5,B000G0O578,"All the titles in this Andersen series from Europe are excellent in quality and content. I think we bought them all: The Tin soldier, The Snow princess, the Nightingale, the little Mermaid..
My son, age 3, likes them all and so do I.
Spanish accent from Spain.",1193011200,,260,4.553191489361702
8128237,5,B000G0O578,"We have already 2 of the HC Andersen collection -El Patito Feo and El Soldadito de plomo- and they are both of excellent quality in every aspect. It's an European co-production so the Spanish accent is from Spain - perfect for us since that's what I'm teaching my son. The stories are safe for a pre-schooler but entertaining enough for an older child too. I've just bought ""La princesa de las Nieves"" and ""El Ruisenor"" from the same collection and can't wait until they get here!

Great buy in my opinion.",1178755200,6,506,4.56043956043956
