I don't know if this was supposed to be a horror movie with some comedy elements or a comedy with horror elements but all I know is I was on the floor laughing. Just look at the in jokes and dialogue ""Free at last , free at last , thank God almighty free at last"" should be enough to get the NAACP protesting. ""A friend with weed is a friend indeed""..HILLARIOUS..don't watch films like this wanting a brilliant filmmaking achievement , watch it when you need a good chuckle..and if you have a good sense of humor",1018310400,,604,4.401785714285714
