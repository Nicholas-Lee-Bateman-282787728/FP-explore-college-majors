2961378,5,B000W3Q5NG,"If You are like me and had given up on ever understanding modes I implore you to get this dvd. Here's the email I sent to Desi:

Desi,
 I just finished watching your DVD on Modal Theory and just have to say I was amazed! I have looked around the Internet many times for information on modes and never saw anything that didn't just confuse me. I finally gave up thinking ""well I can probably get along OK without knowing this stuff"", but it still bothered me. The closest I got to an explanation was at a barbeque where someone who I knew played the piano told me that it depends on what chords that you play the scale over that gives the mode sound. I thought huh?

 In all of the explanations that I saw on forums they talked about starting on the 2nd, 3rd etc note of the major scale and I just didn't see how this would do anything. How could playing the exact same notes, but just starting on a different note of the scale possibly change anything? Well as you stated on the video, that is just one of the misconceptions of modes - the note you start on doesn't matter. No wonder I was confused!

 When I saw your DVD I thought OK maybe I'll give it one more shot. I have to say as I watched the video the feeling that I had inside as I realized ""hey I'm getting this now!"" was incredible. If I wasn't 100% sure of something, sure enough by the time you were finished my question had been answered.

 You did an incredible job of thoroughly covering this subject. Your examples really reinforced the concepts. I especially liked the last part where you just played the low E string and then explained what the options were. This really cemented in my brain the modal concepts.

 I actually think I could explain modes to someone now! As someone who was totally confused about the subject before seeing your video, I think that's the highest complement that a teacher could have. You're truly a great instructor.

I just wanted to say thank you.

Richard

PS - By the`way Desi states that you should have a good understanding of the major scale, chord progressions, and the chord numbering system. Don't let this scare you away. I would say that if you just have a passing awareness of these concepts you will still understand what he teaches on this video. I can't remember the last time I saw an indtructional video and had that aha! moment.",1190678400,3,2352,4.36697247706422
2961379,5,B000W3Q5NG,"I bought a few books on guitar modes but it never really ""clicked"" in my head.  Watching him explain the modes and give real world examples of songs made it come together for me.  After watching the DVD I immediately grabbed my guitar and started composing using the modes.

Having downloaded Desi Serna's Guitar excellent theory books, I was curious to discover whether there was a benefit to be obtained from his video on modes - a topic with which I have struggled for years. Desi's bold and provocative statement, about all other instruction being incorrect, got my immediate attention because I hoped his approach would prove the effective one for me.
It does, indeed, transpire that most of the information upon which I had previously attempted to base my playing was, if not inaccurate, certainly incomplete and fragmented.
This video does not disappoint; most of all because I did not feel that I was attempting to learn rocket science 101. It provides a nice balance of information and practical demonstration. The selected, familiar musical phrases, provided as examples, illustrate and reinforce the teacher's comments effectively - as well as being pleasurable listening. As Desi points out, this is part of a sequential course and certain knowledge ( e.g. scale intervals, chord structure and sequences) is prerequisite, in order to gain from the video. I confess to being a little 'theory-rusty' but the activity of playing short phrases along with the video helped to re-polish my major scale skill and pattern recognition.
I have been playing long enough to have been approaching the dreaded plateau; this video has provided a fresh impetus and the will to experiment again in my soloing attempts.",1371168000,,1729,5.865079365079365

2961384,4,B000W3Q5NG,"This is a 2 1/2 hr lesson on modes and requires your prior knowledge of scales, major, minor and pentatonic as well as chords, and chord progressions by numbers. Desi does a great job describing the use of the modes and interactions with the scales but be aware if you think this is a step by step Tab laced lesson it isn't. I got a little bored in the middle of the video where he spends at least 1/2 an hour playing bits of songs as examples to the corresponding modes and turned it off (- 1 star). I'm glad I came back to finish the video because it resumes with an excellent lesson on the relationship of how the scales change in different chord progressions. I consider myself a low intermediate level hack, so I did have to rewatch certain sections a few times to get the point but at the end wound up with a few pages of notes. I now understand not only which scales to play but also understand why they work.

Comparatively, I've owned Guitar 411, a video that supposedly demystified modal scales but left me more confused then before I watched it. Desi's knows how to teach, and relays his knowledge in a clear and direct manner. I've seen alot of instructional videos for guitar, Desi is at the top of the list for instructors with the likes of Keith Wyatt and Steve Krenz. I'd recommend renting it, as its not really a video to play along with, It's modal theory, so grab a pen and notebook, you'll need it. I'd also recommend his video on Chord progression by the numbers.",1353715200,2,1484,4.35740072202166

2961387,5,B000W3Q5NG,"This DVD nails the modal concept and is down to earth enough to put it in terms that could be easily understood.  Desi 'gets it', teaches in a way that is non-threatening, communicates really well, and re-inforces the concepts over and over again.

A couple bugs where he said something different than he played (although he corrects it with text on screen) but over all the ONLY modal instruction you will ever need!!  After watching this video twice I was ripping Phygian and Mixolydian leads (among others with ease!!).

Only thing I would add to this video would be a KEY/CHORD chart to show the degrees of the chords and applications of modes on top of the related chords.  I use one when practicing to refer to chords in key and to figure out what mode to put over what progressions.  But you can download one from the internet to satisfy this.

Great DVD!!  Go Desi!!

I have looked around the Internet many times for information on modes and never saw anything that didn't just confuse me. I finally gave up thinking ""well I can probably get along OK without knowing this stuff"", but it still bothered me. The closest I got to an explanation was at a barbeque where someone who I knew played the piano told me that it depends on what chords that you play the scale over that gives the mode sound. I thought huh?

 In all of the explanations that I saw on forums they talked about starting on the 2nd, 3rd etc note of the major scale and I just didn't see how this would do anything. How could playing the exact same notes, but just starting on a different note of the scale possibly change anything? Well as you stated on the video, that is just one of the misconceptions of modes - the note you start on doesn't matter. No wonder I was confused!

 When I saw your DVD I thought OK maybe I'll give it one more shot. I have to say as I watched the video the feeling that I had inside as I realized ""hey I'm getting this now!"" was incredible. If I wasn't 100% sure of something, sure enough by the time you were finished my question had been answered.

 You did an incredible job of thoroughly covering this subject. Your examples really reinforced the concepts. I especially liked the last part where you just played the low E string and then explained what the options were. This really cemented in my brain the modal concepts.

 I actually think I could explain modes to someone now! As someone who was totally confused about the subject before seeing your video, I think that's the highest complement that a teacher could have. You're truly a great instructor.

I just wanted to say thank you.

PS - By the`way Desi states that you should have a good understanding of the major scale, chord progressions, and the chord numbering system. Don't let this scare you away. I would say that if you just have a passing awareness of these concepts you will still understand what he teaches on this video. I can't remember the last time I saw an indtructional video and had that aha! moment.",1190678400,3,2352,4.36697247706422

Watching him explain the modes and give real world examples of songs made it come together for me.  After watching the DVD I immediately grabbed my guitar and started composing using the modes.  If you know the major scale and its chords, then you know the foundation on using modes.  It was an ""ah - hah"" moment.  Thanks!!!",1397692800,,404,4.405405405405405

Having downloaded Desi Serna's Guitar excellent theory books, I was curious to discover whether there was a benefit to be obtained from his video on modes - a topic with which I have struggled for years. Desi's bold and provocative statement, about all other instruction being incorrect, got my immediate attention because I hoped his approach would prove the effective one for me.
It does, indeed, transpire that most of the information upon which I had previously attempted to base my playing was, if not inaccurate, certainly incomplete and fragmented.
This video does not disappoint; most of all because I did not feel that I was attempting to learn rocket science 101. It provides a nice balance of information and practical demonstration. The selected, familiar musical phrases, provided as examples, illustrate and reinforce the teacher's comments effectively - as well as being pleasurable listening. As Desi points out, this is part of a sequential course and certain knowledge ( e.g. scale intervals, chord structure and sequences) is prerequisite, in order to gain from the video. I confess to being a little 'theory-rusty' but the activity of playing short phrases along with the video helped to re-polish my major scale skill and pattern recognition.
I have been playing long enough to have been approaching the dreaded plateau; this video has provided a fresh impetus and the will to experiment again in my soloing attempts.",1371168000,,1729,5.865079365079365

3195881,4,B000W3Q5NG,"This is a 2 1/2 hr lesson on modes and requires your prior knowledge of scales, major, minor and pentatonic as well as chords, and chord progressions by numbers. Desi does a great job describing the use of the modes and interactions with the scales but be aware if you think this is a step by step Tab laced lesson it isn't. I got a little bored in the middle of the video where he spends at least 1/2 an hour playing bits of songs as examples to the corresponding modes and turned it off (- 1 star). I'm glad I came back to finish the video because it resumes with an excellent lesson on the relationship of how the scales change in different chord progressions. I consider myself a low intermediate level hack, so I did have to rewatch certain sections a few times to get the point but at the end wound up with a few pages of notes. I now understand not only which scales to play but also understand why they work.

Comparatively, I've owned Guitar 411, a video that supposedly demystified modal scales but left me more confused then before I watched it. Desi's knows how to teach, and relays his knowledge in a clear and direct manner. I've seen alot of instructional videos for guitar, Desi is at the top of the list for instructors with the likes of Keith Wyatt and Steve Krenz. I'd recommend renting it, as its not really a video to play along with, It's modal theory, so grab a pen and notebook, you'll need it. I'd also recommend his video on Chord progression by the numbers.",1353715200,2,1484,4.35740072202166
3195882,5,B000W3Q5NG,"I'm a bit ticked off. For the past 30 years, no one has been able to properly explain modes to me. This video has cleared the whole thing up. I would advise that you keep a note pad with you when you watch it. I'm going to go through it again, because there is a lot to take in. Desi is an excellent teacher. I would recommend all of his videos. I just wish I had them many years ago. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!",1353283200,3,422,3.752808988764045

3195884,5,B000W3Q5NG,"This DVD nails the modal concept and is down to earth enough to put it in terms that could be easily understood.  Desi 'gets it', teaches in a way that is non-threatening, communicates really well, and re-inforces the concepts over and over again.

A couple bugs where he said something different than he played (although he corrects it with text on screen) but over all the ONLY modal instruction you will ever need!!  After watching this video twice I was ripping Phygian and Mixolydian leads (among others with ease!!).

Only thing I would add to this video would be a KEY/CHORD chart to show the degrees of the chords and applications of modes on top of the related chords.  I use one when practicing to refer to chords in key and to figure out what mode to put over what progressions.  But you can download one from the internet to satisfy this.

Great DVD!!  Go Desi!!

Within the first 30 minutes of working through this DVD, I experienced that ""AH HA!"" moment, and the subject of modes was no longer a huge mystery.  Seriously. You will understand how to use modes quickly if you work through this DVD.

 I just recieved this DVD. I have been playing guitar professionally for over 30 years and I must say after viewing it, that it has to be the best video lesson on the modes that I have ever seen (and I own several including the one by Frank Gambale which was very good also, but not as clear).

He also reveals a very simple ""secret"" about modes that completely de-mystifies the subject and makes you realize immediately why you were so confused.

8221119,5,B000W3Q5NG,"The best presentation of modes I've seen, hands down.

I think it is fair to say the historical approach to teaching modes is at best, confusing to many or most students. If that was not true, then everyone would understand modes -- But they don't! I've even heard college educated music majors tell me that they never really understood modes that well, or that they never found a practical use for them.  I've heard more than one very talented professional musician say they almost quit their college music major because they didn't think they could learn modes. To me this says...there must be a better way to teach it. I think it is because the historical approach is to start by describing all the theoretical construct and it becomes a confusing mess where most students get lost before they ever get to the point. Once they start to get the point, they are taken down a rabbit hole of over-analysis before the basic concepts are firmed up. I'm sure there are those who will say that isn't the case. But again, if the traditional approach is the best one, then why do so many people struggle with the concept of modes?

Serna approaches it from the opposite perspective. I very quickly understood the modal concept and was able to hear it, relate it to modern songs, and immediately comprehend how modes can be used in composition of music. It also answered questions I had about why key signatures in songs sometimes didn't seem to match what I thought the key was based on the chords....and more. Serna made modes accessible to me. This opens the door to then reconsidering the traditional learning method and perhaps understanding modes on a deeper level in light of that. But if you start here the path will be easier.

I don't think the DVD is available anymore...visit Desi Serna's website and I think you can buy the content online.

I highly recommend his materials. They are well written, helpful, and practical for the non professional musician.
