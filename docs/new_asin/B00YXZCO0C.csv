8719331,5,B00YXZCO0C,"This is one of the best romantic movies for the ages---having said that, it is NOT available in the US for our DVD format---ask for this to change immediately! There is a MUCH BETTER movie called ""Biri Gyaru""---with this same actress, wonderfully portrayed a girl/young woman that has lived in a ""male dominated"" world in Japan---we need to clamor for better quality Japanese movies that are meaningful as well as perfectly subtitled in English (for my wife)! I actually saw these movies on a flight to Tokyo on Delta Air---with English subtitles---why is it that we can't even get these on DVD's formatted for the US with subtitles?
