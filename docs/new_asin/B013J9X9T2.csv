8727974,5,B013J9X9T2,"This classy series might better be titled ""Weisensee machinations"" and like all enjoyable boxsets, it's easy to binge on 3 or 4 episodes at once. Well-written, well-acted and well-produced and all 3 seasons of my copies at least had full English subtitles that were large and clear (other reviewers seem to have had issues with absent subs for some reason). If you like quality European drama, you'll like this (plaudits to all involved!). [More like this please Amazon with English subs!]",1492214400,,489,5.049382716049383

8727977,5,B013J9X9T2,"Excellent mini series but season 3 does not have English subtitles, which I knew but need to improve my German anyway.

The series shows, in my opinion, a realistic representation of life in East Berlin in the 1980's.  Loved it!",1469232000,,228,4.675
