4519428,5,B00514JK4M,"Thank goodness this ""Thunder On The Hill"" is available now.  This is an excellent film.  Though set in the English countryside the film is made entirely on sets indoors.  But the effect is convincing, not contrived, and made deliberately strange and compelling to reflect the theme and emotions of the film.  It is a mystery you will not until the very end be able to guess ""who done it"".  All the actors, most now deceased, are incredibly good.  I recommend this film and urge viewers to agitate Universal, WB, etc. to release good copies of other classics from the bygone Hollywood era.",1320969600,16,588,4.715686274509804

8452286,5,B00514JK4M,Thunder on the Hill. A Universal movie from 1962 a thriller about a nun convent that is perched on a mountain and during the floods in England it was the safest place to go until the water goes down but all kinds of people end up there including a murderess  And nun Claudette Colbert plays detective to try to help this woman. Little do they know that the real murderer is also held up in the convent and wants to make sure he or she is never caught so they may have to do away with anybody that knows or suspects. It's a very good movie I bought it from Amazon. Not cheap but maybe you can get a good deal with the great people at Amazon.com,1496707200,,643,4.062992125984252

8452288,4,B00514JK4M,"Claudette Colbert plays Sister Mary, a nun who is convinced of a convicted murderer's innocence (Ann Blyth).

The film reminded me of an Agatha Christie mystery where everyone is trapped in a secluded area including the real murderer. It's a suspenseful film with some wonderful moments including Valerie Carn's expression of innocence to Sister Mary. There's also the terrible reaction of the villagers and the Mother Superior who turn against Sister Mary for believing in the murderess' innocence.

In an interview, Douglas Sirk said he was unhappy with the film because of the producer's interference with the script. He wanted to downplay the religious elements and focus only on the murder mystery.

This is an entertaining film with moving performances by Claudette Colbert and Ann Blyth.",1492128000,,794,5.285714285714286

8452291,5,B00514JK4M,"A nun (Claudette Colbert) races against time to prove the innocence of a convicted murderess (Ann Blyth) who is being escorted to prison for a date with the gallows.

This movie pairs two great actresses, it really is great to see Claudette Colbert on the silver screen once again.  The black and white genre is a marvelous readdition to this movie.",1392854400,3,349,4.704918032786885
8452292,5,B00514JK4M,"Claudette Colbert plays a nun who attempts to prove the innocence of a convicted murderess (Ann Blythe) who is scheduled to be executed.  The story is not brilliantly constructed, but Colbert shines as a nun who, despite taking vows of obedience, cannot stop herself from trying to stop a miscarriage of justice.
The copy of the dvd is really excellent. I played it on my dvd blue ray player and was astounded to see how really well remastered it is!!!
  I'm  a fan of Claudette Colbert, and she never disappoints me. Love the woman madly!!!",1354665600,6,541,4.663157894736842
8452293,4,B00514JK4M,"Well acted, unusual movie (a characteristic of great directors and artists who always show us something new). It is set in a convent that is also a hospital. The mystery is solved by a nun who doesn't seem to have the skills of a detective. The story is well worked out but I think it suffers a little from cheap and small sets that restrict the actors' movements. Early in his Hollywood career Sirk seems to have been lumbered with such sets. The same can be said for this great director's other early movies like ""Summer Storm"" and ""Hitler's Madman"". It is interesting that like ""Lured"" it is set in England. It convinces like ""Lured"" because it has a strong story to tell.",1353196800,2,675,4.495934959349594
8452294,4,B00514JK4M,"One of claudette colbert's last films Thunder on the hill with hollywood filling in for london. We once again find a condemned woman coming to a convent for sanctuary and help in finding the one person who can help her. The story has a kind of medieval air to it,the isolated convent hospital,with all the nurses clergy type people,and the person coming here for help,rather than anywhere else the conscience of the community. When watching it you think agatha christie had something to do with it,but its not based on her works,and the atmosphere of the film,the constant thunder and rain adds atmosphere to the piece..Of course the man who can help clear this woman is found,her lover,but he seems quite normal and although he loves the accused,is unsure of her innocence. In the end there is a letter,and the real accused the doctor is found with an ending in a bell tower reminiscent of vertigo(although hitchcock's is staged much better).Colbert gained fame in hollywood early when talkies first came out and had many memorable roles it happenned one night(1934)the egg and i(1948) among others. At this point in her career after being a star for many years her screen career ended...and its often difficult to find or view her work years ago except for the hits,but i enjoyed her work though i haven't seen that many. An interesting original work! Father dowling tv show came later...",1333238400,2,1390,4.8691983122362865
8452295,4,B00514JK4M,"One of Colbert's best!!  She really hit her stride from the late forties thru early fifties; from ""Since You Went Away"" to ""Thunder on The Hill"", she gave her best performances. The problem?  It's almost impossible to find this film anywhere!!  The compilations out there for her work in the thirties suck.  Her MGM films of the early forties suck.  She hit her stride @ her ""home"" studio, Paramount, in the mid-to-late forties & her loan-out work while there. So, buy it while you can!! The only drawback in this film is Ann Blyth!!  What a lousy dramatic actress.  Reminds me of Lynn Bari; all the over-emoting when they know they're in WAY over their heads!!",1324684800,4,661,4.646551724137931
