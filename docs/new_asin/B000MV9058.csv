8172826,1,B000MV9058,"There are some good and challenging moves here - especially in the Stability Ball section but I find Mindy Mylrea so annoying I won't be doing this DVD again. Why do presenters think that a buyer will only be doing the DVD once? They forget that all their silly comments and over-the-top manner will get VERY annoying VERY quickly?
As I said previously there are some good moves here but I will be will be taking them and doing them solo.",1482451200,,438,4.419753086419753
8172827,5,B000MV9058,"Mindy Mylrea is a wonderful trainer.  She is very energetic and encouraging without being too pushy.  I watched the whole DVD first and I thought I would be able to do the three sections, but when I tried I was able to do only one.  So if you are young and energetic you are going to really enjoy this ""All about ABS DVD. Hopefuly some day in the near future I'll be able to do the whole program.",1313884800,,396,4.051282051282051
8172828,4,B000MV9058,"A  55 minute workout with 4 sections: MED BALL, STABILITY BALL, BODY WEIGHT and bonus GLIDING DISCS. This workout part of a 3 DVD series of 'ALL ABOUT' is recommended for the intermediate-advanced.  Mindy shows you options at all levels. Transitions flow easily, slightly changing limbs to work more or supporting muscles.

MED BALL: functional moves for ab & back. Fun, creative moves done both standing and sitting.  Challenge move doing push-ups with both hands on med ball.
STABILITY BALL: After a brief warm-up, you'll perform twists and bends, and was the most challenging for me, even with a beginner modifier!  First move is a plank on the ball, then you do leg lifts.  You'll work all over the ball: supine, prone, doing pikes, upper body lifts.  Fav move: while supine, hand off the ball from feet to hands.
BODY WEIGHT: You'll do classic Pilates moves such as the teaser.  My fav move: on all fours, with one leg out, then into push-ups.
GLIDING: I enjoy this type of exercise, but it's quite an advanced technique, maybe because my body isn't familiar with the push and pull motion. Substitutions can include paper plates which work good on ceramic floors, or cotton cloth on wooden floors.",1274313600,,1202,4.829268292682927
8172829,4,B000MV9058,"I love Mindy.  She just seems like one of those fitness instructors that is very ""real"". She's not like the usual ""happy happy"" in your face type of instructors that starts to get annoying after a while.  Just as the previous reviewer stated this DVD is composed of several mini workouts.  I bought if for the medicine ball abs routine.  I wanted something different.  There really is something for everyone in this DVD.  All levels are addressed.  Mindy kicks some major butt performing some really advanced moves but I love that all levels are represented so you can grow with the DVD.  Would I reccomend it, yes.  I also would reccomend if you don't own them already any of her gliding disc DVD's.  There is a segment in this DVD using the gliding discs, you just feel your core working all over the place when you use them.",1218844800,4,827,4.527027027027027
8172830,5,B000MV9058,"I am a personal trainer so I am a fairly advanced exerciser.  I thought this DVD was well-done.  It gives you 3 different mediums of working out the abs.  I thought the body weight section was the easiest, the stability ball section in the middle and the medicine ball segment the most challenging.  All of the sections were pretty creative and challenging.  The dvd is well-cued and easy to follow and understand.  I would definitely recommend it.",1173312000,4,448,4.753246753246753
