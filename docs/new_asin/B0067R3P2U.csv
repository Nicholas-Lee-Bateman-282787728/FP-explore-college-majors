8494438,1,B0067R3P2U,"Mike (Antoine John Mottet) is an ex-Vietnam vet with flashbacks who moonlights as a vigilante. He happens to be in the right place at the right time along with a sound track that sounds similar to ""Shaft."" What is noticeably bad about the film is the sound quality and sound editing. The sound doesn't always match up with the punches and when it does, it sounds like a foreign film. The outdoor sound was simply horrible.

The film is campy and if anything shows war vets in the worse light possible by making them into psychotic killers, albeit, for good. Might be worth a view for the camp value.
