With such collaborators as Mark Fischer, Jean Paul Gaultier, her fellowship Laurent Boutonnat, and many others... You are sure to spend a Great moment by watching this performance. In France during march it was even released as a movie (in many theaters) for the unlucky ones who did not have the opportunity to buy their tickets. (sold out in a few hours a year before the stage, as usual with Mylne)
30 millions euros budget, 30 trucks, she-robots, 3d screen effects, duets with Moby and Gary Jules... 30 HD movie cameras...
Don t miss it!
Have a Great show with France's greatest performer, our French Madonna.

8649086,5,B00J9KHZ9Q,"I was a little worried because Amazon shipment with IPARCEL was not trackeable, and if this package were lost Amazon CAN'T REPLACE THEM.....they does not  have it anymore.

This dual blu ray digipack deluxe version its not even available in France , not even  big surfaces like FNAC have it....SOLD OUT !!! only available the cheaper (25 EUR) single disc version....I saw a copy in Amazon France marketplace for EUR 95 !!!!

Fortunately the discs finally arrived home and,  if I have to say it in a word  what a Mylene show is, ... is INVESTMENT !!!!  certainly this lady honesty is heartbreaking....she  allways uses  her fans hard earned money not to buy private islands or luxury yachts for her ego , (like many of her counterparts) but to deliver THE BEST POSSIBLE SHOW ON EARTH ....this stravagant performance has a budget of  45 million  (30 M EUR) this RECORD BREAKING show cost  can be seen everywhere, the amazing stages, the best lights, the musicians, the best graphic 2D / 3D artists in the industry, Jean Paul Gaultier dresses, a complete luxury....

As the former ""LIVE AT STADE DE FRANCE""  this work technically is a masterpiece, with REAL  full HD  (real 1080p)  pristine images, absolute black levels,  marvellous sound, absolutely perfect cristal clear surround sound and ambience, in this regard Mylene uses the best of the best and results are logically splendid. REFERENCE QUALITY.

And the show itself is wonderful, only Stade de France 2010 show could be on a pair, compared to Mylene performances  for example last Madonna show (shooted here in 2008 in Argentina my country) feels like a  rudimentary High School musical !!!! , you will see incredibly visuals, not fake but real industrial grade robots dancing , lasers and LED screens everywhere, nothing compares to this....

Some people say Mrs Farmer looks a little tired with less energy that in Stade de France show, yes maybe she is a little more static than usual, she is a lady in her fifties like Madonna  but still looks stunning, probably she is older and moves less than 3 years ago, but take into account the front stage is so complex that even the dancers have limited area s to dance and move  as lights, wires, etc. are spread everywhere.

Just a warning, the disc is mislabelled zone 0 (ALL) but is PAL (even if you use HDMI digital video) so an american player did not read it, you will need a european player like my Pioneer BDPLX55 or a multiregion PAL / NTSC player otherwise you will have a nice paperweight.

 Definitively a MUST HAVE blu ray and probably the best of 2014 by a wide margin !!! Is THAT good !!!!

100% RECOMMENDED !!!!!",1407974400,7,2633,4.702407002188184
8649087,4,B00J9KHZ9Q,"I purchased this Blu-Ray on Amazon France and I just got it yesterday and watched it immediately.

There are some excellent reviews already written here with very valuable information, so I only want to add to them that although on the Blu-Ray's case it reads that it is Area ""B"" (Europe) on the Discs it reads ""Tous les zones""(All Zones = 0). The good news is that, in effect, the Blu Rays are PAL-0, so if you have a Blu Ray player that reads PAL Blu Rays you will be able to watch it. If it had been Area B, it wouldn't have been possible.

As for the concert, the image and sound quality is excellent, and the mise-en-scene is impeccable, so if you are a Mylene Farmer fan it is a must-have. I have to say though, that upon watching it I felt that it wasn't up to the artistic quality of Mylene's previous concerts: ""Stade de France"" (promoting the ""Point de Suture"" album) and ""Avant Que L'Ombre"" (which promoted the same title album). I felt that Mylene lacked the same energy or that ""je ne sais quois"" that she displayed in her previous acts. Nothwisthstanding, a very good concert anyhow.",1404950400,6,1097,4.425742574257426
8649088,5,B00J9KHZ9Q,"While in Paris we were at Forum Les Halle and FNAC where they had a huge screen playing this disc. WOW people were standing watching it and buying their copy. So did I. It's a great concert video.
Be advised it is in PAL format. I have to hook an HDMI cable to my computer to watch it at home on our large screen.
I don't know if it will be available in NTSC soon. BUT the show is great and of course Mylene is a heart stopper too
You will love it if you love Mylene!",1401408000,4,467,3.8247422680412373

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Timeless 2013 Le Film was the most awesome ambitious concert tour so far for Mylne Farmer, that went through several countries, including Paris, Lyon, Montpellier, Nantes, Strasbourg, Geneva, Minsk, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Brussels, Douai, Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand and Nice, but sadly not us in the United Kingdom and the public who saw this concert has always responded positively and helped greatly to the success of the most awesome French artist around. A tour with a budget of 30million, which brought together a total of nearly 535,000 spectators! This is again is another stunning directed film by the talented director Franois Hanns, who since the beginning of Mylne Farmer's massive awesome last 3 concerts, has shown off the potential of this brilliant French artist, plus another awesome contribution via Laurent Boutonnat, Mylne Farmer's mentor, who always wants to show off the best that this French artist can perform and especially who has produced all of her amazing songs and videos, that make other singing artists look totally amateurish?

Visually, the Timeless 2013 Le Film concert is totally stunning. But before the awesome concert can proceed, the room is plunged into total darkness; but before the immense curtain opens, you see no musicians or microphones, just a vast special effects curtain on which is displayed a starry constellation, which eventually forms the face of Mylne Farmer, that appears on her latest Timeless 2013 Compact Disc Album and especially with the Special Edition Box Set that I have and it is a beautiful presentation.

At the start of the concert, you get this amazing awesome pounding rhythm starts to pulsate, and then on this awesome video screen the video image takes us on a journey to the centre of an unknown planet. Light gradually gives way to an amazing tunnel [computer generated] effect, like we are travelling to the centre of Mylne Farmer's spaceship, that again is endless and makes the crowd scream for more in anticipation of seeing Mylne Farmer in person. Then after a long lengthy build up and especially building up the tension for the crowd, then finally as the screen pulls back a massive iris opens up revealing the singer Mylne Farmer and the crowd roar with total raptures excitement, especially to finally see Mylne Farmer appear in front of the audience and of course the crowd goes wild with jubilant excitement.

Dressed in a stunning outfit designed by Jean-Paul Gautier, Mylne Farmer is smiling and elegant. Conducted by Yvan Cassar, the group has two guitarists, two singers, a drummer, a bassist and a keyboard player. As in the past, the singer Mylne Farmer after the initial introduction while singing starts to do a brilliant dance routine, graciously assisted by six hunky muscular sexy male dancers, often wearing a simple loincloth and other out of this world unique outfits throughout the concert, which again was designed by Jean-Paul Gautier. Also a special dedication should go to Jean-Paul Gautier, who created six perfect outfits and more outrageous costumes that you always get with any Mylne Farmer concerts. In the end, Mylne Farmer cannot hold back her tears of happiness and joy. It only proves one thing: Mylne Farmer is indeed timeless, more than ever and is always made to last for ever and ever.

The sound is always outstanding and the voice of Mylne Farmer is for once not drowned in the loudness of the audience. Second highlight of the evening, the piano and voice sequence is an opportunity for the singer to say things to the audience with a smile and tears in her eyes. Despite the experience, Mylne Farmer always appreciates the loyalty of the adoring fans which responds to everything that Mylne Farmer presents in her outstanding and totally unique concerts.

Most times you only hear certain English words in Mylne Farmer's songs, but with this concert you get to hear Mylne Farmer actually sing in English and this happens when Mylne Farmer does duets with Moby [who only appears on the massive background video screen], but you get to see Mylne Farmer sing live on the stage [twice] with Gary Jules [who sang the Title song for the film `Donnie Darko'] and of course the crowd goes wild with appreciation.

Filmed in the stunning CinemaScope aspect ratio, with 30 high definition cameras and mixed in stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio by Tony Garmer, this retransmission gathered 101,107 spectators, including 95,000 in France in over 230 cinemas with a single date of 27th March 2014. Because this concert was filmed in the CinemaScope, you of course get black bands top and bottom of the screen.

Mylne Farmer became the first French artist to bring as many people to the cinema in a single session. The film was also released in Canada, Russia and Latvia in over 150 cinemas in total, but sadly us fans in the United Kingdom was sadly denied this total pleasure. After the Live Tour CD Album which was released last December, which so far has sold over 107,500 copies, I think the fans has waited long enough for the release of this mind blowing concert, especially on an even more awesome French Blu-ray 2 disc set and now our wait has finally been realised and it is has been well worth the wait!

Another stunning innovation is that Mylne Father is accompanied on stage by 2 amazing robots dancers [115 pounds] each that makes Mylne Farmer smile and then eventually further into the concert we get to see 5 robots all told, who do an amazing ballet sequence, which is a totally awesome experience and look so life like and has the crowd roar with approval, that is why Mylne Farmer is so innovative with all her concerts. These robot machines were originally employed on a production line of the semiconductor or pharmaceutical industries. Apart from the addition of a specially designed mask by Robolounge, which were not modified for the concert. Mylne Farmer discovered these robots during their passage through the programme ""An amazing talent"" on the French M6 TV channel in 2012. Again they are integrated with some choreography and are also given four minutes of amazing ShowTime in the show on their own.

As you might have guessed this Blu-ray DigiPack is very special to me, because you might know that Mylne Farmer is a true professional artist like no other in this world. But did you know that the people who love her are the greatest Fans in this world? This is another impressive example of why her concerts are a massive success, because you will see here with this Blu-ray an outstanding piece of work and you will see why Mylne Farmer really shows her appreciation to the fans at Bercy Concert venue. Again the concert is created through multiple of high definition cameras and you will be impressed with the excellent editing. They captured so many wonderful scenes, such impressive moments; and I just love this Timeless 2013 Le Film Concert. The film is crafted with love, and empowered by the never-ending passion for Mylne Farmer, who is just out of this world. And with this Blu-ray concert, you will see a never find such a relationship between an artist and his fans. Mylne Farmer would say, ""C'est magique.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Timeless 2013 Le Film has been brought to you in the best top quality of the Blu-ray format and you get an awesome 1080p encoded image, that gives you visual techniques that are out of this world, where you will observe amazing images that is characterised by highlighting a sharp colour that really blows you away, which is displayed together with a rendering of black combined with more than perfect. Without going on about the 1080p HD image, is totally perfect for the Blu-ray format and gives us a lot of surprises, I can freely write that the quality of video production is given to us in a sensation recorded ultra-realism, that is on par with Mylne Farmer's previous Blu-ray release Stade De France, that will also blow you away with again awesome stunning images, that is without doubt the BEST ever I have ever seen presented on a Blu-ray disc and is the best way to show off stunning visual effects as a reference for Blu-ray images, that cannot be beaten. So all in all I loved all what I viewed and was totally awe struck that what I viewed was the icing on the cake and at the end of concert with the final song, you get a dramatic effect where Mylne Farmer disappears under a massive dry ice sensation and gives the impression of a rocket taking off, that is totally gobsmacking sensation and I should image the audience felt it was even more spectacular being there totally live! Take for example the song that opened the show, during which Mylne Farmer and the dancers are dressed in outfits designed by the prolific and out of this world designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, that suits Mylne Farmer 100% and the Blu-ray really distinguishes the texture of the material. Technical prowess is totally natural. More than anything, the quality of the stunning colour images took my breath away and is a totally amazing experience and certainly captures why Blu-ray discs always gives us the awesome stunning images we deserve and offers a deep record (in the sense of space) and dynamics that are a resounding success. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Even more spectacular is the audio soundtrack, which is brought to you in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and also in 2.0 LPCM Stereo that takes your breath away that is total perfection, especially as everything is facilitated by the fact that it is a technically managed masterpiece. With the orchestration and the voice of Mylne Farmer is so natural in a concert environment and gives you effect that you are hearing it like an actual studio recording, but live! So, all in all it is technically impressive, and as always you get total technical brilliance collaboration with Laurent Boutonnat and Mylne Farmer together, they are perfectionists. Dynamics is also totally delicious, the voices are well placed and mixing those singers and Mylne Farmer give ""body"" to all, and I really enjoyed the sound of the brilliant professional musicians and voices in the quiet moments, really captured in a brilliant post production, where we hear perfectly Mylne Farmer sing, whisper, breathe, live Mylne Farmer does so brilliantly and especially with sincerity. Overall, the work on the 5.1 surround sound track is a totally mind blowing event, but the 2.0 LPCM audio track seemed very simplistic in comparison. Anyway, since you have the choice between 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the 2.0 LPCM audio track is a matter of choice, but I will always go for the 5.1 DTS-HD Surround sound, as this really shows you how a concert should be heard. This Blu-ray is a total MUST for all aficionados who want to get the best results from an awesome ultimate concert as this one! And it is an amazing technical innovation that the press had mentioned and especially in the amazing professional magazine Les Annes Laser and states that, ""Timeless 2013 Le Film is one of the few Blu-ray 1080p video proposing such a soundtrack."" Simply because this format brings a real plus bonus in terms of sound quality: the acute becomes more defined, and more importantly, you lose a lot less micro-information and subtleties, which Franois Hanss said in a private conversation and those extra exclusive information about the technical specifications on this Blu-ray. Mylne Farmer also said, ""I wanted to offer the public a real bonus, with absolutely new and very diverse of the Timeless 2013 Tour and hoping they will satisfy the most demanding critic!""

Finally, to sum up everything, all I can say is that this is again is another stunning spectacular Blu-ray disc that Universal Music has released and has certainly done a very professional job. The quality is totally awesome and when I first viewed this concert, I got very emotional, as that is what a Mylne Farmer concert does to me, but this Mylne Farmer: Timeless 2013 Le Film [Limited Edition Double Blu-ray Collector's DigiPack Set] is once again a totally emotional experience, like I also had with the equally brilliant Blu-ray disc Stade De France Blu-ray Concert, as the 1080p encoded images is again the BEST I have ever viewed and other people who have viewed this Blu-ray disc with me, says exactly the same and anyone who wants to show off a Blu-ray disc with the ultimate reference HD images, then this is a must purchase as the Mylne Farmer: Timeless 2013 Le Film Blu-ray disc will be your ultimate Blu-ray tour-de-force, as again your visitors will have an awesome jaw dropping experience, plus and equally awesome jaw dropping 5.1 DTS-HD Surround audio mix and that is why I am so proud to have this 2 Disc Special Edition in my Blu-ray Collection and each time I have viewed any of the Mylne Farmer concerts on Blu-ray discs, it always blows me away every time, especially with an experience that is hard to describe the awesome images you view in this review, as you have to actually experience it first hand on your 3D Flat Screen Widescreen Television and also your Home Cinema set-up to appreciate my reviews that I am trying to portray for you. But most important, I just wish they would release the other Mylne Farmer Concerts and all of her awesome Music Videos that are only available on Region 2 DVD discs, as they deserve the ultimate Blu-ray treatment and then my Mylne Farmer Collection will be complete for the time being, until another Concert is released sometime in the near future. Despite the Blu-ray discs released so far are only on the Region B/2 format, sadly as stated above, for people living in the North American Region A/1 area, to view any of the Blu-ray Mylne Farmer Concerts, you will of course have to purchase a Multi-region Blu-ray Player, which I know will be well worth it, as I know the images you see, will blow you away and you will experience something that is only unique to the awesome Mylne Farmer. Very Highly Recommended!
