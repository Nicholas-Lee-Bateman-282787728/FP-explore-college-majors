8178373,4,B000NJLXS6,"I must admit that the only reason I watched this movie is becaue I love westerns, and watching one from 1935 is better than watching the trash that is on today.  I was surprisingly glad that it turned out to be worth watching, the story line was good, and acting was OK, and beside throwing the pistol forward every time they shoot, it was well worth watching.",1481155200,,360,4.373134328358209

The movie begins with two men talking about a land deal. Sir Henry Sheffield goes to see Rontel, the lawyer. His associates in British Continental intend to make a large investment there in one district. Sabotage results in barn burnings and cattle theft. ""Something has to be done."" ""How can you fight something you can't see?"" Will some sell out and move away? Lawyer Rontel attends the meeting. Cowboys sing for entertainment. ""Wherever there is money there is excitement."" Rontel has a prisoner in his basement! Will he sign the agreement? Cowboys move a herd, four riders attack two men on a wagon. Two others ride up, and decide to help the old man by stopping the attackers. Then Hayden's men ride up, the conflict is halted. Tucson Smith and Stony Martin were herding cattle for sale. Hayden needs men for help. The four would-be assassins worked for Rontel. One who survived dwill get a new gang for help. Rontel plans another murder. The man who objected gets a payoff from Rontel.

Jean Hayden and her father visit Rontel, Smith and Martin go along. Rontel has a wall painting at his peaceful ranch. Smith and Martin will investigate the killings. Who is the spy who knows Hayden's plans. Rontel admits he bought the land after the owners were killed. Smith tells people about his plans to see what will happen. Rontel's men plan an ambush. Smith is the best lead-slinger yet. One of the men was part of the Benton gang. Rontel agrees they should investigate the Benton gang. While they are in the cantina some men pull their pistols, a bad career move for them. There is another song about a lonely trail. Rontel meets Joe Sanchez, the best gunman for hire. ""It looks funny."" [Bringing in an expert stranger to do a killing is an old strategy.] Sanchez is tipped off to Smith and Martin. But there is a surprise! Rontel orders his man to take care of Sanchez, or else. We learn about Joe, he will ride the straight and narrow path now. A rifle shot stops Joe from talking. They have almost enough evidence.

Smith learns about Rontel's financial condition. He has access to large funds through power of attorney. Smith learns about Sir Henry Sheffield; he never left the area. Smith plans a showdown. The valley will be sealed off, other ranchers will gather. Stony will shadow Rontel, but he is shot in the back. ""Smith is coming."" Rontel is warned and sets a trap. But Smith enters through a window, shots are exchanged with Rontel's henchmen. Smith wasn't ambushed. He asks about Sheffield, the geologist who discovered oil. Smith chastises Rontel for disrespecting the law. The sheriff tells Hayden about Smith's background. There may be a happy ending for Smith and Joan now.

The usual plot of the classic Western movie of that era was to prevent a big landowner (like a corporation) from swindling small ranchers out of their valuable property. [Small movie studios were similarly threatened by big movie studios who also owned theatre chains.] Were gunmen used as part of their takeover? The small ranchers could only defend themselves when they united for a common purpose. [This would also apply to the workers in a factory.] The hero who led this resistance would often win the daughter of a small rancher, rewarding his prowess with a happy ending.",1290902400,,3301,4.755671902268761
