8729345,5,B0141RBHFE,"Harry Baur is a great find, can't wait to see him in Les Miserables, but this set of films are about Julien Duvivier, a master director.  He had great vision, pacing his films with details not found in much of the films of that time.  He gave you a much better continuity of character evolution and story. None of the sudden cuts in the flow of the story.
There is much to be admired here by film buffs.",1463270400,5,403,4.153846153846154
8729346,5,B0141RBHFE,"Excellent quartet of films directed by Julien Duvivier  in the 1930s. They are subtitled for viewers who do not understand French.  The outstanding film of the group is Poi de Carotte (1932) which stars 12 year old Robert Lynen in an outstanding film debut and Harry Baur as his father.  This film is of great historical interest due to the fact that both stars died at the hands of the Nazis.  Baur died after being tortured in 1943 and 23 year old Lynen, who had joined the French Resistance was executed by firing squad in 1944.",1461801600,7,531,4.5
8729347,5,B0141RBHFE,"The four films n this collection include performances by Harry Baur, murdered by the Nazis.  The most famous is Un Carnet de Bal in which an ageing rich woman thinks back in her imagination to her dream of splendid balls ages before. She tries to reconnect with the people of that past. As the great critic James Agate said, there are inimitable performances by Marie Bell,  wonderful clowning by Fernandel  and the exquisite playing of Francoise Rosay.  It is all set in a kind of dream and memorable to see.  Julien Duvivier  is one of the greatest French directors.",1461024000,4,568,4.686868686868687
8729348,5,B0141RBHFE,"Julien Duvivier was one of the top French directors of the mid-century, yet only one of his films-- Pepe le Moko, of ""Come wiz me to ze Casbah fame""-- has been readily available in America before now. (It's on Criterion DVD.) This Eclipse set offer two bona fide classics and two other interesting works from the early talkie era, and is essential viewing for anyone interested in classic French film.

Poil de Carotte, Carrot-Top, is a good-hearted, boisterous boy (10 or so) in the wrong family: he came along unexpectedly, his priggish, unhappy mother resents and dislikes him, his preoccupied father (Harry Baur, who's in all four films) mostly ignores him (and the family in general), focusing on a planned run for mayor. The simplicity of this sad story couldn't fail to reach anybody; Robert Lynens is heartbreaking as the boy who just wants to be loved. Set in a real prewar French village, it's a wonderfully atmospheric film as well as a moving one.

Un Carnet de Bal, in English Dance Card, is about a woman who decides to look up the men-- boys, mostly-- she danced with at one ball when she was 16, to see where her life took its turn. Really an anthology film, nearly all the stories are about regret and failure, featuring many of the top actors of the era (Baur, Raimu, Fernandel, Louis Jouvet, etc.), and if it stretches credulity that she encounters so many dark tales from one youthful dance, well, you can't say everybody doesn't act these stories to the nines.

The other two films aren't on the same level but they're certainly worthwhile. David Golder is a powerfully acted film about a financier who is fed up with working himself to death for his ungrateful wife and daughter, while La Tete d'un Homme casts Baur as Inspector Maigret, in a tale that seems to visually anticipate Hitchcock. Duvivier seems to have been one of the first directors to really understand sound pictures, while carrying over a lot of the expressionist visuals of the silent era, and he certainly knew how to get sensitive performances. Print quality is excellent for David Golder and Poil de Carotte, a little rougher for the other two, but all four will reward the attention given to them.",1454630400,10,2192,4.732984293193717
