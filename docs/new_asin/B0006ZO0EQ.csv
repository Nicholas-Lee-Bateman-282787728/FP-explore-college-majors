2197837,4,B0006ZO0EQ,"The Dangerous Christmas Of Red Riding Hood is an adorable TV special brought back from the vaults for us to watch and enjoy. Sure, the print is black and white--and it's not even good quality black and white; but it's still quite entertaining if you're not too picky about it. They should have restored the print more, of course, so this won't be a five star review.

Of course, the story is essentially the story of Red Riding Hood with a few twists here and there. Naturally the main revision is that now this is a Christmastime tale. Liza Minnelli plays Red Riding Hood; and Cyril Ritchard does a great job as the wolf (that's Mr. Lone T. Wolf to you). Look also for The Animals to play the wolf's cronies; and Vic Damone turns in a great performance as a prince turned into a woodchopper by some evil spell.

The action begins with the wolf--in a cage now--telling us he's going to tell us the ""real"" version of what happened. Well, little changes--but the story is embellished very nicely with The Animals singing very well and playing their electric guitars. Liza and Cyril dance very well; and the actors playing the woodland creatures perform some wonderful ballet routines during the course of the movie. Naturally, Little Red Riding Hood is saved by the woodchopper hero and everyone (except the wolf) is happy ever after.

This film has historical significance and sentimental value to Liza Minnelli fans; and people will enjoy The Animals playing some bit parts and singing their best. Cyril Ritchard couldn't be better; you truly get the feeling he enjoyed doing this.

Now there's the major issue of the quality of the print. I don't mind black and white. However, the print needs major restoration. The print suffers from scratches, rounded corners at the edges and a noticeable amount of fading. That disappoints me.

Overall, this excellent, underappreciated and long forgotten Christmas television special program displays the sublime talents of the actors and actresses. Liza Minnelli positively shines every time she smiles in this film. I highly recommend this for Liza fans and fans of older television shows; and here's hoping that they can restore this sometime soon.",1204243200,9,2191,4.894878706199461
2197838,5,B0006ZO0EQ,"Liza Minnelli, Cyril Ritchard, Vic Damone, and Eric Burdon & The Animals star in this 1965 TV musical-comedy - a tale of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" from the wolf's perspective.

There are clever word-plays liberally sprinkled throughout the performance; a broadway-style musical score by Jule Styne; plus British Rock & Rollers, Eric Burdon & The Animals"" (House Of The Rising Sun) appearing as a juvenile delinquent wolf pack.

Cyril Ritchard (Captain Hook in Mary Martin's ""Peter Pan"") as Lone T. Wolf, and a teenaged Liza Minnelli as Lillian ""Red Riding"" Hood, are absolutely brilliant. ""Dangerous Christmas"" is 5-Star Holiday Fun for the whole family. Ahhh, if only it was in color...",1198972800,2,686,5.171171171171171
2197839,2,B0006ZO0EQ,"I remember watching this show as a kid, and hadn't seen it since then until I bought this DVD. Unlike what others have written, I don't recall seeing a budget release of this on VHS. Unfortunately, as others have written, this is a watchable, but still substandard quality b&w kinescope transfer, and not from the original color videotape source (AMAZON, please correct the listing!).
Even if this DVD had used a pristine quality color videotape source, I would still only give it 2&1/2, maybe 3 stars. This show is a low budget (the sets look like something from a school play), over-acted disappointment.  I'm surprised the cast,especially  Cyril Ritchard, wasn't bleeding from their mouths due to all the splinters they must have recieved from all their scenery chewing performances. The story has a minimal Christmas connection- it is set on Christmas eve, Christmas is mentioned once or twice in one song, there's a Christmas tree in the background in one scene, and instead of ""goodies"" in her basket, Red Riding Hood is bringing Christmas presents to Granny (who is never seen, even after the Wolf is defeated, she remains trapped in a trunk!).
I bought this mainly because of the Animals being in the cast. Their two songs are OK; one rocks pretty good. Liza has a couple of OK songs but , on the whole it is a dated curiosity that would have been a good value as maybe a $4.99 budget disc, but not $17.99!",1195257600,6,1414,4.720647773279352

2197841,1,B0006ZO0EQ,"This DVD of Dangerous Christmas is NOT in COLOR as all the listings for it indicate.  It is not even a digital transfer.  The source material is the old VHS master from the budget VHS tapes of this title that were released for several years.  This is a grainy, dirty image that contains numerous film breaks and splices.  The bonus inclusion of the original soundtrack that was originally released on ABC Paramount records is a clumsy transfer that contains skips in several of the cuts.

This is a DVD to avoid if you have this material in any other format.  This DVD is not an upgrade in any way from the old VHS tape or the old LP recording.",1193616000,18,644,4.369747899159663

8044159,5,B0006ZO0EQ,"I loved this when it came out.  I guess since I saw it on a black and white tv I didn't expect it to be in color like some of the other reviewers did.  It was as I remembered it.  I had made a recording of it on a reel to reel tape recorder and I played it an obnoxious number of times for the next ten years.  I knew all the songs and had a great time singing along.

Actually,this is the second one I have ordered from Amazon.  The first I purchased three years ago at about $7.  My grandson broke that one and so this was a replacement.  I was sad that it had gone up $10 in that time.  I guess that's business.",1394236800,,614,3.7716535433070866
8044160,2,B0006ZO0EQ,"Amazon does not pay enough attention to the accuracy of their listings. For instance, ""Dangerous Christmas of Little Red Riding Hood"" is listed at the Amazon site as being in COLOR. It is not in color. I even took the time to send an email to customer service requesting confirmation that this title was indeed in color BEFORE ordering it. I received a reply back from customer service stating:  ""I have checked and can confirm that ""Dangerous Christmas of Little Red Riding Hood"" is available in color and the information has been updated correctly."" Best Regards,  Shwetank
I ordered it not once, but twice, relying on the information given by customer service and both of the DVDS are in B&W not color as stated and promised. So there in lies my case as first stated in my opening sentence, Edward Haslett",1378598400,3,808,4.723404255319149
8044161,5,B0006ZO0EQ,"I generally do not put my two cents into this type of misinformation ""free-for-all"" but, having read everyone's opinion on what I have always considered to be one of television's finest productions, I couldn't sit by and listen anymore. As a retired university professor (I taught an in-depth course in musical theater history) much of what I read here was written by people with very little love or understanding of the developments of 20th century American musical theater.

""The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood, or Oh Wolf, Poor Wolf,"" originally broadcast over the ABC network during Christmas of 1965, proved so popular that ABC repeated the broadcast the following Christmas season. (Most likely the last time it was seen in color; rebroadcasts were rare 45 years ago.) I was only 11 years old at the time, but I still remember watching and enjoying both broadcasts. ""Red"" was a TV special and not a movie. It was filmed in a television studio using the ""live-on-tape"" method. (The camera was pretty much stationary and post-production was quick and without much editing or close ups.) The music was performed live in the studio. And so, if you listen to the original cast recording (recorded not in 1965, but a year later in 1966) you will notice some major differences between the performances. On the recording there is now an overture and two full ballets which add at least 15 minutes to the brief running time of the show (neither of which were a part of the broadcast). And the Animals must not have been available for the recording date because they do not sing in the song ""Snubbed"" with the wolf. (Instead, on the LP, this ensemble piece is turned into a solo for Cyril Ritchard who admirably sings both his and the Animals' parts, making the wolf sound somewhat psycho and much funnier than on the TV special.) The Animals performance of ""We're Gonna Howl Tonight"" was not re-recorded for the album, but was taken directly off the soundtrack of the broadcast; hence, the sound quality goes from stereo to monaural on the album during that one number. Overall, the performances are first rate on the LP. The ""ad libs"" are funnier, the orchestra is larger, and even the lyrics received a sprucing up.

The show was originally broadcast in color. But, as was the case in much of early TV, the reel of tape that housed the show was worth more than the material it preserved because the color broadcast of ""Red"" was eventually erased and the reel reused to preserve another ABC show. What exists today on VHS and DVD is an inferior black and white kinescope of the broadcast. (Before the invention of recordable video tape, television primitively preserved its history by placing a film camera in front of a TV monitor during a broadcast. That explains the distorted image.) The entire production was meant to be performed with tongue firmly planted in cheek. We understood that in 1965. Few in today's audiences ""get it"" now. The art of satire is, unfortunately, lost today and this type of comedy is mistakenly called ""corny."" And so, the charm of this small masterpiece is also lost.

For years, I showed this delightful musical to my music theater students at Christmastime. It is a perfect example of what we came to know as the end of Broadway musicals as we we knew them (falling, as it does, after ""Fiddler On the Roof"" and ""Hello Dolly,"" but before ""Mame"" and ""Company""). ""Red""provides us with the opportunity to observe Liza Minnelli as she evolved from a mass of nervous teenage energy into a confident and well-rounded superstar; hear the brilliant Broadway-quality score of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill; and, best of all, experience one of the world's greatest comic performers, Cyril Ritchard, in one of his most hilarious roles.

Yes, pray for a better copy to come alone. But while we wait, let's just be happy that this beat-up copy exists for our enjoyment.

8044163,4,B0006ZO0EQ,"Whether it's black and white or the original colour format, I'll take THE DANGEROUS CHRISTMAS OF RED RIDING HOOD however I can.  This charming time capsule from the golden age of TV musical extravaganzas stars Liza Minnelli in the title role, plus Cyril Ritchard as the Wolf.

So, you think you know the tale of Red Riding Hood, the helpless young moppet who strayed from her path only to wind up in the belly of a hungry Wolf?  Think again!  The Big Bad Wolf is neither big nor particuarly bad, and would like to properly explain HIS side of the fairytale - and it's clearly not entirely the way that Little Red would have you believe...

1965 was a banner year for Liza Minnelli.  She had just wowed Broadway in the short-lived ""Flora the Red Menace"" (for which she'd receive a Tony Award) and her vocal talents were in peak force.  No stranger to musicals either on Broadway or TV, Cyril Ritchard had appeared several times as Captain Hook in Mary Martin's ""Peter Pan"", and also starred in Cole Porter's TV musical production of ""Aladdin"".

Composer Jule Styne and lyricist Bob Merrill (also represented on Broadway with ""Funny Girl"" that same year) furnished the score of DANGEROUS CHRISTMAS... with some enchanting pieces for Minnelli (""My Red Riding Hood"", ""I'm Naive"").  Vic Damone, Marlene Dell, Bette Henritze and The Animals co-star.

This DVD presents a well-worn (but still very watchable) B&W print of the show; it was originally broadcast in full colour but, like I mentioned above, I'll take this musical however I can!  The original soundtrack album is included as an extra (accessible on DVD players only).  Ideally I'd like to see the album reissued on CD one day.  It's a really fun show; Minnelli fans in particular will especially enjoy it.",1279670400,2,1761,4.791390728476821
8044164,5,B0006ZO0EQ,"This show is one of my favorites. The three stars along with the rock group The Animals take this over the top special to new heights. The score is one of my favorites by Julie Styne and Bob Merrill. Although it is in Black and White it doesn't lessen the heart and warmth of the story, in fact I think it helps it. If you love Liza or Cyril or Vic buy the treasure you won't be sorry, especially when the infectious eleven oclock number Ding-A-Ling hits the screen!",1259280000,,466,4.247191011235955
