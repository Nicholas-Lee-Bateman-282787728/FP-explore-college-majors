7832002,4,6302812208,"Der Bingle and Jane Wyman team up again for this glossy Technicolor spectacle, in which Broadway star Bing is torn between his duty to his children (who are alienated because of his workaholic tendencies) and his budding love life (which, unfortunately, involves Jane Wyman, who I find quite unappealing).  It's an okay film, very white picket fence-y and Eisenhower-ish... The musical numbers don't have any cohesion, but that's okay -- they're clearly just meant to be eye candy and pad the film out... (Cast notes: Bing's son, Gary, plays his petulant son, while a teenage Natalie Wood plays the daughter... and sparkles in many a scene...) Kind of a ho-hum, melodramatic plot, but it's an entertaining enough movie, with some choice moments of campy fun.  Not bad.",1094428800,,768,5.039370078740157
7832003,4,6302812208,"Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman star in this backstage musical comedy that delivers on all levels. Great songs, including the Academy Award winning song Zing, A Little Zong,"" beautifully delivered by the leads, and great sets and vintage 50's costumes too. The cast is none to shabby either...with Ethel Barrymore, and a very young Natalie Wood.
This is the kind of great musical that I wish they still made, but never will again. Thank God for Tape and DVD. I highly recommend this movie.",987552000,8,484,4.773809523809524
