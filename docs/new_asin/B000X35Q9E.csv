2997745,5,B000X35Q9E,"We were so excited to see the new box set. Finally, we can get all three DVDs together plus the music from them to play in the car. Our kids love these DVDs - they are sweet and wholesome and the music rocks!  We love to give them as birthday presents because the kids love them and they teach good manners and kindness - among other things. My little boy loves the animals too!  Great programming for kids!!",1203206400,,408,4.217948717948718
2997746,5,B000X35Q9E,"My 2-year-old daughter loves these DVDs!  She says, ""The Bus, the bus, mommy""!  Sometimes she wants to watch them over and over.  After a while, it starts driving me crazy, but she has so much fun singing and dancing along.  I haven't played the CD in the car yet, but I'm sure it will be enjoyed! I highly recommend this box set.",1260403200,,330,4.274193548387097
2997747,5,B000X35Q9E,"She wants to watch these DVDs every time. She almost memorized the songs. They are good encouragement for her to do something.
You can watch them after you finish the meal!!! And right away she accomplishes her job.",1258156800,,215,4.684210526315789
2997748,5,B000X35Q9E,My daughter loves all three videos.  We sing this song everywhere we go.  She is 15 months.,1254441600,,91,4.294117647058823
2997749,5,B000X35Q9E,My kids don't watch much TV but LOVE these movies! I can put one of these on and make dinner or take a shower and they watch the whole thing! (2 1/2 years and 1 year.) And it's educational so I don't feel guilty. My oldest loves singing the songs. Great videos!,1246665600,,261,4.038461538461538
2997750,5,B000X35Q9E,"This is a great DVD set. My child loves this DVD set, she wants to watch it everyday.  This is very educational and entertaining, even for me.  This DVD set is a great value with the 3 DVD's and 1 music CD.  I highly recommend this to anyone with kids.",1241395200,,252,4.0
2997751,5,B000X35Q9E,"This was recommended to us by my half-sister who had a 2 year old at the time.  Our son absolutely fell in love with this series since he was about 19 months old.  The programs are very well done and educational, but what really sets this apart from others is the fantastic original music that even the parents will fall in love with.  Highly recommended!",1223856000,,355,4.430769230769231
2997752,5,B000X35Q9E,"My two year old won't stop watching it at home and listening the songs in the car. No more fuss as long as ""the wheel"" is on! Wonderful buy.",1216252800,5,140,3.8620689655172415
2997753,5,B000X35Q9E,My 22 month old loves these movies and also plays the cd in the car.  Even her 4 1/2 brother loves them.,1214611200,,104,3.727272727272727
2997754,5,B000X35Q9E,"Our family has been following this series since my daughter was 1.  I was so thrilled to find something that she loved to watch over and over again... that I didn't mind hearing over and over again.  The music is fabulous, and the messages are simple and sweet - every age in our extended family is still watching these DVDs.  For adults, having Roger Daltrey as the dragon is a nice bonus.  And, Laura Hall's compositions are sweet, catchy, and pure fun for every age.
My daughter is now 5 1/2, and she still loves these DVDs.  She's not alone!",1214006400,8,545,4.41
2997755,5,B000X35Q9E,"I purchased this, without much knowledge but in light of reviews, for my two-and-a-half-year-old grandson as a match for the Lazy Town DVD his five-year-old sister had convinced me to buy for her. It has proved to be a great choice. Both children love it, have learned the songs from the CD, and ask endless questions about the people on the bus, where they might be going and what their stories might be. Their imagination and engagement extend well beyond the screen. Although each episode is reasonably long, the pacing of stops, music, real places (zoo, aquarium)and the bus itself, is well suited to very young children - and not tedious for adults. This is a great find.",1205107200,8,676,4.737288135593221

8226766,5,B000X35Q9E,Ok so I probably bought these two years ago when my son was two and if I put them on now he is still mesmerized to this day!!!  I totally recommend them and would totally pass them along again.,1344556800,,193,3.948717948717949
8226767,5,B000X35Q9E,"My granddaughter and I first checked this out at the library.  She was so intrigued and absorbed into this dvd that she wanted to watch it over and over.  Then came the time to return the dvd.  She was so disappointed.  I bought this on line before her 3rd birthday.  And now she has the whole set (3 movies and 1 CD) and loves playing the movies and listening and singing to the music CD in the car.  In fact, she wanted to be Argon the Dragon for Halloween. It's entertaining and provides a fun musical way to educate your toddler. She loves it. The product also came sooner than the expected date of delivery.",1320710400,,612,4.278260869565218
8226768,5,B000X35Q9E,"This whole series is great!  I don't know what to say here that other people haven't said already.  I have a 10-month old and a 2 1/2 year old, and they both LOVE these videos.  The songs are really cute, and I don't even mind when I have the songs stuck in my head forever.  The producers of this series really seem to know young children well because they have a great mix of story line and music (lots of music mixed in with a simple story line that holds the attention of really young kids).  My only complaint would be that they only have 3 videos in the series -- I wish they had more!!",1318896000,,592,4.068965517241379
8226769,5,B000X35Q9E,"I play this when we are on trips in the car and my 20 month old daughter is sooo tuned into this show! The only time she moves is to sing along when they sing. She imitates them laughing when they say the people on the bus laughs and then its right back to gazing at the screen. She loves this show and when i play it, she claps excitedly! Definitely has made driving around with her easier. Would recommend for sure too!",1305763200,,421,4.0843373493975905
8226770,5,B000X35Q9E,"We bought this set for the kids almost 2 years ago (3 DVD's one CD) and they still absolutely love it. The series introduces kids to animals, insects, amphibians, birds, fish, etc., as well as manners, making friends, etc., in way that is fun and totally on their level. Positive messages abound, as well as good eating choices (they go to Whole Foods and buy fruits and vegetables), the songs are fun and go way beyond the theme of ""wheels on the bus"". With all the other garbage out there, such as Spongebob (which I can't believe people actually let their kids watch), etc., the ""Wheels On the Bus"" is a gem in the ruff, a real godsend. And because ""Wheels On the Bus"" is relatively obscure compared to Nickelodian programs, you won't be harassed by constant ""branding""/corporate attempts to hijack your child's hearts and minds (and your dollars). I love this series, our children love it and I would recommend it for anyone's kids.",1303344000,,936,4.678787878787879
8226771,5,B000X35Q9E,We ordered this product back in October (it is now February) and it still hasn't arrived yet.  This is the first time Amazon.com has let me down.  Very disappointed.  I rated the product 5 stars only because I am familiar with the DVD's in this series.  The DVD's are EXCELLENT... if you can get them !,1297641600,,302,4.339285714285714
8226772,5,B000X35Q9E,"We bought this when my daughter was 2 and she was obsessed with it, then she was over it.  She is now 3.5 and asked to watch it again and became obsessed all over again!  Wish there were more.",1296950400,,192,3.8974358974358974
8226773,5,B000X35Q9E,"I was apprehensive about buying DVDs for my 1.5 year old at first but he used to be so interested in these songs on youtube, so i decided to try it out.
He likes to watch them everyday & has picked up a lot of words too.
It is well made with toddlers & kids in mind. the songs have message about good eating habits, sharing & being nice.
I would recommend this DVD everyone.",1282262400,,374,4.0
8226774,5,B000X35Q9E,"Our two year old loves it.  His face lights up when it the video starts.  Roger Daltry (of the Who) is great as Argon the dragon.  The tunes are quite catchy.  Adults who are serious about audio/video will notice that the audio and video on the DVD are not in perfect sync.  The behinds the scenes making of video shows that the audio is done in a recording studio and when the video is shot apparently the actors and puppets apparently lip sync.  Your toddler will not notice or care.  The video teaches positive life lessons getting along, sharing, being helpful, and not procrastinating.  These lesson are interspersed between characters riding on bus and singing new verses of the wheels on the bus song.  Very cute.  You will find the songs in your head later.  Our son prefers these videos to his prior favorite which was elmo DVDs.  This video series is excellent.  The small increase in price for the box set makes this the best choice of the various Wheels on the Bus choices. There are several segments/trailers of this product on YouTube.",1273276800,,1049,4.635869565217392
8226775,5,B000X35Q9E,"My daughter is 2 and loves this video.  She always wants to watch the bus.  The video is cute, and luckily there are 3 so you can switch between the videos so it doesn't get too repetitive.  I only wish they made more!",1262822400,,218,4.023255813953488
