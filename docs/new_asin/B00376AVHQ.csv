First, I thought the backstory to the premise of this film was not explained well. Second, I think the casting of military personnel in the film could have been done better. Third, I feel the ending was rather anticlimactic compared to the beginning of the film itself.

The lithium chases a boat of humans and a water skier as sources of water  but ignores a whole lake full of water? I cannot believe I watched it. Even I, never in the military, could see the many errors in the uniforms of the soldiers and the way the hazmat team,in protective gear, worked in the midst of everyone else who had no protective gear at all..

Sorbo and girlfriend (who lacks both looks AND personality) waltz around one dead body after another with the calmness of finding bunny rabbits along their path. ""The coffee's still hot,"" she says. ""We'd better get out of here--fast."" This from a girl who had, just minutes ago, fallen into the lake where a bloated, fried dead man bobbed up right next to her. Sorbo says, ""Are you all right?"" and she says, ""Yes, now that I'm over the initial shock."" Yes, dear, how clinical of you to notice that.

4080402,4,B00376AVHQ,"I enjoyed ""Fire From Below.""

You might expect this to be one of those cheesy and silly ""B-Grade"" science fiction movies.  You'd be right.  Hey, it's the truth.  There's enough cheese to make a good Tex-Mex queso, and it's silly enough for the queso to then go on-stage for comic improv.  Just say'n.

Accept the silly premise, and there is an action-adventure that keeps you engaged, occasionally smiling, and overall glad for the experience.

""Fire From Below"" is a disaster-sci-fi adventure.  A rich industrialist whose personality approaches ""super-villian"" puts--you guessed it--his profit above safety.  Trying to unearth a ""super lithium"" that has applications ranging from energy to super-strong and lightweight tank armor, he bullies his beleaguered miners into inadvertently igniting the ore.  This starts a fusion chain reaction that will lead to the End of the World!

Enter our band of heroes.  Following normal hero ethos of the genre, they risk lives and relationships to Save the World.

Oh, did I mention that the ""fire from below"" that releases as this fusion reaction builds will pursue humans with a ""near intelligent"" behavior.  Yes, it chases you down and incinerates you!

I warned you the premise was silly.  Now put it aside.  Once you accept it, the story is much better than you'd expect.  ""Fire From Below"" mixes humor, adventure, and characters well.  Direction and production quality is what you'd expect from a ""B-Movie"" that I strongly suspect was a low-budget TV movie.  That doesn't get in the way of the story, though.  Acting was surprisingly good for this type of movie, though no Oscars were awarded.",1404950400,4,1638,5.082706766917293

4080415,1,B00376AVHQ,"I love earth-in-peril disaster movies, even if I have to ignore reality and stretch my imagination.  But even my lowest expectations couldn't save me from this awful movie.

The story line is flimsy, but even a thin story can have redeeming qualities if the scenes are at least marginally plausible.  But not THIS one.  A few examples?

How about a reservoir that is super-heating because of underwater lithium fires, making the water so hot that it's cracking the dam-- the dam made of steel and concrete-- yet the workers are standing RIGHT NEXT to the water and not even breaking a sweat.  How about tubes of fire that randomly spring up and chase humans because the tubes are seeking water (moisture in our bodies) to create an explosive reaction?  Movie is full of that, but the most insulting scene was a fire tube chasing people in a boat.  Umm, wouldn't the LAKE be a greater source of moisture?  Ugh, and it gets worse from there.

There were so many scenes where an intense situation is just about to hit its climax, and then...... nothing.... leaving us wondering what just happened.  It's like seeing a runaway truck barreling towards a mother pushing a baby in the stroller, the mother has a horrified look in her eyes knowing she is 2 seconds from sudden death.... then the mother is next seen talking to a friend at the coffee shop.  You'd be shouting, what the heck happened to the truck???  How did she escape???  But it's never explained and you're forever left wondering.

Another scene had some military guys and civilians near a lake when more lithium fires erupt.  Rather than rescue those who are struggling to escape, the military leader says to forget it, there's nothing we can do, let's get out of here.  That's a complete insult to our brave soldiers who risk their own lives to save their teammates.

Final climax had a fireball shooting out of the mine heading straight toward the crew, people had shock and terror in their eyes knowing they were all about to die, and...... nothing.  Inexplicably the fire is suddenly gone from the scene.  What just happened?  The viewer is never told.

Best way to describe this move is, take the worst daytime soap opera ever made, mix it with completely impossible science, leave all sense of reason at the door, and don't ask any questions because they will never be answered or resolved.

This movie was too poorly written even for my ""love cheesy disaster movies"" tastes.  If you have 90 minutes of your life to throw away and never get back, watch it.  Otherwise, save yourself, run far away from it and never look back.  This movie is complete garbage.",1400630400,,2625,4.676855895196507

I got about halfway through this because I was tired and didn't want to watch something where I had to think too hard, but this is awful-at one point I saw there were about 45 minutes left and I said ""Oh, no!"".

The only good things I have to say about this movie is the scenery in the underground cavern is pretty, and the actors playing the miners in the beginning were the only believable characters.  I just couldn't believe that Sorbo was playing a Ph. D in seismology, and he and his fiancee (who apparently is a doctor too, but in what? she was supposed to be working with him, so I guess she's in earthquakes too.)  These people, who study ROCKS, suddenly figure out what the problem is-a chemical ELEMENT, and as far as I could tell, nobody saw it behave like that before.  And a group goes right to the source, and aren't overcome and killed by fumes, like the over 200 people in the town some miles away were.  I'm not even going to bother finishing this.

An implausible premise, poorly developed characters, recycled predictable plotlines with no twists or turns, silly dialog, an average music score, obvious stock footage, no memorable lines, etc. I won't summarize the plot here (wouldn't want to spoil it) ;-) but think greed-caused natural disaster with the day saved by brave scientists. It's an honorable old science fiction plot, but it goes nowhere here.

The two main characters are likable enough, but don't go anywhere either.  The intro of the 'ex girlfriend' had potential, but again, nothing happens.  The 'action' is incredibly boring - I knew we were in trouble when the boat chase scene at the beginning went on and on (about twice as long as it should have)without any tension building. My interest was piqued when we went underground (I used to spelunk) but the gaudy colored lighting and strong backlighting (justified by calling it phosphorescence) along with the reuse of the same formations for different levels stopped that quickly.  No, not even good photography in this one.  I give it two stars to salute Sorbo and Albach for maintaining semi-likable characters with so little to work with in the script, but that's about it.

Not recommended, unless you are an avid fan of the genre, have nothing better to do, and don't mind boring movies.  The good news is that a few hours after watching this movie, you won't remember much about it. That's because nothing happens worth remembering.",1379462400,,1586,4.9772727272727275

I think this must be one of those really cheap made for TV movies that the SYFY channel airs.

All I saw when I reserved this thing was a short description, and that it starred Kevin Sorbo (Hercules Series). I figured that if it had Sorbo it couldn't be all bad. It wasn't all bad, just mostly bad.

To put it in a nutshell, this movies was so full of holes, I felt a draft while watching it.

The whole premise was stupid from the start. Corporate miners strike a pure lithium source which proceeds to shoot out and kill them all. The fireball follows people around until it vaporizes them, then it goes away itself.

There is the chance that the deposit will explode in a nuclear type blast, but Sorbo, his girlfriend, and ex-girlfriend still have time to talk about stupid stuff. The girlfriend is jealous of the Ex, and the Ex just wanted to hear an apology from Sorbo.

Two of the team gets trapped in the caverns and are making their way to the surface, only they are going at about ten steps a minute. I suppose they had to shuffle their feet because the set wasn't big enough.

Sorbo goes into the caverns with two soldiers to blow up the lithium vein with some kind of fancy bomb. He takes the EX along. He tells his girlfriend that she couldn't go because it wasn't her field of expertise. The Ex didn't do anything but stop walking at one point and talk more stupid stuff. She got her apology from Sorbo so all was well: Except they still had not set the charges. This is all she did. The only reason that she was in this particular story line was the idiotic apology.

The bombs go off, the Earth is saved, blah, blah, blah.

In case you are wondering, there was nothing on TV that I wanted to watch so I wasted 89 minutes of my life watching this instead.

Oh the agony! :p",1339718400,9,1802,4.26099706744868
4080477,2,B00376AVHQ,"Writers keep coming up with new ideas where strange phenomena cause great destruction.  Unfortunately, while Fire From Below (2009) features a threat from an unusual source, not much else in this B-movie is new or compelling, although the special effects are at least passable.  The screenplay features the usual cadre of clichd characters, sprouting the same kind of drivel that you've heard a thousand times before.  Complementing the uninspired screenplay, are some weak acting performances and unrealistic looking sets.  The finish seems relatively exciting, only because what preceded, is so dull and ridiculous.  Be sure not to confuse this film with Steven Seagal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Down-Below/dp/6304707622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Down Below</a>&nbsp;(1998).

Seismologist Jake Denning (Kevin Sorbo) and his fianc Dr. Kerrie Watkins (Maeghan Albach) are on their way to a lake for a little relaxation, however a destructive phenomenon occurring in the area ruins their plans.  A dangerous lithium isotope has been released from a mine, and has somehow become ""animated"".  The threat is manifested as floating balls of light, and moving shafts of flame that take flight, causing fires, death, and destruction, as the substance seeks water.  If this sounds completely whacko, the plot is actually dumber than it sounds.

Denning and Watkins are detained by the Government, and begin working with the military, after everyone in a town near the lake is found dead.  Drake Industries, a mining company is responsible for releasing the unstable ""L6 lithium"", which could possible cause a nuclear reaction.  Despite the dangers, slimy Taylor Drake (Matthew Tompkins) the head of the company, is focused solely on profits, and is held back only by his scientific advisor Dr. Reign Palmer (Alex Meneses), his advisor and liaison with the Government.  Eventually it is determined that the detonation of explosives deep in the mine will make things safe, as matters wind up in a rather predictable fashion.

If you appreciate bad disaster flicks, Fire Down Below may just be a winner.  The premise is silly, and the awful dialog leads to some pretty terrible acting performances.  It's perfect for the Sy Fy Channel, where it has already been featured.  Perhaps you can catch it there before you decide to buy.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1338076800,9,2399,5.543956043956044

The story is set in Texas in the vicinity of Eustace and was actually filmed in Dallas, Eustace, and French Lick, Indiana; the caves are all in Indiana I imagine.

The movie is well paced and never seems to get too bogged down; the CGI is adequate and the sound is acceptable. The actors do a convincing job and I didn't have the problem with Jake that at least one of the reviewers did. By and large the overall acting is somewhat better than average for this sort of disaster flick.
