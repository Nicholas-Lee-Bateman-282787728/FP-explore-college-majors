2999532,5,B000XA5JWG,"I really enjoyed watching Queen. Halle Berry did a wonderful job in her role and showing all of us what biracial men and women went through during the slavery days. Queen was definitely a survivor. Everything she went through would have killed a weaker person, but she survived it all. What a wonderful tribute to Alex Haley and his family.",1201478400,,340,4.683333333333334
2999533,5,B000XA5JWG,"This is Halle Berry's best work yet. If this was a movie instead of a TV series, I'm sure she would have at least been nominated for Best Actress. I have now watched all the Roots episodes, as well as Roots; The Next Generations. This is a brilliant finale for Alex Haley's legacy. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in American history and/or genealogy.

By the way, get out the Kleenex. I rarely cry during movies, but I found myself sobbing during this one.",1200787200,2,469,4.517647058823529
2999534,5,B000XA5JWG,I love this movie I remember watching it when I was a teen I couldn't wait for the next episodes to watch it is really entertaining true story.,1200614400,2,143,4.142857142857143
2999535,5,B000XA5JWG,"I remember back when this aired on CBS in the early '90's.
Halle Berry plays the late Alex Haley's paternal grandmother,
the ever strong, fiery and resilient Queen!!--This story is
a tour de force and has an excellent supporting cast.
This was  Alex Haley's last work before he passed away a year
or two before this was first aired.
As I said, all of the cast shine in this and it makes a
great addition to your DVD collection and brilliantly caps
off the ""ROOTS"" saga!!",1200268800,57,470,4.465116279069767

2999566,5,B000XA5JWG,"The series begins with the friendly relationship between James Jackson Jr. (Tim Daly), the son of the plantation owner, and one of the slaves, Easter (Jasmine Guy), at the Jackson estate, known as Forks of Cypress, near Florence in northern Alabama. James and Easter have grown up together (within the social limits of the plantation culture), and gradually their feelings for each other have developed into romance. Easter is the daughter of an African-American house slave, Captain Jack (Paul Winfield), and his true love, Annie, another slave, who is part-Cherokee, and who is no longer on the Jackson property.

James Jackson Sr. (Martin Sheen), an Irish immigrant who has accumulated considerable wealth, becomes ill and soon dies. Minutes after the death James Jr. retreats to the comfort of the weaving house, where Easter was born, and where she lives and works. James and Easter make love, then, several months later, while they are alone, Easter reveals to him that she is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Sally Jackson (Ann-Margret), the new widow, encourages her son, James Jr., to marry the respectable and socially equal Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Perkins (Patricia Clarkson), who is an heiress to a cotton fortune as a daughter of a neighboring planter.

On April 8, 1841, Easter gives birth to a healthy girl. Excited about his new granddaughter, Captain Jack announces to the family and friends during dinner in the ""big house"" that a slave child has just been born, and he assures James, ""Easter's doing just fine"". That displeases Lizzie, who is present for the dinner, and who soon becomes James's fianc&eacute;e. Lizzie, having concluded that the new baby is James's child, excuses herself from the table and throws a fit. Moments later she vows to her mother (Charlotte Moore) that she'll never marry him, but her mother persuades her otherwise. Captain Jack begins to refer to the baby as Princess, but, when James enters the birth in the record book, he writes the name Queen. He also leaves blank the section for the name of the father.

Captain Jack begins to refer to the baby as Princess, but, when James enters the birth in the record book, he writes the name Queen. He also leaves blank the section for the name of the father.

James proposes marriage to Lizzie the next evening, Lizzie accepts, and the wedding takes place at the home sometime later. James continues to visit Easter at night, sometimes every night, during both his engagement and his marriage. Although James is Lizzie's husband, he is still in love with Easter. Later Lizzie learns that she has become pregnant. She and James welcome a daughter, Jane, whom Queen attends and serves. Although Jane and Queen are half-sisters, the family does not acknowledge that relationship (because of Queen's status as a slave).

James later persuades Easter to let Queen live in the main house, where she can receive training as a lady's maid. Both Easter and Lizzie oppose that plan, but James's word is final, so at age 5 Queen (Raven-Symon&eacute;) moves into the mansion. Jane and Queen grow up as friends and playmates. However, the other slave children tease and torment Queen because of her light skin and her ability to read and write. By 1860, several years later, the two young ladies, Queen (Halle Berry) and Jane (Jane Krakowski), have grown up, and they begin to attract the attention of the young men in Florence.

In the next year, 1861, Alabama secedes from the United States, the North declares war against the South, and James enters the Confederate Army and heads northward. While James rides away in a cavalry unit, Easter confirms to Queen that he is her ""pappy"". On July 21, 1861, during the First Battle of Bull Run, in Prince William County, Virginia, near Manassas, James sustains an injury which causes him to become discharged and sent back home. When James arrives at home, he learns that Jane, his legitimate daughter, has died during an epidemic of diphtheria, and he reaches the weaving house only moments after Easter too, with Queen beside her, dies of diphtheria.

Queen continues to serve the aging ladies, Sally and Lizzie, in the big house, and, in the absence of an overseer, takes over his function also, supervising the remaining field hands, after half of them left and went North.

Soon James forms a regiment, receives a promotion to the rank of colonel, and heads back into the war. Eventually the Union Army reaches Florence and the Jackson plantation, where the Northern soldiers loot and plunder, wantonly destroy property, insult the ladies and the slaves, and brutalize the slaves, for whose benefit they have claimed to fight the war to free them.

During another battle, Col. Jackson sustains another injury, which causes the amputation of his right arm without anesthesia of any type. Captain Jack dies as a free man, with Sally Jackson and Queen beside him.

Missus Jackson advises Queen to go wherever she might wish among the blacks, saying that there is no food and no place for her at the estate, and that she can expect no help from them, despite the known relationship between Queen and the Jackson family. Queen, however, strongly objects, insisting that the plantation is her home, and they are her family. Parson Dick (Ossie Davis), another slave there, warns Queen about the difficulties awaiting mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons in the new free society.

Mr. Henderson (Leo Burmester), the former overseer, and his wife (Linda Hart) have left the Jackson plantation, and they now run a nearby grocery store, where young redneck white men hang out, and James trades. Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, however, freely insult James and Queen.

After an unpleasant confrontation at the store with Mrs. Henderson and with several of the tough young white men, Queen runs away and hides until the next morning, then, tired and hungry, she returns home. Queen and Lizzie exchange unkind words, and Queen leaves. While Queen pauses at the grave of her mother, Missus Jackson bids her goodbye and hands her a sum of money. James and Queen meet on the driveway in the front of the house as James returns from a long search for Queen that morning. They speak briefly, then Queen continues walking away.

Queen realizes in Florence how easily she can ""pass"" as a white lady, so she resolves to do so; there she buys a one-way ticket and rides one or more horse-drawn stagecoaches (on an unlikely journey) to Charleston, South Carolina.

At a charitable soup kitchen Queen meets Alice (Lonette McKee), another fair-skinned young ""colored"" lady who also passes as white. Alice befriends Queen, takes her into her apartment, cleans her up, teaches her about passing, and takes her to a white dance hall, where she meets Alice's white gentleman friend, George (Dan Biggers), who gets Queen a job in a flower shop.

While at work Queen meets Digby (Victor Garber), an injured former Confederate soldier, who quickly falls for her and soon proposes to her. Queen accepts, then tells Alice, who insists that such a marriage would be foolish and strongly urges Queen to break the engagement.

Queen, nave and strong-willed, decides to go to Digby's apartment, intending to break off. Digby, after a surprising twist, begins to seduce Queen with some help from a dose of laudanum. While Queen objects and resists, she blurts out that she is a Negro. Digby then flies into a rage, beats her, rapes her, and throws her out.

Queen returns to Alice, who also throws her out, to protect her own position and reputation. The next day, after a miserable night in a camp of black homeless people, Queen staggers into a meeting of a black church, where she receives much help from a kindly woman, who later takes her to the home of two self-righteous and sanctimonious spinsters, Misses Mandy (Sada Thompson) and Giffery, who hire Queen as a live-in maid.

A few days later Davis (Dennis Haysbert), a gardener and a former slave, arrives in the backyard in search of work. Queen and Davis start a friendship, which turns into romance and results in pregnancy. Queen first seeks an abortion, then she decides to keep the child, so she confronts Davis, who invites her to meet him at the railway station, presumably to head north.

Although Queen waits at the station well into the evening, Davis fails to appear, so she dejectedly returns to the old maids. Creepy religious dried up old lesbian dinosaurs try to take Queen's child as their own, as any sick lesbian couple has been known to do over the centuries. Calling themselves God's taskmasters. Nevertheless, Miss Mandy labels her as a wicked, naughty girl and a fallen sinner, but she and Miss Giffery allow her to remain. In due time the two spinsters, acting as midwives, attend the birth of a healthy boy. Queen wants to give him the name David, but the two old lesbian sick skanks prefer the name Abner. A white minister christens the baby, predictably, as Abner. Lesbian skanks misses Mandy and Giffery increasingly take over Abner, apparently intending to raise him as though he were their own. Eventually one night Queen flees and heads north with six-month-old Abner in her arms.

At a crossroads store and lunchroom Queen meets Mrs. Benson (Frances Conroy), an upper-middle-class white mother of a 15-month-old son, for whom she needs a wet nurse. They ride away toward the Benson home, in Beaufort, South Carolina, which is south, not north, of Charleston (and which is on the way to Savannah, Georgia, but not on a direct way to Savannah, Tennessee, Queen's destination).

When Queen and Mrs. Benson arrive in Beaufort, they meet Mr. Benson (Richard Jenkins) amid a crowd of angry black former slaves, striking for more pay and more respect, under the vocal persuasion and agitation of Davis, the father of Abner. Later Queen finds Davis, confronts him, berates him for having abandoned her and Abner, then shares his bed until the next morning.

Mrs. Benson deceives Queen and uses her and Abner in such a way as to enable Mr. Benson, a leader among the local Ku Klux Klan, to find and capture Davis. Mrs. Benson, feigning concern for the security of Davis, urges Queen to leave Abner with her in safety and to hurry to Davis and warn him that he is in imminent danger of a ""terrible work"" of the Klan. Queen goes, and a Klansman follows. When Queen returns to the Benson home, she learns that Abner is absent, and Mrs. Benson says that Abner ""is doing God's work tonight"". The next morning Queen goes to Davis' cabin, where she finds his hanged and charred body, along with Abner, inside a wooden chicken cage at his father's feet.

In the next scene Queen and Abner, now a toddler of about two years, walk together and, near Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee, board a small wooden ferryboat, where they meet Alec Haley (Danny Glover), who operates the ferry, along with his son, Henry (Kenny Blank). While crossing a river Alec asks Queen where she wishes to go, and she answers, ""North"". Alec senses the general nature of Queen's situation and her motive.

Alec gently persuades Queen to ride back to the south side, saying that in the North she would find only ""cold weather and cold-hearted Yankees"", so Queen acquiesces. Soon Alec introduces Queen to Dora (Madge Sinclair), the cook in the home of Mr. Cherry (George Grizzard), a widower, where she gets a job as a maid.

Queen, brooding over her regrettable experiences, adopts a defensive and disagreeable attitude, which becomes obvious to everyone around her. Dora tells her, ""It's high time you figure out who your friends are, Missy"", and Mr. Cherry tells her, ""You are the most ornery maid I've ever had"". Later Alec describes her to herself as ""never talking peaceable to a living soul"" and ""hating the world for whatever the world done to you"". However, Queen responds to those helpful words by allowing a friendship to develop between Alec and herself and by changing her attitudes. Soon Mr. Cherry comments, ""She really lights up this old place when she smiles"", and suggests, ""Let's just hope it continues"".

The relationship between Queen and Alec grows into romance, which results not only in a wedding, in which Mr. Cherry gives the bride away, but also, eventually, the birth of another child, whom Queen names as Simon. Queen expresses high hopes for Simon's future, and she predicts that he'll become ""magnificent"".

When Simon (Jussie Smollett) completes the sixth grade, the point at which black boys in the South typically (in the subject setting) drop out of school to start full-time work in the fields, as did Henry and Abner, Simon's teacher comments to Queen that he is ""the best student in the district"". Alec vigorously argues with Queen against Simon's staying in school, but Queen presents persuasive logic, and he eventually agrees to ""waste"" one of the three boys. [In the US high schools did not generally exist until about 1910, and they started in the larger, wealthy cities.]

One day Queen takes Abner and Simon back to the Forks of Cypress, the Jackson plantation, to show them where she was raised and to share her memories of her childhood. When they arrive there, the funeral for James Jackson, her father, takes place, and she pays her respect from a distance. Queen then shows her sons the weaving house, where she lived as a girl, along with her mother Easter's grave and the Jackson mansion. Inside the house Lizzie Jackson accosts her bitterly and tells her that she does not belong there, as the mansion was never truly her home. Queen quickly leaves, feeling again sad and rejected by the white side of her family.

In due time Simon becomes the first black boy in Savannah to complete grade school, and, after another major disagreement at home, Simon begins making plans to go to the normal school in Memphis, Tennessee.

Further, Abner announces that he too wishes to go out into the world to make his own way. Alec reluctantly consents, but Queen strongly objects, likely due in part to her bitter memories of the time when the two spinsters in Charleston tried to take Abner away from her.

That confrontation leads to a conflict among Queen on one hand and Alec and Abner on the other, in which Queen emotionally reveals to Abner that Alec is not his real father. Still feeling upset and agitated and allowing her feelings to divert her attention, while stoking the wood-fired cast-iron cookstove, Queen causes or allows a flame to start a fire, which in turn ignites her long dress. Queen runs out of the house and into the surrounding woodland. The fire in the dress dies out, and Queen sustains only minimal physical injuries. However, undoubtedly recalling the frightful scene in which she discovered the charred and strangled body of Davis hanging from a noose, Queen experiences an emotional, mental, or psychological trauma, which then causes Alec to commit her to a mental-health institution, in Jackson, Tennessee, about 50 miles from home.

Alec realizes, and he says to Queen and Abner separately, that Queen's psychological problems result from certain events in her life which she's never discussed with Alec or anyone else.

After several weeks in the depressing ""lunatic asylum"", someone on the staff sends a request from Queen to Mr. Cherry to visit her. During a meeting at the hospital Queen politely and humbly tells her former employer about Abner's wish to ""find his own place in the world"". But Queen and Alec have already given all their cash to Simon for his schooling, so Queen asks Mr. Cherry for a loan of $50, which he graciously agrees to make. Queen tearfully thanks him and compliantly returns to her room.

Soon Queen decides that she needs to go home, so that she can see her sons when they leave, and she convinces the man in charge that the time is right. Alec picks her up and takes her home in a wagon. Queen and Alec take Abner and Simon on the ferryboat across the Tennessee River and, on the west side of the stream, they place their sons aboard a carriage bound for Memphis, about 116 miles due west of Savannah. [In truth at the time of the applicable setting there was in Memphis no normal school which enrolled black students; Simon actually went to Lane College, a black school in Jackson, Tennessee, where he met and began to court Bertha George Palmer, from Henning, Tennessee.]

Back at home the aging couple sit on the front porch, and Queen starts to tell Alec about her life, starting with her time as a slave girl with Jane at the Jackson plantation.",1470355200,,18353,4.87271561397884

Every actor gives a stellar performance and the dialogue is flawless.  It is a must see.  I have always felt that there are a few TV movies that have a quality that would have easily help up in a movie theater setting- this is one of them.  Now, we take for granted that Television provides high-quality content that rivals the theaters, but back then, to have a movie of this caliber be shown on the small screen was a big deal.  I feel so disappointed that so many people are unaware of this gem.  It is a MUST SEE.

I have the movie on VHS, and have been waiting for years to have it available on DVD.  Now, Amazon offers it on its streaming services at a very reasonable price.  I purchased it the moment it came available and now I can watch this beautiful movie anywhere!",1432857600,,922,4.313953488372093

2999709,5,B000XA5JWG,"First off, let me just address the erroneous notion that ""all the parts are not there"".  You have to pay attention when you get to the disc menu, as it gives options for Episode 1 & Episode 2.

That out of the way, I must say that I really enjoyed this last recorded masterpiece from the late Alex Haley; he is the one who got me interested in my own family history and genealogy, what with the thorough way he tracked not only his mother's side of the family, but also his father's.  Halle Berry does an excellent job as the title character, perfectly conveying her struggles, her hopes, her dreams, her fears, and her courage as a biracial black woman in the 19th century South.  In a world that demeaned African Americans, Queen fought to be seen, heard, and, above all, respected.  There are several emotional scenes that take place throughout the movie, and they can be hard to watch.  Yet, it also gives one a sense of pride because despite all that befell those men and women, the evil slave owners and those who adopted similar attitudes and views toward black people could not break their spirit.",1384732800,12,1105,4.527638190954774

2999714,5,B000XA5JWG,This was the telling of the maternal side of Alex Haley family. Queen played by Halle Berry was phenomenal. I believe it was her best role yet! It told of her struggles trying to fit in. She was the daughter of a hush relationship between a slave and the white master. She was very naive about how the white ancestors felt about her. Her black ancestors died right before slavery was abolished. When she did not receive the love she thought she deserved she decided to leave the plantation. The only home she knew. After many trials and antics she finally settled into a small town as a maid. It was with that job that she eventually found the man she would marry and later have more children with. This led to Alex Haley. This is truly a must see!,1376956800,4,748,4.35

2999740,5,B000XA5JWG,"I highly recommend reading Roots and Queen before watching the mini-series made from them.  Both of these books/mini-series should be mandatory for kids in High School, so they can really understand the effects of slavery on African-American's.

2999821,5,B000XA5JWG,"I've loved this movie ever since it first aired all those years ago on CBS. I bought the VHS 3-pack from Columbia House (remember them?!) as soon as it was available. And when that collection was near the end of its lifespan, I snapped it up the first week it was released on DVD!! (btw, EVERY episode is in this collection. The first two episodes are on the first disc under ""episodes""!!! It's not very well designed, admittedly.)

I pop this movie in at least once a year because of the highly original storyline, the superb acting of Ms. Berry (her BEST PERFORMANCE EVER) and all involved, as well as the sumptuously shot imagery that abounds throughout this fim. I also love to see the future  stars like a young Jane Krakowski to the Allstate guy in their ""hungrier"" years!! There's no other film like it. It's message is a good reminder that life has been hard since the beginning of mankind but there are many who choose to survive it inspite of that fact.

The mini series is a condensed version of the book. As with every book, a film version will never capture what a novel can. They're different mediums. It's a good read and will take you back to Ireland, explain the relationship Cap'n Jack had with his master, and also the tragic history of Easter's mom, Annie. David Stevens co-wrote the book with Alex Haley AND wrote the screenplay after Haley's death, so I'm sure any changes/omissions were made with careful consideration.

Tim Daly as the plantation owner who was caught up between his love for the illegitimate child he was not allowed to claim and the times he lived in... his character was believable, and you felt for him. Not some one-dimensional flat second-tier character as so many writers lazily throw in nowadays. Oh, you hated his wife, even though you understood her at times as well...

I make period costumes and when this came to Charleston SC (Boone Hall is the main house....and all other locations are around Charleston) I got hired. It was like working on 3 films at once and starts in the 1830's going up to the 1880's. What a dream project! I made many of Ms Berrie's gowns....though most are not spectacular frilly frocks of course. I still have the stays I made for her (you can just catch a glimpse of them in the scene where she is raped) I also did Danny Glover's clothes, but of course there's nothing fancy there too. Also many things for many other characters as well. It was a great project and the designer Helen Butler was wonderful to work for.

An interesting note.... the yellow gown Jasmine Guy wears to the infamous double wedding is a REAL 1830's gown. Ms Guy is so tiny she could (with stays) fit into it. It was all hand sewn (no sewing machines 'til the 1840's y'know) and made of a beautiful mull (gauze cotton) printed in yellow swirls....a hundred and sixty years old (at the time of shooting)

i have the DVD, i have no issue with it.great quality as always from amazon!
so for me?
i see no issue with the dvd. i'm actually making copies for my amiga tonight.
Justlove it.

TIM DALY,and JASMINE GUY= muy caliente,so very hot,and a ""real""natural attraction clearly.and i love how he took her to the dance,and or was there with his""date"" but really was desiring her,so much since really day one,of meeting her as his slave,just was so beautiful in the beginning,until later he became a big jerk! lol
Due to his upbringing.his father wanted him to just get married to LIZZIE,who he did not really even LOVE! let alone be IN LOVE WITH,not even close to how he love QUEEN MOTHER ""easter...""

I just love this movie and watch 100x,since it first aired,and i will be watching again this winter into winter 2013. . . 1 OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOVE SCENES EVER!
i love tim daly,so good looking,and IMO a really great actor,under-rated he is.

i watch this INCREDIBLE Sad yet touching movie true to life
 way before my time i love ALL ALEX HALEY RIP Movies. TIM DALY even today is still
very sexy beautiful hombre...a great actor and was Smokin'Hot with jasmine guy in
this movie,they were great real chemistry came across from their first scene.
Until well,he became a jerk toward the end and really ignore his own child et.
i really love how she dealt with later on the whole mixed black white problem.
She got raped then has to deal with white women jealousy of
her,even her own black people at times. Sad.
.
but i love her Strong woman-Strength toward the end best,
really enjoying her scenes though throughout it all.
i did love how she did ""realize:""later on where she her son etc belong &
finally was truly ""loved""in the end.i love her scenes with her ""father"" tim daly,he is such a good actor in this.so good looking.i love the way he did adore her lovely Mother""easter"" but just not enough to Marry her back then etc.as marrying a woman whose white who clearly he might have love somewhat,but NOT at all as MUCH as the lovely black woman/slave Easter who born his child.i love each part but mainly with that handsome sexy good looking ACTOR TIM DALY i love him in ""each scene""with pretty and the talented ""whitley""from a different world actress Jasmine GUY! love it all,
.
and also ann magaret a VERY great actress in this and few other movies i see her in danny glover is good too as my fave bella halle so beautifully talented she is really an amazing woman actress love her to death. i can envision each time watching ROOTS  this as being Alex Haley grandmother on his father side,that is how GREAT! her acting is etc just enjoying the whole cast did superb like Martin Sheen in this classic too! the best movies are back in the day on our heritage slavery etc. true life stories are best drama etc. in my opinion. Lonette Mckee lovely self was also in this as alice.

I enjoy her films too t.v.shows etcd.
i just lOVE ALL ALEX HALEY Saga.have the whole collection, i can easily give as all of ROOTS movies etc. now queen 10 stars,.seen it 1st on television in the mid to late 1990s.i love this film

To respond to some concerns about the DVD, they did not leave any parts of the movie out. When the first episode ends, be sure to go to the main menu and choose Episode two. That will show the parts of the film that people say are missing.

I must say that I have not finished reading the original novel (it is quite long and difficult to complete given the fact the first few chapters date back to Ireland).  But this movie version is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Halle Berry as Queen, in her first role as a truly credible and outstanding lead actress, was FLAWLESS.  Every line, EVERY SINGLE LINE of dialogue was delivered effortlessly and with almost deadly precision.  I first watched Queen when it debuted as a mini-series but I was quite young and did not fully grasp the concepts.  But as an adult, this story totally enveloped me.  And as Queen's life unfolded, I felt as though a part of me opened as well.

All the actors did an outstanding job, particularly Ann-Margaret, Tim Daly, and the ever-radiant Jasmine Guy as Queen's slave-born mother.  It is a long movie and can become emotionally taxing, but if you can spare it, all 283 minutes are worth the time.",1202428800,58,961,4.740963855421687

3234063,5,B000XA5JWG,"The series begins with the friendly relationship between James Jackson Jr. (Tim Daly), the son of the plantation owner, and one of the slaves, Easter (Jasmine Guy), at the Jackson estate, known as Forks of Cypress, near Florence in northern Alabama. James and Easter have grown up together (within the social limits of the plantation culture), and gradually their feelings for each other have developed into romance. Easter is the daughter of an African-American house slave, Captain Jack (Paul Winfield), and his true love, Annie, another slave, who is part-Cherokee, and who is no longer on the Jackson property.

James Jackson Sr. (Martin Sheen), an Irish immigrant who has accumulated considerable wealth, becomes ill and soon dies. Minutes after the death James Jr. retreats to the comfort of the weaving house, where Easter was born, and where she lives and works. James and Easter make love, then, several months later, while they are alone, Easter reveals to him that she is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Sally Jackson (Ann-Margret), the new widow, encourages her son, James Jr., to marry the respectable and socially equal Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Perkins (Patricia Clarkson), who is an heiress to a cotton fortune as a daughter of a neighboring planter.

On April 8, 1841, Easter gives birth to a healthy girl. Excited about his new granddaughter, Captain Jack announces to the family and friends during dinner in the ""big house"" that a slave child has just been born, and he assures James, ""Easter's doing just fine"". That displeases Lizzie, who is present for the dinner, and who soon becomes James's fianc&eacute;e. Lizzie, having concluded that the new baby is James's child, excuses herself from the table and throws a fit. Moments later she vows to her mother (Charlotte Moore) that she'll never marry him, but her mother persuades her otherwise. Captain Jack begins to refer to the baby as Princess, but, when James enters the birth in the record book, he writes the name Queen. He also leaves blank the section for the name of the father.

Captain Jack begins to refer to the baby as Princess, but, when James enters the birth in the record book, he writes the name Queen. He also leaves blank the section for the name of the father.

James proposes marriage to Lizzie the next evening, Lizzie accepts, and the wedding takes place at the home sometime later. James continues to visit Easter at night, sometimes every night, during both his engagement and his marriage. Although James is Lizzie's husband, he is still in love with Easter. Later Lizzie learns that she has become pregnant. She and James welcome a daughter, Jane, whom Queen attends and serves. Although Jane and Queen are half-sisters, the family does not acknowledge that relationship (because of Queen's status as a slave).

James later persuades Easter to let Queen live in the main house, where she can receive training as a lady's maid. Both Easter and Lizzie oppose that plan, but James's word is final, so at age 5 Queen (Raven-Symon&eacute;) moves into the mansion. Jane and Queen grow up as friends and playmates. However, the other slave children tease and torment Queen because of her light skin and her ability to read and write. By 1860, several years later, the two young ladies, Queen (Halle Berry) and Jane (Jane Krakowski), have grown up, and they begin to attract the attention of the young men in Florence.

In the next year, 1861, Alabama secedes from the United States, the North declares war against the South, and James enters the Confederate Army and heads northward. While James rides away in a cavalry unit, Easter confirms to Queen that he is her ""pappy"". On July 21, 1861, during the First Battle of Bull Run, in Prince William County, Virginia, near Manassas, James sustains an injury which causes him to become discharged and sent back home. When James arrives at home, he learns that Jane, his legitimate daughter, has died during an epidemic of diphtheria, and he reaches the weaving house only moments after Easter too, with Queen beside her, dies of diphtheria.

Queen continues to serve the aging ladies, Sally and Lizzie, in the big house, and, in the absence of an overseer, takes over his function also, supervising the remaining field hands, after half of them left and went North.

Soon James forms a regiment, receives a promotion to the rank of colonel, and heads back into the war. Eventually the Union Army reaches Florence and the Jackson plantation, where the Northern soldiers loot and plunder, wantonly destroy property, insult the ladies and the slaves, and brutalize the slaves, for whose benefit they have claimed to fight the war to free them.

During another battle, Col. Jackson sustains another injury, which causes the amputation of his right arm without anesthesia of any type. Captain Jack dies as a free man, with Sally Jackson and Queen beside him.

Missus Jackson advises Queen to go wherever she might wish among the blacks, saying that there is no food and no place for her at the estate, and that she can expect no help from them, despite the known relationship between Queen and the Jackson family. Queen, however, strongly objects, insisting that the plantation is her home, and they are her family. Parson Dick (Ossie Davis), another slave there, warns Queen about the difficulties awaiting mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons in the new free society.

Mr. Henderson (Leo Burmester), the former overseer, and his wife (Linda Hart) have left the Jackson plantation, and they now run a nearby grocery store, where young redneck white men hang out, and James trades. Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, however, freely insult James and Queen.

After an unpleasant confrontation at the store with Mrs. Henderson and with several of the tough young white men, Queen runs away and hides until the next morning, then, tired and hungry, she returns home. Queen and Lizzie exchange unkind words, and Queen leaves. While Queen pauses at the grave of her mother, Missus Jackson bids her goodbye and hands her a sum of money. James and Queen meet on the driveway in the front of the house as James returns from a long search for Queen that morning. They speak briefly, then Queen continues walking away.

Queen realizes in Florence how easily she can ""pass"" as a white lady, so she resolves to do so; there she buys a one-way ticket and rides one or more horse-drawn stagecoaches (on an unlikely journey) to Charleston, South Carolina.

At a charitable soup kitchen Queen meets Alice (Lonette McKee), another fair-skinned young ""colored"" lady who also passes as white. Alice befriends Queen, takes her into her apartment, cleans her up, teaches her about passing, and takes her to a white dance hall, where she meets Alice's white gentleman friend, George (Dan Biggers), who gets Queen a job in a flower shop.

While at work Queen meets Digby (Victor Garber), an injured former Confederate soldier, who quickly falls for her and soon proposes to her. Queen accepts, then tells Alice, who insists that such a marriage would be foolish and strongly urges Queen to break the engagement.

Queen, nave and strong-willed, decides to go to Digby's apartment, intending to break off. Digby, after a surprising twist, begins to seduce Queen with some help from a dose of laudanum. While Queen objects and resists, she blurts out that she is a Negro. Digby then flies into a rage, beats her, rapes her, and throws her out.

Queen returns to Alice, who also throws her out, to protect her own position and reputation. The next day, after a miserable night in a camp of black homeless people, Queen staggers into a meeting of a black church, where she receives much help from a kindly woman, who later takes her to the home of two self-righteous and sanctimonious spinsters, Misses Mandy (Sada Thompson) and Giffery, who hire Queen as a live-in maid.

A few days later Davis (Dennis Haysbert), a gardener and a former slave, arrives in the backyard in search of work. Queen and Davis start a friendship, which turns into romance and results in pregnancy. Queen first seeks an abortion, then she decides to keep the child, so she confronts Davis, who invites her to meet him at the railway station, presumably to head north.

Although Queen waits at the station well into the evening, Davis fails to appear, so she dejectedly returns to the old maids. Creepy religious dried up old lesbian dinosaurs try to take Queen's child as their own, as any sick lesbian couple has been known to do over the centuries. Calling themselves God's taskmasters. Nevertheless, Miss Mandy labels her as a wicked, naughty girl and a fallen sinner, but she and Miss Giffery allow her to remain. In due time the two spinsters, acting as midwives, attend the birth of a healthy boy. Queen wants to give him the name David, but the two old lesbian sick skanks prefer the name Abner. A white minister christens the baby, predictably, as Abner. Lesbian skanks misses Mandy and Giffery increasingly take over Abner, apparently intending to raise him as though he were their own. Eventually one night Queen flees and heads north with six-month-old Abner in her arms.

At a crossroads store and lunchroom Queen meets Mrs. Benson (Frances Conroy), an upper-middle-class white mother of a 15-month-old son, for whom she needs a wet nurse. They ride away toward the Benson home, in Beaufort, South Carolina, which is south, not north, of Charleston (and which is on the way to Savannah, Georgia, but not on a direct way to Savannah, Tennessee, Queen's destination).

When Queen and Mrs. Benson arrive in Beaufort, they meet Mr. Benson (Richard Jenkins) amid a crowd of angry black former slaves, striking for more pay and more respect, under the vocal persuasion and agitation of Davis, the father of Abner. Later Queen finds Davis, confronts him, berates him for having abandoned her and Abner, then shares his bed until the next morning.

Mrs. Benson deceives Queen and uses her and Abner in such a way as to enable Mr. Benson, a leader among the local Ku Klux Klan, to find and capture Davis. Mrs. Benson, feigning concern for the security of Davis, urges Queen to leave Abner with her in safety and to hurry to Davis and warn him that he is in imminent danger of a ""terrible work"" of the Klan. Queen goes, and a Klansman follows. When Queen returns to the Benson home, she learns that Abner is absent, and Mrs. Benson says that Abner ""is doing God's work tonight"". The next morning Queen goes to Davis' cabin, where she finds his hanged and charred body, along with Abner, inside a wooden chicken cage at his father's feet.

In the next scene Queen and Abner, now a toddler of about two years, walk together and, near Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee, board a small wooden ferryboat, where they meet Alec Haley (Danny Glover), who operates the ferry, along with his son, Henry (Kenny Blank). While crossing a river Alec asks Queen where she wishes to go, and she answers, ""North"". Alec senses the general nature of Queen's situation and her motive.

Alec gently persuades Queen to ride back to the south side, saying that in the North she would find only ""cold weather and cold-hearted Yankees"", so Queen acquiesces. Soon Alec introduces Queen to Dora (Madge Sinclair), the cook in the home of Mr. Cherry (George Grizzard), a widower, where she gets a job as a maid.

Queen, brooding over her regrettable experiences, adopts a defensive and disagreeable attitude, which becomes obvious to everyone around her. Dora tells her, ""It's high time you figure out who your friends are, Missy"", and Mr. Cherry tells her, ""You are the most ornery maid I've ever had"". Later Alec describes her to herself as ""never talking peaceable to a living soul"" and ""hating the world for whatever the world done to you"". However, Queen responds to those helpful words by allowing a friendship to develop between Alec and herself and by changing her attitudes. Soon Mr. Cherry comments, ""She really lights up this old place when she smiles"", and suggests, ""Let's just hope it continues"".

The relationship between Queen and Alec grows into romance, which results not only in a wedding, in which Mr. Cherry gives the bride away, but also, eventually, the birth of another child, whom Queen names as Simon. Queen expresses high hopes for Simon's future, and she predicts that he'll become ""magnificent"".

When Simon (Jussie Smollett) completes the sixth grade, the point at which black boys in the South typically (in the subject setting) drop out of school to start full-time work in the fields, as did Henry and Abner, Simon's teacher comments to Queen that he is ""the best student in the district"". Alec vigorously argues with Queen against Simon's staying in school, but Queen presents persuasive logic, and he eventually agrees to ""waste"" one of the three boys. [In the US high schools did not generally exist until about 1910, and they started in the larger, wealthy cities.]

One day Queen takes Abner and Simon back to the Forks of Cypress, the Jackson plantation, to show them where she was raised and to share her memories of her childhood. When they arrive there, the funeral for James Jackson, her father, takes place, and she pays her respect from a distance. Queen then shows her sons the weaving house, where she lived as a girl, along with her mother Easter's grave and the Jackson mansion. Inside the house Lizzie Jackson accosts her bitterly and tells her that she does not belong there, as the mansion was never truly her home. Queen quickly leaves, feeling again sad and rejected by the white side of her family.

In due time Simon becomes the first black boy in Savannah to complete grade school, and, after another major disagreement at home, Simon begins making plans to go to the normal school in Memphis, Tennessee.

Further, Abner announces that he too wishes to go out into the world to make his own way. Alec reluctantly consents, but Queen strongly objects, likely due in part to her bitter memories of the time when the two spinsters in Charleston tried to take Abner away from her.

That confrontation leads to a conflict among Queen on one hand and Alec and Abner on the other, in which Queen emotionally reveals to Abner that Alec is not his real father. Still feeling upset and agitated and allowing her feelings to divert her attention, while stoking the wood-fired cast-iron cookstove, Queen causes or allows a flame to start a fire, which in turn ignites her long dress. Queen runs out of the house and into the surrounding woodland. The fire in the dress dies out, and Queen sustains only minimal physical injuries. However, undoubtedly recalling the frightful scene in which she discovered the charred and strangled body of Davis hanging from a noose, Queen experiences an emotional, mental, or psychological trauma, which then causes Alec to commit her to a mental-health institution, in Jackson, Tennessee, about 50 miles from home.

Alec realizes, and he says to Queen and Abner separately, that Queen's psychological problems result from certain events in her life which she's never discussed with Alec or anyone else.

After several weeks in the depressing ""lunatic asylum"", someone on the staff sends a request from Queen to Mr. Cherry to visit her. During a meeting at the hospital Queen politely and humbly tells her former employer about Abner's wish to ""find his own place in the world"". But Queen and Alec have already given all their cash to Simon for his schooling, so Queen asks Mr. Cherry for a loan of $50, which he graciously agrees to make. Queen tearfully thanks him and compliantly returns to her room.

Soon Queen decides that she needs to go home, so that she can see her sons when they leave, and she convinces the man in charge that the time is right. Alec picks her up and takes her home in a wagon. Queen and Alec take Abner and Simon on the ferryboat across the Tennessee River and, on the west side of the stream, they place their sons aboard a carriage bound for Memphis, about 116 miles due west of Savannah. [In truth at the time of the applicable setting there was in Memphis no normal school which enrolled black students; Simon actually went to Lane College, a black school in Jackson, Tennessee, where he met and began to court Bertha George Palmer, from Henning, Tennessee.]

Back at home the aging couple sit on the front porch, and Queen starts to tell Alec about her life, starting with her time as a slave girl with Jane at the Jackson plantation.",1470355200,,18353,4.87271561397884

Every actor gives a stellar performance and the dialogue is flawless.  It is a must see.  I have always felt that there are a few TV movies that have a quality that would have easily help up in a movie theater setting- this is one of them.  Now, we take for granted that Television provides high-quality content that rivals the theaters, but back then, to have a movie of this caliber be shown on the small screen was a big deal.  I feel so disappointed that so many people are unaware of this gem.  It is a MUST SEE.

3234206,5,B000XA5JWG,"First off, let me just address the erroneous notion that ""all the parts are not there"".  You have to pay attention when you get to the disc menu, as it gives options for Episode 1 & Episode 2.

That out of the way, I must say that I really enjoyed this last recorded masterpiece from the late Alex Haley; he is the one who got me interested in my own family history and genealogy, what with the thorough way he tracked not only his mother's side of the family, but also his father's.  Halle Berry does an excellent job as the title character, perfectly conveying her struggles, her hopes, her dreams, her fears, and her courage as a biracial black woman in the 19th century South.  In a world that demeaned African Americans, Queen fought to be seen, heard, and, above all, respected.  There are several emotional scenes that take place throughout the movie, and they can be hard to watch.  Yet, it also gives one a sense of pride because despite all that befell those men and women, the evil slave owners and those who adopted similar attitudes and views toward black people could not break their spirit.",1384732800,12,1105,4.527638190954774

3234210,3,B000XA5JWG,This is a good documentary to some degree.  I think this of story has out lived itself.  Just bought it to see how it related to Roots.,1378339200,,135,3.962962962962963
3234211,5,B000XA5JWG,This was the telling of the maternal side of Alex Haley family. Queen played by Halle Berry was phenomenal. I believe it was her best role yet! It told of her struggles trying to fit in. She was the daughter of a hush relationship between a slave and the white master. She was very naive about how the white ancestors felt about her. Her black ancestors died right before slavery was abolished. When she did not receive the love she thought she deserved she decided to leave the plantation. The only home she knew. After many trials and antics she finally settled into a small town as a maid. It was with that job that she eventually found the man she would marry and later have more children with. This led to Alex Haley. This is truly a must see!,1376956800,4,748,4.35
3234232,5,B000XA5JWG,This is such an amazing movie...depicting some of the struggles African American had to still face after slavery somewhat ended.,1375747200,2,128,5.45

3234237,5,B000XA5JWG,"I highly recommend reading Roots and Queen before watching the mini-series made from them.  Both of these books/mini-series should be mandatory for kids in High School, so they can really understand the effects of slavery on African-American's.

3234318,5,B000XA5JWG,"I've loved this movie ever since it first aired all those years ago on CBS. I bought the VHS 3-pack from Columbia House (remember them?!) as soon as it was available. And when that collection was near the end of its lifespan, I snapped it up the first week it was released on DVD!! (btw, EVERY episode is in this collection. The first two episodes are on the first disc under ""episodes""!!! It's not very well designed, admittedly.)

I pop this movie in at least once a year because of the highly original storyline, the superb acting of Ms. Berry (her BEST PERFORMANCE EVER) and all involved, as well as the sumptuously shot imagery that abounds throughout this fim. I also love to see the future  stars like a young Jane Krakowski to the Allstate guy in their ""hungrier"" years!! There's no other film like it. It's message is a good reminder that life has been hard since the beginning of mankind but there are many who choose to survive it inspite of that fact.

The mini series is a condensed version of the book. As with every book, a film version will never capture what a novel can. They're different mediums. It's a good read and will take you back to Ireland, explain the relationship Cap'n Jack had with his master, and also the tragic history of Easter's mom, Annie. David Stevens co-wrote the book with Alex Haley AND wrote the screenplay after Haley's death, so I'm sure any changes/omissions were made with careful consideration.

I share this movie with as many people as I can, and everyone loves it and wonders why they've never heard of it before. So, spread the word that ""Queen"" is ready and waiting to inspire people of all persuasions and generations.",1339977600,6,1672,4.600671140939597

I am not a fan of the movie ""Roots"", but, this one I adored. The characters were so engaging from the start. Tim Daly as the plantation owner who was caught up between his love for the illegitimate child he was not allowed to claim and the times he lived in... his character was believable, and you felt for him. Not some one-dimensional flat second-tier character as so many writers lazily throw in nowadays. Oh, you hated his wife, even though you understood her at times as well...

3234348,5,B000XA5JWG,"....so I am biased but this is a great story, told completely.

I make period costumes and when this came to Charleston SC (Boone Hall is the main house....and all other locations are around Charleston) I got hired. It was like working on 3 films at once and starts in the 1830's going up to the 1880's. What a dream project! I made many of Ms Berrie's gowns....though most are not spectacular frilly frocks of course. I still have the stays I made for her (you can just catch a glimpse of them in the scene where she is raped) I also did Danny Glover's clothes, but of course there's nothing fancy there too. Also many things for many other characters as well. It was a great project and the designer Helen Butler was wonderful to work for.

An interesting note.... the yellow gown Jasmine Guy wears to the infamous double wedding is a REAL 1830's gown. Ms Guy is so tiny she could (with stays) fit into it. It was all hand sewn (no sewing machines 'til the 1840's y'know) and made of a beautiful mull (gauze cotton) printed in yellow swirls....a hundred and sixty years old (at the time of shooting)

There... some things to look for when you're viewing this expansive narrative. Have fun, y'all!",1258416000,7,1198,4.486238532110092

i see no issue with the dvd. i'm actually making copies for my amiga tonight.
Justlove it.

TIM DALY,and JASMINE GUY= muy caliente,so very hot,and a ""real""natural attraction clearly.and i love how he took her to the dance,and or was there with his""date"" but really was desiring her,so much since really day one,of meeting her as his slave,just was so beautiful in the beginning,until later he became a big jerk! lol
Due to his upbringing.his father wanted him to just get married to LIZZIE,who he did not really even LOVE! let alone be IN LOVE WITH,not even close to how he love QUEEN MOTHER ""easter...""

I just love this movie and watch 100x,since it first aired,and i will be watching again this winter into winter 2013. . . 1 OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOVE SCENES EVER!
i love tim daly,so good looking,and IMO a really great actor,under-rated he is.

i watch this INCREDIBLE Sad yet touching movie true to life
 way before my time i love ALL ALEX HALEY RIP Movies. TIM DALY even today is still
very sexy beautiful hombre...a great actor and was Smokin'Hot with jasmine guy in
this movie,they were great real chemistry came across from their first scene.
Until well,he became a jerk toward the end and really ignore his own child et.
i really love how she dealt with later on the whole mixed black white problem.
She got raped then has to deal with white women jealousy of
her,even her own black people at times. Sad.
.
but i love her Strong woman-Strength toward the end best,
really enjoying her scenes though throughout it all.
i did love how she did ""realize:""later on where she her son etc belong &
finally was truly ""loved""in the end.i love her scenes with her ""father"" tim daly,he is such a good actor in this.so good looking.i love the way he did adore her lovely Mother""easter"" but just not enough to Marry her back then etc.as marrying a woman whose white who clearly he might have love somewhat,but NOT at all as MUCH as the lovely black woman/slave Easter who born his child.i love each part but mainly with that handsome sexy good looking ACTOR TIM DALY i love him in ""each scene""with pretty and the talented ""whitley""from a different world actress Jasmine GUY! love it all,
.
and also ann magaret a VERY great actress in this and few other movies i see her in danny glover is good too as my fave bella halle so beautifully talented she is really an amazing woman actress love her to death. i can envision each time watching ROOTS  this as being Alex Haley grandmother on his father side,that is how GREAT! her acting is etc just enjoying the whole cast did superb like Martin Sheen in this classic too! the best movies are back in the day on our heritage slavery etc. true life stories are best drama etc. in my opinion. Lonette Mckee lovely self was also in this as alice.

I enjoy her films too t.v.shows etcd.

To respond to some concerns about the DVD, they did not leave any parts of the movie out. When the first episode ends, be sure to go to the main menu and choose Episode two. That will show the parts of the film that people say are missing.

Also, coming from someone who has read the book more than once, no character in the film is random. They are all there for a purpose and their story is relevant to Queen's life in the book.",1214265600,102,637,3.96875

(Ann-Margret too, by the way).
If you hate overdramatic stories, especially when you are not sure what the story is aiming at, avoid it. It took me forever to watch it because it made me feel like a bad Danielle Steel movie. There is something cheap about the way the story was used to make this saga come to life (!) on screen.

I must say that I have not finished reading the original novel (it is quite long and difficult to complete given the fact the first few chapters date back to Ireland).  But this movie version is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Halle Berry as Queen, in her first role as a truly credible and outstanding lead actress, was FLAWLESS.  Every line, EVERY SINGLE LINE of dialogue was delivered effortlessly and with almost deadly precision.  I first watched Queen when it debuted as a mini-series but I was quite young and did not fully grasp the concepts.  But as an adult, this story totally enveloped me.  And as Queen's life unfolded, I felt as though a part of me opened as well.

All the actors did an outstanding job, particularly Ann-Margaret, Tim Daly, and the ever-radiant Jasmine Guy as Queen's slave-born mother.  It is a long movie and can become emotionally taxing, but if you can spare it, all 283 minutes are worth the time.",1202428800,58,961,4.740963855421687
