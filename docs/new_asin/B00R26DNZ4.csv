8693815,4,B00R26DNZ4,"This is a 1953 CinemaScope classic, the third CinemaScope movie ever made.  As such, the sweeping Florida sunsets and sunrises don't disappoint.  This film is a great time capsule of a Florida of more than 50 years gone; some things have changed, and some have not.

It's great to see a young Robert Wagner, so youthful and springy.  And there's Peter Graves, reprising his dashing bad guy a la Stalag 17.

The story is Romeo and Juliet on the Gulf Coast, and it's pretty easy to follow.  Character development is shallow, and there are massive jumps in the story, such as the boy and the girl sailing off into they Keys for some undetermined amount of time, and upon returning declaring that they are man and wife.  Huh?  Never mind, as it all works out in the end with love and romance, and a tragic death, of course.",1512345600,,819,4.486486486486487
8693816,1,B00R26DNZ4,"I thought that I had purchased the ""great transfer"" DVD. This is an awful DVD. It looks like it is patched with Scotch tape. There is also a trademark of the DVD company in the lower right corner of the frame that shows for several minutes. How could Amazon offer such poor quality product?",1506556800,,290,4.388888888888889

8693818,2,B00R26DNZ4,"Aside from ""Raiders from Beneath the Sea"" (which is entertaining enough), I really enjoy these films.  But I have had to return five copies of the DVD set because the discs for ""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"" and ""Raiders from Beneath the Sea: are reversed.  The disc labeled ""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"" actually contains ""Raiders from Beneath the Sea"", and the disc labeled ""Raiders from Beneath the Sea"" actually contains ""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"".  When you receive your copy of the set, make sure that you check the discs promptly.",1487635200,,530,4.932584269662922
8693819,5,B00R26DNZ4,What a great way to see Tarpon Springs the way it used to be!,1481155200,,61,3.4285714285714284
8693820,5,B00R26DNZ4,"One family Greek the other WASP compete in the sponge industry off the western cost of Florida in the 50's. They have an unwritten law as to here they can fish for sponges. The heads of each house are proud and there is more than a casual rivalry among them.

Due to hard times the families cross paths resulting tin the son of the Greek family Tony Petrakis (Robert Wagner) and the WASP daughter Gwyneth Rhys (Terry Moore) falling in love their parents' chagrin. To really stir thing up Arnold Dix (Peter Graves) who also has eyes for Gwyneth is unscrupulous and does nefarious acts agent the Greeks.

I know you have herd the story before and probably saw Romeo and Juliet or ""Westside Story"". However, the story and actors make it worth revisiting.

The film has been remastered and looks great on large screen height definition televisions. The music of Bernard Hermann works as a subtle character its self adds to the mood and not overwhelming the story or dialog.

Gilbert Roland is the proud Greek patriarch that makes a sort of John Wayne entrance at the beginning of the movie. Richard Boone, a very diverse actor plays the girls father.

This is the first underwater adventure shot in CinemaScope.",1457740800,,1207,4.701421800947867
8693821,5,B00R26DNZ4,The restoration is incredible. This is a 60+ year old film that has been brought back to life. I have been watching it on occasion for nearly 50 years. This is a must-have for any fans of the movie.,1455580800,,198,4.102564102564102
