8765185,1,B01HDW7D34,"I was looking for a decent, not anywhere nearly perfect, copy of Balloon Land but the version presented here is horrible and unacceptable. I can accept some pops, or the occasional missing frame, but the sound is not in sync with the image and there are far too many missing frames and dropped sound sequences. The version online on YouTube is far superior and there it is presented in the proper screen ratio, unlike this version from Alpha Video. At least the collection was cheap, but I cannot recommend this item at all.",1470528000,4,524,4.645161290322581
