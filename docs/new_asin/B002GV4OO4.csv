8370069,5,B002GV4OO4,"Before I say anything, I have to note that this set is for Region 2 (ie: won't play on the vast majority of North American Region 1 players).  I have an all-region player so I was able to watch the DVD set.  Also, you can find a way (google) to convert any player to all-region by following simple instructions.  Most players can be reprogrammed for region a few times before they run out of programming memory.

To the DVD set itself:  James May is a very talented presenter, and here he features several toys of my childhood.  In each case he sets out to construct the super-size version of the toy.  For Lego, he builds a full size two-storey house and spends the night in it, all made of Lego blocks!

For Meccano (that's Erector on this side of the ocean) he constructs a bridge from thousands of standard parts that goes across a portion of the Mersey River in Liverpool (where Meccano originated in 1901 and was made until 1979) and he walks across it.

For Airfix (plastic kits) he has constructed a 1:1 model of the Airfix Spitfire, which is wheeled out and parked next to the real thing.  Quite amazing.

For Scalextric (slot cars) he builds a miles-long slot car track and runs a 2-car race.

For Hornby (electric trains) he also builds a multi-mile track and goes successfully for the Guiness book of records.

Altogether, a very entertaining set of programs, highly recommended.",1346716800,3,1391,4.582995951417004
8370070,4,B002GV4OO4,"If you want to be entertained and informed at the same time and especially if you have young children who in need of a REAL education, sit down with them and watch an episode a week and then discuss the contents with them, maybe even try a brief foray into these 'toys' as a family and watch their minds expand. I think you might well be surprised at what joy and stimulation, apparently dated (according to whom?) toys still be.

Although it is hard to choose favourites, for me, the best episodes were the ones that showed a real sense of the English community spirit, episodes such as 'Scalextric' or 'Plastersine' were an absolute joy.

The only minor disappointment was the final episode 'Lego', which I couldn't help feeling suffered from severe production issues. Firstly there was the very bizarre choice of location for the house and then there was the 'what happened to it?' in the end. Considering the great efforts of the English public who helped so much in actually making the 'bricks' that went into constructing the house. I felt this was ultimately a let-down and something which was essentially incomplete. In retrospect, a better idea would to have built it in the National Gallery or somewhere such and to then have donated it to their permanent collection.

Of the James May DVDs I own I would rank them as follows:

i) James May's c. 20th
i) Oz and James 2 (USA)

ii) James May's Toy Stories
ii) Oz and James 1 (France)

iii) Oz and James Drink to Britain

iv) James May on the Moon",1281398400,5,1504,4.568773234200743
