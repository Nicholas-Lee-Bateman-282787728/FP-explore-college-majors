8007982,4,B00018WN7E,It was funny in some spots but not what I expected. I liked Fly Away Home better.,1284163200,,81,3.823529411764706
8007983,5,B00018WN7E,"Looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy? Look no further than Hildegarde, a funny and touching story about 3 children searching for their duck-napped pet duck, Hildegarde. Kids will enjoy the ""chase"" as the kids' antics to get their duck back get wilder and wilder. Adults will love Richard E. Grant as the ""bad guy"", especially those of us who remember him from ""Withnail and I"". Funny, touching, sometimes sad, and very ""uplifting"" at the end (I don't want to give away too much of the GREAT ending!) Hildegarde is a little Australian gem, just perfect for family movie night - all you need to add is popcorn!",1095811200,4,618,4.627272727272727
8007984,5,B00018WN7E,"For those parents of younger kids or who want to limit the amount of violence their kids watch this one is great. It has all the drama, adventure and tension without all the violence. We all cried (and laughed). Great for toddlers to pre-teens.",1095292800,3,244,4.568181818181818
