3724995,5,B001NZA0GA,"If Lucrezia Borgia isn't one of Donizetti's masterpieces, I don't know which is. Even if it were the only opera that he composed, it would suffice to crown him a genius. What more is the plenitude of reasons that justifies it not just as a masterpiece, but also as a seminal work that reflects the learned past and the incipient future of Italian opera. Containing the ingredients for any successful 'Grand' opera of both drama and buffa elements, it is an opera that moves away from the typical languor of unyielding romantic love to a territory that elucidates all the other facets of the human condition - marital jealousy, class and power struggle, youthful heroism, brotherhood and friendship and last but most importantly, deceit and duplicity and the seemingly irreconciliable differences of maternal love and femme fatale so wonderfully brought to life, flesh and blood with the glorious music and libretto, never a moment steeped in self-pity but ever an affirmation of life and beauty - a trait that is ever-present in Donizetti's music.

Donizetti was acquainted young (when he took to composition after his unsuccessful stint as a singing student) with the music of the Viennese masters - Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. Careful listening would reveal a substantial influence of Mozart in Borgia. Take the meticulous orchestration for example. The strings pizzicati in Act 1 of the duet between Lucrezia and the Duke is well-nigh reminiscent of a similar use in Mozart's Magic Flute (in the long introduction before the duet of the two armored men). The death toll that haunts Orsini and Gennaro seems almost like a mirror or direct quotation of the Commendatore's deathly warning before the fateful supper scene. Mozart's genius resonates through and through Borgia even though the style of expression is unmistakably Donizetti's. There are many other examples that defy quick references, but one would be Gennaro's heavenly pleas closely resembling tenor role Don Ottavio's in Mozart's Don Giovanni.

Lucrezia is probably Donizetti's most lyrical (containing some of his most glorious, effortless hallmark bel canto tunes) and tightly composed opera (yes, even more so than Lucia), with its succession of themes carefully juxtaposed and linked through musical motifs (e.g. Lucrezia's 'motherly' motif announced by the strings), keys and harmonic shifts. The immense musicality of the opera is such that, each melodious tune seems to have written itself for the narrative and flows to the next like a seamless stream of consciousness. There is never a note or a chord out of place and the opera never seems a moment too long, unlike say, Donizetti's earlier work Anna Bolena. The almost Oedipal plot lends itself to some interesting irony and offers much impetus for creative buoyancy in the libretto as well as the music. While the eponymous title role gives limelight to the coloratura soprano, it allows plenty of room for expression in the leading male roles of the lyric tenor as well as the baritone, requiring a depth of skill in both singing as well as acting.

Once again Gruberova wins over the role (and her audience) as she did with those before her. Her dramatic elocution of the words and wonderfully controlled dynamics secures the depth of the titular character; depth and multi-dimension is essential for any villain-hero/heroine character. Trademark Gruberova includes phenomenal ability to hold long lines (e.g. Finale of the Prologue where Lucrezia's identity was exposed) and to scale octaves in climatic codas to heighten the drama (where other sopranos conveniently choose to err on the safe side) and the amazing ability (I cannot stress this more) to hover on high notes for what seems like an eternity that many sopranos could only dream off.

Some may detract to say that Gruberova's lower register was never her forte. This is equivalent to saying a professional singer or pianist or any musician for the matter would never improve on his or her trade with time. This is wholly untrue for Gruberova. Performing pianist Louis Lortie once said that a pianist's virtuosity may decline with time but the playing only grows richer and more expressive. This is so true (perhaps even more true) for the singing voice. Gruberova's lower register is more full and rounded in Borgia, as compared to a decade earlier when she sang live, Elisabetta in Roberto Devereux. How this 'new' quality of her voice translates to enrich the role of Lucrezia could be evidently felt in her heart-wrenching aria ""Com'e Bello"", which in my opinion, is Donizetti's most sublimely written for soprano. It is a role that inevitably and perfectly lands itself in her repertoire as a maturing singer (and one who matures gracefully). Gruberova captures all the dilemma and anguish integral to the role and very often (not without some irony and humour) qualities that are testimony to her versatility and experience that accrue over her rich singing career.

Special accolade goes to dashing tenor Pavol Breslik as Lucrezia's illegitimate son Gennaro. He certainly fits the role like no other - the youthful quality of his voice, very fine, passionate and uncompromising singing and his exhilarating stage presence that contains a balanced amount of youthful capriciousness and heroism accompanied by a darker melancholic vein. The problem with most productions lies with miscast tenors that sound and look too old for the role, causing the productions to look ludicrous and consequently doing the music much injustice.

Special mention goes to Alice Coote as a very admirable Orsini. A commanding stage presence in terms of singing and acting and her very 'butch' makeover simply add another dimension to the role. Conductor Bertrand de Billy takes the music at much-needed bouyant tempi that brings urgency and dramatic impetus to the plot. While I wouldn't say the audience cares only for the singers, I would think a live performance does bring out the best in the music as compared to a studio recording. Opera is always meant to be lived and played from the stage. Some cuts are in place (e.g. Gennaro's aria at the beginning of Act 1, omission of the Duke's entrance before Lucrezia's climatic final aria and cabaletta) but they generally serve the dramatic coherence of the music rather than to detract from it.

The accompanying documentary on Gruberova adds value to the purchase and has certainly added to my understanding and appreciation of Gruberova and her art.

A most timely and much needed update of a seminal bel canto opera containing some of the most glorious music ever written.",1290211200,8,6608,5.1063829787234045
3724996,2,B001NZA0GA,I'm afraid I must agree with the first reviewer about this production. Dimitra is a great diappointment. She has a strange hesitant approach to her scale singing; soft then strident and fadeing in and out. I found it most disturbing. Also disturbing was watching her as she juts out her jaw. In her long scene with husband Don Alfonso I found myself enjoying his singing and recoiled when she would start. I found Iori the be the best singer of the cast. I thought the sets and the production adequate and appropriate. The other singers were fine for this second circuit Italian house. I enjoyed the dances and the banqueting; though I would like to have seen the coffins in the final scene. It would have been a delicious touch. I'll file this DVD away and it will gather dust; my DVD with Sutherland and Kraus does not get dusty. Now there is a real singer!,1282521600,3,859,4.512820512820513
3724997,5,B001NZA0GA,"I don't usually review items I've purchased, but like another viewer, I could not help feeling compelled to do so following the appalling reviews that have been left of this item, because I feel that after finally buying this DVD after being put off by the bad reviews, I find that not one single criticism I have read is justified.

Yes, this is a modern minimalist production, and if you're hoping to see lavish sets and costumes, you will very much be disappointed. The stage is bare with minimal props, and as usual in these kinds of productions, it is the actions and interactions of the characters that portray the drama. With the subtitles on, I had no trouble following the (inevitable) drama unfold. Clearly the previous reviewers have a more ""traditional"" kind of production in mind, but anyone who is a regular opera goer should know by now that those kinds of productions are becoming rarer and rarer. Everything in Christof Loy's production is relevant and significant, and Brian Large's camera work makes the production even more interesting than it would have been on stage.

But the most worrying criticism is about Gruberova's voice. The whole work is much more dramatic than one is used to hearing from her, with very little of the coloratura singing that we have come to expect from one of her performances. It is only at the end that we get some Gruberovaisms, and the claims that her voice is coming apart here are completely untrue. She is an amazing actress, and all the gravel and noise in her voice are part of her portrayal of a wretched woman who at this point has just killed her son (again).

The biggest disappointment, in reality, is the accompanying documentary, which as other reviewers have commented is merely a fan tribute. Conductors, singers, friends etc are interviewed (or invited to make a heartfelt comment), but noone is ever named. Of course many viewers would recognise many of these, but one who I think is supposed to be an oboist at some opera house, is unlikely to be known. It would be nice to see a proper documentary of an amazing career at some point, but we may have to wait until after retirement.

So all in all, a highly recommended performance, but remember: this is a modern, minimalist staging.",1263168000,12,2254,4.727735368956743
3724998,3,B001NZA0GA,"Alright, I can't pass by this DVD once again without leaving something to counter the dismal rating of the first reviewer ~ While I've only given it here three stars, basically for the ""Lucrezia"" program, I'd give four stars to the second disc ""The Art of Belcanto"", a lovely intimate look at Edita's dedication to her art, which has been her life as well.  Very touching and moving ... to see her in preparation for this role, rehearsing in excellent voice, is a treat.  To view her childhood hometown, church and the pear tree where it all began, priceless.  You soon learn she is not the diva, just basically a woman doing her job; abet with a dedication and a sense of duty, fulfilling her purpose in this world. No nonsense, no fuss, just a reverence for her art and the gift she was bestowed.  I met Ms. Gruberova many, many years ago as a young man in the side streets of the Vienna Opera house - she never was a personality, she was a person, delightful, charming and this disc shows little has changed.  Brava, Edita on a life well lived and a purpose well served.  As to the ""Lucrezia"" performance, it is in fact a senseless production of what really is a motionless opera.  Nothing really takes place of substance to stage, so some showy Venice opulence would have been welcomed, here all we get is a bare stage flanked by ""Lucrezia Borgia"" in type font illuminated in lighting across the back wall, a few chairs thrown in here and there and a lot of adult men dressed as schoolboys and acting nearly as infantile.  Whatever the intended concept, I doubt that it played any better on stage than it does in video ~ do not buy this DVD for the production, buy it rather for the beautiful music which abounds in this Donizetti piece and for the rather good on the whole collective singing; most notably from Alice Coote and Edita Gruberova.  The voice is not what it was forty or for that matter twenty years ago, BUT, compare this woman's 60 year old voice with the so called coloratura sopranos of today, not in comparison with her past,  and I tell you that 8 or 9 out of 10 Edita can still hold her own and rest miles ahead of any contenders ~ it is a miracle of nature that she still possess an instrument capable of the high demands of Belcanto singing.  I remain in awe.  Few if any names of today come to mind which can yet hold a candle to her abilities, even at an advanced age.  The score is given the attention to detail that is deserves and Edita sings it as it should be sung, trills, high notes and sospiri in the voice as required.  Sadly, it is only her final note in the opera after a long night on stage that goes awry, turning sour and unsecured ~ a shame for she'd been hitting it all night long.  Her performance merits the purchase and perhaps you'll find as I, the second documentary disc is even more rewarding than the title disc.  Brava, Edita!! Bis!",1259452800,21,2885,4.3745318352059925

3725000,4,B001NZA0GA,"I watched this opera with trepidation given the previous review, but was pleasantly surprised. Grove notes that in Lucrezia Borgia we have a dramatic almost Verdian creation and here we have a very gripping telling of the tale.  Lucrezia is not sung as flawlessly as she was by Sutherland, but here she is well acted and is always believable whether in the business of poisoning others or grieving over her son. All the cast act well and were well directed and their singing is more than adequate. The sound is good, picture quality very fine, sets and costumes appropriate to the time, and the orchestra well conducted.  I judged the time watching as well spent.",1249776000,8,663,4.756521739130434
3725001,2,B001NZA0GA,"This performance just isn't up to scratch, and the problems start with the prima donna.  Perhaps an appreciation of Dimitra Theodossiou's voice is an acquired taste.  If so, I haven't acquired it.  I found very little bel in her canto.  Rather, I thought the voice large, strident, acidic and plagued with a vibrato that threatened to get out of control at any moment.  Unfortunately, the scenes in which she appears are a real trial for the ears, and the rest of the cast aren't a great deal better.

Enrico Giuseppe Iori and Nidia Palacios are acceptable, but no more, as Don Alfonso and Maffio Orsini.  Mr. Iori has an imposing presence, and voice to match, and can bluster with the best of them.  Ms. Palacio possesses a small, but adequate voice.  I can't imagine why the costume designer put her in a platinum-blonde fright wig, though.

The performing edition conforms to that published by Ricordi, meaning that Lucrezia loses her cabaletta in the Prologue (whew!).  It also means that Gennaro doesn't get the second act aria that Richard Bonynge included on his recording featuring Giacomo Aragall as Gennaro.  This is rather a pity as Roberto De Biasio (Gennaro in this performance) was the only cast member I'd not mind hearing again.  Indeed, his voice rather reminded me of that of Mr. Aragall  -- a warm, ingratiating tone, used with taste, intelligence and sensitivity.  He shades his voice well and produces some very lovely soft singing.

The production itself is unremarkable.  The set consists of walls, windows and doors that move about to produce different spaces for each scene.  The costumes are best described as ""inspired"" by the Italian Renaissance.  The bevy of dancing Amazons who accompany Alfonso are rather silly, but inoffensive.  The picture quality is poor.  Bright colours, such as the crimson gowns at the beginning of the final scene, over-saturate and rapid movements leave a trail of blurs behind them.

The set comes with a booklet illustrated with black and white photos and containing a complete cast list, with brief biographies, a background essay and a track-by-track synopsis.

On the whole, you can give this one a miss.  If you really want a DVD of this opera, you're better off with the performance from Covent Garden with Joan Sutherland and Alfredo Krause.  I enjoy this opera best on the old RCA recording with Montserrat Caballe, Alfredo Krause and Shirley Verrett.",1237075200,15,2417,4.95273631840796

8328511,5,B001NZA0GA,"Check out ""the Golden Age Lucrezia Borgia, vol I"" where the soprano can be heard singing the tenor line in the interlude of her aria Com'e bello. I don't really think Donizetti wrote for coloraturas  -- he invented the Verdian soprano, in my opinion. And I heartily applaud the wonderful erudition and good sense of the person who objected to the ""not a masterpiece"" canard.",1392681600,,374,4.753846153846154
8328512,5,B001NZA0GA,"The first time I viewed this BD I was completely unacquainted with the opera and had a hard time trying to gather, from Loys unorthodox staging, what it was all about. But after watching the conventional, straightforward, and somewhat flatfooted 2011 San Francisco performance staged by John Pascoe with Rene Fleming in the title role, I saw this Munich performance again and was absolutely delighted by the singing and the acting, not just of Gruberova, but of Vassallo, Breslik and Coote, and fascinated by the boldness and the appropriateness of Loys concept.",1386633600,,562,5.119565217391305
8328513,4,B001NZA0GA,"Based on the mixed reviews, I hesitated to buy this but fate took the matter out of my hands and I found it wrapped as a Christmas gift. As to the opera itself, Charles Osborne (The Bel Canto Operas) refers to it as Donizetti's best pre-Anna Bolena opera and I agree. It is filled with lovely melodies and dramatic potential; in sum, all that we love in bel canto works. CD recordings with Caballe and Kraus, and Sutherland, Horne and Aragall provide mighty fine listening, but DVDs of complete performances are limited to three.

The different reviewer opinions, gentle reader, seems to focus on Mme Theodossiu's performance. For as long as I have enjoyed opera (and that is a VERY long time, indeed), there have been VERY intense differences of opinion as to this soprano vs. that soprano, with the ladies, it is said, fueling the fires by publicly doing the ""fit hissy"" thing, while privately agreeing that revenue was enhanced thereby. Having said that, let me be clear that I ""have no dog in this hunt"". There are times when I like Mme Theodossiou's work and times when I do not. If I was to cast this opera, I would look for a different voice, but not having that option, I am satisfied, but not thrilled by her work: there is a roughness that creeps into the voice on occasion that I have noted in other reviews, which are distracting.

But since I really like Lucrezia and enjoy watching it, the distraction is bearable. That said, the other performers do contribute much to my enjoyment of the performance. Bi Biasio is a tenor I like a lot. He has performed on several DVDs including a dandy Maria Stuarda and an intense I Due Foscari. Nida Palacios is no Marilyn Horne (and who is?) but she carries off the part of Maffio Orsini quite well. The rest of the cast does a fine job, as well.

One nitpick: too much of the opera is dark, which is a comment on stageing, but otherwise, the performance is quite traditional.

Disc quality is excellent as to both picture and sound (love the DTS surround!!) The venue is the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo, Donizetti's home town, which means that this is regional Italian opera, lacking in many of the ""whistles and bells"" that the big houses bring to an opera. But like Verdi in Parma, and Rossini in Pesaro, there is no doubt about the passion of the audiences.

The Berganigi liked this a lot and I did too. But if Mme Theodossiou ain't your cuppa, pass on.",1364515200,2,2410,4.531034482758621
8328514,4,B001NZA0GA,"Directed by Christof Loy, this 2009 Munich production of Lucrezia Borgia doesn't look like any bel canto opera production you've seen before, but it does look a lot like a typical Christof Loy production - bare minimally decorated stage, everyone wearing dinner jackets, a couple of chairs scattered around.  That's 15th century Venice of the Prologue.  The only real distinguishing feature is the distinguished figure of Edita Gruberova as Lucrezia Borgia, wearing a period costume in bold red while everyone else is dressed in black and white and the stage is grey, and the words LUCREZIA BORGIA spelt out in big block letters along the back wall.  That's something at least, meaning that it will allow one letter to be dropped at a significant point in the First Act, even if that's about as much as a concession as you'll find here to the stage directions in the libretto.  Oh, and Orsini and his men look like public schoolboys, with floppy hair and their trousers rolled-up to just below the knees.  What on earth is that all about?

Despite confusion over just what exactly Christof Loy's intentions could possibly be, and the nagging feeling that he really is displaying nothing but contempt for the work, your ears should tell a different story and you might even begrudgingly admit that somehow - without really being able to put your finger on the reason why - the production actually does work.  Lucrezia Borgia is not an easy opera to make work on the stage.  The plot line, derived from a work by Victor Hugo and awkwardly adapted for Donizetti by Francesco Maria Piave, is rather ridiculous, weighed down by exposition and unlikely coincidences.  If we're to accept the conflict within Lucrezia over her maternal feelings for Gennaro and her monstrous activities as part of the murderous Borgia family, you have to find some humanity in there, and that's not easily found within the libretto.  Although Donizetti's scoring can seem a little bit bel canto by numbers, and even with Bertrand de Billy conducting it does tend to plod along in places, there are nonetheless some marvellous opportunities for a singer to bring out that underlying humanity of Lucrezia Borgia, but really you need a singer like Joan Sutherland to be capable of expressing it.  Or Edita Gruberova.

Commanding terrific presence from the moment she appears in her red period dress while all around her speak of youth and modernism, Gruberova - with respect - looks like a relic from the past.  And this is perhaps where Christof Loy's production - created specifically for the Bayerische Staatsoper following Loy and Gruberova's previous collaboration on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roberto-Devereux/dp/B000F39MAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roberto Devereux</a>&nbsp;- comes into its own.  Lucrezia Borgia is indeed a relic of the past, the latest in a long line of a dynasty of terror whose crimes have not been forgotten by Orsini and his men, who are at long last speaking out against the tyranny of the Borgias.  The challenges of playing the role of Lucrezia Borgia then are not so much in the singing - which, to say the least, is challenge enough - but in making Lucrezia work as a real character.  No amount of props and costumes and period detail is going to make Lucrezia Borgia any more convincing as a drama, but creating an environment that gives the necessary space to the actual real strengths of the work - the arias and the coloratura given expression by singers of sufficient stature and quality - and actually highlighting them against the rather drab background, seems to me to be working with the nature, qualities and weaknesses of the opera itself.  Making you like the character or sympathise with her is not the issue, making her come to life is the real challenge, and Edita Gruberova can do that.  Not many others can.

The decision then, following their previous collaboration on the stunning Munich production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roberto-Devereux/dp/B000F39MAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roberto Devereux</a>, to build this new production of Lucrezia Borgia around Gruberova, proves to be a great success, and is perhaps the only way it would work.  It might as well say EDITA GRUBEROVA on the backdrop.  She is simply mesmerising to watch and to listen to, rising to the challenges that the nature of her character represents and meeting the demanding nature of the arias.  In fact, she shows that they are one and the same, that the complex nature of the character can only be expressed though the phrasing and the delivery, with full command and awareness of how one's own tone of voice can be used towards meeting that objective.  Experience, if you like, but it's more than that.  For Lucrezia Borgia to succeed it needs more than just a good technique and experience, it needs a voice of real substance and personality, and Edita Gruberova certainly has that.  It helps considerably though if you have a strong Gennaro and Pavol Breslik is one of the finest tenors around.  I don't think there is sufficient attention paid to making his character ""work"" within the dramatic context of the opera and to a large extent the other roles - Alice Coote's Orsini and Franco Vassallo's Don Alfonso - are similarly sung well but weakly characterised (there are limits to what a stage director or performer can do with this libretto), but the opera - as is made clear - is all about LUCREZIA BORGIA, and this is one production that is worthy of being capitalised.

There is a slight downside to the production choices however in that it doesn't always come across as effectively as it might on the screen, or indeed in the audio mixing.  The use of metal plates for a raised platform causes a fair amount of clatter and rattling, while the boxed empty stage leads to an echoing tone that affects the acoustics of the singing and, it seems, the orchestration.  The quality of the singing is evident - and Edita Gruberova doesn't have too much trouble being heard - but the tone is metallic and far from the warm sound you would expect for a bel canto opera.  Within the limitations of the mostly bare stage, Brian Large directs as well as he can for the small screen, taking in the impact of the whole stage with edits that are attuned to the rhythms of the music, but it still never really manages to bring the staging to life.  The image quality is strong in the High Definition presentation, the audio tracks - PCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.0 - are however rather limited in dynamic range by the acoustics.  The Blu-ray also includes a fascinating hour-long documentary 'The Art of Bel Canto - Edita Gruberova', charting the career of the Czech-Slovak soprano and her approach to opera.  The BD is region-free and subtitles for the main feature are English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.",1349136000,3,6923,5.0026132404181185
8328515,3,B001NZA0GA,"I have love/hate feelings for this blu-ray--on the one hand I hate the very idea of Eurotrash, but on the other hand this performance is so outstanding I would not want to be without it. So I am like Gennaro, who hates Lucrezia but loves her also.
The tenor singing Gennaro has a magnetic stage presence, which is only reduced by the removal of his shirt. Though he is the hero who saved his friend on the battlefield, he behaves like a little boy or a simpleton, hopping about on one foot while singing impeccable bel canto. Mamma mia! Amazing what a boy will do in the presence of ""la Borgia!""
Edita Gruberova may be well past her vocal prime, and it shows for the first two minutes, but after she warms up the coloratura is unimpeachable. The other young principals have perfect voices for their roles and sing their hearts out. As for the horseplay on stage, it left me aghast, but so long as they kept singing I was able to maintain a sense of denial about what was before my very eyes. Donizetti managed to upstage the Director! Yes, he did! The Director did his worst, but he couldn't take Donizetti down!
--
PS This production clocks in at 133 minutes. By contrast, the 1980 Covent Garden performance featuring Joan Sutherland and Alfredo Kraus comes in at 157 minutes. So, 24 minutes of Donizetti's music are missing in this version. Sometimes less is more, but here less is really less--less wonderful music, and less juvenile stomping too. So that would be one star off for the cuts, and one star off for the stomping.",1344470400,3,1529,4.5234657039711195
8328516,4,B001NZA0GA,"Dimitra Theodossiou is given very positive reviews by most Amazon reviewers of other operas, and two reviewers writing here are out of step in their extreme negatives. Her singing can be powerful and her emotional expression unusual, but don't get turned off without hearing her. (Some people don't like the other Greek, Callas.)
This staging is not modern (just to clear that up for people who don't like other unusual ideas}. The production is very good, if a little old, and the music is a pleasure. I like seeing and hearing this authentic Italian experience in an excellent small company.
Other reviewers are close enough on most detail of the DVD, but in overdoing dislike of Theodossiou they distort the Amazon rating, and more people could enjoy something different.",1338163200,4,774,5.007751937984496
8328517,3,B001NZA0GA,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  Some more details:

Gennaro, Lucrezia's hidden son, is very young, young enough to hop about while talking to Lucrezia, the beautiful lady he admires... in other words he is a restless innocent 14-year old.  But the role is played by Pavol Breslik, a fully grown man probably in his late thirties or early forties, as can be seen when he takes off his white shirt to wipe the blood from his scraped knee (being motherless, Gennaro cannot be expected to have a clean handkerchief in his pocket).  Result: he looks like an idiot!

Lucrezia has red hair, most of the time.  Toward the end of the opera, she suddenly appears in a long-haired white wig; she removes it during the scene (her red hair remains in place), then puts it back, for no apparent reason.  I assume there is a deep psychological or philosophical meaning to it... But no footnotes to explain.

At Princess Negroni's party, we see a girl sitting on a chair, staring in front of her.  She doesn't move; she doesn't sing.  She just sits.

The staging is DO IT YOURSELF! If a character is supposed to sit at a table, the singer appears carrying his own table, with a lesser character carrying the chair!

WARNING:  The booklet informs you that the same director, Christof Loy, is responsible for the staging of Roberto Devereux, also with Edita Gruberova.  That is another one I shall avoid, sight unseen!  I would also avoid her Norma:  there is no way a 65-year old woman can pretend to be the mother of ""due pargoletti"", two children under 10.  CDs are one thing, but DVDs and Blu-Ray discs should strive to look believable!  ""Suspension of disbelief"" applies to the plot, not to pretending that grandmothers have babies!",1329436800,5,1724,4.67109634551495
8328518,3,B001NZA0GA,"Based on a Victor Hugo play, Donizetti fashioned an opera about Lucrecia Borgia, an alleged real life 15th century serial killer and sex maniac.  If you have never seen or heard the opera, I think you will be surprised how many great melodies Donizetti wrote for this very melodramatic opera.  The entire cast sing and act with gusto.

The problem is the Eurotrash production design.....no sets, bare stage, conference room chairs, a hideous greyish beige wall, modern dress, and vaudville type spotlights:)  I kid you not !  Maybe some of you don't mind this look, but it really bothered me.  I watched it once and when I play it again it will be enjoyed sans video.  The music is fabulous.",1329177600,6,691,4.708333333333333
8328519,2,B001NZA0GA,"The minimalist staging and silly clothes are a turn off for such a historical opera.  With some operas it can work well, but not this one.  The stage direction wasn't much better.....really distracting.

Gruberova is sadly well past prime, but could be fine in less demanding roles with a lot less high notes.  She tries for chest voice in the low notes but just gets hoarsness.  But the audience applause shows what a great following she has.  The lady is gutsy to take on this role and I do admire her for that.

Franco Vassallo was quite good, but a bit lyric for such a nasty guy.  Made me want to hear him in lighter roles.
