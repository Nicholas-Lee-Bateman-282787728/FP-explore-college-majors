646022,2,6303442358,"As huge of a Three Stooges fan that I've been since like the age of ten, here recently was my very first time I happen to sit all the way through this 1959 (truly) waste-of-time film. Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe do manage to scrap together a few (and, I talking very few) laughable scenes. But for the most part, Curly-Joe (Joe De Rita) is a complete dork. At least, Joe Besser had his moments - sort of maybe wish he had filled the role of Curly-Joe in the six Stooges feature films.",1306713600,,481,4.239130434782608
646023,5,6303442358,"""Have Rocket"" (1959) was the closest the Stooges' feature-length film with DeRita came to the speed and intensity of their late 30s/early 40s shorts. Yet, while all their other ""Curly Joe""-era features are on DVD this remains absent. There a reason for this? It can't be ""lack of interest""- especially since lesser known films (""Gold Raiders"", ""Meet the Baron"", ""Soup To Nuts"") and lesser accepted films (fake Shemp and Joe Besser are) are now immortalized on DVD. Is it a legal reason? Litagation between Jean DeRita and the Howard family, perhaps?
I may be wrong. For all I know there are plans for a DVD. If anyone knows yes-or-no, and any reasons why, please post in the coments section. Thanx...",1293753600,2,700,4.841666666666667

646025,5,6303442358,"I do not own this movie, But i have seen it a thousand times. It's my favorite out of their features besides Snow White and the 3 Stooges. I would love to see it be brought out on DVD like all of the other great three stooges classics. I think that it's fantastic that they sing in the film that's a classic. Although i would have loved to have seen Curly Howard in the film. Don't get me wrong, i liked Curly-Joe DeRita, but he wasn't at all funny as Curly Howard. I would recommend this movie to any three stooges fan. Especially if you're just now being introduced to them this would be a great film to get you started!",1243382400,,622,4.148760330578512
646026,4,6303442358,"With newcomer Curly look-a-like Joe DeRita joining the team, the Three Stooges finally (after 24 years of shorts!) made the jump to feature films with ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"".
An often bizarre adventure (The Stooges encounter such things as a friendly alien unicorn, an unfriendly giant fire-breathing tarantula, and a trio of robots resembling you-know-who), their feature debut confirmed that the Stooges were back, and bigger & more popular than ever.
Lightweight in plot--and budget--the Stooges succeed on clever scripts such as this one, which places most of the more violent slapstick moments on others, yet gives them plenty of room to clown. Besides this is the fact that, after years of hard labor & exposure, the Stooges were immediately identifiable personalities, and could carry a picture on this strength alone.
Just one question: WHEN are Columbia/Sony Pictures going to wake up and give this movie the DVD treatment as well??",1213488000,,945,5.264900662251655
646027,5,6303442358,"In 1957,the late Moe Howard and the late Larry Fine finished their 24-year business at Columbia Pictures,filming 190 two-reel shorts with Moe's brothers Curly and Shemp and Joe Besser,respectively. Besser quit The Three Stooges to take care of his ill wife and the Stooges continued their careers with feature films. So Joseph Wardell,aka Curly Joe DeRita became the third Stooge. In fact,Wardell was originally chosen for the third Stooge after Shemp died in 1955. But Wardell was working with another act at the time and was contractually forbidden to quit. But when that contract expired around the time of Besser's exit,Wardell again got the chance to join the team and did so. So,we see the boys visiting outer space,complete with gags,of course. There's a party at the end,and of course,pie-throwing. What a hilarious film! A must for all Stooge fans.",1205366400,,857,5.128571428571429
646028,2,6303442358,"The Three Stooges work as maintenance men at a rocket research facility.  The film begins with stock footage showing a rocket taking off, but wavering shortly after blast off, and going off course, though the event of crashing is not shown.  Then, we are shown the rocket ship sticking nose down in the ground (it is a life-sized model, not an actual rocket ship).  The Three Stooges are asked to stand guard at the crash site, but they somehow enter the ship, and it tips upright, and by accident the Stooges start the ignition, and the ship zooms off to another planet, where it lands.

There is a decent zero-gravity episode, where Larry is shown floating about, attempting to retrieve a floating book.

There is little attempt to make the ""other planet"" seem other-worldly.  It is just a desert, perhaps not far from Los Angeles.  Anyway, the Stooges encounter a 50 foot spider that emits a jet of flames.  Then a futuristic flying car materializes in a puff of smoke, and the Stooges board the car, and it takes them to a laboratory.  Once in the laboratory, the Stooges encounter a talking robot with four arms (people inside the cubical robot, with their arms inserted into the robot's arms).  And so on, and so on.

At the start of the picture we are introduced to a female Ph. D.-level rocket scientist.  The director and screenwriter are to be commended for putting a female in this prominent role in a movie made way back when (1959).  Another scientist, a young Robert Colbert, is shown wooing the female.  The appearance of Robert Colbert was quite startling to me.  Many Americans know him as a co-star, with James Darrin, in the TIME TUNNEL television series from the 1960s.  TIME TUNNEL was an excellent science fiction series (I recommend the episode showing the Trojan Horse, the episode in occupied France during World War II, and the French Revolution episode).

HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL also includes a lengthy plumbing episode, taken from one of the Stooges earlier short features about plumbers.  The plumbing episode, which includes floods and a multitude of strangely arranged pipes and joints, does not really fit into the story.  One gets the overall impression that the Stooges were running short on comedic ideas.  HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL lacks the zaniness of some of the Stooges' earlier efforts, or the later film, THREE STOOGES IN ORBIT.  TWO STARS.",1188950400,2,2383,4.820197044334975
646029,5,6303442358,"""Have Rocket Will Travel"" kicked off the first in the series of feature films with Larry,Moe and Curly Joe. You know something, this was a funny film to kick off this series! Typical Stooge humor throughout with lots of eye poking, head banging numskull fun. They also sing quite well with the opening theme! I am hoping Columbia Tristar will release this on DVD since I have the other Three Stooges DVD movies from the early to mid 1960s. Enjoy!!",1188345600,2,447,4.6
646030,3,6303442358,"The Three Stooges had resurgence in popularity when television discovered them.  Television led to movies, and ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"" attempted to capitalize in their new-found fame.  Unfortunately, much of the plot is rehash, and the science fiction parts are sadly dated.  Strangely, I still like this movie and have watched it a couple of times.  I think I just liked the Three Stooges.

This incarnation of the Stooges starred original Stooges Moe Howard and Larry Fine and new Stooge Joe DeRita as Curly-Joe.  The Stooges are working as janitors for the National Space Foundation.  Mr. Morse (Jerome Cowan) and Dr. Ingrid Naarveg (Anna-Lisa) are faced with the failure of their rockets because of inefficient fuel.  The boys are enamored of Dr. Naarveg and sneak into the lab at night to make a fuel consisting of a combination of unlikely ingredients.  Mr. Morse catches the Stooges in the lab and chases them into the rocket, which they had just fueled with their new mixture.  Mr. Morse ignites the rocket, which then propels the Stooges to Venus.

Venus looks suspiciously like Earth, including breathable air.  The Stooges encounter a giant spider, a talking unicorn (voiced by veteran actor Dal McKennon), and a super robot.  The super robot had been created by Venusians, which promptly turned all the Venusians into electrical energy (there's gratitude for you).  Unfortunately, the robot then got lonely.  The super robot creates three robots based on the Stooges to keep itself company.  Of course, the three robots behave exactly like the original Stooges.

After some rehashed zaniness the Stooges are able to escape from the robot.  They meet the talking unicorn and the four of them return to Earth, where they are celebrated as heroes.  After a ticker tape parade the Stooges attend a party where mayhem ensues.  The mayhem is a rehash of some of the mayhem of the golden years as Stooges, but there are some funny moments.

One other person of interest in this movie is Robert Colbert as Dr. Naarvig's love interest Dr. Ted Benson.  Colbert is a veteran actor with dozens of television credits into the 1990s.  A couple of interest roles were as Dr. Douglas Phillips in the 1960s series ""The Time Tunnel"" and as Stuart Brooks in the daytime soap ""The Young and the Restless.""

As a comedy I am unable to recommend this movie.  If you are a Stooges fan, as I am, you will probably want this film, even though it is a weak entry in the Stooges portfolio.  I suspect that children might like this movie, but be advised that children often enjoy imitating the physical stunts that the Stooges perform in this movie, stunts that require significant control to ensure no one gets hurt.

It is unfortunate that a comedy trio that created dozens of classic film shorts were recycled into this film.  However, sometimes weak Stooges are better than no Stooges at all.",1121212800,3,2883,4.864476386036961
646031,5,6303442358,"""The Three Stooges""have returned to the movies in a big way in January,1959. As they finally become the stars of their first feature length film:""Have Rocket Will Travel!"".In this spoof of outrageous sci fi films and America's space program. The trio are inept janitors for ""The National Space Foundation"".Where the head of the program:""Mr. Morse""(Jerry Cowan)is having troubles trying to get his rockets off the ground and into space. When the third model has failed to make it's entry into space.""Morse"" and his leading scientist""Dr. Narvig""(Virna Lisi)are told by their superiors""By the next meeting of the board.

The boys sneak into the lab late one night and they inadvertedly create their own rocket fuel With a weird mixture of liquid hydrogene,kerosine,borrillium,popcorn and sugar. They pump the fuel into the ship. But ""Mr. Morse""catches the boys messing around in the lab and chases them into the rocket.""Morse""turns on the rocket's controls and sends ""The Stooges""on a runaway trip to the planet Venus. Where they meet a friendly talking unicorn(Voiced by Dallas McKennon),a fire breathingh spider. And an evil talking robot(Voiced by Larry Fine's Son In Law Don Lamond).Who uses the boys as prototypes  for three evil robotic doubles of the trio for the purpose of conquering the earth. The team and ""Uni The Talking Unicorn""manage to escape the mainical robots and head back to earth. Where they're hailed as heroes. The Stooges are still able to perform their slapstick with great ease and skill in this picture and they also show off their talents as singers. As they perform the film's title tune. The movie also has some fine special effects and a no holds barred slapstick finale that tops ""Hoi Polli""in it's parodying high society parties and all of their ridicules pomp and circumstance. Mr. Lamond also makes a brief guest appearance at the end of the film as a newspaper reporter. And The New third Stooge:Vaudville and Burlesque vetrain Joe De Rita helps Moe & Larry in their assults on science,high society,sci fi movies and pompus employers. The only annoyence in this movie is again the use of two romantic leads:Ms. Lisi and(a pre ""Time Tunnel"") Robert Colbert as the scientist and the foundation's resident shrink. Who do little more than try to bill and coo for the teenage set. Nevertheless.""The Three Stooges""invite us all to join them on their wild trek to Venus and Of Course. We 're still enjoying the ride to this day.",1046908800,,2625,4.993150684931507

7847052,3,6303442358,"After having a batch of their old short films with Curly Howard released to tv in the late 1950s, the Three Stooges were back in demand and Columbia Pictures finally gave Moe Howard and Larry Fine the opportunity they always wanted for all the years they were making shorts--the chance to star in feature length films.

Joining Moe & Larry as the new 3rd stooge was showbusiness veteran Joe Derita, nicknamed Curly-Joe--presumably because of his somewhat physical resemblance to Curly Howard.

And the thing you might notice with this new stooge lineup is that these are not the stooges of old back when they were in their prime with Curly and Shemp. In fact, these stooges are old & maybe with old age came a softer approach. Whether or not that's a good thing is a matter of personal taste, I suppose--although I would point out the problem with the majority of the Derita era was the softer approach & how the stooges seemed to have gotten pegged during this point in their careers as being just ""Children's entertainers.""

Definitely, the cutesy talking unicorn angle of this movie seemed expressly aimed at pleasing the younger kids in the crowd--although if you're like me, you know that when the stooges were in their prime, their act with Curly and Shemp was hardly cute and whimsical. Indeed, during those days, a little petty larceny by the stooges was considered a good thing.

Who knows what the stooges could have done if they had been given the chance to make features during the 1930s, 40s, or 50s, but ""Have Rocket"" was not exactly the greatest vehicle they made, but it does have its moments.

7847053,3,6303442358,"THE THREE STOOGES-HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL: Generation after generation, THE THREE STOOGES have always been the small fry set's most beloved comedy team (not to mention adult males'), but their first full length feature as headliners, 1959's HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL, seems more squarely aimed at kids than ever. Rotund CURLY JOE DERITA, the team's third and final replacement member, fills the spacesuit if not the enormous void left by the late CURLY HOWARD (only his brother SHEMP came close)...it's impossible to ignore the original CURLY's trademark ""Woo woo woo!"" mysteriously dubbed into the soundtrack at one point as DERITA descends a ladder. Many of THE STOOGES' slapstick routines are revisited as they accidentally soar to Venus, where they encounter a giant laser spitting tarantula, a talking unicorn, a multi-armed robot and their own alien clones. Back on earth, the conquering heroes trash a fancy dinner party as only they can, although a seemingly inevitable pie fight climax never materializes. This fractured flick helped launch a successful revival for the team...so for that triumph alone, a few missing pies are ""coitenly"" excusable.
