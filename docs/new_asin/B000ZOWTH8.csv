Daniel Newsome is well known in the swing dancing community and they do a great job at breaking down the steps. Unless you are taking private dance lessons, this instructional video will teach anything you could learn in a class. Much better than anything I could find on YouTube.",1498867200,,452,4.6625
8236264,5,B000ZOWTH8,"Volume 2 is even better than volume 1.  The trick are even bigger and more impressive.

I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves.  Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Tiffiny break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy.  This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does.  I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series.",1333411200,,672,4.387096774193548
8236265,5,B000ZOWTH8,"I'm not saying you shouldn't get basic training or know what you're doing beforehand. But seriously, don't be afraid to try out these moves! They're so much fun! I feel like a whole new world of dance has just been opened to me. I was never very, let's say ballsy, with my dancing (I usually stuck to modern and tap) But buying this series and getting into this style of dance has been a BLAST!

There's so much energy on the dance floor at swing clubs!

I definitely think you should get the first DVD in the series, just to be on the safe side. Plus, they use moves from the first tape in this one, so it will help you out. Daniel and Tiffany are great, too.",1307577600,,660,4.1484375
8236266,5,B000ZOWTH8,As good as volume #1. I don't know where else you can find this level instruction. Completely worth the purchase.,1215129600,,113,4.7
