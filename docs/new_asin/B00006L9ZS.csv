7971278,3,B00006L9ZS,"The plot of this feature has to do with a woman reporter hires a small men crowd to fly deep into the Amazon jungle and find an anthropologist that may be still be alive. This movie is a descent adventure movie aimed to show the trade of animal species, slavery, and child organ's traffic. Thus, this feature goes more along the lines of ""Massacre on Dinosaur Valley"" than to Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, as Vipco's misleading cover art and title seem to suggest. This is NOT a cannibal entry. You will not see a single cannibal or a single scene implying cannibalism (in case you are interested, there is not a single sex scene either). This is not the first time I see this misguiding from Vipco (see my commentary on Massacre on Dinosaur Valley). By the way, the only relationship between this movie and the original Cannibal Holocaust is that both have to do with the Amazon jungle.

The good things about this movie have to do with an excellent photography and a good camera work overall. Technically, picture quality is good to excellent. Format is widescreen and running time is about 86 minutes. Audio is in English (dubbed), and no subtitles are provided. Extras include some trailers.",1335139200,3,1203,4.755980861244019
