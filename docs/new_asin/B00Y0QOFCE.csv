7204828,4,B00Y0QOFCE,"Identical transfer to 2008 Fox release (and subsequent releases, both in the US and through Fox International but not identical to the Fox Pathe Europa release which you'd already have if you wanted it) with one difference:  A free Ultraviolet copy. I ordered to pull the code and will be passing the disc on to a friend who hates UV and everything it stands for. :)

Update:  The code didn't work so I had to involve the UV distributor in order to get my copy. First off, this almost never happens with UV. No Ultraviolet copy of Hitman Unrated was added to my account and no explanation was given as to why so I had to contact my preferred vendor (I prefer Vudu for ease of use and what I consider a superior interface as well as stellar customer service) and then they, in turn, had to contact the studio to get them to honor the code as labeled, for an Ultraviolet copy of Hitman Unrated. I explained that I prefer not to have to return this Blu-ray as a dud with a dead code, if at all possible and I'd appreciate it if they could attempt to get the studio to approve redemption, sent in my pictures of the disc and unique code and then waited. It took three days but they were able to get the studio to release an alternate code so we could try again and, sure enough, I got my unrated version. It is possible that this was just a hiccup in the system and, as such, I do think this is a great deal, however, be mindful that this is a possible failing on this item and you should attempt to redeem you code as soon as possible if you intend to at any point. Upon entering, if your code fails to procure the film, you should immediately contact your vendor to resolve the issue so that you still have the option of returning the disc and faulty code, should there be any problem getting you a code that works. Please don't settle for anything less than what you have paid for. When we allow companies to screw us, we are encouraging them to screw everyone else, simply by complying and letting them know they can get away with it.

Good luck with this item. I hope it works out for you.",1439596800,5,2090,4.243718592964824

7204852,4,B00Y0QOFCE,"I'm biased. I think Timothy Olyphant is a brilliant actor. The plot was thin, but it's a good action movie. He stays true to his secret role until everything goes awry, then it literally explodes.",1469750400,,196,4.628571428571429
7204853,5,B00Y0QOFCE,"As a rule, movies based on videogames are terrible. Even the rare, exceptionally good ones usually only succeed by way of cheating. That is, if the game already had a distinctly cinematic flair to it (Prince of Persia, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil...) then the movie is essentially guaranteed to be as good as what it's emulating. Trouble is, that familiarity formula backfires more often than not, and we end up with a pale stereotype of something better with no identity of its own. Hitman is a dark horse. It's working off the formula of macho bad-ass action movies in the vein of The Transporter, Fast & the Furious, and Bad Boys. That's a low bar, and this should fall lower. However, where it finds its identity is in how it takes itself far more seriously and gets away with it. The plot is surprisingly intelligent. At first, it seems like a confusing mess, almost badly-told, a victim of editing-by-committee, but that's only because most action films in this style pound exposition into your head and spell out every little detail as though you've got the attention span of a fruit fly on Red Bull. Hitman moves at its own pace and leaves it up to you to march in step to it, and it works. It lets the characters be characters instead of pulling double-duty as storytellers. All the tropes are present: sleazy drug lords, hard-boiled detectives, finger-tenting puppeteer villains, audience-identification character... nothing you haven't seen, and the movie not only knows this, but respects it too. The actors are all cast to type but mostly not well-known enough to be distracting. Olyphant is the linchpin to this whole affair, and he never misses a beat, never mugs, and never feels like an actor enjoying what he does way too much. Word is Olyphant only took the job in order to buy a house after his TV series was abruptly cancelled, but you'd never guess from the performance, and definitely not from the outtakes. He takes the job seriously and you believe he's a professional killer trying to redeem himself. It's tempting to call the film a hidden gem or even an underappreciated masterpiece, and while I was certainly surprised when it was recommended to me not only as good, but by a friend who normally isn't big on action movies oozing machismo, I don't think it's going to earn any real vindication or even much of a cult following. This is sad, because I'd love it if more action movies took cues from Hitman.",1469577600,5,2433,4.727058823529412

7204855,4,B00Y0QOFCE,"I've never played the video game nor read any of the graphic novels.  I caught the movie on cable and liked it.  In my opinion, Timothy Olyphant was miscast as the lead, however Dougray Scott and Olga Kurylenko were great.  I liked the storyline very much.

7204871,5,B00Y0QOFCE,"What a great movie that took me till Dec 2015 to get around to watching it. Wow does the time fly by. any hoo for the small review. It's a great story and acting. But hey who doesn't like Timothy Olyphant? He played that part so well. Which I'm sure is why he pulled of the TV series of Justified without a hitch. Based on the video game it was a great adaptation of it as well as added story in the mix. I picked this film up extra cheap at Christmas time and sense I missed the film in theaters years ago. It was like going there on the cheap. My friends and family that joined me in watching it felt like it was better then going to the theater and made for a better experience and involvement in watching this film.
Highly recommended film to watch.",1452038400,2,753,4.094594594594595
7204872,2,B00Y0QOFCE,Hitman is one of my favorite video game series. Even though this movie does do some nods to the game series it still was not good. The story itself was boring and Timothy did not play a good Agent 47.,1451606400,,200,4.025
7204873,5,B00Y0QOFCE,"This is one of my favorite films, to me it seem like this film was more so real-world but with a relation to the Hitman Games, I loved this film! Plus the woman they choose is beautiful which also made the film stand-out. Hitman Unrated is really a film that can be watched repeatedly for its intelligent and action is not boring. The skills offered in this film seem much more professional which matched the Hitman Games. In addition the plot was very well orchestrated, somewhat similar to the Jet Li film Kiss of the Dragon and Romeo Must Die, similar to the film Taken and also The Bodyguard; were a professional rescues a beautiful woman with his line of profession.",1449878400,,671,4.553719008264463
7204874,5,B00Y0QOFCE,"I absolutely love this movie.  It's a little violent but with the title name, Hitman, it's expected!  My only complaint is this it wasn't long enogh.  I wanted to continue to see the action because it was that good!",1448928000,,215,4.461538461538462
7204875,3,B00Y0QOFCE,"Unnecessary nudity (isn't it all?).  I'm a fan of Olyphant from his role in Justified.  He plays the role fairly well.  I've only played 1.5 of the hit man games, but the plot seems in line with the games I played.  Good twists and turns, but obviously this is more of an action flick than a thinking man's movie.  Decent for what it is, and OK for $5.00.  Note, the unrated version was not the reason for the nudity.",1448150400,6,417,4.215189873417722

Timothy just played it all-out, and, with a fine supporting cast, it over-shadowed the small plot holes and script problems. While watching this brand-new Blu-Ray release, I remember saying ""wow"" out loud several times because of the beauty of the cinematography in the wider shots.",1441929600,5,443,4.842105263157895
7204879,5,B00Y0QOFCE,"This I don't understand
The Original Uncut Blu Ray of Hitman was close to flawless it has a Beautiful HD picture and sound
why put out a second print???? For quick cash
This ""newer"" version  seems to have no new exclusive content  (Except the new Artwork which I really like but, I've double dipped enough on movies!)
Not even sure why it was made
You'd think 20th Century Fox would be better at handling there money (But, with the Fanatic Four re-boot (Bomb) and the upcoming Agent 47 (Re-boot and The Transporter Re-boot it's Clear the higher ups at 20th Century Fox are asleep at the wheel or just don't give a damn
Both these upcoming Films look Horrible
The first print of Hitman (from 2008) is really good despite having no audio commentary by anyone  but, its Unrated/Uncut
The Transfer is really nice it looks HD it's a flat out stunning film!  The locations, the sets, the lighting, everything screams European made
(which is no way a bad thing)  That's what makes this film such a ambitious piece of art  @ times it looks like Leon The Professional
Xavier Gens has a  good eye  and a competent  Director
the Original BR version also comes with a second disc a dvd which includes a portable digital copy of Hitman

Hitman is a 2007 Action film adapted from a popular video game series
As far as video game adaptions it's one of the most under-rated
On paper it's super hard to write a story around Agent 47 due to the character being super bland
(Not a bad fictional video game character but, a product of the times)
This films works 'Cause it tries to build on a interesting backstory that came later on in the life of the Game Series
Timothy Olyphant shaved his head and took this gig and He does a great job (As crazy as it sounds I strongly believe this role helped him get the lead in FX's  Justified 3 years later) he did a lot with very little
Olga Kurylenko plays Nika Boroninav  (She's a Eastern European Model turned actress)  what's else can you say she's Flawless and Stunning
She's Not in league with  Meryl Streep as far as her acting ability but, she's also not a train wreck like Cindy Crawford was on the big screen
Robert Knepper is as always great (He can take any role and add his ""own"" spin to it)
the rest of the cast is mostly European and they are all very good
the film has lots of style and substance
The Locations work for the film due to the fact in the games you go all over the globe to kill the targets you're payed to take out!
It's 94 minutes and it moves super quick
Really not sure why this film gets so much hate!?!?!
Who hates it Action Film Fans???  or Video Game Fans ???
Granted it's no Need for Speed but, what really can be as good as that!

After Hitman Agent 47 bombs at the box office this film will get more respect for what it was and what it tried to do!
I really enjoy this film it's not in any way new or unique but, it borrows from other films the right way!
It can stand on it's own for a strong action film and that's hard to do in a post Expendables III era  8.8/10
If you have the original Blu Ray of Hitman you don't need this
If you never bought the first one...... Is this worth the 50 cents  more price  I guess that depends on what Cover Art you dig more
They are both the same except this new version comes with a Digital HD Code (the older version you get a dvd w/ digital copy
it's your call.  Regardless no matter what  you chose discover this fun little film and enjoy it for what it does right and don't focus on the little short comings some people might be quick to point out",1439856000,20,3552,4.232592592592592
