5360713,5,B009POCG22,"Considering that they somehow created an entire season of Mystery INC without any direction and screwed it up, and that Big Top wasn't half bad but not the greatest, Mask Of The Blue Falcon hits the spot nicely.
It's certainly better than Music of the Vampire.
It's a worthy purchase, and i'd say feel free to stream it on here and buy the disc, you should want this one in your collection.
It's hard to top Camp Scare or Witch's Ghost. .
Camp Scare, Legend Of The Vampire, Zombie Island, Cyber Chase, Alien Invaders, Legend of the Phantosaur, and Witch's Ghost finally have some company in terms of quality. 2013 is starting out right for Scooby after a ho hum last year.
As long as I never see another Arabian Nights, i'll be fine. NEVER spend money on Arabian Nights, it's the one scooby you'd only have for completeness.",1358035200,14,824,4.5369127516778525

Cute movie!
This release features Blue Falcon and Dynomutt (BF & D). BF & D have worked with Scooby-Doo and the gang previously in the Scooby-Doo!/Dynomutt hour. I love BF & D. Also, BF & D appear in the current series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated.
The opening credits are great. Notice that Hanna-Barbera (HB) characters fight Scooby monsters. It's done in comic book style with great spy movie music (think Bond).
At first, I thought Adam West was the voice of old BF. It is Jeff Bennett voicing BF. He was the voice of the nerdy guy in Loch Ness & Chill Out (Dale Chillman) among others.
Watch carefully. See how many characters you can identity from previous releases (like the costumed vampire with whom Shaggy interacts in the movie lobby from Music of the Vampire). Also, from Music of the Vampire & Big Top Scooby-Doo!, notice the lead singers from both movies walking together in the party scene.
This release is a virtual Who's Who of Boomerang cartoon characters (HB characters). See how many you can spot. I had to go back to spot the Jonny Quest characters.
If you liked Pirates Ahoy!, you'll like this one.

I PURCHASED Mask Of the Blue Falcon for me and my granddaughter. We own nearly every Scooby-Doo episode that's ever been released on DVD and every movie too. It's a collection I started in 2011 when my granddaughter was born, so it was a given to add BF. What I didn't expect was how much she loves BF! As a child of the 70's-80's myself, I loved Scooby-Doo, BF, and Adam West as Batman. Now my 5-year-old granddaughter adores Blue Falcon.

The movie opens with the gang in the Mystery Machine. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are making edible BF and Dog Wonder costumes to wear to the Mega-Mondo-Pop-Cartoon-ConApalooza, being held in Cali-Forn-I-A. They can't wait to get there to meet their heroes ....Owen Garrison, the original Blue Falcon, and his loyal, crime fighting dog, Dynomutt- Dog Wonder. Upon arrival, Daphne, who does not ""get"" Shaggy and Scooby's love of comic books, goes into shopping mode - buying every ""littlest fuzzy"" not already in her extensive collection. (She has a print out of the ones she owns- it goes on forever.) Fred wants to see the preview of the New Blue Falcon movie and Velma wants a mystery to solve. (She doesn't have to wait long.)

The evil Mr. Hyde is determined to ruin the big movie premiere. All the evidence points to the original BF. The beloved Owen Garrison. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy forever running away from danger and mystery solving are determined to prove Owen Garrison's innocence.

It's wonderful to see Shaggy and Scooby-Doo put their fears aside. The rest of the gang are pretty sure Garrison is responsible for the Mr. Hyde attacks. But soon enough the real villain is revealed and everyone is happy at the end.

I loved the surroundings in this movie. There are all kinds of posters scattered throughout and other comic fans dressed up in easily recognizable costumes of beloved characters from the 70's -80's. Yeah, I didn't like Owen Garrison being portrayed as an angry, bitter, forgotten ""star,"" desperate to be beloved again. But, it all works out in the end. (As it is supposed too, this IS Scooby.)

If you are a Scooby-Doo fan you gotta add this to your collection. If you loved Blue Falcon...you'll want this in your collection. If we had to pick our top 3 favorites are Camp Scare, Goblin King, and Abracadabra-Doo. Mask doesn't quite reach the same cinematic level as our favs - it is more of a ""retro-hit,"" paying homage to beloved characters from 70s-80s and 90's. But it certainly has made my granddaughter a die-hard BF fan. So much so, this is the second copy I've purchased.

Mask of The Blue Falcon is fun for the whole family!",1485216000,2,2602,4.71806167400881

5360742,4,B009POCG22,"Released in 2013, SCOOBY-DOO! THE MASK OF BLUE FALCON is nineteenth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.  In this release, Shaggy takes the gang to Mega Mondo Pop Comic ConApalooza, where he and Scooby enter the costume contest as their favorite comic and television show heroes, Blue Falcon and Dynomutt.  They are anxious to meet Owen Garrison, who played Blue Falcon in an earlier television series; Freddie wants to see the new Blue Falcon movie, which has left Owen in the dust, and Daphne is eager to purchase stuffed toy collectibles.  Velma is bored by the whole thinguntil she discovers the ConApalooza has been attacked by a mysterious entity named Mr. Hyde, the comic book nemesis of Blue Falcon.

No one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons, either old or new, of being great art, but the premise and characters (inspired, it is said, by a mixture of the radio and television series I LOVE A MYSTERY and THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS) are usually well done, and BLUE FALCON is especially clever.  The ConApalooza provides plenty of amusing swipes at such venues and plenty of chances to revisit old Hannah-Barbera cartoon characters like Frankenstein Jr. and The Herculoids.  This time it is very easy to spot the bad guy, but the plot is unexpectedly twisty.  It is all a lot of fun.  Recommended for fans both old and new.

I knew who done it near the beginning of the cartoon. What makes Scooby-Doo fun to watch is trying to figure out who done it towards the end of the program, not at the beginning. I didn't like the way the Blue Falcon was depicted. He was one of my favorite cartoon characters from the '70's/'80's. He was portrayed as a vengeful, crotchety old guy with a bone to pick with the world.

The new stuff, with Grey Delisle and Mindy Cohn, is well animated, snarky fun, and this movie is no exception.

We enjoyed it. Was it the best Scooby ever? No. But it holds its own and has some very funny scenes starring a disgruntled former television star who is clearly meant as an homage to Adam West, among other things.

5360774,4,B009POCG22,"Well, if you follow my reviews you already know what Scooby films I like best. (""Pirates Ahoy,"" ""Camp Scare,"" and ""The Goblin King."" )

The best way I can start is to say that this 19th chapter is not a defining film like ""Pirates Ahoy,"" but it is surprisingly well done and deep.

I call # 10 ""Pirates Ahoy"" the defining film because an innocent sea cruise turns into a dire situation when Fred's parents were kidnapped. Fred (the leader) finds himself on his own (except for the gang of course) and one other person, Velma's perception finds some important clues, at one point Daphne (in a girly fashion) helps them. (She cuts ropes with her credit card.) Shaggy and Scooby start off in their comical and cowardly fashion, but they rise to the occasion and help save the day. And Fred steers the gang through a dangerous situation, and saves everyone. Fred also gives Scooby the final command to take them home, and Scooby gets the last word.

Alright. This 19th movie is different, and not the defining film. But it explores a lot of interesting themes. Scooby and Shaggy go with some enthusiasm to a comic book convention to see their favorite (and aging) actor who did the original Blue Falcon. And he is very sad and frustrated, because the newer and younger Blue Falcon is not only taking the attention away from him, but certain powers have intentionally played down the older actor's time as BF. (Even to the point of no longer allowing him to wear the costume in public.) Also, his show wasn't put on DVD. Certain powers just want his contributions erased. :(

This is an obvious parallel of Adam West's 60s Batman versus the new Batman. The Adam West character may have disturbing rages, but somehow, we never lose our sympathy for him.

Then we have a problem. A seeming 'comic book villain' ( who was an enemy of the Blue Falcon in the comic book) comes to haunt the comic book convention.

I don't want to say too much and ruin the film for those who haven't seen it. But another theme in this film is political corruption. The mayor is pretty repulsive. He preaches noble intentions, but we see that he is more driven by economics. When a situation (with some symbolism) affects the mayor directly, he in an annoying manner throws a tantrum and acts like the slime attack was Scooby and the gang's fault. He dismisses them, but then they stay on the case anyway, and solve the mystery. Then after everyone else has done the work, he pretends he never lost faith in Scooby. Some may find this funny or political survival. Others may find it dishonorable and annoying. (But it's probably realistic.)

Another interesting thing this film discusses is system and guns. People seem to feel so confident once they are in a system and carry guns. It's almost rewarding when the 'bad guy' effortlessly defeats the system.

What else? The security head is worth some attention. He's not the most likable character. But it's hard to dislike him. He's just an ordinary guy trying to do his job in a difficult situation. And the politics involved are only making it harder for him.

Another subject discussed here is betrayal. I can't disclose all the details. (That would ruin it for those who haven't seen it.) But sometimes our closest friend, or someone we think we can trust is the one ready to thrust the knife in our back.

Perhaps the most touching lesson is that Scooby (despite  his weaknesses) doesn't lose faith in himself or his hero. And this helps him to 'find the hero in himself.'

This is something I have to be delicate with (so as not to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it). But if you felt really sorry for the 'Adam West' character, there is an ending that is not only rewarding, it is very touching. It will have you cheering, and you may feel your eyes tearing up with joy.

On a side note, some of us Adam West ""Batman"" fans may be hoping that this Scooby film is a prelude to Adam West's ""Batman"" FINALLY being released on DVD.

One final note worth mentioning is that at the comic book convention, there are many people disguised as cartoon characters from the 70s.

So, while this is not exactly a defining Scooby film like ""Pirates Ahoy,"" this 19th chapter of Scooby Doo is well worth watching. My favorites of ""Pirates Ahoy,"" ""Goblin King,"" and ""Camp Scare"" are in no danger of losing their top spots with me. But this 19th chapter was really great.",1382400000,2,4399,4.564720812182741

And so to Mask of the Blue Falcon, a movie literally dripping with 'nudge nudge/wink winks' to the geekier parents out there. The Scooby Gang visit a thinly veiled San Diego Comic Con to find the original, semi-retired, Blue Falcon, an Adam West-esque actor out of work and desperately trying to sell autographs, whilst a new, grittier Blue Falcon movie is being promoted by a Tom Cruise a-like actor. (The 're-booted' Frank Miller-esque Blue Falcon comes across like Christian Bale's Batman ramped up to 11.) Naturally, the original Blue Falcon becomes prime suspect when an evil Mr Hyde starts tearing up the convention, and in the process of doing so, allows the film-makers to touch on the eccentricities of the convention floor, homage John Romita's 'Spider-man no more' cover with Scooby dumping his cosplay costume in the bin, and poke fun at the shallowness of the Hollywood cultural machine.

And so, the movie is clever, but it never quite shakes off the DTV vibe. Partly I wonder if this is to do with the mandate of following the Scooby 'formula', probably laid down by the studio (certainly, Mystery Incorporated feels fresher). Or Perhaps it's because the usual Scooby Doo story beats have to be stretched out to feature length, as opposed to being wrapped up in 30 minutes. In any case, the nods to the nerd-parents out there certainly were engaging, if not enthralling.

But I probably expect too much. The production team know what is required of them by Warner Bros, and still manage to shoehorn in a lot of clever little quirks, enough to make this painless. And, excusing the terrible voice for Scooby (seriously, there has to be a better actor out there more able to emulate the classic Scooby 'voice'), this movie, whilst not being genuinely innovative, is certainly far above the lowest, eyeball gnawing, pits of hell that many ""kids' movies"" seem to exist in. Finally, there are plenty of relevant extras, including three episodes of the 'classic' cartoon (with Scrappy Doo *shudder*).

And your son or daughter will probably love it regardless!",1365033600,,4123,6.786389413988658

5360804,5,B009POCG22,"This movie isn't necessarily what I was assuming it would be back in late 2012 when I initially heard of it's upcoming release. I originally thought that the movie would bring back the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt and have the duo team up with Scooby and company to solve a mystery of some sort. Instead, the movie is about Shaggy and Scooby's obsession WITH Blue Falcon and Dynomutt...throughout the majority of the movie Scooby is wearing a Dynomutt costume while Shaggy wears a blue shirt with the letter F on it as an honor to his super hero idol, Blue Falcon.

As always, my reviews feature several spoilers so for those who hadn't seen the movie and do not want to know how things turn out you shouldn't read the remaining of the commentary.

The movie's opening sequence is great. It's patterned after the live action Batman series of the '60s. The action of the movie centers around a comic book convention in California. The event is known more officially as 'Comic Con' but for humor the convention has an outlandish name. Since the movie is set inside a venue housing a comic book convention it makes full use of cartoon characters from a number of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Not only are there posters all over the walls promoting classic programs such as The Mighty Mightor and Hong Kong Phooey but in typical conventioneer behavior we see fans and enthusiasts showing up in costume as their favorite cartoon characters. Blink and you'll probably miss a dozen characters parading across the screen inside the convention center.

I spotted an assortment of fans dressed as Zan and Jayna from the Super Friends; I saw a really quick shot of a fan dressed as Apache Chief and Samurai, both from the Super Friends. There's also some screen shots of people dressed as Space Ghost, Coil Man from The Impossibles, and then there are more posters lining the walls.

As mentioned, Scooby and Shaggy dress up as Dynomutt and Blue Falcon. Along for the ride is, of course, the rest of the gang: Fred, Daphne, and Velma.

The overall theme of the movie is a comment on agism in Hollywood as well as the decades long practice of generational irreverence where celebrities and pop-culture from one generation is held in contempt and ridicule by another generation.

News surfaces that there will be a brand new, ultra-modern depiction of the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt. This generational irreverence I mentioned is highlighted by the fact that Fred and Daphne can't wait to see this updated version of Blue Falcon...while Shaggy and Scooby prefer the traditional characterizations while Velma's basically non-interested in the goings-on until she senses a mystery on the horizon when the villainous Mr. Hyde shows up and unleashes his uncontrollable anger on the city. This 'mystery' turns out to, on the surface, tie in with the upcoming movie of Blue Falcon.

As is the case with the Scooby television series, there are several red herring characters who are designed to appear to have a motive for being the villain but turn out innocent. This red herring treatment is given to a couple who are all too eager to receive publicity for the upcoming movie. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy meet the original Blue Falcon at an autograph table.

The actor, Owen Garrison, is bitter over the movie's producers overlooking him and forbidding him to wear the Blue Falcon costume during public appearances. The more dedicated of fans will immediately recognize that the name, Owen Garrison, is a reference to the original voice actor of Blue Falcon, Gary Owens.

In addition to Owen Garrison we also get to meet a character named Joe Rabble who states that he's a friend of Owen's as well as an autograph signing partner.

Throughout the movie Garrison is often caught in embarrassing situations as his anger overtakes him and he unleashes his jealousy and annoyance over the 'new' Blue Falcon and the financial turmoil he's gone through due to television channels dropping reruns of the original cartoon in the lead-up to the newer Blue Falcon. Dynomutt, in reality, doesn't have much of an impact as far as screen time in the movie...he's seen in updated 'clips' of the original series where Frank Welker (the voice of Dynomutt) and Jeff Bennett (the voice of Owen Garrison/Blue Falcon) recreate dialogue lifted from the original Dynomutt series.

While the Hyde monster unleashes his anger all over the city it becomes apparent that Owen Garrison MUST be the villain since he's the only person with enough motive to want to see the new Blue Falcon film burn in flames. Scooby and Shaggy become embarrassed themselves over the way their idol is behaving.

While all of this was happening, security guard Mr. Becker gets involved and shuts down the comic book convention. Shaggy and Scooby later find themselves on the run of a river of green slime that's raging out of control all over the city. Later, the green slime was revealed to be harmless and nothing more than pistachio flavored foam.

Popping in and out of the movie is the Mayor...drawn almost exactly as he was in the Dynomutt series.

Mr. Becker's physical appearance, with a voice patterned after Paul Lynde, is what you might call a combination of Sylvester Sneekley/The Hooded Claw from The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, Mr. Pertwee from Where's Huddles, and Mr. Peevely from The Hair Bear Bunch all rolled into one. Paul Lynde gave voice to the first two characters while John Stephenson used his Joe Flynn impression for Mr. Peevely.

In the meantime, Scooby and Shaggy grow disillusioned when they become a laughing stock on 'Scoob Tube' thanks to their misadventure with the 'raging river of slime' going viral.

The climax of the movie begins at a baseball stadium. It is here where a now giant Mr. Hyde shows up and goes on a rampage. Eventually the giant Hyde monster is defeated, revealed to be a monster robot, and much to the dismay of Shaggy and Scooby, inside the Hyde monster is none other than Owen Garrison!!

Well, the mystery is solved now, yes? Not exactly!

Fred, Daphne, and Velma conclude that Owen couldn't be the Hyde monster because of it being too obvious. Mr. Hyde shows up once more...and this time the original Blue Falcon and Dynomutt arrive in their Falcon Car. Blue Falcon gives Hyde an upper cut...knocking him out. Velma does the honors and rips off the real Mr. Hyde's mask to reveal it to be...Joe Rabble! Remember him? He secretly hated Owen and was bitter over his own failed business exploits in his younger days. As he was being hauled away he delivered the traditional phrase nearly all villains stated in the franchise when they were caught. If you don't know what that phrase is then you're not too terribly familiar with the franchise as most.

As a side note, Owen Garrison's voice, to my ears at least, is patterned after Adam West instead of Gary Owens. The Blue Falcon, after all, was a parody of Batman...and this movie opens with a visual reference to the iconic fight scenes in the '60s television show.

While not a 'team up' movie as I was expecting it's nonetheless an entertaining movie and one filled with a lot of industry jokes and commentary on what generally goes on during a Comic Book Convention...minus the appearance of Mr. Hyde! For those curious, Mr. Hyde is a villain from the SCOOBY-DOO/DYNOMUTT series in 1976. The character appeared just once in an episode titled ""Everybody Hyde"", which featured guest appearances from Scooby and the gang.

Ultimately, I give The Mask of the Blue Falcon five stars. There are so many in-jokes and references to the original series and to Saturday morning television and comic books, in general, from the '70s that it's sure to go over the heads of those not too familiar with classic cartoons. A balloon of '60s cartoon character, Frankenstein Jr., features prominently in one of the movie's action scenes. Also to look for is a hilarious sequence where Fred, Daphne, and Velma dress as members of The Herculoids.",1363737600,,7971,4.837738619676946

I remember Blue Falcon as a REAL HERO in the Scooby World.  I was looking forward to his return and to see a REAL HERO in the movie.  As par for recent movies Hanna Barbara went as far from the truth as the could and delivered a pile of shit.  Worst money I ever spent and actually want to cry at the distruction of myth and disresepct that was present to Blue Falcon and Dynomutt (who is for the most part not in the movie).,1362096000,3,568,4.118181818181818
5360810,3,B009POCG22,"When I first heard about ""Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon,"" I was giddy as a schoolboy. What could be more perfect than a movie combining two of my favorite Hanna-Barbera characters from my childhood?

I would spend many Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons watching Scooby and the gang solve mysteries and then Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, the Dog Wonder, chase down whatever criminal they were up against. After watching this new animated feature, there's one thing that could make it better. It would be nice if it actually featured the super hero and his canine sidekick.

Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Incorporated gang head to California for the annual Mega Mondo Pop Cartoon-a-Con. Shaggy and the crime-solving canine are most excited to meet their favorite actor who portrayed the Blue Falcon. The celebrity's appearance at the convention is overshadowed by the release of a new modernized movie featuring the classic super hero.

A sinister villain named Mr. Hyde is intent on bringing the advanced screening of the new ""Blue Falcon"" film to a grinding halt. Can Scooby and his sleuthing crew capture the ghoulish Mr. Hyde and discover his motives before it's too late?
What we get with ""Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon"" is a movie ABOUT the super hero, but not including him. To say I was disappointed when watching this after seeing the original trailers for the film would be an understatement. That's not to say it isn't hilarious or good. However, I was really looking forward to a team-up reminiscent of ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies.""

Besides the fictional Blue Falcon actor donning the costume momentarily at the end, all we get is some footage from the old show. The rest of the time we get scenes from the ""new and improved"" Blue Falcon and Dynomutt movie. Although it's a hilarious jab at the way super heroes are updated and made current by movie studios, it didn't satisfy me as a viewer.

In the update, Blue Falcon resembles Batman in ""The Dark Knight"" movies and Dynomutt looks like a Cylon mashed up with Ravage from ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" All I could think while watching it was, ""That would be a pretty cool movie!"" Of course Blue Falcon purists and fanboys would cry over this the same way they do about any remake or reboot of an iconic character.

The whole movie takes place at a comic book convention and it does a great job lampooning the pop culture events and the people who attend them. Nothing is held sacred when it comes to poking fun at the different aspects of any comic book convention you'll attend.

There are overweight attendees dressed in ill-fitting super hero costumes, vendors selling over-priced collectibles, old actors trying to make a living off selling autographs, and studios trying to pitch their newest movie releases. It's funny to see Warner Brothers poke fun at themselves.

The high-definition audio and video transfers will please viewers. The picture is clean and vibrantly colored. A 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees sound effects, the musical score, and dialogue are spread out well through your home theater speakers.

Bonus material for ""Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon"" includes three classic cartoons. One of them is from ""The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby-Doo"" and features Vincent Price voicing Vincent Van Ghoul. It also contains an animation-remix music video entitled ""Scooby-Doo Dub Step.""

As an exciting mystery movie featuring the Mystery Incorporated Gang, ""Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon"" gets the job done. It's family fun that will appeal to parents and their children alike. Just don't go into it hoping for a team-up between Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and the Scooby Gang or you'll be as disenchanted as I was.",1361923200,3,3718,4.972624798711755

And at one point, the bad guy hurls a knife (or sword?) at Scooby and it sticks in the ground right next to him. For my young kids, I was not happy to see an actual weapon incorporated into the story. I prefer to keep it to the old school goofy chase scenes with no weapons. The storyline held my 4 year old's attention, but at a couple of points I could tell he was a little scared. The storyline was a little too complicated for my 2 year old and it did not hold her attention, which I was ultimately thankful for. This is one Scooby movie we will not be adding to our collection.
