8397254,4,B003I2GRNQ,"I saw this drama years ago and became very addicted to it. This is a LONG series, 60 episodes, and very emotional but touching. It's basically about two sisters' very different relationships... One with a cheating husband, and one with a freeloading boyfriend who runs into a nice guy from her past. When I saw a DVD set of this still in print, I had to buy it. I have to recommend HanBooks in the Amazon Marketplace for this item and others (books/cd/dvd). I received my order within 1 day and everything was in excellent condition. If you are you interested in this drama, you should get it asap since these things can go out of print forever and disappear quickly.",1330732800,,667,4.520661157024794
