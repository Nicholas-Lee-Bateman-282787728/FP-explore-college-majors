7815097,5,6301798635,"This is an excellent film with a good script, good acting by well-established stars and a good supporting cast.  I thought that when Walter Matthau passed away, this would become available on DVD.  I could never find it.  The copy I received was in excellent condition and, since I still have a serviceable VCR player, I have enjoyed it very much.  It was worth the investment.",1361318400,,377,4.666666666666667
7815098,3,6301798635,"Walter Matthau is at his best as a 60's swinging drunk, and Anne Jackson is charming in this movie that, if remade, could feature Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  One note, I watched this movie on the 'Late Late Late Show' many moons ago, and I think this VHS version of the movie might be an edited version, as I believe the TV version was much 'racier' than this tape.  This tape version is slightly more than a ""G"" but less than a ""PG"", but most certainly not an ""R"" as there is no nudity or vulgar language - everything is merely suggested. So I'm surprised that the tape is probably sanitized, and doesn't merit an ""R"".  Ratings questions aside, it is a cute movie, and a great look back at the late 60's.  A real 'swinging' movie taking you back to the ""Austin Powers"" party times.",1127865600,4,779,4.27891156462585
7815099,5,6301798635,"This is a great movie!  The Secret Life of an American Wife is

is the original Desperate Housewives.  Anne Jackson, Walter

Matthau and Patrick O'Neal are and were the great actors of the

1960's. Just sit back and enjoy it and have a good laugh.",1111104000,5,247,4.4
