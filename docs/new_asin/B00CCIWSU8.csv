8580289,5,B00CCIWSU8,"Purchasing the collectible SteelBook of the Star Wars prequel trilogy is without question the best way to own the worst of the Star Wars movies.  (And I DO mean the worst!)
Everything lousy is made better by the fierce image of Yoda, ready to kick some ass - Even if we know that inside the box is the story of a whiny brat who lets his mother die, slaughters children, and betrays the only ones who ever cared for him.  (Remember when Hayden Christiansen was considered cool?  Yeah, neither do I.)

Anyways, if you are a Star Wars fan as I am, and your cockles ache for JJ Abrams' Episode 7 (as mine do), you will inevitably want to own these three movies as well.  Buy them in the SteelBook.  That way you won't regret throwing the box across the room into the wall in anger the next time a nearly-infant Anakin wins that dumb sand race in Episode 1.  Oh yeah, not to mention every time Jar Jar opens his slimy poop-filled trap.

SteelBooks and Yoda make everything better.",1372982400,8,975,4.377777777777778
