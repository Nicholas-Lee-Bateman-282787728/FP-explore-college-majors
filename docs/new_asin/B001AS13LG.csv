8279296,5,B001AS13LG,"I can't recommend this DVD highly enough, it is well set out, and takes you through all aspects of your camera. I find these type of products much easier to follow than the printed manuals,maybe Sony should be taking note of this and going that route instead? The most important thing for me is there is NO LOUD background music to distract and annoy you. It is a VERY WELL produced product which I would 100% recommend,Having been a photographer for over 20 years, but stopped using an SLR about 10 years ago, this institutional DVD has refreshed my memory and also shown me how things have changed and improved with the developments in DSLR. This disk is tops in my opinion and feel it helps us owners to get to grips with the camera fast (no pun intended) and start to take great pictures immediately.

My advice is BUY IT.

Thanks for reading this review.",1337904000,,859,4.5
8279297,5,B001AS13LG,"I bought the A200 six months ago.  Here's my non-technical assessment (I'm not a pro).  The picture quality is excellent.  In good light, the camera is responsive and does a great job with action shots.  It also seems to handle harsh lighting and backlit subjects very well.  You have flexibility with multi-segment, center weighting and spot metering exposure settings.  When doing landscape shots, I like exposure bracketing and the A200 offers two different methods. I was a little disappointed in how the camera deals with low light ""people shots"" (in one instance I was trying to take twilight and nighttime pictures at a wedding reception held under an outdoor pavillion). I own an older digital Canon EOS Rebel, and I'd say they are about the same. Focusing in poor light is a bit balky with both cameras, which can cause you to miss some shots.  Back on a positive note, the A200 has an eye-start AF option that is very cool, IF you can get used to it.  It starts auto-focus when you put the camera to your eye.  But I keep forgetting and half-pressing the shutter release like I do on my Canon EOS.  If I worked exclusively with the A200, I'd probably get over this.  Image stabalization works well and makes a big difference in the clarity of telephoto shots.

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone.  Unless you are a professional looking for more advanced features, almost any capability the average home user wants is included along with many capabilities they'll never use.  At the end of the day, all I want is a good picture and this camera delivers in most circumstances.",1231372800,,1616,4.704626334519573
