8737690,5,B002RR1JVS,"This dvd is worth any price. I was disappointed with the first volume but not with this volume. Volume 2 blows anything GGW has done before that I have seen. Can't wait to get the rest of the series. The two stand-outs of this volume is Meggan and Martika, for more of Martika (and the best) watch the bonus features. All I can say is HOT... HOT.. HOT. I very much recommend this dvd.",1277078400,,384,4.202702702702703
