8274942,5,B0019Q8R5O,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is Night of the Living Dead overhauled with a silly plotline and overdubbed voices. The only negative about it are the segments that were filmed and interspersed throughout the movie. They slow down the movie and are not very entertaining or humorous. Overall though this movie is great and if you can find it GET IT!!!,1486512000,,367,4.575757575757576
8274943,5,B0019Q8R5O,"This spoof is a must see.  I have personally seen this movie well over 50 times now and each time you pick up on something you missed the last time.  It's gotten so bad that I can't even watch Night of the Living Dead without doing voices and quoting this movie.  My buddy bought this on VHS when some movie store was going out of business and since then we have worn out the video by watching it WAYYYYY too much.  I have shown it to all my friends and family and have yet to meet someone who didn't like it.  Even if you don't enjoy this movie, I'm quite certain that you know someone who will enjoy it.  Just give 'er a watch.",1355184000,,629,4.032258064516129
8274944,5,B0019Q8R5O,"You either love or hate the film. People sometimes become very passionate about their love for this film. Hence this ""review"". I personally believe that it is a must see film regardless of the outcome. Even if you hate it it is an experience not to be missed. Gives the displeased an opportunity to ponder how could people passionately love the film. I personally could not stop laughing the first time I saw the film and on many repeated viewings I would notice and laugh at material I missed previously because of laughing so hard and frequently. My first viewing was with a few ""friends"" I had actually found the video in a video store for rental and had no clue as to what I was about to watch. What a confusing and arguably hilarious surprise as the film screened. Hopefully the film  will resurface on Amazon so more people can love, hate and ponder the different reactions, passionate reactions, regarding this film.

again don't miss the film and a chance to be a part of this illustrious disfunction.

thank you for your time.",1343001600,2,1035,4.614130434782608
