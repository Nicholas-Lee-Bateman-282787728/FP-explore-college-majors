8355406,5,B00280W8UK,"This is about a still active volcano in Hawaii as HOT LAVA continues to burble out of Earth's crust burning ANYTHING it comes into contact with and then rolling off into the ocean where it looks like Forth of July Snakes as it tumbles down into the water where it is eventually cooled into stone.  Some excitingly surreal scenes. Additionally wildlife is examined. Insightful.

Extras include a Behind the Scenes and then an additional documentary about wildlife and waves that affect the island. Insightful.",1523664000,,508,5.035714285714286

8355408,5,B00280W8UK,This was a great DVD. It was interesting to watch.  I visited the Big Island because of this DVD.  I made sure I did the volcano cave because of this DVD.  The person that owns the cave gives private tours.,1435968000,,206,4.1

8355410,5,B00280W8UK,"If you have never travelled to Hawaii and seen a volcano eruption up close, this is an excellent DVD to view.  It gives you a good idea of being there yourself.
As an former Big Islander who has experienced seeing a number of volcanic eruptions and lava flows, I'd have no hesitation to recommend this item to anyone. Heck, I'd buy it again!",1405814400,2,341,4.412698412698413
8355411,5,B00280W8UK,"I ordered this as I do enjoy Nature and all it ups and turmoils.
I did bring it up for my Mother to see and she loved it.",1366502400,,121,3.357142857142857
8355412,4,B00280W8UK,"Speaking from experience (born and raised on Hawaii the Big Island), volcanic eruptions are not new to me.  This video, however is a collection of spectacular film footage of our on-going eruption.  This may be the only under-water film piece (to date) of lava as it enters the ocean.  Truly worth seeing.",1263772800,5,305,4.826923076923077
