3540401,5,B001DW2BIS,"The salvation of a dismal education system may be the Internet, the DVD and the interactive CD-ROM.  Thos set of DVDs on the first World War is a case in point.  As a teacher of history I know that if one is to inform a student, a certain amount of entertainment must go with the facts.  This set meets both criteria.

This may not be the ultimate, in-depth set of DVDs on the subject, but it is a superb start.  It should be viewed by students and then discussed.  The disks put this war in perspective with other events in Europe at the time of the war and in the decades leading up to it.  After all, the war did not come out of the blue one day in Sarajevo.

But this is also for the adult student with even a modest interest in history.",1224115200,37,741,4.062068965517241

3540403,5,B001DW2BIS,"Hello ,

This is very good documentary. It's a 3 disk set in 1 container , but very good.

Half way through disk 2 is where all the action starts , and it never stops.
It's unbelievable. I didn't know they had video cameras in World War 1.

Disk 1 gives you insight on all the European Countries , what they were
talking about , how they dressed and what led up to WAR.

The way they dressed was pretty way-out , but great to look at.

Put your seat belt on , because when the action starts , your going
to be in for a ride.

They film everything.

Bombs from cannons exploding in the trenches on top of men.

They had so many cannons out there , I though they had Nick
Cannon out there.

I never saw so many cannons in a war documentary.

Bodies all over the place.

John Wayne could not survive this one.

I didn't make it to disk 3 yet , I'm still on disk 2.

A lot of times I will rewind something to see it again.

World War 1 was off the chain.

Listen to me. Have patients through disk 1 to get all the insight
about the Countries associations with each other to have war ,
and those crazy outfits.

About 1/4 the way through disk 2 the action starts and never stop.

You will be completely entertained and educated.

Buy IT NOW!

Thank You ,

Satisfied Customer.",1448150400,,1270,4.044354838709677

3540427,1,B001DW2BIS,"With World War 1 centennial commemorations coming up for the next five years you will certainly be tempted to get a good documentary to make a little sense of the war for yourself. This is one you can stay away from.

What we have here, as others have pointed out is scrambled footage ripped from the crucial BBC doc The Great War, along with some other material. Then someone culled a narration from John Keegan's World War One book, (which is well worth reading) and then indifferently read portions as the images often randomly drift by. At the end of each poached episode it mentions using the services of a stock footage company. What they don't mention is that the archives of this service seems to have contained a full film print of The Great War. The American accented reader seems to be one of my dear countrymen who don't get out of the country much and who massacres a majority of European names mentioned. If this is the only documentary you can find you'd get something out it.

But it is not the only documentary on World War 1!

So take note.

First of all, and most importantly, The Great War is available through Amazon UK, which you can order from if you have a US account. This is the gold standard documentary on that war. (The Great War is to World War One docs what The World at War is to World War Two.) There are two versions. The one on""Simply Media"" is relatively cheap about $95. It is six discs and it has about 1036 minutes (17 hours plus) of footage. It's well worth the price. I have recently watched it on a Blu Ray player that is fussy about region 2. So although it says region 2 it is in fact playable in North America.

Next: The First World War - The Complete Series based on a book by Hew Strachan is an excellent recent series with much new material about 9 hours long. Also indispensable.

Also made to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary is The Complete Story: World War I a CBS production from the 60s. It is almost 12 hours long and gives a completely different take on the war. It covers lots of material not dealt with in the BBC production and is best at dealing with the post-war fighting in Poland and Russia.

And finally the most moving is the British 2008 90th Anniversary documentary called Last Voices of World War 1. This has interviews with the last British survivors of World War 1, who are all now dead. If you have an ounce of sensitivity this one will break your heart. But I recommend the UK version, which is an hour longer, if you have a region free player (and really you should have one).

Those are the best over all. Maybe someone will make a newer one.

Single discs worth a watch include:

Gallipoli - a Turkish co-production that came out a few years back

Hitler: The Unknown Soldier 1914-1918 - is quite informative.

The Guns of August - is an excellent introduction to the causes of the war based on Barbara Tuchman's book. A region 2 UK version is available.

Also if your machine is region free many other titles can be found at Amazon UK.

Any other suggestions for us?

3540428,5,B001DW2BIS,I haven't watched all the episodes but what I've seen is not only interesting but brings historical light to the reasons for both sides/.

3540445,1,B001DW2BIS,"The only reason to spend money on this is if you want a good laugh, or an example to show film students of what not to do.  It's so horrible we could not watch beyond the first episode.  The narrator sounds like the robot who calls you from the drug store to tell you your prescription is filled, and he mispronounces words so that their meaning is distorted.  So bad it's funny.  The sound is terrible---sounds like they recorded it with a toy mike.  The footage keeps repeating itself.  I honestly can't understand why anyone would put the work into producing a 7.5-hour documentary and think that this is acceptable.  High school students could do better.  There are much better documentaries out there, folks.  Run from this one.  It's a giant waste of your time.",1351987200,5,767,4.614814814814815
3540446,3,B001DW2BIS,"This is a good ten part documentary series about world war I.  However, it is not very fancy.  There are some few black and white interviews with veterans and a couple of ""quotes"" of historical characters given by voice actors.  However, most of the narration is a monotone narration given from script without even a presenter or talking head.  There are few frills and no fancy maps, 3d CGI, actor battle recreations or anything like that.

PRO: Very thorough ten part series, very competent and accurate from everything I saw (judging by my limited amateur historian knowledge of World War 1

CON: If you need eye candy, engaging storytelling, or like reenactment or computer graphics, there are none.  Because of this, the presentation is very dry and almost like a classroom experience.

I bought my copy for $5 at a local store called Bi-Mart.  At that price, this is worth it for the completest or serious student interested in the War to End All Wars.",1346025600,4,958,4.757575757575758
3540447,3,B001DW2BIS,"THE WAR TO END WAR 1914-1918 is a ten-part series of 40 minute episodes that seem geared to those already familiar with the battles of WWI. Some viewers may get lost in this program's rapid flow, for there's few maps to illustrate specified maneuvers or troop locations. The narrator's constant mispronounciation of place names isn't helpful, either.

The first episode covers pre-war Europe and the June 1914 assassinations in Sarajevo of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife (Sophie). Included is a photo of the couple lying in state.

B&W interview footage of aging veterans is featured. One man describes the drowning effect caused by poison gas, and the helplessness of watching the agonies of those exposed to ground-hugging yellow clouds. Their memories of horrid conditions endured during long years of trench warfare defy belief.

One of the better chapters, ""Flyboys"" offers incomplete and/or inaccurate data. We're told that all eight original American pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille were KIA,  including the son of an American president. Which president?

Teddy Roosevelt's youngest, Quentin was a pilot who died in battle in 1918, but he was a member of the 95th Aero Squadron, an American unit from Texas.

On the plus side, it's interesting to see massive multi-engined eight-man bombers the Germans came up with later in the war. Zeppelin warfare, including a glimpse inside one of the enormous airships, and another going up in flames, is also quite fascinating. Best of all, this episode doesn't make us sit through numerous sequences of marching infantry, like in so many of the others.

Among the many new weapons introduced between 1914 and '18 is the motion picture, used in aerial reconnaisance of troop positions. Cameramen were also on and behind the lines. Their surviving footage is an invaluable record of a new type of war that became obsolete almost as soon as the 11/11/18 armistice was signed.

Although not perfect, THE WAR TO END WAR makes a sincere effort to explain a complex struggle, one in which anywhere from 15 to 65 million perished.",1340668800,,2089,5.087719298245614
3540448,2,B001DW2BIS,"This appears to be a thrown together job. Lots of stock footage that repeats, repeats and repeats. Barely got through the first disc. Narration was good and did cover main points. Want to see how the US involvement is handled but so far not imnpressed.",1335139200,,252,4.622222222222222
3540449,3,B001DW2BIS,"the documentary is interesting for a couple reasons.  first, they rely entirely on old photographs and film footage for their visuals, instead of interspersing it with modern footage.  the problem is that there really isn't that much usable footage out there from the first world war, so they reuse the footage to a comical extent, showing the same scene of soldiers running across a field 10 or 15 times while referencing everyone from the french to the british to the germans.  it also features old interviews with veterans from the war, but neglects to show their names, so the viewer doesn't even know who they are.  i think this shows how much of a budget job this production was; the producers couldn't afford to film their own extra footage or pay for proper titles.

but the biggest flaw is how the narration, while detailed and comprehensive, is rarely delivered in context to the reused images on the screen.  frequently, the narrator descends to repetitive lists of army movements and battles, but without accurate visual maps to show the viewer exactly where all this is taking place, the details lose their importance.  there is almost too much information, and the narrator frequently goes into passages like, ""the third army attacked south of the town, while general smith attacked north and the second brigade moved to the west, while general johnson created a fourth corps and exposed the left flank while the other corps turned south and attacked the reserve in the north.""  too many different armies and too many names makes it very confusing at times exactly who is attacking who.  the few maps they do use seem to be lifted from other documentaries and don't always clearly display the same information the narrator is giving.

of course, this is only a problem because there is so much information being given.  the narration, while sometimes monotone and awkward sounding, is loaded with details about troop movements and military strategies.  some documentaries focus on average people caught up in the war, but this one focuses strongly on the military leaders involved and their logic in planning their battles.  some sequences go into detail about how certain battles were planned by the generals, and then how the plans went terribly wrong.  i found this aspect of the documentary fascinating, and much more interesting than other documentaries that tend to lean more toward the civilian side of things.  although it could have been much better if they had used more maps to show exactly where each army was moving.

in general i think this is a good documentary, with lots of great information and focus on the military side, but the cheap production and reused visuals kind of ruin its impact.",1330732800,4,2723,4.925601750547046

3540451,2,B001DW2BIS,The cost made it a bargain and I thought the video was not terrible but the narration was poor and the information was almost at water fall level....too much too quick.

3540463,1,B001DW2BIS,"As others have mentioned, many video sections are repeated several times.  It even looks like some may have come from movies, as you can see a shell explode about ten feet from a man who appears not to notice it.  The history of the time and the strategies of the combatants seem to be pretty well conveyed, in compressed form.  From that point of view, it is informative.  But what detracted so much, for me, was the narration.  So many words are idiotically mispronounced: quay, Kriegsmarine, and place names like Liege, Aachen, Verdun, not to mention the ubiquitous German preposition ""von"" and names like ""Wilhelm.""  I found myself laughing, and wondering if they set out to make the thing sound like a high school production!",1318377600,2,730,4.8
3540464,2,B001DW2BIS,"I hate to shred anyone's efforts because it's a ton of work to put together a doc like this but it's not a good product. The narration is so much like a radio announcer reading stats off the side of a cereal box that the information has no impact. He uses the same slightly oily tone for everything he's saying, whether it's a light moment or mass deaths, and emphasizes the oddest words out of a sentence as if he's trying to give it interest but doesn't know how. He mispronounces common names and words constantly, mostly in the German or French but also in English. It's annoying and very unprofessional.

The footage is used over and over as other reviewers have mentioned, and it's extremely noticeable. Rather than trying to find still images or more footage, they just loop things, sometimes in the wrong place. A very clear misuse is an introduction of Manfred Von Richthofen while showing a shot of Oswald Boelcke,whose name the guy slaughtered every time he said it.)
The coverage and script is patchy and strangely weighted: minute detail is slaved over but then the overview is skipped so you never feel as if you've learned anything. The supposedly ""personal"" accounts included are oddly chosen clips from letters read by actors. Things are timed strangely: for instance in chapter five, ""Flyboys"",Immelmann and Boelcke, lumped together, get twice the time as Manfred Von Richthofen. One other German ace is named and his death detailed but nobody else is mentioned at all. They still did better than the Americans: we're shown faces and told ""president's son"" and such, but they never tell you who you're looking at. Rickenbacker gets about two sentences, Luftbery got three, nobody else rated a mention. Bishop is shown and his name said once. Guynemer suffers a terrible pronunciation of his name and no other French (or any other country's pilots) are even nodded to. Then they go on to talk about airships for probably three times as long as they talked about planes, though airships didn't change the face of the war and the world the way planes did. Incidental detail trumps the sort of overall information that gives a documentary form and cohesion: for instance, for all the tiny details of Boelcke's every month in the Jasta, they then neglect to tell you how the governments didn't back flight, how Biship championed it and was blacklisted for it, etc etc. There isn't enough personal detail to make you understand a single man's position in the war, yet they totally blow it on giving you any sort of picture of the war itself (except in chapter one which is so, so slow and plodding that I nearly fell asleep waiting for them to make sense of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and how that started things off. They never did get around to making sense of it.) In other words, lots of talking, very little useful information.
 And the overall script between each segment also doesn't adhere--the flight section, chapter five, ends with the end of the war. Then chapter six starts and we're back in 1915. It is impossible to keep track of and makes no sense chronologically.
All the chapters are like this. The whole thing is presented so chopped and haphazardly put together that it's a total waste of time. Don't bother. You'll learn ten times more about WWI from a book and you may actually understand enough to learn something.",1315180800,3,3362,4.774914089347079

3540471,2,B001DW2BIS,"This review refers to the 2008 Mill Creek Entertainment 3-DVD set.

This set is nothing more than an inferior re-edited, re-dubbed and re-packaged version of the 2005 Madacy Entertainment.

The Madacy Entertainment version was titled Trenches: Battleground WWI and was released in a 5-disc set in a metal tin, complete with fold-out disc holder and a 25-page illustrated booklet and featured a narrator with a cultured voice not unlike Christopher Plummer.

A previous reviewer states that this is a re-edited version of yet another DVD series entitled THE GREAT WAR. I am not familiar with that one and cannot speak to whether it is the same as the Madacy version, but it is worth noting for the benefit of potential buyers.

THIS Mill Creek release trims off the opening and closing credits, chapter titles and narration, then inserts their own with an overmodulated narration that sounds like they stuck someone in a sound booth with a script in front of an open mike.

The script is juvenile and the narration is bland at best, but it states the facts and gives one at least a junior high understanding of the subject. The film footage used is still the same and of very good quality, but at the same time some of the opening and closing footage has been lost because of the editing, so you are losing some of the program, but nothing directly related to the educational portions.

I would recommend passing this ripoff in favor of the genuine artical.",1278374400,21,1456,4.780876494023905
3540472,5,B001DW2BIS,I was look for some more information on WWI when I chance across WWI The War to End All Wars The DVD came in a factory seal box. The first disk I loaded I was surprise and delighted The War to End All Wars  coved some information about pre WWI I didn't know about. The narrator has a good deep voice and has a steady narration all though the DVD. The way the subject matter would fall into someone who is either in high school or the first years of collage. All and all I came feeling a little richer about the history of wars to end all wars.,1271116800,,543,3.981651376146789
3540483,1,B001DW2BIS,"This is essentially a repackaging of the BBC series ""The Great War"" from the sixties.  Same footage, same interviews, same prissy dramatization of  David Lloyd George.  The difference is that this is a much less chomphrehensive look at the war, and a much less professional production.  The title cards are plagued by spelling errors, the music is a mishmash of classical tunes and the narration is inferior.

Find ""The Great War"" instead of getting this.  It's 27 hours of the best war documentary you'll ever see.",1262563200,8,515,4.930232558139535
3540484,4,B001DW2BIS,"bought this for only $5 at target.  Only on second disc, but 'enjoying' it so far.  Lots of footage, straighforward narration, can't complain for 5 bucks.  I'll just add one thing.  If you see this in the store and look at the back, the scenes are all colorized.  It does not say anywhere on the dvd that it's in color or colorized, but i was kinda hoping it was.  All b&w so far.  No false claims at all so i can't be upset, but the color stills on the back made me think it might be in color.  Oh well, still recommended if it's cheap.",1261008000,3,537,4.0476190476190474
3540485,3,B001DW2BIS,"I bought this DVD for my class studying WW1- it was done with authentic footage, but the language was way over their heads.  I wish I bought the other one done in color.  It was a good value and had lots of information, but a bit dry.",1257724800,,234,3.9574468085106385
3540486,1,B001DW2BIS,"The script is good. You could learn something if you manage to really follow the droning.

But, if you're a visual learner...well...you'll probably struggle. The amount and variety of footage is pretty good but they repeat much of it OVER AND OVER in all sorts of different, unrelated contexts..even simply mirror imaged to disguise that they just used it! All quotes of any army use British voices...no matter what the nationality.
The delivery of the script is very wooden; uninteresting. It's poorly organized.

Basically, it's painful to watch.

Visually, it becomes numbing as it's mostly just a never-ending splice of video footage played over the narration.  Now and then, the footage seems to have SOMETHING to do with the narration, but often not.

Very little and poor use of maps (mostly very old animations on the maps).  This makes explanations of battle maneuvers, strategies and tactics quite difficult to follow.  For a recent offering (2008), I was surprised at how much of a re-hash it was.  No original graphic work at all that I could see.

There was a galling lack of attention to detail.  Even the graphics in the title sequence say ""The War to End Wars"" instead of ""The War to End All Wars"".

Looks like a real ""budget"" job.",1256083200,26,1247,4.834905660377358
3540487,3,B001DW2BIS,"I have two major criticisms of this documentary.  First, the mispronunciation of the names and organizations is both irritating and hilarious.  I had never heard the ""Admiralty"" pronounced as it is in this presentation.  I would also add that the mispronunciation of both German and French names is a refreshingly evenhanded abuse of both languages!  Second, the presentation of the war is uneven.  The first disc starts with a very ambitious and detailed account of the war.  The authors then seem to realize that in order to cover the total war in similar detail would take about 10 discs.  Discs 2 and 3 then proceed to skimp on detail in order to cover the entire war.  Finally while this is not a major criticism, the repeated use of the same video footage is boring.",1248134400,8,772,4.708955223880597

3540489,1,B001DW2BIS,The text of this documentary is largely lifted from John Keegan's 1999 history of the war--and he's not given credit anywhere in the film.,1243296000,3,138,4.791666666666667
3540490,4,B001DW2BIS,"I have several DVD series on World War One. The Complete Story of World War I, narrated by Robert Ryan is an older series and dated in some ways, but is pretty good. The more recent ""The First World War,"" based on historian Hew Strachan's new work on the war, is also very good and covers some different material. This series, ""WWI: The War to End All Wars"" differs from the other two in some ways. That is, you can own all three and learn something different from each one. Having said that, this series could have been a lot better in many ways. The narration is so-so in that the narrator mispronounces a number of names and places. The series editor should have caught those mistakes. The music is inappropriate; sometimes it reminds me of Ken Burns' ""The War"" which inexplicably used very slow jazz and other inappropriate music when describing a battle or related events. This series does the same, and it can be distracting. The theme song of this series is a fast, happy, Dixieland tune - very inappropriate for the material covered. Another weakness in the documentary that could have been a signficant strength are the interviews with several WWI veterans and some recordings of actual high-level officials (or nearly contemporaneous readings from their speeches and writings). For some odd reason, these excellent interviewees were not identified in the documentary. Sometimes you could figure out who they were from the script, but you had to listen carefully. It would have been good for the series editor to put the names of the interviewee at the bottom of the screen. If they didn't know who was speaking, they probably could have figured it out from the script or from historians familar with these figures (one appeared in World At War also and was a staff officer in the First World War, and wrote up diaries and other narrative accounts of WWII, Sir Edward Spears). Why names were omitted from the DVD is hard to understand. Other aspects of the historical narrative that are better understood today should have been corrected, such as the myth, popularized by Barbara Tuchman, that the generals and their timetables started WWI. The documentary mentioned this, and given that it is a very new production, I would have expected this to be corrected (the origins of the war are more properly rendered in the Hew Strachan DVD, though also covered rather briefly there). Overall, this is a pretty good DVD production with a lot to recommend it. It is ashame that the editor was not much more careful with the narration and other aspects of the production. We are still waiting for the definitive 'World At War'/'Civil War' documentary for WWI - an enormously important event in modern history.",1243296000,94,2710,4.817596566523605
3540491,3,B001DW2BIS,"I picked up my copy from a jobber rack at a local supermarket. Given the price I wasn't expecting much but thought may would be worth a gamble compared to the Hollywood dreck in the neighboring bin.

The well considered script, along with the substantial period film footage and inclusion of interviews - culled from an older program - kept my interest and left me ready each following program.

The narration, is far from memorable, though seemingly competent in execution, save the pronunciation problems as pointed out in another review.

I do concur with  Mr. Graham in his review on the use of music in the soundtrack which will alter randomly between asynchronous an annoying. Even the music selection for the end credits seems flippant given the subject matter.

For general consumption though these problems can likely be overlooked. This was a good effort by the producers.",1242604800,33,882,4.9727891156462585
3540492,3,B001DW2BIS,"On the plus side,  this 3 DVD set has film footage and still photos that I have never seen before which adds much new visual information.  This is the strongpoint of this DVD.

On the negative side, the narration is sophomoric:  dull, monotone and lifeless; rather like an overlong  lecture from your worst history teacher.  Added to this is his atrocious mispronunciation of foreign words which is highly irritating.  You have to hear it to believe it but  typical examples are General Petain pronounced ""pitane"" and the city of Liege pronounced ""leej"".  His butchering of German names is comical.  Clearly he is reading from a script and pronounces foreign words phonetically.  Not very professional.

Added to the irritation is the use of classical music in the background of many of the scenes;  not only do the musical selections not fit the film or the narrative, they are distracting.

The story is told in more or less chronological order but there is a disconnect to the chronology which negatively affects the flow of the documentary.  Keeping to one theme rather that cutting it up into smaller parts would have been better.

The film footage makes this a 3 star DVD;  otherwise, it would not rate more than 1 star.",1236038400,7,1226,4.8173076923076925

Monotone, jarring, very odd enunciation, very amateurish. He sounds like a school teacher reciting from a book.

It's a shame because the content is very well done and the footage is compelling. But it's completely ruined by the narration.",1516406400,,411,5.134328358208955

8295072,5,B001DW2BIS,"This three part series is a well narrated (pronunciations are correct) and accurate way to view World War I for those with an interest in military history. It offers an overview with basic information and original film footage that gives a view into both the social changes and the nightmare of trench warfare.

This is not intended as an in-depth study of World War I. I did find the presentation format interesting with a narrator who could pronounce names of places and battles correctly.  Definitely recommended for those who are beginning to find their way into military history and for those of us that might be looking for original film footage.

Why 'five stars?' Correct pronunciation, reasonably accurate and original film footage!
