8482820,5,B005Q12ZRO,"The world of indie film-making is making major advances, and one of those is the ability of filmmakers to go outside of the Hollywood distribution system. Nowhere is this more important, than in an industry which says ""Black films don't sell"".  This edition of CODE BLACK is the one Hollywood wouldn't sign up for. Any unknown filmmaker who does not have the name Coppola of Tarantino can forget running times over two hours. In this edition, we surpass that limit and add important scenes and nuances integral to telling the whole story. The greatest criticism I ever received from this film was an IMDB poster who said ""I was really enjoying this movie until I realize there was a message behind it!""

That about says it all.",1317427200,,727,4.716535433070866
