8686061,2,B00P17VP06,"Bob Ross is quiet, calm, and very upbeat. In fact, I'm convinced that is why people enjoy watching him teach painting. Watching this is very similar to having one of those white-noise CDs on in the background that plays the sounds of the ocean with the gulls, or the rain falling in a forest. It has all the inherent stimulation of being an auditory sleeping pill, these DVDs just kick it up a notch to also being a visual sleeping pill.
Everything he teaches on the 10 DVD set could have been taught and demonstrated on a single DVD. This is a fun technique for representing a very limited number of ""things"". Mountains, pine trees, water.  I do not doubt that Bob Ross knew how to paint, but this is geared towards keeping the institutionalized patients un-aggitated and not for getting your creative juices flowing.",1450483200,8,818,4.641379310344828
