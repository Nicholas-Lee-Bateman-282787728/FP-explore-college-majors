7881635,2,6305070695,"I wanted a Yoga Tape for beginners (gentle poses, easy instruction) so I chose this series, for ""older adults"" even though I am in my 30s (a friend of mine is in her 50s and helped to try the morning ""workout"").
The first 20 minutes of the tape, you are sitting in a CHAIR doing things like stretching your jaw muscles and your TOES (not exactly the 'problem areas' on my body).  I fast forwarded through most of this. It seemed to go on forever.  When she finally got up and started doing ""poses"", she'd only do a simple pose once and then say, ""Okay, let's rest."" HUH?  (Crossing one foot over the other ONE time does WHAT, exactly?)  Funny thing is, after doing all of this almost-no-movement stuff, she suggests you lay on your stomach and arch your back upward.  Anyone who is so out of shape or feeble that they need to do warm up exercises sitting DOWN is not going to be able to lay down and bend backwards!
Quite honestly? (and my friend said the same thing):  Except for the back bend poses, these tapes would be good for the elderly or someone with limited mobility.  If you're looking to get the kind of body that celebrities are getting with yoga, this is NOT the tape for you!",1042934400,3,1190,4.333333333333333
7881636,5,6305070695,"I am 57 and wanted to start practicing yoga but was concerned about various injuries and age-related limitations. This video is just about perfect if you are just beginning and want basic instructions that emphasize safety, but you also want to get started and learn some poses. Also good warm-up before and relaxation after the poses. I appreciate the calm and relaxed way Lilias presents each pose and find her tips very helpful. The routines are easy to follow and not so complicated or strenuous that beginners will get discouraged. You can't go wrong with this set as a good, safe starting point at any age.",1036022400,6,612,4.783018867924528
