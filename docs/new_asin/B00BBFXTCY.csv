And the bonus yoga...well she does't explain when she is changing positions or how many times you are going to do a pose, so you get lost. There's no way to look at the TV while you are in some poses.",1479772800,,354,3.863013698630137

Because I'm a beginner, I cannot judge the correctness of her techniques, but can say that they look like what I'm being taught in class.
Sherena's voice is good and not irritating and the music is nice.
She goes through barre and then centre and has an additional yoga section which I haven't done yet but it looks like a good stretch routine.
Overall I'd recommend this to anyone who whats to practice at home and not have to think of their own choreography. Of course you could probably modify the techniques if they aren't in the style you are doing (eg Vaganova's or Cecchetti method).
If you are experienced then you can do the DVD from beginning to end without all the instructions (which I am finding very helpful).",1394150400,5,849,4.592105263157895
