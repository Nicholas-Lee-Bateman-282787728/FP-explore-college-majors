8305190,5,B001GEDV6O,An outstanding book which challenges Christians to put God first in their financial decisions.,1445040000,,94,5.785714285714286
8305191,1,B001GEDV6O,"This video series is awful. The book is helpful, but there is nothing good to be said about the DVD. Randy Alcorn is only in about 4 minutes per 25-min episode, and the rest is presented by a toothy guy with a car salesman-esque persona. Peppered into each episode are cheesy reenactments of biblical parables and historical events, as well as interviews with ""real-life givers"" that are hard to watch. Even if you liked the book, skip this series. Zero stars.",1444867200,,460,4.691358024691358

8305193,2,B001GEDV6O,We bought the book and the video.  Just get the video and don't devote a ton of time to it as it is very repetitive.  We made the mistake of planning a full multi-week study of the book but lost interest after week 2.  It's just too simplistic in its message and approach.,1378771200,,272,4.09433962264151
8305194,4,B001GEDV6O,Done as a study group. Teached us to better understand our role as God's Money Manager in an easy to follow biblical way. No one felt awkward discussing God's money. Eye opening to some and encouraging to others. Everyone took something positive from it- one step further in our growth.,1303776000,2,286,4.74
8305195,5,B001GEDV6O,This is one of the best books on a Biblical attitude of giving that I have ever encountered. I encourage every to get a copy and read it.,1270512000,,137,3.9285714285714284
8305196,5,B001GEDV6O,Our family just finished watching this set of 2 DVDs. The teaching in them has helped us to rethink how we manage the resources God has entrusted us with. They are His resources not ours that He has entrusted us with. We are to be good stewards of what He has given us and not owners. We highly recommend these DVDs to any one interested in doing God's will. This is not name it and claim it theology but Biblical Truth.,1265500800,4,420,4.197530864197531
