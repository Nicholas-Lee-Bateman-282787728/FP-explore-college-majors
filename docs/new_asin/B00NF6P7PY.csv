6648013,3,B00NF6P7PY,A good insight but it could be a little broader in coverage,1435276800,,59,4.0
8677688,5,B00NF6P7PY,This is a good documentary about trains you can enjoy in Switzerland. I myself have taken some of these trains and the way they are covered in this spectacular. I think the only thing missing in this documentary is the ticket prices for each train but other then that small detail it's a must watch documentary,1532390400,,310,4.553571428571429

8677691,3,B00NF6P7PY,"Decent content with descriptive narrative and above-average cinematography.  Stylistically though, there are too many scene cuts, annoying shifts to slow or fast motion, and incongruous music selections.",1524787200,,203,6.518518518518518

8677693,3,B00NF6P7PY,"Especially about E2/3/4: if you want to show ""me: sightseeing, pls DONT show:
1. the inside of the train
2. ppl inside the train
3. the outside of the train
3. don't fast forward when nature is shown, but when the train goes in/out a station.
4. turn OFF the outside audio. don't care to hear the train. its easy to just play some elevator music in the background.",1515283200,,364,4.2898550724637685

Shows enough scenery, and also inside the trains.  There is a huge amount of somewhat unedited material in the Bonus section.",1502496000,,316,5.1568627450980395
