8040994,1,B0006AZ4OQ,I purchased the DVD thinking it was based upon Jack Finney's excellent tale by the same name. Was I ever disappointed!,1221523200,7,118,4.666666666666667
8040995,3,B0006AZ4OQ,"As a stand alone movie, I don't see why this won any awards - it's not even registered on [...] if it has indeed won awards. The critics must have also been from the director's home town like everything and everyone else. The main actor really stinks. So does the lead's mother. Thier performance really bring down the efforts of everyone else involved. Coupled with this movie is Jason's Tomaric's short film which is quite clever and the acting and directing is top notch. However time and again clearly written back in the 70s after the writer had probably watched a rerun of the short film that eventually aired on the twilight zone called ""Incident at Owl Creek."" Time and again's concept is taken straight from that movie. More so than was Jacob's Ladder which took it in an entirely new and fascinating direction. Not the case in time and again. Some poor perfomances, bad casting, a little weak direction here and there for the lead and mother. In one climatic scene the mother *SPOILER ALERT* hits the waitress over the head with a bat. It was so feeble she wouldn't even have killed a mouse never mind a human been. The editing tried to cover her crappy performance and weak direction by quickly putting some flash cuts in. Editing probably fixed a good deal of this flick too. Otherwise a great film and guide for anyone wanting to learn how to make a feature film on a low budget. Hopefully better than this. I was expecting to see a cool no budget movie like EL MARIACHI. But this movie really stinks.",1169424000,6,1514,4.569852941176471
