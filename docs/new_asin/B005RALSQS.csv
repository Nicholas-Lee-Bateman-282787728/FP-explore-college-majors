8484211,5,B005RALSQS,"This production was recorded at Teatro la Fenice in Venezia in April 2008.
The sets and costumes are based on a production of two centuries ago, and the very skilled singers were encouraged to ornament the vocal lines, as would have been expected at the time. This re-creation is as close as possible to what Rossini would have seen. The booklet doesn't speak to this but my ears suggest that they may be using gut the strings in the string section and guitars and some of the woodwinds sound softer as well. The large side drum used gives a mellow sound.
The stereo sound is focused just behind the orchestra; the 5.1 gives a good sense of the stage area. The voices are picked up well but not highlighted. It's a nice change to hear more of the ambience, and this renders the voices more accurately.

I was happy to see a particular favorite, Francesco Meli as Almaviva. His voice, while clear, open and large, is both resonant and flexible, with an open top. He is in also several of the Tutto Verdi series, shown to good advantage.
The other singers are excellent as well. To give an idea of their vocal feel, Roberto Frontali as Figaro is very much in the style and voice of Tito Gobbi, and Rinat Shaham's voice and phrasing is after Conchita Supervia with less vibrato. These are the types of voices less often seen these days - the most famous early Rosina was Maria Malibran, also a mezzo.
Giovanna Donadina is likely the best Berta I have seen, full-voiced and fully in character. All of the players include appropriate amounts of stage business and the energy is kept light. Since they all have voice to burn, they can glide through the coloratura and not have to negotiate the line, making the coloratura sound natural rather than artifice.
You'll also notice slightly different turns of phrasing in the orchestra that fit perfectly.
The proscenium is reduced in size with drapes, giving the feeling of a more intimate court theater. The stage dressings and costumes are of the period, no post-modern, neoclassical elements.
I'm not prepared to give up video productions with Florez, Spagnoli, DiDonato, Prey, Horne, etc but this DVD certainly joins them on the top shelf, and not only for Meli's large and open voice. This has an excellent ensemble with life and charm not often found. This far exceeded my expectations.
It is certainly worth exploration, and makes a good foil to either of the Florez outings.
I will complete writing the review of L'Equivoco Stravagante shortly.",1419552000,,2492,4.741935483870968
