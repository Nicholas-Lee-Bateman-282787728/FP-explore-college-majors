830992,5,6304266413,"Fighting Black Kings was the first video I've seen on full contact traditional karate.  The film follows the training regimen of fighters from all over the world as they prepare for the prestigious all-world full contact karate tournament in Japan.  The film cuts nicely from when the fighters are are on the fighting mat in the tournament to showing them back home training in their respective contries.  Although the tournament is open to all styles, the rules favor the kyokushinkai system.
The only reason the film is called ""Fighting Black Kings"" is because it focused on a number of prominent black karateka from New York such as Willie Williams and William Oliver who were preparing to compete in the All-World.  They trained in the Kyokushinkai system which is known for it's emphasis on full-contact kumite with no pads or gloves.  The fighters are interviewed and offer their perspectives on fighting in the All-World Tournament.",1058745600,15,939,5.071428571428571
830993,5,6304266413,"This documentry features Mas Oyama's Kyokushin Karate that would spawn other great Karate systems like Enshin and Seidokan.  There are also many great martial artists features like Sato and Joko Ninomiya (founder of Enshin and Sabaki).  The documentry follows many fighters from America, Japan, England, Thailand, and Hong Kong as they enter the first world karate tournement.

The matches are good, but what is especially interetsing is following the training that these individuals go through to enter this tournement.  This is fighting karate and anyone interested in rugged sparring and work-outs should view this film.

Additional Note: 02/23/2008:  Several years later and I still love this film.  I watch it three-four times a year.  One of the best martial arts docs out there. A DVD version with special features would be terrific, I hope it happens soon.",1006128000,8,864,5.255474452554744

I for one  always look back to this video for inspiration as I'am now a Kyokushin  Karateka and Karateka for the past 19 years in Wado Kai Karate as a 3rd  dan. Its too bad alot forgot about what Karate was all about and its nice  to see this video still around to show others how it should be. This video  also has a funky soundtrack as it was made in 1976. a Real Feel Good Video.",967939200,4,739,4.266187050359712

7866949,3,6304266413,"This is a documentary about the first international Kyokushin karate tournament, held in 1975 -- forty years ago as I write this.

The training was ""old school"", which is a casual way of saying that none of these dojos would be able to secure liability insurance today.  The video shows scenes from a black belt test that leaves you deeply impressed with the courage and toughness of the participants.  Schools in which the participants strike each other full on with no protective gear are uncommon to say the least.

As a documentary, the film is a bit lacking.  You learn very little about the Kyokushin style or the philosophy behind it, and the only explanation of the tournament rules is spoken in Japanese.  There's a lot of pointless filler material, like a badly staged request for an autograph.  Many of the training scenes feature shirtless men doing slow forms while tightly flexed (see the VHS cover image?), rather than showing how they drill for competition.  There's a random ""let's go back to Thailand for 60 seconds"" partway through that makes little sense.

On balance, the good parts outweigh the bad if you're interested in martial arts.  They did capture some interesting training, and they show a reasonable amount of the tournament.  The film doesn't shy away from showing the consequences of the risks the fighters are taking -- blood loss and broken bones.  These fighters are very tough, mentally and physically, and it comes through in the movie.",1421971200,2,1474,4.899193548387097

7866954,4,6304266413,"Out of curiosity, I investigated this 1976 documentary chronicling the first international karate tournament, not sure what I'd find. As it turns out, this - one of the very first martial arts-oriented documentaries, I'm sure - is a thoroughly viewable movie, slightly dated by its thirty-year-old production but featuring agelessly compelling content. Martial artists in general and karate students in particular ought to take a look at this piece of history, which features hand-to-hand action as entertaining as many a beat-em-up flick.

The movie documents the 1975 Tokyo All-World Karate Tournament - the first international kyokushinkai tournament wherein delegates from all over the world competed to crown the first world champion. The film covers the training of several American and Japanese competitors, as well as glancing at the methods of worldly entrants.

One of the few qualms I have about the picture is its title: originally called ""The Strongest Karate"" (as a matter of fact, the version I watched still bore this name in the opening credits), distributors instead settled for the title of ""Fighting Black Kings,"" which sounds provocative and reflects the fact that there are indeed prominent African-American karateka in this film, but the documentary encompasses martial artists from all over the world and focuses on the Japanese practitioners at least 50% of the time.

I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to prominent karate personalities, but martial arts historians and fans from way back will probably recognize a couple of the masters and competitors, among them 9th dan grandmaster Mas Oyama. The only individuals film fans might recognize are American competitors Charles Martin (who was in a handful of episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gentle-Ben/dp/B002CIA59O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gentle Ben</a>) and Willie Williams (from a bunch of cheap war films, most prominently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Missing-in-Action/dp/079284582X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Missing in Action</a>).

Despite being a documentary, I have to stress the thoroughly dramatic quality of the tournament it covers, which thankfully is the main focus of the film - occupying at last two-thirds of its runtime. We need to remember that these fights are not staged and any cool moves are pure spurt-of-the-moment decisions on the parts of the competitors, but there is no denying that it's a cumulatively exciting experience. The buildup to the final is tense and engaging, and along the way you get to know a few of the fighters enough to root for a few. It literally starts to feel like a real-life&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>: you've got good guys (any of the main participants you choose to follow) and bad guys (the ones so good they manage to push their opponents around at will while spectators laugh) and different fighting styles are represented (the rules favor karate, but kung fu and muay thai practitioners compete as well). Rest assured, it's a great show, even though it doesn't have the Hollywood-style ending.

The minimalist production suits the tone of the picture, and as far as I can tell, all information given by the narrator is accurate. The only real problem here (and it's more of a nitpick) is that said narrator doesn't supply enough specific information about karate: facing an audience that didn't might not have entirely known what a martial art is at the time, the documentary chooses to identify karate in broad terms, revealing little of its history and little of its distinctness, making it hard to distinguish between it and other described styles.

Nevertheless, things all come together for a roundly satisfying venture into the early times of contemporary martial arts. Again, martial artists and martial arts aficionados would probably have a good time with this one, provided it's available at a decent price. Give it a watch.",1350000000,5,4099,5.722495894909688
7866955,4,6304266413,"For a used VHS tape from 1972 the play back is amazing. I have only seen bootleg copies of this in the past.  If you are looking for DVD quality, you will not find it here, but for a very old VHS tape it is Great.  The documetary is very intresting, there was not as much known about Karate in 1972 as now.  Looking back at the interviews, the people, the clothing and hair styles is a trip to the past.  I highly recomend this video to any Martial Arts student.  It is most intresting to see from where many current styles got thier requirements for promotion and training.",1335830400,,574,4.229357798165138
