8309773,5,B001HUWQHM,"Owned ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" & traded it in...duh.  Rosanna is a gorgeous/talented gift to us all.  The young Madonna is truly sexy & cute as a button.  Wish Aidan could have stayed young & beautiful... ""Susan's"" clothes - Fabulous.  Roberta trading her self-involved/buttoned-up/boring as hell husband for Dez - a given.  Never heard of ""Mystery Date"", but there was no ""DSS"" offered w/out it.",1409961600,,399,5.171875
