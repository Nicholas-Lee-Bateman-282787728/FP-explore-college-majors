Nevertheless, i have already learned more from these videos about Organic Chemistry than i learned in two semesters in college from the blow-hard, Organic Chemistry PhD who taught me the first time. (Actually, i taught myself, and he mostly just clicked through powerpoint slides...)

MCAT doesn't seem like a cake walk no matter what you study, but this is definitely the most useful study tool i've seen so far...

Update: I took the MCAT and got a 30R. I would say that the study tool that helped me the most was this:

AND the AMCAS practice tests.

Have fun, fellow babies! Hopefully, i'll see you in medical school...",1266710400,6,686,4.691666666666666
8349986,5,B0023SV4X4,I used this to study for the MCAT with excellent results.  A great study tool for the MCAT or even just for ochem class.,1167091200,2,120,4.0

8349988,5,B0023SV4X4,I hate organic but this review kept me from getting bored.  I also liked that the prof explained how the different mechanisms worked so that I did not have to memorize so much.  Very helpful.  I feel alot more confident and now the mcat is in one month!,1089763200,17,253,4.229166666666667
