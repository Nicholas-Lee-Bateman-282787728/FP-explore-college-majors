2823723,3,B000PIIKMM,"Bound by Honor (1993), appears to have been inspired from a book,
that the director has faithfully transposed onto the silver
screen.

It's a valuable DVD rental for those interested in the urban
culture of the USA (particularly, in Los Angeles and Latinos back
in the 1970's.)

Considering the length of the film (3 hours), the visual quality
(although not wide-screen) takes on special significance, and
this is the  case here, showing outstanding talent in the
selection of various scenes in and around LA, in homes, barrios,
streets, and more, such that, the story is flawless in
representing all places where the actual story develops and
forms, upto and including showing a pentitentiary in its many
aspects. The importance of realism cannot be over-emphasized in a
movie dealing with this type of subject.

At the same time, the work is also another milestone in
documenting gang lifestyles, namely,  its origins and the
mentalities of those belonging and taking part in it.

The acting talent is also spotless, in particular  Benjamin Bratt
(as  Paco, a US Marine and later DEA agent), and Jesse Borrego
(as Cruz, a graffiti artist, and  painter). To a lesser degree,
Damian Chapa  (as Miklo, a gangster) puts in a good effort, while
also being a bit of an oddball in the casting. His perception is
shown, as battling being of mixed-origins, only half-Latino
having to be twice as extreme to be accepted by his peers in the
gang subculture.

The movie is educational, showing the uphill struggle of those
desiring to leave the penal system, once brought into it,
considering that the outside world (as well as the inside one) is
not black and white, but different shades of grey, as many
partake in gambling, the bookie business, sex rackets, gang
violence, abuse, physical threats, etc.

The script seems well articulated, with a fair bit of slang and
jargon from the subculture (""Don't mad dog me!"" or ""Carnal!"" -
bro, etc.)

The name of the movie, is perhaps a misnomer, as the gang members
are compelled to stand in solidarity with each other, over a
period of years, from a feeling of identity and common origins,
and not necessarily for satisfying a requirement of honor.
Indeed, the essence of this movie is about how people change, to
survive economically, realistically, and socially over a period
of years from youth to well into their adulthood, measuring that
change against a non-changing gang oath.

Particular effort was made into making the scenes stylish and
visually appealing: a Fedora hat, coupled with a white interior
shirt, or a muscle shirt being the gang uniform.

The movie has plenty of action, with street chases, wreckless
driving in streets spectacularly laid out, as well as man-to-man
combats, pistol firefights, and more.

The hardships behind bars are not left out, showing the pressures
felt, gang authority exerted , the outcome of limitated access to
help, freedom and resources in realizing one's natural potential,
or even, access to certain foods and dishes. It also suggests
payoffs occur behind the scenes which can explain a lot.

With merit, the story reminds viewers that, if there are sellers
of substances, it exists stems from a significant consumer-side
in the USA, meaning, a supply is setup, very profitably, to meet
the demand, with the resulting competition, double-crosses,
strategic take-outs of rivals, etc.

In sum, this is a long, visual movie, that will captivate the
audience, holds their interest and takes them on an impeccable
autobiographical tale from childhood in the barrio to adulthood,
with a number of hardships, struggles and successes.",1243036800,,3615,5.047058823529412
