8229624,4,B000XSWVE2,"If you like scary, this is your film.  I watched it once and that was scary enough for me.  It all starts out nice, then gets into the weird scary stuff, building to a tense ending.",1235260800,3,181,4.0
8229625,1,B000XSWVE2,"Laura Harring is Stacey, who lives in Africa with her husband Mark (played by John Hannah).

She looses him in an accident then finds she is pregnant.

When she has the baby there is a blurred line whether the baby boy is possessed by her dead husband or not.

And here's where it gets disturbing.

*Spoliers*

She breast feeds the baby who sucks so hard it draws blood. But the doctor's can't find teeth when they examine the baby.

She holds it in the shower and the baby plays with her nipple and she has visions of making love under the shower with her dead husband and then notices her baby son is overly excited.

That's the info, it's up to you if you want to see that sort of thing",1204588800,9,689,4.213740458015267
