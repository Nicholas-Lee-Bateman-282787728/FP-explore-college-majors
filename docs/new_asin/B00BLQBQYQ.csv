5646354,4,B00BLQBQYQ,"Another of Vinegar Syndome's awesome ' Drive-In double features' - this duo disk offers a pair of 70's sexploitation flix wth markedly opposed 'vibes'.  The common denominator might appear to be the starring presence of the lovely Barbara Mills in both films - she has that 'tuff chick' 70's look with low slung bell bottom jeans, long straight brown hair, and a smokin' hot athletic style body she is not afraid to share with the audiance!

""The Suckers"" represents the 'roughie' of the pair.  It is a blatant 'homage' to the classic 'Most Dangerous Game' theme of a rich, jaded, big game hunter turning his sights on human prey - first presented by 'King Kong' creator Merian C. Cooper waaay back in the 1930's.  Updated to 'present day' the story line follows a group of (VERY attractive)  fashion models & film crew who have been hired by a wealthy (you guessed it!)  big game hunter to do a photo shoot at his desolate & remote property in the desert... but (to their horror!!) they become the prey in his demented hunting ritual.  Vinegar Syndrome is generally noted for the xlnt visual quality of their product and this film is remarkably clear for its' age & obscurity - but - the original quality of THIS film is decidedly funky!  However, in this case, the archival imperfections actually work to the advantage of the viewing experience as this flik is quintessential 'grindhouse' fare - replete with: dancing scratches, massive color shifts within a scene, audio that is 'variable', at best, inexplicable scene cuts, and a few areas of degraded film stock that (if it wasn't a DVD) would lead you to think the movie was about to 'dissolve' in the projector.  In this way, the quality of the print really adds to the authentic grindhouse viewing experience.  The movie itself is sorta 'all over the map' in terms of its' plot and editing.  The early part of the story features a lot of pretty explicit sex scenes between the various characters involved - one would assume - to build a sympathetic rapport with them prior to 'the hunt'.  There is a goodly amount of full female/male nudity in the sex scenes but things stop (just) short of true hard-core XXX.  Ultimately, of course, the sexual frolics must end so that the hunter can get on with his business and the latter portion of the film focuses on the sadistic safari and includes many brutal scenes of sexual violence as the plot slogs forward to its' inevitable conclusion.  Over-all a 'wonderfully flawed' piece of 70's sinema!

In the, somewhat, diametrically opposed plot-line of ""The Love Garden""  the film's 'sensitive' male protagonist (looking like a Gabe Kaplan wannabe from 'Welcome Back Kotter')  goes ga-ga over the lovely ""Claire"" who moves into his apartment complex.  Unfortunately for him the object of his lustful obsession is already involved in a lesbian relationship with her possessive dyke GF played by Barbara Mills.  Maintaining that hopeful male premise: that all lesbians are really hetero. but just haven't found a 'good man' yet - our, liberated new-age, hero staunchly sets about 'tricking' Claire into accepting HIM as her significant sexual other by being as sickeningly 'nice' as possible - which 'almost' works.  The high-light of this flik (por moi) was the 'discovery' of the 'too sweet for words'  actress Linda York (as Claire) - star of quite a list of 70's exploitative pot-boilers - but this was the first time that I've laid eyes on her fetching face and figure!  Thanks to the 'bi-sexual' nature of the plot ""The Love Garden"" provides a cornucopia of both girl/girl and girl/guy sex.  There is ample full female nakedness from both Ms Mills & York, and their sapphic scenes present some very intimate camera angles and some genuinely sexy lesbo action.  This film is, amazingly / refreshingly, well written, filmed, and acted - even the Art Nouveau inspired artwork for the 'poster' is classy!  A surprisingly enjoyable viewing experience - I found myself zipping over to the IMDb site to check out more of Linda York's filmography  The film transfer quality (for both flix) is excellent wide-screen format.  No extras on the disk.",1379548800,5,4141,4.87018544935806
5646355,5,B00BLQBQYQ,"The love garden is one of the best movies I have seen this year from amazon. It seems like a real story from real life, and the crew, the director, the writer were very generous with their work. The story was great, the acting was not acting, it was 100% real including the sex parts between the two women, and between the guy, and the lesbian girl, it was real clear intercourse considering it was short but very effective. I suggest to every one who likes this type of the old sexploitation movies to have a copy. You will never go wrong, trust me it is a great movie and worth the money and more.",1371168000,4,599,4.217391304347826
5646356,3,B00BLQBQYQ,"It's very rare that you see a sexploitation film with a plot and decent acting these days.  This reflects the times which is late 70's.  It looks as if some scenes may have been edited out, but over all the movies are good.",1370217600,,223,4.162790697674419
5646357,5,B00BLQBQYQ,"I applaud Vinegar Syndrome for releasing films that no one else would touch and I also appreciate that most of them are 70's explotation and sexploitation films. It's like I'm reliving my teenage years all over again. They take the utmost care in the films' restorations and always show the films in their actual theatrical ratio. They may be the new kid on the block, but they are a welcome addition to old fogies like me!",1367107200,25,423,4.578947368421052
5646358,2,B00BLQBQYQ,"The Suckers was ok it's actually a story that has been done many times over. My main problem is I could not get the second movie Love Garden to play and it was the main one I wanted. Are other people having this problem or is my just disc defective , The Suckers played no problem but not Love Garden.",1366329600,,301,4.033333333333333
5646359,5,B00BLQBQYQ,My favorite genre queen of exploitation is the smoking hot Barbara Mills. Her sex scenes look like she's having some real steaminess with her enjoyment. First off I have the SWV dvd-r of Love Garden and this transfer blows it away. I had never seen The Suckers before and I absolutely loved it. The acting in both films is quite good. There is a lengthy believable rape scene in The Suckers that may offend some so be aware of that if that decides your purchase. Overall this is a high reccommend for fans of trash cinema. I will continue to support this company as they seem to be releasing films that Something Weird Video/Image Entertainment could never release.,1365897600,39,665,4.6440677966101696
5646360,3,B00BLQBQYQ,"Almost 40 years ago, I took my date to a drive-in to see some forgettable artsy foreign costume period piece whose title escapes me. When ""The Suckers"" appeared on the screen, I assumed it was a preview, but it in fact went on for an entire reel. Wrong movie or not, it was actually kind of interesting, so I was disappointed when it was followed by the second reel of the costume drama. My date and I, seemingly the only people in the place to notice the incongruity, suffered through the rest of the scheduled flick.

So ever since, I've hoped ""The Suckers"" would appear on VHS or DVD so I could find out what happened. I found a trailer for it from Something Weird Video, but imdb.com didn't list the movie, and several inside sources stated confidently that it had been forever lost.

From seeing the trailer, I am quite sure that my date would have been horrified had ""The Suckers"" continued past the first reel. It is a fine example of what was called, in those days before hard-core porn, a ""roughie."" Such pictures had no outright sex, but their plots did supply plenty of excuses to tie up girls and/or get them naked to kidnap them or punish them or make them talk. Believe it or not, most of the old ""roughies"" (""Love Camp 7,"" ""The Pick-Up,"" ""The House Near the Prado"") could not be made today, when graphic sex and graphic violence are OK, but sexual violence is taboo.

So if it sounds like your kind of movie, the evidence from the trailer is that it will deliver. Regardless, men will enjoy seeing one of the most appealing and attractive women of early 1970s sexploitation cinema: the lovely Laurie Rose (""The Abductors,"" ""The Hot Box""). Also on display are sexploitation queens Sandy Dempsey and Barbara Mills, who, like Laurie Rose, showcase glorious ""real girl"" natural beauty.

Note: ""The Suckers"" is a (loose) remake of Richard Connell's famous story ""The Most Dangerous Game."" ""The Woman Hunt,"" which was made the next year and also stars Laurie Rose, is a remake of the same story.

Update April 13, 2013: Picture quality is variable but overall quite acceptable. A few vertical lines here and there, and two places where both audio and video suddenly deteriorate, but briefly. Color is a bit washed out but much better than would be expected from a film that sat around for 40 years. Clarity is good.

""The Love Garden"" is a slow-moving, insipid excuse to get a little nudity on the screen. The color is weak; the story is weaker. Camera work is amateurish. It is purely a curious relic of a bygone era.",1363219200,28,2527,4.592017738359202

8570556,1,B00BLQBQYQ,"These Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but non-stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,,530,4.760869565217392

8570558,4,B00BLQBQYQ,Both of these movies played just fine for me.  The Suckers does have a fair amount of lines in the picture.  The Love Garden has a better picture.  Both of these movies have long sex scenes with both male and female frontal nudity.  The Suckers has the best story as a hunter wants to hunt people.  The Love Garden has a man trying to win over a lesbian who has a girlfriend.  Not as interesting as it sounds.  A good buy if you like Laurie Rose as she does a lot of nudity.,1398556800,2,474,4.032258064516129
8570559,1,B00BLQBQYQ,"Do not believe the five stars reviews! The Love Garden is one of the worst exploitation films i have ever seen. It's boring trash with no entertainment value at all. The picture quality is terrible on both films. Be aware. There is absolutely no remastering, no restoration, here. The picture is full of vertical green lines. Totally amaturish job by Vinegar Syndrome.",1398124800,,368,4.951612903225806
