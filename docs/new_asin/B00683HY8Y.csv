8494563,5,B00683HY8Y,I was satisfied completely. The unicorn series has had a profound impact on me as an anime enthusiast. The quality of picture and storyline make it an exciting journey to take part in on bluray. The order came in a timely manner and that means alot since I'm deployed overseas. Greatbuy!,1366156800,,287,4.647058823529412
8494564,5,B00683HY8Y,An absolutely wonderful blu ray and if you are worried about purchasing from any of the other sellers don't be. I purchased it from the Japan shop or whatever and it got here 4 days later (California to Wisconsin) I'm satisfied,1344470400,3,227,4.560975609756097
8494565,4,B00683HY8Y,"well, I have purchased every volume on blu-ray-this one from bandai-ent just before they closed permanently...on my birthday!  what a gift!  hopefully we will get to see the end of gundam uc at least on bd.  anyhow, this episode shows what the conflict on earth is like, it shows many different angles of the struggle along with some character history.  the battles are awesome but the gundam aspect of this episode is lacking, it's more about everyone else.  which is great but in the end we watch gundam for gundam. it also introduces new characters with almost no history and wipes them out before you get to know them-but it's still a great episode and well worth the money.",1331856000,,678,4.663865546218488
