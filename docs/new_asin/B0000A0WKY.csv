7995309,2,B0000A0WKY,"I first noticed Dean Cochran for his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Dangerous-Place/dp/B00009V7SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Dangerous Place</a>, and after seeing that he can perform a pretty good fight scene, I thought itd be cool to see him headline a movie. I need to learn to specify my wishes, because even though Air Marshal does indeed turn Dean into a leading man, the vehicle itself is pretty darn dreadful. With poor action scenes and a seriously flawed screenplay, this is definitely one of the worst offerings from the Nu Image / Millennium catalogue.

The story: When a trans-European flight is hijacked by extremists, an undercover air marshal (Cochran) must find a way to save the passengers before the plane is shot down by the military.

This movie was released in 2003, but might as well have been released 20 years earlier given its mindset. Hollywood never tires of vilifying Arab characters, but Air Marshal is so irredeemably embarrassing in its heavy-handed Islamophobia that one would almost think its an ironic statement against it. The whole movie actually feels like a farce on traditional action: moments of idiotic heroism (e.g. the captains roller coaster flying) flow smoothly into the most harebrained coincidences (e.g. the friendly stowaway), while women fawn over hero Dean for no real reason and a child (Luke Leavitt) is *almost* sucked out of a sprung window(SPOILER) an hour before he helps land the plane, putting his video game experience to good use.

Eli Danker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>) leads the hijackers, and even though his character is a walking clich, hes a rare example of competent acting in the film. Theres also good old Tim Thomerson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trancers/dp/B005B0QYTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trancers</a>&nbsp;series) playing a hostaged senator, but hes mainly there to pad the cast and doesnt do anything cool. Dean Cochran looks like hes enjoying himself but is stuck playing a completely unremarkable character. Its a relief when he can stop talking and fight, but the four cramped brawls likewise lack any shred of uniqueness (no shortage of slow motion, though). A narrow body jet is an awkward place to stage an action flick to begin with, but the characters don't care at all about wantonly firing guns  even purposely shooting the window that the aforementioned boy gets to see the outside of.

Id see another Dean Cochran action vehicle, if such a thing ever came about, but only if it were helmed by a completely different set of filmmakers. I haven't gotten into the ridiculously transparent special effects, but only because they're the least of this ones problems. Its worth skipping.",1458172800,,2928,5.752886836027714

7995312,1,B0000A0WKY,"This movie is a total piece of crap.

I went to the local Blockbuster Movie Rental service and decided to rent this flick, it seemed to have a catch title, and had a lot of good reviews on the cover. Seemed like I treated myself, huh?

Think again!!!

The acting in this movie is teribble. You can tell that people have forgotten their lines (not to mention the actors are bad themselves). The movie is rated R, which I can understand, due to a lot of saying f***, stabbing, gun shots, and sexual references.

The plane when it is flying in the sky is so computer animated. It does not look real at all.

The main plot is that a group of terrorists decides to hijack a small CRJ-700 Jet (for all of you that has no idea what that is, it is a small jet usually used from city to city for short flights). Little do they know that an air marshal (played by Dean Cochran) is on board and ""will save the day."" The terrorists hide guns in the first-aid box on the plane,knives out of backpack straps, and steal tazers from the LOCKED cabin. Imagine that. After many graphic,violent scenes, and an almost hit with a civilain cruise ship liner, they land safely in some field on some remote island.

If you want to waste your time on a movie I can guarantee you won't like, get this. If you want something better, try Air Force 1.

Last Word:

This would make an excellent Barney episode.",1125705600,2,1380,4.301158301158301
7995313,3,B0000A0WKY,"AIR MARSHAL is certainly not cinematic brilliance in any form.  Given the redundant plot of terrorists taking over a plane, we know what to expect:  A hunky lead (Dean Cochran who has a certain jovial appeal); fanatical terrorists (Eli Danker and Ammar Darasieh); loyal flight attendants, a governmental figure (stoic Tim Thomerson) and his flirtatious drug-addled daughter.  You mix them all together, put the plane in peril on several occasions, and you end up with this grade B actioner.  All in all, I've seen worse, and even though the CGI effects are pretty mundane, AIR MARSHAL is passable 90 minutes of schlock fun.",1112313600,,623,5.019417475728155
7995314,1,B0000A0WKY,"I love airplane disaster films, even one as ""bad"" as the TV-movie ""Horror at 37,000 Feet,"" but ""Air Marshal"" is embarrassing! It is so badly written, badly acted, and badly made, this airplane disaster movie is a DISASTER unto itself. The prologue made no sense and you couldn't even connect it to the rest of the movie. The model used for the shots of the plane in flight is so blatantly obvious to be a model, even down to the white-painted centers of the wheels on the landing gear, and it did not look like it was flying, but computer-pasted on a bland sky background. It's the kind of thing cinema students would make for their cinema class. What really killed it for me were (1) the plane rolling smoothly on the rough terrain of grass without the landing gear buckling, (2) for the kid (a) to remain unaffected by witnessing the terrorist slit the pilot's throat, and (b) to know how to lower the landing gear, and (3) for the flight attendant to say and do nothing regarding the kid while all that was going on. So, unless you're studying bad movies, include it in a ""bad movie"" festival or marathon, or thinking of giving it to the crew of MST3K to watch and make comments, avoid this movie at ALL COSTS!
However, if the story intrigues you, then the best movie to watch is ""Executive Decision"" with Kurt Russell or ""Air Force One"" with Harrison Ford. Actually, I think someone here saw ""Executive Decision,"" and thought to himself, ""I can make that kind of a movie.""",1111795200,4,1476,4.5111940298507465
