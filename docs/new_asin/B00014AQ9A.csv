8006230,1,B00014AQ9A,"I bought this concert on Laser disc several years ago and was blown away by the music and excellent production.  Unfortunately, when I saw that it was available on DVD I rushed to buy it but it's a big let down.  The disc is NOT good.  Poor quality and poor sound.  I looks like it was struck from an old VHS copy or worse.  I can't tell if this is a new edition since I gave my DVD away and have no way of comparing the distributor. But I think this is the same version I bought.",1214956800,8,480,3.9072164948453607
