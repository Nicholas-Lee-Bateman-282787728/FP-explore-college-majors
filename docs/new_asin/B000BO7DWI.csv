2431839,4,B000BO7DWI,"This review contains some spoilers about plots and storylines but not about resolutions to those plots.  This was another good season of the Sopranos.  However, one of the actors called it a ""Brokeback Season.""  Seemingly, after the box office release of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" the producer David Chase want to touch upon a subject heretofore pretty neglected in the series.  The character Vito Spatafore had already been shown in the previous season to be homosexual.  Now he is accidently ""outed"" and goes on the lam.  The only ""sensitivity"" shown toward Vito is, ironically, via Tony Soprano. The question is whether the series was trying to turn The Sopranos into a PC treatment of the subject or was remaining true to its overall trajectory, which was to mostly skirt political correctness as much as possible in favor of portraying how things really are in the world.  Tony does have some legitimate ""reasons"" why he's not as upset about the revelation about Vito's sexuality as the others. For one, Vito was a top earner.  Two, Tony has been on a live-let-live kick since leaving the hospital.  And there is the added possibility of perhaps him having had some experience during his brief stint behind bars.  Overall, though, the series remains more true to itself than serving as a handmaiden to political correctness.  Vito may be homosexual, but he is otherwise no better and no worse than the other mobsters.  In fact, in this season and in the previous one, he both threatens and comes on to the hetero boyfriend of Tony's daughter Meadow.  In this season, he creepily gropes his arm.  But the Vito storyline isn't the only one in this season.  This is also the season Tony winds up in the hospital, and there is a great storyline about the dreams (or perhaps weird spiritual experiences) he has while in an induced coma.  I thought this story arc powerful and well done.  SO buy this season if you want to watch all of the Sopranos.  Me, I could have done without the Vito subplot, but it's in there.",1430006400,,2012,4.765895953757226
2431840,4,B000BO7DWI,"I wasn't to keen on the way it ended but from what I heard I'll be more upset at the end of the entire series. I love Paulie he is my favorite, Christopher is a junkie I can't deal with that. Yo the Vito plot line was hilarious I was definitely surprised about that one.",1429056000,,270,3.9272727272727272

Season 6- The first 12 of The final 21.
Amazing final season for one of TV's all-time finest! The Saga of Jersey crime fam comes to a close as Tony is Shot and on his deathbed. Anthony Jr. feels compelled to even the score.  Chris resumes his pursuit of Hollywood Sir Ben Kingsley and Lauren Bacall as well.
With a kid on the way Chris gets married, buys a home, falls off the wagon, then has a bachelor party.  Johnny gets a prison day-pass for his daughter's wedding just long enough to lose all street cred. Artie and the restaurant are struggling.  Paulie learns he isn't who who he thought he was and Vito, outted, goes into hiding in New Hampshire. Phil Leotardo, now running Brooklyn in Johnny's stead, continues to press Tony's buttons. ER's Julianna Margulies briefly joins the cast as goomar and enabler to Chris. All this and the Feds are hot to nail Tony's gang. While Tony's recovery may have lead him to struggle with boredom, that's not the case for the viewer. There are no weak stories this season. ""Join the Club"" & ""Mayham"" are two amazing episodes, mid-season closer Kaisha is terrific.

Let's review what we've learned from the Sopranos:  the Family comes first, never break a soldier's oath, a little therapy never hurts, the Don't-ask-Don't tell policy works best for mob wives and goomars, you don't have to eat every dish of Rigatoni, e.g. don't sleep with the Boss' ex-mistress, 'Made men' shouldn't play competitive Monopoly and absolutely do not be a Rat!

As my 15th anniversary re-screening comes to a close I gotta say the series, as a whole, has aged well like a fine italian wine.",1404172800,,1737,4.660130718954249

2431898,5,B000BO7DWI,"While the Vito storyline was kind of annoying/stupid, this season as a whole, both parts of 6 I'm talking about, were a hell of a way to wrap up one of the top 5 series in TV history. Breaking Bad may have topped it, but they sure ripped off some ideas from the Sopranos: Walt going to New Hampshire like Vito, splitting the last season into part 1 & 2, and going out while the show was still in its prime. I cant believe David Chase is considering a sequel especially after James Gandolfini died. DOes anyone really think AJ is going to take over the family business? He used a Mac not a PC!",1403568000,,592,4.156521739130435
2431899,3,B000BO7DWI,"Interesting to see the mafia portrayed in a positive light. With hit-men as the good guys and law enforcement as the bad. Sometimes theres a fine dividing line as when their methods drive a foot soldier bent on retiring to commit suicide rather than become an informer. This is not a show for the squeamish. In the opening episode one character gets beaten until he ends up on life support, final notice indicates multiple bullets to someones head, someone hangs himself, and Tony is shot by his demented uncle. Business as usual it seems. One marvels that professional criminals can get away with so much violence with seeming inpugnity.

The program has its own unique moral compass and logic. As when Tony beats up his new muscle-bound bodyguard for no good reason just to prove that he can to re-establish dominance over his crew in the wake of his hospitalization. It also introduces you to its own jargon. Biangaleen is bleach, a BBQ means a business will be blown up, such euphemisms abound. Season Six was issued in two parts. By the second box-set it becomes apparent that the series writers were running out of ideas. The episode at the cottage dragged, this isn't On Golden Pond but a much more disfunctional and distopian look at relaxing at the lake. Little is as it seems here where men who despise one another exchange polite greetings and kiss. The late night meeting between Tony and Hesh being a case in point, the bedroom scene after demonstrating Heshs true feelings.

Tony warned his nephew Christopher what would happen if he ever got back on drugs. The murder isn't as disturbing as the fact that Tony can lie about it with a straight face deceiving even his own wife. Despite inter-family warfare Tony survives and the series ends with Tony, Carmella, and the two kids having dinner at a local Italian Greasy Spoon.",1400889600,,1839,4.74375

And Season 6, which represents the decline and fall of Tony's world is close to extraordinary both in the depiction of the deterioration and in its ordinariness. The phrase ""crime doesn't pay"" applies to both Elmore Leonard's work and to the Sopranos......criminals are usually petty and not terribly bright.....they make mistakes and get caught.....no ""code of honor"" keeps enough secrets....and if the cops don't get you, well your buddies will. Tony Soprano lives through all this. Combined with his years of therapy (panic attacks, Mother issues, living up to his father's life) and his guy next door qualities and you want The Sopranos to go on forever. It doesn't.

2431966,5,B000BO7DWI,"This is not a TV show. This is true art. If you have seen the first 5 seasons of The Sopranos, you must finish the journey. ""Who am I? Where am I going?"" A show that not only dares to ask and answer these big questions, it presents a narrative on par with the great novels of the 19th century. Much more than just hoodlums cracking skulls and eating pasta--this story probes the intricacies of realistic family dynamics, examines and exposes ethnic stereotypes, delves into psychiatry & man's ability (or inability) to truly change, and even ventures into Purgatory. All the while, there are enough omens and literary references to keep your mind working on several levels during each episode. Like a great book you must re-read, these episodes demand re-watching to soak in all the details that make the story complete. So do not rent these discs--buy this set if you have already viewed the first 5 seasons. The DVDs I bought were in great condition, as have been all the seasons I have purchased through Amazon. And at this price, why would anyone go pay double at a store?",1285113600,,1076,4.638743455497382
2431967,4,B000BO7DWI,"I'm going to be honest here; I personally find this to be the worst season in what has proven to be the greatest television experience of my life.  That said, I'm going to be honest yet again; regardless of that statement this is still better television than nearly anything else out there.  Yes, the storylines are not as fresh and intriguing as they have been (before and after, since the second half of season six is a goldmine), but this does not really take away from the show in any detrimental way.

Some people have totally defended this season and claimed it to be rich with character development, maybe even more so than any seasons before it.  I have to hold them up right there, because the issue to me is not the `development' but more or less the way they attempt that development.  I can see where they were going with things and I can understand their thinking, but I just don't think that things work as well as they would have liked.

Let it be said that the season still works rather well, just not as well as it could have.

Opening with a bang (and by bang I mean gunshot), Season Six finds Tony in a coma after Uncle Junior, in a bout with insanity, takes a shot (literally) at him.  With Tony out of the picture our focus seems to navigate towards his confused and conflicted family; immediate and extended.  As far as character development is concerned, to me the one who goes through the most engaging development is Carmela.  She has to grapple so much physically, but also emotionally as she struggles with her own feelings for Tony.  As she sits by his bedside she is tormented with conflicted feelings of love, hate, remorse and regret.  A.J. also has some nicely placed ranges of emotional fluctuations.  His vow of revenge against Junior is a good identity crisis for him and goes to show the long reaching effects of the family business.

As far as Tony's development is concerned, it's just not as accessible as it should be.  While in his coma he undergoes a strange identity crisis.

""Who am I?  Where am I going?""

The issue I had with this plot point is that it wasn't constructed in a lasting way.  I can see where they wanted to go with it, but in the end it just didn't have the power or emotional pull I expected it to have.  I really wanted it to just nail the complexity of Tony, and the dreamlike state would have been a perfect avenue to do that, but in the end it wound up being overlong and underwhelming.

Overlong and underwhelming seems to be the main issue I have with another plot point as well.

So let's talk about Vito for a minute.

I am not one who thinks the sub-plot involving his promiscuity is unnecessary or even a hindrance; but like I mentioned above, it too is overlong and underwhelming.  I actually thought that `outing' Vito was a nice change of pace for the show and gave it another avenue to explore.  The fact that the show has remained entertaining for 6 complete seasons is a true testament to good writing, and part of that writing involves exploring other avenues of life not directly related to the mob so-to-speak; but this gave it a chance to keep these circumstances within the mob mentality, thus leading to some very interesting (and gory) conclusions.  The issue I have is the fact that the Vito situation could have been summed up much quicker than it was, and dragging it out like they did took away from the edge of the show for me; just a tad.  I was never a fan of the character, even in the earlier seasons, and so having whole segments dedicated to his life and lifestyle didn't rest easy with me.

Oh well.

The season as a while is still very entertaining, and with Christopher's rise to fame in the movie industry (immersing himself after losing Adriana...UGH) the show has some witty and sometimes outright hilarious moments that bring a color and vibrancy to the often times gloomy proceedings.  With dark developments in Johnny Sack and Phil Leotardo's future, as well as some life changing circumstances in Paulie's life, `The Sopranos Season 6 Part 1' is thrilling and intriguing and a nice set up for what happens to be the most enthralling segment (that would be part 2 of this very season).

Performance wise, well, what more can I say.  In every review I've done for this show I made the same raves.  Gandolfini is beyond flawless every season, although the writing for the first few episodes made him rather bland at times.  Still, no one could ever have played this man they way he did, and with the right amount of emotional complexity no doubt.  I was really impressed with Edie Falco this season.  Her characters development is made so devastatingly real by her powerful command of this woman.  She is such a force, and has been since season one!  Vince Curatola is just one of my favorite things about this show, seriously, and I am in silent ecstasy every time he's on the screen.  He just `gets' it, effortlessly.  I just feel head over heals for Juliana Marguilles.  She should seriously guest star on every show.  Between this and her stint on `Scrubs' I'm just completely in love with her now (and I was NOT a fan before this).

So, while it is not the best of the series, it is still the best show ever made (I'm so giddy for the potential `Mad Men' has at actually challenging `The Sopranos' title in the near future) and this season is still exciting, entertaining and fundamentally necessary to the development of this staggering series.",1249862400,,5453,4.532719836400818
2431968,4,B000BO7DWI,"There are many things to admire in this season of The Sopranos but it was not created for newbies.  This season was made for people who had been watching The Sopranos starting at the beginning of the show and viewed it all the way through.  The characters don't change much and seem to dig down deeper and deeper into their ways.  While it is incredulous that these people aren't caught in any shape or form (except Johnny Sack) the family keeps functioning and enjoys a welcome Christmas together.  A shooting occurs in the beginning which apparently makes Tony appreciate life more but only his life, not others.  A gay character accidentally comes out into the open and of course, no one is willing to pull the plug on the operation and lead a normal non-lethal form of life.  That is if you don't count AJ!  I formed a deeper appreciation for this season, now that I'm not expecting something that would connect the show to the life and verve it had in the first 3 seasons.  The photography is darker, the actors are older and less exciting to watch but they keep their lifestyle intact and coming.  The acting of the main characters is always superlative but some of the minor characters are given inflated roles which hit the limit with acting ability and story line believability.  Mainly Paulie's temper tantrum and life problems.  Still a good show.",1248652800,,1358,4.663865546218488

2431982,5,B000BO7DWI,"Season 6 Part One of the Sopranos begins to set the scene for the series finale.  At least that's how I viewed it.

We also begin to see characters growing up and changing due to recent events, like AJ handeling his fathers coma.  We see the tensions with NY start coming to a head, a showdown, which is where it's been headed all along.

I thought Season 6 was a strong season.  Not my favorite, as I still felt the Chris storyline weak.  I didn't mind the Vito, it was sort of funny and unexpected, but yes maybe it didn't have to go on for so long.  And I admit that AJ gets on my nerves more and more.  But I found the relationship between NY & NJ fascenating, I couldn't look away.  The tension is building and building with each episode until you are just dying to know how it ends!!

2431984,3,B000BO7DWI,"I agree with the Amazon review on two points.

First, the Vito story line overstayed its welcome in epic proportions. What should have been a minor subplot in the season became its centerpiece instead (sharing almost equal screen time with Tony's recuperation and lessons learned).

Second, after 5 seasons of significant season finales, the low-key, ""so what"" episode in Season 6 Part 1 seemed like more of a ploy to dash audience expectations than to craft something of quality. When the ""Season 6 Part 1 and 2"" plan was announced, the immediate reaction from series fans was to hold out hope for a season 7, season 8, season 9...and my personal belief for the entire 12 episode run of Season 6 Part 1 was that creator David Chase was trying to wean his audience from their stubborn attachment. The fact that Season 6 Part 2 came back with a vengeance supports this.

The one strength of the somewhat tedious story arcs in Season 6 Part 1 is Tony's ongoing ""If they perceive you as weak"" paranoia, but once again, it's played out in a clumsy manner during his altercation with ""Penne Arrabiatta"" at Satriale's.

If the Sopranos seasons could be expressed in terms of Rolling Stones albums, this would be ""Their Satanic Majesties Request""...some mildly interesting elements that never quite gel into a satisfying whole and only leave us hungry for the hopefully better efforts that follow.",1210982400,,1390,4.852320675105485

2432010,4,B000BO7DWI,"After five brilliant seasons of ""The Sopranos"", the groundbreaking HBO series finally took a slight nosedive for the first half of season six. While ""The Sopranos"" Season Six, Part One has its share of great moments, it doesn't quite stand up to the first five seasons. Many of the series' regulars return again (James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco, etc.), and they all do a great job as they have done in the past. But there are a few episodes that come off weak, and this is thanks in part to a storyline that just didn't belong here. The storyline involving one of Tony Sopranos' capos who turns out to be gay was unnecessary. This type of storyline might work on some shows and movies, but in the case of ""The Sopranos"" it just didn't work. Not to mention the storyline ends in predictable fashion. I saw the ending to this storyline coming a mile away. On the other hand, most of the episodes come off as superb as they have in the first five seasons. The first episode where Tony gets shot by Uncle Junior at the end is a great one, and the next few episodes that follow (where Tony recovers in the hospital) are as good as it gets. Another great episode is the one where aspiring writer Christopher flies out to California and meets Ben Kingsley and Lauren Bacall. The scene where a masked Christopher mugs Bacall is a riot. Just listening to the legendary actress using the F-word had me laughing out loud. And there's some good work from former ""ER"" star Julianna Margulies, who pops in for a couple of guest appearances. Emmy voters also seemed to have gotten a little tired of the show. For season six part one, it received only seven nominations, the fewest nominations the show has received for a single season. Although it was nominated again for Best Drama Series, Gandolfini and Falco were passed over for nominations in the Lead Actor and Actress categories. Michael Imperioli (who plays Christopher) was the only series regular to receive a nomination. ""The Sopranos"" only won one Emmy for season six part one, and it was for a category that it has dominated during the show's long run: Best Writing for a Drama Series. This was its fifth Emmy in this category, and that's fitting because one of the major strengths of ""The Sopranos"" has always been sharp writing. So I wasn't surprised when it won this category. Although it's not as great as it once was, ""The Sopranos"" - Season Six, Part One is still a very good season. It also sets up for the conclusion of the show, with its final episode set to air June 10, 2007. It will be interesting to see what will happen to Tony Soprano.",1179705600,,2612,4.559574468085106

2432023,2,B000BO7DWI,"I can't believe all the positive reviews this season is getting. Compared to previous seasons, season six is like a completely different show. I have watched every episode religiously on Sunday nights since season one. I can honestly say that this is the only season where I actually became bored and lost much interest in the show all together. A lot of fluff, with no substance at all.

It's almost as if the creators ran out of ideas, so they put Tony in a coma and focused on the EXTREMELY stupid storyline concerning Vito. As other reviewers stated, Vito is outed at a gay club and has to go on the lamb to avoid his ultimate demise. That's great, but it has nothing to do with the main storyline because Vito isn't even a major character! I remember saying to myself after every episode ""Wow, that episode was terrible"". I would hope that next weeks would be better, but it never happened.

Anyway, this season has some good parts, but for the price it is hardly worth buying unless you are a collector like myself. It doesn't give the Sopranos justice for being one of the greatest series ever, like previous seasons do. In order to really save this show, David Chase is going to have to string together one hell of a final season. Wait for a price drop on this one.",1174608000,,1273,4.459227467811159

2432035,5,B000BO7DWI,"I seem to have a different opinion from so many other viewers, since I really enjoyed the first half of season six. Seeing Tony get shot, not by season one's physically and mentally vigorous Uncle Junior, as I had kept anticipating that season, but by the toothless demented Uncle Junior, believing he was shooting someone else entirely was priceless irony. I loved the part with Tony in the coma in our world, while -wherever he was - he was exactly what he had always dreaded being - a nobody. Worse, he's a traveling salesman who is ""trapped"" and unable to get home. When Tony comes out of his coma, he vows to change and take every day as a gift, but later he is gradually pulled back into his old ways, since his position as boss really gives him no alternative.

Lots of people didn't like the Vito mini-arc, but I loved it. After being outed in the most conspicuous and non-ambiguous way imaginable, Vito finds it necessary to leave town to avoid Phil's wrath. He arrives in small-town New Hampshire, and there he winds up luckier than he deserves to be. He finds love in the Morgan Spurlock look-alike cook ""Johnny Cakes"" at the local diner, and the two move in together. Vito's new love is even able to overlook Vito's obvious moral failings, such as his lies about his true occupation. Johnny Cakes hooks him up with a job, and Vito has escaped the death sentence that awaits him back home, with a pretty Norman Rockwell-ish life in his current situation and a shot at genuine happiness. The problem is - Vito is still Vito. To him what 99% of people face every day - rising early to go to a job that is genuine hard work for average pay - is purgatory to him. He misses the all-night card games, the big city life, and the fact that making a living there just involves sitting around a construction site and making collections. Thus Vito runs out on Johnny Cakes and goes back to New Jersey, thinking he can make things right and get back into ""the life"". Just in case we have any doubt Vito has changed, there is a little incident on his way back home that lays our doubts to rest.

I think the Vito arc superimposed on Tony's shooting and recovery just drive home the fact that even though these guys think they're king of all they survey, ""the life"" really owns them all, not vice versa. They're kidding themselves to think otherwise. Tony believed he could make things different, and Vito believed he could make things the way they had been before. Both were wrong.

There are also lighter moments. The scene with Christopher brainstorming his movie project with the ""help"" of his kidnapped and beaten AA sponsor is hilarious, as is his mugging Lauren Bacall just to get her gift basket. Then there's the matter of Paulie finding out he is not who he thought he was. All-in-all a worthwhile and thought-provoking 12 episodes.

However, I still think I'll wait until after season six has completed airing to buy. The series will definitely be over by then, and I am anticipating some kind of ""Collector's Edition"" for the whole series. I just don't want to wind up with buyer's remorse like I did with the separate seasons of ""Homicide"" that I bought, only to have the entire series come out in a collector's edition that was much cheaper than the individual seasons with all kinds of bonus footage to boot.",1169510400,,3321,4.548494983277592

How flat? Flat enough to make any viewer with a keen production eye guess that one or two of the mid-season episodes might have been strung together using sequences scripted and shot with other possible uses in mind.

2432056,4,B000BO7DWI,"As someone who has actually bought this set I thought I might offer some real opinions as opposed to those of some idiot who's only contribution is he hates HD.

(note: at this time I have only watched the first two episodes)

The Audio

Audio is in Dolby Digital Plus and is sublime.  As a drama series, dialogue is paramount and every syllable can be clearly discerned.  Tony's signature laboured breathing comes through crystal clear.  Background dialogue adds atmosphere and sounds like actual conversation, not just noise.

Surround information is not a strong point of this series, however, when needed it is there.  In episode 2 the helicopter (of Tony's subconscious) utilizes all channels to great effect.

A strong point in the series is it's use of modern classic music.  This is used to great effect and on the HD-DVD release is output evenly through all channels.  The music here is better than any SA-CD or DVD-A I have heard and really gets me excited as to the possibility of music through the new format.

The Picture

I am a big fan of television on DVD having collected many series.  That said, I am usually disappointed with the transfers afforded television series.  Most suffer from artefacts due to over-compression to fit as many episodes on a disc as possible.  So with that in mind I'll discuss the bad first.

There is some moir effect in the background of some scenes.  Early in the first episode I had one instance of a freeze which put the audio out of sync.  Pausing and un-pausing fixed this and I could not replicate this effect so rather than blame the set, I suspect it is one of those bugs that comes with early technology and Gen 1 machines.  There is some grain in the image, however, given the previous season's, this is an intentional decision on the makers part (it will be interesting to see what the advent of HD in the home will do to this practice as it is not very HD friendly).  At one stage on the first episode the Picture quality faulted for a period of about  of a second where in a dark scene it became almost SD standard.  This was very quick but noticeable.

Now for the good, and boy is it good.  The detail is spectacular (almost too good - these guys are getting on in age, and they never were the most attractive people, and that hole in Tony's stomach - I though it looked bad before but this is truly disgusting).  I have never seen TV look this good - not even the so called HD broadcasts of these very same episodes on Australian TV came close to this.  Most of the action is in the foreground of this series and as such the detail in background shots is not as sharp as some film releases, however, when the background is relevant all that detail comes back.  Again I think this is a conscious decision on the makers part to keep the focus up close and on the characters.

Final Thoughts

Is this release perfect - no, it has some slight issues that could be improved upon.  Was it worth getting in HD - absolutely.  Even at a premium price over the SD release I will happily pick up more of my favourites on HD-DVD.  Universal has given a tentative commitment to Battlestar Galactica on HD-DVD, BBC has stated a HD-DVD release of Torchwood is in the works (which means we will probably also see Dr Who as well).  MGM has hinted at a release of Stargate: Atlantis on Blu-ray and I would highly suspect the 2 new SG-1 movies (in lieu of Season 11) will be released on Blu-ray around April/May.  It is almost inevitable that Paramount will release Star Trek to High Definition (especially the re-mastered and re-worked High Def Original Series).

I collect more Television series than movies these days (well, television and anime) and I gotta say, if this is the future of serialized programming, then I am happy to have a HD-DVD player and should Blu-ray get their format specific series out, I'll be grabbing one of those machines too (you listening on those Stargate movies and series?).",1167696000,,3952,4.5324858757062145
2432057,4,B000BO7DWI,"I thought Season 6, part 1 was the weakest season thus far, but still kept my attention. I agree with past reviews that Tony's coma could have involved fewer episodes, and the Vito Bedroom scence could have been left to one's imagination, but the expansion of A.J.'s character, and Phil's character more than made up for these shortfalls. I also agree that although ""Kaiesha"" is episode 12 out of 20, it should have been a more explosive episode, given we will wait quite some time for episode 13. I have bought season 6 part 1, and do not regret it",1166140800,,549,4.5
2432058,4,B000BO7DWI,"The bad news is that this is only part of season six, so the payoff to all the plot lines isn't there, and the set just sort of ... ends.

The good news is that there's been a ton of great set-up for the end of the season and if the payoff is half as good as the set-up, season six, in its entirety, will definitely be a series high water mark.

And it's not that there aren't great stories told in this half of the season, either. In particular, Vito finally takes center stage and the Soprano family's relationship with the New York mob takes several violent twists.

As an incomplete season, this DVD set is unsatisfying in that so many plot threads are left dangling. If this is the kind of thing that will bother you (it seems to bother a lot of people), wait on the next DVD set being released before picking this up.",1165795200,,823,4.19620253164557
2432059,3,B000BO7DWI,"Having watched the Sopranos now six seasons on, one begins to feel that all good things--even a series like this--needs to come to dignified and inevitable end. The cracks in Tony's crime empire have now become all the more apparent as we begin to witness the nadir of the series.

With the ""accidental"" shooting of Tony by Uncle Junior (suffering from progressive dementia) is offered as a fait accompli, Paulie's discovery that Aunt Dottie is his real mother, and the execution of Tony's captain, Vito, for his homosexuality, The Sopranos seems to expound more melodrama akin to a daytime soap opera than the hard hitting, nail-biting, dramatic series about a mob boss, his family, and his lieutanants we have grown accustomed to over the last several years.

So what is the problem with this season? For one thing, it would appear that the majority of characters don't seem to have much to do. For example, Meadow and Tony Jr. are now reduced to set pieces and, unfortunately, really bring nothing of value to the series or the story as a whole--Meadow, now a quasi-law-cum-quasi-medical student, interning in a public law firm, is merely a mouthpiece to expound writer David Chase's tiresome protestations against President Bush and the Administration's policies toward middle easterners and the War on Terror ad nauseam. Have we not seen this all before? As for Tony Jr., he has nothing better to do other than drop out of college or respond with a four letter expletive when asked by Carmella to bring something from home to the hospital. Dull.

With Johnny Sack in prison, the tension between Tony and the families on the opposite sides of the fence is clearly missing and we begin to see the these mobsters as mere ciphers of their former selves--Christopher wants to pursue screenwriting, Tony, out of a coma, contemplates Evangelical Christianity, forgiveness, and a life without the mob, and Bobby offers to shoot a rap star for five thousand dollars--non-fatally of course--so that the rapper can capitalize on the publicity like Tu Pac. One wonders if The Sopranos will make a debut in later seasons as a situation-comedy.  It would all be interesting, if it actually helped to move or accelerate the story forward; unfortunately it doesn't.

Even Tony's sessions with the insightful Dr. Melfi lack the typical critical banter and insight that were once a window into Tony's true character and soul.  The episode, ""Luxury Lounge"" is, more or less, played for laughs with guest appearances by Ben Kingsley and Lauren Bacall, and more of a social commentary on the cult of celebrity and begs the question how advertisers compensate and shower award presenters with lavish gifts. Christopher, expressing our own sentiment and, perhaps some envy, says blankly to Kingsley, ""You mean like all this stuff is f****** free?""

The series still has the capacity to deliver the dramatic moments we have come to expect, but these are now too far and few between. Some sequences, like Tony's ""dream"" during his coma and the guest appearance of Hal Holbrook as a cancer patient who opens Tony's mind to the philosophical mysteries of life is a thoughtful and creative touch. But now the series begins to feel like an assemblage of our favorite relatives and friends at our table over for a traditional Italian feast, only they have overstayed their welcome and we wished they would go home.",1164326400,,3389,4.955985915492958

The poem is an appropriate choice, and attentive viewers will be rewarded by keeping it in mind while watching this final season.

This DVD, including Part-One only, puts our now very familiar hero on the road to transformation.  Where exactly we find him at the end, celebrating Christmas wearing a French beret & witnessing his own son's transformation, each viewer must conclude for themselves.

The season begins, after a fast-paced hour (""Member's Only"") involving a disturbing and comically miserable suicide, with Tony shot by his arch enemy and falling into a deep coma.  There he finds himself stuck in a Southern California airport hotel, slowly loosing his identity and memory to become mixed up with a (imaginary?) solar heating systems salesman from Arizona named Kevin Finnerty.  He awakes from his coma, returned to New Jersey, but feeling ""not myself.""

In the wake of the Boss's shooting, the men around Tony seem at first to be reenergized, but suddenly begin to face a painfully comic series of challenges to their crumbling facades of masculine strength, and subsequent crisis of identities. The linchpin here is the secretly homosexual Vito, who, exposed, flees to a gay paradise in a New Hampshire hamlet (""Live Free or Die""), surrounded by handsome, rugged motorcycle riding, gay volunteer fireman.

Here Vito too slips his skin before our eyes to become a happy, almost different person...only to sabotage himself, fleeing NH after enduring one honest day's work, shooting a poor homeowner on his drive back to NJ.  We also witness Jonny Sack's public tears at his daughter's wedding, Silvio's hospitalizing asthma, Bobby submission to his wife and retreat to his toy train set, Paulie ""You're doing a heck of a job"" Walnuts, & ""drop the knife"" A.J. are all examples of this masculine projection collapsing. But Vito's outing is the most public and embarrassing for everyone.

This well worth the price 6th season DVD, with a very revealing audio commentary from Creator David Chase, continues The Sopranos' dramatization of a creeping sense of decline in modern American life. ""Things are trendin' downward..."" Tony observed to Dr. Melfi in the series 1999 premier. He said that while we see him read a newspaper headline, ""Clinton Warns Medicare Could Be Bust By 2001.""  The character's dilemma here in 2006 resembles the very public collapse of the current White House administration's projections of unbending masculine strength, authority, and competence. I'm thinking specifically about the type of male character personified in the former secretary of defense, the vice president, and the president himself. Attempted personification, I guess I should say.

The current weak American dollar is mocked in the episode ""Luxury Lounge."" While Chris goes uncomprehendingly bananas for the free ""swag"" he sees being given away in Hollywood, the Italian assassins are flying home (in the final scene) laughing about the loot they have purchased cheap, taking advantage of the weak U.S. currency.  David Chase is pointedly sitting across the aisle in this scene, going oversees himself.

But the real story remains Tony and his emotional reaction to the shooting.  Whether his trauma has brought him real spiritual or moral insight, or the wisdom to avoid disaster for himself and his family, Part 2 should answer.  But so far, Season 6 is probobly the best season since #3, and essential viewing for fans who have been following Tony Soprano's emotional life from the beginning...",1163808000,,3694,5.193602693602694
2432062,5,B000BO7DWI,"I honestly expected to be somewhat dissapointed by this season after reading some of the negative attention it had received. (I don't have HBO, so I have to wait for the DVD's). But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first part of Season Six is pretty strong.

It has some muddy parts... there are some structural problems with the story arch, and it would have served the season right to have a cliffhanger at the end to keep us on our toes for the ""Final Eight"".

However, the season as a whole is uniformly strong up to this point. About half the season is above average to great... with the remaining episodes being of the average quality (or slightly below par). There aren't any trainwrecks along the lines of ""Christopher"" (arguably the worst Sopranos episode) to be found, so the season keeps your attention the whole way through.

It may not be able to stand against the classic Sopranos seasons quite yet, I'm going to wait for the rest of the episodes to pass proper judgement in that area. However, the first part of Season 6 is no slouch.",1163462400,,1060,4.539267015706806

2432064,5,B000BO7DWI,"Many people are complaining about the purchase price of this collection of 12 episodes (with 8 episodes on the way).  People are whinning because every season has been 13 episodes in length.  Also, keep in mind that the series is not yet finished; 8 more episodes will debut in 2007.  Season 6 will be 20 episodes total (in case you can't count... 12 + 8 = 20).

Consider the total running time of this collection:  12 episodes at 720 minutes.  This is signifficant...

Here's the breakdown:

Season 1: 680 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 2: 780 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 3: 780 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 4: 800 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 5: 780 Minutes in 13 episodes

Season 6, Part 2: --- Minutes in 8 episodes

Stop complaining about this pricetag on this set!  The price is well worth the cost when you consider the running time!  Season 6, Part 1 was just as good as Seasons 2,3,4, and 5.

The show had me laughing aloud even though I was the only person watching at my home.  The show imroves with age; The Sopranos are here to stay (even IF the series is drawing to a close).

2432065,4,B000BO7DWI,"Season Six is one of the most underrated of all of the Sopraons seasons. Setting us up for the show's final eight episodes, the producers do subordinate plot to character study, but with stunning results.  One of the central themes of the season--how, for all their mysoginistic bluster, the mafia men are so dependent on the women in their lives, and how they must come to face up to this--is fascinating and bold. From the beginning there's Eugene and his wife, Tony, Carm, and Meadow, Paulie and his mother, Bobby and Janice, Jonny and his soon-to-be-married daughter, the meanacing Phil and his wife and, yes, Chris and Ade (dead though she may be, her ghost is all throghout). Here the mafiosi have to face up to their own limitations and mortality in the starkest and, sometimes, cruelest ways. There are episodes that are as close to perfect as any in the series: the brilliantly hitchcokian Kiaisha among them. The time given to the ""gay mobster"" Vito for all the commotion it caused, is to be commended, since it sharply captures yet another of the seasons themes: the possibility of getting out of the life and material draw right back into it. Those who trash this season have missed the boat: Season Six greatly rewards careful and intelligent viewing.",1162771200,,1264,4.798165137614679

However, this season really doesn't get moving until the 5th episode or so, when Tony is out of the hospital.  I can only hope that the final 8 episodes redeem the lousy editing and slap-dash dialogue that punctuated this season's opening episodes.  The third episode was particularly bad, as though the producers were out to lunch, the cast only learned the script that morning, and the camera crew were playing hot potato with the lens.

I also don't believe they should be releasing this season in two parts, a la Sex In The City's 6th season.  I think that's a shameless cash-grab, and I won't be taken in.",1162512000,,800,4.489655172413793

This set has a hefty price for only 4 discs, although I'm sure this has to do with demand for the DVD (aka taking advantage of a thirsty public), as well as the quality of the program.  Let's hope we aren't being duped again.

Everyone knew he was gay , but they seemed to devote half the episodes just to vito . They coulda tied that story up in one , maybe two episodes .

In my opinion, the Sopranos has never been as good as season 1, but since they got the cult following and fame, it has always appeared that they have been trying to build up for an ultimate conclusion.  That's what kept me going.  Season after season more builds and builds.  More dreams, more association, more mistakes, more mafia politics.  It's great!  Season 6 tried to associate the dreams with the near death of Tony, which was done very well...  However, in a matter of 2 episodes or so Tony goes into a comma and Pauly finds out that his Mom isn't actually his Mom, but rather he was born from a nun.  You couldn't get any more clich SoapOpera scenarios if you tried.  I understand what they were trying to do.  They were trying to tie the dreams to death and give Pauly trust issues.  But this is just ridiculous.  Finally, when the show kicks back up a bit and Tony's back in action there is an elaborate side-plot about Vito and his gay relationships (including some scenes I would have rather not seen).  Lastly, they are breaking up the season into 2 parts.  This box set comes with 1 less episode than any other season, so the price is almost reasonable, but I'm afraid that the remaining 8 episodes will be just as expensive.",1160524800,,1284,4.5021645021645025

HD-DVD is better than Hi. Def. HBO.

2432080,3,B000BO7DWI,"First of all, I have to give some props to the Sopranos writers for keeping the show ALIVE for six seasons. That in itself is an accomplishment. That this new season is not as slam-bang as some of the others doesn't necessarily denote a step back.

I can see how a lot of people might feel that way, though, after the whack-packed fifth season, which I think stands with the first as the series' best.

And while the Vito storyline did kind of distract from the goings-on back in northern New Jerz, I thought it was very interesting to see how each main character reacted to the rumor and eventual truth about Vito's lifestyle; not to mention that the two scenes in which a) Meadow spills the beans to Carmela and Ro and b) Fin tells the 'family' what he saw with Vito (""Heeeeey, Dr. Yankum! The painless dentist!""... I still crack up just THINKING about that line, and Lil' Stevens hook-in-mouth mumbling that comes after), which inspire too much hilarity for me to even think about (""Sitting on the park bench/doo do do do doo dooo... what?"").

I have a strange feeling that the Julianna Skiff storyline is going to end up in some kind of serious confrontation between Tony and Christopher... it seems like just the thing to send Tony into a big enough rage to kill another made guy... and if it's Chris, who's very well-liked, that doesn't bode well for the Big Man.

Although I do have to agree with several other reviews about the ending of this first half of season 6 being complete garbage. Not one single (important) storyline had been resolved, I don't think.

But you know we'll all be back in front of the TV for the conclusion, so why belabor the point? I know everyone wants rock'em-sock'em episodes that they can talk about at the water cooler, but an introspective season where the characters continue to evolve and change? What's so bad about that?

Maybe the whole 20 episode season was just to much.

2432083,5,B000BO7DWI,"It's lonely in the ranks that believe that season 6 of The Sopranos was as good, if not better, than the seasons before it, but I am convinced that the first 12 episodes of season 6 are amongst the bravest, best written, and most telling episodes of the series.  The Sopranos has long been a show with the most complex, multi-layered characters on television, but by using the mantra of ""Who am I, where am I going"" as a rallying point, season 6 probed the nature of what drives its family, and gets in intense focus of who each of them is.  The problem, I think, was that it did its job TOO well this season - it's not that there wasn't action (the death count this year was as high as any other, and Tony does, after all, nearly die himself), but that because the show wanted so much to get the specifics of the ordinary right, it's easy to overlook the rather consternated implications of their everyday events.  What I mean is that in showing each character at his/her essence, we get what really drives them, but we don't necessarily get that explained to us - we, for example, identify with Carmela's sense of longing and uncertainty staring off at the Eiffel Tower, or we register that Paulie is adrift in guilt and anxiety over his actions in life, but we get it in the details of their everyday action and, these characters experiencing these implications alone, get little of that wrapped up for us.  To me, that speaks to a level of characterization and examination that doesn't exist in television and barely exists in film - it probes the specifics of its fictional characters so precisely, it winds up speaking to the heart of what drives Americans and the materialism of American culture that makes things like mobs possible.  In that, it brings forth insurance agent, real estate claimsmen and salesmen, actors, and (in one unforgettable shout-out) Dick Cheney - comparisons of the same urges.  Yet this season does more than critique the impulses, it allows them to exist, allows all of their very real virtues to be present, and lets them arise from its characters distinct, full-bodied personalities - money helps keep AJ out of jail, gets him laid, repairs Tony's relationship with his sister, keeps Carmela from probing too deeply into Adriana's murder, gets Tony reasonable health care, and nearly spares Vito's life and stops a cross-river gang war.  I may be alone in the level to which the Sopranos makes me think, but I do think David Chase's intentions are to use his astonishingly vivid characters to go into depth about the American mentality (or, they're not, and it's just a product of three dimensional writing).  However, even if it weren't, the season gives you extraordinary moments to savor - Paulie's confrontation with mortality (""The Ride""), Carmela crying at Tony's bedside (""Join The Club""), Christopher's gut-shaking relapse (""Kaisha,"" with a fearless guest turn by Juliana Marguilles), AJ's inability to carry out his ""big plan"" against Junior (""Johnny Cakes""), and, unforgettably, Philly's cold stare as his machinations to kill Vito are achieved (""Cold Stones"").  They're moments of magnificent acting that fulfill characters even as it surprises you with their humanity and personality.  And, in the premiere, ""Members Only,"" it gives you it all in an hour - a suicide, heart attack, and gun shot that seem to tell you everything you've ever needed to know about the mob life, about why they - if not you - do what they do.",1159056000,,3469,4.805369127516778
2432084,3,B000BO7DWI,"I think the thing that bothers me the most is how greedy HBO is.  First of all, you have to pay to get HBO.  Then, when they put their shows out on DVD, they price them much higher than any other television DVDs, despite the fact that they contain half as many episodes.  And, to add insult to injury, they break up the final season and sell it like it is 2 separate seasons.  They did the same thing with Sex and the City.

That being said, after spending some 18 months or however long it was, anticipating the final season of the Sopranos, I have to admit that in many ways I was disappointed.  I had no problem with the storyline about Vito.  Afterall, this storyline started in Season 5, and in Season 6, it was brought to full fruition.  However, the dream sequences were agonizingly drawn out.  They certainly didn't have to take up so much of the first 3 episodes.  I also found it rather odd that Meadow's boyfriend, who was featured so much in Season 5, was barely seen in the first half of this season.  Plus, there were several other minor characters who appeared in many episodes in the last few years, who were suddenly no where to be found.  Overall, with a couple of exceptions, most of the storylines were pretty shallow and disappointing compared to seasons past.

Before the season started, I fully expected that something might happen to Tony.  But, I was thinking it would be something like Furio returning from Italy and wacking Tony, like he wanted to do just before he fled to Italy.  I was also thinking that perhaps another main character would get wacked, like Paulie or Johnny Sack.  In other words, something more shocking than what occurred.  Vito was wacked, but that wasn't really shocking because you knew it was coming sooner or later.  I was thinking along the lines of what happened with Adriana or the character (played by Joe Pagalioni).  There was no way anyone could have anticipated Tony killing him in a rage over a dead horse.",1158364800,,1969,4.526912181303116
2432085,2,B000BO7DWI,"I think most Sopranos fans are reluctant to give the show, no matter how frustrating it can be, less than three stars.  I love the show too, but Season Six, Part One is a real disappointment.  On its own, I would not bother with buying these episodes.

I'm not going to harp on all the loose threads from the previous five seasons (and there are a lot) but at least come up with new storylines that rise to their level.

While Tony's hospital stay was good, his hallucinations that he was somebody else went on too long.  I really loved the episode where Tony gets to know his fellow patients, a rapper and a rocket scientist (the scientist played by Hal Holbrook).  That has to be one of the most thought-provoking episodes I've seen of this series.

My biggest complaint is that the only drive in this season was the development of Vito and his homosexuality.  Everyone else appeared to be adrift (Did we really need to go on vacation with Carmella?).  While Vito was finding romance in New Hampshire or wherever he went, I was wondering what was going on in New Jersey.  They spent so much time on his relationship with the firefighter/short order cook, I wanted him ""whacked"" just to get the show back to something resembling ""The Sopranos.""

(The one surreal moment: Tony complaining about how TV and the media keep stuffing homosexuality down the public's throat to Dr. Melfi...while most of this season appeared to be doing just that!)

By the last episode of this series, I was looking at the clock and thinking, ""You guys have got about forty mintues to do something with this...thirty...fifteen....""

I still love this show and I'll be there for the last episodes, but if the last episodes have the same amount of dead air as Season Six, Part One, we'll be discussing at which point ""The Sopranos"" jumped the shark.",1158278400,,1825,4.630434782608695
2432086,4,B000BO7DWI,"People complain that this season was weak, but I just don't think they understood it.  It was very reflective.  Everyone thought the dream episode with Kevin Finnity was stupid, but I disagree, it was amazing.  It is the episode that comes full circle, to use a Star Wars referance.  In this episode he says, ""who am I?  Where am I going?""  If you recall in the 1st season Melfi asks him if he has any qualms about what he does for a living & he says yeah.  He is questioning his life, & who hasn't done that at least once in their life?  That is what the whole title ""Join The Club"" meant.  Plus, remember the ducks?  They represented his fear that he is gonna lose his family.  At 1st you thought it was because they were always squabbling.  That could be part of it, but in this episode he was also near death.  I just hope that we find out who Kevin Finnity is, because I still feel this episode didn't exactly tie things up completely.  Though, it could be that Kevin Finnity was just a name to represent that Tony wasn't certain of who he is anymore, & that's really all there is to it.  Then there was Edie Falco's amazing performance.  I found that I REALLY felt for her, seeing Tony in a coma.  Plus this season had lots of character development.  With Tony in a coma you can focus on minor characters who are there, but always take back seat to him.  You find out Silvio has asthma, Paulie's mom is really his aunt, &, even though others hated this storyline, you found out Vito is gay.  Plus, we get to see Johnny Sack with his whole family.  The one problem I had with these things, however, is it seemed much too rushed.  These issues were there, & within a few episodes, quickly resolved.  I wish they had at least build it up like they did with Adrianna talking to the Feds,(though I'm sure many were glad that Vito's homosexuality was quickly resolved.)  The one thing I will admit about Vito's homosexuality, however, is, it did kinda seem like Chase wanted a gay character just so he could appease the gay community.  With Silvios asthma, I thought, ""ok, that was cool, but why havn't we ever seen him use an inhaler before?  Did he just come down with it?""  Another thing I didn't quite like was when Uncle June shot Tony.  But, this also goes back to the 1st season, in a way.  Because Tony tell Melfi he doesn't want Anthony Jr. to follow in his footsteps.  Which he almost does when he tries to kill Uncle June.  So, the shooting gives Anthony the reason for vengeance.  Plus, it gives an explination for Tony's dream when he is the coma.  But, the climax of that episode seemed almost tacked on, like Chase couldn't think of how to end it.  But, with the following episodes the shooting does come together, with Tony's new philosophy on life.  This season was sort of a redemption for Tony.  But there is one more thing I didn't enjoy about this episode, & that was the Florida subplot.  I found myself not really caring about Eugene.  Plus I thought the actor ""phoned in,"" as they say, his performance.  Plus I didn't like the way that guy,(can't recall his characters name,)died talking to the Feds.  His head just drops on his chin.  One of the dumbest looking deaths I've ever seen on film.  To me it almost looked like he was just falling asleep with his chin on his chest.  That is why I give this season 4 stars instead of 5.  But, despite these flaws, I still think this season was terriffic.  I can't wait for the last 8 episodes.",1158278400,,3462,4.3573667711598745
2432087,5,B000BO7DWI,Although this season has been bashed by many it's still the best show on all of television.  I think it's just perception and expectations.  People have in their mind what should happen and when it doesn't happen that way they are upset.  I just sit back and enjoy the show as I always have.  I believe there were actually only 3 Soprano crime family members killed not 4.  The other major killings were of New York faction.,1158192000,,424,4.454545454545454
2432088,4,B000BO7DWI,"This season of the Sopranos was probably the weakest of all six but it still remained a well written, directed and acted show on television. The season opener ""Members Only"" is one of the series' best episodes. The special features on the Sopranos DVDs are the commentaries and on this release there are four. The first comes from the second episode of the season: ""Join the Club"" and it features actors Edie Falco, Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler (Carmela, Meadow and AJ respectively), the second commentary is on episode 7 ""Luxury Lounge"" and it features writer Matthew Weiner, the third commentary is on episode 9 ""The Ride"" with writer Terence Winter and actors Michael Imperioli (Christopher) and Tony Sirico (Paulie), the last commentary is on the final episode 12 ""Kaisha"" with series creator and co-writer David Chase. Also featured on the DVD is a featurette on the upcoming video game based on the series. This was a dissapointing beginning for the final season of ""The Sopranos"" but the good news is that there are 8 episodes left to conclude the series. Stay tuned.",1158105600,,1079,4.901639344262295
2432089,3,B000BO7DWI,"The first part of the final season, for me, was slow-moving and had a lot of uninteresting storylines. Examples of slow-moving storylines include Tony's time in the hospital (three episodes) and Vito's homosexuality (six episodes). Examples of uninteresting storylines include Tony's mistaken identity while he's in a coma, Bobby's help on a rapper's career (kind of funny when he's shot), Christopher and Little Carmine's film project, Julianna Skiff's relationship with both Tony and Christopher and Carmela's trip to Paris. Although a lot of people are killed this season (four from the DiMeo Family [Soprano family]), I, somewhat, don't really care if people are killed or not and it annoys me that other people like this show only because of the violence. All I need are fast-moving, interesting, important, funny stories, with reasonable violence and I'm happy. My least favorite episodes from this season include Join the Club, Johnny Cakes and Kaisha. My favorite episodes from this season include Members Only, Mr. and Mrs. Sacramoni's Request and The Ride. Even though Kaisha was a weak episode, I understand (and everyone else should too) that it is an episode in the middle of a 20 episode season. People still don't understand but Kaisha was not a season finale but a mid-season episode. Although the first part of the sixth season had good and bad in it, I, and a lot of other people, expected great episodes. I really hope that the final nine episodes (April, 2007) will bring back the greatness The Sopranos once had.",1157846400,,1533,5.063241106719367

 There is a lamp in my living room. The central part of the lamp that holds the shade is transparent and hollow. You can see into the center of it.
 Often times when very tired I gaze into the center of the lamp and imagine it full of Cheddar popcorn.

 And maybe one day I run out of food and in an act of sheer desperation I eat the aforementioned Cheddar Popcorn.
 And maybe I never get around to it and just leave it in my mind as a pleasant thought I occasionally turn to for comfort.
