8691233,1,B00QGFE9EG,"Mexico, where the fighters gas out after 1 round. Just a terrible show. Poor Hunt is the last minute replacement for that mexican guy who used to be champion in between laying around in hospital beds. Sadly Hunt lays around eating cake and watching Jesus documentaries on tv in between fighting. He spent 3 weeks losing 70 lbs to make weight. He did the same thing in his next fight, even though he had months to do something OTHER than eat cake all day.
Aldo vs that shrimpy dude is a hard fought contest but hardly more than a stand up sparring match.
Good mma includes ground fighting throws and submission attacks. the ufc is little more than a tough man contest.

Check out the old Dream and Heros shows for some real frantic up and down mma battles.",1436054400,2,755,4.431654676258993
8691234,5,B00QGFE9EG,"There are 4 excellent fight in  UFC 180. They make it worth 5 stars.
Amazingly, 6 out of 7 fights ended in round 1!

Mark Hunt vs Fabricio Wardum
This was the best fight of this show but it ended quickly in round 1. Both fighters attacked from the beginning till the end. In round 1, Mark took down Fabricio but he could not capitalize on it. Again, in round 2, Mark knocked down Fabricio but Mark could not capitalize on it. Then Fabricio landed his knee on Mark's face. That knocked him down. Fabricio was on top of him and kep punching until the referee stopped the fight. It's unbelievable.

Dodger Montano vs Chris Heatherly
This is the third best fight of this show. It's fast and furious. Both fighters attacked non stop from the beginning till the end. It ended in the first round.

Gabriel Benitez vs Humberto Brown
This was the second best fight of this show. In round 1, Brown took down Benitez 3 times but Brown could not capitalize it.
 It ended in round 3 with a choke on the neck.

Henry Briones vs Guido Cannetti
It's very exciting. Both guys traded kicks and punches continuously from the beginning till the end. Henry was smaller in built. Even though he attacked much more than Guido did but Henry was not strong enough to defeat Guido.

Edgar Garcia vs Hector Urbina
Its exciting. It ended in round 1 when Urbina forced Edgar to tap out with a lock on the neck.

Dennis Bermudez vs Ricardo Lamas
Both fighters continously exchanged fists and kicks from the beginning till the end. It ended  quickly in round 1 with a choke on the neck.

Jake Ellenberger vs Kelvin Gastelum
It also ended  quickly in round 1. The guy who took down his opponent lost due to a choke on his neck! It's surprising and exciting.

Theres only one excellent fight in UFC 179 and its worth 4 stars

Jose Aldo vs Chad Mendes
Its very intense and exciting fight. Both sides attacked from the beginning till the end. This fight made this show worth 4 stars.

Diego Ferreira vs Beneil Dariush
The first 2 rounds were boring. The last round was better but it could not save the whole fight.

Lucas Martin vs Darren Elkins
Its boring and unimpressive. Its a stand up fight for the whole 3 rounds.

Fabio Maldonado vs Hans Stringer
Its boring. Nobody had clear advantage until the end of round 3.

Glover Texeira vs Phil Davis
Its a lukewarm fight. Phil was stronger and his take down techniques were superior but he could not capitalize on it.",1432598400,,2431,4.451467268623025
