8460485,3,B0057CON8Q,"I give it 2.5 stars actually, but that's not possible so I put 3. With regard to content, it's primo but getting it to play and then controlling moving through the videos is difficult and annoying.
TABs are accurate and instructor plays it well; however, without any verbal comments except in the Intro to the lesson which is fine since what he's doing with his hands is clear and self-explanatory.
I had a heck of a time getting this DVD to play. I have Windows 10 and uninstalled the new minimalized Windows DVD player. I tried to get the DVD to play in Windows Media player to no avail - the videos are .VOB files and after searching for the Internet for hours, I could not find any codec to plug WMP in order to play. Eventually I decided to download a freeware, VLC media player (not the one in the Windows store but from the actual website). I'd have rather not had to resort to freeware or additional codecs but it is what it is. Once I got VLC up, I was able to view the videos, but I was only able to ""manually"" advance the video in the Intro to each song's lesson. For ""Player's View with TAB"", Wide View with TAB"" and ""Player's View with Pick-Hand (and fretboard fingering) Close-Up"" you click start and that's it. If you click stop half way thru and want to get back to the point you were at half way thru, you have to sit there and wait til it plays all the way to that point. Maybe it's me, but I haven't figured any other way.",1443225600,,1441,4.22463768115942

8460488,5,B0057CON8Q,"You cannot beat the play along series. Great tabs and sheet music and add the DVD it is a great teacher. Some of the Hal Leonard books come with a DVD with tutorial of the songs. Whichever product you choose, you cannot go wrong with Hal Leonard.",1423612800,,246,4.25531914893617
8460489,1,B0057CON8Q,"doesn't show that much, just get to watch some guy play the song. needs to be in more depth.  waste of money",1381708800,,108,3.909090909090909
8460490,4,B0057CON8Q,"This is an excellent book for those wanting to learn some Floyd songs! The tab is accurate for those, like myself, that don't read music. The CDs are nice as well, providing a ""cover"" version of the song and a version with the guitar track removed so you can practice. I prefer the Alfred Publishing Ultimate series as you can loop sections of the music so you can get it down and slow down the track without changing the pitch! You can also change the key. Pretty nifty!",1359331200,,471,4.363636363636363
