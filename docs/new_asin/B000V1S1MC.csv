2928477,5,B000V1S1MC,"For those of you who are not familiar with the plot of this 35 year old pair of films, imagine the Monty Python group writing a satire of a John le Carre movie.

Technically the quality is first rate.  The 16:9 presentation is visually and audio flawless.  The first film has French audio and British English subtitles.

The second film has the additional interesting feature for amateur cultural anthropologists that the dubbed in audio is American English and the subtitles are British English.  The contrast between these two fully illustrates the saying ""Two peoples separated by a common language.""",1212883200,7,603,5.05050505050505
2928478,5,B000V1S1MC,"Tom Hanks did a popular remake of this movie called ""The Man With One Red Shoe.""  But believe me, it doesn't compare to this.  The original is definitely best and the ""Return of the Tall Blond Man"" is a great companion to the original.  The only tricky part is navigating the setup on your DVD player.  This is a Russian DVD which must be setup for the original French language with English Subtitles.  It sounds intimidating, but as long as you don't lose the directions which are enclosed, it is actually quite easy.  The directions, though a little long, are very easy to follow and this movie is definitely worth a little effort.  In case you are worried about the DVD quality of a foreign DVD, let me assure you that the actual DVD quality is excellent and I have no problems playing it on my either of my DVD players.  I received the items quickly, they were well packaged, and like I said... the vendor included directions which were clear and easy to follow.  Order these DVD's, make some popcorn, and have a great evening!",1202601600,19,1031,4.5

8216188,5,B000V1S1MC,"First time this movie was seen was with my BF, never knew that he could laugh so much.  It is a delight, and anytime a friend is depressed or needs cheering, out comes this movie, with the as-usual delightful Richard Pierre.",1389744000,,224,4.463414634146342
8216189,4,B000V1S1MC,"These two films, made in 1972 and 1974 have been unavailable on DVD and the previous tape reissues were murky and cropped. This release features beautiful picture quality, full enhanced 1.85:1 aspect ratio and excellent mono sound. The only departure from perfection is somewhat jerky motion on pans and fast movement, probably due to conversion from a European PAL master to the U.S. NTSC standard.
This is a Russian release, so the menus could be daunting but the vendor includes a simple instruction sheet showing which menu selection is which, and there is no problem with starting the movie. In any case, the display function in the DVD player will show which subtitles and sound tracks are which.
""Tall Blond Man"" has the original French soundtrack and English subtitles, while the sequel adds a dubbed English sound track as well. Playing the sequel with the English track and English subtitles is a real hoot because the two translations from the French are vastly different.
The first film was remade as ""The Man with One Red Shoe,"" starring Tom Hanks, falling far short of the original.
Both films are superb comedies, not to be missed. Highly recommended.",1387152000,,1166,4.954081632653061
8216190,5,B000V1S1MC,It was in French with English subtitles and was the movie I remembered! To finish I must write seven more words.,1368316800,,112,4.380952380952381
8216191,5,B000V1S1MC,No problems with this set.  Received promptly with the instructions for setup for French with English subtitles.  Probably could have figured it out without.  Nice to finally have the Tall Blond with great video and audio quality replacing a sad old tape of a long ago PBS station broadcast.  The short Russian language advertisement before the main menu adds a bit of humor.,1350432000,,375,4.904761904761905
8216192,5,B000V1S1MC,"Well, now I have an opportunity to learn Russian. The seller included a translation page to be able to select the ""correct"" vocal and/or subtitles languages. Worked like a charm. Excellent movie, but you probably already know that ;-)",1340064000,,234,5.0256410256410255
8216193,4,B000V1S1MC,"Director Yves Robert (who cameos as a conductor) and co-writer Francis Veber's The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe is built around a simple idea: that any innocent man seen at close range looks inherently suspicious. In this case the man is Pierre Richard's weak-willed concert violinist who unwittingly finds himself used by Jean Rochefort's secret service chief to distract ambitious rival Bernard Blier into revealing his own private spy network. Unfortunately the set up takes so long that the picture is in danger of turning into a genuine run of the mill spy thriller for the first half hour, but once it gets going and Richard is allowed to display his impressive talent for physical comedy, whether it be with a dropped cigarette or a flawless pratfall, and best friend Jean Carmet goes through an impressive display of numbed reactions to the mounting number of dead bodies no-one else ever seems to discover, it's not too hard to understand why it became one of the best loved French comedies both at home and abroad. Vladmir Cosma's infectiously enjoyable theme tune with Gheorghe Zamfir on the pan pipes doesn't hurt any either.

The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe cleverly reverses the premise of the original: rather than being an unwitting tool unaware he's supposed to be a spy drawn into a plot, this time Richard has to pretend to be a spy to get out of one as Rochefort finds himself alternately trying to kill him or protect him in the political fallout from the events in the previous film. In some ways it's a weaker film with a thinner and more obvious plot, but along the way it offers plenty of laughs built around Richard's ongoing obliviousness to the numerous failed attempts on his life and his own constant confusion over who is and who isn't in on his masquerade and Carmet's confusion over whether his friend is or isn't really a spy. Mireille Darc has a lot less to do this time - mainly be happy in the first half hour and turn up in another very low-cut dress in the finale - but things are a lot quicker to get started this time round.

While there's a fairly adequate UK DVD with both films, the remastered French widescreen PAL DVDs are a better bet, with a superior English subtitle translation and some decent extras with the main players that are unfortunately unsubtitled.",1284076800,2,2335,4.678832116788321
8216194,5,B000V1S1MC,"These are films I saw over 30 years ago and found very funny. It was a bit of a shock to find that the cover of the DVDs were printed in Russian! However with the instructions sheet inside the package I was able to see both films spoken in Franch with English subtitles. The films are still as funny as they were 30 years ago and the acting is superb as in most Franch comedies. They do a brilliant job of comedy. The first film is better then the second but are both well worth viewing. They are good enough to be able to view more than once. The 'hero' is a musician who is used without his being aware of it, as a supposed spy and the 'baddies' are trying to kill him. He is also having an affair with the wife of one of the other musicians in the orchestra and is taped while they are making love. The tape is heard by the husband who wants to kill him too. The rest is wonderful farce and hilarious.",1280188800,5,904,4.027777777777778
8216195,5,B000V1S1MC,"I bought the set from ""spstore"" through Amazon. I receiced the set 3 days after I placed the order in excellent condition. The Picture and sound are excellent. Setting the player for English subtitles was easy and intuitive. I played the Sequel with no subtitles, as it is dubbed in American English, which was done very well.
We first saw The Tall Blond... when it was released in the theaters with English subtitles. I remember we laughed so hard, we wished for breaks so we can come up for air. Now after all these years we still laughed hard.
There is an American remake of the film with an excellent cast, staring Tom Hanks called The Man with One Red Shoe. That film is very well done and funny, but the original is clearly better, even with subtitles. Pierre Richard is one of the all time comedy greats. It is hard to imagine anybody else doung a better job as The Tall Blond. I am happy to add the Set to my comedy collection.
Amazon also gets 5 stars for handling flawlessly the transaction.",1257638400,4,1001,4.445652173913044
8216196,5,B000V1S1MC,"If you see only one French movie in your life, make it this one.  The Tall Blond Man is rolling-in-the-aisles funny.  The sequel is also very funny, but not quite as funny.  Mind you, the sequel is funnier than many recent comedies from both sides of the Atlantic, but I can't think of a funnier movie than the original Tall Blond Man.",1255219200,4,335,4.370967741935484
