7413614,4,B014IB6NXO,"I bought this blu-ray out of the UK.  I was concerned about the whole ""might not work on certain players"" thing, but mine worked just fine.  As for the documentary itself, it's a good program for any Blackmore/Purple/Rainbow fan.  I gave it four stars because it was not as in depth as I would have liked. There are interview segments with Joe Lynn Turner, Graham Bonnet, and others, but not so much Deep Purple personnel.  The program definitely shows what an amazing guitar player he is.  This dvd (or Blu-ray) is certainly worth buying.",1449792000,,539,4.691489361702128
7413615,4,B014IB6NXO,Great DVD Great to see Ritchie so relaxed and open about his life and career. I just wish they could have had some new interviews with his former purple bandmates.,1449705600,,163,4.466666666666667
7413616,5,B014IB6NXO,"when I first heard about this so called dvd
the Ritchie blackmore story I immediately thought another Unauthorised Documentary about Rainbow, Deep purple etc
which is waste of watching and money
but then I found out the Documentary is being released by eagle vision which means it's an official Doco on Blackmore himself
I was going to buy the U.K. DVD version but the cost is to High
so I bought the Japanese dvd version which is much cheaper which is NTSC format anyway but region 2
the Documentary is pretty Good, it's about 90mins Doco
about Ritchie Blackmore himself, Ritchie and Candice are interviewed mainly throughout the Doco
Ritchie talks about his life when he was a boy and when he started playing Guitar
Ritchie talks about his first band and how Deep purple was formed, His relationship with Ian Gillan
he talks about Ian & roger leaving Deep Purple in 1973, talks about the Burn & stormbringer albums
talks about how Rainbow was formed, lots & lots more info is talked from Ritchie's point of view
other Guitarists, singers & Journalists are also interviewed about their personal view on Ritchie
like Queen Guitarist Brian may, Joe satriani, Steve Vai, Steve Lukather, David coverdale, Glenn Hughes
Lars Ulrich, Gene simmons, Steve morse, Graham Bonnet, Journalist Malcolm Dome and others
there's no new recorded interviews from any member of Deep purple
there's only 2 archive interviews of Jon Lord & Roger Glover looks like they were taken from the Machine head classic albums dvd

there are Bonus features, 40mins of extended interviews or outtakes which can be played together
the first 20mins of outtakes is more interview footage with Ritchie talking about more behind the scenes stories
of Deep purple & Rainbow
the rest of the outtakes is more footage of other Guitarists, singers & Journalists talking about Ritchie
very stupid idea to add the outtake interviews as bonus features, makes no sense
eagle vision should have just included all the interviews in 1 Doco so it would run for 130min total
but instead they decided to edit the Documentary and add the 40mins of outtakes as a bonus feature
this Japan edition has the exact same content the U.K. edition
the only difference is eagle vision have added a special bonus for the Japan edition
which was a surprise to me, few more detailed outtakes with Ritchie & Candice
Ritchie talks about Ian leaving deep purple in 1988 and then why he left deep purple in 1993 permanently
but your hear from Ritchies point of view of what happened, Candice helps with the interview
some stuff that has only been rumours for decades is now officially set right!
I'm Happy I bought this dvd, hasn't been a waste of money
the Japan edition has Japanese subtitles of course, there's subtitles off option in the menu
there's also the Japan live 1984 show and the 2 disc soundboard set that comes with it
you can get this in the Deluxe edition version which is 2 DVD'S + 2 CD Discs
or you can just buy the Japan show seperatly from amazon japan, your Decision
5 stars for this new dvd",1449446400,7,3043,4.741509433962264

7413619,1,B014IB6NXO,I cannot review  because I am fed up with the B.S. of this release.  When is this being released as original press kit with the documentary and 2 cd of Tokyo 84 Rainbow show that will have an official USA release.  Enough is enough.,1448409600,3,232,4.2272727272727275

8730840,5,B014IB6NXO,"I love Blackmore, Purple and Rainbow but would have liked more specifics on the different eras. Glazed over too much but on the whole great for fans.",1463961600,,149,4.555555555555555
8730841,4,B014IB6NXO,This documentary provided a rare look at a musician who is very private and rarely if ever does interviews. I recommend this for anyone who is a Deep Purple or Rainbow fan. The documentary provides the reasons why one of the best classic hard rock guitarist suddenly changed over night to a very different style of music. It shows a side of him that not many would ever think describes him.,1457827200,,390,4.507042253521127

8730845,3,B014IB6NXO,"There are some genuinely funny moments as should be expected from Ritchie as he shared some new stories for this documentary.  However, this DVD is hardly a celebration of his career because The Man in Black has been wasting away his talents ever since Ronnie quit Rainbow in disgust over the commercialized direction Ritchie desired.  Perfect Strangers was a welcome return to heavy rock, but the glorious reunion quickly soured.  It was amusing hearing Ritchie talk nonsense in the 80's about reincarnation.  Now, it's truly sad knowing that he's wasted away the past two decades pretending to be a minstrel from a past life and playing such tedious music.  His praise for complete and utter rubbish like Street of Dreams was painful to watch.",1454284800,3,745,4.975806451612903
8730846,5,B014IB6NXO,"Hello folks,

As a few of the reviewers have mentioned, there are many ways that this DVD could have been made, but something tells me that it was either this way, or no way at all ! It has a lot going for it, in the fact that it's a sit down, have a beer, & a quiet chat about old-times, with reflection of feelings in the present time. It's certainly from a personal perspective, & it is all from Ritchie's point-of-view. Most stones were turned-over, which I thought surprising, & an honest recollection of events present themselves, that in truth possibly should remain private, but being the general public, we want to know ! I say this with regards to his feeling towards Ian Gillan, & in truth, I thought it very unprofessional for him to leave Deep Purple in the middle of a successful world tour in 1993, & yet I gain an understanding that he'd reached his threshold of patience & snapped. The juicy bits I'll let you discover for yourselves LOL !

A lot of ground is covered, though it's certainly not like the great film ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"". A brief browse through the discography with comments from Ritchie & guests is covered, though not in any real great detail, probably since in Ritchie's eyes it's all been done before ! Not a lot is mentioned about his gear that he used throughout his life in a specific sense, but his guitars & amps do get a mention here & there.

His reflections about his peers & the industry etc are reasonably covered, & there's always a laugh or two along the way. So where there was once tension, now is just a passing thought with a smile, with reflective & thoughtful answers along the way from a quietly spoken Ritchie.

There are many remarkable scenes here, where many of Ritchie's peers reveal the great prowess & ability he has on the guitar, even before the days of the late, great, & dearly missed Jimi Hendrix. These are for you to enjoy & discover for yourself.

In summary, it's quite a fine way to spend a few hours in the company of one of the great guitarist & innovators of the last 50 years ! Time well sent & will be enjoyed !

Cheers,

Gregster",1450915200,3,2113,4.402564102564103
8730847,2,B014IB6NXO,Lot of rehatched stories of events from Ritchie's point of view. I was hoping this would be more detail into his playing or about how his style evolved into using the scalloped fretboard or more technical info. The second choice would have been greater detail into his career. Instead it's a history lesson from Ritchie's perspective in a kinder gentler time.,1450742400,,359,4.901639344262295
8730848,2,B014IB6NXO,"Wasted opportunity - could have been SO much more.

Should have been a 2-DVD (Disk 1 early 60's - 74, Disk 2 Rainbow till now), crammed full of unseen/rare videos, backstage clips, some unreleased music.

Expected to hear what it was like working with Joe Meek, doing sessions in mid-60's London in the same circles as Clapton/Beck/Page etc. Wanted to hear more, and get a real flavour for  that unique time in swingin' London.
The constant touring up and down the M1 in a Transit van... etc etc.

I wanted to know how he got so good, stories of him living with a stripper in Hamburg in 66/67 , doing shows and practicing 12 hours a day etc etc .

Feels like it was done on the cheap too.

Disappointed he still openly critisises Gillan. Not cool Ritchie - been too long - be the bigger person and let it go - no need to mention.

Ritchie and the producers should have watched 'The Story of The Eagles' to see how a good, well thought-out, well researched music documentary should be.

Was so looking forward to this....... Let's hope that whatever dvd's get put out as a result of the 2016 Rainbow shows are better.",1449792000,8,1116,4.409756097560976
