8071193,5,B000A0GPPE,"""Las Tres Pelonas"" takes place amid the chaos and violence of 1914 Mexico, where the villagers in the less populated areas were terrorized by army, bandits, gun runners, and rebels, and it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, because some of the bad guys had reasons to be bad, and some of the good guys were up to no good. But we have no doubts about rancher Chava (Antonio Aguilar, superb as always) and his friend Tranquilino (Daniel ""Chino"" Herrera, who blinks and twitches his way into our hearts).  These two are definitely good guys, but even they make mistakes and put the lives of loved ones at risk. The plot is hard to figure out the first (or even second) time one sees this film, but the songs are grand, and the horses grander. Aguilar's horse, Bailarin, is astounding...a noble, white stallion who dances and prances under Aguilar's command. Aguilar's horsemanship, subtle acting, and beautiful singing voice are what carry this film and make it extremely entertaining.

Directed by Rene Cardona, with lovely b&w cinematography by Victor Herrera, ""Las Tres Pelonas"" has 8 songs, and all of them are wonderful; I especially like the cancion huasteca, where we get to hear Aguilar's falsetto. The plot revolves around Chava's search for his kidnapped novia (the beautiful Rosenda Monteros) and his chance involvement with a revolutionary, Mendez (Rodolfo Landa), and a gun smuggler, La Gringa Luci (Martha Valdez). There is much humor along with a good deal of tragedy, and there are many scenes which are laugh out loud funny (a favorite is when Chava sings to the drunk comandante). There is also a marvelous mano a mano fight between Aguilar and Landa, and all in all, this is an action/drama/comedy film with great music, starring one of Mexico's finest singer/actors, and will be enjoyed by anyone who likes Mexican cinema.",1175558400,2,1854,4.882539682539683
