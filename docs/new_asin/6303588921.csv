7851045,5,6303588921,I have used these in my PreK and Kinder classes for years and love them!!  Each animal/insect segment is about 10 minutes....just right for our little attention spans.  I would love to have them on DVD and would love it if Sony would produce more videos of different animals.,1442188800,,275,4.591836734693878
7851046,5,6303588921,"This is a great video for young children. I show the ladybug section to my preschoolers when we learn about ladybugs. It is very age-appropriate, educational, and keeps the children's attention. The photography is well-done. Each insect section is around 10 minutes long, which is perfect for little ones.",1305331200,,305,5.244897959183674

My husband watched along with us.  I have to tell you, I learned a few things about insects myself.",1150761600,,258,4.270833333333333
