917472,2,6304707622,"Steven Seagal is a federal agent investigating the death of his fellow agent in a remote town. He disguised himself as a handy man, yes handy man with his pony tail and leather jacket. Sure he blends right in. It's not  his worst movie though, personally I think  his worst is ""The  Patriot"". I gave this DVD 2 stars because of its excellent sound  quality and good picture transfer.",964656000,3,383,4.507246376811594
917473,3,6304707622,"It's a good movie Seagal shows a more human side in this film. I purchased the movie because i'm a big Seagal fan and i ended up liking the film very much. I think this is one of his best because it allows him to show an  interest in something more than cracking heads. He shows a genuine interest  in helping these people with a sort of story that you don't normally see in  a Seagal film,an love interest. Seagal is never going to be given credit for  his action movies and he certainly won't be given any credit for this film  either but as an everyday person not a reviewer i think its a film worth  seeing or even buying.",921628800,2,626,4.132231404958677

917690,3,6304707622,"Hard To Kill is my favorite Steven Seagal movie. And then this is next.  He plays an EPA agent who is sent to Kentucky to investigate some toxic waste from abandoned mines being dumped into the water.  It has a bunch of country music stars like Randy Travis,Kris Kristofferson and Mark Collie.  Marg Helgenberger and Stephen Lang are good also.",1489795200,,344,4.7

917808,3,6304707622,"In my opinion, Fire Down Below is a 'different' kind of Seagal film; more depth, character development, slower paced, a 'country-film', but still with plenty of action; it is one of my personal Seagal favorites. Seagal composed most of the music; and the songs are very good and poignant. An underrated Seagal film and his last good movie: 3 stars.",1482192000,,348,4.816666666666666

While ""Out for Justice"" is just about the typical Seagal story, with a lot ""get even"" activities that feature the actor's considerable martial arts skills - ""to the max!"" it is still an enjoyable story line that supports the action sequences and the inevitable outcome.

The other two films are atypical of his films, in several ways.  The plots of ""Fire Down Below"" and ""On Deadly Ground"" are both linked to very modern problems: environmental pollution and corporate greed, which often are interrelated. Both of these films are also much more suited to younger audiences because of clearly toned-down violence.  There is also a good mix of humor and romance, and these films definitely portray a much more gentle Steven Seagal, who does lend them very well to a wider audience's enjoyment.",1383609600,,963,4.889570552147239

There is not as many crazy gun fights, strange violence or bad language scene's as in say exit wounds, but plenty of action and suspense.  Why it did not do well at the box office, I am not sure.  If only Seagal could bring some of his most recent movies to this or under siege 2 status, I think it would help his career.

919638,3,6304707622,"I find it strange that I have written reviews for martial arts flicks for a few years now and have never covered a film of Steven Seagal's.  Which would make sense if I couldn't stand him and/or hated his films.  Not the case at all.  Not only do I enjoy all of his early films and even the occasional Direct-To-Video release (e.g. ""Urban Justice"") but I credit his Aikido skills with saving fight choreography in American films of the late-80s and early-90s!  Before he came along I had little more to rent than a gaping-mouthed Van Damme utilizing slow-motion spin kicks that clearly missed dudes' faces by several inches.  Mr. Seagal offered fast and brutal fights with interesting character-portrayals that have long been a parody of themselves but were fresh and unique at one time.  I found myself rushing to the theater to catch any film of his from ""Marked for Death"" all the way through ""Glimmer Man"".  It seemed wise to avoid them after that.

A flick or two before my hasty retreat, he starred in ""Fire Down Below"", the story of an EPA agent investigating the illegal dumping of toxic waste into old coal mines in rural Kentucky.  He finds corruption at every turn but is always prepared.  While his character is scarcely different than any other he'd played by this time, he seems strangely at home here.  Showing a genuine care for the people he's been entrusted to help and a genuine dislike of the greedy scumbags willing to exploit them.  Add to the obligatory beatdowns a sweet, well-edited truck chase, a love interest (Marg Helgenberger, tv's ""C.S.I.""), and Seagal jamming with some Bluegrass musicians and there's a little something for everyone!

The fisticuffs are mostly good but it was around this time that the filming of Seagal's fights started to sour.  Not so much the editing but the use of ""wavy"" close-ups.  Compared to what passes as action in most modern cinema and Steven's contemporary flicks, there is really little to complain about in that department though they definitely could've been much better.

Interesting casting and I'm sure the party was a blast as long as Travis Tritt didn't perform again!  Kris Kristofferson, Levon Helm (as the good reverend), Randy Travis and other pickers and singers are on hand for the fun!  Not quite sure what Stephen Lang (""Tombstone"", ""Avatar"") is doing here but he is deliciously despicable.  Harry Dean Stanton is a born Kentuckian so that makes some sense.

I have no specifications to report as I watched this On Demand yesterday and do not own it though that will be changing soon.  I have seen this many times before and have always liked it okay but for some reason enjoyed it more with this viewing than previous ones.  I would recommend this to 80s & 90s action-junkies on the unlikely chance it hasn't yet been viewed.  If somehow, one has never seen a Steven Seagal movie, there are definitely worse (and hammier) ones to start with.  The best is ""Out for Justice"".

919639,4,6304707622,"This is more than just an action movie, and I will leave it to the Seagal experts to critique it on that.  But he whacks the bad guys in a most satisfying manner, and there are plenty of them to whack (usually more than once).  The real attraction is that Steven Seagal, who co-produced the movie, has an affinity for the subject and seems to be trying to tell the story of the Kentucky coal region in some fashion.  It may not be on the level of Harlan County War or Coal Miner's Daughter, but it gets the job done.  Speaking of the latter, Loretta Lynn's twin daughters Peggy and Patsy have brief appearances that are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.

There is some beautiful scenery too. You get to see Cumberland Falls in the opening sequence, and majestic vistas in the Cumberland Mountains region.  I liked the music fine, though there could have been some more authentic performances of the country/bluegrass type.  And his co-star Marg Helgenberger as Sarah Kellogg did a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.  The plot may have been a bit contrived, but this is a Hollywood action movie, and such illegal dumping does happen in some form or another.  All in all, it gets most things right, and I recommend it.",1316476800,,1232,4.5636363636363635

919641,5,6304707622,"Love him or hate him, Steven Seagal forces you to take sides and avoid indifference.  The plot of this movie forces you to do the same.

Yes...it can be preacher-like pertaining to the environment but what's wrong with that?  Watching this action/morality play where the good guy is in an uphill battle to bring attention to issues that we have developed a helpless apathy for or we are powerless to ""fight them back""; we are in fact as viewers, part of the church members depicted in the scene where Seagal as Jack Taggart makes his point about how money can bring out the absolute worst in people.

I think that there will come a time (this movie is now 14 years old) when Seagal's movies will be appreciated on a deeper level rather than the obvious and some would say gratuitous violence that is in each of his pictures.

I agree with others who have mentioned about the scenery and especially the MUSIC.  The soundtrack for this film is a disgrace.

Perhaps what many don't know is that many of the characters are actually country-western singers, along with The Band's Levon Helm.

Steven Seagal is a much smarter and intelligent man that most people give him credit for.  It's time for his movies to be recognized..........",1309046400,,1230,4.657407407407407
919642,5,6304707622,"When you speak of action, it becomes hard to finish a sentence without the name Seagal sprinkled in somewhere. Among all the action stars in rotation the human Panda bear reigns near the top year after year. Even if he whispers 93% of his lines you just can't help but double over with laughter and pure B delight. The man is 300 pounds of B action fury that can't be slowed down by any buffet line, no matter how tempting it may be. Seagal has a duty to tear it up on a regular basis for the good of America. Despite his current films seeing a big decline in the fan department, we stay committed and feel honored to watch a flick from his heyday. No matter what has been said about Fire Down Below, this baby is a 5 star event all the way. There is more action, ponytail grease, and hicks then most could handle.

In typical fashion Seagal plays an EPA agent named Jack Taggart looking for some answers. Turns out his friend was murdered on a hunting trip in Kentucky, whats wrong with you I tell you he dead, and Seagal feels the need to spring into action. Naturally the hicks are threatened by his mind altering sex appeal and immediately want him dead. In fact in one part one hick calls him a ""pretty boy"", something we're sure nobody has ever uttered about Seagal before. Despite the rednecks many death attempts Seagal naturally stops each one in it's tracks. He displays his patent Seagal style a** kicking all while wearing a colorful leather trench coat. This may be the only jacket that rivals Santa's 4x Packer leather ...actually it humps it into submission. As always Steven winds up the victor leaving a bloody trail of beat down hillbillies in his rear view mirror.

Fire down below aka With a Shave down below was something of epic proportions. It had the perfect amount of classic Seagal mixed in with more then a hand full of backwoods yokels. This combination goes down as smooth as a post chuck rice crispy treat dunked into a 20 oz hazelnut  This guy knows what I'm talking about. It's a true mystery that more Seagal films didn't take place in the South, after seeing the movie glory found after this masterpiece was released. There nothing better then a ponytailed city boy going down south and wreaking major havoc.

It has drama, a softer story with the local towns people / the Kentucky setting / and the woman he courts.  Regarding the woman in the movie - I forget her name but she is really stunning in her own way.  It doesn't end with tradegy [he starts a committment to her] like a lot of movies - and he also gets some ""conversion"" to right thinking among the towns folk.  Almost a family flick with some heat to it.

Anyway, the movie was a typical Steven Seagal (not Marg) film in that he's the likable hero, fighting despicable villains who were easy to hate, and every action scene is Rambo-like in which Seagal never misses injuring his foes.

One big difference in this film from his earlier efforts: an emphasis an aesthetic cinematography. This had some beautiful rural scenes of Kentucky and in particular, a church on a top of a hill, in which a number of scenes take place. Not only is the country scenery nice but there are some good country songs in here and better yet - blues guitar music in the background throughout the movie. All of this was different for a Seagal film.

Of course, the nice scenery was probably due to the fact Seagal played an Environmental Protection Agent (""Jack Taggart"").

Also different was the fact that Helgenberger (""Sarah Kellogg"") was not the typical gorgeous young sexpot normally paraded out in these martial arts films, but was rather plain with, as mentioned, no makeup. She wore conservative clothing and showed no skin.  Then again, Appalachia being the setting for this story, her dress and manner was appropriate and realistic.

Language-wise, most of the hard profanity comes from Kris Kristofferson's villain character, ""Orrin Hammer, Sr.,"" in the first hour. How they treated ""religion"" in this film was bizarre. Good, bad, good, bad - like watching a tennis match.

Overall, the story is interesting and pure Seagal nonsense....but entertaining. I still like the blues guitar and the Kentucky scenery the best.",1234396800,,1693,4.943661971830986

There are many conflicts in this powerful film: Government agency (the EPA, in this case) against a huge corporation. One heroic man against an array of thugs & one very powerful man pulling all the strings. Father versus son. Brother versus sister. Contaminated water versus clean drinking water. Corrupt government officials versus honest ones. A church divided. A small Eastern Kentucky town versus a very powerful corporation. Trust versus betrayal! Love versus hate! Fear versus courage! This film covers just about every aspect of American society, possible!

Besides an incredibly well written story, great acting and terrific cinematography, Fire Down Below also teaches us how to be courageous! Sure, most of us don't have the fighting skills of Steven Seagal, but his most dangerous weapons are his intelligence and his passion to stop evil in its tracks. Something we all can strive to do in our own lives!

919733,4,6304707622,"By the time ""Fire Down Below"" rolled around, it was all too clear that things had taken a turn for the worse with ol' Steven Seagal. His days as an A-lister were almost completely behind him, and the only awards his films were considered for were the dishonorable Razzis. Our favorite wrist-snapping aikido master was in the doldrums - stuck between his best work and his short-lived comeback, and just barely making back the budgets of his offerings. Nevertheless, critical response to his movies never matched my feelings, and for what it's worth, I think ""Fire Down Below"" is a pretty fine vehicle.

For all non-canonical purposes, the movie is a spiritual successor to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>. Seagal is Jack Taggart, an EPA agent dispatched to ascertain what's causing the toxic epidemic that's swept a small Kentucky town owned by a wealthy millionaire (Kris Kristofferson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-trilogy/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade trilogy</a>) and operated by his son (Brad Hunt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cookers/dp/B000A8AWUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cookers</a>) and the local posse. After fending off several attacks by the proprietors' goons and getting affectionately involved with the town's beautiful outcast (Marg Helgenberger,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-Crime-Scene-Investigation/dp/B00008972G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</a>), Taggart realizes that the sicknesses arising around the town are not the result of some environmental accident, but of something purposely ruthless and dangerous...

The film wants a little for action, containing only about three brawls, one car chase, and two big shoot-outs. Admittedly, the rig chase is done very well and one of the fights (a six-on-one affair) features Seagal wielding a wooden staff with pleasing skill, but the amount of remaining film that is given up as thriller-material is a bit too lengthy for my taste. Then again, Seagal has very little reason to fight, for the movie has probably the easiest-to-defeat villains that Steven has ever crossed paths with: never once do you get the impression that he's in legitimate trouble, because apparently the multi-millionaire baddie can't afford to hire anyone other than clueless goofballs to do his dirty work for him.

Surprisingly enough, when it comes to acting, this is one of Seagal's better outings. No, he's not exploring different characters or broadening his range of emotions, but for a change, his persona is actually pretty likable. His relationship with the townspeople and especially with the misjudged woman allows him to show a soft side that he isn't usually quick to expose. While the latter relationship does seem a tiny bit forced, he does give the overall impression of being a gentle giant who really does care about those his job entitles him to interact with, and for once, his actions are fueled by generosity and personal duty rather than vengeance. His real-life environmentalist concerns are well-represented and probably had a lot to do with him pushing himself as an actor.

The supporting cast generally pulls its weight well, and the production values are solid, so the question to the view is whether one is willing to trade the rough & tumble Seagal for a friendly Seagal - a Seagal who would rather strum a guitar than shoot somebody in the face (which he eventually does, of course), or use a hammer to fix peoples' homes rather than crack peoples' skulls. For myself, the transition was actually pretty smooth and easy to accept...but regardless of whether or not you enjoy the film, chances are that you'll be ready to pop in a more characteristic bloodbath of his by the time John Prine starts crooning for the credits.",1217203200,5,4014,5.891752577319588
919816,4,6304707622,"After the weak entry in ""The Glimmer Man"" Stevie decided to redeem himself by somewhat recreating ""On Deadly Ground"" Unlike that movie, Segal plays Jack Taggart, an agent of the Environmental Protection Agency; and like ""On Deadly Ground"" Segal has a thing for protecting people from rich industrialist, that only have one thing in mind...to make more money.  Taggart arrives in a small town in Kentucky, he posses as a carpenter, interested only in fixing peoples porches and houses. But as we all know Segal is undercover and is ready for some action. In this small town in eastern Kentucky, Someone is dumping toxic waste down the mountains...now that's a big no-no. Taggart begins to question people of the town, if they know of anyone that is involved with the dumping; no one of course can help because they are being watched, and even if they could they're too chicken....So you know what that means..That's right, Seagal is goanna have to save the day from cowards that cant stand up for themselves.

The plot of this movie is very similar to that of High Plains Drifter & Pale Rider, only modernized. We have the same mysterious character arriving into town, don't know much about him, and is interested in protecting the innocent. This movie, even though unoriginal in some areas, manages to be a solid action flick.  One of the things I disliked in this movie was the doubles for Seagal; this is the movie where we see the birth of Seagal's doubles. Many action scenes involving...Simply running they add a double replacing Seagal...WTF? but that's nothing compared to the doubles Segal would later have in his DTV releases. Anyhow this is worth owning if you're a Seagal fan, I recommend buying the special 4 film favorite edition from Warner Bros; it includes 4 of Segal's Best movies,  It comes out cheaper that way.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5",1217116800,,1863,4.788161993769471
919817,4,6304707622,"Released in 1997, ""Fire Down Below"" stars Steven Seagal as an EPA agent who goes undercover in SE Kentucky to investigate the evil deeds of a corporate mogul played by Kris Kristofferson & his minions, which includes dumping toxic waste in abandoned mines and murder. Seagal masquerades as a do-gooder helping people with his carpentry skills and living at a local church, but mogul's cronies are on to him and try to chase him away.

The plot kinda reminds me of Clint Eastwood's 1985 ""Pale Rider"" (which borrowed heavily from ""Shane""). A lone stranger comes into town and befriends the common folks, saving them from the evil tycoon and his motley crew. The difference is that ""Fire Down Below"" is an Eastern rather than a Western and it takes place in modern times. Seagal may not have the supernatural overtones of Clint in ""Pale Rider"" but his heroics are so fantastical he comes off a bit supernatural just the same.

Seagal, of course, is a highly likable protagonist. He's ultra-confident, cool and soft-spoken at all times; and he knows how to kick some serious arse. Numerous times throughout the film he takes on multiple attackers and wins without even breaking a sweat. Unbelievable? Yes, but Seagal makes it believable. He is, after all, 6'4"", dressed in cool black threads and a master of all kinds of martial arts.

Some say Seagal's a bad actor, but this isn't true. If someone is giving a bad acting performance you can tell because there's an awkward air to their delivery and you don't buy them in the role. This is not the case with Steven. Never for a second does the viewer question Seagal as the protagonist. It may be the only character Seagal can play, but he does it well.

Plus Seagal has numerous great one-liners throughout the film. For instance, late in the film he confronts his EPA colleague who has sold out to Kristofferson and says, ""You're a piece of s*** and I'm ashamed of you."" The line is perfect and perfectly delivered, not to mention so true-to-life. Hasn't anyone ever betrayed you, abused you or disappointed you to the point where you finally give up with the realization that they're just a shameless and shameful piece of s***?

One of the best highlights for me is the gorgeous Appalachian locations and cinematography. The picture was filmed on location in SE Kentucky -- Hazzard, Mt. Vernon and points between to be exact. I feel Appalachia is largely under-utilized in filmmaking and greatly enjoy it when films take advantage of this magnificent area of the USA.

Seagal's romantic interest is played by Marge Halgenberger, who became popular a few years after this film starring in TV's CSI. She's very believable as the local infamous woman who has a strange relationship with her brother, played by Stephen Lang.

Another highlight is the blues/country music heard throughout the picture. It turns out that Seagal wrote or co-wrote many of the songs featured and even performs one on camera. I never even knew he was a musician! There's even a country-ish Jimi Hendrix song. Plus a couple Country stars make cameos, like Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt.

FINAl ANALYSIS: ""Fire Down Below"" falters a bit in the final act but, other than that, I love this film. It has everything you'd expect in a film that takes place in hillbilly country -- good family folks, rednecks, poverty, coal mines, brawls, alcohol, pot farms, backcountry churches, incest and country music. The best feature for me is the genuine Appalachian locations and photography. Add likable Steven Seagal to the mix and you have a winner!

As another reviewer has stated, Seagal has a totally winning personality -- a hero with a heart of purest gold. He's certainly someone worth emulating in my book. In fact, in this film he represents all (or most) of the qualities of authentic manhood missing in our current society that celebrates effeminized and weak men (another good example would be Clint Walker in 1966' ""Night of the Grizzly"").

Lastly, I should warn action fans that this is hardly an all-out action film. Yes, there are action pieces interspersed throughout, but they flash by with a few blinks of an eye. ""Fire Down Below"" is a drama/action/thriller wherein the story plays out fairly leisurely, but with bursts of great violence.

Although ""Under Siege"" is technically a better film and arguably Seagal's all-time best picture, I personally favor ""Fire Down Below"" for the reasons cited above.

The film runs 105 minutes.

He transforms and becomes ecologically minded and commences a whooping on the evil Michael Caine and his greasy henchmen. It is one of my favorites with exceptional scenery and music. In ""Fire Down Below"" he is one bad EPA agent trying to find evidence on the mad Kris Kristopherson and his Kentucky cronies for poisoning the water supply with leaking cyanide barrels in a mine. And finally in ""Out for Justice"" he is a cop friendly with the local Brooklyn wise guys and he wants vengeance when his partner is killed by a whacked out William Forsythe and his gang.

In 'Fire Down Below,' he is an outsider posing as a church sponsored carpenter while he works for the Environmental Protection Agency to stop a greedy coal baron from dumping extremely large quantities of toxic wastes in abandoned coal mines... Those dangerous chemicals could destroy the drinking water for thousands of miles and kill a bunch of people around the hills... Seagal gallantly promised not to leave the small town until the poison from the air, the streams and the earth is taken out...

Many thugs (with snakes, sticks, guns, and big trucks) are hired by the uncaring mining magnate to get rid of our action hero but Seagal remains virtually untouched...

'Fire Down Below' highlights new environmental message but fails to come up with the expectations... First, Seagal's amorous interest with the sad country woman seems artificial, used in the film to grant the 'new visitor' easy access to statements he might need... Second, the motion picture lacks the best villain whose prowess could equals Seagal's... Steven's character never really faces much of a challenge...

No, its not as good as Under Siege, someone says thats his best, probably right. But movies like Hard to Kill and Marked for Death are probably similiar league to this, are entertaining popcorn shows.

Surprised to see the comment about leather jackets and hot weather, I also picked up that the area was cold part of the year, wasn't there even some snow visible in some scenes? I mean it might be South of Mason Dixon,

 but it wasn't Florida.

His son the wimpy would-be thug i also thought was effective.

the name of great old Depression-era song about US coal-mines and poverty which runs in final credits, mentions 'Mr Peabody"" the US colliery  family---

Most of those buck-toothed, barefoot hillbillies wouldn't even notice.

But I digress, The Lord goes undercover as, get this, a freaking carpenter to smoke out these so-called evildoers.  Seagal fixes at least fifty hillbilly's porches throughout the movie.

What happened to Seagal?  Instead of sticking to what he did best, he freed himself from Warner Bros. in order to focus on more character driven films with a positive message.  Once again we find him trying to save the environment as he plays Jack  Taggart, some kind of environmental agent with a shadowy past who comes to Kentucky to investigate toxic dumping by business mogul Kris Kristofferson.
Seagal also parades around the steamy hot Kentucky landscape clad in massive leather coats to hide the fact that he's enormous.  In one scene, he sports a black leather coat with pink and yellow stripes.  Nuff said.  It's not clear if Seagal is having fun or if he's trying to do something new or what.  One thing is clear: he's fat, and that's just a no-no for an action star.
The point of a Seagal film is to watch him beat the crap out of idiots dumb enough to think they can take him on.  However, once again this film is lacking severely in that department.  Further embarrassing himself, Seagal resorts to awful jump cuts and fast motion in order to pull off stunts he used to handle with ease back in the slimmer days of the early 90s.  Once again, his money move is the shot to the crotch, including one creative bit where he kicks someone's leg so hard that it forces the guy to kick another hapless stooge where it counts.  Ouch.  He displays ridiculous marksmanship.  He runs out of an exploding mine, not evoking images of Indiana Jones outrunning a boulder but rather a fat man chasing a Big Mac.  He even has a, choke, gasp, romantic subplot involving a mentally disturbed mountain woman played by cutie Marg Helgenberger.
As if testing audiences, this film introduced us fully to the Seagal country music angle that has mystified me more than all of his Zen mumbo jumbo over the years.  He plucks a guitar with glee, he sings and plays on half the soundtrack.  Then he busts out lines about soothing ointments to help the villain through those tough times in prison with his new cellmate.  We even get Harry Dean Stanton as the village idiot.  What is going on here?
At the time, this was Seagal's worst film, in my opinion.  However, he has gone beyond the call of duty with later efforts such as Half Past Dead and his personal nadir, Ticker.  Seagal actually snapped out of his cheesecake stupor long enough to make Exit Wounds in 2001 (where a trimmer, ponytail less Steve returned to bankability). However, he tore that all up with the aforementioned turkeys and is now stuck in a straight to DVD limbo along with that other action has-been, Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Once again, Seagal shows us that polluting is bad through his portrayal of an EPA agent who is ready to maim a corporate executive and his minions.  Scenes that have no real importance to the movie include Seagal remembering his deceased friend at the beginning of the movie and Seagal accidentally coming across some angry farmers and their marijuana field.  To his credit, Steven did write and perform one of the songs on the soundtrack for the movie, which acts as added comedy.  I guess if I was pressed to give someone a reason to see Fire Down Below, it would be because there are a few cameo appearances by some famous country music stars, but I don't know who they are because I'm not into that kind of thing.",1054166400,,918,4.408284023668639
920020,5,6304707622,"A typical action, martial arts, explosive-packed Steven Seagal film about an environmental crusader from the EPA who takes on sleazeball toxic waste dumpers who don't care if every state south of the Mason-Dixon line gets cancer.
There are the usual fight scenes, where Seagal is outnumbered, or outmatched in terms of physical size. Yet he typically emergest triumphat after some really neat martial arts moves.
The casting director could have picked a much better female for the ""love interest"" part of the plot; someone a little more prettier would have kept the movie from dragging at parts. Seagal's wife-to-be (by the end of the film)is tired looking, backward, and helpless. I am serious when I say that the love interest is a typical Cinderella theme; knight and shining armour rescues a helpless maiden who, in this case, is imprisoned by an incestuous brother.
The best part of the film is when Seagal meets the Chief Sleazeball, played by a grimey Kris Kristofferson in a casino. The best lines in the film are between Kris and Seagal discussing the former's impending jail sentence. Kristofferson makes mention that he is 61 years old, but Seagal assures him that he will make sure that he will be taken care of by a nice big and, presumably dark, fellow inmate, the implication being that Kris will soon be not just an inmate, but a ""wife."" I've seen this movie a half-a-dozen times and I still laugh like hell at this part.
Seagal's movies are typically made to show off his martial arts prowess, his smart-ass, wisecracking way of confronting evil, which can be defined as anything that gets in his way, as well as some pretty dramatic pyrotechnics that would make any ten year old boy shout ""Wow man, is that cooooool!!!!!!!!!!"" Neither he, nor the filmakers many any greater claims. If you are looking for something deeper, turn to your local PBS channel whenever they air ""Jane Eire"" or ""Pride and Prejudice.""
Fire Down Below has a half-way decent plot, some reasonably good acting (with the exception of the homely, and somnolent female lead) and some fantastic special effects.
Definately not a ""date movie"" nor a ""chick-flick.""",1045353600,2,2148,4.903846153846154
920021,4,6304707622,"It would seem that there seems to be a pattern developing here.  I think Segal might be an environmentalist.  Although I couldn't agree more with the posistion his movies seem to take on the care of our environment, I am not sure this is the route Segal's movie career should be taking if he wants to continue to enjoy success.  For the reson that this type of movie and Segal seem to be getting repetitive I have only rated this film a 4 star production.
The acting and cast were excellent, and the story line dealt with something that could be going on in today's society, but I truly hope not.",1044489600,,596,4.351351351351352

920023,5,6304707622,"Steven Seagal is an undercover agent and goes to deliverance town. There he fixes residents' houses, porches, etc. He attends their weekly church services and falls in love with the local farm girl. Adoration! Even though life may seem fine and dandy, a coporate man is dumping toxic waste on their land. Local boys start trouble with Seagal and tell him to leave. Oh, Seagal doesn't even move an inch and they try to beat him up. Using some wood, Seagal cracked some skulls and was flawless. Another attempt to get rid of Seagal came when a huge big rig tried to drive Seagal off of the road, but no! The truck drove off a cliff instead and it was disastrous. Seagal cursed in church and it shocked everybody. He had to, to open up everyone's eyes. All of them were in danger, but Seagal saved them anyway. Irritable! Seagal sang songs, laughed and came back for the woman he loved after causing a scene in a small casino. Such lordage shouldn't be taken accounted for.",1023408000,3,970,4.517045454545454
920024,3,6304707622,"There is hardly any action in this movie. And for a Steven Seagal movie such a crime is, quite frankly, unforgivable. Although he does try to stretch his range and attempt a little bit of light love scenes with Marg Helgenberger's character.

Something I find rather unrealistic about this film is the fact that Seagal walks around, in the sweaty hicktowns of Appalachia, in a large leather jacket that is fully fastened all the way up. Not only would anyone in real life melt in such a garment it would also severely limit their physical dexterity.

The plot is basically identical to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>. Some balony about Seagal not liking Kris Kristopherson (doing the same role as Michael Cane) dumping nuclear waste in old mines...but hey it has to be dumped somewhere and dump this movie with it. For hardcore Seagal fans only.

The DVD is in pretty cool Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.78:1 instead of the theatrical 1.85:1.",1022284800,9,1080,5.533333333333333

920026,3,6304707622,"In many ways Fire Down Below is a thematic remake/sequel to Seagal's self-directed On Deadly Ground.  EPA Agent Jack Taggert (Seagal) goes undercover in Kentucky to investigate rumors of illegal waste dumping there.  Much carnage follows.  Seagal does not seem to be in particularly good shape in this outting, fancy edits and trick photography straining to create the illusion of the fast moves he had made in previous movies.  Nonetheless it is entertaining viewing if you don't put too much thought behind it.  Kris Kristofferson makes for a comically aloof/smug bad guy, too bad there wasn't more of him in the movie.  Final word?  It's good bad fun.",1007251200,,654,5.0
