103302,4,0790733927,"I've always liked this movie and at Amazon.com's price on this I had to get it on DVD...Seeing it for the first time on Widescreen was great, sound was good (as most DVD's are - not the best, but good considering when it  was made)...If you haven't seen this movie before and like Pacino's other  films then don't miss this - he is incredible in this one!",949622400,,355,4.2835820895522385
103303,5,0790733927,"I would have to agree with everyone in here that this is one of Pacino's best films.  I think that an idea for a bank robbery film is excellent.  Also to my surprise this movie was based on a true story and that kind of  surprised me a tiny bit because I thought to myself ""how could anyone  have lasted that long in a bank"".  Another good part to this movie was  Sonny's (Pacino) intellegence through the movie for example the part where  they were about to sound the alarm and he stopped them that was amazing and  the way he was able to keep making deals with the police so he could have  what he wanted.  I thought that was fabulous.  The only better Pacino movie  that I have seen than this would have to be Godfather part 1.",944956800,3,730,4.135714285714286
103304,5,0790733927,The realism of Al Pacino role in Dog Day Afternoon is almost 3-D like.  You actually feel that you are bank with the hostages or outside with crowding cheering for Sonny.  Setting in the summertime makes excitement  more tense and thrilling.,930528000,,241,4.829268292682927
103305,1,0790733927,I think this is only a 1 time thing and an accident.,1511308800,,52,3.4166666666666665
103306,5,0790733927,"I did not think the world of DOG DAY AFTERNOON when it premiered in 1975, but since it currently rates 8.0 at the IMDb, perhaps I should have caught on sooner.  It has mesmerizing performances by Al Pacino, John Cazale, Chris Sarandon and others, and the genuine feel for a hot sweaty summer afternoon in New York, right down to the trash on the streets and our knowledge that the Big Apple was floating general-obligation bonds just to pay salaries, which led directly to the city's bankruptcy the following year.  There are nice comic touches, too, perhaps unintentional, which this gritty movie needs, such as the fact that this Warner Bros. production has Warner Bros. cartoons like the Road Runner playing on the TV in the bank.  If you haven't seen it before, please do so, as it's one of director Sidney Lumet's hallmark movies -- but my advice is to devote a full evening to it and keep little kids away.",1509235200,2,912,4.617283950617284
103307,5,0790733927,Its a great movie. I recommend,1508112000,,30,4.166666666666667
103308,3,0790733927,"A slow paced film with probably one of the most famous lines in film history. Pacino is good, Cazale is brilliant as usual. It takes quite a while to get going though. I imagine the reveal of why Pacinos character robs the bank was a big deal (and possibly controversial) back in the day, but it seems quite dated now. Probably worth the watch just to see the Attica scene.",1507939200,,373,4.3428571428571425
103309,4,0790733927,"Movie 1 of 1975 and 22 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

Serpico was so bad in my eyes and so heralded by so many that I thought that Picino was probably over rated through the years. Part of what makes a great screen actor to me is the roles they choose. While they can't always know if a movie will be great they can make calls about the script. So I at least hold them somewhat accountable for what I see. With all that in mind I have to say that I think Picino really hit the ball out of the park with ""Dog Day Afternoon."" he was compelling to watch and made me join the crowd of Brooklynites that were cheering Sonny on. Before seeing this the movie had everything going against it. If you had said the story was about a bank robbery gone wrong I would have thought it sounded boring. If you had said it was a character study I would have asked where the story was. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is so much larger than just a story or character study, it's both but it's more brilliant than that. It's the details of a fascinating character who's life and personal history bleed out through the Robbery and the stress it causes. Well, apparently Sonny caused this kind of stress all the time in all of the people he loved. I also loved how Lumet (the director) didn't mind letting you be confused. Perhaps he wanted it to hit you the way it hit him when he first experienced the true story. It certainly would have had its confusing moments. A brave choice to allow us to be in the dark and to trust him to explore these elements at his own pace.
There was a point to the story as well. You get the feeling that this bank Robbery means a lot to all of us as it explores homosexuality, police brutality, gender reassignment, celebrating criminals as heros, media narratives and more. Gravitas is the word that comes to mind. It is also perpetually relevant. So satisfying to do this retrospective and be treated with such a great piece of art. The thougts it engendered to me were about man's corrupt nature. How even the necessary and good things,  such as law enforcement,  can be subject to corruption and frailty. At one point there is a conversation where Sal, a bank robber, advocates for bodily purity and is called out for hypocrisy as he holds up a bank while doing so. Ironically he also eagerly wanted suicide as an option to oppose law enforcement. These scenes seemed to make comments about the whole movie not just the individual scenes. There was a song to start the film but no more music throughout. I'm not sure if that was the correct decision but it made the ending impactful and very powerful. One area where I think Lumet made a poor choice was to cut off the relationship between the police chief and Sonny abruptly to jolt us into the third act and to present the FBI as a disruptive force. While that impulse was probably right in many ways it left us with no payoff for a lot of time given to Sonny and the chief. I would have at least liked to have seen an argument between the chief and the FBI about Sonny's fate or something along those lines. It was indeed effective to do it the way Lumet chose but we lost something in the process. The movie deserves no less than five stars which is why I'm giving it four. Why? Well, because I'm not grading on a curve. I'm reviewing this as a member of a later generation who has been exposed to many copies and rip offs. ""Die Hard"" comes to mind (the relationship between the two main characters is very similar despite some major differences). These later films affected my overall enjoyment of ""Dog Day Afternoon."" It's not fair but it's a brute fact.
Pros
-suspenseful
-important
-honest
-great characters
-Picino is brilliant
-Lumet at the top of his game
-re-watchability
Cons
- although through no fault of its own it has been ripped off and that did deplete my enjoyment.
-no payoff for a lot of screen time devoted to Sonny and the police chief.

I can't decide if this was better than ""The Sting."" I think it's a more important film, and I think it's a smarter movie but both are great in their own way.",1506816000,,4095,4.3700787401574805

103319,3,0790733927,This is based on a true story.  Three men are going to rob a bank.  But one of them backs out at the last minute.  That should have been an ome for the other two.  This was a smash for Al Pacino who earned an Oscar nomination.  I don't know who he was up against.  But he probably should have won.  He wants the money for his male lover to get a sex change.  Who could make this stuff up.  The movie is probably best remember for Pacino's rantings on the sidewalk outside the bank.  When the news and their camera's were showing all this taking place on live t.v.  This is the kind of movie that you probably don't want to watch very often.

three near mental cases rob a bank. as it turns out they want the money to pay for a sex change operation for another man who is in a mental ward. one of the robbers loses his nerve early on and runs off.

the police reaction makes a circus of what is going on.

The movie was undoubtedly shocking in its day, and it goes for realism, with a lot of talking involving various people. But we ended up fast forwarding through much of the movie. Why?

103492,5,0790733927,"Al Pacino starred in four films prior to this film namely: The Panic In The Needle Park,The Godfather,Serpico and The Godfather Part II. Apparently,it was in his fourth starring picture,Dog Day Afternoon is where he got his real confidence on-screen. It was in this picture that cemented his place in Hollywood for the next forty years as one of the greatest actors not only in his generation but of the industry by playing the role of Sonny Wortzik,a complex bisexual bank robber in this film.

Dog Day Afternoon is a film inspired by P.F. Kluge's article that tells a story of the robbery of a Brooklyn bank by John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile in 1972. It chronicles a unique bank robbery on a hot summer afternoon in New York City. Shortly before closing time, scheming loser Sonny and his slow-witted buddy, Sal,played by excellently John Cazale,burst into a Brooklyn bank for what should be a run-of-the-mill robbery, but everything goes wrong, beginning with the fact that there is almost no money in the bank. The situation swiftly escalates, as Sonny and Sal take hostages; enough cops to police the tristate area surround the bank; a large Sonny-sympathetic crowd gathers to watch; the media arrive to complete the circus; and police captain Moretti,portrayed by Charles Durning,tries to negotiate with Sonny while keeping the volatile spectacle under control. When Sonny's lover, Leon that was portrayed by Chris Sarandon, tries to talk Sonny out of the bank, we learn the robbery's motive: to finance Leon's sex-change operation. Sonny demands a plane to escape, but the end is near once menacingly cool FBI agent Sheldon arrives to take over the negotiations.

The movie had great performances. That is true especially from Pacino,who showed intense acting and complex emotions as Sonny. He showed varied emotions as a bumbling first time bank robber,a loving bisexual who showed concerned to both his wife and his lover,an intelligent strategist and most of all,a hysterical human being. He definitely portrayed his role as realistically as possible that an Oscar nomination was only deserving. The same is true with Sarandon,who garnered also an Academy Award nomination for their portrayal in the film. Aside from that,Lumet's excellent and outstanding direction was just worth of the mention.

Aside from the performances,the themes touched by the movie was also in cohesion and were never out of place inspite of its variety such as homosexuality,a bank robbery media circus,people wanting to be shown live on TV,family and sex transplant. The screenplay by Frank Pierson was able to put everything together in one marvelous story that he truly deserves of an Oscar for that movie.

Dog Day Afternoon just deserves its place as one of the best films not only in the decade it was released but of all-time just as Pacino cemented his place as one of the best actors in history.",1416960000,,2898,5.056485355648536

103522,4,0790733927,"To watch a film like 1975s Dog Day Afternoon is to understand why Al Pacino is considered one of the greats.  Granted, by this point, Pacino had already starred in the first two Godfather films, but he was still a young enough actor with an obviously bright future.  As Sonny Wortzik in Sidney Lumets Dog Day Afternoon, Pacino effortlessly displays how a great plan can go topsy-turvy in the subtlest of ways, leading to the first day of the rest of his life when it was supposed to be a quick, in-and-out bank heist.

Wortzik and his accomplice, Sal (John Cazale) end up becoming media sensations after Sonny shouts his Attica protests in light of the recent Attica prison riots, riling up the crowd and inadvertently earning their cheers.  One has to wonder, however, why the women who are holed up in the bank as hostages aren't more scared.  Is it because Sonny looks like he just doesnt have his act together, even if Sal is training a gun on them the whole time?

The only one who seems to act normal under these circumstances is poor Howard Calvin (John Marriott), the security guard with an asthma attack who Sonny lets go free, only for the poor guy to be apprehended by the cops when they think that he is the surrendering robber.  Calvin can barely talk and barely breathe, he gets himself so worked up, yet the ladies keep themselves occupied with learning gun tricks and partaking in idle conversation.  Really?  Hens will be hens, I guess.

The twist of the film, which has been discussed countless times in the decades since its release, is that Wortzik is robbing the bank so that he can pay for his wifes sex-change operation.  Wortziks wife, Leon Shermer, is played by the oh-so-versatile Chris Sarandon, and Susan Peretz plays Angie, Wortziks estranged divorced wife and the mother of his children.

Unless I overlooked it, its not mentioned in the film that Sonny is divorced, so it was a head-scratcher trying to figure out why polygamy would be allowed in Brooklyn, especially since they make sure to mention that Wortzik and Leons marriage was conducted in a church and therefore official.  Thanks be to Wikipedia for clearing that one up.

Dog Day Afternoon was actually based on real events.  John Wojtowicz, together with Sal Naturale, held up a Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn in August of 1972.  (In the film, the bank is the fictional First Brooklyn Savings Bank.)

After being convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison (serving six in the end), Wojtowicz wrote a letter to the New York Times attempting to clear up some of the inaccuracies that he felt existed in the film, saying that the content was only 30 percent true.  However, he praised Pacino and Sarandon for their accurate representations of himself and his wife, Elizabeth Eden.  Sadly, Eden (born Ernest Aron) succumbed to AIDS complications and passed away in 1987.  Wojtowicz died of cancer in 2006.

Interestingly, Wojtowicz was inspired in his plans for the heist by scenes in the film The Godfather, which he watched earlier that day.  Considering Pacino and Cazale had starred in The Godfather as well, it would be interesting to know whether or not their previous roles had any bearing on them starring in Dog Day Afternoon.",1406505600,,3233,4.766606822262118

This is a master class in acting.  He easily makes you feel the raw emotion and desperation of this character.

John Cazale, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon are all phenomenal as well.  The scene with Sonny and Leon talking on the phone is just tremedous.  You can see and feel all of emotions that exists between those two characters in one 5 minute phone call...love, hate, anger, fear.

103555,5,0790733927,"Can you remember the way things used to be?  Dog Day Afternoon will take you back. This film is a classic mid 70s bank robbery disaster classic.
If you are an Al Pacino fan, you should know about this one. A prime Pacino spearheaded this film and it stands up to some of his best.
It also still stands up today as an important movie that makes a number of statements about life & media influence.
Dog Day Afternoon walks a wonderfully thin line between comedy & seriousness. Very few films successfully pull this off.
You want to laugh but you're never quite sure what exactly is going to happen next. Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) & his friend Sal (John Cazale) decide it's a good idea to rob a bank.
This is the first bad decision they make of many. From the very start of the film it all goes downhill. There is really no plan, no money, and ultimately no hope.
It's the pure skill of Al Pacino that keeps you engaged until the very bitter end.
Overall this is a very good film. All the characters are human beings, flawed, and relatable. The human nature of the film shines through. Also characteristic of 70s cinema, the media is a clustered force to be reckoned with.  By the end of the movie you are left wondering, who is the real danger? The media? The police force? The crowd of on lookers? The clueless bank robbers?  Dog Day Afternoon is a brave film that tackled tough subjects in a unique way. Watch this movie.

103561,5,0790733927,"Filmed on a relatively small budget when director Sydney Lumet was at the top of his game, this is one of the best films of the mid-1970's, well deserving of its 6 Oscar nominations and other awards. It's a reasonably accurate portrayal of an actual NYC bank robbery gone awry in 1972 adhering to the basic facts and sequence of events. Finer details were fabricated to fill in what could not be gleaned from interviews and official documentation of the crime and police actions. When compared to the photos and TV coverage of the actual robbery in progress, Pacino was the perfect fit for the role, and not just in appearance.

The Blu-ray transfer is very good and clean. Film grain shows some as the film was shot in 35mm Technicolor, but it's not objectionable and maintains a high level of detail that would be lost trying to eliminate the grain. Contrast is very good as well as black levels. Don't expect the high fidelity audio found on current films as the original was the typical monaural soundtrack found on lower budget films of its era. There's only so much to work with in creating the Dolby Digital track for the Blu-ray.

Footnote about the Attica chanting for those too young to remember it:
The ""Attica"" chant refers to the 1971 Attica New York State Prison riot that lasted four days and resulted in 39 deaths, 10 guards and 29 inmates. 9 of the 10 guards were killed by ""friendly fire"" from New York State Police, prison guards and New York National Guardsman used an excessive amount of firepower for an inordinate period of time, firing blindly and indiscriminately into clouds of tear gas to retake the prison. The official report(s) in the aftermath were blistering regarding the prison's overcrowding to twice its capacity, the all-white guard staff with rampant racism and prisoner treatment including systematic beatings setting the stage for a riot, the manner in which the prison was retaken with utter disregard for the hostages and prisoners not participating in the riots resulting in many unnecessary deaths and serious injuries, and brutal retaliation by corrections officers over a period of days after the riot was over. In summary, Attica was an example of how NOT to operate a prison and then, how NOT to put down a prison riot, and after that what NOT to do after the riot is quelled. The ensuing lawsuits cost New York about $20 Million in settlements.",1379116800,,2393,4.777777777777778

Based on true events, this film follows rather closely what happened one hot august afternoon when Our lead characters, Sonny(Al Pacino) and his partner Sal(John Cazale) attempt a bank robbery to help finance a sex change operation for Sonny's Boyfriend Leon(Chris Sarandon- brother of Susan Sarandon). The heist goes bad leaving Sonny and Sal inside the bank, and a hundred cops outside of the bank at a standoff. What happens next is terrific, electrifying, and hilarious as Sonny turns the whole situation into a near circus side show. Sonny leaves Sal to handle the Hostages as he steps outside the front door of the bank and negotiates with Detective Sgt. Eugene Moretti(Charles Durning)to try and find a way out of what seems to be an impossible situation. Charles Durning turns in an incredible performance and Al Pacino delivers an Oscar nominated, pitch perfect performance as the hysterically funny lead bank robber. A side note also is that this is certainly John Cazale's(The Godfather, Deer Hunter) finest performance before his untimely death just 2 years later.

The robbery immediately goes bad when one of the gang loses his nerve and Sonny has to let him flee. Then they learn they've arrived after the daily cash pickup and there's only $1,100 left. Sonny then takes the traveller's cheques, but attempting to prevent them from being traced by burning the register attracts attention from the smoke escaping outside the building. Police quickly arrive and surround the building, but make the mistake of letting Sonny know they're there instead of waiting for Sonny and his accomplice to go outside.

The robbery now becomes a dangerous hostage situation, primarily because of Sonny's half-wit accomplice. Turns out that Sonny arranged the robbery to fund a sex-change operation for his homosexual wife. Eventually they're all (including hostages) taken to the airport to board a demanded jet for Algeria - .

Sonny is apprehended, sentenced to 20 years, and served six. The real-life robber was given 1%+ of the film's net for the rights, and he gave that to pay for his homosexual wifes sex change. She (Elizabeth Eden) died of AIDS in 1987, he of cancer in 2006.",1356048000,,1337,4.964285714285714

103665,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" has aged well.  It puts us into its millieu, it puts us in touch with its characters, and like John Ford it does not call attention to its direction. (With the exception of its use of sound effects to do the work of a music track--and that's just fine).  This is 1970s colors and despite the thought that when it was releasted, Lumet was criticized for a lack of sense of place within its frame (in contrast to Hitchcock who carefully gives the audience a geography lesson), we are in the place with the characters. Even as we know they are actors, we come to believe their reality.  Lumet reflects the unique nature of NYC and Brooklyn in a time and place when the fact that a bank robber was ""gay"" was not just a freak event, but an anthem shouting gay people cannot be steroetyped. A bank robber could be masculine, an hostage taker and gay.  At a time when the New York Times avoided the word ""gay,"" on radio a homosexual was a reality check. Gay people exist, all over. Viva the lifestyle!

Notice how well Lumet keeps the set getting dingy over time.  It is nice, as is the lighting which goes from flourescent harshness to cold night.

Almost 50 years after Stonewall, almost 40 years after its release, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" brings us deftly back and presents a narrative more compelling than it seemed wehn first released.",1346889600,3,1349,4.504098360655738

I noticed things in the outdoor scenes (signs of surrounding businesses, for example) that I never noticed before.  Speaking in general, the overall level of detail is far superior to the DVD version.

Something I've noticed as my BD collection increases are continuity errors I never noticed before.  I watched this BD just last night and noticed one for the first time (I won't bore you with details - an outdoor daytime scene where the sun's shadow moves dramatically - one or more hours of real time had passed, demonstrating that pieces of multiple takes were used in the final movie).

I understand that it received six Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture. Well, It's that kind of movie. Strangely, the movie was billed as a comedy and I didn't see it at all that way. The people in it were inept and committed all kinds of  awkward blunders, but I'd say it was a very realistic presentation and by no means a comedy.

The movie involved three inept bank robbers, ultimately two, who attempted a stickup of a bank in Brooklyn late on a summer afternoon at closing time. Nothing went right. Among other things, most of the money had already been removed earlier in the day. Then the police showed up and ultimately a force of 250 cops and even the FBI  swarmed into the neighborhood. Naturally, a crowd of thousands gathered and cheered the proceedings. The whole thing turned into a complete fiasco and media circus with  the robbers demanding a jet trip to Algeria in return for a half-dozen hostages they held in the bank. That unrealistic escape plan was thwarted at the airport.

The acting in this movie was sensationally good. Both the cops and the robbers were inept, but it was done is such a way as to be ultra realistic. I felt as if I was actually there and a functioning part of the story. Al Pacino came across as a likable robber and his partner, John Cazale, was about as creepy as you could get. All of the remaining cast should get some type of medal for their excellence. The film moved along at an appropriate pace without a trace of boredom emerging. This was just a well done film!

103671,5,0790733927,"Dog Day Afternoon (1975)
Crime, Drama, 125 minutes
Directed by Sidney Lumet
Starring Al Pacino, John Cazale and Charles Durning

Al Pacino is one of the best actors of his generation and has given us many memorable characters, from Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy to his Oscar-winning portrayal of Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman. But if I had to pick my favorite character, it would be Sonny Wortzik. So, as the snow falls in Ontario, I decided to escape to the dog days of Brooklyn in the 1970s.

Pacino's performance was so full of energy. He switched from ranting like maniac to moments of quiet reflection. He appeared dangerous when required, but showed that he cared about the plight of his hostages a moment later. In fact, most of his hostages ended up rooting for him to succeed in his attempt to rob their bank. Heist movies are something I enjoy when they are executed well, and this would top my list. What's interesting is the reason Sonny attempts the robbery at all, but I won't reveal that here. It was certainly controversial back in 1975.

Sidney Lumet was responsible for the first entry on this list; 12 Angry Men. With Dog Day Afternoon, he showed us how the media was capable of turning criminals into celebrities. With his sidekick watching the hostages, Sonny ventured into the streets and performed for the gathering crowd. You'll probably find that you want Sonny to escape too because Lumet does such a good job of showing us his character and motivations. Isn't it strange how we sometimes root for the criminal?

Lance Henriksen makes an appearance toward the end of the movie and it helped launch his career. The resolution might not be what all that we were hoping for, but the movie was based on a true story. I remember watching Dog Day Afternoon in my early teens, and my taste in movies was very different from what it is today. But something about the story held my attention even then.

One thing I learned is never attempt a robbery with a partner who thinks Wyoming is a country.",1330473600,,2029,4.625
103692,5,0790733927,"Dog Day Afternoon ranks as one of Al Pacino's best films. This often-overlooked gem from the early 1970's tells of a bank robbery gone terribly bad when one of the robbers takes of leaving his two cohorts alone to rob a Brooklyn bank. Loosely based on a true story (and as the motive for theft unravels we find that truth really is stranger than fiction)this film provides comic relief interspersed with pathos. Pacino excels in this physically daunting roll of Sonny - the viewer loses track of whom to sympathize with. A ""must see"" from the true golden age of film - the 1970's.",1321228800,,580,4.586538461538462
103693,5,0790733927,"Dog Day afternoon is one of those films that define 70's films. That was a great decade for Pacino. With the exception of Brando, I can't think of an actor putting together 4 great iconic films in a single decade as Pacino did with Serpico, Godfathers 1 and 2, and this film.

Dog Day follows the events that took place in a bungled Brooklyn bank robbery in 1975. On that day, a couple of unemployed losers became celebrities on live television. The film shows how easily one can go from being a schmuck to a god by pandering to the people. As Sonny, Pacino used one word to go from an armed criminal to a superstar: Attica. Pacino's performance is very tense in this film in that it's not a glamorous performance. He looks and sounds scared, frantic, and desperate as you'd expect anybody to be in that situation.

This isn't what I'd consider a good-looking film as far as it looking like a Hollywood film. It has that same grainy real-world look to it as a film like the French Connection or even On The Waterfront. This film was about the actors themselves. A lot of close up shots of their faces and eyes. Charles Durning was excellent in here as the police lieutenant involved in most of the negotiations with Pacino and his parter, Sal, played by the late great John Cazale who played Freddie in the Godfather films. Other great roles in this film include the FBI man (Mulvaney), and a very young Lance Henrickson who played Bishop in the Alien films.

This film runs a little over 2 hours but there's so much going on that you'll hardly notice the time. A great example of 70's filmmaking and of what made Pacino the star he is today.",1319414400,,1642,4.4485049833887045
103694,3,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the true story of Sonny and Sal, two first-time bank robbers whose failed hold-up suddenly becomes a massive media event and hostage situation. These men, both veterans of the Vietnam War and open homosexuals (though not extrafilially involved), must face a war zone of life-threatening obstacles in their spontaneous decision to flee the country. Fantastic, yes, but excellent acting by Al Pacino, Charles Durning, and James Broderick makes this narrative startlingly real. Accessible to the average viewer, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" will find particular interest to ex-convicts, bank tellers, and all seeking a military burial.",1314230400,,646,5.6020408163265305
103695,5,0790733927,"The intensity of the film is incredible. No special effects needed and shot on a shoestring budget. This is a prime example of a great film,sadly underrated and overshadowed by 'Cuckcuckoo's Nest' that year of the anti-hero flicks,1975. What makes this double dvd great is the documentary itself. Al Pacino,Chris Saradin,and the late genius Sydney Lumet discuss the various ideas and observations about the film. Lumet would later win his laurels with the film 'Network',yet 'Dog Day Afternoon' is his true magnum opus. What makes this a great film? Great actors,great supporting actors,great script,great director,great writing,great ad libs,and a bizzare great story. Everything about this film clicked,at the right time. It's wonderful magic to see the chemistry between Al Pacino and John Cazale. In the 'Godfather' films,Al's role of Michael Corleone,he is rationale and sharp. The role of Sonny Wortzik,Al plays him as a gonzo loose cannon. And John Cazale,sadly his life cut short by cancer,plays another brillant performance,of a vunerable character trying to assert himself. I still love this film. Al Pacino was perfect for this film. Perhaps Dustin Hoffman could have played the 'Sonny Wortzik' role. Film historians will see the genius of this film,largely because of the synergy between the very different character parts. I'm so glad Al choose to go along with the film project. It's a raw classic that still keeps the audience hostage.",1304380800,2,1450,5.336244541484716

103697,5,0790733927,"Dog Day Afternoon is a real classic that asks some difficult questions about the roles celebrity, money and responsibility play in our everyday lives. Al Pacino puts so much into his portrayal of Sonny, the stressed-out intellectual pressed a few steps over the edge, that it's no surprise he nearly suffered a nervous breakdown on set. It's genuinely amazing how much quality characterization the filmmakers were able to fit into this regular-sized package, and not just for the lead parts. By the time Sonny, Sal and their hostages are ready to leave the confines of the bank behind, we know more intimate details about every one of them (and, perhaps, ourselves as a society) than we ever could've guessed going in. Throwing out the script and using largely improvised dialog was a key decision, and transforms a film that could have easily become a thin piece of exploitation into something much more vivid and real. It does slow down quite a bit just before the climax, but in the grand scheme that only adds more drama to the rapid-fire conclusion.",1300147200,,1054,4.861111111111111

The great Al Pacino portrays Sonny Wortzik, a bank robber who with the aid of a seemingly quiet accomplice, played by the late, great John Cazale, takes over a small bank in Brooklyn on a very hot day in August 1972. What should have been a simple theft turns into a huge, out of control media circus when the police, the news media, as well as the local residents enter the fray. This movie examines the lengths people will go to to make a stand for what they believe in, the drastic things some individuals do for themselves and others,  as well as the nuttiness of the ""15 minutes of fame"" phenomenon so prevalent in our mixed up culture. First rate performances, a great script, wonderful use of the NY inner city landscape, and incredible direction by Sidney Lumet make this a 70s gem.",1285113600,,985,4.628571428571429

Now, I've fortunately seen Pacino on stage back in the '90's in David Mamet's ""American Buffalo"" and he performed with so much intensity that I was over-awed. I think very few of his film performances have that intensity that his stage performances have had but this one shortly is the closest we'll get to Pacino, the stage animal. Watching this film again in a brilliant HD DVD transfer, is like watching a stage play. Director Sidney Lumet was at his best capturing the chaos of New York City life and the supporting cast is phenomenal:  Charles Durning, Lance Hendrickson, the late James Broderick and John Cazale, nearly matching Pacino in intensity as his co-hort (of course, he also played his brother but this role certainly showed his versatility) in crime.  It's a pity that he died so young from bone cancer (The Deer Hunter being his last film)but this film proven why he was so reverred in the acting world.  It's a sad fact that Pacino could not top this performance or others in that period (And Justice for All; Scarecrow) with minor efforts like the execreable ""88 Minutes"" or ""Righteous Kill"" with DeNiro.  Perhaps it is just the dearth of good material that causes great actors like Pacino to periodically return to the stage, his first love.  So do check this one out for his off beat performance (180 degrees different from ""The Godfather"").",1255910400,,1567,4.763837638376383
103731,5,0790733927,"One of the best films from the 1970's along with ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Taxi Driver"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was nominated for 5 Oscars inlcuding nods for Best Picture of 1975 and Best Actor for Al Pacino. Pacino plays a bank robber who holds a bank hostage one sweltering August day in Brooklyn in order to steal money so his gay lover can have a sex-change operation. Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of directing and bringing out the best from his cast. The title comes from the fact that August is referred to as a ""dog day"" month where the weather in New England can be extremely hot, with the story taking place one afternoon. The movie is gritty, daring, fast-paced, and involving, and although Pacino plays a villin you actually start to feel sorry for his motivations and the fact that he would go to these kind of extremes to fulfill his boyfriend's happiness. James Broderick and Charles Durning turn out memorable performances as the police officers who try to reason with the Pacino character outside the bank.

I love all Jack Nickolson work but honestly if you compare his work on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest against Dog day will agree with me that Al could have got the Academy. Pacino acting is far energetic, tough to do(in dog day context), brilliant, classic and what a amazing performance! It requires a lot of dare to do a subject like DOG DAY after becoming an Icon (after Godfather Hit). Many contemporaries had refused to work on this project. He turned down the ""over to do One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and worked on this movie. In short: Lumet (Direcor) has done great job, he knows how to deal with tense situations, Superb acting,Pacino in his splendor, Should have got 2 Oscar for this role. The pacing is extremely good. The issue of homosexuality was very well dealt with, not preaching in any way, understanding and considerate, everything was far better than any politically correct angle we may find in today's movies. This movie deals with common man problems. A man who is in middle of robbery still he is considerate.

He is as good as Pacino in this movie, and as important; from the moments of Cazales first lines there's always something kind of powerful and not what you're expecting.  The story itself is fun in a tragicomic kind of way and should hold your interest pretty well the full 2 hours.  Cinematography is great and I'd have to say this is the best Sydney Lumet film I've seen with the exception of ""Network"" maybe.

The 2-disc edition has lots of special features which make for interesting watching, with Pacino and Lumet talking about their work and the film in ""A 4-part Anniversary Documentary"" which you may be inspired to watch after seeing the film.

This was supposedly a true-life event which makes it all the more interesting. The only warning I would give parents is the profanity gets a little rough at times, especially with Charles Durning, the negotiating cop who uses the Lord's name in vain about every other sentence.

All the other characters were definitely interesting, especially Pacino's partner ""Sal"" (John Cazale). ""Sal"" doesn't have to say much; just the looks on his face say a lot. The story certainly is a memorable one and a big hit when it came out.

And so he outdoes himself once again in his best performance, which is the chronicle of a what-should-have-taken-ten-minutes bank robbery.

The movie is inspired by August 22nd 1972, the day two bank robbers had attempted to rob a bank. Sonny and Sal, two robbers, attempt to rob a bank in Manhattan, to get money for Sonny's lover's sex change operation. However, although all the employees agree not interfere with the robbery, it turns out there isn't much to steal, as most of the money has been picked up for the day. Things go from bad to worse when Sonny gets called by the police and is let know that every officer in New York is surrounding the bank.

Dog Day Afternoon is one of my all time favorite films- it is very simple, has very little violence in it and yet the performances are VERY real. Al Pacino gives his best performance here, and everyone definitely makes this film feel real for sure.

103783,5,0790733927,"In 1975 there was one film that completely swept the Oscars, winning awards for Picture, Screenplay, Director, Lead Actor and Lead Actress; a feat that has only been accomplished three times in the history of the Academy Awards.  That film has gone on to become on of the most highly lauded and respected films of all time, `One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest'.  While I am utterly astounded by each and every frame of that fantastic movie, I feel that it was the wrong film to take the sweep.  Instead, I would have cast my vote for Sidney Lumet's powerful `Dog Day Afternoon', for while it may not be as heavily rooted in deep meaning as `Cuckoo' it is an embracive and powerfully commanding film that, to me, was the best of the year.  I hate it when two films I adore (both would make my `Top 100 Films Ever Made' list) are released in this same year because it makes it so difficult for me to rally heavily behind one particular film.

If I had to choose a side though, this would be the side I would choose.

Lumet tells us the true story of Sonny Wortzik (whose real name is John Wojtowicz), who for apparently no reason at all decided to rob a bank in Brooklyn.  What was supposed to be quick and clean wound up being a long drawn out affair that captured the attention of the media and turned a few heads in the process.  The opening scenes set up the event, with Sonny and his partner Sal entering the bank, waiting for the lonely customer to leave and then taking the bank tellers and manager hostage for the loot.  When someone across the street sees the ruckus going on within the bank the police are contacted and what could have been a quick `in and out' type heist winds up being much more than expected.  With Police Detective Moretti breathing down Sonny's neck it appears that his options are slim, but as he devises his own plans of escape the film opens up and soon all is revealed.

`Dog Day Afternoon' is a brilliant film about desperation and last resorts, a film about the power of misguided passion and how one man can be pushed to his limit when he feels trapped or pressed into a corner.  Al Pacino brilliantly captures Sonny's state of mind, delivering what may very well be his finest performance ever.  Watching a film like `Dog Day Afternoon' tends to frustrate me, for it causes me to realize what a force Pacino used to be and then focus on what a eyesore he has become.

But eyesore he is not, at least not here.  His manipulation of the audience is beautifully controlled.  He glides through panic with ease and charisma and then nests firmly into defiance and a false sense of dominance as he believes he has a handle on the situation.  There is so much said with just the unease within his stare that it pains me to think he lost the Oscar.  I adore Nicholson and consider him the finer actor all around (Nicholson never lost it) but when I stack up the two performances from this given year I can't help but feel that this should have gone to Pacino, despite the fact that Nicholson was flawless (and comes in a very close second for me).

The rest of the cast is also brilliant, especially Charles Durning (who should have received the Oscar nomination over Chris Sarandon).  As the main detective on the case, Durning is a powerful presence, one of reason.  He floats through each scene with such confidence and maturity.  Chris Sarandon has a few strong scenes and adds a twist to the film (I know that his character has been spoiled by quite a few reviews here but I won't do it) and he manages to draw on audience sympathy (maybe that's why he was awarded with the Oscar nomination).  John Cazale is somewhat lost in this film for me.  He fades into the background (not unlike his `Godfather' character) when placed on the screen alongside the power that is Pacino.  He doesn't deliver a bad performance; he just is not as memorable as Durning or Allen.

Sidney Lumet directs `Dog Day Afternoon' with ferocious intensity, an intensity that matches Pacino's fearless (yes, I threw that word in there) performance perfectly.  `Dog Day Afternoon' never lets go of the audience but holds them at bay for its entirety and that is a magical thing.  It creates a feeling of paranoia as you struggle to figure out the next move, and it miraculously remains grounded when it could have easily gone awry.  I love films based on real life events because they help you to see that true life is often more engrossing, disturbing and downright mesmerizing than fiction.  `Dog Day Afternoon' is proof of that very statement.",1214438400,2,4549,4.4987834549878345

103788,5,0790733927,"This is the first time I have seen this movie.  Even though it was originally released in 1975.  Generally from the first moment of watching this masterpiece I was impressed.  The story is unassuming in today's action packed films.  Based on a true story of three bank robbers in August of 1972 in New York City.

Three men go into a small bank in an NYC neighborhood expecting their heist would go off perfectly.  From the minute they start the robbery things start to go wrong.  One of the partners decides that he doesn't want to have any part of it and takes off.  Then a whole string of events ruins their heist plans.

What made this movie so enjoyable was the humanity of the main robber Sonny(Al Pacino) and how they dealt with the quickly changing circumstances.  New York City in 1972 was like any American city at that time.  Filled with chaos and a changing world the movie reflects that.

After viewing this movie in Blu-ray I was incredibly impressed.  The stunning visual quality of this film definitely sets it apart.  This movie is the true vision of those who created it and now it can be seen in stunning detail.

This film is for anyone who wants to see a cinematic classic in beautiful HD.  The story and dialogue is very real and may not be a delight for those who like non-stop action.  For those who love good stories then Dog Day Afternoon should be on your must watch list.",1197331200,,1399,4.44488188976378

along with GODFATHER AND GODFATHER II gives us his best
performance as Sonny the lost man who only wants $$$ so
he can leave his wife and marry the MAN? He truly loves!
His male lover wants a sex/change and that operation is
very expensive.  What to do???  Sonny knows!  He will rob
a bank so he can get the $$$ for his lovers operation.
PROBLEM!  When Sonny robs the bank there is no money.
Also while in the bank he tells a bank teller to pick
up the phone just to have the call be for him. What's
funny is no one knows he is robbing this bank.  He takes
the call just to find out it is the police!  They are a cross
the street at that very moment.  What was suppose to be a 15min
bank robbery turns into a 5 hour mess. This movie is FANTASTIC
and shows why the 70's had some of our greatest films. For
lovers of Tarantino dialogue look no further than this film.
For the actors in this movie talk simultaneously stutter
their sentences interrupt one another what I mean is it
seems like real life and not a script!  I love Dog Day
Afternoon and was lucky to see this on the big screen
at a run down theatre in San Jose Ca.  The cool part of it
was I saw this in 1991 on the big screen not 75 when it came out
it was playing with two other movies the others being Jack
Nicholson's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST & Robert De Niro's
TAXI DRIVER what a triple bill it was! (though I fell asleep
at TAXI,hey I love that movie but it was late/early) You must
see Dog Day once in your life.  I have never met anyone who
has disliked it.  Michael Sarazen plays Al's lover and is hysterical
he won the Best Supporting Oscar that year.  Watch the world of
Sonny fall apart in just 5 hours you will laugh and you will
cry and most of all you will never forget it!

103812,4,0790733927,"I saw a bit of Dog Day Afternoon when I was about nine years old and left it this long before actually focusing on watching the whole film. Despite claiming to be the film expert that I am, I had little knowledge of what the film is actually about.

Sonny and Sal (that's Pacino and John Cazale) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it. But they simply couldn't be less prepared. One second into the robbery the third robber chickens out and runs away, leaving Sonny and Sal to do it on their own. The staff are jaded and cynical but politely put up with their bumbling and are only too happy to see the back of them. But the police surround the building at the last minute and a hostage situation suddenly arouses.

With nowhere to go Sonny can only make the usual demands but the media circus outside makes him a nationwide star and the crowds outside cheer for him whenever he makes an appearance at the doors. I guess that in the 70's (a decade I never witnessed) public morale was so low that a failed bank robber could actually be a kind of hero for even attempting to stick it to the man.

Based on a true story, the dialogue is mostly improvised, giving it a raw, realistic feel. Despite this, the script still won an Academy Award. A young Al Pacino seems to disappear and you end up seeing him only as Sonny. Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me. But I guess they thought that Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was more iconic/important/worthy or whatever. In fact, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest took almost all the Oscar's DDA was nominated for. Having never seen that film, I can't really judge if it deserved them. It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year. Man, 1975 sure was a good year for movies. Something that simply cannot be said for any year in the past decade.

One my favorite actors (Lance Henriksen, the man with the coolest voice in the world) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents. I never spotted him for a while (he's still quite young in this) and he has very little dialogue, but it still a pivotal role.

It's hard to define the genre that DDA fits into. On the one hand it's a hard-hitting real-life drama but on the other it's a satirical black comedy that's not without several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. Not a film for action junkies, I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else, but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never-ending career.

The HD DVD looks brilliant. Yes, you can tell the film was made in the seventies, but that's only because of the film stocks used. Aside from that, there's hardly a single trace of dirt or grain. It honestly looks perfect. The Dolby Digital+ sound design is about as good as it's going to be more a Mono-recorded dialogue-based movie however.

103816,5,0790733927,"The blackest of black comedy-dramas, DOG DAY AFTERNOON (1975) is the last of the great performances of Al Pacino's early career. These tour-de-force performances include THE GODFATHER, THE GODFATHER PART TWO (both of which co-starred his co-star here, John Cazale), and SERPICO. After DOG DAY AFTERNOON Pacino returned to the stage for a time.

This story of a bank robbery gone bizarrely wrong is based on a true 1972 occurrence in Brooklyn, New York. Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) convinces his friend Sal (Cazale) to help him rob a bank. The motive for the robbery is oddly altruistic, as it transpires that Sonny is a married, closeted gay man, also married to Leon (Chris Sarandon) who needs money for his sex reassignment surgery.

The actual robbery, which should have taken five minutes, stretches into a fourteen hour hostage standoff as the incompetent Sonny loses control of the environment in and around the bank and the incompetent police on the scene fail to assert control. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the crime scene soon becomes the preserve of the tabloid media and a participatory crowd of people in the street. Neither Sonny nor Sal qualify as particularly cold-blooded, and in fact, the hostages appear to be having a fairly good time, and become friendly with their captors, waving enthusiastically at the cameras and refusing to leave the bank when chances occur.

Besides being Pacino's early last hurrah, DOG DAY AFTERNOON is also the last in a long line of frankly antiestablishment films produced by the Hollywood mainstream in the late 1960s and early 1970s, films like BONNIE AND CLYDE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, LITTLE BIG MAN, and THE GRADUATE. The NYPD is presented as chaotic, disorganized, and bloodthirsty. Sonny and Sal become dark folk heroes as they win over the huge crowd of spectators. Sonny's leading the crowd in chanting, ""Attica! Attica!"" (Attica prison in Upstate New York was the site of a 1972 prison riot which was put down with a brutal loss of life) is considered one of the greatest moments in movie history.

Made at the nadir of American self-respect (the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate era), DOG DAY AFTERNOON doesn't excuse the crime it portrays, but it does raise some ethical questions by humanizing the perpetrators as antiheroes. Sonny turns his empty pockets inside out while addressing the crowd about his struggle to make a living; the cops are hooted and hissed continually; Sonny and Leon's relationship is portrayed as outrageous only by the media circus within the film, not by the filmmakers themselves (historically speaking, this early Seventies liberalism was about to go into societal eclipse just as DOG DAY AFTERNOON was released), and the only real violence in DOG DAY AFTERNOON is perpetrated by the authorities.

Throughout it all, Pacino shines as the emotionally conflicted, uncertain, overwhelmed, and desperate Sonny. Leading a cheering crowd one moment, he is frozen into immobility the next. In trying to cope with the helpless people around him, Sonny screams, shouts, sinks into despondency, and becomes grandiose by turns. He is shown as marginally effective only in relation to the utterly ineffective people in his life, people he seems to unerringly gravitate toward (including Sal, who becomes more and more befuddled as the film progresses, Angela, his wife, who becomes hysterical because she can't find a babysitter in the midst of this madness, and Leon, who criticizes Sonny self-indulgently over his negativity and fear of death, never considering that Sonny is facing a firing squad of hundreds on this brutally hot summer afternoon).

In so many ways, DOG DAY AFTERNOON is a summation of its time, an era of cynicism, failure, fear, distrust of authority, and economic, moral and ethical impoverishment, thirty years on not unlike our own.",1184457600,2,3838,5.1328

103819,5,0790733927,"Well, this is one of those films that I just loved from the moment I first saw it.  While I am too young(!) to have heard about the real events or to have seen the film in theaters, once I saw it, I was hooked!

I first saw this film either sometime in the mid to late 1990's or around 2000.  Channel 11 WPIX in NYC used to show it a lot.  It was Al Pacino so I was interested.  From the moment I saw this crazyiness and seriousness, I could not stop watching it.  This story is gripping and it is STILL very hard for me to believe that this was a indeed a TRUE story!

I won't go into the movie as this is not a movie review, but a Blu Ray review.  First, I always love films from the 70's as that was the best overall decade for movies, toys and music.  It was the worst for clothes and cars!  I had the SE DVD as well as the original and I expected not much of an improvement based upon 'professional' reviews on the net.  However, from the opening scene, it was 'clear' that this BD was miles ahead of the DVD and it was what we expect in HD.

It took me back to the days of the old New York that I used to know as a child.  To see the old tolls and buses were something.  Not really, but to see them in HD WAS something!  It was as if you had a time machine and jumped back in time!  This was not like watching an old movie and seeing an old movie, it was the closest thing next to being there.  Things no longer looked old, they looked real!

Hair shines like it was in front of you - each strand very clear!  Pastic bags look like pastic!  Loud 70's suits look a 'little' more respectable now that we can make out patterns and even materials used in the suits!  The old cars are easier to imagine them being the hottest things out since they are very clear like real life.  ANYTHING that is in the real world  looks real in HD.  Of course BD's look better than HD broadcasts.

My only gripe, which is what you would have to expect for the first couple of years of HD, it that the extras are not in HD.  They are the same as the DVD.  It should be in HD and we should never again see SD!  While they looked into the real story, they did not get deep at all.  They just showed how they came into knowledge of the story.  I had to dig very deep on the net just to find a little something.  It would have been nice to include some actual footage from the real event so that people like me can see just how wild a scene this was in real life.  I just can't imagine this being real.  If WB included as much of the real fottage in a Special Edition BD as possible, I would buy another one!

Finally, after watching this thing over and over, it finally hit me!  These guys WERE crazy and Sonny robbed the bank just to pay for a sex change for his gay lover!  I am not sure if the other two guys were in it for that, but that is all he wanted.  After serving his 7 years, he did pay for that sex change!  Now it makes sense why Charles Durning was talking to him the wat he was.  He knew he was sick!  See, I thought that it was their first bank heist and they were just nervous and new.  I did not realize that all of the non-sense that took place made no sense because they were crazy!

Great movie.  If you have never seen it, see it.  If HD is your first time seeing this, even better.  Nevermind the Godfather or Scarface, Pacino is a master of the art of acting in THIS film!",1182729600,4,3379,3.9116347569955816

103821,5,0790733927,"This Sidney Lumet classic is the third in the trio of classic Al Pacino movies I love dearly and never get tired of watching. The other two are ""Serpico"", (which was also directed by Lumet), and ""Scarface"".

One hot sunny August afternoon in 1972, three bumbling and inept robbers attempt to take the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. Things start to go wrong within the first ten minutes of them entering the bank and in no time at all, the cops are out front, the media is out front and a noisy crowd gathers out front for good measure. A robbery that should have taken no longer than 10 minutes turns into an all-night sideshow and the hottest thing on live TV.

Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, the leader of the two-man gang (there was a third man but he couldn't handle the pressure and scampered off less than five minutes into the raid) that needs the money for, among other things that are never made clear, Sonny's boyfriend (played by Chris Sarandon) who needs a sex change operation. Sonny and Sal (played by John Cazale) seem totally lost as their whole plan just seems to disintegrate around them. The action switches between the growing claustrophobia within the bank, where Sonny and Sal are holding bank employees hostage and the mayhem outside led by the corpulent and co-operative chief police negotiator, played by Charles Durning.

At times the movie is tense action thriller, at times comedy and at times pure farce. ""Attica! Attica!"" Sonny screams outside the bank at one point, alluding to an incident earlier that year at the infamous maximum-security prison where some prisoners had apparently been killed. The crowd goes wild, roaring their support for someone who has somehow become something of a local celebrity. At another point, Sonny asks to see his wife and kids. It's the boyfriend who's eventually brought by police escort. At another point we see gay activists waving banners of support. Brave people, considering this was New York City in 1972, just 3 years after Stonewall.

The movie earned six Oscar nominations in 1975 including Best Picture, Best Screenplay and one apiece for Al Pacino (his fourth) and Chris Sarandon. The movie is based on a magazine article by P. F. Kluge & Thomas Moore.

That day, August 22nd, 1972 will go down in history as one the 250 cops, the F.B.I., the 8 hostages and the 2,000 Brooklyn onlookers will never forget. You won't forget it either, once you've seen this unmissable Pacino classic.",1172707200,3,2454,4.819477434679335
103832,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a great film that wowed me the first time I saw it and continues to be a great film that I enjoy even after my 4th time watching it. We all know what a fine actor Al Pacino is; he usually gets the most raves for his performances in ""The Godfather"" and ""Scarface""

but I think that this film features the best Pacino performance. Nothing against Tony Montana, but Pacino's Sonny is such a great character that could've been played so many ways and Pacino does it just right. Sonny is naive, nervous, flamboyant, tough, and, occasionally, smart. The movie also happens to feature one of the most famous one-word lines of dialogue in cinema...""Attica!"" The movie is directed by Sidney Lumet, a fine director whose credits include 'Serpico,' 'Network,' '12 Angry Men,' and more recently 'Find Me Guilty.' DDA is, in my opinion, his masterpiece. An energetic thrill-ride that truly deserves to be ranked as one of the finest movies ever made. Sonny, his friend Sal (John Cazale, who was killed Pacino in ""The Godfather Pt. II""), and another accomplice barge into a small New York bank and try to rob it. It's established quickly how naive and unprepared the men are, especially after the third accomplice leaves right after the guns are revealed. Pretty soon, there's a phone call at the bank for Sonny and he realizes there are already police across the street. Within minutes, the scene becomes a media circus. Hundreds of cops, the FBI, the media, and onlookers have crowded around the bank leaving Sonny and Sal to hold the female bank tellers and the manager hostage. As Sonny desperately tries to get out of the jam and the cops slowly move in on him we, as the audience, realize...We're going to be in this bank for 124 minutes of film. I'm not fond of movies like this, movies that are set up almost as a stage play because it has only one setting. Oddly enough though, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is incredibly entertaining throughout. Now, I'm willing to bet, most of the detailed reviews on this site reveal why Sonny is actually robbing the bank. I, myself, knew this little tidbit before watching it the first time. Watching the film with a friend recently (a friend who had never heard of the film), when the not-so-big revelation came he was shocked and surprised. He basically has the same reaction the cops, the media, and the onlookers have. Having said that, I highly recommend that you try not to know Sonny's reason for robbing the bank before you watch this. If Al Pacino had not already made his name with other films, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" would have made him a star. He proves here (especially when you look at his other performances) what a complete and total actor this man is. Never for a second is Sonny not completely believable in every aspect of the word. It's not a one-man show and there is a lot of great supporting work here, especially by Cazale and a brief appearance by Chris Sarandon. I also think that I wouldn't be saying anything new or saying anything false when I say this very well could be the best, most unique, bank robbery movie ever made. Even the hostages aren't cardboard cliches. Have there ever been cooler bank robbery hostages in a movie? Do yourself a favor, as a lover of cinema, and see ""Dog Day Afternoon."" You will not be disappointed.

103836,5,0790733927,"This is a classic movie where everyone knows how it's going to end. (It's a true story, keeping fairly close to the facts.)

Unlike ""The Hindenburg"" for example, where all of the viewers know what's going to happen and Robert Wise is frankly unable to keep up their interest, here faced with the same dilemma Sidney Lummet (love the guy just for ""Verdict"" alone) is able to keep us glued to our seats.

This really is a random day, a bank robbery gone horribly wrong by one robber who doesn't want to hurt anybody (Sonny says 'I'm a Catholic; I wouldn't to that') and another who wants to kill all the hostages and throw them out one by one, on a hot, muggy, sunny day in Brooklyn.

Good solid cast, John Cazale as 'Sal' the demented killer and Charles Durning (I just realized oddly enough he was also in Hindenburg) and the brilliant Al Pacino as his rocket began to soar.

Two points. If you watch Pacino you see every move of everyman. No stiffness. Nothing is wooden. He can't get the carbine out of the flower box he snuck in the bank with so he shakes it, with each shake getting more and more frustrated. He storms past the tellers' cages knocking over a chair, taking two steps before he realizes he knocked it over. Then in the same scene, two minutes later, he walks over and picks up the chair.

The second thing is Brooklyn. Hot. Sweaty. Colorful. Multi racial. Smelly. Probably the last city of diverse races practicing cross-cultural communication on a (often) friendly, day by day style. This is all before the arrival of PC. Boy. Thank God that got here. Who knows what a mess we would have made of that.

Anyhow the opening credits reminded me of another Brooklyn street scene, this one John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Except they had the Brothers Gibb do the musical score and Dog Day had Diva Elton.

Good flick if only to see Pacino move. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1147305600,,1893,4.501457725947522
103837,5,0790733927,"Dog Day Afternoon is based on an actual event that took place in Brooklyn, New York in August 1973 and has become one of Al Pacino's signature roles. It also features lean, efficient filmmaking from Sidney Lumet who establishes life in the city through an expertly edited montage that shows people at work and at play with blue collar types, office workers and people of all races - a diverse melting pot.

Lumet walks a fine line between gritty crime film and absurdist comedy. The film is a prime example of an economy of direction as the filmmaker wastes no time. Pacino's intense performance constantly teeters on the edge of hysteria but it is always rooted in heartfelt realism that makes him a sympathetic character. Dog Day Afternoon would go on to inspire other movies, most notably a comic variation known as Quick Change starring Bill Murray.

The first disc on this new special edition features an audio commentary with veteran director Sidney Lumet. It's great to hear him talk about a movie he is clearly proud of. Lumet points out the bits that were improvised in the moment by the cast who were responding to their environment. He does a great job of taking us through this landmark movie in this informative commentary.

The second disc features ""The Making of Dog Day Afternoon"" that consists of four featurettes that can be viewed separately or altogether. Interestingly, Al Pacino didn't see himself in the role and passed but the producer eventually persuaded him to read it again and he decided to do it. Most of the main cast and crew contribute new interviews, including Pacino, Lumet, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon in this excellent retrospective look at this important film.

""Lumet: Filmmaker"" is a vintage featurette on the director done during the making of Dog Day Afternoon. We see him in action, directing the cast on location. This is a nice snapshot of the man back in the day.",1143763200,2,1916,4.814589665653496
103838,5,0790733927,"In writing a review of Dog Day Afternoon I had to do the dubious thing and ignor both the great cast and stellar director MR. Sidney Lamet, instead I had to face the true facts here, that this was Al Pacino's stage and has been since day 1. His perfomance in this film is so strong and breath-taking that it seems humanly impossible. It is a perfomance that brings up the sad bussiness of the Oscar, which even back then was more about acceptability then it ever was about stating some truthful final word on quality or perfomance. No offence to Jack Nicholson, but I can not help but feel, to this very day, like some kind of intolerable crime had been committed. Much like Richard Burton in Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf, this stands as one of the more heart breaking moments in the history of that award.

The main pitfall in watching this wonderful film is not getting caught up in the more showey aspects of Pacino's extraordinary perfomance. Most people, till this day, are drawn to this movie simply to see Al Pacino explode on screen in the infamous Attica scene, it is as if Al Pacino is a rock star or a circus act. This type of approach reduces the subtle context of Pacino's perfomance, which is far more then flexing actorly muscles, and actually hides the very meaning of this brilliant film from the misguided viewer.

On the strict surface this film shows an amazing spectacle taking place before your very eyes. Al Pacino's character Sonny is not your average Joe Blow either. Sonny is married to two people, one is the dumpy mother of his children, the other is a distraught whiney homosexual desperately craving a sex change operation. Sonny is also in the middle of the most life altering event of his crazy existance. The surreal self imposed situation is a bank robery gone wrong in which Sonny, the main perpetrator of this ill conceived crime, is forced to hold the bank employees hostage while the cops, the FBI, the press, the crowd of supportive and hostile spectators, and even the pizza guy show up. In essence, Sonny is the ultimate freak caught in the ultimate freak show. The real meaning of the film, however, is for the viewer to realize that dispite how abnormal these people are, and how exteme this event really is, that everyone has humanity in them. It would be all to easy to scoff in a low brow mannor at a queer man and his tourmented lover, but instead you only see two people hopelessly in love who can not find a way to live together. It is when you see this human pain, this human loss, the human tragidy, that you see just how poignant, and real, and meaningful, each and every moment of Dog Day afternoon truly is. For those not having the right approach to this masterpiece, the 14 straight minutes of Al Pacino on the phone, plus the reading of his will, might seem long and dull. It is only when you realize the impact these moments have, that you then know that you have just watched 20 minutes of perhapes the greatest acting in the history of motion pictures, and Al Pacino's greatest moments in his illustious career.",1143417600,3,3072,4.533333333333333
103839,5,0790733927,"As a big Pacino fan I just flat out bought this movie without ever viewing it before as I do with almost all movies I buy and I was very satisfied with the movie which happens to be a true story of a bank robbery gone bad, This is another movie you are glued to the movie set and cant stop watching highly recomended",1139702400,,316,3.953125
103840,5,0790733927,"Thirty years after ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was made, both Al Pacino's performance and the rest of the movie hold up extremely well. I had forgotten just how good everyone and everything connected with this movie are, from the direction of Sidney Lumet to the performances of the most minor of the actors.

This film is based on a true story of a most inexperienced criminal wanna-be who attempted to rob a bank on a sultry August day in 1972 in Brooklyn, New York where nothing goes right from the very beginning. One of the three robbers bails out immediately, and Sonny (Al Pacino) tips off a man across the street from the bank as to what is going on by setting on fire some bank documents. He's really such a good boy at heart though, in spite of his posturing,  making sure that all the bank hostages get to go to the bathroom, by tipping the pizza delivery person and warning everybody in the bank that ""I'm a Catholic and I don't want to hurt anybody."" His motives for robbery are noble as well.  He needed the money to pay for the surgery to make his boy friend into a woman. Never mind that his real-life wife and children wound up in welfare.

In spite of the seriousness of what is going on-- it really isn't a good idea to rob banks so we suspect that Sonny and his pal Sal will not escape to Algeria as is their plan-- there are many comic moments to this bungled affair. One of my favorites is when asked by Sonny what foreign country he wants to escape to, the taciturn Sal (John Cazale) selects Wyoming.

I do not remember what movie this one competed with but it was nominated for six Academy Awards including best actor. I suspect that Pacino should have won.",1134864000,2,1673,4.366559485530547
103841,5,0790733927,"One cannot help but feel a certain pity or sympathy for Sonny, the hapless protagonist of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. This is certainly no cut-throat villian, simply a luckless down and outer trying to make one big score to put a little daylight between himself and the small time life he leads.

The amateurish heist that Sonny and his cohort Sal try to pull quickly becomes a media circus and ends up being a large scale parallel of Sonny's existence in general. His life is a struggle against a society that wants to bring him down, and here he is up against a police force that is determined to do the same. Although the character Sonny has a slightly comical side to him, his partner Sal is quite different. His serious nature sometimes borders on sinister and is the quality that lends the film much of it's edge. Of the two main characters he seems like the one who is much more likely to snap and put his gun to use.

After Sonny and Sal have established some sort of a rapport with the girls who work in the bank, the movie takes on a more relaxed, benevolent feel. This allows for a certain charm in the film that would not have appeared possible at the outset.

'Dog Day Afternoon' ends up being a strange but fantastic mix of gun-slinging tension and oddball charm, that has it's rightful place in film history and creates an interesting new twist in the crime genre.",1133136000,,1372,4.45816733067729
103862,5,0790733927,"After a very successful collaboration on SERPICO, Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino did everyone a favor and teamed up again to make DOG DAY AFTERNOON.  Together, both films comprise some of the best work of the early 1970s.  The only shame is that, despite the films' critical acclaim, the DVD releases of both films leave much to be desired.

But, regardless of the quality of the DVD transfer and the lack of features, this film finds both Pacino and Lumet at the height of their powers.  DOG DAY AFTERNOON begins with the stark realism that I have come to expect from Lumet.  There is nothing hyped about his style: there is not an ounce of Hollywood.  Many directors, upon getting a hold of a ""bank robbery"" script, would have gone hog wild: special effects, quirky plot devices, etc..  Instead, we suddenly find ourselves on the streets of New York in the 1970s.  You really feel like you're there.  It is not a special day; in fact, it could be any day of the week.  And yet, two men are about to change their lives forever.  For it's closing time at the bank and they have one last stop to make.

Their plan was perfect.  They were going to rob the bank around closing time and they knew all of the tricks of the trade.  But slowly, and surely, their plan begins to unwind.  Everything goes to hell in a matter of minutes.  After taking way too much time, Pacino discovers that the armored car has already emptied the bank's vaults, leaving our two robbers with nothing but a little petty cash for their troubles.  By then, the cops have arrived.  The rest of the story is about watching Pacino's character unfold, a character that has little to gain and nothing to lose.  Sonny (Pacino) is one of the most interesting characters in all of cinema and there is a reason that, of all Pacino's performances, this is one of his most memorable.

DOG DAY AFTERNOON also provides a nice critique of the media, as the media becomes entranced with the bank robbery.  The scenes in which Pacino ""works"" the crowd, despite holding several hostages, is magnificent, inspiring the film's most famous line: ""Attica! Attica!""  For many in the city of New York, Sonny is their hero.  He is tired, fed-up, and marginalized by society because of his bisexuality.  Of course, the fame can only last so long, for when the media and crowd learn of his bisexual relations, they turn on him in an instant.  It is fascinating to watch the hostages at the bank become excited and wrapped up in the idea of being on television--so much so that they choose to stay in the bank rather than be set free!

DOG DAY AFTERNOON ends the way it begins: not with a bang, but with a whisper, and the same stark realism that opens the film sees it through to its conclusion.  If you haven't seen DOG DAY AFTERNOON, I suggest that you remedy it.  Check this film out.  You won't be disappointed.",1132704000,,2857,4.503891050583658
103863,5,0790733927,"Based on a true story, Al Porcino, in need of $2,700 so his homosexual lover Leon (Chris Sarandon) can have a sex-change operation, holds up a bank in Brooklyn with a dimwit friend (played by John Cazale); a half-hour knockover turns into a day-and-a-half fiasco. Porcino is great as the half-crazed Sonny who suddenly has a hundred responsibilities thrust in his lap: bank hostages, the media, the police, his wife (played by Susan Peretz), Leon, his mother - everything. It's a disaster.

Charles Durning gives a stellar performance as the police detective in charge, as does Cazale, who is perfect as Sonny's accomplice who is in way over his head (he thinks Wyoming is another country). The movie has a perfect NYC feel to it, with the large crowds forming outside the bank and immediately siding with Porcino (""Attica! Attica!"").

The only fault is that it goes on a tad too long; the last half-hour or so begins to drag - it's as if the results are already realized and the jig is up and they are just going through the motions to the conclusion. We're allowed to get inside Porcino's character, though, and see he's a good guy - but also a very troubled man. As we realize he's more a victim himself than a victimizer, he becomes a truly tragic figure, one we can honestly sympathize with. An excellent movie; definitely worth a watch.",1129680000,,1342,4.682203389830509
103864,5,0790733927,"Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and he gives an inspired performance in an extremely strange true story of a bank robbery. He plays Sonny who decides to rob a bank with the help of his somewhat half-witted friend Sal, played by John Cazale, another great actor from The Godfather (in fact they are the same pair that had the famous interaction in that movie: ""I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart... Fredo, you're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend...""). The reason for the heist is to get money for a sex change for Sonny's homosexual ""wife"" (he also has a female wife and two kids). At first, it seems to have been quite a misguided idea, as they are soon found by police, but then Sonny gets an idea: he will use the hostages to get whatever he wants, to try to get himself out of the country on a jet. The scene of the crime turns into something of a circus. Huge crowds gather outside and cheer every time Sonny comes out to talk with the cops and the media is having a heyday with the story.

The movie is a case of truth being stranger than fiction. It is a story that could not have been thought up. The direction of Sidney Lumet is amazing. The movie is at times quite hilarious as the story becomes more and more fantastic, but the end takes somewhat of a tragic turn. Highly recommended.",1122854400,2,1338,4.247058823529412
103865,5,0790733927,"From the first time I watched this movie, came to my mind the absurd theater, so well expressed in the middle of the thirties when some part of the rationality in the world had just taken a rest that endured almost eighty years. The decision to steal a bank without any prevision state, where the Kafka desperation,  the Sartre anxiety and the Camus ontological loneliness, shook hands. The reflected  microcosms showed a city in serious mental, existentialist and spiritual wounds originated for so many failures. Vietnam and its circumstances,  Watergate, the ideological sons of Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, the nostalgic gaze of Kerouac and Ginsherg,  and the oil crisis of 1973 became a true cresol that determined many living crossroads.

Lumet decided to film a portrait of the most profound loneliness between a male couple. But this mistake thriller is a metaphor of the whole mess in those difficult years all over the world. The terrorism played pitifully a first rate role: the Munich affair in 1972, The Symbiotic Liberation Army, the racial conflicts in South Africa, the increasing migration to Europe, the intestine conflicts in the far East, and the spouted insurrectional Governments based on Marxist currents in Center and South America, conformed such collective tension state that practically there was not any little corner in the world free of problem.

That's why the claustrophobic environment that surrounds the whole film from start to finish. And forget the typical happy ending. If there was a decade in which USA reflected the crude reality in all its implacable and fierce nakedness was in the Seventies.",1120262400,3,1639,5.142857142857143
103866,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon,"" an extraordinary movie in its own right, is made even more extraordinary because all of it was true.  This is a movie based primarily on character study, more so than the simple plot.

Here's the basic premise: two men set out to rob a bank, for reasons that become clear later in the film.  Sonny (Al Pacino, in his best performance to date, imo) is the mastermind of the heist, while Sal (John Cazale, equally brilliant) is the brooding follower.  However, the heist goes drastically wrong, and suddenly cops, TV cameras, and crowds surround the bank, and it turns into a circus.  It's a fascinating account of the seduction of celebrity, as evidenced by Sonny, the bank tellers (who want to remain inside the bank and give interviews instead of being saved), and, in a nice touch, the pizza man (who, after delivering the pizza while surrounded by the TV cameras, shouts, ""I'm a f***ing star!!"")

Frank Pierson wrote his Oscar-winning (well-deserved) screenplay around only twelve scenes, and the movie is 124 minutes, so it's pretty obvious from the get-go that the plot, even one as intriguing as this one, can't support this movie on its own.  This is where the acting comes in.  Al Pacino is wonderful wonderful wonderful as Sonny.  He is adorable in his dorkiness, and gets the nervous face tics, shuffle in his steps, and the wonderful boyish, insecure voice down pat.  Pacino's Sonny is fresh-faced and enormously likable, even as he is robbing the bank (although I think that Pacino naturally exudes this charm and likeability, even when he's playing less-than-perfect characters).  I've seen most of Pacino's films, and I consider this to be his best performance to date, even better than his amazing performance as Michael Corleone in the ""Godfather"" movies (and that's saying something, because I adore Michael Corleone).  It's definitely an Oscar-caliber performance, and he should have won it that year.  John Cazale is just as good as the brooding, reserved Sal, who is the perfect counterbalance to Pacino's screaming, wide-eyed, excitable Sonny.  Chris Sarandon (Oscar-nominated) is also very good as Leon, Sonny's lover and male ""wife"".  A very strong supporting cast makes the film even more enjoyable.

I said Pierson's Oscar for his screenplay was well-deserved because of the witty dialogue and extremely well thought-out, bitingly funny, and compassionate scenes.  Take, for example, the very memorable scene where Sonny tell police captain Moretti, ""Kiss me.  When I'm being f***ed, I like to get kissed a lot"" before shouting, ""Attica!  Attica!  Put those f***ing guns down!"" at the police, and wins the crowd's support.  The scene is pure adrenaline, and one of the most thrilling and exciting scenes I've ever witnessed on screen.  The best scenes in the movie are Sonny's two telephone conversations, one with his male wife Leon and the other with his female wife Angie.  Director Sidney Lumet claims that Pacino and Sarandon improvised most of their telephone conversation, which is a testament to the skills of both actors, as that telephone conversation is simultaneously funny (""Algeria?  Why are you going to Algeria?  There's crazy people who wear things on their heads"") and very poignant (""You're warped, you know that?"" ""I'm warped, I'm warped, I know it"").  Sonny's conversation with his wife Angie is just as good, with Pacino getting a chance to let out his trademark volcanic-ash tirade on her: ""Will you shut the f*** up and listen to me!  Just listen to me!""

These wonderful scenes work v. well together, capturing all the madness, poignancy, and compassion of the events.  It's a very well-made movie; the director knows the movie is a superb character-study and wisely sticks to just that, his characters.  One of my favorite movies, and a definite must-have for any DVD collection.  5/5",1118188800,6,3856,5.05379746835443

But what could have been a short, easy situation for the robbers, turns into a standoff. This film is not violent, but it makes a strong point.

I can't really put my finger in what it was, but this movie seemed to be missing something for me. Something about it didn't really click with me, and I think a small part of that is due to he fact that I'm not over 30. One of the seemingly important aspects of the movie (the Attica stuff) was completely lost on me. And while I love some of the absurdity of the movie, at the end, I was less than impressed.

This is one of Pacino's finest acting performances.  He consistnetly makes you feel both the stress and fear that ""sonny"" feels during the entire ""waiting"" period.  The way he displays ""sonny's"" emotions is really uamazing.  He is always on the edge of breaking, but always manages to keep his cool.

The way he portrays himself as this ""man-on-the-edge"" was so ""closet-realistic"" in the at-times-bluntly-mundane society that even though he was technically performing a criminal act, it was simply impossible to not cheer for the bad guy.

103892,5,0790733927,"Don't let the mild mannered Beatles' album-esque cover of this movie fool you. This is a sweaty, gritty, true crime vehicle for the genius that is Al Pacino. It just might be the best piece in the bank heist/standoff genre.
The basic premise is a straight and simple bank robbery goes awry from the start, and plummets to disaster when the cops enter the picture. Now the would be robbers turned kidnappers are trapped in the bank with some friendly hostages inside and a fleet of officers outside, all under the fervent eye of the press.
Even if it wasn't a true story, Dog Day is crafted with such realism, and stocked with such quality acting that it reads entirely believable and likely. No deus ex machina here. And sometimes fact IS much stranger than fiction- like Pacino's character ""Sonny's"" two ""wives"".
This film is packed with raw moments of absolute human emotion, theres no need to glamorize any of the characters, nor to demonize them. Director Sidney Lumet portrays his characters in all of their flawed and touching glory. Like Pacion's reaction to seeing ""Leon"" and then discovering he doesn't want to speak to him. Or the powerful cries of ""Attica! Attica!"" referring to the prison debauchle in 1971*.
A strange and nearly foreign feature of the film itself is the absence of music. The silence weighs heavy on the screen, forcing the actors themselves to create the tension and dramatic climaxes that music so often does for them.
I can't say enough about this film. It is one of the greats.

*In 1971, 1,300 prisoners rebelled against their guards and took over the Attica Prison facility in Western New York State. They held forty guards hostage. They had a list of demands for better living conditions including showers, education and vocational training.
After seven days of negotiations between the prisoners and government authorities, the national guard and state police seized the prison, killing forty-three people, incuding ten hostages.
The Medical Examiner's reports contradicted the statements of prison officials regarding the alleged atrocities committed against hostages. Autopsies revealed that hostages did not die from having their throats slashed by their captors, as had first been suggested by prison officials, but from the troops' deadly fire.

103894,5,0790733927,"Dog Day Afternoon is my favourite film. But what makes it stand out? A few things. Firstly, there's the acting.

Al Pacino is brilliant - obviously - and he makes Sonny seem really believable. Then there's the *sob* late John Cazale (who tragically died a year or two after Dog Day Afternoon was made,

from bone cancer) who is one of the most underrated actors ever. Then there's Chris Sarandon who is fantastic as Leon. Dog Day Afternoon isn't exactly meant to be a comedy, but I can't help but laugh at the bit when you first see him, and while Sonny is standing outside the bank, smiling and waving and shouting ""Leon!"", Leon is looking very confused and bewildered and then faints. It shouldn't really be funny, but it is... The rest of the cast are superb as well.

Something else that's good about Dog Day Afternoon is the lack of soundtrack (except for the cheesy Elton John song that plays at the start). The good thing about not having a soundtrack, is that it doesn't ruin the suprise. For example, when something scary is about to happen you don't know (unless, like me, you have rewatched Dog Day Afternoon a million times) because there is no creepy music playing, which it makes it all more exciting and shocking when it does happen.

The fact that Dog Day Afternoon is based on a true story also helps, because it adds another dimension to the film. At the end, in the airport scene (which is the only scene in a film that has ever made my cry), you see text at the bottom of the screen, telling you what happened to all the characters afterwards. I walked away thinking to myself ""I'd love to meet the real Sonny..."" Of course, I would probably be very disappointed - not all bank robbers look like Al Pacino.

The final thing that is great about Dog Day Afternoon is that it's very emotional, especially at the end but it's also funny in some places. Just looking at Sal makes me laugh (and cry when I think about what happens to him later) and there are some funny lines as well ""Sal, Wyoming's not a country.""

Al is in his twenties for this film, at the beginning of his career, around his first Godfather film. He is not the stoic mobster in this flick.  He is sensitive, screwed up, and angry.  I've never seen Pacino this vulnerable.  Brooklyn is exploding with post-Vietnam trauma.  The cops are stupid and clumsy.  The neighborhood kids are high and bored. The new TV culture is on the street making the botched robbery a classic hostage study, a Stockholm Syndrome of American stupidity. The acting is so good; you swear you're watching a documentary. The fat wife is screaming.  The idiot mother is crying. The gay lover is sprung from a mental hospital. America is at war with itself in 1972, panic in the streets. Sidney Lument has created a flawed masterpiece of suspense with the Oscar winning script by Frank Pierson. My two complaints: not sure why the wonderful character actor John Cazale (he died so young in real life) was considered so dangerous.

Al Pacino is superb as Sonny who wants the money to finance a sex-change operation for his transsexual lover (well done by Chris Sarandon). Aiding and abetting Sonny is half-wit Sal (John Cazale in a solid characterization) who chooses Wyoming as a foreign country destination for a safe haven. Charles Durning scores as Detective Moretti who spars with Sonny throughout the afternoon and arranges ""safe"" passage for him and Sal to JFK and their would-be flight to freedom. There are snippets of dialogue from the 1956 feature film, ""The Lone Ranger"", that is heard in the background during the hostage standoff inside the bank. Ironic because the Ranger's law-and-order message falls on deaf criminal ears during the commission of the felony.

Based of a true story Pacino is key to bringing this movie the punch it needs. How he handles people in the movie, his gestures and actions are Pacino at his best.  Combined with the movie Serpico, I would have to say these are the best films by Al Pacino from the 1970's before Scarface in 1980.

Loosely based on a real life bank robbery gone awry, literally EVERYTHING goes wrong, the look of sheer terror in Pacino's eyes as events spirally comically out of control is simply indescribable. Pacino's ability to finally lose control after so obviously trying to desperately hold it together throughout the movie, is breathtaking.

It also snatched best picture over it, and best director. While Cuckoo's Nest was a better movie, this one is still amazing.

103925,5,0790733927,"No one who is an appreciator of fine acting should ever pass on a Sidney Lumet film. Never known for his cinematographic innovations, it is practically a truism that Lumet managed to draw out life-best performances from the many good and great actors he's had working for him. I've never done the math, but I'd almost bet that he sports more best lead and supporting Oscars than any other director in the history of film.  His formula, if you can call it that, is turning up the heat on his characters to unbelievable pressure, but refusing to let them boil over.
In Dog Day Afternoon, Sonny, a very humanly desperate bank robber, experiences what has to be the most exasperating run of bad luck in the history of bank robberies.  Not only is he saddled with a klutz for a partner (also played and written with heart-torquing humanity), but they have to take hostages, there's no money in the bank, a fire starts in a garbage can, sheer chance causes a shopper across the street to notice something strange in the bank so the police are called.  Bad enough so far, especially on a swelteringly unbearable day.  Eventually the police arrive, who are in turn surrounded by a mob of people who are more supportive of the bank robbers than the police (this is, after all, 1972).  The bank robbers even begin to befriend their hostages, until finally Sonny's secret lover shows up to tell the gathered media how Sonny was robbing the bank to pay to get him a sex change.  Sonny is baffled, the police are baffled ... only the mob seems sure of anything on this improbably crazy day in New York.  And what makes the movie most unbearably sad and funny at the same time is that it's all based on true events.
Just as Lumet was able to pull off being limited to a single juryroom with 12 men in ""Twelve Angry Men"" without allowing the movie to become boring, the larger canvass of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" disguises the fact that this is basically a drama that takes place in a single room as well.  Precisely as the characters don't rant and scream normally in a Lumet movie, so also is it the very staticness of plot, which feels like everyone is hold their breath waiting for something to happen, that makes it so nerve-tingling.
The acting is great, but Pacino is impeccable.  Eschewing the uncut machismo that de Niro has allowed himself to be molded by, here Pacino's tough-guy bank robber is more of an endlessly put-upon Job.  Lumet has framed things so that it's as if Sonny was just going to run into a deli to get a sandwich, and ended up in the midst of some giant shoot-out.  Never has a movie about sheer bad luck been so well-made.
If there was ever a movie that cried, ""Oh for god's sake"" from beginning to end, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is that movie, and it does so with inimitable style.  A genuine classic and must-see Pacino.",1042934400,2,2827,4.5

It's also Pacino doing the finest work of his career. He is incredible in a difficult role; his stamina holds up throughout without any breaks in continuity, and he is able to make Sonny both tragic and likeable, even for all of the character's flawed logic and bumbling ineffectiveness as a robber. The scene towards the end when he dictates his will to the bank teller who writes it up is one of the most moving scenes in all of cinema. Lumet and crew are to all to be commended. The film's atmosphere is perfectly captured--you can FEEL the stifiling, sweltering heat inside the bank as if you are sitting in there with the hostages. If DDA hadn't been released during the same year as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (which swept almost ALL the Academy Awards in almost every major category for 1975) it would have won all of the same awards, hands down, as far as I'm concerned. As it turned out, it unfortunately won only one award, for screenplay. But awards or not, you will NEVER forget this movie.

103928,5,0790733927,"This is one of the best ""based on true events"" movies that you will ever see. It tells the story of a bank robbery that first turned into a hostage taking and then became a piece of street theatre in New York one hot summer's day in the early seventies.
Sonny (Al Pacino) wanted to rob a bank to raise money for his boyfriend to have a sex change. Together with Sal (John Cazale) he held up a small bank in New York at closing time. They bungled the robbery and, instead of getting away with the money, they found themselves inside the bank surrounded by cops and with the entire staff as hostages.
Over several hours, they tried to negotiate a way out with the police and FBI. The negotiations took place on the street outside the bank in full view of a growing audience and, despite the attempts of the negotiators, the whole thing turned into a piece of street theatre.
Al Pacino does a brilliant job in the role of Sonny. It is easy to believe that this character could plan the robbery and then think and react as he did in what then became a siege. John Cazale does not make such an impression but, in part, that is because of the way that his part is scripted and set as a quiet, introverted type. Penelope Allen, in the role of Sylvia the chief cashier, is a fine support to Pacino. Like him, her character is always on the brittle edge but holding her staff together.
Nobody else really makes much of an impression, the cops, lead by Charles Durning as Detective Eugene Moretti and James Broderick (I) as FBI agent Sheldon are pretty much standard issue out of the hollywood box of stock characters. Sonny's weird assortment of relations who get wheeled on to the scene seem almost as much an irritation to the audience as they are to him.
That does not detract from the movie though which is all about Pacino's barnstorming performance and an Oscar winning script that just buzzes along. This is a great movie, it is full of tension and drama but also lightened with some very funny moments and we get to see a great actor giving his all.
One of the strongest attractions of this movie is Al Pacino who is as his raw, edgy best. If you liked his performance, you should check out ""Serpico"", ""Panic in Needle Park"" and ""Scarecrow"" which all allow him to display the same talents that he shows in ""Dog Day Afternoon"".",1019260800,,2325,4.409302325581395

However, the movie does tend to be a little on the slow-moving side, being over 2 hours in length.  Very good, though.  Al Pacino does a great job acting.",1018742400,,454,4.345238095238095
103930,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" brings to the screen a bank robbery that supposedly happened in Brooklyn on a sweltering August day in 1972.  Two down-and-out losers, Sonny and Sal, terrifically played by Al Pacino and John Cazale, stroll into a bank near closing time, with the purported intention to rob it.  They are accompanied by a third accomplice who has the good sense to get cold feet before the deal even beings to go down.  We're like, wassup with these bozos... Sonny almost drops the rifle taking it out of the box it's gift-wrapped in as he and Sal proceed with the fell deed.  It should be a piece of cake, in-and-out, right?  Well, guess what: Sonny, who acts like he's about as smart as a pet rock, gets the brilliant idea to set the bank records afire, sending smoke billowing out of the exhaust system, which is promptly noted by a concerned citizen, and next thing you know, New York's Finest is swarming over the vicinity.  The whole block is jammed with rubberneckers and police, and now it's a standoff: Sonny and Sal have the bank managers and the tellers hostage.  Sonny knows how to play to his audience, though; he's out on the sidewalk hurling bundles of green into the crowd and almost starts a riot.  We start thinking, maybe this guy is crazy like a fox.  The crowd clearly loves Sonny and he's a media star on the 6 o'clock news, until it becomes clear why he pulled the robbery: he needed the money for a sex change operation for his gay lover.  Ut oh... the crowd that loved Sonny because he was making New York's Finest look like idiots now despise him because he's bi-sexual.  Things come to a climactic resolution in the movie's final scenes, and the ending is kind of what we expected, but the movie is great fun to watch through its various twists and turns to reach the inevitable.  The major actors are uniformly terrific; so many great performances that I can't single any one out.  Even the minor actors are inspired, especially Lionel Pina as the pizza man who seizes a passing moment to do his own star turn, and Penelope Allen as the head teller Sylvia, whose icy calm helps to keep everyone, including Sonny, from going berserk.  The cinematography is excellent and gives the film its convincing atmosphere; we're smack in the middle of a sizzling hot day in a New York City summer and sweltering right along with the characters.  This movie is one of the truly great ones from the 1970's and it gets better with age.  It's a quintessential New York story.",1016064000,,2491,4.564044943820225

(she adviced Sonny to run away even though the FBI , NYPD , and all of New York City was watching. Hilarious!) This is pretty much a depiction of Murphy's Law going into full effect for these two guys trying to rob a bank. Part of the reason why the film is intriguing is because the story makes you care about how these two guys are going to get out of this situation. It glues you to the tv. It makes you care about everyone involved with very well developed characters.
The acting is grade A+ all the way through this film. This is acting 101. ""Sonny"" is one of Pacino's Oscar nominated performances. Pacino has a way of keeping you fixed on him but the supporting cast more than complements him with terrific performances. (my favorite scene : Sonny's phone conversations with Leon and Angie. Perfect!) The film earned six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and won for best original screenplay. The film , excellently , captures the feel of summertime in the city. The opening of the film , effectively , establishes the tone and the feel of the setting. The screenplay Oscar was well earned. One of my favorite films.

Within minutes, the attempted robbery heads for disaster, as the police and media surround the bank while Sonny holds the employees hostage for the entire day.

103947,5,0790733927,"I saw this movie because of my respect for Sidney Lumet.  He is up there with Scorsese as one of the finest American directors.  This film is as good as Lumet's other masterpiece Twelve Angry Men.  However, I don't want to talk about Lumet in this review.  I want to talk about Al Pacino whose performance I regard as being the best in cinema's golden history.
Pacino's performance as Sonny is breathless.  He says so himself:  ""I can't breathe"".  The film's short time period helps create this feeling of tension and intensity inside Pacino.  He is a complicated character who I still can't fully understand after numerous viewings.  Is he really gay?  Why does he treat Leon so badly and yet the whole bank heist is in Leon's best interest.  What is the relationship with Sal?  Why would he bring such a liability along with him?
We get to know Sonny in short visits by Sonny's parents and Sonny's wife.  He is an enormously affecting character.  Though Sonny and Sal are the bank robbers, we grow fond of them because of their deeply moving performances.  We share in Sonny's anxiety in his relationship with the FBI.  He trusts no one.  Not even the bank tellers who he befriends.
The best scenes to watch Pacino at work are: his frustration when the tellers have to go to the bathroom; the famous ""ATTICA"" scene; the improvised phone-call to Leon (Chris Sarandon); and the finale ""Don't shoot me"".  Sonny is one of the greatest characters in the movies perhaps because he is a real life one.

Al Pacino is mezmerizing as Sonny.  His performance is so heartwrenching...you don't know how things are going to turn out, but you just want him to be able to finally breathe.  And his good natured trusting mentality really skews our perspective of what crime really is.  His sidewalk cries of ""Attaca, Attaca"" were inspired.  The direction is stellar.

Inside the bank, Sonny finds a rapport with the hostages and comes up with a grand scheme to escape to Algeria.  Dull-witted Sal however, is smart enough to realize that chances are nil that they're going to get out of this.

Despite the fact that many of the incidents in the movie,like live coverage of a crime event, are no longer a novelty and in some senses you know what to expect in the end, this movie had me riveted throughout.
Mr. Sidney Lumet makes you feel the sweat of that afternoon. You want to know what the next scene is and you would personally kill the theatre owner if the projector were to conk off in between. He does not need to infuse any more drama than there is already in the story and he does not try to. Mr. Lumet brings the""perpetrators"" to life without fawning over them. Whether to empathize with them or not is left entirely to the viewer. I personally just accepted the two characters for what they were. A product of the society and times, a disaster waiting to happen. As Sonny says ""It is on nobody""
Mr. Al Pacino was just fantastic. Wow! He holds stage for the entire duration of the movie and you want more not less. ""dda cops"" in Brooklyn may have forgotten Sonny Wortzik and nobody may know ""Attica"" any more but anybody who has watched this movie will never forget Mr. Pacino's performance in it. Hats off.

103982,5,0790733927,"Al Pacino burns up the screen in Dog Day Afternoon which is based on a true story and confirms that fact that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  Mr. Pacino plays Sonny who teams up with the dullard Sal (John Cazale) to rob a Brooklyn bank on a sweltering summer afternoon.  Sonny was a one-time bank employee, so he knows all the tricks of the trade to thwart bank robbers.  Unfortunately for the robbers, the bank virtual has no money do to having made a deposit only hours before the robbery attempt.  A shopworker across the street from the bank notices the strange proceedings and calls the cops.  Before you know it, the bank is completely surrounded by cops.  The cops (led by Charles Durning & James Broderick) start a hostage negotiation with Sonny.  Even though Sonny's a crook, he isn't all bad and he, Sal and the hostage bank workers form a strange kinship.  The story is shown on TV and a crowd gathers in the streets as well and Sonny becomes something of a cult hero.  His scenes on the street outside the bank are scintillating including his famous Attica chant.  Sonny is married with kids, but it turns out that he was robbing a bank to pay for a sex change operation for his gay lover, Leon (Chris Sarandon).  The movie closes out at night at the airport in dramatic fashion.  Sidney Lumet does a fine job translating the heat and humidity of the day and you can feel yourself sweating along with the characters.  Mr. Pacino has been more heralded for his Godfather roles, Scarface, Serpico and Scent Of A woman, but in my book, he was never finer than he was in this movie.",981072000,74,1601,4.498269896193771
103983,5,0790733927,I had never seen the movie before in my life but only heard about it. I saw it for DVD foronly 14 dollars so picked it up.  I watched it that day and was amazed by how well it looked on DVD. Even though it was a 70's film the DVD made it look laki it was made in the 90's. Al Pacino was great as the bisexual who holds up the bank. Based on a true story about two men who ended up holding up a bank.  Al Pacino had worked in a bank before and knew all the tricks to get by security. While burning the files the owner across the streets see's the smoke and so calls the police.  This is where the fun begins. What turns out afterwords is exciting and a great story that never lets you go.,980726400,,687,3.7902097902097904
103984,4,0790733927,"I bought Dog Day Afternoon on DVD completly at random, just based on the actors, and the synopsis.  On the back of the case, this movie is branded as a ""boisterous comedy"" that is ""Bitingly Funny"".  And while the movie certainly has its funny parts, it never has one-liner jokes, or much situational humor.  It is more of a comedy as a whole, and just about how the whole bank robbery got screwed up.  Accually, it is really quite serious in tone.
So once you get past the aboslutly false statements that this is a comedy, you start to see the magic of this film.  It is a very static movie, and the everything takes place in or around the bank throughout the entire movie until the very end.  The story isn't driven through action sequences, rather it is driven by the brilliant dialoge between characters.
When watching this movie, you will feel like you are right there, inside this movie.  You will progress right along with the main character, Sonny.  You watch his attitude change from being very optimistic and hopeful, into a more frustrated, disjointed, and confused character.  Al Pacino does a brilliant job showing the many changes that Sonny goes through.  You can literally see the preasure on Sonny's face as time is running out, and as his plans keep getting more and more screwed up.
Not only does Al Pacino do a brilliant job, but the other characters are amazingly protrayed as well.  Other notable performances are Leon (Sonny's disconnected boyfriend), Sal (Sonn'y partner), and even Detective Moretti.  Every character is so believable and real that you will truly feel like you have met them all first hand.
One thing that I have noticed about Dog Day Afternoon is its influences on more modern movies.  As I was watching it, I couldn't help but recognize modern movies in it.  Two examples that came to mind the most are Mad City, and Airheads.  In Mad City, John Travoltra's character is also faced with a media circus as he holds a group of school kids and their teacher hostage in a meauseam.  The frenzy of media coverage, the public reaction, and the way that the main character becomes friendly with the hostages all give a very big nod to Dog Day Afternoon.  In Airheads, I noticed that the way one of the guys who had taken the radio station hostage would come outside to talk to the cops, and while he was out there, he would incite the crowd and start different chants.  In Airheads, one of the hostage takers started the crowd in a ""Rodney King"" chant, while in Dog Day Afternoon, Al Pacino started the crowed in an ""Attica"" chant.  These sequences are so familiar that I am convinced the screen writers had Dog Day Afternoon in mind when writing them.
Overall, this is a fantastic movie that is full of brilliant performances.  But for some, it may seem way to static, and slow moving.
As far as DVD features go, the picture quality is superb, considering that the original film is from the mid 70's.  The audio is Dolby Mono tracked, but nothing else is neccesary.  There are no sound effects to speak of - it is all pretty much dialogue - so the mono track is sufficient.  As far as extras, if you consider Scene Selections and Interactive Menus to be ""extras"", then you will be happy, but I would say that this DVD is as bare as they get.  I can't stand when DVD Case designers try and pass off these standard 'features' as extras.  That is like a CD advertising its ability to change tracks with the touch of a button.
Great movie - decent DVD transfer.",980380800,37,3493,4.5504
103985,5,0790733927,"Based on a true story of a botched Brooklyn bank robbery heist, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a suspenseful, attention-grabbing account of a young, innocent looking man named Sonny (Pacino), who attempts to rob a bank to pay for his boyfriend/lover's (Chris Sarandon) sex-change operation. One of the film's most chilling scenes occurs at the beginning, where Sonny enters the bank with his two cronies Sal (Jon Cazale) and Sonny's boyfriend (Sarandon) with a large, rectangular gift box, supposedly containing flowers. After presenting the teller with a withdrawal slip, Sonny calmly steps away from the counter, nervously, hurriedly opens the box, pulls out a rifle and shouts ""Allright, freeze, nobody move!"". His partner Sal also points an automatic gun at the bank manager (Sully Boyar), and the tone of the movie is set. Sonny then lets his boyfriend go when he is unable to go through with Sonny's plans. After what appears to be a clean getaway, someone outside the bank from across the street sees smoke appearing from the bank's ventilator, at which time Sonny attempts to burn up the account ledger. The police and the FBI are informed about the heist, and what follows is a some two-hour hostage of everyone inside the bank. In the meantime, Sonny is attempting to negotiate with the chief of police (Charles Durning) and the head of the FBI (James Broderick) to avoid any kind of possible tragedy regarding the bank's employees. Rather than give the ending of the movie away, I suggest you buy ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and see for yourself. The VHS version contains added bonus footage of cast and film staff interviews, so you're in for a real treat here!",976665600,3,1657,4.921428571428572
103986,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" still feels fresh to me.  Maybe because Lumet packed so much talent and so many unforgettable moments into it.  Why should you watch it?
It's the best Pacino has ever been.  (I thought the Oscar belonged to him and not to Nicholson that year.)  Want to see how far into a character a good actor can delve?  Watch his face after he hangs up the phone from talking to his wife (no, not Chris Sarandon -- the other wife).
It's not only the late John Cazale in another of his brilliant 70s performances, but it's Pacino and Cazale together again after the two ""Godfathers.""
It's the quintessential New York location movie.
Sarandon's near-monologue in the barber shop is so convincing, you'll think, ""No way was this guy ever married to Susan!""
Sully Boyar's naturalistic approach to his role of the bank manager might have you thinking, if you've never seen him before, that he's not a professional actor.
James Broderick's performance as the FBI agent is a masterpiece of iceberg acting (in which 90% of what's going on is beneath the surface, making the 10% you do see that much more powerful).
Pacino again, this time -- well, not to give anything away -- let's just say the look on his face the last time he sees the bank staff.
Oh, so much more!  I guess I'll quit here with two final words.  ""Attica!  Attica!""",976579200,8,1333,4.571428571428571
103987,4,0790733927,"This is one of those rare films that, having never seen before, I would come across one lazy Sunday afternoon of channel surfing, and the cinematic imagery on screen strangely grasps my attention instead of instantly propelling me to move on and find a football game or something.  I guess it's kinda comparable to a bad traffic accident; you know it's wrong to gawk, but you just can't look away.
So what makes this true story of a disheveled loaf (Al Pachino), who decides to alleviate some of his more bizarre economic needs by taking a stab at the bank-robbing profession, such an intriguing mess?  For one, the character development provides the viewer with many clever personality sketches of unique and involving individuals as opposed to typical, standard formula, two-dimensional stereotypes.  There are no caricature cutouts here.  In addition, there's the facetious irony of the NYPD and the FBI being out-witted by this hapless duo for most of the day, and it doesn't help law enforcement any that an on-looking crowd is loving every minute of it.  You will never find two dumber criminals than Sonny and his mental-midget for a partner, Sal.  Aside from devising no escape or back-up plan for the robbery, they show their ineptitude by negotiating ludicrous terms with the police.  Sonny tells his partner that they need to fly out of the country.  Sal suggests Wyoming.  After discovering that Wyoming is not a country, they settle on Algeria of all places.  The freak show reminds you of that Southwest Airlines commercial with the slogan ""Want to get away?""
The movie seems to be no more than a retelling of that afternoon's events, but it does so in a very compelling way and without taking sides or manipulating the viewer's emotions.  At the end we may feel some sympathy for the captors, but the film keeps us at enough distance so that we may soon shrug it off and objectively realize that what becomes of criminals, no matter how incompetent or simple minded, is typically what they deserve.",974678400,,2013,4.856725146198831
103988,5,0790733927,"Brilliant film version of the real-life events that occurred when Brooklyn resident Sonny Wortzik and his pals tried to rob a bank to pay for Sonny's boyfriend's sex-change operation. It was supposed to be a ten-minute robbery, in and out, but when the police get news of the events, the boys have to take some bank tellers hostage and the street outside becomes a war zone; when the media and the public catch wind of this, all of Brooklyn becomes a circus. Al Pacino and John Cazale are fantastic as the criminals, Chris Sarandon wonderful as Sonny's suicidal boyfriend, and Penelope Allen (my favourite performance in the film) is just a genius as the smart-talking head teller of the bank who instantly gains the nickname ""mouth"".  Other cast members include Charles Durning as the policeman in charge of handing the hostage situation and a very young Carol Kane (the same year she did Hester Street and got an Oscar nomination) as one of the tellers whose worried about jeopardizing her marriage by going home too late. Edge-of-your-seat tension (thanks to Dede Allen's editing) and the added bonus of some great comedy that comes from watching these guys and their lack of expertise in the matter of solid crime.",971740800,2,1218,4.855769230769231
103989,5,0790733927,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a perfect example of why the 70's were a shining decade for filmmaking... not only one of Al Pacino's best  performances, but Sidney Lumet's best film as well.  From start to finish,  it is a humorous, energetic, piece of pure entertainment (even though it is  depicting a real incident).  Every scene is engrossing, every performance a  vital component to the overall endproduct.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not  offer any special features other than the widescreen option, and I would  have loved to hear commentary or even see the original theatrical trailer.  Maybe a special edition in the future?  Regardless, the film itself is  worth owning.",967680000,,673,5.073394495412844
103990,4,0790733927,"This 1975 hit based on a true bank robbery in the Midwood section of Brooklyn in 1972 was filmed in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Sonny (Pachino) plays a nervous troubled bank robber who wants money for his wifes sex change operation. He becomes surrounded by police and is turned into a media sensation. The 70s flick comes two decades before Natural Born Killers a movie in which criminals are glorified. This true story however is so much more down to earth and believable not to mention likeable that the bank personell who beccme hostages feel a sympathy mostly for Sonny. His partner John Cazale is less liked and a bit more sociopathic. Once the media is alerted and crowds and onseekers prevail the summer heat and hostility becomes transendant. Charles Durning plays the negotiator cop role and aside from one of the hostages boyfriend, does not win public appeal. The bottom line is that this movie is well acted and captures the amazment the real event caused in Brooklyn in the early 70's. Al Pachino was nominated for many Oscars on this one and to date ranks as one of his best films!",961545600,,1104,4.666666666666667
