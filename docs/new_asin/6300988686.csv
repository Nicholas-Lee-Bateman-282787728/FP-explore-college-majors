7808860,5,6300988686,"It's an enjoyable episode. Kirk beams down to a planet and is lost track of. The leader of the planet claims he has no idea what went wrong. And he doesn't allow any else to beam down.

Then Kirk seams to be still on the enterprise. But he is alone on
the ship except for one unknown woman. And the woman claims she doesn't know what she is doing there or how she got there. Kirk
tries to figure out what is going on.

It has interesting dialog. I like it.",1286582400,,456,4.0
7808861,5,6300988686,"I can't get over how brilliant this episode is.  This episode effectively shows what a planet would be like if all the inhabitants did not use contraception.

Unlike other reviewers, I see no major plot holes in this episode.  Kirk beamed down into a holodeck.  The Enterprise was an exact duplicate because the Gideons scanned Kirk's mind to fill in every little detail.  There was an episode from TNG called Future Imperfect that used this technique.

And I see no faults with the idea of using disease as an effective way of reducing population.  People who are opposed to contraception suggest that population should be controlled only naturally (i.e., war, disease, and famine).  The writings of Thomas Malthus clearly articulate this view point.  Therefore, it is extremely plausible that the Gideons would want to reintroduce disease as oppose to using ""evil"" contraception.

And the people can't be seen on the planet because the Gideons are projecting a false image.  If people from Gary Seven's planet can hide a whole planet, I think the Gideons can change the appearance of theirs and block out sensor scans.

Finally, Spock was not tricked by the transport coordinates.  He told the Admiral that the Captain was not being held in the Gideon Council Chamber.  After his conversation, he said that Command knew that the Gideons were not totally honest.  He then made Uhura and Scotty repeat the transport coordinates.  Therefore, Spock knew there was a discrepancy the entire time.  I'm sure that if he can calculate huge odds in his Vulcan head that he can remember a nine digit number.

""One of my pet themes is overpopulation,"" related Fred Freiberger, producer of Season Three, ""and I thought this was a good idea.  We were taking a shot at something fresh and gutty, and it worked out pretty well.  That one was also shot entirely on the Enterprise.  I felt if we had to do the show under those restrictions, we had to come up with good stories and that one worked.""

I'm writing this because I don't want people to keep on bashing this amazing episode.  This is such a brilliant episode because it deals with a highly controversial issue in an effective way.  I find this episode to be intellectually stimulating because it shows the opinions of both sides of this controversy and it practically references the writings of Thomas Malthus.  If you are going to bash an episode, pick another because this episode is one of the best.",1242259200,,2447,4.824519230769231
7808862,1,6300988686,"C'mon. The planet is so overpopulated that every mountain is covered with people, but they found the acreage to construct this monstrous fake Enterprise. The planet Gideon isn't in the Federation, but they got a hold of the blueprints to build an exact replica of the Federation's flagship, perfect enough to fool the captain. Not to mention that Kirk never once worries about operating the ship by himself...in fact the ""fake"" ship leaves Gideon orbit (it was still in orbit when Kirk first gets there) without Kirk so much as flipping a switch...the problems with this episode go on and on. And besides all that, it's BORING!  I actually enjoy the banter between Spock and Hodin, but the rest of it, zzzzz. Nothing happens. Chemistry beween Odana and Kirk? Not much. The Gideon's entire plan is so alarmingly stupid on every level...it's no wonder when Spock shows up to beam Kirk and Odana out of there, Hodin (after having gone to all of this effort) stands there like a statue without protest. This episode is worse than the Lights of Zetar (which is spookier), worse than And The Children Shall Lead (where at least they hand out ice cream), and worse than Spock's Brain (which is wildly amusing). That means the Mark of Gideon stands alone as the Worst Episode Ever.",1076976000,2,1273,4.760180995475113
