8431315,5,B004IWTQK6,"A touching film. Excellent actors, good plot, convincing action, and although almost the entire film deals with dying, it is still gripping in many parts. Insiders of the cult opus dei can recognize a lot of scenes showing the daily life and special attitudes within the cult.
What is troublesome for a Central European viewer is that the film is in Spanish without English subtitles and the DVD is encoded for the North American region (1). You can live with both, but sometimes it makes the viewing tedious!",1466121600,,509,4.795454545454546
