4599639,5,B0058K88K6,"With his perceived snooty ways and that vaguely sinister air and his awesomely snide but oh-so-elegant delivery of dialogue (man, that rich baritone!), it's a cinch that Englishman George Sanders would land scripts offering him the plum villain role. But, once in a blue moon, the gent did end up playing the heroic lead. Case in point, he starred in several B-flicks in the Falcon franchise. And, before that, he breathed life into the adventurer and amateur sleuth Simon Templar a.k.a. the Saint. Sanders was, hands down, more memorable than Louis Hayward and Hugh Sinclair, the two actors who bookended him in the franchise. This two-disc set, THE GEORGE SANDERS SAINT MOVIES COLLECTION, serves up all five of Sanders' briskly-paced exploits as the Saint, a champion of the underdog and of fair play and who abides by the law when it suits, and goes his own way when it doesn't. And who doesn't love the Saint's signature calling card and that haunting theme song he tends to whistle at the drop of a hat?

- THE SAINT STRIKES BACK (1939)

This rather talky mystery debuts George Sanders as the Saint and co-stars Wendy Barrie in the first of her three appearances in this franchise (although she would play a different character each time). In San Francisco, on New Year's Eve, Simon Templar's busybody bump of curiosity is piqued when a murder takes place in a nightclub. Wendy Barrie plays the hard-boiled femme fatale Val Travers. Daughter of a disgraced policeman, Ms. Travers enlists her own crew of crooks to make it tough on them coppers. But scheming in the shadows lurks an elusive criminal mastermind, if only Templar can be bothered to take a break from his amorous flirtations with Ms. Travers. Based on Leslie Charteris' novel ANGELS OF DOOM. Co-starring Barry Fitzgerald and Neil Hamilton.

- THE SAINT IN LONDON (1939)

I think this one and THE SAINT TAKES OVER are the two superior entries in George Sanders' run. Based on Charteris' short story ""The Million Pound Day,"" THE SAINT IN LONDON begins with Templar befriending a pickpocket named Dugan (David Burns) and hiring him as his new manservant. Moments later, an old pal from British Intelligence tips him to shady shenanigans involving an abducted ambassador and a ruthless extortionist. Meanwhile, inquisitive socialite Penny Parker (Sally Gray, full of feisty) suspects Templar of being the Saint and gets underfoot enough that she almost deserves the slug on the jaw that the Saint inadvertently delivers. And as if Templar doesn't have enough on his plate, he keeps running into a dogged Scotland yard Inspector. This is a terrific little thriller, highlighted by Sanders' predictably standout performance but also by David Burns' tough-talking, street-savvy valet and Sally Gray's delightfully plucky turn. Keep an eye out for the Saint's neat over-the-shoulder knife toss.

- THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE (1940)

Camera trickeration plants two George Sanders side by side as he plays both the Saint and his equally nattily dressed doppelganger, ""Boss Duke Bates."" Diamonds smuggled from Cairo to Philadelphia soon hook in Simon Templar, especially when he ends up incriminated for the smuggling... and, later, for murder. As usual, the Saint treats such alarming turn of events as frightfully good sport. And to demonstrate that the halo on his calling card is more for rakish effect, Templar metes out his own cruel and unconventional brand of justice. Lots of keeping score in the viewer's mind as he tries to keep straight just which character Sanders is playing at any given moment. And that's probably my big gripe about this film, that Sanders doesn't do enough to create a distinct separation between his two roles. Helpful hint: Simon is the one in the black suit while the lookalike is gigged out in the striped suit. Sanders' voice is so distinct and so richly modulated that even when he goes for the crooked ringleader's gangster diction, it still comes off sounding posh. If not for the Saint's identifying cross-shaped scar, our boy may yet be in a pickle. Bela Lugosi has a forgettable supporting role as the shady partner. Jonathan Hale returns in his semi-recurring role of Inspector Fernack (who, more or less, is in Templar's camp). Helene Whitney plays the archaeology professor's lovely daughter Anne Bitts.

- THE SAINT TAKES OVER (1940)

When a racketeering ring frames Templar's friend, Inspector Henry Fernack, the Saint springs into action. But, as the body count mounts, a mysterious woman (Wendy Barrie) persists in complicating Simon's investigation. Jonathan Hale is more prominent this time out as his character, Inspector Fernack, suddenly has all this free time to put in some unofficial field work with the Saint, seeing as how he's been suspended from duty. Sanders and Hale are quite good together, and it's a gas watching Templar's perpetual teasing of Fernack, what with the good Inspector consistently being the first guy popping up at each murder scene. This becomes so suspicious that even ""Pearly"" Gates (Paul Guilfoyle), the dimwit safecracker whom Templar recruits to the cause, finally puts his foot down. He declares: ""I'm wiping my hands of this crime wave."" THE SAINT TAKES OVER features one of the more somber endings in the franchise. It's rare that you see the Saint in a melancholy mood, but this only enriches the narrative.

- THE SAINT IN PALM SPRINGS (1941)

Chalk up another favor Inspector Fernack's gonna owe the Saint. This time the copper talks Simon into escorting an old wartime buddy scheduled to transport $200,000 in rare postage stamps from New York to Palm Springs. When Fernack's pal gets bumped off, it's up to the Saint to continue the mission. In Palm Springs, Simon is greeted by foreign agents, wicked femme fatales, and an old friend, dour-faced Clarence ""Pearly"" Gates, who's serving out his prison probation and now working as a hotel house detective. Wendy Barrie, this time around, plays the murdered courier's niece and she's one of the two beautiful dames elbowing each other for affection from our toff with the tarnished halo. Can the Saint and his sidekick Pearly solve the case and also keep an eye on them stamps what keeps vanishing on them? This is the one which has a harebrained plot point involving Pearly's house detective nicking all the hotel guests' personal valuables in an attempt to uncover a murderer. It's one of the Saint's most lunatic ideas yet. And it sort of pays off.",1313971200,85,6453,5.005591798695247

4599698,4,B0058K88K6,"The Saint, created by Leslie Charteris, hit movie theaters in 1938 with Louis Heyward in the title role. George Sanders took over in 1939 and played the Saint in five films.  This Warner Archives collection collects all five films on a two DVD set.

The films, are somewhat above average B movie fare. The Saint is a figure who walks very close to the edge of the law and is as often hunted by the police as he is the hunter of criminals. Each film includes the Saint teaming up with some recently formed though not all too bright criminal.

The films really work thanks to Sander's debonair portrayal of the Saint as well as some great supporting characters in the typical roles of police, sidekick, and leading lady.  In four of the five films Jonathan Hale plays the affable and sympathetic Inspector Fernack who is often torn between his sense of duty and his friendship for the Saint and also serves as a comic foil.  Paul Guifoyle plays a criminal who reforms in The Saint Takes Over and then appears as the same character who is now a house detective in The Saint in Palm Springs.  Finally, Wendy Barrie plays three different female leads in the first, fourth, and fifth films.

With that said, here are my thoughts on each film>

The Saint Strikes Back: The Saint helps a female mob boss escape from the scene of a shooting, then flies back to New York to contact Inspector Fernack and get him out to San Francisco with many in San Francisco wanting Fernack to come out any way because it's suspected the Saint's involved in the murder. The Saint tries to ensure justice is done and to reform the female mob boss who became a crime boss after she believed her father was framed for murder. The plot's a bit convulted but really it's a well executed and tight story that that wraps up nicely in a little more than hour.  Grade: B+

The Saint in London:  The Saint returns to London, hires a pickpocket as a valet, and then is called into a case by an old friend that involves kidnapping, embezzlement, and of course, murder. This is just a very fun movie. Sally Gray is great as the adventurous female lead. David Burns is good as the Saint's sidekick, Dugan and Gordon Macleod does very well as Inspector Claude Teal of Scotland Yard. This was just a solid film overall. Grade: A-

The Saint's Double Trouble:  Easily the weakest of Sanders' five films as the Saint has a double who happens to be a crime boss. The film does have some good moments, but in most places the movie seems kind of forced and silly and not in a good way.  Bela Lugosia can't even save this one.  In addition, the casting of the film's heroine and sidekick were the worst of the series. Grade: C-

The Saint Takes Over:  With Fernack framed for murder, the Saint once again journeys through the New York underworld but finds himself as a race against crime as potential witnesses who can save Fernack keep dying off. This film also presents the Saint with the toughest dilemma in his career and perhaps most downbeat ending in the series. Grade: A

The Saint in Palm Springs: Fernack asks the Saint to guard a $200,000 postage stamp for a friend and deliver it to Palm Springs. The friend is killed but the Saint is determined to ensure the stamp  reaches the dead man's heir. The Saint goes to Palm Springs determined to deliver the stamp and reveal the characters. Overall, this was a fun suspense story with something as tiny as a postage being the desired object, it was always a question as to where it was and who had it, as well as whodunit. The Saint shows a lot of cleverness, unfortunately he also shows a lot of stupidity as he exposes himself and others to unnecessary peril. Still, this was entertaining with a great reveal at the end. Grade: B

Overall, this was a very enjoyable collection and a great opportunity to see George Sanders at his best.  While the films aren't perfect, they are really enjoyable.",1390176000,9,4093,4.510148849797023

The GREAT thing about this series is that George is not cast as a supporting actor, rather the lead. So he has a lot of screen time and you are allowed the pleasure of his voice for many more scenes than are usually afforded him. The Saint's Double Trouble offers you even more bang for the buck. If you can prevent yourself from watching all of them at once, you're stronger willed than I am! I picked this up on sale for around $28. Better investment than any first-run Hollywood junk these days...",1383609600,6,769,4.384615384615385
4599701,4,B0058K88K6,"This compilation of five movies will provide you with hours of enormous pleasure. All five films were conceived as ""programmers,"" that is, productions with limited budgets, those filmed within a single month and sometimes shown as part of a double bill. Yet, they were significant enough to have been reviewed even by the august NY Times.

They retain our interest today due to the very competent acting and concisely written scripts. And what distinguishes these films apart from the plethora of other detective movies are some very unique elements. First and foremost is George Sanders as the Saint, who exhibits much bravado but who can also be humble, introspective, and even emotional. His blithe spirit and savoir faire actually belie a man who is capable of falling in love and even mourn the demise of others.

Secondly is the seamless blend of suspense, drama, and humor. In the midst of a chase or just prior to or after the death of an antagonist, there are bons mots galore, which nicely leaven the proceedings.

Thirdly, the appearances from film to film of the same actors and characters provide a rewarding continuity and familiarity.

Although all five films are very enjoyable, there are two which can be considered highlights: ""The Saint in London"" and ""The Saint Takes Over."" The first features a malapert and maladroit sparring partner for the Saint - portrayed by the beguiling actress Sally Gray. She eagerly and gamely ""assists"" the Saint, mostly to ill effect, and provides a nice foil. The other features a very vulnerable inspector who has lost his position due to the machinations of criminal elements. He requires the Saint to be rehabilitated professionally and is nicely acted by Jonathan Hale.

A final note: this about George Sanders. His filmic portrayal of villians (in ""Son of Fury,"" ""All About Eve,"" and many others) unfortunately supplants his sympathetic characters. For a greater perspective of his range, note his memorable roles in such fare as ""Foreign Correspondent,"" ""The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry,"" and even ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.""",1380067200,2,2083,5.061224489795919

Sanders is to the saint like connery is to james bond-he blows away everybody else that ever played the role.then i saw the 5 set collection and had to have it.it's even better than i thought at first and dvd quality is exceptionl.long live the saint!,1356912000,4,505,4.270833333333333

4599735,5,B0058K88K6,"FINALLY!, THE GREAT 'CAMPY' MYSTERIES! True Martinis and Movies Material. The Saint series are the initial mystery collection by George Sanders, the self described 'Cad', always with the proverbial Tongue in Cheek. The George Sanders smirk,a trademark gesture of his, is hillarious for those of use that appreciate a bit of cynicism. This collection provides great entertainment as Light 'who dun it' mystery dramas with comedic moments. Acceptable scripts, great character actors, production and several quotable, fun, one-liners. Add gowns by notable Renie, which add the designer-y, fashion aspect.

Update- The image & sound quality is good for the era. I have watched all of these with friends many times now, no complaints. Yes... I would LOVE to see Criterion remaster these, but...

TRIVIA NOTE:In The Saint Strikes Back, The opening scene goes to a New Year's party at a club in San Francisco. The drummer in that band is Gene Krupa, turning out the usual Krupa intense rhythms. Very early recording of him, although only maybe 3 min long.
Krupa also played in Ball of Fire, 1941, Barbara Stanwyk singing Drum Boogie.",1326240000,15,1126,5.147540983606557

The RKO Radio Pictures series starring George Sanders were well-made programmers featuring a blend of mystery, melodrama and comedy. I enjoyed them then and now for what they were - entertainment. The price is too high for this two-disc DVD-R (order it and then the DVD-R is burned - unlike mass marketed DVD movies).",1325635200,5,426,4.693333333333333

4599739,5,B0058K88K6,"This set includes all five movies with George Sanders as ""the Saint"", although you may be forgiven if you've confused some Saint and Falcon movies in your mind. He did three Falcon films later.

Sadly, the set includes no special features of any kind, and the movies are pretty short: 64, 77, 67, 67, and 66 minutes.

But Sanders is just great as the Saint and like the ""Thin Man"" movies, you'll enjoy re-watching these periodically just for the witty repartee.

These don't appear to be available elsewhere, and are ""out of stock"" as I write this in Oct. 2011, so  you might want to purchase this item sooner than later.
