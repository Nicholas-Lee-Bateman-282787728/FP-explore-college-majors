8377637,5,B002QBWS9W,"As sometimes happens with Qubec films, this one, initially released on DVD in some editions in French only with no English subtitles (or even none at all in either language), came out initially unilingually, but now that the passage of years has made ""J'ai tu ma mre"" (""I Killed My Mother"") internationally successful enough, a new edition (Kino Lobber K-1068) has appeared with the English subtitles included but with the dialogue still heard in French, as so many Anglophone viewers of non-English-language motion pictures prefer. In the U. K., of course, the film, with the dialogue still in French only and with the English subtitles, is available separately, too, for purchase but it also may be had as part of a compilation, along with Dolan's other films, ""Heartbeat"" (""Les Amours imaginaires"") and ""Laurence Anyways"", with some brief but welcome bonus features for two of the three movies. In the U. S. of A. and in the Dominion of Canada, however, that set of the three films together, collectively titled ""La Folie d'amour: the Xavier Dolan Collection"" (Network Releasing 7953852), with some brief bonus features included for two of the three films, has not come available yet (as of mid-2014) in a domestic edition using the North American video standard (NTSC), but it is available here and there as an import coded for PAL. It has been worth the wait, to say the least of it, to have the movies, in various choice options for the three of them, with the English subtitles included!

Only 25 at the time of this writing (2014), and only only 20 years old when ""J'ai tu ma mre"" was filmed and released, and this film is, at that (but before ""J'ai tu ma mre"", more limitedly as actor only), one of several films already to his credit by 2009, Xavier Dolan is an incredibly precocious cinematic genius. His artistry seems to have appeared, fully formed and functioning in all of the cinematic activities that his career embraces, right at the very outset of his career, accomplishing brilliantly all aspects of it simultaneously in ""J'ai tu ma mre""!

The film is quasi-autobiographical and, given how subjective its entire subject is, about the conflicted relationship of the teenaged boy (16, then 17 years old during the action) with his mother (and, in passing during a scene, with his estranged father, too), the film is marvellously and judiciously well paced and coherent. Dolan, who acts in the film as well as directs it and had written its screenplay, looks very much the lad in his late teens, even if he was slightly older than that at the time of the film; many young guys at 20 still are decidedly adolescent in appearance, as Dolan looks in this film.

Recounting the story line in great detail for Amazon seems rather pointless; there is a good entry, including numerous fine reviews, on the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb) that sum up and assess the film nicely. Most of the time Hubert (Dolan's role) is vituperatively at odds with his suburbanite, middle class mother, Chantale (acted by Anne Doral), who has to have (and does have) the patience of a female Job to deal with Hubert, but he has intermittent tender moments with her, too. Hubert's relationship with his teenage male paramour, Antonin (acted by Franois Arnaud, a sumptuously attractive lad himself at the age he was when making the film!), has attained mental maturity sooner than Hubert, but he still sizzles with gay teenage ardour, as Hubert does, in the lovers' sex scene together). Sometime folks forget that such early maturity as Antonin's can be a part of being human at that age. Niels Schneider, whose Apollonian fair, curly-headed blond, male loveliness were so astonishingly, achingly present in Dolan's film, ""Les Amours imaginaires"" (of 2010, the year following ""J'ai tu ma mre""), being, albeit in a different and contrasting sort of way, even more gorgeous than Dolan himself, plays the beautiful school chum, ric, who has a gay crush on Hubert at the Roman Catholic, rural boarding school to which Hubert's parents have sent him in order to deal with their son's obstreperous behaviour. Being the target of a gay-bashing incident there, in Magog, drives Hubert to run away from the boarding school, his patient mother finding him in the same locale as that of the opening of the film, where Dolan and Chantale had lived blissfully in Hubert's early childhood. Things turn out that it is Antonin, not ric, who holds Hubert's affection and loyalty, as, the viewer feels reassured at movie's end, does his own mother, despite the ruggd ways that the two have been traversing during Hubert's teen years.

The actors are all very fine, including, not mentioned so far, Hubert's caring school teacher, Julie (played by Julie Clment), at public school prior to Hubert's banishment to the Magog area's private school, and Antonin's mother, Hlne (acted by Patricia Tulasne), a more exuberant woman and readily accepting mother than Chantale is for Hubert. They and the rest of the cast are all very fine actors, totally believable.

Get this movie on DVD soon! Now that there is an U. K. edition in English, there is no longer any excuse to delay doing just that!",1406160000,,5161,4.880273660205245
