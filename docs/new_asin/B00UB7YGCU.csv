8705142,5,B00UB7YGCU,"The E-2 gang on the East side are a bunch of Hooligans who killed the wrong man (Steven Berkoff) in an alley. It seems he was part of an old gang from that neighborhood that has since retired. Upon hearing of his brother's murder, Richie (Ian Ogilvy) returns to the old neighborhood, revives what is left of his group as they enact revenge.

It seems there is a demand for old guys getting physical even when Stallone, Arnie, or De Niro aren't involved. I like this film. The acting was good, although Aaron (Danny-Boy Hatchard) looked far too stereo-typical with his hoodie and stretching his arms out like a rapper every time he speaks. There is a nicely added twist at about 50 minutes into the film which didn't add as much to the film as it could, but nonetheless made it more interesting.

The ending climax was a bit anti-climatic as I was hoping for something a little different. Better than the ""Harry Morgan"" vigilante film. Good crime drama.
