5091568,2,B007JLBVME,"This movie is very lame.  Horrible script, horrible writing and horrible acting.  Who wrote this thing?  It's so corny, and I do NOT mean that in a good or funny way.  The only redeeming quality is boobs right?  Well, then they should have at least had some hotter girls with better boobs.  The opening scene in the locker room is probably the highlight of the movie and it goes downhill from there.",1358467200,9,399,4.472222222222222
5091569,2,B007JLBVME,"As you could probably tell from the title, this is a pretty simplistic film.  The basic plot is a group of 5 ladies going to ""Band Nationals"" in Florida have their bus break down and run into a town that celebrates wild and raunchy spring break antics.

This movie aspires to such heights of other teen sex comedies as ""American Pie"" or even back to ""Porky's.""  However, though there are some chuckles, the film really isn't all that funny.  You will get some gratuitous nudity, but if you have any interest in anything other than that, you will likely be disappointed in this one.",1350518400,2,581,4.5576923076923075
5091570,5,B007JLBVME,"this was a great throwback movie. so much like the raunchy, funny, lighthearted movies of the 1980's.  in fact one of the characters could have been the daughter of the roxy character in 'hot t-shirts' !",1346889600,10,203,4.638888888888889
5091571,5,B007JLBVME,"I love watching movies with lots of topless part's, and trust there where plenty! The story was good and I would watch it again with a group of girls just to see the funny stoniest part's and plus the wet t. Shirt contest was pretty hot I must say, I do love them wet t. Shirt contest:) Sexy fun silly movie plus got to love sexy part's!",1345334400,,337,4.044776119402985
5091572,5,B007JLBVME,this is a good movie i loved watchin it and was funny at times and i really enjoyed one of the extra's that was in it in the wet tshirt part of the movie.,1345075200,,154,3.5588235294117645
5091573,3,B007JLBVME,"only reason I ordered the movie, was because a friend admitted to being in the movie.  she said it was an awful movie.  OK she didn't lie, but it was worth the money to watch her in it.  Im  planning on her watching it with me so I can get the inside scoop on the movie and watch her squirm alittle.  then im going to have her autograph it for me, because she is listed in the top ten characters in the end credits.",1435881600,3,415,3.892857142857143

5091578,4,B007JLBVME,"Ok this movie was better then i thought it would be. First it wasn't the greatest movie but had a great way of giving a,different way to tell a spingbreak story! If i was younger again i would ha e liked this movie better. But when you get older you watch them trying to remember your youth! Rent it and make up your own mind. I liked that it wasn't  about drugs and ppl killing ppl just kind of about these girls just trying to get to the finals.",1412899200,,447,4.022471910112359

5091582,4,B007JLBVME,"Finally--a film maker in 2012 makes a 70's skin and sun flick. Oh, the plot is, well, we've seen it before. Five beautiful girls from a junior college marching band head for Fort Lauderdale to compete in a band contest but get stranded in a little town and then look for ways to raise the money to continue. The movie is off to a good start with everyone topless in the locker room. There's only 5 girls in this band because we are told the rest flew on ahead. These 5 were traveling in a short school bus, supposedly carrying the band instruments. We only hear one note played, and only see one instrument, but heck, this is LOW budget. It's worth  watching just to see the beautiful Samantha Stewart wrestling topless in a tub of Jello. Oh yes, didn't you expect to see a wet T-shirt contest too.? Don't think it will win an Oscar, but it takes talent for actresses to act like actresses who can't act. Fun!",1358899200,18,909,4.347058823529411

8518355,1,B007JLBVME,"I'm usually the one that goes for the movies that suck but this one I just could not hack, it's bad!!!!
  really really bad even with tits It's still terrible. *The burning quality to make the disc really screwed the DVD up, there were absolutely no voices... all other sounds and music, but no voices. I tried watching it anyway to get an idea of what was happening but it was just God awful. Even if I could hear the voices it would not have made this movie any better.",1501632000,,471,4.222222222222222
8518356,4,B007JLBVME,"This is simply a teen (well, junior college) exploitation comedy, with a good serving of T & A.  It is FAR from the best of the breed, but has some hilarious scenes (notably the locker room at the beginning) and attractive stars from the usual Asylum stable.  If you like dumb sexy comedies, as I do, enjoy the film and don't be too critical.  If you insist on fine film making, skip this one.  There are some serious flaws, especially in continuity (I think they used three different-size school buses during the trip to Florida, and if you know your American geography you'll be amazed at the strange routing they take).  Finally, this DVD is a cut version.  I originally saw
Bikini Spring Break on one of the premium cable movie channels (Cinemax or Showtime??), and there are a few very noticeable deletions.  The DVD version has a toned-down locker room scene at the beginning (still hilarious, though), and all of Robert Carridine's adventures with the policewoman who stops him are gone.",1495670400,,994,4.744186046511628

8518360,1,B007JLBVME,"I like 80s movies, I like campy/goofy/adolescent comedies.  Figured this would be mindless entertainment but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

I'll just give one example...when showing a bus ride down the street, some shots are of a small (short) bus, and others are of a long school bus.  I even wish they did this on purpose but I suspect the film makers were just inept.",1444694400,,387,4.5
