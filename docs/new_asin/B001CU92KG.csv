8289777,3,B001CU92KG,"To most people that have just heard about this topic or are just now interested in studying it.  You should realize that the history channel has a way of watering down the truth of these events.

New information is being released about the true nature of this attack.  Basically world war 3 was intended to begin.... but because the israelis failed to sink the ship and KILL EVERYONE ON BOARD.... the plan flopped.  It was in the late 60's at the height of the vietnam war.

They were trying to start a huge war on multiple fronts.  We were supposed to be fighting in asia and the middle east.

I mean take what you want from this ""documentary"" but what should be the most important point is what if.... what if this plan followed through.  Could you have imagined the news that night.

""This just in, a US naval ship was attacked by ARAB/MUSLIM TERRORISTS.  They boarded the ship setting fires (napalm) and managed to detonate explosives on board (torpedo attack)sinking the ship and killing ALL ON BOARD""

Also, there is a story connected to this about how McNamara had called back an airplane that was scrambled to HELP the liberty.

That story is kind of a lie.  The model and type of airplane that was deployed was not a fighter, nor was it an airplane meant for defending ships on open water.  The plane that was recalled by McNamara was a BOMBER.... it was on its way to syria... when the liberty didn't sink they had to recall their plane and change the plan.......... THINK ABOUT IT!!!!",1349481600,5,1495,4.529850746268656
8289778,3,B001CU92KG,"This video is good but leaves out some very important things like the IDF blaming Egypt and the US sending a bomber towards Cairo to nuke it. finally someone in Israel grew a pair and admitted they were the attackers. if memory serves this was in the BBC DVD which I will now try to get

8289779,5,B001CU92KG,"As a teacher of U.S. History, this video kept me on the edge of my seat.  I had heard about this story from my father and found this video for him as he had never seen it, just read about it. The story of the sinking of the U.S.S. Liberty is heartbreaking and frustrating.  Heartbreaking in the senseless death that occurred; frustrating that this true story is being swept under the rug of people's memories.  There is no doubt that this situation occurred as described by the actual men that served aboard the ship.  What there should be is doubt towards the excuses made by the attacker, which seem more like a giant lie and cover up.  When I asked a friend of mine who is former NSA about this event, he told me ""there are still things I am not allowed to talk about.""  Hmmmm, how interesting.  I wish to thank the surviving veterans who have kept this story alive and served our nation with honor and dignity.  It is a shame that our country and an ally country let you down.  Thank God, some of you survived to tell this story that should anger any American.  This video is a MUST SEE!",1325376000,14,1091,4.303921568627451
8289780,5,B001CU92KG,"With this 60 minute film, CBS NEWS PRODUCTIONS has produced the best video story of the USS Liberty attack.  It was shown at least 50 times on THE HISTORY CHANNEL and deserves to be more widely seen.

A simple search within AMAZON.COM for USS LIBERTY provides easy links to the purchase of several books and videos on the subject, or one can visit the Liberty web site [...].",1246147200,15,375,4.5
