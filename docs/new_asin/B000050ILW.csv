1385978,5,B000050ILW,"Wow, Wow, Wow! You will not be disappointed at all with this old school flick!  You will see the top ten Venom Mob stars in this one.  They team up to deliver an awesome old school hit.  The fighting scenes are mob classics, nothing short here.  But hold your stomachs, because this is filled with major blood baths, gutts being spilled out and awesome hand to hand combat, sword and pole fighting scenes.  You will feature some of the best fighting scenes here.  This is typical of the mob classics that I'm used to.  This flick is filled with action all the way through.

The plot begins early with treachery, rivalry and trickery as the Venoms team up to guard one of their heroes and get him safely out of the country.  In the beginning, the Ten Tigers were tricked into fighting each other, thus giving into the plans of the evil officials.  Soon, they discover they were being tricked and used to lure their hero out in the open to be killed.  The Ten Tigers soon came together and planned their strategies for sneaking their hero out of the country.  Without giving too much away, they met up with strong opposition - from those seeking revenge to the crooked officials seeking to do away with the famous hero and kill off the Ten Tigers at the same time.  Those seeking revenge knew that they were no match for the Ten Tigers (together they were too strong) so they resorted to a scheme of trying to kill them off one by one by isolating them.  Alone, each Tiger was more manageable to deal with.

This flick is awesome and a must have for real Venom Mob fans.  This is worth having.  You can't go wrong!!!!",1145232000,3,1615,4.420338983050847
1385979,5,B000050ILW,"The Ten Tigers is actually based on a true story. Great use of Northern Styles, as well as forms and fighting based on the Southern Style 5 Animals system. Throw the Venoms in the Mix and you have a great Kung Fu Classic!!!",1132531200,,223,4.209302325581396

1385981,4,B000050ILW,"10 tigers is an enjoyable film.  If you're a Venom fan then you will be pleased to see the Poison Clan reunited in this movie. I thought the plot was good. An intricate tale of revenge and deception depicted through the use of many flashback sequences. Nevertheless, I thought the movie tended to drag a bit.  While some of the fight scenes seemed like they were put in just to add needless action at certain points.  However, the movie is still worth viewing.  I would actually give the film 31/2 stars.  With that said, I'm not upset that I purchased the movie because it does have some great fight sequences.",1054598400,2,611,4.5181818181818185
1385982,5,B000050ILW,"A classic of Old School chop sockey action, this one needs no introduction-- and anyway the hopelessly intertwined plot threads would make a synopsis sort of redundant.  If you're thinking of buying this one it's probably because you've already discovered Hong Kong and Shaw Brothers cinema, and possibly are even familiar with this gem.  Personal synopsis: A good print (though sadly not letterboxed) of one of the Shaw Studio's all-time greats.  Apart from the Venoms, it stars Shaw masters like Ti Lung and the late Alexander Fu Shing!  'Nuff said?",1014076800,2,551,5.088888888888889

1386014,3,B000050ILW,"I'll keep it simple.  The Tokyo Shock edition is well presented, but the movie is not very exciting and kind of hard to follow.  Too many characters, confusing scenarios set up the fights, and overall I didn't enjoy this film.  Tokyo Shock does a good job with their releases of classic Shaw Bros martial arts, but this film just isn't up to their usual standards.",1276905600,,364,4.569230769230769
1386015,4,B000050ILW,"According to more than one website, an on-set injury that waylaid Alexander Fu Sheng for a long time pretty much halted work on ""Ten Tigers"". Subsequently, a framing plot device (with many new actors, naturally) was used to complete the film. That said, this is still very good, and let it be noted on the bonus Chang Cheh ""Elegant Trails"" documentary that Tokyo Shock's translation is the BEST version of all those that are currently out on DVD: even BLURBS from old Cheh film reviews are translated! No commentary track, but, still, another great TS DVD, for fans of Fu Sheng and the Venoms.",1252022400,4,593,4.711538461538462
1386016,4,B000050ILW,"Although some critics have called this 1980 movie a Cheh mess make no mistake; this film is a classic~Ten Tigers of Kwangtung (Guangdong Shi Hu Xing Yi Wu Xi)~****.  It was supposed to be about the original ten Kwangtung Tigers and production originally started before ""Five Venoms"".  All the original Venoms, including the absent Wei Pai, Lo Mang & Wang Lung-Wei, are here, along with Ti Lung & Fu Sheng (both in lead roles and going toe-to-toe with the entire Venom team).  However, it's my guess that the completed footage was a little less than an hour, and that's why it was shelved.

Perhaps the reason why Chang decided to finish this film two years later was as a tribute to past performers Robert Tai, Ti Lung, Fu Sheng, Wang Lung-Wei, Tu Lung a.k.a. Ti ""Dick"" Wei, Ku Feng, Wei Pai, Lo Mang & Robert Yang who all left Chang's gang to work with other directors and other studios.  Chang completed it by making the 1978 footage a flashback, culminating in an awesome climatic martial duel between Ti Lung & Wang Lung-Wei (which was the original end fight, no doubt) who busts out a real esoteric weapon called the ""Mermaid's Tail"".  The footage that padded out the running time to 90 minutes involved the new Opera guys playing the descendants of the Kwangtung Tigers.  The story concerned their feud with the cousins & son of the Wang Lung-Wei character.

The final fight, which took place in a casino, was an excellent free-for-all displaying the talents of Lung Tien-Sheng, Chien Hsiao-Hao, director Lo Mar regular Kuan Feng and Wang Li.  Kuo Chui & Lu Feng drop by to add to the martial mayhem which had plenty of bloodshed & heroism.  Here was a movie that combined the original & ""new"" Venoms (Baby Venoms), and contained all of Chang Cheh's vintage traits including revenge, brotherhood, patriotism, loyalty, copious bloodshed and having heroes die in battle.

Robert Tai Che & Liang Ting choreograph the flashback stuff (mostly hand to hand), while Lu Feng, Kuo Chui & Chiang Sheng choreograph the ""present day"" stuff that bookends the movie (mostly weapons).  I use the term ""present day"" with a grain of salt, it's a period piece.  Tokyo Shock did a superb job with the Celestial transfer.  Remastered picture & subtitles (hey Shaw fans, isn't this awesome), Chinese audio or the decent English dub, the original HK trailer, the new Celestial transfer & an informative (and long overdue) documentary on the ""maestro"" himself, Chang Cheh, which can also be found on ""The Water Margin"" & ""The Heroic Ones"" DVDs.  Just one tiny flaw; although the English mono dub is the way it should be, the English 5.1 track has a different (and vastly inferior) music track.  It's as if some idiot made an attempt to re-do the original stock music.  Oh well, like I said, it's a tiny flaw.  Shaw/Venom/Fu fans, you know who you are, buy this.  Can't wait for ""Flag of Iron"".",1248048000,6,2876,4.738955823293173
1386017,2,B000050ILW,"This picture has way to many characters in it. I really didn't find the fighting scenes very good to be honest. A ton of punches with very little kicks or other moves. A lot of fights,but most were very short and were over before you could really enjoy them. The weapon based battles were good,but not enough to carry the film. One of the weaker shaw brother film which is hard to understand with so many cool stars in it. The only person I really though did some cool moves was sun chien. I can't suggest buying this one to anybody. Buy five deadly venoms,crippled avengers,heaven and hell gate or two champions of shaolin over this.",1245110400,,634,4.474137931034483
1386018,4,B000050ILW,"I just finished the new Tokyo Shock dvd, and this is definitely a must-see for any fan of Shaw Brothers movies.  There's a really high quantity of action spread throughout involving a huge cast, even if they often fought for dumb reasons.  No way I could keep track of all those names.  I hadn't seen a story presented like this yet.  The tale of the titular Ten Tigers was like a short, 50-60 minute movie of its own.  It's told as what had happened in the past, perhaps 20 years earlier, by the students/children of the Ten Tigers who are now being hunted for revenge as the result of actions of the past.  I feel terrible for not knowing these names but there's a fight about 70 minutes in that might be the best I've ever seen in a Shaw Brothers movie, at least for one on one.  The main villain for the ""future"" part of the film uses maybe 4 weapons, all hidden on him somewhere, and his opponent could turn anything into a weapon and has a counter for everything.  Ti Lung anchors the cast in the ""past"" and Philip Kwok spans both eras, showing some amazing weapon skills early on.  The Alexander Fu Sheng character would have been unbearably annoying if anyone else played him, but he was perfect.

The dvd actually has mono tracks in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, plus a 5.1 English dub.  There's a documentary on director Chang Cheh that I liked but had already seen on another of these dvds somewhere... There are also 6 trailers, 2 for this movie and 4 for other Shaw Brothers movies.",1244419200,7,1499,4.434306569343065
1386019,2,B000050ILW,"Disappointing, to say the least.  A wonderful cast that includes Ti Lung, Alexander Fu Sheng, all 6 Venoms, and a bunch more Shaw Brothers' performers that you aficionados will recognize.  Then why is it not very good?  The characters are annoying (especially Fu Sheng), the fights are slow (though plentiful, and they do eventually get better), and it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  After it was over, I was like, ""huh?""  They introduce character after character, and then get into fight after fight, and keeping up with it becomes rather arduous.

It is interesting that most of the Venoms play against type, at least at first.  Lu Feng, Wei Pai, and Sun Chien become friends with Ti Lung.  Then Philip Kwok, Chiang Sheng, and Lo Meng are all dished some red herring and try to harass the good guys.  There is also a group of young men that frequent the pawn shop that Ti Lung owns, who have a big fight at the end. No, our heroes don't fight during the film's climax, these kids do.

The version I have is distributed by Bonzai Media and is beautifully restored and remastered.  Yet still no one has touched ""Kid With the Golden Arm""!  I should probably give this another shot, but it bothers me that I feel that I should.  I can't recommend the movie as a whole.  However, near the end, there are some particularly good fights.  Maybe if you tried turning down the sound and synchronizing music to scenes and dialogue a la ""Wizard of Oz/Pink Floyd"", that could be worth an extra star.  2 or 3 if it works.

1386021,5,B000050ILW,"What I have noticed about this flick,,,it has several names.  The original name for this flick is "" 10 tigers From Kwangtung"",(SEE DETAILS IN GOOGLE.COM) ""10 Tigers From Kwingtung"",AKA ""10 Tigers from shaolin"".  When this movie was reviewed under the original name,"" 10 tigers From Kwangtung"",it got a 5 star, and when reviewed under the name ""10 Tigers from Shaolin"",,it only got 3 stars.  Now this is a little disconcerting to me as it appears most people, SO CALLED KUNG FU LOVERS tend grade or rate movies, based on what others have to say!  That is extremely sad I think, since I usually buy kung fu movies based on my Amazon colleagues!!  THIS MOVIE OVER-ALL WAS AMAZING, and deserve nothing less than 5 stars. I recommend it highly!!

7929059,3,B000050ILW,"Fun but it can drag a bit in the middle. It's a revenge/slash revolution , basically every other Kung Fu flick. It starts with some local boys drunk at the gambling parlor rebel rousing when some suspicious characters come in, the guard puts them in s backroom to sleep it off. The guard is a friend who has history with revellers but now isolated the nefarious characters plot and kill the guard and leave a bloody message for the party boys. From here we go into flashbacks and learn that this is decades old vendetta.",1457827200,,520,4.484210526315789
