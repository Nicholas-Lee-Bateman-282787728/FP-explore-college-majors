7943378,4,B00005KH37,"Ah, there's that stirring fanfare from the Shaw Brothers banner introducing yet another of director Lau Kar-Leung's masterful kung fu pictures. 1976's DIRTY HO - which, if you go by the title, isn't as urban exploitation cinema as you'd think - is touted as a comedy which showcases wicked good martial arts sequences. As an added point of interest, its star Gordon Liu also sports a mustache. As always, director Lau Kar-Leung's trademark intro fight demo during the opening credits gets the film off on a promising start.

The plot takes a page from that old conceit concerning the king disguising himself as a common man and walking the streets amongst his unsuspecting subjects. Gordon Liu plays the Eleventh Son of (and potential successor to) the reigning Emperor. He is traveling incognito in order to indulge his love of antiques and wine and also to sniff out which of his royal brothers is attempting to assassinate him. Passing himself off as a jewelry merchant, the Eleventh Son continually crosses paths with a scoundrel named Ho Jen (Wong Yue) and although they match wits, the royal prince finds Ho a likable dude. He maneuvers to have Ho become his martial arts student. This is one of the few times in which Gordon Liu plays the sifu. He's usually the headstrong pupil.

Maybe the coolest bit about this film is that the Eleventh Son has to hide his kung fu skills to maintain his cover. This allows Lau Kar-Leung opportunities to stage several marvelously choreographed action set pieces in which Gordon Liu has to fight while camouflaging his kung fu. In one memorable sequence he manipulates a bewildered Kara Hui's limbs to fend off Ho's attack, stating that she is his bodyguard. Two other dazzling disguised fights take place in, respectively, a winery (as Gordon goes up against Johnny Wang and Hsiao Hou) and in an antiques shop.

Wong Yue's character of ""Dirty Ho"" starts out as a buffoon with raw knowledge of kung fu, although he does handle his business early in the film when he goes up against a gang of cripples. His kung fu improves dramatically under the prince's tutelage, and we get to see another interesting training montage. The film's third act is an action-packed masterpiece, with Ho seamlessly work in tandem with the injured Eleventh Son as they engage hordes of assassins and confront the film's big bad (Lo Lieh's evil general). Lau Kar-Leung rarely disappoints with his films' climactic battles, and this is another doozy.

There is some good comedy here, and also some really broad, silly comedy. I guess there's no escaping the stereotypical swishy henchman in classic kung fu cinema, although the rest of the Seven Tigresses are pretty cool (a thuggish crew which includes a biter, a slapper, and an aggressive pourer of bitter tea).

This is a bare bones DVD, with English dubbing as the only option. If there's a DVD version of DIRTY HO out there with the original Chinese or Mandarin language but with English sub-titles, I wish someone would give a holler.",1319241600,,3010,4.859649122807017
7943379,4,B00005KH37,"Gordon Liu plays Mr. Wang, an art, jewelry, and wine afficionado who is travelling across China.  He encouters Mr. Ho a jewel thief in a crazy party competition (as in who can attract the most girls to their party).  These two continue to run into each other.  Ho is wanting to get back at Wang, and Wang apparently thinks Ho is amusing.  There is more to the plot, but you will have to watch the movie.
The fight scenes were very well done.  There was a really cool fight between Ho and Wang where Wang was using a female musician to actually do the battle, but Ho couldn't see what was happening and thought that she was actually very skilled in kung fu.  Really well done!
There were a number of encounters between Wang and various assassins.  For some reasons these assassins did not just up and start wailing on Wang, they were carrying on normal conversations and steathily fighting under the table.  Ho, who was present at these encounters had no idea that Wang was actually fighting!  Also very cool!
The sound and video quality was pretty good overall.  The dubbed voices were a bit corny in places, but that is to be expected.  There was a bit of noise from time to time (it looked like tracking problems from a VHS), but this was on the DVD.  Nothing that harmed the movie anyway.
This was a pretty good one if you want to see some unusual hidden combat.",1008374400,5,1365,4.416
7943380,4,B00005KH37,"DIRTY HO (1979) is a successful attempt by director Lau Kar Leung to bring fresh touches to the kung fu genre. Here he has his hero, the 11th Prince, practice a form of ""stealth"" kung fu in which he fights off assassination attempts with cleverly disguised kung fu moves while engaged in more mundane activities, such as wine tasting and antiques appraising. Disguised as a merchant named Wang, the prince has to keep his identity hidden, even from his newly enlisted sidekick, ""Dirty Ho,"" a petty thief and con man, until he can determine which of his brothers is trying to kill him. Only then can he undertake to share his kung fu skills with Ho in preparation for a grueling final battle with kung fu great Lo Lieh (FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH).
The stars are Gordon Liu (MASTER KILLER) and Wong Yue (YOUNG AVENGER), who had earlier teamed up in the enjoyable kung fu comedy, HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU (1977), directed by Lau Kar Wing, the brother of Lau Kar Leung. Also in the cast are kung fu regulars Wang Lung Wei and Kara Hui Ying Hung. The comic elements are seamlessly blended into the more serious story, creating an enjoyable if slightly far-fetched kung fu tale that lacks the excitement and intensity of Lau's other works, but boasts a high degree of charm. In addition, the film is very well mounted, shot on beautifully appointed studio sets, elegantly costumed, and well scored with original Chinese music. The version currently available is letter-boxed, enabling viewers to appreciate the full scope of the kung fu action.",1006646400,3,1536,4.735074626865671
7943381,4,B00005KH37,"No, this isn't a movie about a streetwalker with questionable bathing habits, its a hilarious kung-fu comedy. When you think of of Shaw Brothers martial arts films from the 60s and 70s, you sometimes think of unintentionally funny, dubbed fight fests; here is a wonderfully intentionally funny worth watching more than once.
You don't have to be a kung-fu expert to appreciate the witty, inventive fight choreograpy on display here.  If you think Jackie Chan was the only kung-fu action star to use humor in 1970s martial arts films, think again.  Here, the action is more economical, but is just a satisfying as many of Chan's.  The early confrontations between incognito Prince Eleven, and thief, Ho are sly and reveals the men's differing characters.  Some of the later fights are absolutely surreal, such as that fought during a wine tasting (I kid you not!)
If one thing remains in the memory, it's how good the team of director Lau Kar Leung and actor/martial artist Lau Kar Fai (aka Gordon Liu, the directors half-brother) was.  You might want to watch their more serious Shaolin Master Killer (aka The 36th Chamber) after seeing this, to see how good ""old school"" kung-fu films can be.
Please note, while this is a fun, rewarding film, the source for the DVD transfer was a less than perfect--make that much less than perfect--video tape.  Also note that it's dubbed, but the dubbing actually adds a bit to the fun, since this is essentially a comic tale. That being said, at this price you can't go wrong.",994032000,2,1514,4.803846153846154
