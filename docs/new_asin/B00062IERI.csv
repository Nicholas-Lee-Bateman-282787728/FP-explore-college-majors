8037645,3,B00062IERI,"I bought this movie because Ryan Kwanten is in it. I love his work on True Blood and am anxious to see him in everything else he does - he is a great actor! I hadn't heard of this movie before, but the price was great and has Ryan Kwanten starring so I bought it. I didn't read the summary of the movie, so I was quite surprised with all of the turns this movie makes. I thought Ryan was great, and it certainly is not your typical surf movie. Very interesting!",1303948800,,461,4.021739130434782
8037646,2,B00062IERI,"Beautiful Waves, and the French gal could likely have her way with me. Other than that, you cannot believe how bad this film is. If you can view Liquid Bridge as a comedy, it's actually pretty good. Hey, I watched the whole thing! It's got more plot twists and turns than a grinder at Rincon. Pretty radical stuff. The lead character and his development is so unbelievable, again, gotta go for the comedy eyes. Some really beautiful surf photography though, I must admit. There will be times, however, when you will say, ""I can't believe I'm sitting here and watching this thing......how could they?"" Aloha.",1106697600,7,607,4.79047619047619
