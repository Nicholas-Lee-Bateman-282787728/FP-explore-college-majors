8164676,4,B000LWBQVO,"This is an excellent documentary of arctic wildlife featuring the polar bears and other wildlife. It was shown on PBS' Nature and is narrated by George Page, who created and hosted that series for many years. The scenes of  polar bears, foxes, and other animals and birds remind me of the great TV specials with incredible wildlife photography that National Geographic made years ago. This is a shortened one hour version of the three part special which was broadcast on PBS in the 1990's. It's well worth seeing, but it would be nice to have the film in its entire length.  A short clip from that longer version is included on the special  ""The Best of Nature-- 25 Years"", which is available on DVD. Unfortunately this documentary, ""Kingdom of the Ice Bear"", like so many of the older Nature programs, is not available on DVD. As a product made available only on VHS, I gave it four stars, but the original three hour documentary deserves a five star rating.",1206662400,3,959,4.662721893491124
