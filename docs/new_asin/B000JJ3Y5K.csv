8150523,5,B000JJ3Y5K,Not one boring second... wow. This project is the best I've seen on tarpon. No question.  It's full of info and some massive fish - and I'd never seen a tarpon school from a helicopter. Killer stuff.,1249171200,,199,4.378378378378378
8150524,4,B000JJ3Y5K,"Not action packed, more like episodes, have to watch the men not only catch fish, but chat about it before hand and after the catch. kinda was tedious for me being a non enthusiast of tarpon.",1244160000,,191,4.333333333333333
8150525,5,B000JJ3Y5K,"I caught this show when it first aired on TV, and now I can't get enough of the DVD.  It's a great disc to throw in on a cold winter day when I sit down at the vise.  It definitely gets me hyped to head out on the water.

I especially enjoyed this DVD since I don't often get the chance to see fish larger than 80 lbs landed on a fly rod.  What's not to like big fish, warm water, and great cinematography.",1236470400,,406,3.7976190476190474
8150526,3,B000JJ3Y5K,"Chasing Silver has better than average photography, but drags in a lot of places and uses some inexperienced actors.  I shared the video with a bunch of my fishing buddies and everyone enjoyed the material.  However, there were frequent groans and russeling of ice cubes when the same sequences kept showing up episode after episode.  There was also  impatience when we learned that some of the main characters were nothing more than average guys with a tarpon addiction.  The interviews with Billy Pate weren't anything special and a bit disappointing,given he is a legend in fly fishing circles.  Good concept/ needs professional help.",1191974400,4,637,5.135922330097087
8150527,2,B000JJ3Y5K,"""The Endless Summer"" of tarpon fishing.

The series is visually stunning and will have great appeal to Midwest trout fishermen as they freeze their Orvis clad buttocks vicariously following several tarpon fisherman around Florida.

This would be an enjoyable way to spend a snowbound Sunday afternoon, if not for the inclusion of Andy Mill.

Andy, the ex-snow skier and equally ex-husband of Chris Everett, is showcased in a bizarre segment on innovative rod handling and tackle preparation yet manages to lose fish after fish, curse (bleeped out) each one and finally catch 1 fish in 24 hookups during the whole duration of shooting.

He then goes on in the special features segment about a new very large barbed gaff he invented so that he may not lose a fish boat side.

We realize that Mr. Mills is a newcomer to the sport, but gaffing large tarpon (a catch and release species) damages the fish's ability to feed itself (it's a suction feeder) as the gaff punctures the membrane in its mouth.

The bad thing about it is that this is presented as an instructional video.

All in all it was an ok video, but I am very sorry I spent $46 bucks on it.  Word to the wise.
