6565513,4,B00MA1503E,"I am not a scholar of the SOE but a regular person who has found reading about it fascinating. I've read biographies of Szabo, Atkins, Yeo-Thomas, and more (some of those books long out of print) and, most informative, Leo Marks' autobiographical book.  Some of what this presents matches most of what I have read, though it is difficult to say exactly what the truth is, partly because of the Official secrets Act and its effect on contemporary reports , and partly because different people tell the story in different ways. Mostly, though , I think the failures here come from trying to create a single coherent narrative in a short time as 55 minutes. We none of us are simple people, and none of us really have a coherent narrative. Nor did Noor.

Noor was a bundle of conflicting traits. She came very close to washing out of spy training, and only the desperation of the SOE led to her being assigned. She did much better than anyone had any hope of her doing, and she and all the SOE agents were brave upon capture in a way I cannot help but think I could never be. They stood up to tortures that I have read about but Amazon probably wouldn't let me post here, but did not break. We do not know what happened to her in the concentration camp, but anyone who has read extensively about the camps can imagine. That such a self-effacing woman, a poet, ended up being so tough under interrogation really makes you think about the nature of bravery. (it wasn't the polite discussion shown here)

It is good that people in England recognize a Muslim woman for being a hero, And on the whole, it is better that this biography exist then nothing exist about her, but it is not a perfect bio. I second what another reviewer said and that is if you are interested in spy work in World War II that you should definitely hunt down Carve Her Name with Pride, about Szabo, which for a biopic is pretty accurate - and a real tear-jerker. And definitely read the Leo Marks book.",1507939200,,1970,4.421487603305785

6565538,4,B00MA1503E,"Even before seeing this PBS docudrama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-of-the-Reich/dp/B00NG0UX76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy of the Reich</a>&nbsp;I've been very interested in the subject of Noor Inayat Khan, the first female radio operator to be sent from Britain into Nazi-occupied France to aid the French Resistance.

Both being of Indian descent like Noor (though UNLIKE Noor, both my parents are from India) as well as having a lifelong interest in the ""European Theater"" of World War II, and especially the Holocaust, I've been fascinated by Noor Inayat Khan, ever since I found out about her.

Born in 1914 in St. Petersburg, Russia to an Indian father, and American mother, Noor Inayat Khan was raised in England and France as the eldest of four children. She grew up a creative, dreamy child, surrounded by brilliant minds and heavily influenced by her father's peaceful nature. Noor's father, Hazrat Inayat Khan, came from a noble Indian Muslim family -- Hazrat's mother was a descendant of the uncle of Tipu Sultan, the 18th-century ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hazrat  was the founder of The Sufi Order in the West in 1914 (London) and teacher of Universal Sufism. He initially came to the West as a Northern Indian classical musician, having received the honorific ""Tansen"" from the Nizam of Hyderabad, but he soon turned to the introduction and transmission of Sufi thought & practice, living in Europe as a musician and a teacher of Sufism. Noor's mother mother Ameena Begum (formerly Ora Meena Ray Baker) was an American from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who met Hazrat Inayat Khan during his travels in the United States. Ora Baker was the half-sister of American yogi and scholar Pierre Bernard, her guardian at the time she met Inayat and is also said to be related to Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science movement. After Hazrat Inayat Khan died in 1927 when Noor was just 13, she took on the responsibility for caring for her grief-stricken mother and her younger siblings. As a young girl, she was described as quiet, shy, sensitive, and dreamy, she studied child psychology at the Sorbonne and music at the Paris Conservatory under Nadia Boulanger, composing for harp and piano. She began a career writing poetry and children's stories and became a regular contributor to children's magazines and French radio. In 1939 her book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twenty-Jataka-Tales/dp/0892813237/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twenty Jataka Tales</a>&nbsp;(ISBN 978-0892813230), inspired by the Jataka tales of Buddhist tradition, was published in London.

After the outbreak of World War II when France was overrun by German troops, the family fled to Bordeaux and, from there by sea, to England, landing in Falmouth, Cornwall, on 22 June 1940. Although Noor & her siblings were were raised as pacifists in the Sufi traditions of her father, and Noor was deeply influenced by her father's pacifist/Sufi teachings, she was jolted by the violence that surrounded her and constantly drew on her father's lessons of peace and acceptance before deciding she had to take more drastic action, and she and her brother Vilayat decided to help defeat Nazi tyranny. Contrary of what you would think of an ethereal girl coming face to face with this war, she didn't shy away from it. She felt it was her duty to step up, so in November 1940, Noor joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and, as an Aircraftwoman 2nd Class, was sent to be trained as a wireless operator. Later, Noor Inayat Khan was recruited as an SOE (Special Operations Executive) agent for the F (France) Section, adopting the name ""Nora Baker"" during her training. In June 1943, she was sent into Nazi-occupied France to work in Paris as a British agent transmitting wireless/radio messages to help the Resistance.

When people think of World War II heroes, very few think of Noor Inayat Khan, a Muslim woman in her late 20s who epitomized courage serving as a British secret agent in one of the most dangerous jobs a woman could have, as a wireless radio operator in Nazi-occupied Paris. But Noor Inayat Khan IS a hero, and when her entire operation was compromised, Ms. Khan was one of the last people left in her unit -- but she refused to back down or flee France to return to the safety of England and continued to gather & transmit information on the Nazi regime.

I'm not going to post any ""spoilers"" that says what happens (although anyone with the ability to Google or Wikipedia can easily find out, anyway!) but though this is a pretty good biographical docudrama about Noor Inayat Khan, it DEFINITELY could have been done better.

At a runtime of only 55 minutes, it was too rushed, and did NOT go into any kind of depth whatsoever into the life of Noor Inayat Khan. It was all just basic information, and aside from the interviews with her living relatives, there was nothing I learned from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-of-the-Reich/dp/B00NG0UX76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy of the Reich</a>&nbsp;that I hadn't already known before. Nothing new, that couldn't be gotten in half (or a larger fraction of) the time by Googling. I really wish that this film had gone into more detail about Noor's life, including and especially her time in Nazi-occupied France. The whole movie was just way too rushed and abrupt, almost like the producer's primary concern was just to finish the film and be done with it, rather than actually going into any detail and getting to the ""meat"" of her story and life.

Having said that though, this is still a pretty good film. The casting, including the narration of Helen Mirren, and especially the choice of Grace Srinivasan as Noor, is EXCELLENT!

Given that Noor Inayat Khan was born to an Indian father, and an American mother, I imagine it'd be pretty difficult to find an actress with the same ethnic background who resembles Noor as closely enough as possible. Yet they were able to accomplish that with the casting of Grace Srinivasan. A graduate of George Washington University (B.A. '13) Grace Srinivasan is the daughter of an Indian father and an American mother -- just like Noor Inayat Khan. Ms. Srinivasan said that while the film vividly depicts Ms. Khan's story, it is a documentary at its core. Historians contextualize the war and two of Ms. Khan's nephews are featured prominently--including one who has become a Sufi leader, similar to Ms. Khan's father, and enlightens the audience by talking about the spiritual teachings Ms. Khan learned as a girl.

""You get all the information that goes along with this beautifully shot, movie-like reenactment portion of the film. It balances well without being overwhelming, which makes it watchable,"" Ms. Srinivasan said.

Although Grace didn't know much about Noor's heroic life, once she'd done more research on Ms. Khan's bravery, she knew she wanted the part. ""She was unbelievable. She was only in her 20s and by all accounts, she's this beautiful Indian woman who couldn't exactly blend in, but she kept radioing for as long as she could,"" Ms. Srinivasan said. ""It's this fascinating story no one knows, and one that definitely needed to be told.""

Which is especially why its so disappointing that the producers of this film didn't tell MORE. I would have liked to know a LOT more about Noor's early life, and her time in Nazi-occupied Paris and afterwards.

Unfortunately, this film neglected all that, just skating by on the surface information. For those just starting to learn about, and especially for those with just a topical interest in World War II, or SOE and the French Resistance, or even Noor Inayat Khan herself, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-of-the-Reich-The-Noor-Inayat-Khan-Story/dp/B00NG0UX76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story</a>&nbsp;is definitely a good place to BEGIN.

But for those like me, who already knew all the basics about Noor Inayat Khan, and were looking for MORE depth, this film was disappointing because with just a little more time and effort, it could have been a LOT better.

In my honest opinion, a good example of the lack of information in this film would be a comparison between the original 1950s film of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary-of-Anne-Frank/dp/B001XJBE16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary of Anne Frank</a>&nbsp;with Millie Perkins which only focused on the period Anne & her family spent in hiding and little to nothing before, and nothing afterwards, as opposed to the 2001 miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Frank-The-Whole-Story/dp/B00005LC5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Frank - The Whole Story</a>&nbsp;with Ben Kingsley & Hannah Taylor-Gordon, which not only showed Anne's life for a few years before the war and going into hiding as well as showed the last 7 months of her life in the concentration camps after Anne's ""Secret Annexe"" was raided, and she & the 7 other people in hiding with her (her family, the vanPels family, and Fritz Pfeffer) were arrested and with the exception of Otto Frank, Anne's father who was the only survivor from the Secret Annexe, were all deported to their deaths in the camps.

Basically this film is too short, and would have been much better if they'd been able to go into more depth & detail, by making it a regular 2 hour movie, instead of a 55 minute program!

6565559,5,B00MA1503E,"THIS IS SO GOOD ... about a woman with British mother and Indian father who was raised in Paris. A brilliant young woman whose father died while she was young, and who escaped early into London to avoid the Nazi occupation of France, and was subsequently recruited and trained by British Intelligence as essentially a teletype (or Morse Code) dispatcher to transmit communications in code to and from the French underground resistance in Paris during the War (World War II). She was flown into France near Paris at night in a small plane and left there with her teletype machine to work with the French underground resistance to coordinate EVERYTHING between them and Great Britain: supplies, weapons, people, plans and documents, activities -- ALL against Adolph Hitler and the German Nazis and Gestapo occupying France!

But when things got extra risky and tough for her in Paris, she of course was on the run and in emergency hiding to continue her activities ... although the was ""called home"" to London by British Intelligence ... but refused to go, to leave Paris and those of the resistance there depending solely upon her for their safety and continuance of their resistance activities.

Unfortunately, however, she was captured by the German Gestapo in Paris, refused to cooperate with them, was sent to a Nazi concentration camp and subsequently executed at point blank range by a bullet to the back of her head, while kneeling on the ground.

After the war, she was eulogized in Great Britain as a National Hero (or Heroine)!

If you want to see bravery by a young woman at its best during the War, and see how the French resistance in Paris operated -- and the punishment of those caught as meted out by the Gestapo -- this is the one for you!

The moral? Honesty, do what you can to help, and love (of something, someone, or both). Because there is nothing else!",1430352000,6,1875,4.756923076923077

Based upon other reading I have done, Noor was certainly mystical, but she was also a young woman responding to the pressures and excitement of war and being on a secret mission.  She may have had an affair and may have been engaged once.  It would not have harmed the narrative to mention this as it would have only heightened the fact that she had a whole spectrum of emotions to deal with.

In any case, her personal life does not detract at all from her fearless resistance after capture.  She tried to escape twice and fought like a demon against her captors.  One documentary claims she was actually beaten to death at Dachau, rather than being shot.  Through it all, she never revealed any information.  She was certainly deserving of the George Medal and being mentioned in the same breadth with Violette Szabo, Pearl Witherington, Nancy Wake, and the other heroines of F Section.  A final point.  While the position of wireless operator was inherently dangerous, the documentary needlessly downplays the importance of organizers and couriers.  Noor could never have taken over a French Maquis organization like Nancy Wake did.  Nor could she have negotiated with the Germans for the life of captured agents as Christina Manville did.  Noor's strength laid in different places.  Thus, at the end of the day, we must come back to the simple fact that a woman at least superficially unfitted to play an important role in a dangerous environment, willingly volunteered,  participated, and knowingly risked her life for the principles she held sacred.",1415404800,24,1989,4.863095238095238

This partially dramatized documentary is really an amazing story of the like not often told in Western media and cinema.  It is the story of Noor Inayat Khan, born to Indian/American parents in Moscow and raised between London and an area near Paris France.  Her father was Hazrat Inayat Khan, founder of The Sufi Order in the West in 1914 (London) and teacher of Universal Sufism.  He was born to a noble Muslim Indian family.  Her mother was Meena Ray Baker, an American woman he met during his travels.  This documentary is heavy on dramatized scenes that make it more interesting and relatable.  However, there is also a huge amount of narration which often overlaps the scenes of dramatization.  Interspersed are a number of interviews from other members of Inayat's family descendants.

THE STORY:  Though this is a matter of history, many Americans will not be familiar with this tale so I won't say too much so you can discover this terrific and inspiring story for yourselves.  The docudrama mainly picks up with a little background and then the volunteer enlistment of Noor into the British Military (Women's Aux Air Service) as a wireless operator.  She is eventually recruited into the Special Operations Executive because of her language skills, but essentially flunks one of the courses because of her lack of focus in some areas and propensity for always telling the truth (not good spy material).  One of the officers recognizes a special quality in Noor and facilitates her continuation in the program and deployment into occupied France.  Her ultimate determination and moral strength, inspired by her Sufi Muslim faith, will provide a resolve that supports her in adversity to pick up the pieces where others fail or are betrayed.  For those who may consider skipping this because of the religious reference, I suggest this story is very engaging as one of the great WWII spy intrigues of the kind you just doesn't hear every day.  It's worth it for that alone and more.  The events that propel her to the foreground of SOE efforts in France just after her arrival are amazing.  Noor wasn't perfect, but no hero or heroine ever is.  For the most part this show is quite fair (mentioning a few faults) while still doing her honor.  Her feistiness and even leadership in the face of disaster were extraordinary.

She was later awarded the George Cross",1413849600,17,2472,4.894230769230769

8671047,2,B00MA1503E,"Put a swastika on anything and it turns into click-bait. I still don't understand what she did that was so special, other than having brown skin and an exotic name. Seriously? She deserves this kind of recognition because of that?  Many other vanilla skinned men and women died doing the same thing, yet they get no special recognition.

In our evolving globalist zeitgeist, the expansion of multi-culturalism seems to have created a need for portraits such as this. Because after all, we wouldn't want non-whites to feel left out of the greatest historical event in contemporary history. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful idea to highlight subjects like Muslims serving under the swastika, French African colonial troops defending Paris, black American units that saw combat (and Japanese Americans), etc. Some of these stories are known more than others, like the Native American code-talkers serving in the Pacific theater. However, certain topics (like this woman's story) are just sensationalized melodrama. It creates an urban legend simply because she was different...not because she did something extraordinary. The dramatic cover doesn't help much either.

Let's be real: she withstood Nazi interrogation for three weeks, likely without any form of torture because she was a woman. That alone does NOT make her a hero. Besides, she ultimately failed her mission. We are told that she had strong spiritual beliefs and refused to lie. That almost sounds more like arrogant insubordination, or what we now call the 'snowflake' syndrome. And it goes without saying that sometimes being stubborn, self-righteous, or head-strong can be confused with heroism or being 'patriotic'.

I'm not going to deny that she did her duty, but I don't think she deserves this level of attention. The production value is good, the reenactments are decent, and the interviewees are obviously sympathetic to her. Check it out if you need a WW2 diversity fix.",1529712000,,1948,5.214057507987221
