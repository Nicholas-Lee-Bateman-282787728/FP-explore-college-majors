7965375,5,B0000696I4,"I got this DVD just in time for Halloween and it is a great set of episodes to have for the holiday. The two Halloween specific episodes (Spooky Fish & Korn's Groovy Pirate Mystery) were great and I loved Underpants Gnomes; Trapper Keeper is probably the weakest episode on the disc, but my friends and I were still entertained. I hadn't expected too much from the older episodes as far as transfer quality, but the colors and sound are good all around. I paid less than $10 and it was definitely worth it.",1352764800,,506,4.451612903225806
7965376,5,B0000696I4,"This is one of the best South Park DVDs out right now. This is what I rate the Episodes.
Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Ride: 4
Spookyfish: 4
Gnomes: 5
Trapper Keeper: 4 1/2
As you can see, Gnomes is my favorite episode. As you know there are canadian ratings on the back. South Park ussualy owns 14 or 18 year old ratings. This one says 18, but don't let the rating fool you. It is really not that bad. Most 18 rated ones are real bad. The worst one you can find right now is, ""Insults to Injuries"".",1063324800,6,496,4.071428571428571
7965377,3,B0000696I4,"This DVD is yet another part of the *OLD* collection.  If you've been collecting them all along, buy it.
BUT... You may also be interested in the plans to release ""Deluxe"" boxed sets for each season.  For what it's worth, they had things pretty much under control when they started.  They released the first 6 DVDs with numbers from 1-6... pretty simple, so why did they drop the idea of building a numbered set?
I bought it, as I've bought every other SP DVD to date.  It still drives me nuts that they're going to start all over again.  This means most of the fans who bought the individual DVDs will end up buying it a second time.",1034121600,21,634,4.338983050847458
