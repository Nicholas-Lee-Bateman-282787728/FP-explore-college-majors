5970328,5,B00F8M1DAQ,"When our local network stopped showing the Mother Goose Club my 2 year old granddaughter had the meltdown of all meltdowns. She is receiving Early Intervention for some sensory processing issues and this disruption to her routine was devastating for all of us. :) Thank goodness for Amazon - I was able to order these CD's and they were delivered in a few short days. As to the CD's themselves - I like them. I find them much more palatable than some of the other children's video's out there. They feature all those nursery rhymes that I grew up with so it's easy for me to sing along and to incorporate songs into our daily routine - Itsy Bitsy Spider is currently making changing her diaper much more manageable. :) Video quality is excellent, colors are bright, characters are energetic and happy and songs are simple Also, some songs are .easy to dance to and jump around. I ordered the 3 CD set so we can switch them up and I don't have to listen to the same songs every day I watch her.. Am glad I purchased them so we are not dependent on TV and I can keep them for future grandchildren. Very satisfied with this purchase.",1496793600,3,1130,4.411483253588517

He is two and will watch this for about 20 minutes, which is at least 10 minutes longer than he watches most things. He likes to try to mimic the movements and some of the songs. We use this for getting ready in the morning when he stays overnight.
I have an education background and feel this series is pretty good from that standpoint. The rhythm varies from quick 10 second bits to longer songs. Many of the songs are familiar, so you can start singing along right away. There are always simple movements/dances that go along witht the songs that encourage gross motor movement.",1473638400,,663,4.579831932773109
