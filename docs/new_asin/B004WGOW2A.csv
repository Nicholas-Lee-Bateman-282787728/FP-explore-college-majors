8445082,4,B004WGOW2A,"I was 14 years old in 1959 when I stepped off Santa Fe's EL CAPITAN at the magnificent LAUPT to begin my new life in LA. I was greeted by my father then walked through a beautiful patio bursting with colorful flowers and tropical plants to the Fred Harvey coffee shop where my stepmother was having her Sunday morning coffee. I had eaten fluffy Fred Harvey pancakes in the Hi-Level dining car.

I enjoyed this fantasy trip on the Super Chief I never got a chance to ride.

I am waiting for a cheaper copy of the Super Chief DVD produced by Sunday River.",1403568000,,553,4.3076923076923075
