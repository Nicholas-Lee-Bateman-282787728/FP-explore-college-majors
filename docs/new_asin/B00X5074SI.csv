8715016,4,B00X5074SI,"I was the Director of Photography on this film, so I'm sure I'm biased, but to this day I'm still amazed by how much we accomplished with so little. Shot on nights and weekends for over a year with an all volunteer cast and crew, we really took indie filmmaking to a new level. Hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it.",1473120000,,337,4.121212121212121
8715017,2,B00X5074SI,"This is a cheap indie about ICE stopping human slave trafficking in an unnamed US city that looks like Cleveland. Michael Madsen plays Carlos, a Venezuelan banker who can also handle himself. He acts as a double agent while being a good guy. Mike Johnson (Ray O'Neill) is an ICE agent wanting to infiltrate the ""Syndicate"" that is kidnapping young girls from Cleveland. Ray Keiffer (ray Goodwin) is a city official who won't sign off on a building code variance, putting his daughter at risk.

The sets were cheap looking. The actors were unconvincing. Even Madsen seemed out of it. Dialogue wasn't exciting. The film had mostly poorly written drama interrupted by lame action scenes, some reminding me more of ""Police Squad"" than a serious production.

There are other bad low budget films available.
