1170953,5,8371754876,"Admittedly this show is not for everyone, but it's influence on British sitcom history is not to be denied. The show centers on a group of four students: the mindlessly aggressive punk, Vyvyan; conman and cool guy, Mike; the narcissistic anarchist Rick; and the chronically depressed hippy, Neil. The fifth Young One is comedian Alexei Sayle, who plays the landlord and various other brilliant roles throughout the series.  Fans of AbFab and the Vicar of Dibley will recognize Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French who worked on and helped write the show. Together, the Young Ones encounter the most unlikely of scenarios such as having their landlord turn into a an ax-wielding homicidal maniac, having a vampire delivered to their house, and  being sacked by 18th century peasants. And to make the show even that much cooler, every episode features a guest performance by a different rock band: Motorhead, the Damned, Madness, etc. Love it or hate it, the Young Ones changed the face of British sitcom television forever.",1480896000,2,1019,5.059523809523809

1170997,5,8371754876,"What can you say about The Young Ones that hasn't already been said before?? Rude, obnoxious, & irreverent humor at its absolute finest. If you require the TV shows you watch to convey a ""message"", this isn't the show for you. If you're looking for a stupid, non-cerebral, ""laugh your @$$"" experience- then this is the show for you. The musical guests are always good for a walk down memory lane, as well",1403568000,,404,4.5479452054794525

I finally purchased the DVD set for my brother for Xmas  and recently purchased for myself at Amazon. I have watched all episodes at least 20 times each. Like some of my favorite movies I quote lines from The Young Ones often. It was very cool to see one of my favorite bands ""Motorhead"" as a  musical guest (Season 2 - Ep 1..Bambi..favorite episode).

1171010,4,8371754876,"With episodes like `demolition', `boring' and `flood', series one introduces us to Rick, Mike, Neil and Vyv. I watch this series the first time when I was a kid, in the '80s. My brothers and cousins were big fans and fair to say I struggled to follow (as a 5-year-old). Even now some of the political wit is above my simple humour, but like the Simpsons, this is a show that has something for everyone. `Rick with a silent p' is a phrase that is now common-place in our family!",1300060800,2,477,4.311111111111111
