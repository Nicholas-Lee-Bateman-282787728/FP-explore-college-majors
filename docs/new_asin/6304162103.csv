The evil hunchback crimelord cripples two of his toadies, hacking off ones' arms and pouring acid on the others legs, who team up and seek crippled Kung Fu revenge. Better than average photography and sound (even the back-hump has it's own Kung Fu sound effects!) and of course the trip of seeing freaky flipper-arm karate chops.

7863911,4,6304162103,"This movie was great. Nothing like seeing cripples beat evil forces to a pulp, very gifted cripples (is that an oxymoron?). Only complaint would be the jumping in the fighting, it's as if they cut and then restarted the fight scene in the middle of a sngle shot, i don't get it? Other than that it was great, i suggest this film for all kung-fu movie fans.",1040428800,,356,4.3283582089552235
7863912,1,6304162103,"This movie is a ridiculous effort to cash in on sideshow curiosities. Obviously, the makers of this movie hoped the appeal of crippled kung-fu masters would overshadow the horrible, awful story, characters, and cinematography. And, for this movie's considerable cult following, it probably succeeds. For all others, I should hope not.
The story is about two ordinary guys who become crippled at the hands of some local evil, humpbacked warlord type. The first of the title characters, for whatever reason, fell out of favor with the warlord guy and got his arms cut off as punishment. Now crippled but still alive, our first hero bumbles throughout the streets of nearby villages looking not for medical attention, but for food. The locals do not seem to be perturbed by his bloody stumps (one of which has a fingerlike protrusion that makes it obvious that the actor was not maimed, but born crippled). The villagers, however, do seem to enjoy jeering at his misfortune and giving him food and drink, knowing that he can't properly eat or drink it without arms.
Anyway, he eventually finds his way to some old guy who trains him in the kung-fu ways. Meanwhile, our other hero and former henchman of the evil warlord also falls out of favor and gets acid dumped on his legs, which subsequently shrivel up. He also eventually makes his way to this old guy who trains him. Turns out this old guy has a beef with the warlord about some ill-explained artifacts that teach some unbeatable, ill-explained secret kung-fu techniques.
Various fights and other antics take place, until the final showdown with the evil warlord, who knows kung-fu and whose secret move is crushing his opponents with his apparently metallic (as the sound effects would suggest) hump-back. But, our heroes unite to destroy him and thus the movie abruptly ends.
The story and characters are bad enough, but the fighting is worse, for two reasons. First, the sound effects are worse than a circa-1980s arcade fighting game. Any successful attack, be it a punch, kick, or strangling, makes a cheap, Indian Jones-esque sound, while missed attacks of any sort make some strange ""thump"" sound. Second, the fights are sped up to make them more impressive, but not in any conventional way. The film makers do not simply choreograph a faster fight, which would be fairly easy, nor do they simply speed up the film, which would be easy and cheap. Oh no. Instead, they take out individual frames from the fight sequences so that the fighters' actions appear to be much faster (and shockingly choppy).
If all this still sounds appealing, I encourage you to buy or rent this movie (if you can find it). Otherwise, go the safer route and rent almost any other movie...except Tomb Raider.",1031529600,,2744,4.877944325481799

7863914,5,6304162103,"If the idea of real crippled guys performing kung fu on bad guys is your idea of excellence in film, you must possess this movie.  Definitely not the stereorypical hero film, nor is it for the exceedingly weak-hearted.  As in, if your heart is too weak to watch the nightly news, then avoid this.  Otherwise, it is your moral duty to own this movie.",1023840000,3,349,4.421875
7863915,5,6304162103,"This has to be the most bizarre kung fu movie in existence, definately entertaining, probably due to the bizarreness of it.  this is a must see!  Armless and legless kung fu fighting at its best!",990230400,,195,4.542857142857143
7863916,5,6304162103,"I just recently purchased this video and who would have thought that a movie with cripples could be done so well, great film a must see. The movie is about two men who are both crippled by the order of an evil boss guy who runs sort of a moblike organization. One has his legs smashed, and the other's arms are chopped off. The two men eventually come across a funny looking kung fu master who trains them - so they can get their revenge.",973728000,,438,4.1647058823529415
7863917,5,6304162103,There is no sex but its got ninjas with real life disabilities that can  kick some evil A$$ in the wazoo.  I give this my highest rating and would  say its the best movie of all time and hope that it is produced soon to  honor the art of ninja.,957916800,,244,3.82
7863918,5,6304162103,A wonderful action packed film that focuses on an individuals abilities rather than their disabilities. I thought the directing and the location was great. The casting was good as well as exceptional acting. The fighting  scenes were awesome. Two thumbs up.,925171200,2,257,5.2682926829268295
