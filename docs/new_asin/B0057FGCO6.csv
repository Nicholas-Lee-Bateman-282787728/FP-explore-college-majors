8460550,4,B0057FGCO6,This dvd is good it could have been better if they would have added some other luchadors to the card but watching the blue demon is still pretty good and watching Gronda was something I thought I would never see again since he did receive a really bad injury. Other than that the dvd is good.,1396828800,,292,4.232142857142857
8460551,3,B0057FGCO6,"This was the first in the Viva La Lucha series and is a good disc. None of the matches are five-star classics, but for die-hard wrestling fans its worth checking out. Be warn that a couple of bouts are clipped which is my only real gripe.",1316736000,,238,4.195652173913044
