8460207,3,B00571SL1C,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""DOCTOR IN TROUBLE"" (1970) (91 min/Color) -- Starring: Leslie Phillips, Harry Secombe, Robert Morley, Angela Scoular, Irene Handl, Simon Dee, James Robertson Justice, Joan Sims, Freddie Jones, John Le Mesurier

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

British Invasion arrives again at the doorstep of VCI, and restored from their vaults.

This, the seventh and final film in the series, sees Leslie Phillips romping around a luxury liner, in what comes across as a less funny cross between 'Doctor At Sea' and 'Carry On Cruising'  By now a long way from the innocence of 'Doctor In The House',

Dr. Tony Burke (Leslie Phillips) is in love with Ophelia O'Brien (Angela Scoular) but doesn't have time to propose to her as she leaves for a cruise to the Mediterranean. Also on board the cruise ship is an old school chum of Burke's who plays 'Dr. Dare' in a very popular TV series and who women flock to. Burke decides to join the cruise, but is first apprehended as a stowaway, and then becomes the captain's steward. For Burke, trying to talk to Ophelia is a hard enough task, but he meets some funny characters on board, such as a pools winner and a very stubborn captain.

Overall this is a very basic film that has nothing special.  Fans of the original Doctor films will feel that this has drifted far from port, can be enjoyed if in the mood, it's far funnier than the previous film in the series, the lukewarm 'Doctor In Clover'.

Special footnotes: -- Robert Morley, who played the role of Lancelot Spratt's brother George, was the original choice for the role of Lancelot himself in the original Doctor in the House.

Special footnotes: -- Angela Scoular was married to actor Leslie Phillips (1982 - 11 April 2011) (her death)
