8191263,5,B000PGR7DC,My doctor is one of the presenters and is an expert on Celiac disease.  This is a good comprehensive overview suitable for support groups or the newly diagnosed.,1354492800,,161,4.75
8191264,5,B000PGR7DC,"I had never heard of Celiac Disease when my blood test came back positive. Between receiving the blood test results and having a biopsy to confirm the disease, I purchased and watched these DVDS. They are clear and thorough and were just what I needed to help understand the disease, the diagnosis process (blood test, biopsy, etc.), long term effects, and what the diagnosis means. They are not fancy (i.e. no special effects, dramatizations, etc.) but a great resource that I highly recommend to anyone who would like to learn more about Celiac Disease.",1245542400,2,555,4.914893617021277
