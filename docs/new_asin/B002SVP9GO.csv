3982436,3,B002SVP9GO,"It`s been years since I read the Great Novel, but it seems to me that this product only uses the frame of the story; great lines and monologues from the Master Wilde is worked over, deleted or simplified....

Ben Barnes may be physically right, but his personality is all wrong....

...in the beginning that is... when the plot go ways from Oscar Wilde`s storyline it suddenly grows effectivly as does Mr Barnes. Mr Firth as old Harry is a-look-alike George Sander`s Harry almost 70 years earlier....

The new inspirations are the best(like Harry`s daughter), but it remaains unsuccessful as a whole....

Stick to the 1944 MGM version and - I know a lot of people hate it, but I don`t; - and the haunting 2006 up-date with David Gallaghar....",1282089600,3,742,4.728682170542636

3982438,3,B002SVP9GO,This latest version of Oscar Wilde's classic novel is nice to look at but rather dull.  The characters bisexuality is more explicit than usual but the film never reaches the outrageous kinkiness of the 1970's euro trash edition.,1280620800,4,228,5.0
3982439,5,B002SVP9GO,"DORIAN GRAY as adapted form Oscar Wilde's famous novel 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and directed by Oliver Parker is about as fine a transfer of a period novel to the screen as has been made of late.  The settings, costumes, and acting are all outstanding and with Parker's 'enhancing' some of the debauchery in the transformed life of this famous character updated to allow for more sensuality and brutality than prior cinematic versions, the tale really becomes dramatic.

Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), an orphaned, abused child who happens to inherit a mansion in London upon the death of his only relative, comes to London as a young inordinately handsome yet shy man.  He is immediately seizes the attention of Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) who believes that the only goal in life is to respond to your desires, to your sensual needs.  Dorian is introduced to a young painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) who is attracted to Dorian's beauty and as he paints his portrait he becomes enamored with his model. As the portrait is completed Lord Henry suggests that Dorian could always remain as beautiful as his portrait if he 'sold his soul' to remain ever youthful. Dorian takes up the idea and follows Lord Henry's tutelage to drink, smoke, and carouse in brothels, opium dens, and in the boudoirs of all the middle aged ladies of society. He encounters a beautiful young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), falls in love only to cast her aside (we later discover that her body has been thrown into the river much to the chagrin of her brother James (Johnny Harris).  As Dorian's thirst for lusty and scandalous behaviors increases he causes much harm: the mutual attraction between Dorian and Basil eventually results in Dorian butchering Basil and discarding his body into the river grave.  Dorian decides to leave London and  travel to exotic places to try to fill his lascivious appetite: he returns twenty odd years later and every one has aged except Dorian.  Lord Henry's daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), born when Dorian departed London, is Dorian's intellectual match and the two are mutually attracted but Lord Henry violently objects, knowing what the real Dorian Gray is inside.  Dorian's secret - that he remains young eternally while his portrait ages and reveals the vile aspects of his corrupt life - is finally revealed and the ending is a gruesome one.

Ben Barnes, Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, and Rebecca Hall are all superb in their roles - as are all of the many well-known fine British actors who fill minor roles.  The DVD adds comments from many of these actors in a way that focuses on Oscar Wilde's novel, making the commitment of everyone involved seem more acutely aware of the film's purpose.  It is a very well photographed, costumes, and lighted piece of cinematography - a truly excellent period piece for this great novel to come alive again.

3982440,5,B002SVP9GO,"I finally was able to see the 2009 version of Dorian Gray, adapted from the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.

I am writing this review AS an Oscar Wilde fan. I have read The Picture of Dorian Gray twice and I have read The Canterville Ghost twice.

I am going to tell you right now that these negative reviews that claim that this film is an insult to Oscar Wilde are WRONG! It's as if people who know very little about the works of Oscar Wilde are following a trend.

Those that say this would make Oscar Wilde roll over in his grave clearly have never seen the dreadful mid 2000s version of The Picture of Dorian Gray that re-sets it in the 1960s with a female Basil with horrendous acting. And they clearly have never seen the 1940s version of The Canterville Ghost that turned the entire story into World War 2 propaganda about a solider having to prove himself against a Nazi.

I will admit that this not a word for word faithful adaptation of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray however it is very true to the heart of the novel, the meaning and purpose. The character portrayals are perfect and accurate. All changes are purely superficial. I know Ben Barnes as Dorian does not resemble the character of the novel however he does resemble Oscar Wilde himself and since Oscar Wilde saw himself in Dorian I felt this was a brilliant use of visual symbolism in Wilde's own relationship with Dorian Gray.

I know that some people have complained about the adding of the character Emily Wotton, whom does not exist in the novel. What people fail to remember is that nearly all film versions of The Picture of Dorian Gray have this 'redeemer' character. In the 1940s movie her name was Gladys. In the 1973 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray her name was Beatrice. In most versions she's Basil's niece or daughter but in this version she was Lord Henry's daughter.

What many don't know is that this character does exist in the novel. She's mentioned briefly near the end as a country girl named Hetty. Her part in the novel isn't as big as in the film adaptations but she does still exist and she works to add sympathy to Dorian's character.

You cannot see the inner workings of Dorian's mind in a physical medium like films or plays as you do with the novel so you you need a new way to see his moral struggle. And this is done through the presence of Emily.

Collin Firth was incredible as Lord Henry. That was the best portrayal of Lord Henry since George Sanders.  When he says 'People die by common sense.' he fully became Lord Henry for me.  Most people treat the role too academically and sound like they're boredly reading from a book.  Collin Firth however really got it.  He really understood the character.  This version of The Picture of Dorian Gray has more of Oscar Wilde's witty epigrams than any other version before it. The only line missing that I wish was in here is Lord Henry gives Dorian a cigarette case. In this one it's just inscribed with Dorian's name. In the novel it reads 'The World has changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips re-write history.'

The only character of the film I did not like was this version of Sibyl Vane. In this version Dorian seduces her into sleeping with him before marriage (as he does in the original film with Angela Lansbury in the role).

When Sibyl starts talking about having a family Dorian argues that it is too soon, much thanks to the ideas planted in his head by Lord Henry. When this Sibyl kills herself it gets revealed that she was with child. This takes away from her sympathy. It's true having a child out of wed lock was frowned upon in the Victorian era but it did happen. And it did not mean the end of the world. Look at the character of Fantine in Les Miserables. It was selfish of this Sibyl to kill herself because she did not just kill herself, she killed herself and the unborn baby that she seemed so eager to have only a few scenes earlier.  It looked almost as if the suicide was out of spite.

Sibyl does kill herself in the earlier incarnations but at least she had never done it while carrying a baby and knowing she was carrying the baby, and having wanted to raise the child. It's hard to sympathize with this version of Sibyl, especially since you know her brother Jim would have taken care of both her and the baby if not Dorian.

Basil, however, was very sympathetic. One thing I'm glad they cut was that in most versions Basil didn't just disapprove of Dorian's relationship with Sibyl out of jealousy, he also had told him not to marry beneath his class. Basil doesn't do that in this version. Basil is the most sympathetic of Dorian's Victims in this film.

Dorian himself is played exceptionally well though my favourite character portrayal in this version is Lord Henry. Dorian goes from ruthless and cruel to sympathetic and tragic in a heartbeat. The struggle is perfect. You can see his conscience, and not just with the painting. He is fighting against his own darker instincts which adds to making him sympathetic.

As a true Oscar Wilde fan I feel they captured the spirit of Oscar Wilde's intent. This was the best version of The Picture of Dorian Gray I have ever seen, the black and white version coming in close second for having the better and more innocent version of Sibyl Vane.

I am in America and we never got a theatrical release of this version of Dorian Gray.  This film is truly good, truly exceptional, and, if you want to watch any film about a young looking immortal, this is far more intelligent, interesting and just plain better than the Twilight Saga.",1278633600,69,5627,4.474609375
3982441,5,B002SVP9GO,Great movie.... don't want to by a new piece of equipment to view it....  Can we expect the Region 1 version any time soon?,1273536000,2,123,4.125
3982442,5,B002SVP9GO,"I wasn't expecting to like this very much.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that everyone involved with this film knocked himself out.  Oliver Parker, the director, certainly had so much more style and flair in his version than I'd seen in the old black and white version. Ben Barnes as Dorian couldn't be better.  He is superb.  He has the perfect face too for the walking around Dorian whose vices don't show on his face. Firth is his mentor but he is an armchair decadent compared to Dorian, able to talk the talk but not walk the walk.

If there is anyone on the planet who doesn't know the gist of this Oscar Wilde classic novel, it is this: Dorian Gray is a handsome, wealthy young man whose picture is painted as he is launched into society. He is quickly diverted into an ever escalating cycle of vice and debauchery.  However, instead of the ravages of dissolution marring his face and figure, they instead ravage the painting.  How far will he take this and is there any way out as the painting gets worse and worse?

The settings, the costumes, the details--all wonderful. I think Wilde himself would have enjoyed being at the premiere of this film!

3982443,4,B002SVP9GO,"With the dank and drab backcloth of London almost as gray as the title character, I had seen the trailers for this 2009 remake and was excited, yet skeptical that it would not hold up to the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray/dp/B000OHBCI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>
I didn't doubt that Ben Barnes would make a great Dorian but knew that (at least for me) no one would be close to the excellent George Sanders as Sir Henry ""Harry"" Wooton, the hedonistic and outspoken mentor who inevitably leads to Dorian's downfall.
However, I was very pleased with the modern retake, made more graphic for a modern audience of course, but still suspenseful and dark. Colin Firth did not disappoint me as Sir Harry also, not a patch on Sanders of course, but an admirable and believable job.
For those unfamiliar with Oscar Wilde's ONLY novel, it's a simple but great almost Faustian tale.
A young man of great beauty and charm wishes that a recently commissioned painting by his friend Basil Hallward, should age instead of himself, leaving him forever young and able to relish everything pleasurable in life.
In the original the wish is made in front of a statue of an Egyptian God cat, and Dorian is warned about making flippant wishes in it's company.
In this version (much like the book) Gray pledges to sell his soul or ""nail it to the Devils alter"" and soon thereafter the painting begins to exhibit signs of aging, where he does not.
This version is a little closer to the book, the initial love interest Sybil is an actress in a small theater performing Shakepeare, not a singer in an East end tavern (as Angela Lansbury portrayed in the original) and other aspects here are lifted almost word for word, from the book.
It's quite graphic of course (being 2009) - whereas the original black & white hinted at Mr Grays immoral behavior, this version gives it to you full in the face, but not in a gratuitous way, it adds weight to the character, as we watch his slow descent from innocence and purity to, debauchery and murder.
I won't give the movie away, for those who don't know it, but it's a great story.
To some the movie may be a little slow, but I loved the slow burn feel to the script and screenplay, little hints of the malice and cruelty that have warped Dorians soul in the painting are hinted, or creepily glimpsed, without giving away the climax of the movie.

I am however curious as to why this has not had a US release? There is only in fact a TBA on a release date if you research it. That's a shame, considering the amount of movies released here, a film of this quality with an exceptional cast should not have been overlooked.

Overall I gave 4 stars, for a great remake. Even if a remake wasn't needed.",1265673600,8,2824,4.74949083503055
3982444,5,B002SVP9GO,"Dorian Gray is an adaptation of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"".  The movie is faithfully to the book 'til the end.  I mean in the sense of interpretation.  I love Ben Barnes, he was the perfect choice for Dorian Gray and his acting was excellent.

At first I thought of him some kind of handsome face eventhough he did a great job in Narnia but I really doubt about how he going to perform for the role of this complexity.  I know that I was unfaired to him since I have been compared Ben with Stewart Townsend in the same role.  Stewart Townsend was Dorian Gray in the movie called ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with an air of sinister and sarcastic arrogrant immortal.  And Ben was a sweet face who appeared for the roles of curious, naive young man in ""Stardust"", and brave young prince in ""Narnia"" thats make me wonder what he will become Dorian Gray

But he did! with surprising perfect for the role of a man who was misguided by some cruel, coward and envy man like Harry Wotton (Colin Firth).  It was the interpretation that make the movie so complex and interesting. And at the end of the movie was the redemption and love.

For my point of view, Dorian Gray is a drama movie which if we stop and think for a moment, the meaning of ""Live your life to your heart's desire"" is true.  But if it fall into the wrong hand or evil guidance then the victim is exactly like the dark soul of Dorian Gray.  However, love conquer everything. Even the evil man like Dorian Gray also have a heart and he begged for help.  He want to start fresh and he struggle for it.  Finally, he accept his faith (this is the different end from the book) as he fight and kill his evil soul with his own hand.  May he (Dorian Gray) rest in peace.

It's based off the novel the Portrait of Dorian Gray where the darker and more evil the character becomes, instead of it showing on his own body/face, the evil inside him shows upon a portrait Mr. Gray keeps hidden away in his attic.

3982480,3,B002SVP9GO,"The producers of this film have shown respect for the classic moral tale Oscar Wilde told in ""The Picture of Dorian Gay"" by omitting the words which give significance to the book's ""compelling theme of goodness and beauty as rival ideals of life"" Apart from a few beautifully acted and filmed scenes (chief among them the touching, heart-breaking love story of Sibyl Vane and Dorian). the film seems intended on satisfying the jaded sensibilities of modern movie-goers, with gratuitously violent depictions of physical and moral corruptions (""powerful and sizzling""- the grossest of these the actual dismembering of Dorian's best friend). All of this is handled with more delicacy by having Wilde or Dorian indirectly referring to them in speech. The moving argument Sibyl and Dorian have after her failure to act causing Dorian to lose all love and respect for her finds no place in the film indicating that the writers have no interest in the real issues which determined Wilde's mode of life life and the writing of his book. ""Two ideals were at war in Oscar Wilde; He loves Sibyl because of her ""magnificent beauty""; Sibyl loves Dorian because of the  ""goodness of His love"", If we can judge by the way Wilde ends his story (a violent stab in the heart of ""The Picture"") we may come to believe that  he finally found himself agreeing with Sybil: Beauty must defer to the primacy of ""The Good"".

Unfortunately Colin Firth cannot save this later re-telling of the Oscar Wilde masterpiece.
It succumbs to painfully obvious, cliche ridden scripting and completely lacks the deft subtleties of the 1945 production.
This is not a movie for people who think; I imagine this would only appeal to viewers who enjoy being spoon fed cinematic fare that is only marginally palatable.

3982531,5,B002SVP9GO,"I loved this dark, beautiful, brooding movie. The actors, costumer, sets, music and cinematography were woven together into an exquisite and haunting retelling of Oscar Wilde's famous (and rather scandalous!) novel, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Colin Firth was wonderfully clever (and wicked) as Lord Henry Wotton. Ben Barnes really shone as Dorian Gray, at times both angelic and demonic. His male beauty was perfect for the part, but it's his acting skills that really transport you into this story. You could see the corruption take hold of his insides and begin to overrule the better parts of Dorian's character as his handsome face remains unchanged. This is an incredible retelling of the classic story, and the best version I've ever seen. Definitely a keeper!",1465948800,3,769,5.16

Too much emphasis on the visual to make a point that we can grasp with no major difficulties. Not particularly thrilled with how the storyline played out. However, even in the midst of these hindrances (and any others that a well-trained eye wouldn't miss), there was one scene in which Colin Firth's talent shows through, precisely, because of the subtlety... look for it... he's humming a waltz.

3982581,4,B002SVP9GO,"This movie has a great look and the main character, Dorian, (played by Ben Barnes), gives a finely nuanced performance.  Colin Firth is the tempter that turns the pliable Dorian toward an ever-darkening path.  A good adaptation that, as another reviewer noted, captures the essence of Wilde's book.  Yes, there are changes, but a total re-hash of previous movie versions would make for a dull viewing.  In this movie, Dorian seems soulless - not that he loses his soul - he just never seems to have found it until it is too late.  And Firth's character also seems clueless as to his part in Dorian's evolution; that struck a false note with me considering the changes to the end of the movie.

The movie is paced and has some dreamy-nightmarish moments.  I would watch it again.",1441670400,,778,4.676470588235294

The movie is certainly very fascinating, not at all boring. I wish I could have come away feeling that I had learned a moral lesson from the story. I wish it had ended with some slight hint that there was hope of salvation for Dorian as well as for ""Harry,"" his ""mentor."" Dorian, near the end, seems to repent and want to become good.

As it stands, it is still a good story about a beautiful and naive heir to wealth who comes to London and decides to live up to his ""hero's"" values and live a life of debauchery. A painter captures his likeness and attributes the acclaim of this work to Dorian's beauty. Dorian decides to sell his soul to maintain his youth and beauty and so the hedonism begins.

There are many twists to this version that are not in the book. They are well done and entertaining. Colin Firth is the star of the show. No surprise about that. I think most will find it dark, but enjoyable.",1419033600,,657,4.298387096774194

Dorian is a young man who sells his soul to somebody (you assume it is the devil, pretty standard although not said) to stay young forever like his portrait.  He finds that now his portrait ages instead of him and with each sin or wickedness he does it gets uglier and he stays young and handsome.

The sad part this is more prevalent throughout history and in these current times.  The only saving grace for the movie was Dorian being able to admit his choices were selfish, destroying of others and totally wrong.  The ending was a sad one even though there had been a spark of hope.

I thought this was a very good movie! Not one I would own and rewatch over and over but a good one to see. Rarely in paranormal do we focus on the life and the later consequences of the ""bad guy"".

Plus: throughout the movie, shadow and light are used well to convey the seediness of what is happening. Especially toward the end, with Emily and Dorian, when the scenes were so much brighter, it really felt like a better time.

My only complaint would be the jumpy scenes. It was fine overall, but it took me nearly half the movie to adjust. I wonder if there were as many deleted scenes/ outtakes, as the jerkiness would suggest?",1399507200,,731,4.360294117647059

I absolutely loved Ben Barnes in this one as Dorian. He portrayed the youthful, callow Dorian believably, and was a delight to look at. Very handsome and sensitive.  Colin Firth's character was played masterfully and the gradual change in Dorian from an innocent , impressionable youth to a decadent young man was extreme in this version. The sets, costumes,and music were captivating. The movie would have been perfection if only the extreme violence and over-the-top orgy scenes had been toned down.  Absolutely not for children or immature audiences!!",1399507200,,695,5.196428571428571

In short, this film is freely inspired by the novel and is in no way based on it, since it disregards everything that makes the book a worldwide classic. Sure, when any piece of literature becomes a movie, things change in the adaptation. The problem is that the film changed the plot so much, that the whole concept behind the book is not there...

3982717,5,B002SVP9GO,The Picture of Dorian Gray was a excellent book & this movie relates to the viewer in lurid detail how seductive a life style of self pleasure & debauchery without moral restraints can be for the young! It also shows even with a free pass to never feel the destructive elements of such a lifestyle how unfulfilling & shallow it becomes without having the most valued of feeling's in your life. I will not express what that is you can watch the movie to find out! This is a cerebral story and essay on life! So it doe's require thought to truly appreciate so if your looking for explosions & and a load of fancy C.G.I. effects to entertain you while you stare slack jawed at the screen this may not be the movie for you! On the other hand if you have read the book & understood what Oscar Wilde was trying to get across you will love this version of the story it is the best I've ever seen!,1368057600,,889,4.204678362573099

3982724,2,B002SVP9GO,"What if you have made an Oscar Wilde film adaptation, but failed to give the movie the author's wit and style? The answer is ""Dorian Gray,"" Oliver Parker's lamentable 2009 adaptation that would either shock or amuse the great writer, though not in the way the filmmakers intended.

The story of Dorian Gray is so famous that it does not need to be repeated in detail here. Ben Barnes plays a young and handsome late 19th century Englishman Dorian Gray, who having made a Faustian deal does not get old. Being enthralled by cynical Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), Dorian commits sins and crimes, but every time he does, his image on the canvas changes, reflecting the corruption of his soul.

Some people might say we should enjoy the film adaptation for what it is. In principle the argument makes a valid point, but not here, because ""Dorian Gray"" as a drama is plain boring and predictable. The story is rushed, especially the part where Dorian falls in love with an actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Dorian's ""hedonist lifestyle"" means cheesy love making scenes. The picture of Dorian Gray, the key element of the whole story, looks even cheesier, more like a zombie from a low-budget horror movie.

Despite the decent production and costume designs, ""Dorian Gray"" greatly suffers from bland acting and uninspired direction. Director Oliver Parker has already made two films based on Oscar Wilde's works, ""An Ideal Husband"" (1999) and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2002), but as you know, they were originally written as a play. ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fin-de-sicle novel that enjoys flaunting conventions. Sadly the new filmed version is only following them.",1362268800,,1683,4.960992907801418
3982725,4,B002SVP9GO,"Good acting, sets, photography. The film was quite decent and a good watch. I really liked the way the character evolved as he began to feel invincible. It reminded me of Wells' The Invisible Man with something to say about human nature and the corrupting power of privilege and unaccountability. This can't be done too often!!

In that sense this was a horror film and for my tastes a good one.

On the negative side, I felt that the very ending was not necessary and even distracted. But this was not a big deal. I also felt that some critical material was left out in editing, like the basis for the ""magic"" of the painting. But this too was not a big deal. The film was still good.

The extra features were a mixed bag. The ""making of"" was sort of interesting, with regard to what the actors thought about Wilde and the film. But not deep. The other added features were run of the mill.

I should say that I have not read Wilde's story or seen any other film of this story. So I can't make comments that some potential viewers might be interested in.",1359849600,,1054,4.33502538071066

3982729,5,B002SVP9GO,"Such a master piece of English literature is very tempting if not mesmerizing for film makers. The problem is that it is so well known and so famous that it is very difficult to do something fresh, something new and authentic, something fascinating.  Apparently Oliver Parker succeeds in doing that.

His first solution is to reduce the dialogue to a minimal presence and especially to reduce it to catch phrases, short proverbial sentences, small philosophical sayings that are really trying to catch flies by preaching full enjoyment of all pleasures but only for the flies it catches and not for the utterer of such lame falsely ethical mottos, like ""Conscience is a polite term for cowardice."" ""Some things are more precious because they don't last."" ""I want to begin again, stay away from everything, everything but you,"" he declares to Emily Wharton minutes before he rapes her, takes her, before she gives herself to him in a fully mesmerized state.

When this is done you can then play with some sound special effects to create a disquieting and even disturbing atmosphere. The house creaks, cracks and moans constantly. The attic is haunted with a fugacious vision of the father beating up his young son who is finding refuge there or maybe is kept prisoner there, and a piece of dialogue suggests the mother died early and the father is reverting his sorrow onto his son he keeps responsible for the death. And I will say nothing of the moaning people in the bleak night of ;London, of the crying and howling in the various opium dens and other brothels and cut-throat dungeons.

Visual effects come next, not so much the very special ones we find in all science fiction films, or horror films. Essentially lights and shadows, and fast camera movements and very dynamic editing. We then start doubting what we have just seen for but an instant or what we have hardly espied hardly a second. The visual work of the film is subliminal and works onto our unconscious to create an atmosphere of fear, fright, danger, horror, cruelty, and so many nice feelings.

Then it is easy to work onto our psyche to make us horrified, terrified and grossed out by that monstrous man and at the same time to build up the end so well that we are on the side of the monster who is trapped in an attic from which he cannot escape because the world does not want to believe he has changed, and we actually should doubt his having changed really since he is somewhere between 40 and 50 and he pretends to be in love with a young girl around at the very most 18. And can we believe he has changed when we see him raping her, taking her or simply receiving in some violent contact the love she is giving him in a mesmerized state that prevents her from thinking? Can we?

That's why the film is good. It even tries to give some innocence to the most perverted being we can imagine, even in Victorian or Edwardian society. Just one foot off Jack the Ripper and not an inch away from Blue Beard.

Colin Firth does a wonderful job portraying the corrupting influence of Lord Wotton.  The setting and key characters of the movie follows the original novel, but some of the key events have been changed.  A prime example is the end of the story, which ends in flames in the movie.

In the book it was done by science and pretty interestingly so....in the movie it was so typical it kinda pissed me off.

3982742,3,B002SVP9GO,"At first, I saw this as a butchering of Oscar Wilde's original masterpiece, but the main difference is the sex.

There is so much of it in this film. The film Dorian will have sex with anything that walks and talks, and things get weird very fast. There was nothing in the book that ever mentioned bondage, unusual fetish, or orgies. There is also the fact that it is implied that Dorian sleeps with Basil, which is highly controversial and can be debated in several different ways. In the novel, it can be ascertained that Basil has homosexual feelings for Dorian. These, however, come out in an expression of love rather than lust. In the film, they do the deed and that's that. This was my primary issue with the film.

My other issues with the film are based primarily on personal expectations that were not met. While I think they did an excellent job casting Basil and Lord Henry, I never pictured Dorian as a brunette with brown eyes or Sybil to have flaming red hair. That's another thing,

Sybil. She seemed extremely devoid of character. Blank. I didn't understand her character, or her relationship with Dorian in the film. They also left out the scene I find most powerful, the scene where Sybil is weeping at Dorian's feet.

I appreciate the thematic elements and the creative license taken by the directors, but I probably would have liked the film more if I hadn't read the book.",1337299200,3,1394,4.608870967741935
3982743,4,B002SVP9GO,"Ben Barnes was delicious to look at throughout the movie, as Dorian Gray himself was supposed to be, so while he's literally not the incarnation of Dorian with golden hair as described in the novella, he is perfect as a representation of gorgeous, innocent, unbesmirched youth. Barnes was a good actor, too, I thought.

I didn't really grok on the whole added flashback thing with childhood beatings; that's a modern psychological construct that I felt was unnecessary and in fact detracted from the story (none of that was in the novella, was it?). I also felt they went way too over-the-top with the painting, which made it more campy and cheesy than creepy and scary.

I SO appreciated that this movie gave a nod to the homosexual element, as well as making the opium usage and extreme sex more overt. Dorian was engaged in corrupt activities, pushing the envelope during his time, and they didn't sugar coat that in this version. I loved the mother/daughter scene and the sexual encounter with Basil (is that why this movie wasn't released in the U.S.?). The Basic actor captured that character's longing and heartache.

Though there were added elements and changes, overall I felt this movie was quite faithful to the spirit of Oscar Wilde and what he intended. I've read the book a few times and while it's been quite awhile since my last read, this movie would be a good introduction for the modern reader/moviegoer. And of course Colin Firth was Colin Firth, who can't do much wrong.

Ben Barnes does a fantastic job as Dorian, and Colin Firth as Henry Wotton is Dorian's perfect foil. In any role he plays, Firth never ceases to amaze me!  Too bad this film was never released in American theatres (only in the UK).  It's such a gem!

As far as the Blu-ray goes, the sound is crystal-clear and the picture is beautifully done in 1080p high definition format.

3982748,1,B002SVP9GO,"This is the first time when a movie with such an engaging and talented cast fell short. Dorian Gray is my favorite story. I've seen all of the film and play adaptations and this was sad compared to its predecessors.

I realize this was made for Showtime but it seemed rushed and rather cheap for even a made-for-cable film. The movie felt like it was a play, not a movie. This adaptation was useless. There was no point for it to be made other than to give people jobs. I was shocked that Colin Firth was in this mess.

I enjoyed the actors. Ben Barnes (never heard of him before this) fit Dorian perfectly. Ben Chaplin was convincing as Basil and Firth stole the show. But the movie was just bad. It was an embarrassment to such a fascinating tale.

What I love about Dorian Gray is the creepiness of the story and this lacked creepiness. Dorian kills and goes off to sex clubs but you never really feel convinced he's into this stuff. Ben just didn't carry the film well for me. I think he looked the part of Dorian but I think a better actor would've done a better job. He was also too boyish and innocent-looking. Other actors who played Dorian always had a suspenseful look to them even if they were handsome but Ben is just too ""frat boy look"" for me to take seriously in this role.

The movie was incredibly slow and boring considering how short it was. I fell asleep on it through the entire movie. Luckily I got it on DVD so I could rewind back but still. I kept dozing off. Some things moved too slow while others moved too fast and it seemed thrown together with a lack of editing. You had tons of female characters who weren't properly introduced so you started to get them confused. The scenes also switched badly. People would be all over the place and you didn't know how the heck they got there from time to time.

When Dorian went on vacation all those years, none of it was shown in the film. He left one day and came back the next with everyone older. Made no sense. It was like the film skipped out on things because they had a time restraint. Also I think they skipped on some killings Dorian did but not sure. I think he kills someone in the street in the original story but you didn't get that here.

What I hated the most was Dorian going to the sex parlor. It was completely lame and didn't add anything to this particular Dorian film. We are supposed to see how dark his soul is becoming by him going to these clubs but it just wasn't convincing.

The biggest disappointment was the painting. I remember other Dorian Gray films and I would be so frightened for days just at the way the portrait look so I couldn't wait to see how it would look in this film. Complete disappointment. Instead of putting the time and effort into making the picture look authentic all we get is a big special effects show with cheap-looking results. To top it off the portrait made sounds and moved its mouth! Please! This is the case of too much not being enough. The filmmakers turned a classic into a joke. Everything doesn't need special effects!

This is the worst Dorian Gray movie ever made and I hope they don't make another one if they are all gonna be this bad. I see why this was on cable and didn't make it to the big screen.

If you love this timeless story as much as I do, skip this sad copycat and check this out:

3982749,5,B002SVP9GO,"I never read the book and I didn't even know about this movie until a facebook friend of mine told me about this movie that Ben Barnes had made. I checked to see if they would be showing it on fios, and turns out they were going to show it on showtime. Last year in August late at night I saw this movie and fell in love with it. I love how Ben's character Dorian first appears as the innocent man just trying to get familiar to this new environment he's been introduced to. And then once he meets Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), his demeanor changes into something quite unexpected. And it all begins with the wonderful painting by Basil (Ben Chaplin), one night in Dorian's new home the three men converse about the painting, and then while Dorian is looking at the painting very closely Henry begins to tell him that the painting will forever look young while Dorian will age. Then Dorian does the unthinkable in saying perhaps ""I shall nail my soul to the devil's altar"" , in which Henry says ""to remain as you are, fair trade..Dorian would you?"" And Dorian says ""yes""... Afterwards begins his demise, he soon enters a life of debauchery and violence and becomes more darker, sinister and a bit more attracted to opposite/same sex. There is one scene in the movie that caught me by surprise, the kiss between Dorian and Basil and what happens next you will have to watch for yourself... But then later on he tries to redeem himself, to try to save the last bit of hope he has left by dating and falling for Henry's daughter Emily Wotton. But Henry begins to get suspicious when seeing Dorian after so many years and still looking as he did the day they met. He then discovers his secret, and does his best to end it all. I was very sad when it got close to the ending, hearing Dorian say to Emily ""You have my heart, my whole heart"" made me feel so bad for him and hope that he would make it but sadly it ends with him turning into what his picture looked like..

3982750,4,B002SVP9GO,"With his tall slim body, long elegant hair, and pretty smooth face, Ben Barnes makes a great Dorian Gray. He has a youthful, almost feminine beauty that certainly would be needed to play the part of a human that is ageless and extremely handsome yet becoming rotten inside as his soul withers away. Oscar Wilde's novel is the basis of the film but there were some liberties taken in the film which in my opinion may have made the film stronger. Wilde hints at Dorian Gray's bi-sexuality in the novel but the film briefly allows this aspect of Dorian's character to be overt. One strength of the film was the excellent sets, especially the Victorian period interiors and the wonderful costumes of Regency England. There were scenes, just on the screen for a few seconds, which hinted at orgies and sado-masochism, which gave just the right amount of decadence to the film. Seeing Dorian Gray bound in leather straps for 2 seconds lets the viewer know that Dorian was exploring all kinds of sexual adventures in his ever lasting youth. Barnes does a good job of showing the cynical decay of Dorian's soul, the theme of Wilde's novel.

Of course, it is totally expected that Colin Firth will do a great job, which he does as Lord Henry Wotton, he decadent aristocrat who urges Dorian to explore his vices. Ben Chaplin is also excellent as Basil Hallward, the artist who paints the portrait of Dorian and who is in love with his model.

Dorian is an orphan who inherits a fortune. Henry Wotton is only all too ready to introduce Dorian to the sensual vices. Dorian's portrait is painted by Basil Hallward, who falls in love with Dorian. It is Henry who suggests that Dorian sell his soul to the devil in return for staying young and beautiful. Dorian falls in love with a young actress, Sibyl Vane, but eventually rejects her.  Basil comes too close to the flame of Dorian's destructive ways and loses his life. Dorian eventually departs London but returns years later after Henry's baby daughter has become a young woman. It is the desire of Emily Wotton and her father to know Dorian's secrets that leads to the climax of the film.

He delivers a strong, though somewhat understated performance that should satisfy the male viewers while the females are busy feasting on his youth face and figure.

For me the real star of the film is Colin Firth in the role of Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian's mentor and probably more to the point corruptor. Firth is the Mephistopheles personified; aloft, dispassionate, articulate and totally void of any human emotion or goodness. As Lord Wotton leads Dorian on the road to perdition one cannot help but become mesmerized by the transformation that eventually leads Dorian to that unenviable place where pupil becomes the teacher.

As Faustian tale go, things do not end well for those who nail their soul to the Devil's altar. The same is true here. Ah, but taking the journey is so much fun!",1309651200,,1269,4.897674418604651

No Way does this compare to the brilliant, witty, frightening, etc. movie made way back when.  This one focuses more on the sexual deviate garbage than the whole story of ""selling your soul to the devil to stay young"".  Also, the new actors renditions cannot begin to compare with original actors: The Great Sardonic George Sanders & Hurd Hatfield.
Hollywood needs to stop trying to recreate the Old Classics: They never hold a candle to the original movie.  This dvd is so vulgar & trashy, I refuse to even donate it.

Afterward I decided to see if it was available anywhere and found it had been

original story.  My grand daughter (18) hasn't seen it yet, but will probably
be shocked that her ""old grand dad"" would have such a film in his library (lol).
It's a well-done version and I recommend it.

When I saw this movie not only had him in it, but Ben Barnes I couldn't wait to see it. I was blown away!! Barnes was absolutely brilliant as Dorian and Firth was positively delicious as his corruptor. The special effects were fresh and perfectly nasty.

3982762,4,B002SVP9GO,"2009 saw another film version of Oscar Wilde's tale of horror, originally titled ""The Picture of Dorian Gray.""  This UK film was more about Dorian than his infamous portrait.

If you read the story you got the basic idea: Dorian (Ben Barnes) arrives in London, a naive, rich boy who inherits a large house complete with servants.  But there are two men who talk to Dorian who greatly influence him: one, artist Basil, who paints the portrait and Harry (played by Colin Firth) who corrupts him.

A mild oath that the painting should remain as youthful as Dorian becomes mystical when he states he would ""nail my soul to the devil's door.""

The film proceeds to show us the destruction of Dorian -- a new love quickly fades when he begins to cheat on her (Cybil Vane, played by Rebecca Hall) -- and her fate is tied to her brother, which brother proceeds to stalk Dorian for several decades!  This part of the film felt rushed with the girl's suicide and the brother hunting Dorian -- not very enthusiastically.

No, the film was concentrating on Dorian rather than the enemies he was making.  Finally he find an intellectual equal with his friend Henry's daughter and comes to realize where the ""stench"" of his soul is coming from.

The painting itself was a bit much -- the special effects with the creepy thing coming partially out of the paiting was a bit silly.  Why not just have the painting subtly change instead?

Despite these quibbles, the acting was top notch -- you came to believe Dorian and little sympathy for him as he went off the deep end, screwing society women and making out with a few men as well -- and a horrific murder or two!

Colin Firth (Oscar winner of last year's ""The King's Speech"") was the philosophical debaucher, with tidbits like: ""Life is a moment, makit it burn always with the hardest flame.""  But his encouragement for Dorian to be immoral and cast away his ethics resulted in a pretty bad end.

Lesson learned:  Yeah, make your life a moment but combine your freedom of action with some moral bindings and give some purpose to your life.  Dorian's ""flame"", having no purpose, burned out rather quickly.

Recommended.

3982763,3,B002SVP9GO,"The biggest disappointment for me in this movie was that Lord Henry's lines, which are supposed to be funny and witty, are omitted or truncated in this version. Colin Firth is a good actor, but his lines were mangled by the writers. He'll say the first part of a paradox and then the rest of the line is omitted. Another disappointment is this version doesn't give the characters motivation for their actions. Why does Dorian break up with Sibyl? Why does he kill Basil? The 1945 version provided reasons for each action. This Dorian acts more like American Psycho, Victorian Version. They've added in traumatic childhood flashbacks. That's a symptom of our age - everything must be blamed on childhood. I found it distracting. I did think the women in this movie were well drawn, and this movie does a good job of depicting the homoerotic tensions and the luxuriant opium houses. However, there was much more to the aesthetic movement than that. This version gives us some stuff that older versions have missed, but this version loses a lot in the process.

I've always been somewhat intrigued by the story, by the mystery of it, and the fact that it's not entirely clear in any version (save maybe the book) what, exactly, happens to the main character.

My expectations were somewhat shattered when I saw this take on the story.
It's definitely more of a horror film, with very specific horror-movie gags and devices.  I'm not sure how one would take this film out of context - probably not too well - but even in context, I was not entirely impressed.

Big motivating factors for me to see it to begin with was Colin Firth and Ben Barnes' involvement, both of whom do fine (and no one is surprised) but, again, not what I expected.  In any sense.

I have since picked up the book and found that it is entirely different (and better) in every way.",1302393600,4,918,4.467065868263473
3982768,1,B002SVP9GO,"I am an admirer of the 1945 MGM version of the Wilde classic (which I read a loooonnng time ago and only vaguely remember) and found this updated, augmented treatment, well, too obvious.  I always found the mystery of the Hurd Hatfield version really intriguing.  I would think, and try to imagine, just what debauchery Dorian was about.  But this version spells it all out in big letters and it just ruins all the delicious innuendo and need for imagination.  And yeah, Dorian's exploits turned out to be just about what one might suspect but I just didn't really need them depicted so concretely.  I would have been interested in and out and out porn flick that used this plot as a point of departure (I mean a really good porn flick, not the dreck and bad acting you always find with porn or erotica.)  And if not that, then I prefer a film, ala Mr. Lewin's, which leaves just enough to one's imagination.

I really liked Hatfield's sort of flat, wooden performance as well.  His Dorian seemed a beautiful mannequin (sp?, waxen almost, and nearly devoid of feeling and emotion...which made one curious about his unseen exploits.  George Sanders does tend to blather on an awful lot at a rather rapid speed and I thought Colin Firth was easier to watch and listen to.

All in all, this remake is a real disappointment.  Give me the beauty of black and white and the subtlety of a Production Code script.",1302220800,11,1405,4.58

Barnes is miscast and out of his depth here, Firth's man is exaggerated; the daughter is non-existent in the novel, and there are plot additions that were not necessary. (Chaplin is excellent however). For now if you want to see a better version of this story, stick to Hurd Hatfield and George Sanders.",1302048000,12,414,4.684931506849315
3982770,3,B002SVP9GO,"Director Oliver Parker is not new to making films and while most of what he has made I have not heard of he has had a few films that I have. I just haven't seen any of them and none that I have heard of were in the horror genre. Off the bad this may be worrisome that someone known more for movies involving romance is doing a horror film but the amount of sleaze brought forth in the lust filled world of this film practically requires it. I can't say that he has no experience in the horror genre as he was an actor in Hellraiser, Hellraiser 2, and Nightbreed. Clearly there is a little love for the darkness of films we all love. Dorian Gray is of course based off of the original novel by Oscar Wilde about a man who would not age though the painting that was done of him did. This screenplay was written for the big screen by Toby Finlay who has done nothing before or since and I kind of hope that changes since a lot of potential was shown in this film.

While the film itself can't be said to be fully faithful to the original novel to make it the horror film that it is would be impossible to have kept it 100% in line with the original. That works perfectly though as the constant barrage of sex and violence that is shown fits exactly for how the movie itself plays out. The story focuses around Dorian (Ben Barnes) who is a young man recently come to wealth that has just arrived in the city. Here he knows not a soul or how the social structure works or how dark many of the people he is soon to meet are within their circle. He is quick to meet Basil (Ben Chaplin) a famous artist who is enamored with his looks and eventually is the one to catch his likeness on canvas. At one of the first social events he is brought to he is introduced to Lord Henry (Colin Firth) who is the embodiment of hedonism. Lord Henry quickly realizes that the young Dorian is extremely impressionable and willing to listen to nearly anything he says so tries to teach him the ways of Earthly pleasures that he lives by.

As Dorian slowly starts to succumb to the temptations of an overly sexual lifestyle it is agreed that he will allow Basil to paint him. At the paintings completion, having fallen into the lifestyle of hedonism, Dorian mentions he would sell basically attach his soul to such perfection for eternal pleasure. This is of course is exactly what happens as his soul becomes attached to the painting so that anything that is negative which he does or would happen to him in fact happens to the painting while he is left untouched.

Dorian ends up needing to kill to keep his secret and instead of feeling remorse decides to travel the world as he does not wish to be thought of as involved in that. He spends over 30 years away and when he returns his still living friends are shocked to see that he has not aged. A lifestyle of sin has completely corrupted the painting that stores his soul and when he finally finds something to live for it is predictable what befalls the painting itself. Overall it is a good tale and while the ending didn't feel right with how Dorian acted right up to it was still a fun watch.",1301788800,,3125,4.266441821247892
3982771,4,B002SVP9GO,"Dorian sells trades his soul to the devil for a lifetime of the male youth and beauty shown in his portrait. Instead, the oil ages and is defiled by Gray's wicked lifestyle. The young man is heir to Lord Kelso but is influenced by the viciously immoral suggestions of Lord Wotton (Colin Firth). Firth, like Ben Barnes playing Dorian, are hugely successful playing such dark characters. This Oscar Wilde adaptation is not the typical Victorian character for these actors, but they are successful in making the viewer disgusted with their behavior. The artist, Basil (Ben Chaplin) is another character well played although having a less involved role in this dastardly story of Victorian greed, abuses, hypocrisy, deceit, lusts, and wanton waste of the upper class.

A later arriving role of Emily is excellently played by Rebecca Hall. A significant portion of the worth of the movie, even though a much lessened amount of screen time involved.  The acting is as well done as the period setting and costuming. Be aware, if you don't know the story of Wilde's book, which this is about everything obscene that one man could experience. It's all there and shown including murder, sex, homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, smoking, language, nudity, violence, prostitution, well, now you get the picture. Dorian lusted and took it all in, that that is displayed, but in as light a form that could be used and yet get the significance of the lowness of the lifestyle of Gray across. Thus the rating R for devilishly RAW.

Lord Henry Wotton quotes: ""Life is a moment. There is no hereafter. So make it burn always with the hardest flame."" ""No civilized man regrets a pleasure.""
Gray's too late reply: ""My life has been a monstrous corruption.""

This would be considered 5-stars by those who thrive on the dark plots in film. As a classic book adaptation it is 4-stars worthy. Much of the book is quickly covered, but it is impossible to adapt a novel any other way without making it a multi-episode epic. Well done for 112 minutes.

Because the reviews on amazon.com were so positive, the prospect of seeing Colin Firth portray Lord Henry Wotton so enticing, and the price for the bluray version so affordable, I ordered it.  I invited a friend (another film buff and a big Firth fan) over to watch it with me.  After about fifteen minutes or so into it, I turned to her and said, 'This is boring!""  She agreed and summed it up perfectly...""It's so flat!""  Oscar Wilde couldn't have said it better.  Although the 1945 version with Hurd Hatfield and George Sanders was rather hammy and campy in parts, it was a much better film than this production.  It left an indelible impression for me the first time I saw it.  It visually captured the atmosphere of Wilde's novel wonderfully. The elegant cinematography, the loving attention to detail, and the fine actors made it a film I would think about and want to see again for years to come.

Angela Lansbury's Sybil Vane was touchingly moving and beautiful.  Sybil Vane in this version was unmemorable and almost superfluous.  And this character should never be considered superfluous.  Colin Firth's portrayal of Lord Wotton was woefully lacking in charisma and power.  George Sanders set a standard that few have come even close to achieving with his interpretation of Lord Wotton.  Where was this chemistry that other viewers of this film were claiming ignited between Firth and Ben Barnes?!!!  I saw none of that.  And, Ben Barnes...well...  I have yet to see a great portrayal of Dorian Gray.  Barnes was not up to the task.  Stiff and unconvincing, he was, sadly, not beautiful enough to make me believe that he could make all of society fall under his spell.  I would like to see all the other other versions of Dorian Gray that are currently available on DVD.  Perhaps in one of them is a definitive Dorian Gray.  As much as I liked the 1945 version, Hurd Hatfield was not the ideal actor for me.

By choosing to invest more time depicting the debauchery and sexuality of Dorian's corruption, the film became tedious and, ultimately, left an unpleasant impression.  We turned the movie off (about twenty minutes into it) and went on to more satisfying fare.  But I decided to give the film another chance.

3982775,3,B002SVP9GO,"I was so excited when I saw this film advertised in 2009.  Then hugely upset when it wasn't released in the US.  So, when I saw the DVD I immediately ordered it.  First off, I have to say I have never read the book, so I can't comment on how good an adaptation it is.  Like many though, I am familiar with the basic story:  young man nonchalantly offers his soul in exchange for eternal youth.  Thereafter, the painting of him takes on all his sins and ages for him.  Sounds like a great story!  Only after watching the film, I'm disappointed.

There were a lot of good things about the movie.  Colin Firth and Ben Barnes were excellent in the roles of Lord Henry Wotton and the title character.  And the supporting actors were also very good.  The setting, costumes and ambiance were fantastic.  And, I was excited to see that it was an R rated film.  A book that was so controversial, with a character so depraved, needn't be for the PG-13 set.  And, the scenes that earned the R met my expectations.  There's nudity, violence and debauchery.  And the ending was tense and exciting.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film was slow and downright boring at times!  This was surprising since the filmmaker, in the making-of featurette, admits to taking liberties with the story in the book to fit it for film. Why take liberties if you aren't going for more even pace to keep the audience engaged?

Overall, I did enjoy the film as Barnes was so exceptional as Dorian.  And, I'll probably watch it again - with my finger on the fast-forward button. As to the DVD,  it is pretty good for a single disc edition.  The making-of featurette had interviews with most of the cast, discussed the book and characters, and was well worth watching.",1298419200,13,1734,4.504823151125402

So he actually did a good job of showing the transition.  It's a first for me to see Colin Firth in a villainous role and he was impressive.  He was subtle but menacing.  This lavish version of the story of Dorian Gray is a feast for the eyes.  Excellent costume design and the different moods of the story were captured by the lighting and setting.  The only thing that I don't understand was the ending and how Colin Firth's character ended up with the portrait.",1297814400,,694,4.468253968253968
3982777,4,B002SVP9GO,"'Dorian Gray', directed by Oliver Parker, is definitely a more graphic adaptation of the spirit of the book written by Oscar Wilde. Throughout, I wondered how Wilde would react to the film, were he still with us. On one hand, I believe he would have appreciated the touch of horror; I certainly felt it in his writing. He was quoted from another of his books (Lady Windermere's Fan) ""In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it."" In this movie, the latter was certainly true for poor Dorian.

On the other hand, the book 'Picture of Dorian Gray' seemed fairly minimalist in affect (as was Barnes' interpretation of the character) so, would Mr. Wilde be a smidge put off by all the melodrama and overt sexual content? Who knows? He used a lot of symbolism and subtle innuendo in his writing, but the politics of the time could account for some of what he didn't literally spell out, I suppose. After all, he was imprisoned for his lifestyle and beliefs, for a time.

Wilde lived a deep and complicated life. His personality and character were revealed through his writing and oh, what I would have given to be on his list of friends. ""A good friend will stab you in the front."" -- Oscar Wilde

Alas, the book, in this case, pleased my pitiful imagination more than the movie. While the acting was superb, I had a difficult time reconciling myself with what I felt was an over-reach on the tenor of this great story. You know, the old 'less is more' adage. So, from me, 3 1/2 stars, rounded up.

My disclaimer to the literary elite: I am simply an appreciator of art, not a professional, so take my opinion with a grain of whatever you prefer.

3982780,4,B002SVP9GO,"This review is for those who have read the book.

I love The Picture of Dorian Gray and I know that almost always, movies are never as good as the book.  This movie is still one of those, but it's not that bad!  It follows the book with a few tweaks and changes here and there.  Dorian Gray is supposed to be so gorgeous that all people just stop, stare, and admire him.  The actor who plays him has a very Victorian look about him and if I were to ever meet him in person, I'd probably stop, stare, and admire. He also plays the part extremely well. You can actually see his transition from innocent and good to just plain bad.  Colin Firth does a pretty good job playing his friend who leads him into the darkside although I pictured someone who was more Dorian's age.  There are a few things I didn't like about the movie:

With the book, you can just imagine the bad things that Dorian does but this movie tries to show it to you which I didn't think was absolutely necessary. This goes beyond an orgy scene....it's just uncomfortable to look at but i guess it's trying to show you that Dorian Gray wants to experience all that is pleasurable and painful at the same time.  Also, the homosexual relationship between Dorian and Basil seemed forced.  I do believe Dorian was bisexual in the book, but I never once thought he felt that way towards Basil, but I guess that can be left for interpretation.  Lastly, the movie wanted you to actually feel bad for Dorian in the end, so they made up a love interest for him, but really, Dorian Gray became bad and there was just no turning back.

Still entertaining though.  It's nice that the movie took place around the actual setting of the book.",1296086400,,1694,4.356687898089172

He himself is an ""earnest young man with a beautiful nature"" who, because of his good looks is, upon his arrival in town, immediately hit upon by everyone, male and female alike.  He then unfortunately crosses paths with the morally bankrupt ""Harry"" at a party who befriends Dorian and quickly steers Dorian's nave personality towards evilness - the evil thoughts that he himself hasn't the nerve to act out.

***SPOILER ALERT!!***

Dorian has only remnants of the beatings he received in the attic (where the infamous painting is eventually kept) from his grandfather for no reason in the attic which were perpetrated on him because Dorian's mother died giving him life.  (The attic is where the infamous portrait is eventually kept.)  Harry spends an inordinate amount of time as Dorian's buddy slowly introducing Dorian to any and all debauchery he can take him to and ruining any happiness that might come to Dorian.  At first Dorian verbally fights Henry's filthy philosophies but eventually gets worn down by him.  He also thinks that, since his portrait will get the brunt of his ugly behavior, he starts to bath in these debaucheries.

The film succeeds in showing how hideous a human being Dorian becomes and how his bargain with the devil consequently putrefies his beautiful portrait with his sins.  Ben Barnes (Dorian) is the perfect choice for the classically beautiful Dorian Grey and Colin Firth, as Harry, is absolutely detestable in this film.

3982783,4,B002SVP9GO,"Everytime a movie is based on a movie, I have to hear ""THE MOVIE LEFT TOO MUCH OUT!"" I cite Harry Potter as a prime example.  But you have to understand, there is no way a well written novel can be condensed into a movie that will be a watchable length.  I personally loved the Dorian Gray novel, but have to admit the book was long winded.  There was many parts that drug on and on and really caused me to lose track of what was going on because I was kind of skimming to get to something interesting.

This movie I felt really stripped out all of the garbage and made a movie the was interesting and accurate to the original storyline.  Dorian Gray for those who don't know, is basically a story about the life of a pretty boy turned into a corrupt sex addicted (toward both men and women), opium addict, drunk, murdering, monster whose youth is forever contained through a magical transfer of his soul into a self-portrait.  There is no huge action sequence, no evil enemy to stop from taking over the world, or any majorly deep plot.  Its just about what a person with eternal youth could pull off.

Barnes played a hell of a part, and I thought was a perfect choice for Dorian.  The movie had the peverted, dark, twisted atmosphere that it needed and all the characters were excellent.  I liked the acting because everyone seemed to fit into place perfectly.

Great movie for a weekend watch, but don't expect a nail-bitter.  If you haven't read the book, I would suggest a rent first.",1293926400,,1490,4.417582417582418
3982784,4,B002SVP9GO,"The acting is superb in this very dark, intriguing adaptation of Oscar Wilde's book, The Picture of Dorian Gray. I thought the actor who played Dorian Gray did an excellent job and had the right balance of innocence and self-absorbed tendencies. I could not watch this movie repeatedly because the plot is depressing and dark, but I think that is typical of Wilde. It's worth viewing, but beware that it is not a sunny, light romantic story, but rather a serious look into what happens to a man's soul when he thinks only of himself and his pleasure.",1293926400,,550,4.622448979591836

This is a fine new version of Oscar Wilde's classic and I recommend it, but not without some reservation. (see below)

First, the good. The film has a great noir Urban Horror look, and there is careful attention to period detail. Moreover, while the novel was first published in 1891 and Wilde died in 1900, this version extends into the WWI era, which adds a nice Steampunk touch.

The acting is excellent, especially Ben Barnes, who makes a smooth and believable transition from charming innocent to monster, and Colin Firth as Dorian's mentor in evil who, like Dr. Frankenstein, comes to hate the monster he created, especially when Dorian comes ""too close to home.""

Now for the questionable elements. Both Wilde's novel and the classic 1945 Hollywood film version were made under the constraints of censorship. Consequently, most of Dorian's crimes were alluded to rather than shown. His sins were revealed through the corruption of his portrait, and much was left to the audience's imagination. In this version we see Dorian being bad in graphic detail. The ""in your face"" evil seems to undercut the subtlety of Wilde's imagery of a man who remains young, handsome and seemingly innocent, while his picture grows old, ugly and depraved-looking. Of course, we know that appearances are often deceiving, but in this version the audience is never really deceived.

This version also adds a new psychological twist, presumably to make Dorian more sympathetic. Flashbacks and scars on his back reference abuse by Dorian's grandfather who hated the boy because his mother died after childbirth. And a connection is made between the grandfather's portrait and Dorian's grotesquely transformed picture. I'm not sure I buy that, but I can understand why the filmmakers used it.

Finally, those who are interested might want to compare this version to the 1945 film, ""The Picture of Dorian Grey"". Hurd Hatfield's Dorian seemed cold and creepy from the beginning, a real contrast from Ben Barnes. But in the end he tries to reform by performing an unselfish act. Unfortunately for Dorian, it proves to be too little, too late.  And in the final analysis there is no ""excuse"" for his actions unless we empathize with someone who wishes to remain forever youthful and attractive on the surface while indulging all his darkest fantasies in secret.",1293840000,2,2511,5.374045801526718
3982786,4,B002SVP9GO,"It's been over 20 years since I read the novel, but have seen two movie versions and one musical stage version of the Dorian Gray tale.  This does a better job than most at introducing more of the subtleties that likely would have been most important to Wilde, knowing that one's work gets mercilessly cut when being developed into a screenplay.  Colin Firth, as always, gives a first rate performance as does Ben Barnes.  Also to the director's credit to not send Mr Barnes to the gym so that he has a 21st century version of the hot male physique; but trusts the actor's good looks and acting to give us a beautiful Dorian whose exterior belies his ugly soul.  The sex, violence, and gore that make the movie cross the line into the horror genre are not necessarily gratuitious, but effectively give us a more comprehensive version of the story.",1293235200,2,847,4.589403973509934

Well, what makes the film a gem? a fantastic direction from Oliver Parker and an outstanding performance from the lead guy Ben Barnes, Barnes manages to steal the show quite easily right from the very start, his performance as 'Dorian' can be said 'Impeccable' in just a word, all you can think is that he was simply destined to play 'Dorian Gray', ever bit of his emotion, from his innocence, his youthful lust to his inner psychological fears will grab your soul. The rest of the cast is brilliant and above all Colin Firth is terrific, a similarly good performance by Ben Affleck.  A dark atmosphere to the rich character development is what you will find here.

Boy, what a surprise... the movie changes everything, and almost none of it is good.  The time period is even changed - moving forward so that instead of being confronted by James Vane in an opium den, and then seeing Vane killed during a hunt, Gray is chased by Vane through the London subway system.  Ack!  But the worst offense is having Lord Henry's daughter (who???  wha???? Um, no.) fall in love with Gray.  Ben Barnes is perfectly cast as the nearly otherworldly beautiful Dorian Gray.  He is sexy and charismatic; you can easily understand the sway he held over London society.  The CGI of the painting slowly decaying and become a sinister, malevolent presence in the attic is well done, as is a much more blatant homoerotic encounter between Gray and Basil Hallward that is only hinted at in the original book.  Colin Firth phones in his appearance, which is unfortunate, because Lord Henry has, hands down, some of the best lines ever written on the page.  Firth's mumbling, grouchy style and portly physique ruin Wilde's characterization of the quintessential refined, sardonic gentleman - whose many, many witty epigrams are nowhere to be found in the movie.  If you've never read the book, the movie is worth watching to swoon over Ben Barnes, and enjoy a racy, modern interpretation of a classic gothic tale.

3982794,5,B002SVP9GO,"This movie was on the weekend deals for $0.99 and I decided to take a chance on it.  I am very glad I did, because this movie was an incredible tale.

For some reason the title jumped out at me, but I didn't understand why at first.  When I was a child, I had actually heard about this story, about the man who lives forever young, but his age and blackness is reflected in his painting.  Once I started reading the other reviews, I instantly remembered this tale from long ago, and got pretty excited to watch it.

I promptly rented it and downloaded it for viewing on my PC. (See note on this at bottom.)

I really enjoyed all of the main characters performances, I was sucked in to this world from the very beginning.  This movie excels at just crafting a gripping story and immersing you in it.

Anyways, a short synopsis; Dorian Gray inherits what appears to be a large fortune and estate from his deceased father. He travels to claim it and meets a man that pushes him in to living a life of debauchery and pleasure. After putting up some mild resistance, he finally succumbs to the temptations. A painter sees something in him and wants to paint his portrait. Dorian poses for him, and whilst conversing with his friend and the painter, his friend unwittingly proposes a very dire question with perilous consequences to Dorian.  Dorian basically trades his soul for eternal youth, but as stated above, all wounds, aging, and soul marring blackness is reflected dynamically in his painting, which he then hides and obsesses over, and guards it lethally.

So the story unfolds, and I want to write more but don't want to spoil more than necessary to get you interested in the film!

P.S. As a side note, I had problems viewing this film in the Amazon Unbox player for the first time ever.  I would get sound but no picture.  Searching help was of no assistance.  Anyways, after fiddling around, I got it to work.  If you're having problems too... try this.

I wanted to read it and was going to eventually get to reading it - when I had the time. Sadly, I have not had the time to read the book, but I did have a couple of hours to watch the movie.

As one of those lesser beings who sometimes watches a movie before reading the book, I cannot say whether this adaptation is true to the original. What I can say however is that it is a  great film. Dorian, if you haven't read the book either, is a hedonist who indulges all his whims (refer to Ecclessiastes) and having made a pact with the devil, does not suffer any of the consequences of his unbridled lifestlye on his person. Someone must pay however, and in this case it  is his portrait that suffers in his place.

Ben Barnes plays Dorian quite well I think, and Colin Firth is quite convincing as the worldly-wise mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. This is of course not a shortcut to reading the classic, but it is an excellent way to relax and perhaps, learn a thing or two about the dangers of unbridled lust.

Wilde was an incredible writer and poet and this story of sin and the supernatural is still surprisingly powerful today.  I thought they did a decent job, though I haven't seen the 1945 version.  The book (a short novel) is great though - I'd highly recommend reading that before seeing this. Imagination is still more powerful than CG technology.. and Wilde's wit and wisdom are MUCH better absorbed in the written form. It's not long and it's easy to get into (the book).

The title of the book is The Picture of Dorian Gray and is about a very handsome young english gentlemen who comes from a wealthy family.  He is having his portrait painted and while posing listens to the ravings of the artist's friend.  The friend is a Libertine at heart and freightens Dorian into selling his soul to remain youthful forever, while his portrait ages and takes on the ugliness of one who lives a life of Libertinage. Taking the advise of this Libertine Man, Dorian does follow a path of indulgence and decadence.  He becomes mad a he seeks to feed his insatiable appetite for everything. Eventually his concience catches up with him and... Well, I will leave that for you to find out.

I love this movie -not only because we get to see Ben Barnes almost totally naked, but because I think it really captures where Oscar Wilde was going with this story. Ole Oscar was no stranger to the variety of sexual pleasure, but had he written what I think he really wanted to write in Queen Victoria's England, he would have been executed instead of being sentenced to hard labor. I think that he would approve of this fantastic rendition of his book.  In this movie you really get to see how far Dorian Gray went with his immortality.  Yes ladies and gentlemen, he was involved in sexual orgies with men and women.  Hey, if i were immortal I would do the same, why limit yourself when you have money and eternal life and eternal youth and beauty.  I need to find someone to paint my portrait.

NE WAY, great cast, as I mentioned the beautiful Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian, and Stardust), the fabulous Colin Firth (Valmont, The Single Man, Bridget Jones' Dairy 1& 2, the list is too long for this great British actor),Ben Chaplin (The Truth About Cats and Dogs, Lost Souls, Murder By Numbers and The Water Horse) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (Peter Pan, and An American Haunting).

He has his portrait painted and falls under the influence of hedonistic Lord Henry (Colin Firth) who encourages Dorian to indulge his baser passions.  As the years pass, Dorian becomes cruel and violent but his appearance never changes; only his portrait reflects the soulless man he has become.

Ben Barnes is so flawlessly handsome that it's almost distracting.  He can act but lacks charisma and he's too young to play the demanding lead.  His performance is geared toward teens, I think.  On the other hand, Colin Firth is very good playing the truly loathsome puppet-master who leads Dorian down the wrong path and Ben Chaplin is great  as the portrait painter.

The Victorian period is faithfully recreated and the costumes and sets are lavish, although much of the charm is lost when the story inexplicably moves into the WWI era.

Oliver Parker has directed Oscar Wilde's plays, ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" and ""An Ideal Husband"" and now turns to his Victorian-era thriller novel, ""Dorian Gray."" It stars Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray, the absolute picture of youth and beauty whose appearance is captured exquisitely in a painting. When asked if he would give up his soul to stay the way he appears in the picture, he says he would and miraculously over time his portrait ages while he does not and Gray's pleasure-filled life spirals out of control.

When Gray arrives on the scene in London for the first time, it is after the death of his grandfather. He is swept up into lavish parties and meets Lord Henry played by Colin Firth who encourages him to indulge in every pleasurable sensation and lead the life he wishes he could. Gray is at first an innocent, but the influence of Henry is undeniable as the two continue to go out on the town. Lord Henry's friend Basil Hallward is a society artist who paints the portrait and declares it possibly his best work and doesn't understand why Gray won't let him borrow it back for a gallery show he wants to put on.

Ben Barnes is the perfect casting choice as he always seems to glow on screen amongst other characters and backgrounds. His skin appears flawless and with a minor change of expression he can express innocence and love or lust and evil. His change in character over the course of the film is haunting and it certainly helps that the story is so gripping. He rules this entire movie but it certainly helps that he has such an outstanding cast behind him.

Case in point, Colin Firth graces the cast with his presence playing a role he excels in as the guy that kind of puts everyone else off. He sweeps Dorian into the high class society encouraging a lack of morality and an excess of naughty behavior. Colin Firth sports a mustache so that is how you know he's a bad influence, but he is not all bad since eventually he has a daughter played by Rebecca Hall that he is very protective of when she becomes drawn to Dorian's charms.

Rebecca Hall is such an honest actress who puts forth so much authenticity in her characters, it's always a treat to see her. This role is more average as the quirky daughter attracted to Dorian against her father's will, but go check her out in ""Please Give"" for a really stand-out performance.

The Blu-Ray version is gorgeous. This is a movie that benefits from the Blu-Ray treatment being such an elegant period piece and it just makes Ben Barnes' face look more flawless by comparison to everyone else. This classic story modernized is a fantastic soul-selling morality piece and looks great to boot so check it out! Fascinating how new Blu-rays coming out are less expensive than their DVD counterparts....see below.

Bonus Features:

There is a making-of feature discussing the Oscar Wilde book and its translation to the big screen and how it relates to society today from the perspective of the filmmakers and cast. There are featurettes on the extensive make up and wardrobe for the other cast members until Dorian Gray's fantastic ending, the painting itself and the man commissioned to create it for them, the use of the train station/Smithfield market, and the visual effects of the painting. The costume design photo gallery features Ruth Myers' original sketches come to life played to the soundtrack from the movie.

The Deleted Scenes show Dorian Gray facing a woman on her death bed at peace, a little more background on his fiancee's brother in conversation, and an encounter with a mysterious man who seems to know something about the contract. The Blooper Reel is a very proper reel of difficulties with cigarette cases, holding a glass, peering around a corner, and small cases of giggles.",1283817600,,3822,4.709580838323354

3982811,4,B002SVP9GO,"Don't ask me why this wonderfully atmospheric big screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's macabre tale was never released in the USA, just be thankful the DVD has been.  Director Oliver Parker and screenwriter Toby Finlay have done an admirable (if not completely faithful) job of bringing Wilde's classic to the screen.

  For those unfamiliar with this story: a young gentleman has his portrait painted and, like Narcissus before him, he becomes transfixed by his own reflection.  In the case of Dorian Gray, he sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty and from that moment on his portrait alone reflects each and every physical sign of age, as well as the corruption of his soul.  Along with Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray remains the greatest Victorian gothic horror story.

  Among the many aspects that work so well in this adaptation is the casting of the comely Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) as Gray; from innocent adolescent to debauched rake to world weary immoralist, the young actor communicates the multi-faceted character with great dexterity.  Colin Firth, always dependable, adds gravity as Gray's mentor cum nemesis.  Ben Chaplin gives a strong performance as the ill-fated portrait artist and voice of morality.  The two Bens share a sexy scene of seduction, only implied in Wilde's manuscript.

  Horror fan's of Saw and Midnight Meat Train my be disappointed; those who prefer classy horror fare like The Innocents, The Haunting or the old Hammer horror films with Christopher Lee, should enjoy this.

3982812,4,B002SVP9GO,"""Dorian Gray""  is based on  Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel.  When strikingly handsome Dorian (Ben Barnes) arrives in Victorian London, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), who introduces him to the hedonistic pleasures of the city.  Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin), paints a portrait of Dorian to capture the full breadth of his youthful beauty and when it's unveiled, Dorian makes a wishful vow to give anything to stay as he is in the picture, even his soul.  His casual pledge is fulfilled when his portrait ages while he does not, and he descends down a path of horror, wickedness, debauchery, and murder in order to hide his frightening secret.

 Director Oliver Parker doesn't avoid the violent and sexual aspects of Dorian's exploits.  This Dorian is attractive to men as well as women, and he is ready, willing, and able to enjoy the pleasures of both sexes.  He's also into drugs, sadomasochism, and body piercing.

 There are elements here of ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,"" since the setting of both works is the same period and both Hyde and Dorian seek pleasure above all else.  Hyde is more the monster, but Dorian's unhealthy pursuits render him less and less human.

 The film's strong points are Firth's outstanding performance as Lord Henry and the portrayal of turn-of-the-last-century London.  Though Barnes looks the part, he is a rather colorless Dorian.  We see him engaging in all manner of vile activities, but it's as if we're watching a chalk outline go through the motions.  Where's the passion?  Fortunately, Mr. Firth digs his heels in to provide a dazzling performance of the guy who leads Dorian down the path of corruption.

 Bonus extras include audio commentary with the director and screenwriter, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.",1282780800,,1904,5.041666666666667
3982813,5,B002SVP9GO,"Anyone not familiar with Dorian Gray: Dorian has natural beauty but, in the end, all beuaty fades. But Dorian is different; Drian wants to see the world and to taste every temptation that might otherwise taint your soul. with this idea in hand, Dorian finds himself obsessed with a picture of himself and he also finds himself, or possible his essense - soul, whatever you want to call it - connected to it as well. So, the fleeting turns eternal and Dorian, beautiful Dorian, becomes the adventurer that he always wanted to be.

I recall seeing this movie a little while back, but it took some time for th emovie to land in the laps of the U.S. consumer. Out of all the Dorian Gray movies, and there are quite a few of them, this one is quite possibly one of the best around. Sure, it doesn't have all of the things that the original had. It also isn't exactly like the original in other ways, too, because a lot of the things Dorian does are not exactly hand-in-hand experiences when you walk with polite society. So, the movies we see now are always going to be different.

The one thing that most movies lack are a good Dorian and a good secondary character as well. Here, however, we find ourselves entertained and tipping our hats to performances that make you think ""finally."" Instead of the bad dialog that often comes with the tale, you have great acting, great timing, and the temptation that should be there.
Honestly, it shows both sides of the spectrum and it shows them pretty well.

For those who want an exact replica of the book, good luck with that one. I have always thought that would be interesting but, alas, it never seems to happen. For those that can forgive a few things and can see the fdifferential that slides here, you will like this set-up. I actually went and picked it up because of what I had already seen, wanting it at my house.
Happy daze - recommended.",1282780800,,1890,4.472463768115942
3982814,5,B002SVP9GO,"The soul of Oscar Wilde's scandalous and captivating novel is alive and well in 2010.  The latest film version of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" took my breath away.  It is a different beast from Wilde's original novel, but it is no less majestic for its transgressions.  The decadence is captivating, and the artistic expression is superb.  Oliver Parker has shaped a masterpiece, manipulating an unforgettable tale and perfectly adapting it to film.  What is important about Parker's film is that it projects the sensationalism and sensibility of the 1890 gothic story into the contemporary world, while remaining faithful to the culture that inspired the original manuscript.  Yes, many aspects are unfaithful to the narrative as it is published under Wilde's name, but Dorian is not frequently known for his loyalty.

I truly cannot praise this film enough.  As a faithful Wilde devotee, I highly recommend all others with even a passing interest seek out this visual, musical, and narrative masterpiece.",1282608000,7,1006,5.204968944099379

8379683,3,B002SVP9GO,"Ben Barnes has more than his share of boyish good looks and he capably enacts both Dorian's initial naivete and his eventual heartlessness.  The screenwriters have deprived Colin Firth of most of Lord Henry's bubbly but biting conversation and have made him dark and malicious.  The screenwriters also try to make Dorian's depravity as graphic as possible--they seem to think that the only way to seek sensation is to use drugs and have sex.  The murder is unnecessarily bloody.  His disposal of the body departs from the novel and thereby excises one of the more dramatic scenes--Dorian's cajoling and eventual bullying of his former friend into making the corpse go away.  Dorian's flight from James Vane and the frantic final rush of everyone to the attic room belong in a different movie.  The film might be honestly marketed as ""inspired by"" or ""suggested by"" the novel.",1527724800,,875,4.958904109589041

8379687,4,B002SVP9GO,"Very good movie. Ben Barns is GORGEOUS in it! I admit, I'm not a fan normally at all of movies with graphic sex scenes, but in a case like this-where it seems to fit the story, I can handle it. I also believe the movie only showed what the book went around. Anyone else think so? Think Lord Henry realized in the end that it was his own influence that corrupted Dorian? He seemed to enjoy living vicariously through Dorian. I think Colin Firth was right in the interview where he called  it self-destruction by proxy. Dorian said the end that he was everything Lord Henry was afraid to be, and I believe he was right. Basically think then, that Lord Henry knew he had to destroy what he had created? Also, think it's safe to say Dorian most likely was abusive to women, especially the prostitutes he saw? I'm actually surprised we never saw him slapping any of them across the face, or even beating some of them up. He seemed to have a temper to where he would do so. My guess is he is supposed to have, but it just wasn't shown. Probably wouldn't be a surprise if he had raped some of them, and even possibly beaten some of them to death. Anyone else think so? Even the prostitutes who seemed to be having a good time with Dorian, I  wonder if most likely he had beaten up on them?  Emily was a rarity, definitely a more independent woman for the time. I wonder how Dorian would have treated her? I think she was a woman who would not have up with it if he abused, which sadly most woman did back then. My guess is Sybil would have put up with it. that was really when Dorian lost his innocence, was when hurt Sybil. I wonder if he ever thought of her, and their unborn child? Her being pregnant was obviously why she was begging Dorian to marry her.",1522627200,,1751,4.236526946107785

This movie could have been so much more.",1517616000,,259,3.980769230769231
