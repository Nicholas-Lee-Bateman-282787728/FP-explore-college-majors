8585590,4,B00CS7PI78,This is a very entertaining movie. It's quite simple in plot and leaves you feelin' good that you watched it. I watched it particularly because I very much enjoy one of the female actresses in the film but wound up enjoying the movie too. I recommend it for wholesome watching with a purpose.,1419465600,,292,4.528301886792453
8585591,3,B00CS7PI78,"Perhaps an editor to liven this somewhat dragging and at times boring edition of the overbearing matriarch and her put upon family.

Sonia Braga, who I've enjoyed over the years, stars as the mom who's trying to influence her successful but unmarried daughter's life.  Find her the right man.  There's romance, light family drama, and upper middle class, sitcom-like situations that I didn't find that amusing.

The actors are handsome, the writing insipid. Overall, I didn't dislike the movie, and in general, I enjoy the clean, lighthearted fare offered by Hallmark and Gaiam, but this flick lacks energy.  The effort at being cute or clever falls flat.  As the mom says, ""Get me the paddles!"", i.e., it needs a good jolt.

They play Latin music in the background but don't really stress the culture other than with slight accents or a few Spanish words.  Something's missing, and it'll be me watching it again.  2 1/2 stars, make it 3 for a nice group of actors.",1379980800,,965,4.8
