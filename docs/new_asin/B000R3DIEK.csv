8198703,1,B000R3DIEK,"Everyone around Holly tells her she is killing her baby and abortion is the wrong thing to do. Surprise!  She has regret after the procedure. Holly turns to drugs and alcohol because her friends and family all tell her how terrible she is for making the choice she did. I hated how nobody supported Holly. She needed their love and honest support, not their scorn and shame. Holly goes to a CPC which is not a health center, has no credentialed nurses or doctors, are legally allowed to lie to women, and are church based, state and federally funded organizations designed to dupe women away from abortion clinics. A 'counselor' at the CPC eventually makes Holly feel better emotionally.

So really, the moral of this story is:

A) Don't ever trust your friends and family with a decision or choice that you have made and they don't agree with

B) Lies can both destroy and comfort someone

C) Anything others have regretted should be made illegal: tattoos, piercings, marriage, children, divorce, dating, smoking, alcohol, drugs, guns, sex, religion, travel, shopping, driving, and joining the military are just a few examples. Of course, some of these are or have once been prohibited with disastrously failed results.",1411084800,,1220,4.931707317073171

The vast majority of women do not regret getting abortions and there is no evidence supporting the insinuation that women who get abortions suffer mental health issues as a result.

Also, those crisis pregnancy centers scam women into coming in, provide false medical information, use taxpayer money to proselytize and make obscene amounts of money on sketchy adoptions.

8198705,3,B000R3DIEK,"I was surfing the tv (is it okay to use ""surfing the tv""?) when I saw this movie being played. Overall, it's ok. I can see they used their small budget well, the characters are ok, most being a little more than wooden, and the topic, while a bit touchy, is addressed well enough that young people will learn something out of it. But there's only one reason I watched this, and all you otakus (anime and manga fans)out there will get excited... Vic Mignogna is in this. And he's the best actor!
Yes Vic, the talented, suave, and genius voice actor of anime plays Holly's father. He portrays him very well, so well in fact, that he made me cry. I repeat, HE MADE ME CRY. If he can do that, he can do anything!
As for the rest of the movie, if you can stand some of the acting and the subject, it's worth a watch. I understood more about teen pregancy and abortions better now than ever. I think it'd be good for churchs and youth small groups. And being a Christian myself, I'm can see it happen.",1317427200,,994,4.209424083769633
