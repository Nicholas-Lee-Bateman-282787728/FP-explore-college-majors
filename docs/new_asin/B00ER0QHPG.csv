8608607,3,B00ER0QHPG,This is a patchwork documentary I suggest watching if you have some time to burn. Many may look at this film and see the dark elements of activism. Extreme activism can be dark by nature as it is a formulation of bizarre love and passionate hate. What I feel the viewer is exposed is the world of BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER. People wonder how someone could be such a conflicted chameleon. The world of Darby is knowing the borderline personality--one given and receiving personified love and hate.,1522454400,,502,4.848837209302325
8608608,5,B00ER0QHPG,"I was somewhat aware of Mr. Darby's contributions to society prior to viewing this video, but it gives a very detailed look into the darker side of activism and the perils of being associated with those individuals. The only criticism I have, is it doesn't tell enough of his story, as I know there must be a lot more behind this man's unusual life. Fascinating look at the difficult and heroic decisions he made to save lives.",1475366400,,427,4.558441558441558
8608609,5,B00ER0QHPG,"Excellent film about an FBI agent-provocateur who infiltrated left-wing activist groups in Austin, Texas and New Orleans.  The director provides the informant with plenty of camera time, enough to hang himself.  Unfortunately, Darby continues his work as a right-wing agent and apparently has had some role in stirring up right-wing attacks against Obama about the humanitarian crisis of child immigrants on the Texas border.",1404345600,,425,5.625
8608610,4,B00ER0QHPG,"I watched this documentary the day after the `NATO 3'--the three loudmouthed activists who were charged as terrorists after being encouraged by undercover police officers to pour gasoline into empty bottles during the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago--were sentenced to several [more] years of prison.

The NATO 3 case is very similar to a case during the 2008 Republican National Convention when a couple of young activists were arrested and sent to prison after creating some Molotov cocktails which they intended to use to damage empty police cars. In that case, the suspects were betrayed by an FBI informant who was a member of their activist group and acted as their mentor.

That informant, the infamous Brandon Darby, is the subject of this excellent documentary by Jamie Meltzer. In his review of Informant for his Vice blog, DJ Pangburn calls it an ""unnecessary film"" and a ""failure of a documentary"" charging that it merely provides Darby with a platform from which to spout his narratives. As Panburn puts it, ""it's Brandon Darby's world, and we all are just living in it.""

Kris Hermes, in his review on Huffington Post, makes the same complaint, that Meltzer allows Darby too much control of the film's narrative: ""it's almost as if Darby decided one day to call up his friend Jamie Meltzer to let him know about a great movie idea."" Allowing him a voice in yet another documentary, Hermes asserts, merely fortifies Darby's cult of personality

And they're right, the film is largely a mouthpiece for Darby (although it also provides context and tells the story through entertaining re-enactments and interviews). But that's also what makes the film so valuable--not to mention just plain interesting. We could all benefit from learning how to avoid the Brandon Darbys of the world, and understanding his motivations can be helpful toward that end. There are also important lessons all activists should learn from the entire Darby saga. The insights in both Pangburn and Hermes reviews are examples in themselves of how useful the documentary is.

The story of Informant begins with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Darby sets out from Austin to rescue his friend in New Orleans. Darby becomes an early member of the Common Ground Collective (CGC), an anarchist relief organization. Despite the efforts of law enforcement, the CGC was successful at providing basic aid, emergency clinics, and all sorts of other help to distressed residents of the Lower Ninth Ward and other parts of New Orleans.

After a trip to Venezuela, disillusioned with his plans of becoming a revolutionary (including dreams of overthrowing the U.S. government and elaborate prison breaks), Darby had apparently become bored with helping people and thought he would feel more important if he became a crusader against terrorism. He told the FBI that his friend and anti-Israel activist, Riad Hamad, was planning on using the charity he ran to fund Palestinian suicide bombers. This lead the FBI and IRS to raid Hamad's home in search for evidence of tax fraud. A few days later, Hamad's body was found floating in a lake, dead of an apparent suicide.

Darby had found a new purpose for his life. At the request of the FBI he then set himself up as a mentor to several young activists, including David McKay and Bradley Crowder, and worked to get them imprisoned. After the 2008 RNC incident, Darby made a career going around speaking to Tea Party conventions about how he had managed to stop a militant plot to blow up delegates and Republicans.

The best way to describe Darby's underlying psychology is the phrase used by Pangburn in his review: ""an opportunist with a hero complex.""

Lessons

Other than being on guard against charismatic, borderline-sociopathic opportunists with hero complexes, I think there are two important lessons pointed out by Informant.

The first is the danger of machismo to young male activists. One reason Darby was able to exert so much influence over McKay and Crowder is that they looked up to him as an experienced and macho activists, and he chided them for not being manly enough. Would-be revolutionaries talking about the importance of manliness should be a major red flag to anarchists. As Thomas Hintze noted in his review of Informant for Waging Nonviolence, ""The macho culture created by activists in different spheres made it impossible to hold Darby accountable for his actions. It may have even given him impunity.""

Second, during all of his verbal thrashing around to find rationalizations for his own actions, Darby actually hits on some good points. One is that there is only a thin line between being a revolutionary and being a gangster, between being a freedom fighter and being a terrorist. Anybody with romantic ideas of revolution would be wise to spend some effort working through those distinctions and tensions.

There is a more balanced documentary about Bradley Crowder and David McKay,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Better-This-World/dp/B00827OWWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Better This World</a>&nbsp;(2011), which is also worth watching.

As an antidote to Darby's reality distortion field, I also recommend reading Lisa Fithian's (often first-hand) account of events: ""FBI Informant Brandon Darby: Sexism, Egos, and Lies""",1398470400,,5324,5.211695906432748
8608611,1,B00ER0QHPG,I really disliked this movie... the primary character's role in the movie changed often. Didn't seem to really have a plot... just randomly rambled on from one scene to another.... Obviously I didn't see it through the same eyes as those that gave such high ratings. We're we watching the same movie????? Waste of time and money....,1393632000,,332,4.842105263157895
8608612,5,B00ER0QHPG,"This story will stay with me forever, remembered every time someone claims an issue, an ideology or a person is unmovable black-and-white, all good vs all bad, because such rigid divides simply do not exist.  Ineffective protest is that which does not express a concrete goal.  Violent protest serves only to create fear of violence, which shames only the violent-doer, not the intended perceived enemy.  There is a grain of truth in every exaggeration and outright lie; the hard part is figuring out which is which.

Documentaries on extreme leftists, such as the Weather Underground, contained little more than spouting of political clichs by groups responsible for public violence. This film allows all sides to speak and it utterly fascinating.  I'd even recommend this be shown to the passionate and dangerously nave in high schools and college, as an invaluable lesson on human nature.",1381104000,3,891,5.159722222222222
8608613,1,B00ER0QHPG,"This review contains what is considered ""plot spoilers."" Since this is a documentary of events that have happened, I consider the ending a foregone conclusion.

This is a lower tier documentary. It is like someone describing a football game he was in while showing you pictures of the stadium and players when it was over. Brandon, a white guy from Texas, becomes appalled that white communities post Katrina formed groups of vigilantes patrolling their own neighborhoods. He doesn't trust government, so he opts to help the Ninth Ward district on his own, because as a private citizen he can do more than FEMA and the Red Cross combined. Brandon is clearly not a rocket scientist. There are topographic reasons while this lower district should not be rebuild, i.e. it won't stay above water much longer, but to many people it is home, even those without gills.

Brandon attracts the attention of the FBI and agrees to play a snitch. He infiltrates a group of Austin anarchists who want to disrupt the GOP convention in St. Paul, a small group out of 1,000s of protestors. This group decides to cross the line on activism, something Brandon could have easily prevented being a role model, but he chose not to. Instead he allowed them to create a situation that needed to be stopped. Some call it patriotism, others call it entrapment. If a man starts a fire, then puts it out himself do we praise him as a firefighter or curse him for being an arson?

Being outed, Brandon has screwed his life up so much that the only people who would talk to him was the Tea Party, which seemed to mesh with his intellect and desire to destroy government from the right instead of the left. Near the end of the feature,in the back ground on the radio, you hear the voice of Amy Goodman of the far left talking about the Brandon. I found the film rather boring because I am not Brandon Darby.

Tea Party activists will hold this feature up as a triumph, while progressives will find it comical.",1380326400,2,1978,4.610795454545454
8608614,5,B00ER0QHPG,"This documentary is, at its core, about the stories people tell to themselves and others about their actions and place in the world. The director did a terrific job letting Mr. Darby express the painful and emotional arc of his career as an activist then an informant, juxtaposing his former anarchist and leftist friends throughout as contrary and interrogative voices. The film pressed home for me the messy and contingent nature of the political and moral spheres - yet for all that, at the end of the day, we are still compelled to act by what our best lights demand of us. That is the moral of Mr. Darby.
  I would have liked to have seen more on what attracted Darby to Andrew Breitbart's Tea Party conservative populism. The irony that the so-called Tea Party is more in line with his original populist, anarchist, grassroots ideals than the Leftist power structures he came in contact with is a rich mine for, I hope, more analysis in future works.",1379808000,6,956,4.684523809523809
