2772529,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"I am 100% raw  since Oct 2007 and never had the pleasure of knowing Ann Wigmore and have not yet visited the institute.  This DVD made me feel supported and excited for a future visit!  I teach Raw food prep classes and am a chef and I learned many new tips from this DVD.  The teachers are informative and loving, I KNOW the information to be true and of benefit to everyone's health, and it's presented in a breezy, enjoyable format that is easy to follow and understand.  This is a wonderful tool for your own living foods journey, whereever you are on the path.  Buy these as gifts for your beloved family members and friends and give them the gift of health for the rest of their lives.",1245196800,7,691,4.317829457364341
2772530,4,B000NO1ZBQ,This DVD is very informative. By actually seeing the recipes made helped at lot. Although I could not understand one person's speech very well. But I would recommend this DVD to any one wanting the living foods lifestyle.,1238371200,11,221,4.842105263157895
2772531,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"""This DVD is a super value! (It's two and a half hours.) I had such a good time
watching it that I invited friends over to watch the first half as a movie night
party. Then I hosted a recipe party where we followed along and made Energy Soup
and Rhio's raw pizza. Everybody loved it!""

I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!",1226188800,19,309,4.15
2772532,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"I have read several of Ann Wigmore's books and they have changed my life..once I left behind cooked food I feel so much healthier, energized, more clarity..What i love about this dvd is it introduces viewers to Ann Wigmore's health institute in Puerto Rico..beautiful scenic viewing..interviews are done with guests taking the 2 week course in learning about the live food lifestlye and you watch them as they learn to cook, recipes are given and demonstrated on how to prepare..they cover planting and composting..how to sprout etc. It is wonderful to watch the dvd in comparison to reading a book as you feel you are right there with them learning about the live food lifestyle. Highly recommended, especially if you are new to the live food evolution",1217116800,26,753,4.937007874015748
8179595,5,B000NO1ZBQ,This dvd was made some time ago. It is a good video but the place is not exactly as it looks on the DVDs. It's still a great place to go though if you're looking to detox and get healthy and learn how to live and eat healthy,1459382400,,224,3.6875

8179597,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"This is a very good and informative DVD ... it gives you the overall lifestyle tips to staying raw and healthy just as Ann Wigmore believed in. However, with that being said, I'm not crazy about the lady who is doing the interview ... seems she's more interested in stuffing her face.  My favorite part is with Hetta, the marathon runner and he way of composting the wheat grass trays ... and for that segment alone, I am buying again.  This is a great video to play in the background when people come over ... it just might convince them to try 1 thing of all the suggestions.",1424217600,,577,4.333333333333333
8179598,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"It was like watching an infomercial.  In fact, I am pretty sure I just watched an infomercial, but PERSEVERE  after the somewhat ""painful"" interview with the directors, eventually you do get to the meat of the institute and some of the actual processes and premises behind Ann Wigmore's Puerto Rico location are finally shared.  In the end, it still is mostly information about why YOU should pay over 2K to fly to Puerto Rico to partake.  Very upbeat but definitely dated performance by the hostess, still, if you get it, watch the entire thing, if you know nothing about cleanses or wheatgrass or rejevelac this info will be enlightening.",1421712000,,640,4.844036697247707
8179599,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"I found this dvd quite informative and helpful in getting started with Raw Foods.  It includes not only recipes and information about what a
raw food diet is and why to eat that way, but also gives recipes/procedures for making various foods.  Great intro to fabulous, nutritious foods!",1351555200,,286,4.9375
8179600,5,B000NO1ZBQ,The video started much like a travel ad....but found to be very informative after the initial commercial.,1266883200,4,105,5.235294117647059
8179601,2,B000NO1ZBQ,"I am very disappointed at the amount of this video that was just an advertisement for the facility, testimonials included.  I can not believe I paid for a video that was trying to sell me something else.  I fast forwarded through much of the video once I realized what the deal was.

Now that I have vented, I will admit that at the end of the video there were a few recipe demonstrations that seemed would be good.

I did not like this DVD and can not recommend it.  I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs. My top picks for more are Raw Food Made Easy by Jenny Cornbleet and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen. Both are currently available through Amazon with a coordinating cook book.  Now I am tring to get you to buy something else, but you did not have to pay for the review.",1259193600,18,781,4.173333333333333
8179602,5,B000NO1ZBQ,""" I have read many books and seen several DVDs on raw food, but really enjoyed this one. The recipes  were really easy to follow and I learned a lot of new information from the classes.""  I give it 5 stars!",1252195200,4,206,4.0
8179603,5,B000NO1ZBQ,"This DVD is really fun to watch because it was filmed at the Retreat in Puerto Rico, and the teachers there give concise explanations that are easy to understand. My Wife makes the Energy Soup recipe now instead of juicing, and we're planning to go down there this Winter. You can see excerpts from the DVD [...]",1251504000,5,312,4.491228070175438
8179604,2,B000NO1ZBQ,I thought this DVD would be sort of a documentary but it turned out to be a two and a half hour infomercial. I give it two stars because some of the class excerpts were kind of interesting.,1246579200,10,189,4.0
