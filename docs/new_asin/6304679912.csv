904488,2,6304679912,"This is quite possibly the worst screenplay ever; loose ends abound.  It plays like a dream which jumps from one plot element to the next and never returns.  Add to this the ho-hum acting, and you'd expect a really rotten  movie.  However, it is worth watching at least once for its visual effects  which were quite good for the early 1950's.  Between the silliness of the  script and the interesting space effects, I'd recommend this movie for  anyone who ever intentionally watched 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and enjoyed  it.",918259200,11,526,4.7555555555555555

904771,2,6304679912,"I have a very time finding something to praise for this Galaxy Pictures film (released by Lippert Pictures). Though it has a woman in command of the moon voyage in the form of Colonel Briteis, in the end she requests her co-worker be promoted to Brigadier-General before she agrees to marry him. Does she want to be in charge or not? In the end, no, she wants a man to order her around. Feminists will be steamed seeing this. The special effects are bad and there are ridiculous scenes of Colonel Briteis sitting in front of a screen changing the scenes for no reason. Much of the script is half-baked--in spite of Heinlein's name in the credits--and unconvincing. Much the best part is the film opens from the point of view of ""the enemies of Freedom"" trying to sabotage the mission. Maybe the film would have been better if it stayed at the ""enemies of Freedom"" POV. The film is a victim of Cold War politics and is hard to watch now. Also it is too short at 63 minutes. Perhaps it was the initial chapter of a serial--that would have been interesting; perhaps a 1953 version of ""Space:1999"" would have resulted. Come to think of it, ""Space: 1999"" was better than this. The villain is found out too easily and too conveniently dies falling off a rocky hill on the moon. The film had much potential that failed to follow through. I suspect if they added half an hour and improved the special effects just a little it would have been a classic. This is no classic, this is a bad movie. And to compare it to Kubrick's ""2001"" is worse than ludicrous. I would have liked to see Colonel Briteis slug the guy for being the jerk he was. But women aren't supposed to beat up men, more's the pity.",1397260800,,1689,4.416666666666667
904772,3,6304679912,"What I noticed about this picture, not to be crude, are the typical 1950's mammalian protruberances on the female lead. The thin t-shirt she's adorned in leaves nothing to the imagination and every scene she appears in is lit to display her assets, which are remarkably well-formed, pert and widely placed on her torso. It is like looking through a 1950s Playboy magazine. She has a remarkably distinct set of mammary glands, and this movie spends an awful lot of time with the female lead, Donna Martell, centered in view.

The special effects are actually pretty good, if very simple. Great music. The acting is awful, there's no way around that. The story is immaterial. This DVD is worth collecting.

904904,3,6304679912,"Space station built!  What next?  Go to the Moon or to Mars?  In this 1953 movie, it's the Moon first!

Moon vehicle (Magellan): The crew compartment sits atop a 3-legged framework enclosing 6 fuel tanks with a single thruster.  Crew capacity: 3.

Mission: Undock from station, orient for translunar injection, fire engine until attaining a circumlunar trajectory.  Once behind the Moon, photograph its surface, and then continue on a free-return trajectory back towards Earth, brake for insertion into the station's Earth orbit and dock.

Colonel Briteis: command pilot.  She was the first astronaut to orbit the Earth.  Originally, Major Moore was scheduled for that flight, but then it was decided that Briteis would be the better choice.  Unfortunately, this chilled their romance.

Major Moore: copilot.  Originally slated to be pilot, he was replaced by Colonel Briteis.  Now their romance is downright polar!

Doctor Wernher: mission scientist.  He may be a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball fan, but we will never know.

General Greene: USSF SPACOM commander.  He is humorously unaware of his nonprofessional conduct.

Overall, Project Moonbase is a good movie.  It is pure science fiction with reasonable extrapolations of science and technology into the future of 1953.  Unfortunately the shoddy sets, the cheap special effects (with a few exceptions), and weak acting by some detract from the film.  There are some silly elements, the silliest occurs when rockets are firing; even if you have seen this movie several times, you are still going to laugh.

Finally, the mission goes awry, and Magellan lands in a deep crater on the western edge of the moon.

Picture: good.  No cropping.  Sound: good.  Volume: low.

The year is 1970 and the US has built a space station which can be used as a platform for the mission of orbiting the moon. This is only the first step in building a movement based military station. Yet there are those who are opposed to the US being there and will do everything in their power to sabotage the station. Can they do this and how will they do this?

Mean time Maj. Bill Moore's (Ross Ford) debut as the rocket Cmdr. has been usurped by his arch rival Col. Briteis (Donna Martell). Watch as their rivaling banter turns into something more serious.

This film looks like it was put together from a Saturday afternoon series. However I don't remember seeing anybody in scanty T-shirts. The dialog is a little stilted and the technology little hokey. However even though you can anticipate what's going to happen it's fun to see it in action. You'll see quite a few cliffhangers and might have to cover your kid's eyes during the gushy scenes or at lease plug their ears.

But a mechanical problem forces the craft to land on the Moon's surface and the race is on to solve several mysteries - that includes espionage and plans in the Soviet Union to derail the U.S. project - while rescuing the astronauts.

Author Robert A. Heinlein co-wrote the screenplay (based on a story he penned), with the ""film"" - edited pieces of an unsold Sci-Fi television series, Ring Around the Moon - being released in 1953. Directed by Richard Talmadge, it features women in a variety of top leadership positions - on the mission and in politics - while exploring the possibilities of space travel in a realistic manner.

Through the Sci-Fi genre, it ultimately is a neat peek into the concept of leadership - for a change - through a superpower rivalry on Earth that takes spycraft into outer space.",1234224000,6,922,4.720496894409938

904959,5,6304679912,"I never read a book from Heinlein I didn't like.  Of course his earliest ones are my favorite.  Everybody is over educated, in fine shape, and ready for the next opportunity to spring into action.  He and Roddenberry were both optimistic--hope I spelled his name correctly--but in Heinlein's books it showed you how to do it.

Heinlein's earlier books allowed women to have any job they were qualified for.  They had to have the education as well as be in good shape.  I think the good shape was a package deal--mind and body go together and enhance each other.  After all, a person keeping themself in good condition meant self restraint as well as determination to succeed.  Secretly, of course, the men always ruled the world.  Nevertheless the cuties had a slice of the pie and the responsibitly it cost.

PROS:

1.  Heinlein wrote it and must have been around when they shot it.

2.  Col. Briteis (pronounced Brighteyes) is a cutie and yes they are bright eyes--she is also a proper-girl in the military.  No 'hanky panky' with her.

3.  This film proves what I've always said, short-shorts look better on the ladies and strange on men.

4.  I've read a complaint about everybody wearing that skull cap.  You should read Heinlein's Have Spacesuit will Travel, it explains these things in detail.  But here is the short version--you can't have long hair in a space suit, if just one hair falls across the faceplate seal or helmet seal you loose air pressure and die.  You'll notice all our original astronauts not only wore the same cap but cut their hair off.  In the movie Starship Troopers, you remember the girl starship pilot?  Well, in the book she shaved her head (for a different reason).  This is the way science goes--you pay the price or someone else goes.

5.  Heinlein, as I remember when I read his 38 or 39 novels was always proper in his earlier novels so of course when they crash/land on the moon and, could not be rescued for weeks or long months, they must get married.

six.  Yes, there is an enemy agent onboard--he's out of shape and a bit 'slow'.

7.  Nice sharp image, neat idea.

8.  If you read the earlier reviews you see complaints about 'spanking'.  I'm 54 years old now but was young once.  Back then, several times, I remember waggeling my index finger in females face--right in front of their nose--and told them if they didn't stop I'd spank them like a little girl.  Such where the way things used to be--now you go to jail for it.  Back then usually they'd throw their cute little noises up in the air and snort. Other times they'd twirl around and 'throw over their shoulder' ""No you won't.""  Then that nose would go up in the air and snort in a girly way that pretty much spelled out ""You wouldn't dare!""  Then there were the other type girls that would take a slap at you.  Basicly there were no complaints from either side...I guess it must have been dieing out about that time because it didn't last very long.

9.  In the movie the spacestation shoots smaller rockets to them and 'Brighteyes and her new man' land them by radio remote control.  That was like Heinlein.  It's quicker to just rocket them supplies until a new ship can be built rather than risk more lives with an untried, slapped together, spaceship rescue mission.  And besides, they decided to build their first moonbase there.

CONS:

1.  Should have been a hour longer.

So there it is, another classic.  One written by Mr. Heinlein in his typical style.  I recommend this movie and all his books.  This is a one bowl of popcorn and one half hot dog move.  Why half a dog?  Most of it is spelled out to you. Bye!",1176681600,6,3627,4.515432098765432
904960,3,6304679912,"Curious thing about this film.  It made an effort to be accurate.  At least as accurate as the gut-level understanding of space flight could be in the early 1950's.  There was an effort made to show the loss of a ""ground reference"" in (what we now call micro-gravity), and by golly there is no sound in the vacuum of space.  There was no rocket roar from the ships in transit to space station, and the moon.  Wireless telephones are in evidence, but they will make the viewer laugh...out loud!  Aside from the ""technical"" efforts at accuracy, the socio-political content was woefully juvenile.  This is post-McCarthy era science fiction.  There are evil commies, and there is no domestic security available to intercept their plot in a timely fashion.  There is a woman space commander, but the then extant culture was unable to cope with such a concept (Robert Heinlein was apparently struggling just to allow a professional woman in this script.)  She does look great in the cuffed hot-pants that are the speculated unisex ship-board attire.  The guys look dumb in the same outfit.

Watch this film.  It is a history lesson.

Really!",1171584000,13,1135,4.84375
904961,3,6304679912,"This has to be one of the cheesiest science fiction films I've ever seen. It's certainly no PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE but it would be stretching a point to even call it a B movie. That is surprising seeing as how Robert A. Heinlein is credited as one of the creators. He had little time for cheesiness.

The story is a simple one of conceived in the cold war. The US is sending a reconnaissance ship around the moon to gather information prior to a landing attempt. The Soviets are desperate to stop the effort and infiltrate an agent onto the crew as a saboteur. He is not caught out soon enough and, in the chaos of the fight, the ship goes off course. The only choice for survival is to go ahead and land.

There is more going on in the story than just the race to the moon and the cold war. The mission was originally assigned to an up and coming major (male). For political reasons, he is reassigned as co-pilot and command is given to a woman, a Col. Briteis (pronounced ""Bright Eyes""). She is not a bad woman but it is apparent that she has been promoted to colonel for PR reasons and because she looks good in a skirt. Her indecisiveness and tendency to turn towards her co-pilot for advice and help is somewhat demeaning of what women are able to accomplish.

Possibly the silliest thing about the film is the costumes. The uniform for the US Space Force seems to be shorts, a t-shirt and the dumbest looking skullcap ever to grace the screen. The sets are fairly low budget as well.

All of that seems bad but I did find the show entertaining to a degree. It captured the spirit of the 50s and was fun in small doses. The ""science"" is rudimentary but generally correct. That must be Heinlein's doing. I suspect a female commander and a female US president were also. This show, while not as technically excellent as DESTINATION MOON, did have more of a story to it.",1146787200,3,1873,4.3428571428571425
904962,3,6304679912,"I saw this movie when it was released.  For some reason, it always stuck in my mind.  I viewed it after buying it from Amazon and realized it was (now) rather hokey.  Nevertheless, there were avant garde elements incorporated in Robert Heinlein's script that help the film maintain an interest level.",1127260800,3,300,4.8431372549019605
904963,3,6304679912,"Shorts, tight t-shirts and funky skull caps are the uniform that will be worn for space flight in the 1970's. Actually this movie was somewhat accurate in the depiction of space flight. As seen through the eyes of people in the 50's im sure this was pretty high tech thinking. A commie spy forces a landing on the moon and the astronauts must find a way to survive for they cant get back to the space station. All in all a charming slice of cheese from a time at the hight of the cold war.",1039824000,26,489,4.157894736842105
904964,4,6304679912,"As a 1953 follow-on to the 1950 Destination Moon (see also), this work is interesting in that it features the va-va-va-voom Donna Martell as Heinlein's typically strong but ultimately submissive female lead. Not necessarily bad unless you're a feminist, I guess; still she, like other Heinlein heroines, comes across sharp as a tack compared to the rather obtuse hammer-sack jocks she's compelled to work with.
The paternal commander played by Hayden Rorke (aka Dr. Bellows in I Dream of Jeannie) is obviously a stand-in for Heinlein himself -- think of SiaSL's Jubal Harshaw in uniform -- who bizarrely shows his kink in threatening to spank his unruly female subordinate. Definitely creepy.
This work anticipates Kubrick's 2001 etc by 15 odd years, but scans like the other straightforward, stiffly acted clunky space operas typical of the time. The plot and situations are adult and so I would not recommend this movie for preteens.",1032912000,42,935,5.157894736842105
904965,5,6304679912,"Somehow this movie never played on TV in my locale (Milwaukee/Chicago) when I was a horror-crazed kid (unlike apparently every other cheap SF flick of the period). For fans of low-budget 1950s space operas this is a terrific find. Project Moonbase neatly straddles the fence between ""serious"" science-fact specimens such as Destination Moon or Riders to the Stars and tacky ""babes in space"" fare like Cat Women of the Moon or Queen of Outer Space. It shares a similar look and feel with all those films and other typical titles of the era from Astor, Allied Artists, UA, and other independents, such as Missile to the Moon, Fire Maidens of Outer Space, War of the Satellites, etc. Co-written by pioneering modern SF icon Robert Heinlein (Destination Moon, The Puppet Masters, Starship Troopers) and low-budget western producer Jack Seaman, PM contains enough sober ""speculative fiction""/rocketry tech stuff to satisfy hardware geeks as well as plenty of cool atomic-age design and forehead-slap-inducing sexism (""I ought to turn you over my knee and spank you"") for irony-wallowing bad cinema fanatics. `Genre' names peppering the credits include director Richard Talmadge (the silent movie star, stunt man, and 2nd unit director); Ed Wood's house cinematographer, William C. Thompson, and makeup man, Harry Thomas (unfortunately no one gets their face burned off with acid in this); former Columbia art director Jerome Pycha (Riders to the Stars, Unknown Island, Prehistoric Women), and future director (Cry Baby Killer, Twilight Zone, Lost in Space) Justus Addiss.

The year is 1970, the United States has a floating space platform, and the government is about to embark on exploration of the moon. The Russkies, who look and sound like Midwestern businessmen, find out, and decide to sabotage the operation by commandeering one of our spaceships and crashing it into the space station. To accomplish this, they infiltrate the mission with one of their 350 (!!) Exact Doubles of Prominent Scientists that they just happen to have lying around. After some talky explanations of gravitational principles by General ""Pappy"" Greene (Hayden Rorke, I Dream of Jeannie's Dr. Bellows), Major Bill Moore (Ross Ford), and Colonel Briteis (pronounced ""bright-eyes,"" cringe now) played by Donna Martell (Rocky Jones: Space Ranger) are selected, along with the doubled Dr. Wernher, for the mission to observe the dark side of the moon, much to their mutual consternation. See, Maj. Moore and Col. Briteis used to be an item . . . . During these set-up scenes it seems like you're in for one of those dry Gog type of flicks, but hang in there, things start to pick up once the space flight gets underway. For some reason they scream and sweat profusely on takeoff (?!), and they all wear easily the silliest uniforms ever seen, comprised of tee shirts, short shorts, big honking belt buckles, and demure felt aviators' caps, which look cute on Ms. Martell but laughable on everyone else. Once they arrive at the space station we get a docking-with-the-space-wheel sequence, crazily angled sets, some (intentionally?) hilarious scenes of crewmembers matter-of-factly walking on ceilings and sitting on walls, and ""please don't walk on the walls"" signs posted in the corridors. (These scenes are strangely prescient of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey; could this be one of the dozens of SF flicks he screened while preparing his masterpiece?). Bill, Col. Briteis, and the fake Dr. Wernher take off from the station on the observation mission, Bill suspects Dr. Wernher's true identity (he's unfamiliar with the Brooklyn Dodgers!), they're eventually forced to ditch their craft on the Moon, and Bill and Wernher go EVA to set up a communications relay. Throughout all this we get lots of nicely realized spaceship and moonscape sequences, conceptually on par or better than anything in a comparably-budgeted movie, forgiving a few laughably obvious gaffes. I also love how it appears that people on the ship's view screen seem to be simply sitting behind a hole in the wall, and late-night TV junkies will fondly nostalgia-trip on the B&W ""target"" test pattern they occasionally display. It all climaxes (spoiler alert) with an incredible only-in-the-50s ""family values"" denouement wherein the downed craft is proclaimed Moonbase #1; the now-clinching Bill and Briteis are ""ordered"" to get married by Dr. Bellows, er, General Greene since they'll be cohabiting on the Moon until a rescue mission can be mounted; the president of the United States turns out to be a woman (!!); and Maj. Moore jumps Col. Briteis just as the closing titles fill the screen. While not as patently ludicrous as Cat Women, Fire Maidens, or Queen of Outer Space, Project Moonbase is similarly bent in its own unique way, and easily as entertaining (the 63 minutes fly by). Fans of cheap B&W 50s space epics cannot fail to be entertained. Highly recommended.

This is another in Image's generally outstanding Wade Williams Collection and doesn't fail to impress. For a movie of its poverty-stricken pedigree the print is spectacular, with excellent black level, contrast, and brightness; rich gray values and crisp shadow/highlight detail; and virtually no damage save some very light speckling and spotting. As near to pristine (as claimed on the case) as could possibly be expected. The only extras are 12 chapter stops and a lightly speckled and lined but otherwise very nice looking trailer. A bare-bones yet essential addition to the DVD library of any 1950s SF aficionado.",1022976000,101,5540,5.1750278706800446
