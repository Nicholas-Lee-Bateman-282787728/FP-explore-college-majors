8411759,5,B00403190I,"I like it! It brings something new and creative. The action is moving fast.
I had a lot of fun watching inspector Coliandro in action.",1393977600,2,134,4.4
8411760,5,B00403190I,This series is an amazing romp into Italian Mysteries.  People will be drawn to the story lines and Inspector Coliandro's comedian ways of solving these crimes.,1378339200,,160,5.153846153846154
8411761,1,B00403190I,"If you like Inspector Soneri (Crime and Fog) or Inspector Montalbano or Inspector Brunetti, you probably will NOT like Inspector Coliandro.  Like the others, this series takes place in Italy, but it is inferior in all other respects.",1375142400,3,233,5.131578947368421
8411762,2,B00403190I,I diid not care for any of the episodes in this collection. The MHZ PBS broadcasts II saw were the same.,1369872000,,104,4.0
8411763,5,B00403190I,"Plots of intrigue, mystery and mayhem with an inept police detective in the mix...the episodes are all enjoyable and give us a look into the lives in this culture!",1366243200,,163,4.655172413793103
8411764,2,B00403190I,Same old shoot 'em and blow 'em up claptrap that pollutes our movie and TV screens from dawn to sunset.,1360972800,,103,4.2
8411765,4,B00403190I,"I find the series very entertaining even though it's loaded with profanity.  The acting is good and the plots are engaging.  I would like to be able to turn off the subtitles and listen to the Italian without English but that's not possible.  Also, you can't choose scenes and must complete the show on one device or start from the beginning.  If you like all types of detective shows, you'll like this one.  Try it!",1359072000,,416,4.493333333333333
8411766,5,B00403190I,"Coliandro is great. There is a bad review on here, but it is really off the mark. Coliandro should be compared against U.S. television shows, as that's what it is in Italy. And it is SO much better than most of the predictable stuff out there.

Basically, this guy thinks he's all that, when he isn't. He still gets the occasional girl, and foils the occasional crime, but even when he succeeds, he's still an idiot. But a lovable idiot.

Is every scene perfect? No. Is every single plot point logical. No. But most are. And the stories are interesting and more than just one level deep.

I've watched 5 or so episodes, and there wasn't one that didn't make me laugh at least a few times. Don't buy this series thinking your going to get Oscar caliber performances (although the lead actor is really damn good). But what you will get is some easy going, fun to watch television. I know I really like it. Coliandro!",1327017600,9,914,4.461077844311378
8411767,1,B00403190I,"...the worst production I can recall in many years. The plot is stupid and dull. There are NO sympathetic characters at any level. The acting is over the top and
at the Junior High School level. The direction is done with a baseball bat rather than a baton. Writing is about as amature as anything I can recall.
All in all, Inspector Coliandro is a monumental stinker, worthy of negative star rating.
The only decent thing is the font used for the sub-titles.
Detective Montalbano this aint.

December/6/2011
In fairness (a major personal failing of mine) I felt that my harsh review of this project may have been
over the top and possibly I missed something that would rescue the film from the cherem where it
was dispatched.
I dug it out of the trash barrel and replayed it again. giving it a chance.
NO. I was correct the first time.
It totally sucks. No saving grace. Nada. Effes.",1322784000,5,884,4.559748427672956
8411768,5,B00403190I,"The three other reviews are for ""Wallander"".  This one is for episodes 1-4 of ""Inspector Coliandro"", in Italian with English subtitles:

1.  Day of the Wolf:  A ""pony express"" delivery girl tries to deliver an envelope full of cash to the rightful Mafioso owner (she fell off her scooter and the envelope got damaged, so she knows what is inside).  She is extremely honest, and so is Coliandro.

2.  Into a Trap:  Coliandro's partner, Trombetti, is framed (killing an unarmed gangster).  But he did not do it; Coliandro proves it.

3.  Chinese Revenge:  A Chinese boy (8-10 years old) runs away... but from what?
You get to meet Coliandro's niece, ""the monster"".

4.  Black Magic:  that is the one I will watch tonight. A girl is killed for wanting to quit the prostitution racket.

Coliandro reminds me of Inspector Clouzeau: just as vain, but nos as stupid.

Five stars as far as I am concerned.  Now I will order episodes 5-8.",1307404800,11,929,4.6645962732919255
