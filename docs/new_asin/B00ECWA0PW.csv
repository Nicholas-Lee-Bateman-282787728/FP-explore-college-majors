5903854,5,B00ECWA0PW,As Always Shirley made another great movie. This movie is somewhere made during the 1960's. It has a very good meaning to the story. It's really deep. It's NOT JUST a Comedy.

5903858,5,B00ECWA0PW,"I saw this movie way back then in 1970. I always remembered it and wanted to see it again just to compare if I like it as I did the first time I watched it. I am not disappointed. I liked it a lot. Shirley Maclaine as Geisha was great and looked like one.
Of course this movie probably would not appeal to the young generation too much changed but for me it is great to see when relations between people were different and marriage was not just based on what I can get from you but also on what I can give up for my partner to make the marriage work.
In other words what's more important ""ME"" or ""US"".",1397001600,4,601,3.975206611570248

5903864,5,B00ECWA0PW,"I had an old VHS copy of this movie and watched it again to be sure that I wanted to replace it with a more durable DVD.  And I did.  I have been a Shirley MacLaine fan for many years and in this movie she plays everything from comedy to tragedy, excelling at both.  Her director/husband played by Yves Montand does not take her seriously in the tragic role of Madame Butterfly and dismisses her wish to expand her acting horizons to a serious role.  She is very determined and I will leave it at that so as not to spoil the surprise.",1425513600,4,534,4.155339805825243
5903865,5,B00ECWA0PW,"A favorite of mine for decades.  ***MILD SPOILERS***  This film was a thinly veiled take on Lucille Ball's and Desi Arnez's marriage.  Clever, red-headed comedienne Shirley Maclaine (Lucy Dell!) is married to French director Yves Montand (Paul Robaix), perceived to be riding on his wife's coat tails.  The film is about the machinations involved in Montand trying to gain recognition in his own right- but, unbeknowest to him, his wife has a hand in everything.  (In truth, Desi Arnez was the real genius behind the scenes and the one who literally engineered his WIFE'S career, but that wasn't widely known at the time.)

Another interesting wrinkle is that the movie was produced by Steve Parker, MacLaine's real-life husband (of nearly 30 years), who worked and lived in Japan with the couple's daughter, so while filming there MacLaine could stay with her family in their home (orchestrated by the couple so they could spend time together).

Though the movie is outdated in that men's careers are assumed to be of far greater importance than women's (1962!), I don't care, I love it.  I'm a big fan of both Shirley MacLaine and Yves Montand (could listen to Montand read the phone book), and  the chemistry between them is potent, everyone's acting is top-notch.  MacLaine over-acts shamelessly as Madame Butterfly, in the ""film within a film"" (over the top, love it), but as both American movie star and modern geisha, she's superb.  This is Shirley's show all the way, she gives a tour de force performance.  Edward G. Robinson lends craggy charm and quiet dignity to the proceedings, Robert Cummings is at his skirt-chasing (albeit over-the-hill) best, and lovely Yko Tani is perfect as wise Kazumi.

Alternately funny and touching, this is a romantic, sexy comedy of the highest calibre, at its heart the story of a  love between two driven, imperfect people.  The film has more character development than the average rom-com (and puts others of the era, like Doris Day or Dean Martin movies, to shame).  It has an impressive pedigree: written by Norman Krasna, who wrote the screenplays to several other of my favorite films, e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-and-Miss-Jones/dp/B00B27WTBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil and Miss Jones</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Christmas/dp/B000IBUOX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Christmas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bachelor-Mother/dp/6301564480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bachelor Mother</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-O-Rourke/dp/B002KE4ZIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess O'Rourke</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Started-with-Eve/dp/B00CBD8S8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Started with Eve</a>.

It was directed by Jack Cardiff, not only a great director (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-and-Lovers/dp/B00GNLY0CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons and Lovers</a>), but one of the best cinematographers of all time (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen/dp/B003F3KKCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Shoes/dp/B009B6I0SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Shoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Narcissus/dp/B00D0K025K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Narcissus</a>, many more)- and the colors, clothing, costumes (Edith Head won an Oscar for costume design), locations (e.g., Mount Fuji) and settings are all GORGEOUS, eye candy, the Eames era on steroids, plus Japan in the early 60s.  Much of the comedy results from the clash of cultures- Hollywood meets traditional Japanese values.  The ending is dramatic, hokey and WONDERFUL.  Highly recommended!

P.S. Another favorite Shirley MacLaine film from two years earlier, directed by the great Billy Wilder, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apartment/dp/B004AUHWLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apartment</a>.",1423440000,6,4280,7.435643564356436

8603996,5,B00ECWA0PW,"Paul Robaix (Yves Montand) is a top notch movie maker. The only problem is that every one attributes his success to his actress wife (Shirley MacLaine.) To prove himself, he sets out for Japan to do a remake of 'Madame Butterfly', with out his wife's participation.

Unknown to him, the studio, represented by Edward G Robinson, has condemned him to a black and white film. His wife has cooked up a scheme to extricate her husband from the situation.

Will this plan save face or become the downfall of their career and marriage?",1500854400,,529,4.67741935483871
