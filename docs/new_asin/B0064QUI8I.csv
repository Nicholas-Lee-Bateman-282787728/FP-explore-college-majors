8492797,5,B0064QUI8I,"Hard to believe but Wozzeck was only the 5th opera album I ever purchased.  All I had known was Fidelio, Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Carmen.  I'd not heard any Verdi, Wagner, or Puccini, but for some reason that escapes me, I determined my next opera would be Wozzeck.  It was the Fischer-Dieskau version with Bohm.  So I have been in awe of both the opera and that recording for decades, but at the same time never felt inclined to acquire another Wozzeck simply because I felt the Bohm rendition was perfect and none other would ever measure up.

So it was with a little fear and trepidation that I picked up this video version--fear of wasting money, fear of being disappointed with lousy singing, lousy acting, lousy costumes, lousy German pronunciation, even fear of a lousy overblown production as the Met sometimes does.

Well, I am happy to report it meets and wildly exceeds everything I was hoping for.  And I wasn't even hoping for excellent picture and sound, but it is as good or better as anything I have ever heard come out of a Met DVD.  Another thing I really liked was seeing the orchestra, conductor Levine, and instrumental closeups during each of the orchestral interludes between scenes.  One does not normally see that in a Met DVD.

In short it is highly recommended, beyond what I thought the Met could or would do with this material.  Yes, it is as creepy as what the old Bohm LP set created with 'scenery of the mind', and it is as equally idiomatic as Bohm's, even recalling (I believe) that he knew and worked with the composer.  Again, most highly recommended.",1392595200,6,1600,4.614840989399293
8492798,4,B0064QUI8I,"With ""Wozzeck,"" we come to one of history's most powerful operas. Falk Struckmann, Katrina Dalayman, Wolfgang Neumann, Graham Clark, and Michael Devlin lead the cast of this 2001 performance, in the staging of Mark Lamos. (This writer saw this production in the theatre, in 1997.)

Lamos' production is spare and simple, a legitimate way to deal with this work, considering the ferocity and complexity of the music. The appropriately expressionistic lighting (by James F. Ingalls) is very especially effective. James Levine is here at his absolute finest, showing his power and mastery in a difficult score.

Struckmann is excellent in the Everyman of the title, with an attractive, dark sound. Dalayman has (rather unusual for the Expressionistic operas) a healthy-sounding voice, and captures the impoverished, ordinary, sympathetic woman who is Marie.

Neumann is marvelous as the Drum Major. With a controversial voice, to be certain, he delivers an unstinting and memorable portrait of this unpleasant character. Clark actually sings the role of the Captain, a role in which tenors are usually content to simply scream.

Devlin is chillingly masterful (and resembling Nosferatu) as the Doctor. A credit to his long-ago mentor, the great Norman Treigle (who contemplated, but never undertook, the title role of this opera), his plasticity of gesture is a lesson in great operatic acting.

Elsewhere in this fine cast, John Horton Murray is a remarkable Andres, and Anthony Laciura had one of his finest roles as the deranged Fool.

It must be regretted that earlier casts in the Metropolitan's performance history of ""Wozzeck"" were not filmed. Anja Silja's Marie (1980, now released on Compact Discs) was epochal, and Christian Boesch's Wozzeck (1985) was heartbreaking. This writer has heard this opera many times, and they were the most memorable portrayals of these parts in his experience.",1325376000,18,1897,5.348993288590604
