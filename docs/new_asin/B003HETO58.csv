4125574,5,B003HETO58,"I am very pleased with this product! Originally I was hesitant to purchase a DVD offering 7 smoothie for $15 bucks but now I am super glad I did!
In this video, Valya Boutenko demonstrate how simple it is to create delicious / nutritious green smoothies that are sure to please the taste buds of people young and old. I thought I knew everything there was to know about green smoothie until I watched this dvd. At least 5 of the 7 recipes were a completely new concept to me. Before watching this movie it never occurred that I could make tasty green puddings with coconut or make savory green smoothie.

In addition to awesome smoothie ideas, Boutenko also presents many helpful tips and tricks throughout the whole dvd that have helped me streamline the amount of time I spend in the kitchen making food!

Bottom line:

This DVD is well worth the money! And at $2 per smoothie, it's still cheaper than a cup of coffee!",1286409600,10,920,4.497005988023952
4125575,5,B003HETO58,"In this humbly named dvd, the experienced chef Valya intersperses her seven recipe demonstrations with encyclopediac outpourings on the various healing properties of fresh foods. Her ongoing instructions give you solid principles for how to make any smoothie taste good. Her ideas for skin care and suggested variations describe more possible recipes. You'll even learn how to open a coconut, a very valuable skill. Valya answers several questions live and it looks like the participants had fun. Like inviting the Boutenkos to your own home, in an absolutely professional and beautiful presentation that keeps the viewer engaged.",1285027200,7,630,5.505154639175258

8397052,3,B003HETO58,"The content is very informative but there is one item that requires a warning. She claims in the ""Green smoothies for pets"" that for a dog you can put grapes in the smoothies if you do your pet will die. GRAPES IN ANY FORM INCLUDING RAISENS ARE TOXIC AND LETHAL FOR DOGS, THEY EVENTUALLY WILL END UP WITH ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Unfortunately this happened to us and to a friend of ours.

8397055,5,B003HETO58,"My family really enjoyed this dvd.  Answered lots of questions about making smoothies.  Like why  ours sometimes turn out watery and frothy. And, why it could be bitter.

More enjoyable to watch than if we were reading about it. I even tried some new fruits and ""weed greens"". With this new information we may just try making savory smoothies again, despite my not so great concoctions before.

Don't let the small amount of recipies discourage you. I found the techniques and info on the recipies to be excellent, and more importantly it will help you make your own recipies better.",1345161600,5,583,4.79
8397056,5,B003HETO58,"I am not a newby to green smoothies, but I found that I learned lots of helpful information in what parts of the fruits and vegetable can be safely added to your drink by viewing this dvd.  In fact, I watched it twice!  For anyone new to making nutritional smoothies, this is a must see.  To Your Health!",1322784000,,304,4.206896551724138
8397057,5,B003HETO58,"Even though I have been making Green Smoothies for over a year and have read all of the Raw Family's books on them, I found new insight through this wonderful demonstration. As one person who never even bought the video negatively commented, it is not only about 7 recipes but instead full off tips on how to combine flavors, what to look for in ingredients, and new ways to think about smoothies.

I thoroughly enjoyed Valya and her laid back approach to smoothie making. It was all her off the cuff comments that I found so useful. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to get into green smoothies or anyone wanting a fresh perspective on how and why to try certain new combinations.

Worth the money!",1288828800,14,708,4.566929133858268
8397058,5,B003HETO58,"Although I've been making and drinking green smoothies for years, I learned a lot from Valya's informative, engaging and professional presentation. Your expectations will be far exceeded if you are expecting just a demonstration of 7 green smoothies in the classic style - this video provides so much more! A green smoothie can be a savory soup, a sweet yummy pudding - even one to apply to your skin! Valya shares lots of tips for making your smoothies super-tasty, as well as nutritious. I heartily recommend this video to those looking for a basic guide to preparing (and garnishing!) green smoothies, and also to those who are seeking a fresh perspective and more in-depth information. Delightful!",1286668800,8,701,5.051724137931035
