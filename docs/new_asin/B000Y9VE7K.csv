8231370,5,B000Y9VE7K,"Strangely there are two slightly different versions of this mini set #2.
The original release with the same artwork but ""Astro Boy"" written in jagged lettering has episodes 27 through 52.
This re-issue has episodes 26 through 52.

So if your Mini Set #1 has only episodes 1 through 25, then you need to make sure you buy this re-issue set to get episode 26.

Your guess is as good as mine as to why episode 26 moved from set 1 to set 2.

My 5-star rating is for the excellent quality & entertainment value of the show!",1424131200,5,518,4.26530612244898
8231371,5,B000Y9VE7K,"This second volume of Astro Boy is even more cosmic then the first! In THE MYSTERIOUS COSMIC RAYS Astro Boy has to deal with a man who stays young by feeding off the life force of others but he loses control and turns into a monster after he has lived on Mars! In MOON MONSTERS Astro boy encountered monsters that terrorise a moon colony and defeated them!

In ELIXER OF LIFE a scientist has discovered a youth formula so mankind can live forever! But a cult wants him to give them the formula and Astro Boy must win the trust of the scientist! In ASTRO BOY GOES TO SCHOOL Astro went to school and after being punished by the principal, rescues the school teacher who is a robot, from being reprogrammed for a different use by a madman! THE MYSTERIOUS CAT has a cat that along with his owner tried to stop the land owners from attacking the animals who lived there and Astro had to come to their aid!

And in CLEOPATRA'S HEART and THE RETURN OF CLEOPATRA a robot Cleopatra has been made by the evil Rasputin to convince the people of Egypt that they must do as she says or face her wrath! Astro Boy defeated her and her giant robots and Rasputin loses in the end! All of this takes place in the 21st century and it is interesting to see how a 1960's show holds up in 2015! It just goes to show that a limeted animation show does NOT necessarely mean a limeted imagenation!

Astro Boy continued its Max Fliesher aproch to it's animation and remains freash and appealing today! I hope more copies of this series from RIGHT STUFF will be available since the $16.00 price for each of two volumes is a real bargain!",1421020800,,1610,4.324503311258278
