6031721,5,B00FV91IK6,"How was this cancelled? It had all the aspects of what I'd expect to be a fairly popular show.
Sure, it's not for everyone, I suppose, but no show is.

I've been waiting for Merchant to do a show like this, that he's at the center of, separate from Gervais, and this was the answer to my prayers. If you've watched his Hello Ladies tour DVD, you'll notice a bit of the ideas mentioned during his stand-up are incorporated into the show (like the annoying child and loquacious woman at the wedding).

I loved watching the deluded Stuart attempt to romance ladies that, for the most part, just weren't 'into' him. Sometimes it was cringe-worthy and sometimes his character was 'mean', but, by god, it was enjoyable! I was watching it on the subway, and often found myself unable to suppress my laughter. (Some of the comedic moments were so unexpected!)

There was so much more that could've been done!

It was cancelled too soon, I think. Far too soon. If the ratings weren't good enough, I bet they would've improved by Season Two. I have no clue how they're going to wrap it up in one special..
I'll be sorry to see this show go.",1392508800,60,1130,4.470873786407767
6031722,5,B00FV91IK6,"Not your common sitcom. This one is more subtle and sometimes can even be a little disturbing. The kind of took the 'loser' thing to the extreme here and because the show is so realistic, you may find yourself thinking (or even saying out loud) ""how can he be so stupid!"" but to me that's really part of this show's appeal. You can kind of trust Stuart to always do the wrong thing but you never know exactly HOW he is going to mess things up.

The last 2 episodes are somewhat more optimistic but not entirely. Sort of a reflection of what this show is: a mix of comedy and drama. Funny, but also sad in a way. I liked how the first season ended (but to avoid any spoilers I will stop at that).

I really hope this show comes back on HBO next season. It's just so well made - there aren't a lot of like it on TV.",1392076800,3,813,4.012345679012346
6031723,5,B00FV91IK6,"Stephen Merchant is so funny and a bit painful to watch.  I'm rooting for his character, Stuart, more and more.  Everyone in the cast is quite good and I love the great vintage music accompanying each episode.  Some great choices there.  I will be so disappointed if it doesn't return.  It certainly deserves to but you never know.",1391904000,3,331,4.637931034482759
6031724,4,B00FV91IK6,hello ladies is amazing show but at parts is so awkward and so painful to watch the character played by Stephen Merchant who a great British comedian and it's so hard to watch the while he goes thru stuff in this show. He is so a true nice guy but he trying so hard to find a supermodel Type female but he has a multitude of opportunities with very attractive normal women but he doesn't even recognize it because of the hype or L.A. and glorified anorexia types and it never works out because you know he doesn't have the heart to do what is necessary but still overall a great show and if you get a chance check it out it's on HBO. I don't know what to categorize the show as but I like it and recommend that you check it out.,1388448000,,728,4.0625
6031725,5,B00FV91IK6,"Love Stephen Merchant.  Loved him on Extras and was waiting for someone to give him his own show. Of course, it would have to be HBO.  Nobody else out there seems to recognize new talent!!!  This is a funny show.  I tuned in because of Stephen, but all of the characters are really excellent.  Thank you so much HBO for giving him a chance. Can't wait for ""Season 2""!!  Also hope HBO will do something with Taylor Williamson!  He'd be great in a sit com or a couple of stand up specials!",1384300800,17,487,4.228260869565218

6031754,5,B00FV91IK6,Admittedly the first time I watched this series I couldn't get much into it. About half way into the season you really start to understand/appreciate the characters and what this show is really about. By the end I was really hoping to find season two.

6031761,1,B00FV91IK6,"I made it part way through episode 4 and then I had to stop; it was becoming too painful to watch. The lead isn't awkward or bumbling in an endearing way; he seems to totally lack self-awareness. of situational awareness, and of any sort of empathy for the feelings of those around him. The individual as portrayed needs some serious therapy before he should be allowed to interact with normal people.
He has a laser focus on scoring with beautiful women and exhibits no interests in developing an actual connection with a real person. In the third episode he actually has an encounter that might lead to an actual relationship, but he of course totally ruins his chance by offending his date as a result of his asinine behavior.
STOP NOW to avoid the SPOILER: In short, during episode 4 his misinterpretation of texting by his date to ""Alex"" during a date unhinges him and causes him to creep out and offend his date. Alex was her sick brother. So apparently he was able to spend the good part of an evening with this woman without learning anything about her, such as whether she had siblings. Probably makes sense, since his main focus would be waiting tor it to be time to bang her.",1505952000,,1186,4.546728971962617

I too, like a lot of other reviewers on here, wanted to like this show for some reason.  I went into it thinking that the talent involved had a decent track record, but I made it about ten minutes into the first episode and shut it off.

A few days later I looked at some reviews - most of which were really positive so I figured I'd give it another shot.  Made it through the first episode and was really surprised with the negative taste I'd gotten from it.  I figured hey, it must be me, cause people on here seem to like it.  IMDB has it at 7.5.  Rotten tomatoes had it ad a 52 for critics and an 85 for audience members so I was like, ok, I'll bang out a few more episodes, but it just never got better.  If anything it got more negative in tone, more mean spirited and more depressing overall.

Maybe it's me.  Maybe I went into this thinking it'd have more of a comedic vibe like some of his earlier work but it was just dark.  The characters are vile towards each other, un-empathetic, condescending, self absorbed and just plain rude.  I can't imagine ever interacting with anyone again in my life if they'd treated me anywhere near the way the characters in this series treated each other and yet they continued on.

And so did I.  I wish I'd broken it off at this point but I was already several episodes in, and I'm the type who, if I open a book or start a movie, I have to finish it.  So I did.  I watched every episode, all the while hoping that something would shift and it'd get better but it never did.

Had to be me right?  75-85% of people across the internet seem to like this show.  Maybe this is what's acceptable for funny nowadays.  Maybe it was supposed to be a dark depressing drama all along.  I don't know.  Bottom line is I wanted to like it but just really did not.

Or maybe it's not me.",1470700800,7,1835,4.135977337110481

I frequently found myself pausing because I'd lost my composure laughing so hard. Merchant is one of my favorite comedic actors, and his character is loveably self-absorbed. This isn't the kind of show where you'd expect to be drawn into a budding romance, so it's a pleasant surprise when you are as a viewer.

6032071,5,B00FV91IK6,"A wonderfully detailed and accurate script, great acting, but incredibly depressing.  I find each episode to be sad in the way that Stewart continually gets in his own way. His narcissism dictates that the only person he sees is himself.  His only concern on a date, party, life is that he be the center of attention and be generous to only himself. He is beyond a truly selfless gesture or generous gift at all, much less without expecting something he believes he deserves in return. Because of his self-centeredness he doesn't anticipate or understand the reactions of those around him.  He genuinely expects others to love him and be generous in a way he isn't and can't be. So he barrels straight ahead expecting to achieve his highest wish of going to his school reunion with a model to make a girl  regret not being the great catch that he thinks  is. While a common reunion fantasy, even if he achieved it, he would be stuck with a girl he had nothing in common with (because all he required was a model... no other attributes) assuming that he was a great catch.  He still wouldn't have the high school love, lost money, time and opportunity to find a true love. And without introspection or valuing any opinion other than his own, he will never understand how he created his own lonely end .  Entertaining in a way that it would have been nice to see if it got funny in a second season. I love Steven Merchant's work, depressing or not.",1450483200,,1446,4.517241379310345
6032072,4,B00FV91IK6,"Peter Crouch is brilliant as the ""he thinks he's smooth but he's more likely to say something inapproriate"" man on the make in El Lay. Some of the lines just totally cracked me up. The other thing is this series has a lot of heart. You know Stoke City and England forward Crouch has a fondness for his coworker, his two best buds (weeping ex-married guy and wheelchair-bound true ladies man) as well as his houseguest (actress woman).

The club scenes are a total blast. Crouch's clumsy attempts to score a model as a girlfriend are the best.

The last disc is a full movie where everything gets wrapped up and, no, I'm not giving this away, Peter Crouch finally gets the girl and stays in LA to play for the Galaxy.

Extras are just deleted scenes and a fairly short look at the series with actor interviews.

Oh, hold on, I'm being informed that the 6"" 7"" actor was not in fact Peter Crouch but some fellow called Stephen Merchant.",1450310400,4,933,4.43859649122807

6032132,2,B00FV91IK6,Not as good as I would expect from Steven Mergent sp and especially HBO. This show though clever is painful to watch and embarrassing to feel. I've seen Steven's past work and found him to be honest clever witty and entertaining however I will follow this character to it's 1st seasons end regardless The other characters are honest and though somewhat posh real. Steven's character is just painfully silly and appears that someone is making humor from an inept human being. Enough said.,1445558400,2,487,4.879518072289157

6032158,1,B00FV91IK6,"Merchant plays a grinning would-be lothario whose overtures are too nerdy/coarse/clueless to interest anyone, yet he tirelessly, obliviously persists. It sticks very closely to the now-familiar bantering, cringe-inducing comedy style of other Merchant and Ricky Gervais vehicles, such as The Office and Extras and others, and, per that formula, has the same underlying tone of loneliness and desperation. I think the intention is that we should see through Merchant's surface odiousness to the basically sweet fellow there--and root for his probably eventual romance with his beautiful tenant--but I didn't find him or his situation interesting enough to care about.",1444176000,2,666,5.737373737373737

He's obnoxious and invasive, and doesn't see how annoying his pick-ups are BUT seeing how low he'll go to get a date is nearly intolerable. I guess it's because there really are men out there who are just as pathetic and blind to their own mistakes. This is why it is so depressing - art imitating life in the saddest way.

I laugh at some of the scenes while watching, but turning it off find myself really down. Odd how a comedy would do that.

Not one of them resonated with me, which is unusual for me. I am quite empathetic. I am the type to get drawn into shows and feel the pain of the characters.

There's really only two ways the show can go:

1) The main character (Stephen Merchant) finds love.
2) He remains a schmuck.

The show was so lacking in engagement, and I am so completely and totally indifferent to all the characters that I don't care to find out.

The only reason this show gets 2 stars is because the production values are outstanding.",1432857600,4,667,4.442622950819672

The star of the show is so damn funny.  When I saw him on the Today show and he announced that HBO was ending the show my heart sunk.  He looked really sad about the news too.  He seems like a cool down to earth guy in real life.  I think the character he portrays resonates well with the audience because you see a lot of yourself and or have a friend that reminds you of this guy.  Solid, funny show and I feel like I just missed it the first time around.  Now that I love it, it gets cancelled.  Awww, life.

Srewart is an English geek with coke bottle glasses, thin and tall. His mother must have told him every day he was God's gift to the world; and he believed it. He has a desire to date only beautiful models and actresses (in LA).  To that end he plans his schemes to meet and party with them. All this while overlooking, and just being friends with his tenant, a wanna be actress with her own esteem issues. It has many funny moments and the soundt track works beautifully with the series. I won't spoil it for you; but the more you watch, the more you look forward to the next episode. So I was sad to learn the show will not be renewed for a second season. Someone said it would have done better in the UK, as it is more British humor. I love all the British shows and comedies so maybe why I loved it more.",1426636800,3,935,4.137362637362638

6032694,4,B00FV91IK6,"If you like the cringe-worthy antics of Ricky Gervais, you will certainly enjoy Steven Merchant in ""Hello Ladies"".  While not so much a giggling buffoon as Gervais's David Brent from the BBC's ""The Office"", Merchant's Stuart Pritchard is a close second in terms of an outlandish self-image.  Stuart's unwavering belief that he could easily date the models and actresses of Los Angeles leads to endless uncomfortable silences and embarrassing situations.  Christine Woods (most recently seen in season 5 of ""The Walking Dead"") is excellent as Jessica, an unemployed actress and Stuart's tenant and friend.  Her winning combination of annoyance and affection for Stuart is realistic and heartwarming.  Nate Torrence is Stuart's lovable, innocent, and recently-separated best friend Wade.  Wade is a human golden retriever: big, dopey, and just loves Stuart no matter how much of an arse he is.  A bright spot is Rory (Kyle Mooney), Stuart's nerdy assistant who wants nothing more than to be cool in Stuart's eyes but fails every time.  Secondary story lines land both Woods and Torrence in horribly awkward situations that rival Stuart's in the Ugh Factor.  Just like much of Merchant's previous collaborations with Gervais, ""Hello Ladies"" does not disappoint in the heartwarming-ending department.  Stuart leaves us with just a glimmer of hope that there is some depth and intelligence in that gawky 6-foot 7-inch frame.",1419897600,,1419,5.322869955156951

Now that the show is finished, I wonder if we will finally get a release of the eight-episode series? Better yet, how about a complete set with all eight episodes and the movie that wrapped up the series. Even BETTER YET, a super complete set with all of that plus the original live show...?

I never even finished episode one.  Often, the pilot episode is not as good as later episodes.  But sometimes, a show just isn't worth the time.  In this case, I didn't care to waste my time to find out.

Nothing about this was subtle or particularly clever.  ""Relationship"" humor has been done to death.  Therefore, it has to be at least a bit better than all the other garbage out there for me to spend my time.  This was just awkward and stretching.  I didn't think anything about it really captured the actual humor that comes with dating.  Maybe I just live in a different world.

Inbetweeners, Superbad, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Peep Show, they all have that same type of ""comedy"" that just isn't funny to me at all.

6033088,4,B00FV91IK6,"I'm surprised HBO cancelled this show so quickly .... but I can understand why ""Hello Ladies"" wasn't quite the home run we might have expected.

First let me say I like the show overall, (but I do have some reservations which I'll soon explain),  I've always enjoyed Stephen Merchant's cringe-inducing humor and he doles it out in massive quantities here.  I also like the supporting cast, although I felt some of the characters were under-developed.  (Christine Woods as Jessica was the standout; she could carry her own show, imo).  But that trademark acerbic Brit sense of humor ... that might be one of the problems audiences had with embracing the show.

My feeling is that Merchant and his show would have worked better on the BBC.  There's something about the dark cringe humor that didn't seem to work so well when transported to sunny LA.  It's as though there's a collision between US and Brit humor; the one doesn't always complement the other.  At times it seemed as if Merchant was acting in one show and his US castmates were acting in another.  That's my take, anyway

Speaking of Merchant, he might have been a drawback to the show as well.  While he's gifted behind the scenes, I wouldn't necessarily build a show around him (he, as the series creator, obviously had a different opinion, lol).  I found him somewhat  cold, almost reptilian in a way.  While he played the awkward situations well, I couldn't warm up to him.  I think Merchant is better suited to supporting roles, where his aloof, eccentric onscreen persona can be absorbed in smaller doses.  (In a similar vein, ""Seinfeld's"" Kramer was a classic supporting character -- but would you build a series around him?)

Still, I think HBO should have shown more faith in the show.  Some of the issues I've mentioned could have been worked out during Season 2.  Personally, I'd love to see the BBC pick up the show (kind of surprised it didn't appear on the Beeb to begin with) and transport Stuart to England.  But I doubt that'll ever happen.

While some of my comments may have come off as overly critical, I do in fact think ""Hello Ladies"" will make you laugh and is more than worth your time.",1406937600,24,2172,4.660526315789474

I like cultural content so I think that helped me get through four repetitive and confusing shows.  I completely could not get what was funny about what was happening except for one gross social faux pas after another (after another) and so on.  Not like in a funny way.  (Try Fawlty Towers for HILARIOUS versions of that)  Maybe I'm an old person in a young person's body, but I'm not sure how this is even an actual HBO show.

However, if you liked the pilot, this might be for you.",1404864000,7,976,4.342541436464089

Some shows thrive on making the viewers cringe from the awkward situations putting either likeable main characters (Michael Scott - The Office) or by having a sleazy secondary character (George Castanza - Seinfeld) that gets into those situations.  This show goes a different route, choosing instead to give us an unlikable, sleazy, main character who stumbles from awkward scene to awkward scene, doing nothing to redeem the character.",1404777600,17,548,5.0777777777777775

6033179,3,B00FV91IK6,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Stephen Merchant. He absolutely nails this role, and the rest of the cast is similarly outstanding. This show is actually quite depressing. It is punctuated by moments of true hilarity, but those moments are few and far between. The series grows progressively more bleak, and by the end of the series I felt like I had undergone some type of dental surgery. I couldn't bear to watch back-to-back episodes. I found myself squirming and gritting my teeth--which, to be fair, is absolutely the show's intention. Imagine the worst, most awkward date you've ever been on. Looking back, you can laugh about it, but while you're experiencing it, it is agonizing. That being said, the characters, acting, writing, and production are excellent. If you enjoy Stephan Merchant or Ricky Gervais you should watch the series. I was just frustrated because it lands much more in the depressing/drama category than comedic. I was hoping for some sort of redemption at the end, but the final episode is simply a let down.",1404172800,,1054,4.893854748603352

I actually know people like this. It's hardly an exaggeration. Stephen Merchant is just a bit dorky and difficult to digest but  he's brilliant. The show is painful, hilarious and sweet at the same time and exposes the living hell that is modern day LA.
Sad they cancelled it. The critics has their knives out instantly. Interestingly the fans loved it. HBO bowed to the critics and yet they ran True Blood for years. What an embarrassing turd of a show. Critics loved it!",1404172800,,621,4.544642857142857

I can see why he oftentimes partners with Ricky Gervais because they both look at the world in an uncompromising, self-centered and arrogant way which often leaves me squirming and hoping to the heavens that I never have or will act that way.  The BIG difference between Gervais and Merchant though is that Gervais, every once in a while, reveals his character's weakness and insecurities which makes him someone I can relate to and, well..yes...likeable.  Merchant never lets his character, Stuart, deal with his vulnerabilities with anything but thoughtlessness and sometimes, meanness.  He blunders his way through life dishing out cruelty and rudeness.  There's not one single thing that his character does that  makes him someone I'd want to know.  I watched the first season and it was ok mainly because of the supporting characters especially the adorable Wade (played by Nate Torrance), who is a loyal and giving friend to Stuart no matter how many times Stuart disappoints him.  I'm not surprised that the show has been cancelled.  But I have faith that Merchant will create something better and, hopefully, with more likeability.  He is a talented guy who will eventually find his way.",1403481600,8,1221,5.090452261306533

He tall and gangly and weird, yet somehow manages to get into situations where he has a shot with incredibly beautiful supermodels and things always go wrong for him.  It's funny, but very predictable and often had to watch, as you know he's going to tank.

Because the writing is based on British humor and how failure can be criticized and be funny, I think most viewers will not enjoy this show or get it. HBO was right to cancel and I assume the next series they proposed would still have the primary characters failing with the dry humor. I like British writing but this series seems to have been destroyed possibly by a senior producer thinking it would be better to put an American-type delivery. So, I recommend to not watch these 8 episodes and hope Mr. Merchant and Christine Woods (BTW, a very talented and pretty lady) keep working as I enjoy both of them as entertainers.",1402099200,,720,4.462121212121212

Now the tables are turned and he's a totally clueless Brit called Stuart living in LA making a living as a Website designer (although I don't recall one customer interaction in 10 episodes)  stumbling through one vain quest after another in search of meaningless sex.  He's hilarious and a buffoon. Interestingly enough his suite  mate Jessica played by Christine Wood is gradually revealed to be just as pathetic as Stuart.

The structure is classic sitcom, not the usual edgy programming expected from HBO. It is a basic sitcom format with the usual characters, his relationship with his lodger is predictable and unbelievable. The writing is above and beyond most comedy currently on TV. His acting is not bad actor and the strong supporting cast definitely helps him out. Safe but well written and performed.

6033293,5,B00FV91IK6,"This show is really funny. I like the characters in this. Watched about 3 episodes. Plenty of super awkward scenes and plenty of scenes that will surprise and make you laugh uncontrollably. Unfortunately, think I see why this show ultimately was canceled, same reason I won't rewatch. Ultimately its too said. While Gervais was a jerk and always sticking his foot in his mouth in BBC office, at end of day, even when you began to feel a little sorry for him he would do something extra terrible and then you would laugh and not feel sorry for him in the least. In this show, you've got essentially a very likeable character that keeps getting the shaft. Hard to take after awhile. Maybe if they had some other subplot that was positive offsetting it like the Tim + whatever her name was :)

Some of the ideas presented in this show were first rate, and that was only in the couple episodes I saw. I liked the ""AG"" concept his friend comes up with which is hilarious. So if you can deal with the admittedly sad aspect of this guy continually screwing stuff up and going home pathetic, you will see in my opinion great comedy.",1400803200,2,1124,4.456310679611651
