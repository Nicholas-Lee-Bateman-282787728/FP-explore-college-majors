3960860,3,B002OCX6YO,"""The Secret of Moonacre"" is the filmed adaptation of the fantasy novel ""The Little White Horse"" written Elizabeth Goudge. Originally published in 1946, the book had been turned into a TV mini-series in 1994 as ""Moonacre."" This new feature film stars Dakota Blue Richards, known for her praised portrayal of Lyra Belacqua of ""The Golden Compass,"" as Maria Merryweather, a spirited heroine of the story. The film is directed by Gabor Csupo, director of ""Bridge to Terabithia"" (2007), but his new film is not just as emotionally involving as his previous effort.

Set in Victorian Britain, the story follows Maria Merryweather (Dakota Blue Richards), whose father suddenly passed away. Left penniless and orphaned, 13-year-old Maria moves to her uncle's Moonacre Manor with her nurse Miss Heliotrope (Juliet Stevenson). Maria's moody uncle Sir Benjamin Merryweather (Ioan Gruffudd), who strictly forbids Maria from going into the woods, seems to be hiding a secret or two about the estate and its legend. In this quiet valley Maria senses mysterious powers going on, as well as some danger coming.

Other characters include Coeur De Noir (Tim Curry), Robin De Noir (Augustus Prew), Loveday (Natascha McElhone) and a big black ""dog"" Wrolf. Long-lasting feuds and romances are also implied.

""The Secret of Moonacre"" should have been a great fantasy movie, with Dakota Blue Richards as the feisty, smart and independent heroine. Unfortunately, though her character remains likable and delectable, the film's underwritten script doesn't offer her chances to show what Maria really can do, or wants to do.

What is worse, Moonacre hardly looks mysterious; Special effects (especially that of The Little White Horse, original title of the film) needs improvement. Action scenes greatly suffer from the uneven pace and choppy editing. The filmmakers cannot settle on a consistent tone with silly jokes and weak romances.

At the time of writing this review, the sequel to ""The Golden Compass"" is not likely to materialize, so it is only natural that those who are impressed with Dakota Blue Richards like me would expect something refreshing or charming as her Lyla Belacqua here. Though Dakota Blue Richards again provides a strong performance as the young heroine, ""The Secret of Moonacre"" needs a bigger budget and a better screenplay.",1266796800,,2329,5.2668463611859835
3960861,3,B002OCX6YO,"There were so many pluses in this film. It was spectacularly filmed. The settings and houses used were perfect. Set in semi Wilderness there was a wild and untamed look to it, but it was also civilised enough to see that it was a place in decay. It is the valley of Moonacre which has been beset by a curse from the Moon Princess because of the greed of two families. If the families cannot get rid of the curse by the 500th rise of the full moon then the entire valley will be destroyed. ONly a true Moon Princess can break the curse. And that Moon Princess is played by Dakato Blue Richards.

Left an orphan by the untimely death of her father, she returns to Moonacre with only her governess and an old book as her legacy. Her father having gambled her wealth away. They are attacked on the way by ruffians but manage to escape ok but at the Mansion of Moonare are met by her mildly forbidding Uncle and his rather dark dog who is 'unlikely' to attack a Merryweather.

The house is a wonderful picture of mild decay. the creamy plastered walls are gorgeous, for all those of you who want to discover your inner shabby chic. And while the costumes are outlandish John-Paul Gaultier interpretations of bustled late Victorian fashion they are rather charming. In fact much of the forbidding aspect of Moonacre is removed by the strange but extraodinaruly bright costuming. Contrasting that with the workers in the field - they have plumped for Medieval wear - leather caps and black clothing.

The Merryweather's enemys are rivals in the valley the Denils (Sorry I can't remember the name!) are also in medieval style clothing, they dine in old style banqueting halls, and Tim Curry does a great evil turn as the head of that household. The boys of this household form a strange little ruffian gang which has been costumed straight out of a Clockwork Orange - complete with eye makeup and bowler hats. Rather disconcerting.

As the true blue Moon Princess only she can see where the Moon Pearls have been concealed and prevent the curse from destroying the valley, but she has only until the very next moonrise to do it.

It is not entirely clear why she is motivated to do things in the movie, although it is clear in the book. And some of the editing, and story motivations are lacking. Why should she need to sneak into the Denil's fortress to present them with the key? Why does the older moon princess suddenly decide that they should split up when searching for her? Why does no one notice the governess is missing before presenting her at the end of the book.

There seems to be a big production of the Moon Princess in Bare feet, but this isn't really explained. And why does the Moon Princess have to jump into the sea, and why is she saved?

The movie looks great, and my littlest one who couldn't sit through Ice Age 3 or Up without demanding to be taken out because she was too scared - sat through this movie like a lamb. She was enthralled by it. The scary bits weren't that scary, and the colour and action was clearly engaging.

However for older watchers I think the flaws in the movie will be too great to be glossed over by Ioan Gruffud's incredible screen Charisma.",1254960000,7,3185,4.488773747841106

3960869,2,B002OCX6YO,"2.5 stars.  A solid meh.  I'm going to catch a lot of flack here, for writing an unpopular review, but hear me out.  I LOVE fantasy / kid movies -- it's perhaps my favorite genre.  But this is a generic fairy tale with a witless, lackluster script, and an unimaginative plot.  It's worth one watch, if you're wanting to pass time.

Pros:
- Pretty costumes (although whats up with that weird ribbon cage bustle?) and some nice scenery,
- Attractive humans (perhaps overtly so),
- Has all the bells and whistles of a fairy tale movie,
- Has unicorns and Tim Curry!!

Cons:
- Absolutely nothing original.  Blatantly lifts tropes and ideas from every popular fantasy book and movie -- Beauty and the Beast; Alice in Wonderland; Parent Trap; The Lion, Witch, & the Wardrobe, Clockwork Orange (costumes); and even Kirsten Dunst's Melancholia.  And they basically STOLE the last scene from The Last Unicorn ...which has one of the best endings of any fantasy movie, ever.  ...I guess they realized that.
- Meh graphics.  Wouldve preferred live action to half-baked CGI,
- Blas script, void of cleverness or wit,
- Cheesy and over-acted,
- Has unicorns and Tim Curry.  : /  This is definitely not the film to showcase the awesomeness of either.

If you want an awesome, sparkly fantasy kids movie with Tim Curry, watch Legend. (A little dark for really young children, but still great.)  Or, any of the aforementioned childrens movies.  (*Clockwork Orange is NOT for babes.)  Or, if you don't care about Tim Curry, thats fine, too.  There are still less meh / more amazing fantasy kids movies out there.",1483142400,,1595,4.759124087591241

3960874,1,B002OCX6YO,"Your basic fairy tale of a curse hundreds of years old that has only a few days to be broken. Also had it not been for Maria's father dying she would have never received the book and never moved in with her uncle and the curse would have not been broken. That brings up the question, exactly how did he die? Amd being cheesy is one thing but the film was boring as well. A story that progressed very slowly lacking any adventure and barely had any conflict in it filled with bad actors and horrible attempts at humor. If you like super cheesy fairytales go for it. If you like good movies then skip it. I am actually very confused as to the good reviews here considering critic reviews are horrible and even the audience scored on Rotten Tomatoes is very low. I am guessing there are a lot of paid reviews here and a lot of the reviews are from children.",1472947200,,854,4.245398773006135

The story is an original fairy tale, no remake of another tale. The characters kept me interested with their genuine acting. No blank stares or wooden actors here.

I just wish the people who made the movie ALSO loved the original story; I'm not sure why you would make a book into a movie and then REWRITE all the characters and the entire story?!  I was so disappointed...I had been forewarned that the movie was unlike the book but thought I would enjoy the costumes and scenery...sorry to say I found the strange steampunk-esque costuming very off-putting.  This movie is very dark and a little frightening for young viewers.  I hope someone will someday make a movie that is actually like the book.

I felt as if I'd entered a fairytale and never wanted to leave; Moonacre was a breathtakingly magical place and I wanted to share it with everyone near me. I struggled to finish the movie as they had completely changed the story, removing key moments. I found the characters fairly unlikable, and although the landscape was pretty, it wasn't magical or fairytale like.

3960985,5,B002OCX6YO,"This product arrived quickly an undamaged.

My wife and I enjoy a good fantasy movie from time to time, and this film fit the bill.  It is definitely not a blockbuster and would be considered perhaps more of a B class film in terms of acting and digital graphics.  However, we thought the graphics and acting were fine and surpassed our initial expectations.  The did plot seem a bit lacking, but that might be due to its adaptation from a supposedly beloved novel.  Movies never do seem to translate to film in the same quality and quantity.

To be quite honest, my wife and I have not had the opportunity to read this novel, so we took the film at face value.  As such, we were still pleased with the film for what it was.

There is an interview listed in the special features that points out an interesting thought, that is that J. K. Rowling loved this book and used it as inspiration for her Harry Potter series.  This is very interesting because you can see many connections and similarities (unicorn, snatcher like characters, etc).  We wonder how many more similarities might be present in the book as well.  We are not saying she stole any ideas, so lets not go down that path, it is just interesting to see where some of her inspiration stemmed from.

In either case, the piano song in this film is beautiful and who doesn't enjoy Tim Curry.  There are no curse words and this movie is perfect for a child's imagination (our niece loves it and watches it often).  For the price, we recommend this film.  Don't expect perfection, just enjoy the story for what it is.

We hope this review helps.",1395619200,,1603,4.475862068965517

3960993,4,B002OCX6YO,"If you like cute-sy, magical, fairytale-type movies, then you need to see this movie. ""The Secret of Moonacre"" has it all - dazzling costumes, beautiful scenery, romance, humor, magic, adventure, and some very cool special effects - especially a scene toward the end where the white horses run out of the water. I watched this for the actors - the handsome and highly talented Ioan Gruffudd (from 102 Dalmatians; Amazing Grace; Fantastic Four) and Tim Curry (Clue; Home Alone 2: Burke & Hare), but I enjoyed the storyline as well. Dakota Blue Richards plays her role as Maria beautifully. I think the actors are much bigger than this movie - and in saying that I mean that some of the acting wasn't on par because I don't think the script was extensive enough for them to use all their talent. As a dog lover and petsitter I loved Rolfe the dog. Miss Heliotrope is a riot, and she serves as a sort of comic relief character. Though I wish there had been a better ending to this movie - maybe including a wedding in a sort of epilogue? - it is a beautiful story about forgiveness and love, and you shouldn't miss watching this one :)",1392163200,,1132,4.5

3960998,1,B002OCX6YO,"This review is a combined effort of me and my daughter.  We'd like to begin by saying that almost all of what was lovely, dear, moving, and beautiful in the book has been lost in the movie.  Some of the loss is due to cuts from the book: all true spiritual content has gone (for example, one of the key sub themes was the village church and its pastor, Old Parson--God is present in the book but has been excised), instead the `magic' aspect of the book has been multiplied and darkened--from a `Narnian' type of magic to a pervasive modern kind of `cool' magic one sees so much of in movies nowadays.  Generally there is the modern `bad is good' (or at least cool) aspect in many places.  Despite the absurd amount of money thrown at this, much of it is a really cheap and shallow caricature of the original.
PLEASE READ ON TO THE END.
In short, this movie is not AT ALL like the book. Well, very few things are true to or from the book. If you insist on watching the film, at least read the book first (an ebook version is on nook and can be read with the nook app on any device, and it will be the best value for money you will spend this week.) The characters have all been changed.  Maria needs freckles and a heart that one can love.  Sir Benjamin is supposed to be somewhere in the 50s, he is much rounder (a triple chin) and is very wise and jolly. Ion Gruffudd was great in Hornblower, but here displays shocking insensitivity to the heart of the book.  Miss Heliotrope is partly done OK, but certainly does not burp loudly occasionally. Wrolf is a lion from start to finish. Digweed is not the sop painted here but a loving old man. He does not marry Heliotrope, thats just a gratuitous Hollywood throw-in.  Marmaduke Scarlet is not a blend of a magician and French chef, but is a dear old hunchback dwarf. Loveday does not wear weird feathers on her dress, or have that hard face --they have turned her into what they might have called a `brassy harpy' in the day the book was written.  Another reviewer asked why have they made her into a new-age witch?  Her son is Robin. Robin is a dear sweet boy, not a messed up de Noir. He has curly blondish hair, and does not wear a bowler hat!  My heart breaks at what they did to you, Robin.  And where is Old Parson, the village children, Zachariah the Cat, the real Serena the Hare, Wiggins the Dog, Paradise Hill, and charming Silverydew?  The producers left out many beautiful and pretty things from the book like the tea party and the three weddings.  They have definitely messed up this movie.  It is absolute proof, as if we needed more, that the world is growing darker and coarser.  Though we were put off by the trailer, I ordered the movie in hopes that with the millions of dollars budget a couple of the beautiful and evocative things from the book would be displayed--but there was nothing that resonated with me.  OK, her bedroom was nice and a few of the shots of Moonacre Hall.

There is an edgy grainy darkness like the new Alice in Wonderland, a pureness and humor of Princess Bride and the fantasy of Narnia.

My 11 year old girl LOVED it!  My husband and I really enjoyed it a lot.  A little older audience is needed but not necessary.  My 5 year old boy thought it was interesting but really did not catch the depth of the movie and at times appeared board until the action parts.

3961010,1,B002OCX6YO,"Goodness, this was an awful film. It was pretty enough to look at, and the actress playing Maria was good, but those are the only positive things I can say about it.

""The Little White Horse,"" the novel on which the film was based, is a charming but structurally weak book. The story needed to be tightened up and altered for the movie, but many of the film-makers' additions and changes made the story even weaker. The worst change was probably the recasting of Robin as not only one of the thugs but (weirdly) as the boy from ""A Clockwork Orange."" The revised Moonacre legend was so hokey and so miserably acted that I almost turned the DVD off. Maria's uncle and Loveday were both awful, and they topped off their performances with a sloppy kiss that should turn any preteen girl against sex for a couple of years.

I didn't mind the idea (new to the movie) that Moonacre Valley would be destroyed by the 5000th moon unless the Moon Princess's pearls were returned to the sea. If they could have been returned without heavy doses of slapstick, cliche, and misogyny (that's contempt for women, which surfaced in the book but was much worse here), the movie might have had a chance. But no ...

To top it off, the credits are accompanied by a cheesy pop song unrelated to anything in the film.

This movie will not harm anyone's little princess, and does feature a spunky and resourceful young heroine, but there are so many better choices.",1375228800,7,1441,4.552123552123552

3961018,3,B002OCX6YO,"The Secret of Moonacre does have a lot of beautiful English film imagery. It really is extraordinary in a lot of ways.  But the story unfortunately is just a bit weak. Sometimes very weak actually. Far too many things occur without any explanation whatsoever.  To be fair, it looks as if it might have been a quite a long movie when first produced, and a lot was cut out for time.  Of course when one cuts things out of a film, one mustn't delete important scenes that would exain what is going on in the story. Now should one?

Other than that. I thought the niece / princess girl was the only great actor in the whole thing, even though I adore British humor.  I simply love Monty Python's Flying Circus and Keeping Up Appearances.  I have also enjoyed Butterflies, To The Manor Born, and many other British TV shows and movies, but truly, some of the comedic acting was just embarrassingly silly at times.  Perhaps it was an American trying to be British.  Shameful.",1365292800,,969,4.497142857142857

3961030,5,B002OCX6YO,"Young Maria Merryweather (Dakota Blue Richards of ""The Golden Compass"" fame) finds herself without a father. He leaves her a book that tells the tale of a feud between two families.  As she reads, she finds that she is a member of one of the families and now must find the cause of the feud and correct this before her home known as Moonacre is destroyed forever.
There are many great actors in this film.  I will not name them all.  Yet one actor that stands out immediately is Tim Curry.  Mr. Curry has been in more than 80 films including Muppet Treasure Island (1996) where he plays a professional ""Long John Silver.""
This movie has a nice title ""The Secret of Moonacre"" loosely based on the book ""The Little White Horse"" by Elizabeth Goudge.  There are many movies with titles that look like they should belong to kid's books or viewable by children and turn out to be psychological thrillers on the dark side.  However this time if the type of film you are looking for is the lighter fairytale child friendly movie you're in luck; this movie is a magical movie that is kid friendly.  Still, it carries a message for us all.
Be sure to get the DVD or media that contains what is considered DVD extras as even though most of these are tedious.  They do give you a better understanding of what the story is trying to tell.",1357430400,,1325,4.423868312757202

3961041,3,B002OCX6YO,"I got this from the library, and might get a copy myself.

I'd like to see the book now, because the film can't have covered as much of it as needed to say what the author intended. I suspect a saga like Lord of the Rings would be required to get that across though.

There is a lot going on, visually and via story line.

There is a good start to the story when the curse is explained and the reason for the blood feud.

The premise is basic enough:  a sacred gift with special powers is given to a deserving person. Those around that person are undeserving and so create problems when they learn about it, and covet it. The supernatural giver gets offended, and a curse happens to those who abused the gift and/or the virtuous, worthy person. Someone way down the hereditary line ends up paying for the sins of the ancestors and has to put things right. A few supernatural critters get thrown in.

I'd have liked to know more about the fey in the story - assuming the cook and Lovejoy have fey powers from what the movie shows - and seen more of the lion and unicorn. As it is, the unicorn looks like a blurry white horse, and I didn't know it was a unicorn til I read the reviews.

I'm glad it ended happily, but am unclear just what happened at the end when the heroine tried to break the curse and jumped into the sea ... we just see that good came of it. I wasn't satisfied with just that.

Other reviewers said plenty about the bedroom ceiling and the outfits, so leave it at that.

Also, happy this is not an ""occult propaganda"" film, promoting or justifying sorcery, spellcasting, or any other kind of supernaturalism. It's only what was needed to tell the story without centering the tale on pursuit of power or human-monster relationships. (movies to remain anonymous)No bloodshed, no torture, no illicit behavior.

Not a deep story at all, I liked Inkheart better. I didn't care about any of the characters in Moonacre.",1351814400,2,1931,4.414084507042253

3961044,3,B002OCX6YO,"The Secret of Moonacre(released Feb/09)stars Dakota Blue Richards(The Golden Compass)as Maria Merriweather,Tim Curry as Coeur de Noir,Natascha McElhone as Loveday,and Ioan Gruffudd as Sir Bejamin Merryweather. This film is based on the childrens book by Elizabeth Goudge called""Little White Horse"".It is a good adaption of the book but the film has a decided lack of surprise or other elements that might keep the older set involved. The characters are quite plainly set apart from each other,the good in white and the bad in black. Even Tim Curry's name translates as Heart of Black,nothing startling here.
The plot involves young Maria whose father gets killed and is sent to live in the country with her uncle. She is left a large book ""The Ancient Chronicles of Moonacre Valley"",which she begins to read. By the time she reaches her uncle he has immediately confiscated it and put it away in a secret compartment in his library. The uncle is none too pleased to meet Maria,and her nanny who also tags along. The uncle introduces Maria to a horse and dog who are on the property and warns her not to enter the forest. Of course for a young a girl,anything verbotten is suddenly put on the to-do list. She enters the forest and gets taken by some bandits who live there.
Through the reading of the aforementioned book we learn that the characters in the book parallel the ones she keeps encountering in real life. Long ago a lady,pure of heart and soul,was due to marry her true love. However a string of enchanted pearls given her by the Moon,reveals the darkness in the heart of not only her father-in-law to be,but her husband to be. The wedding is stopped and the valley of Moonacre,and the mansion where Maria now resides,has been under a curse since then. It will take another pure of heart to reunite the people of the forest and those that reside in Moonacre. But this must be done before the 5000th moon comes around,which happens to be that night.
It seems Maria is the chosen one,so to speak and the forest bandits want the enchanted pearls of the legend,and believe Maria can lead her to them. Maria indeed finds them but is dogged by all the bandits,but one. The bandit leaders son has fallen for Maria and together they follow their noses and end up on a promontory with castle ruins. All main characters are there and it is make or break time for Maria,who has pearls in hand. She first throws the necklace off the cliff only to have it come back to her. As the moon approaches she breaks the necklace and throws them piecemeal into the water,but they come back and attach themselves to her dress. Finally she jumps in to the water. Suddenly a wall of water in the distance rises up with horses galloping at top speed toward the cliff. There is a huge splash and a unicorn appears,with Maria on its back. Maria has successfully lifted the curse and saved Moonacre.
The film is chock full of different creatures such as unicorns,a lion,and a large black dog. But even these cannot quite lift this film out of the pedestrian feel,look and pace it has. This film would have been more successful about 40-50 years ago,but now with all the technology and myriad of extremely smart childrens books that have been put to celluloid,this one just seems so antiquated in its theme. As I say,it may interest the small fry(pre teens)but not the adults nearly as much.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/w a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,interviews with the cast,deleted scenes,extra behind the scenes footage and the trailer.
All in all a simple,old school plot about good vs evil,a girl with an old book who must unite the characters she reads about,who are also in the now. It has a magical quality and the production values are high,but in the end it is geared much more towards the small fry in your family.",1348185600,3,3857,4.673529411764706

2)Characters are quirky.

3) Maria, who is orphaned at an early age discovers she is of royal bloodline.

4) Both have magical objects such as a magic mirror.

5) Both have a secret book in a library.

6) Luna Lovegood was clearly based on Moonacre character Loveday.

Maria is orphaned and goes to live with her uncle, who is very cold to her and her caretaker, Ms. Heliotrope. While there, magical things happen and she is instructed not to go into the forest where the Du Noirs roam. (They all dress in black.)

While there is no dragon to slay, there is a curse that will destroy the land if not lifted before the 5,000th moonrise. Throw in a centuries old family feud and you have a face paced story that the kids will enjoy. If you are looking for historical accuracy, a faithful telling of the book (which I did not read), or something that makes sense, this is not it. The costumes were lovely, but completely nonsensical at times. The people in black running around the woods waiting to kill trespassers were illogical. The ending makes no sense at all except that it seems the producer wanted to give a feel good, fantasy ending appropriate for children.

Though there are some very good actors in the movie, I found the standard of acting to be quite poor.
As an adult who loved the book ""The Little White Horse"", I did not like the changes they made to the storyline and characters as I felt they were quite negative. The book had the contrast of light and dark, good and evil, however the movie just seems to be very dark overall.

Of these, one of her best is ""The Little White Horse"", a whimsical blending of Dickens, Grimm, Austen, Grahame, and others. Great food. Heroic animals. Often very funny. Also mysterious and haunting. Sentimental, and moral, but exactly right.
The film ""Secret of Moonacre"" has as much to do with the original Goudge book as the Shirley Temple version of ""Heidi"" has to do with the Spyri original.
Obviously some people enjoy the film.
I happen to prefer the book.

Happily, because the film chose to use a different title, there should be scope for a remake, under the original title, sticking faithfully to the proven elements of the book.
If Emma Thompson can script a faithful, beautiful version of Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"", then it is feasible that someone of that calibre and sensitivity could script a faithful film-version of ""The Little White Horse"".
Until then, I will go on re-reading the book, while crying out for a faithful remake!

3961064,5,B002OCX6YO,"My husband was randomly browsing Netflix and the cover image of this movie caught my eye. So we settled on watching it. Right from the very beginning, I was hooked! There's always something enchanting about a moon princess, even if I don't really know what that means.

When Maria is forced to leave her home and stay with an uncle she never knew she had, she's more than unhappy. She doesn't know where she is or who this man is and most importantly; she doesn't know what's up with that strange white horse, those bandits in the forest she's being told she can't go into or why the stars on her bedroom ceiling are moving! All she knows is that there is something very strange going on and her uncle seems to know, but isn't telling her.

Maria is your typical curious little girl who dives head first into danger just because someone told her not go there. She's brave and adventurous and pretty darn sneaky! I absolutely loved Maria, even if every time she set foot into the forest it made me cringe. I also loved her dresses (they had a sort of Wicked Musical Emerald City feel to them) and her bedroom! Oh my, how I would love a magical bedroom like that one!

Robin was also another character I really liked, from the very beginning he catches your attention, or maybe it was just me... he sort of reminded me of Rufio, but his costume was much better (Robin's, not Rufio's). The more he has to set out to capture Maria, the more you can sort of sense he doesn't want to... which makes you wonder why not? His father seems to be obsessed with seeking revenge, it's strange to wonder why Robin didn't follow in those footsteps. Even if his father seems a bit... loopy about it all.

All the characters in this movie were fantastic. There was humor, magic and secrets. I absolutely enjoyed it and I personally think it deserves more attention! If you're in the mood for a light movie about magic, then I suggest you give this a try!

3961070,3,B002OCX6YO,"This movie seems like it could have been the next Narnia, but it isn't. It's not bad. It's a cute little fairy tale story, particularly aimed towards young girls. However, two aspects really undermine the movie for me. First, the plot seems half-baked. You don't really learn enough about the families and their feud and the power of the pearls until long into the movie. The ending and Maria Merryweather's choice seem highly contrived (I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a big leap of faith). Overall, it seems like we only get tiny tastes of that sort of magic, but the character development and acting aren't enough to make up for the lack of wonder. The other big problem is that the wardrobes are awful. The bad guys wear outfits that look like they come straight out of Clockwork Orange. Maria always seems to find herself in some 19th century ball gown, which just doesn't inspire adventure. Moonacre isn't a bad movie and certainly worth putting on for kids, but it lacks broader appeal.",1313884800,,1003,4.672316384180791
3961071,5,B002OCX6YO,"My six-year-old daughter loves the Harry Potter and Narnia stories, and has watched HP 1-4, and several of the Narnia movies. She's been asking me if there are any other fantasy-themed movies she can watch and after scrolling through a couple of titles, I came across The Secret of Moonacre. We watched it together and it is wonderful family entertainment. Although the target audience is elementary-aged children to young adults, I found myself enchanted by the movie. It is well-cast and beautifully filmed.

The story centers around 13-year-old Maria Merryweather (Dakota Blue Richards), who finds herself penniless and without a home after her beloved father's death. Accompanied by her faithful governess, Miss Heliotrope (Juliet Stevenson), the pair move from busy London to remote Moonacre Valley to live with Maria's reclusive uncle, Sir Benjamin (Ioan Gruffudd). There Maria begins experiencing strange happenings, and soon comes to understand that Moonacre Valley and its inhabitants are under a curse, brought about by men's greed. Soon it dawns upon Maria that she is the Moon Princess and it is left to her to find the missing moon pearls and bring peace to the valley once again.

The lead actress does an incredible job in her role as the spirited Maria Merryweather. This young lass has talent and looks to take her far. The supporting cast does a good job too - Ioan Gruffudd is credible as the brooding and lovelorn Sir Benjamin; Natascha McElhone convincingly  portrays his estranged betrothed Loveday;and,  Tim Curry is a hoot as the villain Coeur De Noir.

There are shades of Narnia in this film, especially in the portrayal of the forbidding and loyal black lion. Though there are elements that are reminiscent of other, more famous fantasy stories, The Secret of Moonacre was a delightful watch and its interesting plot and engaging characters will hold up to repeated viewings.",1312675200,,1902,5.122580645161291

She and her nanny are invited out to their family home in the country, called ""Moonacre"" to stay with her uncle, now her ward.
When they get there, they find her uncle is completely unfriendly and seemingly disinterested, simply sheltering her because it is his family duty. Most of the estate is closed off to her, but in her explorations, she meets a few funny characters, most notably the chef, who looks somewhat like a human sized garden gnome, and a ""devil dog"". She is told not to wander into the woods surrounding the estate, as her uncle ""Cant protect her there"".
What follows is a young girls adventure, both on the estate and the woods, as she solves the mystery surrounding the area she is in before the valley that the estate and woods are in, is destroyed.

I can't bare to think what it is doing to our children's developing minds.  I have found a lot of things that I am actually very proud to share with my daughter and this is on that list.

3961110,5,B002OCX6YO,"This is still an amazing story, a great movie, good acting (except near the end when everything feels rushed)... and I've watched it four times now.

This movie is directed at young audiences, very young, so perhaps that is why the hint of romance at the middle/end of the movie stays only that... a hint. For myself that leaves the expectation that there will be a sequel to resolve the emotional loose ends (hopefully?). On the other hand, another romance that was barely there culminated in what seemed like a marriage proposal at the end of the film. The third romance that was really focused on throughout the movie, though always off-stage (so to speak), did culminate in a marriage proposal... Maybe? The one marriage proposal the audience most expects to see (the romance that is featured throughout the film) is skipped! It isn't shown! I am feeling a definite lack of emotional closure, romantically speaking. Besides that, the ending feels rushed.

Aside from those issues this is a movie worth seeing. Great actors, costuming, story, et cetera. So, definitely worth seeing... but be prepared to mentally write your own ending after the movie.",1298851200,2,1154,4.943298969072165

This endeavor was ultimately letdown by inconsonant direction, story mishandling, and casting errors.  Sadly, all this movie produced was one long dissonant note, oh what might have been.
At times it seemed like two different movies attempting to coexist in the same framework.  There was slapstick in one house and shouts of ""kill the girl!"" in the other.  A disappearing unicorn, a lion/dog, a chef who can't stay long in one spot, a belching governess, a reject from A Clockwork Orange, thugs with knives bent on slitting throats, and a vicious Tim Curry sporting a comic hood (like those put on birds of prey).  What do all these elements have in common?  By mere coincidence they just happen to be in the same movie, or, at least that's how it feels.  It also didn't help that the story got off to a slow start then kept veering awkwardly from fun and funny to deadly serious and just deadly.  Ioan Gruffudd lacked commitment (I got the impression he'd rather be somewhere else doing something better), ""get my agent, why am I in this?""  Tim Curry was way too intense, Natascha McElhone and her cheekbones was wasted.  Okay, yes, I will admit the actress with the neverending name was quite convincing as Maria.  She makes this movie watchable.  And, when it was good it was fantastic to watch, when it wasn't, I cringed and wished I was reading the book instead (which I'm hoping is better).
One also has to wonder why, if this is a 2008 movie, filmed in 2007, did it take so long to show up on DVD, never mind that it never received wide release in theaters in the US.",1297555200,,1714,4.676666666666667

She discovers that she is the last of the ""moon princesses"" who can save the surrounding valley from destruction -- but only if she meets certain challenges and tests of her character.  The look of the production design is very appealing and interesting -- my 15 year-old called it ""steampunk"", sort of Victorian/dystopian.  Dakota Blue Richards does a good job as Maria Merryweather and Juliet Stevenson is priceless as the governess Miss Heliotrope.  Tim Curry is suitably creepy as the leader of the de Noir clan.

Maria jumps into the ocean to sacrifice for her family, but within seconds, she is rescued by a beautiful unicorn and the end is magically and nicely tied up.  The music is beautiful as well.

My daughter loaned me the movie after I had loaned her the book.  I was very disappointed.  The story was turned around, important parts were left out.  A lot of the action revolves around the local church and the local pastor.  The children of the village retake the monastery stolen by the Merriweathers for the benefit of the church.  All this was left out.  Very difficult to remove religion from an Elizabeth Goudge book without tearing it to pieces, which is what happened here.
Visually the movie distracts from the story and does not put the theme forward.  The book takes place in the real world, 1842 England, with magical variations, such as the little white horse, but it is solidly in England.  Bustled dresses revealing the strapping of a bustle petticoat is not accurate to any time or theme, much less 1842.
This is J K Rowling's favorite childhood book.  It is the favorite childhood book of many people who read it over and over, and know it well.  The book is also a very positive experience, which the movie is not.

He already was a fan of Tim Curry's recent characters through films of Terry Pratchett novels, so I thought this would be a good introduction to other favorite literature.

Forget it!

This film might have been inspired by EG's novel (which is reportedly a great favorite of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling) but the story is all but unrecognizable.  The characterization is all messed up and everything that is inspiring and special about the novels of EG is completely left out. About the only thing about the film that I could find praise-worthy is the costuming which is quite whimsical and unexpected.  It is the only thing about the film that I could find magical and appropriate.

Specifically and first of all, I was disappointed in the portrayal of the uncle as a young, hostile, domineering misogynist. Not at all the character he was described in the novel.  Although Tim Curry usually likes to play villains these days, I could see him playing the uncle more convincingly than the actor who was finally cast. Juliet Stephenson was well cast as Miss Heliotrope. Messing up the other various relationships among the characters was very off-putting for me as a fan of the novel.  I suppose the film was okay as a fantasy, but it was not what I was led to expect as an adaptation of the work of a favorite author.

I also want to sing comic songs on the graves of reviewers who think the imagery is taken from other movies.  No, Elizabeth Goudge did it first.
I can understand changing the story a bit - but think things could have been tightened up to include some of the other storylines.
Why on earth make Rowlf black?  Why does Robin have to be on the wrong side?  Why do the villagers seem so mean - greeting Maria with ""She's a witch!"" instead of ""Be you the one, dearie?"" Why oh why didn't they manage to include Old Parson? I would have been a lot happier with Old Parson and the children of Silvery Dew along for the ride.
BUT.... visually, it's beautiful.  I adore the costumes, impractical as they are for roaming in the forest!  I enjoyed the whole 'look' of the movie.  Elizabeth Goudge's descriptions of people are so detailed it seems a shame they didn't stick to that, but Maria and Miss Heliotrope are wonderful exceptions.

(1.) Acting? Well, as a comparison I watched ""Winter's Bone"" after watching this movie and ""The Secret..."" was forgettably superficial with ""acting by the numbers"" 15 second highly edited takes most apparent. No comparison to ""Winter's"" less professional but much more engaging performances.
(2.) CGI really poorly done, and heavily borrowed (ha, ha) like the Unicorns out of the sea; the changeable lion; the moon.
(3.) Cheap and time worn props and costumes like the dinner table with countless goblets; swords that look like they're made of wood; clothing that looked like someone's imagination was not into the story but more into what weird impractical designs can one conjure up. Bowler hats, Robin (i.e. Batman version) masks and black eye underliner - unimaginative. Cawing crows and shrieking hawks, especially when overdone as a time filler and mood setter, were just tedious.
(4.) Storyline, directing and editing: How much can one unimaginably steal from other movies ""Lion, Witch & Wardrobe"", ""The Last Unicorn"", ""Neverending Story"" and others. As just one small example of poor directorial control is shown by the Princess drowning in the ocean at movie's end with her long hair flowing in the water then rescued seconds later and her hair is suddenly professionally curled and dried?

3961134,5,B002OCX6YO,"The Secret of Moonacre played at our local theater last evening and I caught it with my daughter (age 10) who had seen the trailer for it recently and had been talking about it ever since. What a beautiful film, both physically (what you see) as well as story-wise (what you get).

A filmed fairy tale based on the acclaimed novel ""The Little White Horse"", the story of a young girl recently orphaned is filled with joy, fright, heartbreak, laughter, love, hate and hope. Sent to live with her eccentric uncle at his very mysterious home of Moonacre Manor, a young Maria finds herself in a world of magic and myth. Discovering that an ancient family feud has kept Moonacre in danger for many a year, Maria also learns that she is the next moon princess and that she alone may be able to succeed where others before her have failed. From there, the story takes you on a journey that is captivating throughout as Maria attempts to save Moonacre from slipping into eternal darkness, something that must be accomplished before the 5000th moon rises, something she cannot quite accomplish alone. As I do not want to put any spoilers within this commentary, I will only tell you that the final scene of this film is simply upliftingly fantastic.

The Secret of Moonacre is perfectly suited for children. I would say for ages 8-15, more for girls than boys, but there are elements to the film that boys, too, will enjoy. The special effects are superb starting with Maria's bedroom which is located atop Moonacre Manor with a clear ceiling that lets her view the starry / dreamy nights while laying in her bed. For girls there is a beautiful Unicorn and a very rare Moonacre rabbit; for boys there are outlaws in the forest (led by Tim Curry btw), an evil-looking but protective dog and an extroadinarily unique black lion. Moonacre is a love story and Moonacre is a joyous fairytale. It is a film with a female lead herione who challenges a world she faces that is filled with obstacles. Moonacre comes complete with lessons taught (i.e. how jealously and hate are destructive and yet they can be overcome). It is a film definitely worth repeating as its filled with small details that only repeat viewing will expose. The Secret of Moonacre is destined for greatness.

My daughter already wants to own it and for sure, she will. I've already placed an order for the blu ray version which I can only imagine will be stunning to watch.",1281657600,42,2428,4.641860465116279
3961135,4,B002OCX6YO,"A unicorn, an ancient curse, magical pearls, a blood feud, a forest haunted by bandits, and a bit of ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance (without the suicide). ""The Secret of Moonacre"" is something of a modern fairy tale, and Gabor Csupo films it in the style is deserves -- a lush, exquisitely magical little tale full of magic.

When her father dies, Maria Merrywether (Dakota Blue Richards) discovers that his debts have left her penniless -- all she inherits is a storybook about the Moon Princess and her magical pearls.

She and her governess are sent to live with Sir Benjamin Merryweather (Ioan Gruffudd), her grumpy uncle who lives in a vast decaying mansion. But soon Maria begins to realize that something strange is afoot -- it turns out the story of the Moon Pearls is true, and a strange young woman named Loveday (Natascha McElhone) warns her of what will happen in just a few days.

And along the way, she discovers that the Merryweathers and the bandit clan called the De Noirs have been at war over the pearls for centuries. However, the only way that Maria can find the pearls is by enlisting the help of Robin De Noir (Augustus Prew) -- and if she doesn't succeed, the entire valley of Moonacre will be destroyed.

""The Secret of Moonacre"" is loosely based on Elizabeth Goudge's classic fantasy novel ""The Little White Horse,"" although they take some hefty liberties in the name of drama. However, it's still a lovely little movie with a distinctly British flavor, as well as a mixture of wide-eyed optimism and the usual stuff about pride, getting along, love overcoming all, and so on.

The script is a mixed bag -- the dialogue has moments of banality (""It is not the pearls but the greed in our hearts which brings us this misery""), but also some enchanting humour (""How can I possibly go to live in the country? It's full of... the countryside!""). And a small warning: the De Noirs look like refugees from ""A Clockwork Orange.""

But the movie is worth getting if nothing else for the sets and scenery. Director Gabor Csupo paints the entire movie with lush magical forests, a bandit citadel with a dungeon, a bedroom with murals and a sea-bed, dusty old libraries and an overgrown kitchen where an elfin cook bounces around like a Lewis Carroll character. Nearly every scene looks like a pre-Raphaelite painting, and Csupo milks it of every ounce of fairy-tale beauty and magic.

And though this is only her second movie, Dakota Blue Richards easily takes center stage and gives a gutsy flair to her ladylike character. Gruffudd and McElhone are quite good as the grumpy aristocrat and the pretty hermit, and Tim Curry is sneeringly nasty as Coeur De Noir (although he seems totally lost in the last scene).

""The Secret of Moonacre"" has some flaws, but it's still a charming little fairytale that enchants the senses and makes you feel warm'n'fuzzy. A lovely little treat.",1278892800,54,2889,4.741035856573705

8375936,2,B002OCX6YO,"How dare these upstarts steal and pervert the classic story of ""The Little White Horse"" by Elizabeth Goudge!? Not only did they change critical aspects of the story (especially distorting the incredibly wonderful character of Robin and his relationship to Maria, the personality of Sir Benjamin, and the atmosphere of Moonacre, not to mention the complete removal of critical characters such as Zachariah the cat, the parson, and the children of Moonacre village), but the casting of the main characters was terrible, their acting was lousy (or perhaps the direction, as some of these actors are excellent in other roles, IMO), and even the special effects were poorly done. The punk-like costuming and other gimmicks were a sorry (and anachronistic) attempt to distract from the many shortcomings of this film. Elizabeth Goudge has surely had a few turns in her grave thanks to these folks. IF you have never had the experience of reading this very special book, then perhaps you will see value in this film. So whether it's better to recommend reading it, or to recommend that viewers remain in a kind of ignorant five-star bliss, I am not wise enough to say. I DO wish that movie producers would leave good literature well enough alone unless they can REALLY do a story justice on film.",1519776000,,1289,4.91743119266055
