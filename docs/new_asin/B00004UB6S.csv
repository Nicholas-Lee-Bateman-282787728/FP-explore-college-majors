1355704,4,B00004UB6S,"I thought it was great fun and a reminder of the fruit and vegetable markets in Dublin's Moore Street where most Dublin mothers bought their produce and interacted with the most colorful group of citizens in Ireland. The language is salty, but the repartee is terrific.  Marian Dwyer shines as Houston's pal. Dwyer has now entered the cast of Ballykissangel, aired on selected PBS stations across the country.  These earthy city folk were known for their malapropisms, like  worrying about their ""various veins,"" and selling their ""Christmas declarations."" Irish revieweers didn't like the movie --- probably because they are now getting rich on the Celtic Tiger and don't want to be reminded!!",967593600,3,694,5.178571428571429

1355805,5,B00004UB6S,"So says Agnes Brown who may not have the luck of the Irish but does what she can with the fortune she's been given.

We meet Agnes soon after the death of her husband. Redser was stumbling home from the pub when the wheels of a bus suddenly landed on him, leaving Agnes bereft and with seven hungry kids to feed.  Poor Mr. Brown may not have been much of a breadwinner before the fateful encounter with the trolley, but what little he brought in from work or the dole put food on the table. Agnes can't wait for the grief to subside.  She gets the news and heads straight to city hall to start fighting with the bureaucracy for her widow's pension. She explains to the clerk that her husband was a kitchen porter. When the clerk wants to know where he worked, Agnes looks at her like she's seeing a bug: In the kitchen, I suppose.  Obviously it's going to be a long fight.

We spend the next few months with Agnes and fall in love with her. The role is beautifully played by Anjelica Huston who also produced and directed this funny, touching little treasure. I don't know about you, but I can't get enough of Ms. Huston. She improves whatever she touches. Her first directorial project, Buster out of Carolina (name has been changed because I'm afraid Amazon might not permit the actual term, which has to do with illegitimacy), is another fine piece of work; both are tinged with but not spoiled by a great affection for her characters and lots of emotional performances.

The film co-stars Marion O'Dwyer as best friend Marion Monk. Agnes and Marian spend their days together smoking their ciggies, drinking countless cups of tea, gossiping about their friends and neighbors, and occasionally analyzing Marion's enjoyment of 'the organism' -- an event that Agnes has not experienced despite six sons and a daughter. The two are loud, brassy and funny. They work together in one of the great open-air Dublin markets, selling vegetable that they transport via baby carriage. The year is 1968, but with the exception of beehive hairdos and Tom Jones, it might be 1918 or 1948. Agnes lives at the tail-end of that never-ending era, where the Jakes was usually outdoors and communal, if you lived on the wrong side of the river it was assumed you were poor and no better than you had to be, and when you needed a coat, you stood on line at the St. Vincent De Paul. If Da was a drinker, the coat got pawned on Wednesday night to tide the family over until Friday's paycheck, if there was one.

Agnes was no different than her neighbors, but now things are a little tougher. She's making do, but barely. The veggie stand lets her eke out a living. It's only the extras, like shoes for the kids, or paying off the local loan shark for the money needed for Redser's funeral and getting the kids out of trouble, that are hard to come by. Still life is good, except when sickness, loss and maybe even love make things a little tricky. But one thing we see early on, Agnes is a survivor. She's nobody's fool.

I can't think of a film I've enjoyed more. Great slice of life, great characters, great acting. There are situations that will make you laugh out loud and others that really touch your heart. The film captivates you from the beginning and spell lasts until you almost reach the end. It's that ending that's a problem: it just doesn't work.  What was Huston thinking?

SPOILER ALERT. Tom Jones shows up and saves the day and ruins the film. To begin with, the entire situation is false, it doesn't work on any level. We get kids running around a hotel in a scene that feels a way too Brady Bunch, they meet Tom Jones and Hey Presto involve him in the action so he can show up on Agnes' doorstep and save the day.  It's as bad as it sounds. Tom Jones is all wrong for the part, for one thing. It's supposed to be 1968, we're supposed to be seeing Tom as the amazingly sexy young star he was then. But the film was about 40 years later and Tom Jones is no Tom Jones anymore and he really doesn't have much to do but stand around while the other actors register surprise and wonder whenever he shows up. The whole thing feels a little too deus ex machine and slapdash.

Still, if you can forgive and forget the last few minutes, this is a winner. Arno Chevrier is believable and could not be better as would be suitor Pierre. He reminds me of Gerard Depardieu, big and ugly and sexy. Marion O'Dwyer is so good, I can't wait to see more of her work.  Ray Winstone as Mr. Billy, the local moneylender and thug, is so good, you can't take your eyes off of him. Treat yourself to this one. A movie doesn't need car chases, billion dollar FX explosions, flying dragons or crouching wizards to be great. This is for the grown ups.

Enjoy!

NOTE: If you try to find this title the internet, be sure you're getting the movie with Anjelica Huston. There is also a very old TV show about a foul-mouthed Irish woman of the same name, played by a fellow named Brendan O'Carroll, who wrote a series of books about the Agnes Brown character. The show aired in the U.S. a couple of years ago and won a bunch of cable awards.  It's oddly surreal and a little hard to describe. Imagine a mix of Coronation Street and Are You Being Served with by Benny Hill and John Cleese wandering around. O'Carrol's first book is called Agnes Brown in the U.S., and The Mammy at home. There are three or four sequels. If you like the movie, you'll probably end up hunting down the books. They're worth five stars too.",1398211200,,5483,4.413861386138614

It is fairly predictable and is sometimes cheaply sentimental, but so what?  It is both hilarious and achingly sad, but I just love it.

1355849,3,B00004UB6S,"Angelica Huston directs and stars in this lightweight adaptation of Brendan O'Carroll's novel ""The Mammy"".  Suddenly widowed Agnes Browne, a mother of seven, is left to raise her brood on pauper's wages. Not surprisingly, they're a handful to manage. Ciaran Owens of Angela's Ashes is aboard playing a son who gambles, smokes and runs afoul of a loan shark.

The story line descends into a series of haphazard vignettes involving Agnes Browne's daily struggle to keep her sanity and sense of humor among the tenement-life characters surrounding her. A dear friend, played by Marion O'Dwyer, dies of breast cancer and causes the requisite trauma to mind and soul that the loss of a friend should.  Curiously the death of her husband in the opening scene causes quite a different response from Agnes Browne. With friend Marion in tow, she heads for the public assistance office to apply for the dole.  Asked how long her husband has been deceased she tells the clerk, ""About four hours,"" and bursts into laughter. Ah, the Irish. Humor in any situation.

Between keeping her kids in line and peddling fruit at a fruit stand, Agnes has little time for recreation. She manages to nurture a budding romance with a French baker, played by Arno Chevrier. Singer Tom Jones arrives for a timely cameo that ultimately determines how the movie ends.  Although Agnes lacks the money to purchase tickets for his Dublin concert, the Browne brats come to the rescue, making it like junior prom night for her. A date with Tom, a limo, and the loan shark receives his just due, all in one scene.",1206230400,,1577,4.822222222222222

1355852,3,B00004UB6S,"Agnes Browne (Anjelica Huston, 1999)

Brendan O'Carroll's much-loved novel is made into a film by (and starring) Anjelica Huston. Does it work? Conditionally, yes. If you look at it as a character sketch, a slice of life without much of a plot, it does work. It's a slice of Agnes Browne's life, anyway. Agnes, played with a surprising coarseness (that's right for the character) by Huston goes along, caring for her seven kids, recently widowed, selling vegetables in the market square with her best friend Marion (Irish Jam's Marion O'Dwyer), being romanced by lunkheaded French handyman (Arno Chevrier of The Chambermaid on the Titanic), dodging the local loan shark, Mr. Billy (the great Ray Winstone), from whom she borrowed money to pay for her husband's funeral, and dreaming of seats at the upcoming sold-out Tom Jones concert.

If you're looking for a movie with a strong storyline, keep going when you chance upon it in the video store. As a character sketch, though, it's a pretty good one; the principals are all decent actors, though only Huston and Winstone really shine (not surprising, as the two of them have more experience than the rest of the cast combined), and Huston handles the source material with a deftness that belies the observation that Agnes Browne was her sophomore effort behind the camera.

Not a major film, but an overall pleasant distraction. ***",1166572800,2,1383,4.978354978354979
1355853,4,B00004UB6S,"Some movies never get the attention they should. My parents rented one of these this weekend. It was called Agnes Browne and was actually based on a novel I reviewed for Ohio University's The Post, The Mammy. The book had me in stitches. The movie was not quite as good, but not quite as good as excellent is still great.
The film stars Angelica Huston. Actually, she does just about everything in this movie. The story starts off with a woman going to collect widow's pension. Her husband has only been dead half a day and already she is moving on. She has to for the sake of her seven children.

The film is funny and sad. It is the same as many Irish movies. There is humor amid great heartache and so one is left feeling a little unsure of their emotions at the film's end. The author of the book this movie was based in acted in the film Angela's Ashes, so he knew how to extract the right combination of emotions.

There is one more aspect of this film worth mentioning. Angelica Huston is not the only big name in it. Tom Jones has an important, although brief role. He is elevated to his sex-symbol status of days of old. And quite frankly, with him in a movie, how can you go wrong?!?

1355866,5,B00004UB6S,"Agnes Browne is one of my favorite Irish films of all time. Set in Dublin in 1967, it is about the struggles of Agnes, played by Academy Award winner Angelica Huston, who also directed the film, A Moore Street fruit and veg stand vendor, whose husband dies in an auto accident, and she is left to raise their seven children. Anjelica had much of her early education in Ireland, so she knows about Irish life, and made sure that her film was loaded with realism.  My wife was born and raised in Ireland, and says that Anjelica's Dublin accent was flawless. She was not so kind about other American acresses, playing Irish parts, like Julia Roberts in ""Michael Collins,"" or Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York.""  The language in this film might seem a little strong to somw viewers, but it is very realistic for Dubliners, so it adds to the film's quest to just ""Tell it like it is."" Huston surrounded herself with experienced Irish actors, led by Marion O'Dwyer, who plays her best friend and fellow street vendor Marion.  The friendship between these two is one of the highlights of this amazing film, but the interaction between the two of them with other venders carries a lot of weight also. In her situation, Agnes was bound to have financial problems, and went to local gangster ""Mister Billy,"" who thinks nothing of dealing with children and has an unorthodox collection system, and no sympathy for the poor souls he lends money to. Overall, this film keeps drawing you in, and makes you want more, which is why you feel kind of sorry when it ends, because you want it to continue.

1355869,4,B00004UB6S,"""Agnes Browne"" is a genuine charmer, a simple, but heartwarming comedy/drama directed by and starring the magnificent Anjelica Huston.  Set in a lower class Dublin neighborhood in 1967, the story centers around Agnes, an attractive woman whose husband has just died leaving her sole provider for her seven children, ranging in age from early adolescence to diaper-wetting toddler.  With the love of her best friend, Marion, to support her (this almost seems to be more of a love story between them than between Agnes and Pierre, the local Frenchman who falls for her), Agnes learns to cope with financial set backs, the neighborhood extortionist, the growing pains of her children and, most tragically, the terminal illness of someone very dear to her heart.
""Agnes Browne"" could have emerged as a heavy-handed wallow in tragedy and bathos, but those involved both in front of and behind the cameras have managed to maintain an air of breezy likeability even in the film's darkest moments.  If there is a criticism to be leveled against the movie, it would probably be that the film is actually - at a mere 92-minute running time - a bit too short.  We occasionally feel we are being rushed from one event to another without time for proper reflection.  Moreover, a number of the characters - prime among them Pierre and several of the children - tend to get lost in the shuffle.  As the silent, sensitive and understanding merchant who woos and wins Agnes, Pierre simply seems too much like the ""ideal man"" stereotype who always seems to be just waiting in the wings the moment one of these attractive but harried movie widows/divorcees is starting life anew out on her own.
A much more well rounded and three-dimensional character is that of Agnes' best friend, Marion, (beautifully portrayed by Marion O'Dwyer), a warmhearted, fun-loving woman who provides the kind of confidant and companion that all of us would love to have in our lives.  But the real selling point of ""Agnes Browne"" is, undoubtedly, the luminous performance delivered by Anjelica Huston herself.  This fine actress manages to flow seamlessly in and out of a wide variety of emotionally demanding moods and moments.  Stern and demanding one moment, she can be forgiving and loving the next.  Whether alternately strong or vulnerable, idealistic or pragmatic, heartbroken or joyful, Agnes is a character who demands and earns the complete attention and respect from the audience who can't help but be riveted by her every move.  With her glowing portrayal, Huston literally lights up the center of this movie.
Yes, the fairy tale ending may seem a bit out of place perhaps.  Yet, in a way, for all its moments of death, heartbreak and sorrow, ""Agnes Browne"" never really aspires to be anything BUT a charming fairy tale.  Given the quality of so much of what we see up on the screen, we really couldn't ask for more.",984268800,25,2888,4.89344262295082
1355870,4,B00004UB6S,"In Dublin, 1967, a woman with seven children is suddenly faced with the travails of widowhood in ""Agnes Browne,"" directed by and starring Anjelica Huston.  After the unexpected death of her husband, life becomes something less than a picnic for Agnes (Huston), what with children ranging in age from two to fourteen and no assets to speak of.  She keeps her head above water and some food on the table by selling fruit at an outdoor market, but makes barely enough to make ends meet, while she awaits her widow's pension from her late husband's union.  But even when and if it comes, she realizes it won't be enough on which to live.  It's a bleak state of affairs for Agnes, who luckily has a dear friend, Marion (Marion O'Dwyer), who is always there for her; and with friendship, a sense of humor, and the dream of seeing Tom Jones in concert, it's enough to keep her going as she manages to take it all one day at a time.  There are poignant moments in this character driven, heartwarming film, as well as some funny ones; Huston has done an outstanding job of creating a mood and an atmosphere that brings the Irish working class vividly to life, and she populates her landscape with characters who are not only real, but incredibly rich in their humanity.  She captures the heart of Agnes and the others with an emotional depth that draws in the viewer and allows the empathy through which an intimate bond with the characters is established.  And they quickly become more than just characters in a story; these are people you come to care about, and when something bad or untoward happens to any of them, you feel it just as deeply as they.  Huston gives a terrific performance as Agnes, imbuing her with both a strength and vulnerability that make her real.  She has a look of world-weariness about her, but there's a glint of hope and humor in her eyes, which are like a doorway to her soul; you need only look there to know what she is feeling inside.  And Huston plays it all so perfectly.  In her motion picture debut, O'Dwyer gives a memorable performance as well, as  Marion; though nondescript in appearance, there is nevertheless something charming about this woman, and it has everything to do with ""character.""  Through her unwavering loyalty to Agnes she personifies the meaning of friendship, and exemplifies how invaluable a true friend can be, especially in times of need.  It's a touching portrayal that is one of the strengths of the film.  The supporting cast includes Niall O'Shea (Mark), Ciaran Owens (Frankie), Roxanna Williams (Cathy), Carl Power (Simon), Mark Power (Dermot), Ray Winstone (Mr. Billy), June Rodgers (Fat Annie), Jennifer Gibney (Winnie the Mackerel) and Tom Jones as himself.  No stranger to all things Irish, Huston was the perfect choice to star in and direct this project.  With ""Agnes Browne,"" she succeeds splendidly, with a film that is striking both visually and emotionally.  And, lest it be taken for granted, one need but consider Alan Parker's ""Angela's Ashes,"" which visited the same territory but came off flat and uninspired, especially compared to Huston's film, which so distinctly and fervently imparts the essence of the proud Irish poor.  Largely ignored during it's theatrical release, this film hopefully will find a second life on DVD and video, and realize the acclaim it so richly deserves.  A real sleeper, this is a gem of a film just waiting to be discovered.",982540800,16,3431,4.783050847457627
1355871,5,B00004UB6S,"Set in Dublin in the late 1960s, it stars Angelica Huston and is totally terrific.  As the movie opens, AgnesBrowne (Huston) is newly widowed with seven children.
The story follows the ups and downs of Agnes's life following the death of her husband.  There are tears, laughter, and romance.  And a great appearance by singer Tom Jones.  Highly recommended!  This is from the Mrs. Browne trilogy by Irish stand-up comic, Brendan O'Carroll (The Mammy, The Chisellers, and The Granny)Yes, you need tissues, but in the end it is totally uplifting.  It also made me want to book an Aer Lingus flight ASAP.",982368000,6,601,4.8431372549019605
1355872,3,B00004UB6S,"This bittersweet story focuses on the day-to-day lives of common folks in 1960's Ireland.  At the center of the story is its namesake, Agnes Browne (Anjelica Houston), who has just lost her husband and is struggling to support her seven children.  The film presents a slice-of-life of families struggling to stay afloat, but trivializes their plight by making its heroine's greatest ambition a trip to a Tom Jones concert.
While the story has some charming and poignant moments, it is mostly mundane and lacks the ability to keep all but the most sentimental viewer engaged.  It skims the surface of the lower middle class struggle to stay above the poverty line, but lacks the depth to draw us in.  Unlike ""Angela's Ashes"" which gives a gripping account of poverty and its human cost, this film just tries to bounce merrily along and make the best of things.  The humor was low brow and the Tom Jones ending was hokey in the extreme.
Two actors stand out, namely Anjelica Houston and Marion O'Dywer.  Houston carries the entire cast with a standout performance that is spontaneous and heartwarming.  O'Dwyer has a radiant smile and affability that makes her seem like she could be anyone's best bud.  The chemistry between the two was excellent.
Overall, this was a human-interest story that was very human, but not very interesting.  I rated it a 6/10.",973123200,,1354,4.852173913043479
1355873,5,B00004UB6S,"Having discovered Brendon OCarroll's The Mammy and The Chislers, I was delighted to hear the first book had been made into a movie with Angelica Huston.  This is a wonderful movie of a woman's learning to live after the death of her husband.  You suspect Agnes Brown has never asked too much of life, or her now departed husband.  She struggles to survive and to keep her family fed and together.  At her side are the seven children, the neighborhood and her dearest friend Marion.  The friendship between the two women is the heart of this film.  I was moved to tears as I watched the two of them laugh and cry, and cling to one another for support.  There is also a blosseming friendship/romance with a new resident of the neighborhood, and a truly terrifying resident in the form of the local small town loanshark.  Early in the film is one of the funniest funeral scenes I have ever witnessed, leaving me laughing out loud.  But the heart of this movie is the elegent Angelica Huston as Agnes and the bighearted Marion, played by Marion O'Dwyer.  Their friendship is the lynchpin of this film, and will make you want to call your best friend.",969926400,5,1146,4.546341463414634
