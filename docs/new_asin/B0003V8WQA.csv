8376032,5,B0003V8WQA,"This is a great collection of the first 13 years of Wrestle Maina. It's so much fun looking back at the earlier years. Wrestle Maina III is still the greatest of all time. I've had this set for over nine years now, and still think it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.

I would highly recomend buying this collection instead of the Wrestle Maina Anthology DVD set (or at least the first two sets of five) because unlike that collection, this one contains absolutely no editing. No editing of the logos, the music, or the ""WWF"" references. Each WM is shown as it originally aired on pay-per-view, except for Wrestle Mania XI, which is the ""Encore Plus"" version, but still has no editing. So if you're a true wrestling fan, forget those DVD's from the Anthology collection and start with this set. It's truly a must have.",1172016000,9,828,4.557046979865772
