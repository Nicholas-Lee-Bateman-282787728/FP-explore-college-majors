8451449,4,B0050MPUG2,"An enjoyable low-key, nice-paced romance movie.

It is well filmed (a quality transfer on DVD in anamorphic format) with an engaging story.  I like both of the main actors; Amrita Rao looks so good at this point in her career and her acting is great here (a little more outgoing than some earlier movies).

Seems like this movie is made by many of the same people who worked on ""Vivah"" (which is a great, innocent romance movie), and you can sense similar core values in the main characters of ""Love U...Mr. Kalakaar!"".  He is an artist with a humble/sincere life philosophy and she is a young office worker under a strict relative.
  (some scenes look like the same 'business building' lobby interior used in ""Jab We Met"" and ""Vivah"").

The music is fine/average (not a big part of the movie).

This is a nice movie to watch when you just want to relax without being too stressed by a complicated story or extreme action.",1344038400,2,922,4.579268292682927
