7799625,1,1592802486,"First of all this DVD is nothing more than a video taped seminar David was giving to a bunch of senior citizens back in 2000...he was still using fractional quotes (rather than decimal) and spoke of 2001 as a distant future. David Silverman who commented above must be a friend of Mr Nassar (or an Alias) to express that this was money well spent. Nassar's information was cursory at best, the format was very basic, I honestly did not walk away with one nugget of insight. For this video to be marketed as current (2005) and at this cost is insulting (but the only fool here is me because I got taken). Even the ""blue hairs"" in the audience were bored--he probably lured them in with free food and AsperCreme just to fill the room and give the impression that what he had to say was interesting. Perhaps David decided to sell this video because his trading has not been going very well.",1193443200,10,887,4.447852760736196
