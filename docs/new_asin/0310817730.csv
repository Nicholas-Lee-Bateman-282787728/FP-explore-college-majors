7788013,5,0310817730,A strikingly honest and frank comparison of our Christian faith to major world religions. Andy addresses many of the arguments we hear from skeptics and unbelievers but not in a stuffy classroom sort of way. Our church provided this through Right Now Media. Our various small groups went through all 8 of the 20 min. DVD presentations as the Pastors preached weekly messages that dovetailed with the DVD. I kept thinking of people I wish could see this so I'm buying the DVD to share with family and friends.,1509580800,,508,4.719101123595506
