8149261,3,B000J52L6W,"I think it would be great for a beginner shooter. It went through a lot of basics but, if you're looking for a little extra help to take your shooting to the next level I would try a different one. I hear dans video the secrets of the triangle is good.",1461715200,,252,3.9607843137254903

8149264,2,B000J52L6W,"The problem with this quite expensive instructional video is its incompleteness. To give a few examples of its deficiencies it does not mention eye dominance problems or deal with overhead driven shots or discuss gun mount etc. How can you have a video with this title which does not deal with incoming overhad shots or incoming flanking. I think his method could founder on these, particularly for example on simulated driven pheasant",1403827200,,435,5.055555555555555
8149265,5,B000J52L6W,"Very simple and complete.  I found this video very easy to understand.  The gun camera views were great..

8149266,4,B000J52L6W,"The DVD was made for sporting clays but I got a lot out of it for skeet.  The system makes sense and easy to apply to skeet.  I would recommend it, but wished he would have talked about skeet more.",1361491200,,197,3.9
