I have lost 2 inches in my waist and 2 inches in my hips, and 1 inch in my arms.  It's a great workout, gets the heart rate up, burns calories, burns fat, and tones at the same time.  Keep them coming ""Kresics"", I want your next video when it comes out.  ENJOYED WATCHING YOU ON FOX NEWS!!
Great News Report about the video and Kresics!!",1034985600,,505,4.423913043478261
8193967,2,B00005V6ET,"This would be a good video for beginners or senior citizens.  That is if they can stand listening to about 5 annoying phrases she repeats over and over and over throughout the video.  Pretty slow and boring........a very low budget video.
I bought it because I wanted a weight training video,
sorry........I didn't like it much",1028160000,,327,4.821428571428571
8193968,5,B00005V6ET,"I ordered this tape, as I wanted a totally different type of workout. This hit the spot.  I was tired of Denise Austin, and the like.  I thought it wouldn't be aerobic, but was pleasantly surprised.  And I use weights regularly, but felt this in my arms, and back.  Great.  This is just what I have been looking for.  I think this should be high up on your list of tapes, not at the bottom.  This will be a great success.  Thanks Kresics.",1015200000,,438,4.192771084337349
8193969,5,B00005V6ET,"This is not your traditional workout.  It's very unique and cleverly thought out by Kresics.  She's working your total body through slow gentle movements and hand weights in hand.  Like Tai Chi and Aerobics combined.  It's refreshing, it's fantastic!!  A cardiovascular and toning workout all in one.  The workout goes by quickly, because Kresics' personality is motivating and energizing.  A must tape to add to your collection.  Great Variety to your Fitness Program!!",1014076800,2,470,5.342465753424658
