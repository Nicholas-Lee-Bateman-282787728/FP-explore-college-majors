8237380,2,B001068GE0,"If you're like me an bought this primarily for the hidden easter egg of the classic Blind ""Video Days"" skateboard video, you're out of luck. The version I was sent - that I ordered from this listing here - is the ""special edition"" of What If and it does not contain the easter egg. This version has a blue cover also, not a red cover like what is pictured in this listing.",1363651200,,372,4.180555555555555
8237381,4,B001068GE0,"Decent skate video, but the extras are what really make this one necessary. A gallery of Blind graphics from their heyday in the early 90's, and most importantly, Blind's landmark video ""Video Days"" hidden away in it's entirety in the board gallery. You can buy the box set with this dvd & Video days, but why buy 2 when it's already here?",1251676800,,339,4.483870967741935
