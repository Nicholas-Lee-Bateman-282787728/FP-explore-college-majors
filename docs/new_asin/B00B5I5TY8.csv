8562944,2,B00B5I5TY8,"Scott Hahn is excellent. I have many of his books and tapes, however I was disappointed in this 6 CD set. I was expecting to get an in depth theological treatise on Hell and instead I got a lot of rehashed Scott Hahn teachings. I believe the word Hell is only used a few times throughout the entire 6 CD set.

CD 1, is theology of the body essentially and marriage. CD's 4 and 5 are good information about original sin with some references to how that affects our salvation etc. There is a good overview of the Protestant view of original sin (my favorite part of the CD's). CD 6 is all about Mary, chapter 12 of Revelation.

If you have never heard anything from Scott then I think you will find this very interesting and rewarding. If you have other of his books and CD's you will find this mostly a rehash of previous materials. I have several books in my library that treat the topic of Hell in a much more in depth manner.",1442275200,,927,4.231638418079096

8562946,3,B00B5I5TY8,"""What Every Catholic Needs to Know About Hell"" is an excellent video and I would give it 5 stars, but the quality of the video that I received was unplayable after 7:49 mins. and appears to be a very bad boot leg copy from www.casscommedia.com. While on Amazon the author is listed as Father William Casey, but the case does not refer to him or St. Joseph. While it is a bit cheaper on Amazon, I'm concerned of copyright issues and suggest paying a little more and get it from:  http://www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com/Home+Page/MULTIMEDIA/Apologetics/WHAT+EVERY+CATHOLIC+NEEDS+TO+KNOW+ABOUT+HELL-+DVD.axd

In short, God's teachings are meant to form us into the same type of person Jesus was.

Jesus is our role-model of perfect ""humanity"". However, due to our fallen human nature and our attraction to sinful choices, we cannot become like Christ in every way without his help--without the indwelling of His Holy Spirit.

Those of us who truly desire to be formed in Christ will embrace and absorb into our heart, mind and soul those things that are holy. What is holy? Those things that Jesus taught us are holy: God's Word; God's Spirit; God's Holy Flesh (the Eucharist).

If we do not desire to become like Christ in all ways, God will respect our decision when we die. But God, being a Being of justice, will not place those who are not formed in Christ with those who are. Otherwise, there would be tension and we have enough of that on earth. Heaven is a place of complete harmony and peace and if that is to exist, we must all be on the same moral ground as Jesus.

Simply put, the reason why Hell exists is because God knows if we do not want to live by all of His teachings and wisdom for the short time we are on earth, what makes us think we will want to live by them for all eternity? We won't. Again, God condemns no one to Hell, we condemn ourselves by choosing to reject God's wisdom. It is an ""all or nothing"" deal.

Those who want to live by God's teachings and wisdom for all eternity begin doing so on earth because they know it's what ultimate makes us the most happy (""great peace have they who love your laws..."" Psalm 119:165).

Those who strive to live by all of God's teachings discover the beauty and perfection of treating everyone like Christ did, and in turn, become like him in virtue and holiness. We still get to keep our personalities, but they become holy personalities.

It is not the will of God that any one of us should perish (2 Peter 3:9). But sadly, some will never make the sacrifices and commitment necessary to break away from the foolishness of this world and embrace the wisdom of our Creator, the manufacturer of our mind, body and souls. And who knows better than the manufacturer what makes us operate best?

This DVD will help everyone understand these very real truths...

Watch it closely. Then watch it again. They share with your family and friends....

in Christ,
Mark",1393286400,6,2348,4.44988344988345
