7864506,5,6304185553,There is quite a generation gap between myself and Mr. Stivender but his  youth as a catholic sounds alot like my own childhood. This was a very funny video. It is a must see for everyone especially if you were raised as a Catholic.,1160006400,,232,4.2727272727272725
7864507,5,6304185553,"Like Garrison Keillor, Ed Stivender has knack for storytelling that makes this video a pure pleasure to watch.  My wife's reaction attests that even if you're not Catholic, or never attended Catholic school, you'll truly enjoy this video.  An active Catholic, and a Catholic-school veteran, Stivender spins his tales of the first day of Catholic school, and the little girl schoolmate that he fell in love with (but could never tell her), in a way that we can all relate to.  If you attended Catholic school (as I did for 11 years) you will laugh yourself to tears as you watch and listen to Stivendor's personal stories, told in such a way that they will make your memories come racing back.  Stivender captures all of the awkward, sweet and hilarious childhood moments of growing up Catholic.  Worried about blasphemy?  Don't - the entire video is shot in a church in front of an audience of nuns and other Catholics ... who add to the hilarity with their laughter!",996019200,11,967,4.726190476190476
