8188632,4,B000P296DK,"Baseball is a game about numbers.  This 90 min. production by Major League Baseball presents 10 statistics that have been evaluated by 160 players as possibly unable to duplicate or excede. Hosted by a pre-PED-accused (not convicted) Roger Clemens. Each feat features video clips and sometimes interviews which are sometimes very insightful and include two United States Presidents. Some feature possible guesses as to a player possible to achieve the goal.

5714 Nolan Ryan strike outs (NO, nobody will pitch long enough and 5-man rotation instead of 4-man), Cal Ripken Jr. 2632 game streak (no, injury, luck, 17 seasons!), a suprise that Pete Rose's 4256 hits is mentioned as he is banned from baseball for life yet he is allowed to talk, good. (Doubtful), Cy Young 511 wins (NO, 5-man rotation instead of 4-man), Ted Williams hit .406 (possible, includes a 1985 interview, best pitching in the world mentioned), Bob Gibson 1.12 ERA in 1968 (doubtful due to decreased mound height and strike zone size reduced and who wants to see that?).

Rickey Henderson stolen bases in a season-130 and a career-1406(doubtful, body takes a beating), Eric Gagne 84 consecutive saves, possible, Yankees 5 consecutive World Series (doubtful, teams do not stay together that long, also, numerous rounds of play-off$), and Joe DiMaggio 56 game hit streak includes 1980 interview(possible).

Extras include three additional records with video. Interesting insightful. Hall of Famers and current players talk to emphasize the reality of the feats. A good gift for a baseball fan.",1386374400,,1561,5.232
8188633,5,B000P296DK,"This is a must for any baseball fan as it analyzes 10 ""unbreakable"" records, including Nolan Ryan's 5,714 strikouts, Eric Gagne's 84 consecutive saves, Cal Ripken's consecutive game streak, and Joe Dimaggio's cosecutive game hit streak, and ranks how the players rank them as the ""most unbreakble."" It features great commentaries from players and experts, and Roger Clemens does a great job hosting it. I loved it!",1384905600,,414,5.1940298507462686
8188634,4,B000P296DK,"Baseball records seem to hold more weight to me than the other sports I watch.  Tackling the subject of unbreakable records really interests me - its the things we always talked about as amateur viewers - what could be broken, who has a chance and what records will never be surpassed and why. Its great to see a video attempt to rank these records by difficulty to obtain - also gives a modern player prospective with interviews sharing their comments. Great video if you are a numbers baseball fan.",1331769600,,500,4.617977528089888

8188636,5,B000P296DK,"I know there are many shows about baseball records & feats, but this one is a pleasure to watch. It does not cover all records nor do I agree with all of it, but this show is addictive. It is well made and fun to watch. The production is top notch and the music great. I have watched it 3 times already and if the boys have it on when I get home, I would watch it over again. A must for any baseball fan and a great addition to my collection.",1240531200,3,442,3.8152173913043477
8188637,4,B000P296DK,"With lots of brief interviews, this video ably recaps why the feats herein rated are deemed 'unbreakable.' The ranking itself leans in favor of recent feats, which is understandable since only recent and current MLBers are interviewed, not historians or statisticians. Clemens serves as an amiable host.",1188172800,2,303,5.468085106382978
8188638,4,B000P296DK,"""Baseball's Most Unbreakable Feats"" looks at the ten most unbreakable feats in baseball as determined by a vote of players and managers.  There are career marks like Nolan Ryan's 5,714 strikeouts, Pete Rose's 4,256 hits, Cy Young's 511 wins, and Rickey Henderson's 1406 stolen bases. There are also streaks, from Cal Ripken, Jr.'s 2,632 consecutive games played and Eric Gagne's 84 consecutive saves to the New York Yankees winning five World Series in a row and Joe DiMaggio hitting safely in 56 games.  Finally, there are single season marks, with Ted Williams being the last to bat .400 in a season, Bob Gibson having an E.R.A. of 1.12, and Henderson stealing 130 bases in a single season.  Hosted by Roger Clemens, several dozen baseball players past and present share their thoughts on the achievement and the likelihood of it being unbreakable before the results are released to establish the order of the top 10.

While it is fun to see major leaguers ""do the math"" to explain why nobody is going to win 511 games, what I appreciated more were the attempts to explain why things have changed in the sport to make some of these records unbreakable (e.g., pitchers using the slide-step to keep base runners close, lowering the pitching mound).  The star quotient is a bit more on the players from the past, from Ted Williams and George Brett to Joe Garagiola and Bob Gibson, than it is for current stars in terms of the talking heads that pop up, but there are a few current stars (e.g., Johan Santana) and future Hall of Famers (e.g., Mike Piazza) who share their thoughts.

If you add up the percentage figures given for these 10 feats they add up to 211.  It seems that the players were asked to vote for three of the feats on the list they were presented with and there were more than 10 on that list.  Four honorable mentions are provided in the bonus features and they must have all gotten less than 5%, but there have to be more feats that do not even get mentioned, which is why it is so much fun for baseball fans to debate these sort of things.  Will anybody beat Rogers Hornsby's .424 single season batting average?  What about Ty Cobb's lifetime average of .367?  How about starting 51 games, finishing 48 of them and winning 41 of them like Jack Chesbro did?  Ed Walsh pitched 464 innings in a season, Bob Feller walked 208 batters in a season, and Pete Alexander had 16 shutouts.  Chief Wilson hit 36 triples in one year and Sam ""Wahoo"" Crawford had 309 triples for his career and 51 inside the park home runs.  Cy Young lost 316 games over his career.  Ty Cobb stole home 54 times, including 8 in one year.

The one thing baseball fans know before they watch this DVD is that they are probably not going to agree with these ten choices and they are definitely not going to agree with their final order (of these 10 it is those 511 wins by Cy Young that I would say is most unbeatable and it does not end up number 1).  With five-man rotations and middle relievers, set-up men, and relief specialists, a whole bunch of those career pitching marks are safe.  By the time you start looking over the possibilities I think what would be more interesting is not which of these records are unbreakable, but rather which ones might end up being broken.  On several of the feats covered, such as hitting two grand slams in one inning (not to mention hitting them off of the same pitcher), it could well be that no one will ever have the opportunity.  Another interesting part of this presentation is when players speculate on who might be able to bat .400, hit in 56 games in a row, or get to 4,256 hits (Ichiro and Derek Jeter get mentioned a lot).  But time and time again players crunch the numbers and point out if pitchers are not winning 30 games or striking out 300 batters multiple times that the likes of Young and Ryan are never going to be caught.",1186876800,13,3869,4.490727532097004
