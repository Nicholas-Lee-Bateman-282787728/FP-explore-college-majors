8208019,3,B000T76L1G,"Hook N Shoot ""Revolution: 3"" is the only Hook N Shoot ""Revolution"" DVD that I have seen, so I can't compare it to the previous volumes. Judging by what I have seen on this DVD, I'll say that there are four fights worth watching. Debi Purcell vs. Amber Mosley, Jan Finney vs. Ginele Marquez, Molly Helsel vs. Shawny Alvarado and Kellyn Heuhn vs. Victoria Remington. If you're just looking for blood and brutal knockouts then I wouldn't recommend this DVD for you. The fighters in this DVD are more technical and they mostly use submissions.",1209427200,7,539,4.684210526315789
