8179266,5,B0007GP7DC,"I traveled to West Africa this past year, and saw this movie for the first time while I was living there.  Cinematography is gorgeous in this movie and I love the way the classic 'Carmen' storyline is adapted to West African (specifically Senegalese) culture. The main actress who plays Karmen makes this movie extra wonderful- she is absolutely beautiful and a stunning actress.  If you love foreign films, and want to try out something new, watch Karmen Gei!",1369094400,,460,4.884615384615385
8179267,4,B0007GP7DC,"This is a Senegalese remake of Bizet's opera Carmen, set in the seedy underworld of contemporary Dakar. A good point of reference might be Black Orpheus, although this film is more overtly political and challenging. The music and dance are fantastic, and well integrated into the action; it actually makes sense when these characters burst into song. And the background score is provided by the great jazz composer and saxophonist David Murray. Djeinaba Diop Ga, the actress in the title role, is a force of nature. This gets only four stars for some spotty dialog and a few awkward holes in the script, but overall it's well worth watching and a great introduction to African cinema.",1218067200,3,684,4.905172413793103
8179268,5,B0007GP7DC,"I loved this!  The first thing that grabbed my attention was the stunning Amazonian beauty of Karman. The second was the very sexy seduction between she and her beautiful female jailer...  The movie had moving music, bold, bright colors, lovely scenery, and an interesting story.  Yes, Karman was dangerous - the kind of dangerous you can't keep away from!  She made me want to dance, sing, love, and LIVE!",1168387200,9,406,4.840579710144928
