8215909,1,B000UZTT98,I cannot believe Criterion did this movie. One of the worst movies of all time,1434844800,,78,4.266666666666667
8215910,5,B000UZTT98,Excellent movie.  Fernando Reyis superb.,1428624000,2,40,7.0
8215911,1,B000UZTT98,"I had high hopes for this movie because of it pedigree. Unfortunately it's milk toast approach to the adult themes it purports to embrace are shot like a ""G"" movie.",1424217600,,164,4.5
8215912,5,B000UZTT98,"It's worth getting the blu-ray instead of the out-of-print Criterion DVD because of the much better picture (the Criterion DVD had a disappointing picture) and extras, though I hate the menus on this blu-ray.  There's cheesy music playing during the menu that isn't even from the film.  Aesthetically, the Criterion DVD is better as far as the packaging and menus go.  This blu-ray wins because of the picture.  The bonus interviews are excellent as well.",1390694400,20,455,5.026666666666666
8215913,4,B000UZTT98,"""That Obscure Object of Desire"" (1977) was the last movie Luis Bunuel directed, and it's a good one with Bunuel using two actresses to play the same female character. The transfer is crystal clear, and was apparently remastered by Studio Canal/Lionsgate. There are lots of extras, including interviews with Jean-Claude Carriere, Carlos Saura, a 37 minute ""Lady Doubles"" feature that has interviews with Carole Bouquet, and Angela Molina, as well as a 17 minute feature about Luis Bunuel"" directed by Dominique Maillet.",1387670400,,518,5.329268292682927
8215914,5,B000UZTT98,"For me, this movie is about the inability of men and women to understand one another, and especially how mysterious and capricious women seem to some men.  I believe the lead actress switches back and forth to demonstrate just how unknowable this woman is for Fernando Rey, so unknowable that she is an entirely different woman from scene to scene and day to day.  One of Bunuel's finest efforts.",1384041600,6,396,4.72463768115942
8215915,4,B000UZTT98,"Yes, there is no other reason to watch this flick unless you are into Bond chick's and this one gives you what Bond's movies dont--some skin of future celebrities. The movie itself, however, kinda strange as most of Frenchies and lost in what the message is or should be. My understanding also, this flick is the only copy that is not cut in pieces. Recommended.",1362355200,2,362,4.584615384615384
