183228,1,1562196308,"I bought this one thinking that, since the video game was of unusualy high quality for a fighter, that the anime would be pretty good, and since that it was directed by Masami Obari (The writer of the heavy weight Fatal Fury series), that it would be awesome.  Alas. I brought it home, and my hopes of a good anime were shot to hell within minutes.  SERIOUSLY.  The logic used in making this one reminds me of something a bunch of five year olds would make.  Now, normally, I'm very lineant with the artwork and animation quality of an anime, for I know that not everything can equal up to Akira and Macross Plus in terms of quality, and Toshinden can almost pass my quality chart.  The animation isn't bad.  The story has a very B movie feel to it, and the dubbing is horrid.  The fights are short and consist mostly of the characters flopping around.  Any attempts to be dramatic simply doesn't work in this film.  Some of the main gripes are with dubbing, but even with a better dub job or with subtitles, nothing is really gained, for the storyline is still bad.  The writer of the anime determines how I judge them.  If you like Obari's style, then go with the Fatal Fury box set.  However, if you just don't like yourself at all, and want to hurt yourself, then buy Toshinden. Trust me, you'll get more entertainment out of taking the Toshinden characters and writing your own fanfic.  The story is the most unforgiving part of this anime though.  It was made to gain a quick buck by the success of the game.  Don't waste your money.  But, I know that some of you out there don't really care about the negative reviews, and just want the anime in your hands, and if that's you, then don't cry once you watch this.",978393600,4,1719,4.375394321766562

i don't get it many people thought the movie stinks contains mild nudity and violence.",977875200,,314,4.589285714285714
183230,3,1562196308,"This movie is not one of the best anime movies around. It does not have  that great of a story line, but since it is based on a fighting game (which  don't really have to much of a story line anyway) it can not be helped. The  fighting sequences are short and defenitly nothing speecial. The movie  itself is totally predictable and all of the characters survie anyway.",968025600,3,369,4.382352941176471
183231,1,1562196308,"Why do I even bother? Battle Arena Toshinden is yet another (say it with me now) pointless fighting-game anime that has no veritable purpose other than to increase the number of pointless fighting-game anime in an already  crowded genre.
  Just one reason not to watch Battle Arena Toshinden...  Like most other anime of its ilk, Toshinden doesn't have much in the way of  plot or character development. The plot is so painfully derivative that it  barely merits mentioning. A group of bad guys known as ""the  Organization"" decide to make some sort of super android, so they send  out prototypes to battle the world's greatest warriors and learn their  fighting techniques. Naturally, the world's greatest warriors are the  Toshinden fighters. Now, this wouldn't be quite so bad if the Toshinden  group were at least a mildly interesting group. However, they're either  strictly one-dimentional or tossed into the anime solely for the purpose of  a few pointless battle scenes. Oh, and that ""mysterious, long-lost  brother"" cliche just has got to go.
From there on in we get to the  action, which could have been this title's saving grace. However, as far as  martial arts stuff goes, this title is pure garbage. The battle scenes are  just plain ridiculous, usually just involving the characters executing  incredibly silly-looking (and poorly drawn) special attacks, most of which  involve enough spinning to make me nauseous. And it certainly didn't help  listening to the English voice actors crying out the attack names in  Japanese. Ick.
  ... and here's another.  As far as production values go  there isn't much to say. The art and animation weren't overly spectacular,  and there is a noticeable lack of artistic detail. The voice-acting was  just plain poor, and the dialog equally repugnant (the line, ""I guess  I'm not much of an actor"" has got to be heard to be  believed).
Ultimately, Toshinden is another another anime headed for the  turkey bin. As far as fighting-game anime go, anything else looks golden  (even Tekken, much as it pains me to say it). Don't waste your time nor  money.",959558400,6,2103,4.988439306358382
183232,1,1562196308,"This movie is one of the worst video game to anime translations that I've ever seen.  The fight scences were poorily done, the character designs were beyond ugly, the story was played out, the dialogue was tired, and the most  important thing of all THIS MOVIE DOESN'T DO THE VIDEO GAME ANY JUSTICE.",944524800,5,299,4.622641509433962

7796267,3,1562196308,"It was fun. It was sound. And short.

The plot: A modernized Ryu and Ken (Eiji and Kayin) with swords and motorcycles with his group of participating rivals/fighters meet-up again after the first Battle Arena Tournament. The Lone-Swordsman Eiji would then meet-up with his secluded girlfriend, Sofia, with no memory of her past in order to protect her in an old-fashioned sense.

Pros:
- this movie attempts to animate the character's special attacks/movelist in the game.
- decent sound effects
- Preserves the character relations within the game perfectly.

Cons:
- Only 60 mins
- ending is a cut-off
- bad drawing

Basically, if you could re-model every Street-Fighter character within the series and gave them a fighting-weapon instead of hand-to-hand combat, you would have this.

Rating - I'd give it 3-stars out of 5.

That's because I feel that the conversion of a video-game to a movie/anime is always flawed. This one is no exception. This movie seems to portray the Battle Arena Toshinden in a much-more lighter tone than the game. If you play the game, you'll notice that the theme is so much darker than the one you see here. Everyone is so uptight within the game and when you get to this, it's too cheesy... You would never hear some of the stuff Eiji said in the movie compared to the game, but it was nice and fun to hear him have an actual attitude rather than say: Ryu from Street-Fighter.

Overall, it was alright~ could have been much-better if these people really put-forth their efforts. I liked the storyline because I feel that it's unique within its own perspective and not just another clone of Street-Fighter or Tekken. I would say the storyline is original. It could go far. I do like the characters and the setting.

Conclusion: If you haven't played the game before, you probably won't understand it.",1360022400,,1831,4.79047619047619
7796268,1,1562196308,"I have watched a lot of anime in my day and this is easily the worst I've ever seen. Bad animation, terrible story writing, bad voice-acting, no depth, no character development. Please trust me on this one and don't bother watching it. This is on par with the legend of zelda animated series, which was pretty terrible.",1343001600,2,319,4.614035087719298

7796270,5,1562196308,"When this movie came on the Action Channel. I never got to see it. I have been waiting for it to come back, but it never did. It wasn't very long until I bought the movie on DVD. I learned that this movie was the very first DVD the Centeral Park Media aka (U.S. Manga Corps) first released. It was really cool when I watched the entire movie, it was just like the video game with all the cool characters. My favorite characters are: Eiji, Sofia, Ellis, Fo, and Duke. The movie also features the voices of Hideo Seaver, Ted Lewis and Lisa Ortiz famous for Yu-Gi-Oh!, Chris Yates, Greg Wolfe, Carter Cathcart famous for Grappler Baki. This is the best anime to see go buy it.",1125360000,,673,4.307086614173229
7796271,5,1562196308,"This film kicks butt!!!! The only problems is: most of the scenes are just violence, and you know how Duke kicked some major attitude in the game? He pops up on only one scene and says only one line. Chaos SUCKED LIKE CRAZY!!!! He's truly the dumbest character in BAT next to Uranus. Kayin sure was cool. The first time I played the game I thought he was a bad guy, but I was wrong. Eiji, too, brought back memories. Ellis,however, is my favorite character but she didn't join in almost any fight and she almost died just because of poison, and I mean the poison seemed harmless to anyone!",1110153600,,589,4.363636363636363
7796272,5,1562196308,"Battle Arena Toshinden is based off the short lived Fighting game that was here in America (and was part of the Playstation opening lineup).  In the Anime it is about Eiji searching out his brother SHo.  In the Meantime the Organization (Run by Uranus) is trying to gather Data on the Toshinden Warriors in order to create the ultimate killing machine.  To battle the ORganization Eiji, Kayin, Sofia, Tracey and Gaia all team up to take the organization down after they attack and put in the hoispital Ellis.
The fight sequences are typcial Anime but still real cool to watch (if you are into Action Anime).  It fits right in if you are a Fan of Street Fighter, Tekken, or Fatal Fury.  IT will not appeal to everyone because it is more about the fights than plot but than again most bond films are the same way and no one complains.  THis is a decent anime that is worth watching at least once (or owning like I do).",1057795200,,916,4.4226190476190474
7796273,5,1562196308,"I think this movie is one of the best the music is great along with the battles. It has all the characters except Master and you only get a quick glimps of Vermillion all in all it is well worth it. The movie is about a Master Swordsman Eiji Shinjo that has been haunted by the memory of his battle with the renegade champion,Gaia- But now, a mysterious warrior is hunting down the champions of the previous tournament and the person hunting them may be Sho Shinjo (Eiji's brother). Who is this powerful, new foe and who is his next target? Eiji and Kayin-his greatest rival and closest friend- struggle to unravel the mystery before they too, join the ranks of the defeated. At last, the ultimate battle between the greatest fighters in the world will be decided. And the price of victory may be to great....",1016064000,7,809,4.510204081632653
7796274,3,1562196308,"Done by Masami Obari, the man behind Fatal Fury, Battle Arena Toshinden is yet another fighting game-based anime. The action scenes are okay as usual with Obari's work, and the dub is, well, what you'd expect from a dub. The story was flat out average, although I do admit there were a few good parts. On the minus side, the climax was pretty generic and turned out to be disappointing. The uncut version features a nice scene with Sofia in the shower, but shoddy artwork ruins it. Uh, anyway, despite those flaws, Toshinden is an above average fighting anime. If you're into action anime or Obari's work, then buy it, if you can't see it first.",992908800,3,645,4.568965517241379
