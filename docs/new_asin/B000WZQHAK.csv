2993128,5,B000WZQHAK,"This movie is a gem. It's a comedy/drama which exposes the financial realities of cattle ranching vs. sheep ranching. Naturally it was a hard movie to market.
  Set in the land wars of the west the movie starts out light and whimsical as a quixotic sheep rancher stubbornly decides to buck the trend. His fall and fight for principals of right and wrong make for a great movie.",1244332800,23,377,4.529411764705882

2993138,4,B000WZQHAK,"This is one of my favorites among the Glenn Ford westerns, as it is a good mix of typical western cowboy movies, action, humor and some tragedy.  It is a tale of a traditional cowboy who decides to get into the sheep-raising business - in cattle country.  Naturally, Ford realizes that in that environment, where sheep men are not only unwelcome, but they are misunderstood, mistreated, and hated.  Ford must initially show his courage in several entertaining ways, but with some tragic outcomes.  This is a film that will hold your interest for sure, and is a good buy.",1483315200,2,570,4.7272727272727275

Warner Brothers, MGM and Universal are all using these cheap cases to sell you their archived classics.

When you open the case you're immediately hit by a strong, sweet, pungent and (more than likely) brain damaging odor. Then, after you set the movie aside for a week or more, the case begins to warp and expand opening up and releasing that brain-cell killing odor into your home. Luckily, I had some extra old empty DVD cases lying around so I was able to replace it.

This one is a so-so DVD in terms of the quality of the transfer, and it deserves much better.  Filmed in part in Western Colorado in autumn, the original must have been eye-popping.  It is fun (like Indiana Jones, a blend of funny and action and a shake of drama), has good characters, and is engaging.

Plot: a Texans comes to Wyoming with a train full of sheep, intent on raising them in cattle country.  He runs into an old and smarmy acquaintance (played by Leslie Neilson) and wins over a local dame (Shirley McClain), on whom Neilson's character has romantic plans.

He soon discovers that Jumbo is employed by the biggest man in the valley, Col. Steven Bedford (Leslie Nielsen)--whom he knew in Texas as Johnny Bledsoe, and once came very close to having a gunfight with.  Bedford/Bledsoe is a successful cattleman now, engaged to Dell, and like his neighbors he doesn't want sheep anywhere near.  When Jason and Milt foil the cattlemen's attempt to peacefully deport the sheep, Bedford brings in a gunman named Choctaw Neill (Pernell Roberts) who has something of a grudge against Jason: he killed Jason's fiancee in a bank robbery, and Jason spent the next several years hounding him, though he never quite caught up.

Directed by George Marshall

Jason Sweet (Glenn Ford) is a remarkable self-assured though hard-bitten sheep farmer who is running up against the opposition of the town and cattle ranchers. Enters Dell Payton (Shirley MacLaine, a no-nonsense frontier girl who becomes the bone of contention between Sweet and cattle baron Col. Stephen Bedford (Leslie Nielsen). Meanwhile, Sweet `s standing in the town rises when he manages to humiliate Bedford's top gun Jumbo McCall (Mickey Shaughnessy) in public. This brooding range war crystallizes when Sweet & Bedford go one-on-one in this exciting western (possessed of several light-hearted moments).

Mickey Shaughnessy is Nielson's right hand man, who can't seem to get the better of Ford when he comes to town. Mickey is a scene stealer, probably one of his best roles.  This flick is just about as fun and light hearted as it gets with good action packed gunplay.

2993208,5,B000WZQHAK,"Although he never received an academy award -- or even a nomination -- Glenn Ford was was of the most consistently outstanding actors of the Golden Age of movies. Somehow he excelled at everything from action and adventure movies to romance and comedy, and he was one of the very best western stars. His versatility made him just right for this unusual western which combines romance and comedy with action and adventure. This is one of my half dozen favorite westerns -- ahead of many which are far more famous. Highly recommended.",1315526400,3,532,4.793478260869565

2993211,5,B000WZQHAK,"This unconventional 1958 western staring a funny Glenn Ford and Shirley MacLain and a serious Leslie Nielson as the villain is filled with humor and satire. Glenn Ford comes to a town in the midst of cattle country and immediately shows how clever he is by taking advantage of everyone and making clever remarks. He starts a fight with the strongest man in town to show that he is stronger and unafraid of everyone and to demonstrate that no one should bother him even though he intends to bring sheep into the cattle country. He soon finds out that the man that is considered the head man of the town, a man determined to get rid of the sheep, is a man he knew back in Texas, a man he almost had a shootout with, Leslie Nielson, a man who changed his name and became quite rich and is now engaged to Shirley MacLain. The film is fun to watch and it is fun to see how he outwits people opposed to him and takes the girl from her fianc, Nielson.",1308009600,11,944,4.220994475138122
2993212,4,B000WZQHAK,"If you get sentimental about Glenn Ford movies, you'll like this one. It is refreshingly funny - he isn't always, but Shirley MacLaine's comic shtick and overt avoidance of Ford's womanizing Jason Sweet gives the story a rom-com twist. Sheepmen, as history bears out, were anathema to cowboys and cattle owners. Needless to say, once Sweet rides his unflappable self into town, his trouble with locals begins. Leslie Nielson plays Ford's double-dealing nemesis, and affords one with a rare look at his earlier, more serious self. Nobody is serious for too long, however, as the likes of Slim Pickens and other Western character actors do their part to make the film amusing. There is an ironic twist at the end when Sweet is all done with his bovine conflicts.

On the negative side, it has low-budget and obvious background scenes, especially noticeable when Ford and MacLaine are riding together. This wasn't unusual for the time period, but may be particularly disagreeable to younger viewers. The humor doesn't quite rise to the level of Cat Ballou, but you can see where Westerns started to trend in this '58 film.
In short, The Sheepman is better than OK, but not fantastic.",1303516800,7,1180,4.9296482412060305
2993213,4,B000WZQHAK,"Its hard to go wrong with Glenn Ford, and this is one of many examples of a fairly pedestrian plot elevated by his screen presence. Here Ford shows up in a cattle town with sheep, and immediately sets out to prove that he is not to be messed with. When he discovers an old (sometimes) friend and (sometimes) nemesis (Leslie Neilsen) essentially runs the place as the town's most successful cattle baron, the scene is set for a fairly predictable series of confrontations.

I mentioned in my title that the film is somewhat confused. At times it seems that it wants to try to be a comedy, at other times is seems to want to be a straight cowboy drama. Many of Ford's outrageous series of tactics throughout the film are truly amusing. However, many scenes involving the sheep/cattle tension are deadly serious. This was exacerbated by the presence of Shirley McClain, who was generally at her best in light comedic roles. Here she mainly comes across as confused, as it seems she can't decide between the already present Neilsen, or the flamboyant newcomer Ford.

My criticisms aside, a fan of basic westerns will enjoy this movie. It has all the classic western elements, and it has Glenn Ford!",1303344000,4,1194,4.708133971291866

2993216,5,B000WZQHAK,"This 1958 comedy western stars Glenn Ford and Shirley MacLaine.  There are a lot of funny moments in this film.  In one scene, Ford tells Edgar Buchanan that he is looking for a man who is completely without honor, a man who is willing to sell out anybody and everybody for as little as fifty cents.  Buchanan tries to look offended but when Ford starts to walk away, Buchanan says, ""My price for that sort of thing starts at least a dollar.""

The story is pretty familiar to western fans but the first 15 minutes are full of surprises. (Do not read the back of the DVD case or you will spoil the surprise.) The chemistry between Ford and MacLaine is delightful. The photography in this film is beautiful and the musical score is both tender and heartwarming.

I recall seeing the original eons ago at a theater. Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLaine, Leslie Nielsen, Mickey Shaughnessy, Edgar Buchanan, Pernell Roberts, Slim Pickens, what more could one ask of a cast for a western? Up until Warner Brother's decided to publish its long list of winning films, The Sheepman was only available in a European Format which if it worked at all on a USA DVD player would not be of the best quality

Powder Valley is a cattle town, with a capital C. In rides Jason Sweet (Ford) on the train, with an attitude and a load of sheep quickly to follow. However, his decision to run a herd of sheep in cattle country IS a bit more than just an attitude in a town like Powder Valley. Just to make sure his point is clear enough, Sweet goes far out of his way to provoke everyone in town, including a young and foxy Dale (Shirley MacLaine at the height of her beauty). The cattle crowd led by Colonel Stephen Bedford and Dale's father, both large cattle holders which are not very happy about Sweet's idea of driving sheep into the valley.

Sweet pushes every button he can to let everyone know he has not come to town to win a popularity contest, (noted by Buchanan's character). All of Sweet's moves are accomplished with a sharp supply of acidic, sarcastic, humor, including his  picking a fight with Shaughnessy's character. He then displays  an incredible quick draw and shoot trick with sardonically humorous aplomb letting all and sundry know of his deadly intentions.

Mickey Shaughnessy, is perfect with his usual bumbling, not so-bright characterization of a tough guy, who is a bit slow on the uptake. Leslie Nielsen as the Colonel, shows his often dark side, created long before his buffoonish character's in later life. Conversely Buchanan, sheds his sometimes devious criminal side with humor and loyalty. Pickens is the sheriff who goes off fishing at the slightest hint of legal trouble and the whole cast is excellent.

Turns out the Colonel, who Sweet knows as Johnny, is an old acquaintance. Johnny/The Colonel, has Sweet hijacked to a meeting and it becomes apparent that Sweet is on some sort of vengeance crusade against the Colonel,  or one of his associates. There are a few other twists and turns, among which that Sweet and Dale have eyes for each other despite her engagement to the Colonel, so Sweet tells her that he is after the man who, seven years before, killed Sweet's fiancee'. The Colonel, it is soon discovered, has been indulging in secret land grabbing of the open ranges, which leads to Dale breaking off her engagement and siding in with Sweet and her father to pull away from support of the Colonel.

Overall, it is one of Ford's best comedic westerns, wise cracking and slugging and shooting his way along to the climax, a series of gunfights, one in which  he is up against impossible odds facing the man who killed his fiancee'. I will say no more either about the plot nor the ending, because I do not want to spoil the final resolutions for you.

The DVD was fine and crisp, clear and without hitches. I only found one problem with the film, and that was the price of $26.95 or $24.95 at Amazon. One can buy an album of similar films for the same price or a bit more. I bought my copy for $18.99 through an Amazon Associate. Warner and some others in this era of depression/inflation are pushing the DVD price envelope. There are few movies I would pay more than $7.50 for and this was one of them.

As for content, for its genre' I give it 5 stars.",1282176000,4,3653,4.764240506329114
2993220,5,B000WZQHAK,"Hooray for someone finally putting this one out on DVD. I've searched for it for years, ever hopeful. Together with The Cowboy and The Rounders, it's one of the best vehicles by Ford. Of course there are others, like 3:10 to Yuma, but these three have been long neglected in presentations of his best works. Perhaps Ford's death last year prompted release. Whatever the reason, I'm very glad.",1268784000,2,392,4.779411764705882

Plot: a Texans comes to Wyoming with a train full of sheep, intent on raising them in cattle country.  He runs into an old and smarmy acquaintance (played by Leslie Neilson) and wins over a local dame (Shirley McClain), on whom Neilson's character has romantic plans.

Directed by George Marshall

Jason Sweet (Glenn Ford) is a remarkable self-assured though hard-bitten sheep farmer who is running up against the opposition of the town and cattle ranchers. Enters Dell Payton (Shirley MacLaine, a no-nonsense frontier girl who becomes the bone of contention between Sweet and cattle baron Col. Stephen Bedford (Leslie Nielsen). Meanwhile, Sweet `s standing in the town rises when he manages to humiliate Bedford's top gun Jumbo McCall (Mickey Shaughnessy) in public. This brooding range war crystallizes when Sweet & Bedford go one-on-one in this exciting western (possessed of several light-hearted moments).

Mickey Shaughnessy is Nielson's right hand man, who can't seem to get the better of Ford when he comes to town. Mickey is a scene stealer, probably one of his best roles.  This flick is just about as fun and light hearted as it gets with good action packed gunplay.

3227705,5,B000WZQHAK,"Although he never received an academy award -- or even a nomination -- Glenn Ford was was of the most consistently outstanding actors of the Golden Age of movies. Somehow he excelled at everything from action and adventure movies to romance and comedy, and he was one of the very best western stars. His versatility made him just right for this unusual western which combines romance and comedy with action and adventure.

3227708,5,B000WZQHAK,"This unconventional 1958 western staring a funny Glenn Ford and Shirley MacLain and a serious Leslie Nielson as the villain is filled with humor and satire. Glenn Ford comes to a town in the midst of cattle country and immediately shows how clever he is by taking advantage of everyone and making clever remarks. He starts a fight with the strongest man in town to show that he is stronger and unafraid of everyone and to demonstrate that no one should bother him even though he intends to bring sheep into the cattle country. He soon finds out that the man that is considered the head man of the town, a man determined to get rid of the sheep, is a man he knew back in Texas, a man he almost had a shootout with, Leslie Nielson, a man who changed his name and became quite rich and is now engaged to Shirley MacLain. The film is fun to watch and it is fun to see how he outwits people opposed to him and takes the girl from her fianc, Nielson.",1308009600,11,944,4.220994475138122
3227709,4,B000WZQHAK,"If you get sentimental about Glenn Ford movies, you'll like this one. It is refreshingly funny - he isn't always, but Shirley MacLaine's comic shtick and overt avoidance of Ford's womanizing Jason Sweet gives the story a rom-com twist. Sheepmen, as history bears out, were anathema to cowboys and cattle owners. Needless to say, once Sweet rides his unflappable self into town, his trouble with locals begins. Leslie Nielson plays Ford's double-dealing nemesis, and affords one with a rare look at his earlier, more serious self. Nobody is serious for too long, however, as the likes of Slim Pickens and other Western character actors do their part to make the film amusing. There is an ironic twist at the end when Sweet is all done with his bovine conflicts.

On the negative side, it has low-budget and obvious background scenes, especially noticeable when Ford and MacLaine are riding together. This wasn't unusual for the time period, but may be particularly disagreeable to younger viewers. The humor doesn't quite rise to the level of Cat Ballou, but you can see where Westerns started to trend in this '58 film.
In short, The Sheepman is better than OK, but not fantastic.",1303516800,7,1180,4.9296482412060305
3227710,4,B000WZQHAK,"Its hard to go wrong with Glenn Ford, and this is one of many examples of a fairly pedestrian plot elevated by his screen presence. Here Ford shows up in a cattle town with sheep, and immediately sets out to prove that he is not to be messed with. When he discovers an old (sometimes) friend and (sometimes) nemesis (Leslie Neilsen) essentially runs the place as the town's most successful cattle baron, the scene is set for a fairly predictable series of confrontations.

I mentioned in my title that the film is somewhat confused. At times it seems that it wants to try to be a comedy, at other times is seems to want to be a straight cowboy drama. Many of Ford's outrageous series of tactics throughout the film are truly amusing. However, many scenes involving the sheep/cattle tension are deadly serious. This was exacerbated by the presence of Shirley McClain, who was generally at her best in light comedic roles. Here she mainly comes across as confused, as it seems she can't decide between the already present Neilsen, or the flamboyant newcomer Ford.

My criticisms aside, a fan of basic westerns will enjoy this movie. It has all the classic western elements, and it has Glenn Ford!",1303344000,4,1194,4.708133971291866

3227713,5,B000WZQHAK,"This 1958 comedy western stars Glenn Ford and Shirley MacLaine.  There are a lot of funny moments in this film.  In one scene, Ford tells Edgar Buchanan that he is looking for a man who is completely without honor, a man who is willing to sell out anybody and everybody for as little as fifty cents.  Buchanan tries to look offended but when Ford starts to walk away, Buchanan says, ""My price for that sort of thing starts at least a dollar.""

The story is pretty familiar to western fans but the first 15 minutes are full of surprises. (Do not read the back of the DVD case or you will spoil the surprise.) The chemistry between Ford and MacLaine is delightful. The photography in this film is beautiful and the musical score is both tender and heartwarming.

I recall seeing the original eons ago at a theater. Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLaine, Leslie Nielsen, Mickey Shaughnessy, Edgar Buchanan, Pernell Roberts, Slim Pickens, what more could one ask of a cast for a western? Up until Warner Brother's decided to publish its long list of winning films, The Sheepman was only available in a European Format which if it worked at all on a USA DVD player would not be of the best quality

Powder Valley is a cattle town, with a capital C. In rides Jason Sweet (Ford) on the train, with an attitude and a load of sheep quickly to follow. However, his decision to run a herd of sheep in cattle country IS a bit more than just an attitude in a town like Powder Valley. Just to make sure his point is clear enough, Sweet goes far out of his way to provoke everyone in town, including a young and foxy Dale (Shirley MacLaine at the height of her beauty). The cattle crowd led by Colonel Stephen Bedford and Dale's father, both large cattle holders which are not very happy about Sweet's idea of driving sheep into the valley.

Sweet pushes every button he can to let everyone know he has not come to town to win a popularity contest, (noted by Buchanan's character). All of Sweet's moves are accomplished with a sharp supply of acidic, sarcastic, humor, including his  picking a fight with Shaughnessy's character. He then displays  an incredible quick draw and shoot trick with sardonically humorous aplomb letting all and sundry know of his deadly intentions.

Mickey Shaughnessy, is perfect with his usual bumbling, not so-bright characterization of a tough guy, who is a bit slow on the uptake. Leslie Nielsen as the Colonel, shows his often dark side, created long before his buffoonish character's in later life. Conversely Buchanan, sheds his sometimes devious criminal side with humor and loyalty. Pickens is the sheriff who goes off fishing at the slightest hint of legal trouble and the whole cast is excellent.

Turns out the Colonel, who Sweet knows as Johnny, is an old acquaintance. Johnny/The Colonel, has Sweet hijacked to a meeting and it becomes apparent that Sweet is on some sort of vengeance crusade against the Colonel,  or one of his associates. There are a few other twists and turns, among which that Sweet and Dale have eyes for each other despite her engagement to the Colonel, so Sweet tells her that he is after the man who, seven years before, killed Sweet's fiancee'. The Colonel, it is soon discovered, has been indulging in secret land grabbing of the open ranges, which leads to Dale breaking off her engagement and siding in with Sweet and her father to pull away from support of the Colonel.

Overall, it is one of Ford's best comedic westerns, wise cracking and slugging and shooting his way along to the climax, a series of gunfights, one in which  he is up against impossible odds facing the man who killed his fiancee'. I will say no more either about the plot nor the ending, because I do not want to spoil the final resolutions for you.

The DVD was fine and crisp, clear and without hitches. I only found one problem with the film, and that was the price of $26.95 or $24.95 at Amazon. One can buy an album of similar films for the same price or a bit more. I bought my copy for $18.99 through an Amazon Associate. Warner and some others in this era of depression/inflation are pushing the DVD price envelope. There are few movies I would pay more than $7.50 for and this was one of them.

As for content, for its genre' I give it 5 stars.",1282176000,4,3653,4.764240506329114
3227717,5,B000WZQHAK,"Hooray for someone finally putting this one out on DVD. I've searched for it for years, ever hopeful. Together with The Cowboy and The Rounders, it's one of the best vehicles by Ford. Of course there are others, like 3:10 to Yuma, but these three have been long neglected in presentations of his best works. Perhaps Ford's death last year prompted release. Whatever the reason, I'm very glad.",1268784000,2,392,4.779411764705882
