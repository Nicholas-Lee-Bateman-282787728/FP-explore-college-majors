8380979,5,B002U51FVG,"I learned a great deal from watching this DVD. And I so appreciated the statistics and graphs explaining how we'd gotten so fat over the years. Jeff doesn't mince words and I've watched this one over and over again because he presents so much information. Lately, I've taken to getting copies and giving them away. Great job Jeff, you did it once again!!",1415836800,2,354,4.634920634920635

8380981,2,B002U51FVG,"OK, this is a rant, so forgive me if my review isn't a cohesive composition.  I bought my DVD at Whole Foods last weekend.  The first part of the video is a guy giving a PowerPoint presentation on the obesity trends in the US over the last 35 years or so.  It is good because it debunks some myths about diets.  In the end, he just tells you what you've already known in your heart--it's all about calories and calorie density.  That is, a tablespoon of butter has way more calories than 4 cups of spinach.  Eat more vegetables and fruits!  Eat fewer calories over all!  I already know this.  My problem is that eating fewer calories is hard to do.  It is particularly hard to turn down all the goodies at work!  Anyway, I started writing this review about 3 minutes into the second part of the video, because I was really disappointed to find that this DVD is simply a sales pitch to sign up for the McDougal Program someplace in CA, some kind of destination weight loss place for people who all looked very unhealthy to me (fat and old looking). I can't afford to go to CA. I can't even afford weight watchers. That is why I paid $20 for a DVD that I thought would teach me how to lose weight (how to prepare quick, easy, low-calorie meals; how to avoid temptation; etc.).  Overall, I'm disappointed that I paid $20 for a DVD of information that I could have gotten on a weekend afternoon watching PBS. (Please forgive any tie pose! ;->.)",1394236800,6,1440,4.352059925093633

8380983,3,B002U51FVG,"Anyone looking for info on the obesity epidemic would find this quite informative, but I was looking for more information on product labels.  Unfortunately this did not cover it as I was led to believe.",1278028800,4,202,4.771428571428571
