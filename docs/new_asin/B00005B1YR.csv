1419740,5,B00005B1YR,"This DVD was interesting; although some of the info was ""duplicated"" in two other DVDs I purchased.  The story of Pearl Harbor will continue to be debated for a LONG time to come.  Positive transaction over all.",1372291200,,211,4.675675675675675
1419741,1,B00005B1YR,"So, when my girlfriend broke up with me, she took the dvd player. Ok, I can deal with that. But in that dvd player was my copy of December 7th that was a bonus disc I had gotten with a collection of Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" propaganda/documentaries. Over the past few months, December 7th had become a household favorite, oft quoted by me and my friends. So I took it upon myself to order another copy. As soon as I put this copy in, I could tell something was wrong. This version of December 7th is heavily edited and conveniently expunges the first 20 minutes or so, which is incidentally, the half of the movie with all of the quality material. So this version has no Uncle Sam, no Mr. Conscience, no sugar cane and pineapple, and as a result is a totally different movie. What is left wasn't even worth watching. The remaining documentary is called ""Recognition of the Japanese Zero"". It's very bare bones and less than a half hour long, but you may get a kick out of seeing what Ronald Reagan looked like when he was a teenager. Whether that alone is worth the money is for you to determine, but as for me, I will have to find a new copy of December 7th that is UNEDITED. Disappointing.",1371600000,5,1195,4.339285714285714
1419742,5,B00005B1YR,"Kept from the public for many years, this documentary tells about the attack like you've never seen.  The propaganda films added are a must to see, especially for history buffs.  One can see how complacent we were about the Japanese and how the military screw-ups contributed to the devestation we received.",1324598400,2,307,5.0
1419743,5,B00005B1YR,"The extras on this product are great, especially the Know Your Enemy (The Eighth in Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" Series).  The images and newsreels are great for showing what was happening during the attacks and show a better idea of what was going on during the time - excellent use in the classroom.",1198022400,,301,4.574074074074074

1419745,4,B00005B1YR,"This DVD contains two documentaries. The first is John Ford's film about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  I had mixed views about this film.  I thought the original scenes from the attack were very interesting, and there were some scenes which I've never seen before.  However, the scenes which included the plastic models were very poorly done.  I realize this film was made over fifty years ago, but I was still disappointed with the poor use of the replicas of the American battleships.  It was very easy to tell that they were not real.

The second documentary on this DVD was much better.  It deals with the kamikaze attacks against the American fleet off Okinawa.  The footage in this documentary is all actual.  The viewer gets a true sense of what it was like to fight against an enemy fully intent on diving their plane into an American ship.  The skies were literally full of anti-aircraft shells, yet the kamikazes kept on coming.  Most never made it to their targets, but some did manage to break through, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the ships' crews, most of the ships were operational after the attack.  However, some ships, such as the USS Franklin, suffered a much worse fate.

Overall,I gave this DVD 4 stars; the Pearl Harbor documentary gets 3, while the Okinawa documentary gets 5. Some parts of the Pearl Harbor documentary were very interesting, but I thought the poor use of the models greatly detracted from the overall quality of the film.  On the other hand, the Okinawa film was excellent.  The footage is all authentic, and the viewer gets a real sense of what it was like to be in a kamikaze attack.

I recommend this video highly.  Both documentaries describe two important parts of World War II; one at the beginning of the war, and one at the end. Watch this video and see what it was like to fight the Japanese attackers at Pearl Harbor and survive a kamikaze attack in the waters off Okinawa.",1136246400,10,1930,4.612903225806452
1419746,4,B00005B1YR,"This movie is a good documentary about what happened in Pearl Harbor, Hawa, on December 7, 1941. It is curious to still see the word ""CENSORED"" on the screen of the radar more than 60 years later; there are no more secrets about radar. So, if you wish to remember December 7, 1941 or to try to understand what happened, it is a good DVD to buy.",1120003200,3,344,4.149253731343284
1419747,3,B00005B1YR,"I don't quite know what to say about this. John Ford is an important director. I suppose this is important historically speaking, but it is very racist. It's propoganda, and not against the enemy, but against out own people. This is the type of work that allowed us to have our deterrment camps. On the plus side, Huston, who plays Uncle Sam, does argue that they are Japanese-Americans are as American and as loyal as any other. But we have Mr. C., which is U.S.'s conscience telling us different. I'd like to think that the rational side won the arguement in the film, but we know from history it didn't. And the film ended with our people as the enemy.",1054425600,2,655,4.466666666666667

7936254,1,B00005B1YR,"What should have been a great piece of American history was destroyed by artistically vacant politically correct censoring.  The historically most significant parts...Uncle Sam and Conscience...were edited out.  If I had known this I would have never purchased this DVD. It was not marked ""edited"" aka censored.  I feel I have been rip-offed by Amazon and am now off to a reputable retailer to find a true and accurate copy of the most important piece of American movie history.  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU CARE ABOUT ORIGINALITY AND ACCURACY.",1418774400,,539,4.955555555555556

Noted that the version here only ran a bit over 30 minutes when the one I saw ran over 1 1/2 hours.  Thought that this might be an error and checked the comments.  ""Harley"" pointed out that the disc has been edited greatly with some of the best material removed.  Even as cheap as the disc is selling for it is not worth the price.  Thanks for saving me the disappointment, ""Harley"" and Merry Christmas!",1418083200,,560,4.186915887850467
