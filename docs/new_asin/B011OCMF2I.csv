7339111,1,B011OCMF2I,very bad movie.,1444176000,2,15,4.333333333333333
7339112,3,B011OCMF2I,Acting wasn't bad.  One thing weird I thought it seemed like they could have given the main actress a few more outfit changes.  All in all it was ok.,1483315200,,149,4.103448275862069
7339113,4,B011OCMF2I,Pretty good,1482624000,,11,5.0
7339114,3,B011OCMF2I,Would have given it four stars but for the absurd ending.,1482278400,,57,4.2727272727272725
7339115,4,B011OCMF2I,"A little campy at times....but that is what added to its charm.....not really scary but definitely creepy, makes you wonder the possibilities of this really happening. Good acting....likable characters (most of them)...and interesting ending. I thought there would be more of a twist, but all in all i did enjoy it.",1479600000,,315,5.196078431372549
7339116,2,B011OCMF2I,"Typical B horror film. Acting isn't terrible and the plot is simple enough to follow. Ends with a cliffhanger, which is good for this instance.",1477094400,,143,4.76
7339117,5,B011OCMF2I,"GREAT movie! Totally loved all of the actors, the story line, loved the ending too!",1474848000,,83,4.6
7339118,5,B011OCMF2I,"This was surprisingly good! I love well done horror, and although we've seen this ""ghost makeup"" before, it still held my interest. I also like the fact that they made reference to the old Twilight Zone episode on which this story was based.",1469923200,,241,4.627906976744186
7339119,3,B011OCMF2I,"This was a low budget direct to video release.  I'm warning those who are interested right now.  It was about a couple who move into a house and the boyfriend gets phone calls from a murdered woman who says she's her boyfriend.  They get the police and paranormal researchers involved, but have to take care of it themselves.  It was just average.  Not terrible or great, slow in places.",1465084800,,387,4.550724637681159

7339121,5,B011OCMF2I,"I thought it was pretty decent.  lately, they have horror movies with no real ghost or a fast/quick shot of one.  This has a creepy one and it appears throughout the latter half of the movie.",1464220800,,191,4.277777777777778

7339125,5,B011OCMF2I,"I agree with previous comments. No need for gore, blood and guts when it's way better to enjoy of one movie like this and have fun.
I wish they'd continue with a sequel to handle this final ""Eric stuff""",1459209600,,202,4.205128205128205

7339128,1,B011OCMF2I,"I couldn't even get through a half hour of this crap.  The movie plays like some teenagers made it in school for a project.  It got really repetitive really, really, really, really, really (see how annoying it is to hear the same thing over and over again?) really quickly.",1456617600,,273,4.551020408163265
7339129,4,B011OCMF2I,"Watched this on a flight, different than the usual.  This movie is recommended.",1456617600,,79,5.076923076923077
7339130,2,B011OCMF2I,Just ok.  Not too bad for a b grade film,1456531200,,40,3.0
7339131,1,B011OCMF2I,"I cannot recommend this to anyone for any reason.  It's that bad.  Acting was horrible, script was worse, plot was abysmal.  No amount of mood altering substance can make this even remotely worthwhile.",1456012800,,201,5.03030303030303
7339132,3,B011OCMF2I,"Good storyline, but actors were not very talented.",1455840000,,50,5.375
7339133,1,B011OCMF2I,"Not good at all. Terrible writing. Most of the actors did the best they could with that awful dialog. Not scary, creepy, or interesting.",1455840000,,136,4.708333333333333
7339134,4,B011OCMF2I,"For a small budget film, it was surprisingly creepy and well written.  I would recommend for a rainy day...as long as you leave the lights on!",1455753600,,142,4.461538461538462
7339135,1,B011OCMF2I,Acting was atrocious!,1455580800,,21,6.333333333333333

7339138,3,B011OCMF2I,It's not a bad movie. Would make a good Halloween watch. Comes off like a made for TV Lifetime movie.,1454803200,,101,4.1
7339139,3,B011OCMF2I,Good story line and plot. Acting is subpar.,1454371200,,43,4.5

7339141,2,B011OCMF2I,Good story line but the acting wasn't that great.  It was a clean scary movie.,1454198400,,78,4.2
7339142,1,B011OCMF2I,I struggled just to get through the first half of the movie. The acting was so bad and the story was so slow I couldn't watch anymore.,1454198400,2,134,4.0

7339146,5,B011OCMF2I,"I loved it low budget dark humor ghost story,  if you are looking for gory this movie is not it . I liked both couples really like the older man,but really thought that guy that pushing it as trying to make as ""actor "" might be more BUFF than doughy was kind of funny when women are supposed to be mooning over him and clothes could more nicer and you couldn't see his body for nothing, and he supposed to be a hunk! lol
The story kept me going. Good Dark humor .",1453593600,,463,3.978494623655914
7339147,1,B011OCMF2I,Mad at myself for watching this show,1453507200,,36,4.285714285714286
7339148,3,B011OCMF2I,Entertaining Indie.  Fun way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Cool ghost mystery. I liked the two main characters. I've seen both in other films and enjoy their acting.,1452988800,,170,4.827586206896552
7339149,2,B011OCMF2I,"Great idea for a movie, but very poor acting. Movie starts out good then it goes down from there. This could have been a really good movie.",1452211200,,139,4.185185185185185
7339150,1,B011OCMF2I,So bad I couldn't make it through the entire movie. Boring and unoriginal.,1452038400,,74,4.769230769230769
7339151,5,B011OCMF2I,Tremendous movie and scary. The actors did a great job.,1451606400,2,55,4.6

7339153,1,B011OCMF2I,"NOT EVEN A ( B ) MOVIE. MAYBE AN ( F ) MOVIE.  ACTING WAS BAD, DIRECTING WAS BAD. MAKEUP WAS A JOKE. HOW THE HELL THEY GOT THE $15.00 BUCKS TO PRODUCE THIS THING IS BEYOUND ME. I WANT A REFUND.",1447027200,3,193,3.5952380952380953
7339154,3,B011OCMF2I,It was a fun watch and a little creepy.  Not bad for a low budget film.  Worth the money!,1446768000,3,89,3.6315789473684212
7339155,3,B011OCMF2I,"Actually, it was kind of funny in its low budget bad-dialogue sorta way. If you like such movies, it's not without its charms. Unfortunately I wasn't looking for a comedy but a scary psychological thriller. I'll obviously have to keep looking.",1446768000,3,243,4.951219512195122
7339156,1,B011OCMF2I,This movie does not deserve a star.  Horrible just horrible all the way around. The acting is laughable so is the writing.,1446595200,,122,4.545454545454546
7339157,4,B011OCMF2I,"The movie has an interesting plot, worth watching and entertaining, somewhat reminiscent of the movie ""The Caller"". Loved the atmosphere and lack of gore which today seems very rare in supernatural/ghost movies. The quality is similar to a movie made for tv (like a lifetime movie, which is a nice achievement for a limited budget movie). A warning to the director: the song ""I'm coming for you"" by Russell Alexander might put you guys in trouble, it's too close to ""Susie Q"" by Dale Hawkins (especially the version performed by CCR) it's not in the public domain yet, you guys did a nice job with this indie movie, don't risk a lawsuit. Definitely more refreshing than the latest horror movies from the big studios :)",1446508800,7,718,4.752
7339158,1,B011OCMF2I,"Interesting story line for a Halloween movie but it is poorly acted, poorly depicted, insanely  bad dialogue.  Not even dialogue so bad you have to watch it to laugh.  Just bad all the way around.  Don't be sucked in by the cover.  I couldn't even make it to the end.",1446422400,,267,4.26
7339159,5,B011OCMF2I,"From Director Dean Whitney and Judy Whitney, Ghostline is a movie that delivers on suspense and surprising twists, without the blood and gore that seems to be so prevalent in scary movies these days. Chelsea and Tyler (actors Rachel Alig and Zach Gold) deliver realistic portrayals as the young married couple dealing with threats from Ellen via a ghostline  a line which one can make phone calls without having a specific number. Who is Ellen? Why does she think Tyler is Eric, the man she wants to make pay for what he did to her? Youll have to watch it to find out. A creepy, chilling movie that keeps you guessing throughout, with a very surprising twist at the end.

I enjoyed this movie and recommend it.",1446249600,5,710,4.582677165354331
7339160,2,B011OCMF2I,"Really? Do not believe any of the glowing shill reviews. I've seen better acting from cardboard cutouts, story is silly and lacks creativity. A waste of time and $..",1445990400,,165,4.724137931034483
7339161,4,B011OCMF2I,I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  I was hesitant to pay for the rental but glad I did.  The acting wasn't great but wan't the worst I've seen either. The story was good and entertaining enough. I didn't find it particularly scary but unsettling more than anything.  What would someone do if this actually happened??  If it kept happening and got progressively worse no matter what you did? Creepy...,1445904000,8,416,4.657534246575342
7339162,5,B011OCMF2I,"Rachel Alig and Zack Gold create great, realistic tension as a terrified couple who receive threats via a Ghostline. Because these two actors play a loving couple so genuinely , the scary, not so genuine , ghosts come off as believable . So many unsuspected twists and turns make this a fun thriller. Kudos to Dean and Judy Whitney for envisioning and seeing this project completed!",1445904000,4,382,4.803030303030303
7339163,1,B011OCMF2I,"Hardly good enough for a TV movie. Could picture this on the hallmark channel. I promise you, I watch real bad movies and can usually find a way to get into it. I thought the actress was real cute, but still turned it off. They all talk like soap opera actors or something. It killed me.",1445644800,,287,4.142857142857143
7339164,1,B011OCMF2I,"This movie starts with a body being buried and a white fluffy thing floating up out of the grave (a ""soul"" ?) into the sky till it hits a power line and bursts into flames.  At least that's what I thought at the time - I think it hit a phone cable and disappeared into the phone system hence name of movie.  This part, super cheesy though it is, was the highlight of the film as there was no dialog.  The acting is astonishingly poor and the dialog consists entirely of cliches as far as I can tell.  Reminded me of ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", only LSoC was a parody. Ghostline is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, a total waste of time and money.  Don't go near it except if you have a morbid interest in bad acting and terrible dialog.",1445644800,,754,4.136986301369863
7339165,4,B011OCMF2I,"I thought GHOSTLINE is one of the better movies out right now, before Halloween. The actors are good and there was just enough character development to make you care about what happens to ""Tyler""and ""Chelsea"", a young couple who were struggling actors that had to move to a house that ""Tyler's"" aunt had left them after she died. The plot was very spooky and well developed over the timeline of the movie and the ending was a surprise that I thought was pretty cool. All in all, I really enjoyed this movie and it gave me some very scary moments and jumps while watching.",1445212800,7,571,4.5
7339166,5,B011OCMF2I,This fast paced film is quite the thriller. Really enjoyed it!,1445126400,6,62,4.7272727272727275
7339167,5,B011OCMF2I,"Great film to watch for Halloween!  I like a good scare without tons of blood, guts, and gore. This is a well done horror film.  Great spooky twist and mystery.",1444953600,8,160,4.3
7339168,4,B011OCMF2I,"Anything directed by Dean Whitney and staring Mark Benjamin already guarantees you for a good time at the movies!!  Well acted, directed, and edited.  Highly recommend.",1444780800,4,168,5.423076923076923
7339169,4,B011OCMF2I,A good frightful movie for Halloween,1444780800,4,36,5.166666666666667

8724772,5,B011OCMF2I,Loved it!  And I guessed the ending!!!  Great movie not scary but beware murderers. Lol,1492905600,,87,4.733333333333333
8724773,2,B011OCMF2I,Not the best acting or editing.  Cheesy movie.,1492214400,,46,4.75
8724774,4,B011OCMF2I,"I'm a huge horror buff and I watch all levels of them from mainstream blockbusters to ultra low budget ones.  This movie definitely isn't one of the classics, but for some reason, I really liked it.  I watched it on Prime first and ended up buying a DVD for my collection.  Here's the skinny: It's a low budget film, the writing could have used some help and the acting isn't great (although it isn't horrible either).  BUT, with that being said, I found it to be an interesting concept about a couple receiving phone calls from a dead woman who wants revenge against the man who killed her.  For a lower budget movie, they did do some nice things with it and it's definitely not someone who just recorded it with their home camcorder. And it has a few good creepy moments.  I think it's worth a watch.",1491091200,2,802,4.385135135135135
8724775,1,B011OCMF2I,This played out like a high school drama class project.  The acting was so bad it should have been filed under the comedy genre.  We laughed the whole time.,1489104000,,156,4.344827586206897
8724776,1,B011OCMF2I,The rampant stupidity of this plot increases with each frame and scene. Got through maybe 10 minutes most.,1488240000,,106,4.944444444444445
8724777,3,B011OCMF2I,"Well, I thought finally a movie with a good ending but no, they had to ruin the last minute of it.  Why Hollywood??  Enough with the stupid chiche' twists.  They were cool in the 80s but not now.  It is overdone in every movie!!!  So my advice, watch it up until the last minute.  Then you won't be disappointing like I was.  The rest of the movie is surprisingly very well done.",1484784000,,379,4.180555555555555
8724778,4,B011OCMF2I,Good story with not the best known actors but still entertaining,1484179200,,64,4.909090909090909
