5678770,5,B00BW4S87A,"After nine years the Perry Mason franchise needed a rest. When the series began in the fifties, few shows were in color and the TV movie had yet to be invented. The earliest episodes of the series were often based on actual Earle Stanley Gardner titles, mostly pulp fiction mostly written in the thirties, forties and fifties.

By the time the television series ended there were seventy seven Gardner novels and two hundred seventy one television episodes. Each case required Mason, but virtue of courtroom theatrics as Hamilton Burger often put it, not only to get his client off but also to serve the interests of justice by revealing the identity of the true killer who confesses in open court. Gardner had over thirty years to produce his seventy seven novels, the scriptwriters were churning out about thirty episodes a season, three quarters of them original screenplays.

Those kind of demands take tolls on the writers, actors and directors. As time went by, the film noir grit and glamour of LA murders presented in grainy black and white began be stretched too far. And so, the final season of this iconic courtroom drama lacks some of the punch that hooked us so thoroughly during the Eisenhower Administration.

But this season is the last of the real Perry Mason. Paisanos Productions offered us Monte Markham in the title role of the ""New Perry Mason"" for a season in 1973. That fifteen episode dud, proved to be like ""new Coke"" and swelled the demand for the real thing. Burr and Barbara Hale, as Della Street, returned to make twenty five TV movies between 1986 and 1993. These were two hour jobs ( no original show was ever even a two parter), filmed in color (so much for film noir) and set in Denver.  Gardner had died in 1970,  and so it is safe to assume that the bankers, transactional lawyers and studio execs, didn't have the pesky creator around to scream bloody murder at the nightmare the franchise became in the eighties.

So let's face it, this is not the best season of the series that steered a lot of impressionable kids like me to a career before the bar. But it is lovingly restored and will complete your  personal collection of the trials of the greatest and luckiest lawyer ever to grace the small screen. So good is the restoration of this entire collection is that it looks great on a 55 inch LCD.",1368230400,59,2336,4.641646489104116
5678771,5,B00BW4S87A,"I have been watching Perry Mason since the late 1950's and have long since lost track of how many times I've seen every episode. I was hoping that it would eventually be released on DVD - uncut, sharp, commercial-free, and complete - and now it will be. The casting was perfect and Raymond Burr was born to play Mason. No one else has ever even come close. Someone once said, ""It's like having an old friend in the room"". That was probably more than 40 years ago and it's still true today.",1365811200,59,489,4.326086956521739

5678805,4,B00BW4S87A,"Perry Mason Season 9 Volume 1

These fifteen TV shows from 1965 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the Court of Last Resort which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. The titles begin with The Case of the .... None of these stories are from the novels (but may be based on some).

Laughing Lady;  Fatal Fortune;
Candy Queen [Silent Partner];  Cheating Chancellor.

Impetuous Imp [Negligent Nymph]; Carefree Coronary;
Hasty Honeymoon;  12th Wildcat.

Wrathful Wraith;  Runaway Racer;
Silent Six;  Fugitive Fraulein.

Baffling Bug;  Golden Girls [Vagabond Virgin];
Bogus Buccaneers.

The story in Hasty Honeymoon contradicts known examples from true crime.
The story in Fugitive Fraulein seems like a propaganda example that is out of place. Europe uses the Civil Law system where the judge (Procurator) leads the trial.",1459382400,,2489,5.085995085995086

5678968,5,B00BW4S87A,"Some of the stories were not as good as seasons past but overall this was still a very good show. The show did miss Ray Collins (inspector Tragg) and the banter between him and the rest of the cast however.

It's kind of a shame they didn't make some TV movies with William Hopper (Paul Drake) or William Talman (DA Hamilton Burger). It would have been great to see 2 or 3 more extended shows (or TV movies) with some of the old cast. But by the time they made more shows only Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale were still living.

I would rate this a very solid 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10 stars. And the nostalgia factor adds at least another 0.25 to 0.50 points!!

This arrived quickly in perfect shape. Picture and sound were very good. Price was pretty good. This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED especially for anyone who saw this during it's first run but just about anyone who likes good TV will like it as well.",1394409600,,897,4.264705882352941

I am only on the second disc of volume 1 but I will say that so far I am disappointed... the writing does not seem the same quality as in years past.. the shows sort of sloppy and meandering,  ""Andy"" Anderson (Wesley Lau ) is gone.. and his replacement, though a fine actor in his own right , just doesn't fill the bill. I am also seeing that several of the episodes are in fact remakes of episodes from earlier seasons.. why was this necessary? Did the writers go on strike? Did they run out of original material? The one I've watched so far, the Impetuous Imp? is a remake of the Negligent nymph.. though the basic story line is very similar.. a girl's rich aunt has died and her uncle is accused of the murder.. this story is very poorly made in comparison to the original episode ... very sub par. I know I'm in the minority here, but I def. think this season is quite mediocre.

5679045,4,B00BW4S87A,"By some coincidence, I received this today, the 20th anniversary of Raymond Burr's passing. It's really hard to criticize these long-running releases with the quality of the source material and mastering other than the half-season double-dipping, but at least we finally got the whole series (where are you, Alfred Hitchcock Hour?)...However, I have to gripe about something I doubt more than a few people will actually care about, but still a valid issue nevertheless.

Almost as famous as the show itself was its unmistakable theme. For the 9th season, the intro and outro music was redone mid-60s style, and it was quite different sounding than the version that had been nearly unchanged since late 1958....For one episode only (the first of the season), ""The Case of the Laughing Lady"", there was another, earlier arrangement of the theme similar to the rendition eventually used for the rest of the 9th season, but still noticeably different. On this DVD release, the music for this episode has been replaced by the standard 9th season theme.

What happened to it? Why couldn't it have been preserved for this otherwise excellent quality release? We wanted the original, unedited episodes, with music intact (this doesn't seem like a rights issue, probably an oversight). You can also see during the end credits ""Music Composed and Conducted by Leigh Harline"", credited only for this episode. By the next episode, it was back to Richard Shores, the composer from the prior season. My guess is that Leigh Harline redid the music for the new season, but for some reason (maybe someone didn't like it?) they had Richard Shores re-record the new arrangement again his way. Unfortunately for us, there's now no easy way to compare the two as the first version is missing from this DVD set.",1378944000,,1789,5.0

Richard Anderson is featured as Detective Lt. Steve Drumm as chief investigator this season. Also Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg is not billed. In season 8 he was billed though the majority of the time he never appeared. The actor was in ill health and finally passed away. It was at Burr's insistence his billing be continued.

A little contempt of court around season 8 but seems to have been corrected-Objection sustained.",1371686400,,248,4.928571428571429

5679123,5,B00BW4S87A,"Perry Mason was one of the great classic series of the late 50's and early 60's. Personally I think I preferred seasons 1-7, but I still enjoy ALL of the shows. They managed to do a great show without graphic language or graphic violence!",1371600000,,238,4.431818181818182
5679124,5,B00BW4S87A,I purchased this for my husband.  Works like a charm.  Will not use any other pain reliever.  First got the small size and then went for the largest jar we could find.  Highy recommend this product.,1371254400,,198,4.416666666666667
5679125,5,B00BW4S87A,"Great classic courtroom drama.. Good TV without the graphic sex, language or violence of today's shows. Just good story lines, good plots, great 50s & 60s fashions and cars. And it looks great in black & white",1371168000,5,209,4.675675675675675
5679126,4,B00BW4S87A,"I chose this rating as I really like this Ninth & Final Season of Perry Mason.  They have all aged gracefully and it is nice to see Paul Drake still the consummate private detective and friend, ever faithful secretary Della Street and the fiercely independent Hamilton Burger honorable contemporaries in the courtroom with Perry.  The stories are well acted and it is nice to see stars who have gone to other careers getting their start in this wonderful series.  I was sorry to see Wesley Lau leave but Richard Anderson as Lt. Steve Drumm is a welcome replacement.  But the real enjoyment is seeing Raymond Burr in his signature role of which he has made his own doing the professional job he has always done.  Anybody that longs for the series that were shown in the past that bring back memories of what TV use to be and, sadly, won't be again, will love the memories it brings back.  I am looking forward to seeing the Volume 2 of this Final Season and feel bad to see it end.  Highly recommended.",1371168000,22,1001,4.497237569060774
5679127,5,B00BW4S87A,"So we have finally arrived at the first volume of the final season: it's all here.

Going into the home stretch, the makers of the program allowed themselves a little more experimentation.  Paul Drake is featured in ""Carefree Coronary"", Perry goes solo to Germany again (Berlin, this time) in ""Fugitive Fraulein"".  Co-Star turns by Roman Gabriel of the LA Rams (""12th Wildcat"") and Bill Williams (Barbara Hale's husband, same episode), Noah Beery in ""Hasty Honeymooner"", and many others.

This volume also features what is perhaps the most stylized beginning segment of the entire series: ""The Silent Six"" which packs much wordless action into two minutes to the accompaniment of Chopin's ""Fall of Warsaw"" prelude (last prelude.)  Does this version on DVD have something that you never hear on TV?  Namely, the resolution from the final two anguished chords?  YES!

(PS:  Yes, ""Silent Six"" is also the Perry Mason response to the Kitty Genovese murder of March, 1964, just as Season Seven's ""Nebulous Nephew"" is a response to the Civil Rights struggle in 1963.  There's a lot of cultural history to be gleaned from this series.)

Highly recommended to all Perry lovers.",1370908800,9,1169,5.0680628272251305

5679130,5,B00BW4S87A,"Anybody who knows Perry Mason, knows he wins all of his cases. For nine years, Mr  Mason not only wins but he dose it in a way that entertains, inspires, and keeps you coming back every week  for more. As I said in a earlier review, it's too bad a 10th season wasn't film then we'd would  have had him in Technicolor. Highly recommended!",1370131200,4,337,4.234375
