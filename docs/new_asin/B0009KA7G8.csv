8062671,2,B0009KA7G8,"I'll not tell you about the movies themselves, just how they look. All the movies are 1.37:1 (4x3), not a wide screen in sight.
*CREATURE has washed out color, but so do all the other prints of it. The nudity and language is intact.
*PHANTOM FROM SPACE looks a little better than a VHS print. Buy the Legend disc for the best copy and it's colorized too...yikes!
*DAY THE SKY EXPLODED is on various discs and they all say it looks crappy and this print is not any better.
*DISAPPEARANCE OF FLIGHT 412 is a made for TV movie. Washed out colors but all the other discs say the same thing.
*WARNING FROM SPACE has washed out color too. Print is lousy, part of the bottom frame is visible on the top. It's also dubbed. This is the first COLOR movie out of Japan and here we don't get to see it here!
*PHANTOM CREEPS is a serial, but not here. This is one long movie without cliffhanging stops. Lousy print too!
*THE INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD is another one with a lousy print. I have the Something Weird Video print and it's very good.
*ROCKET SHIP is the serial made into a movies...another lousy print.

So there you have it, cheap, lousy prints. Some of them are needed if you are a completest and don't want to keep spending money not knowing what you're going to get.",1469664000,,1269,4.3544303797468356
