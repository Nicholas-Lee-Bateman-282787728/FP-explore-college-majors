7974296,4,B000075BHY,"I'm not sure ""like"" is the right word--it's like a car accident that you can't resist gawking at, or a bad smell that you can't resist going back to and sniffing over and over.  I remember seeing Rich Kronfeld's work on local Minneapolis TV back when I was still a resident of the Twin Cities (Mpls/St. Paul, that is). Dr. Sphincter is a deeply disturbing character, which is why it's such a good shtick. The Wally Hotvedt character is probably better known from the Comedy Central version of ""Let's Bowl"", but they should really consider reissuing more of the local versions. There are some lesser known characters of his that nail it too--like the sound-man with the mullet (can't recall the name). Kronfeld knows his subjects--perhaps a little too well.

This DVD is a good overview/review (for me) of Kronfeld's edgier stuff, but I wish there were more complete versions of the pieces. Kronfeld is still largely unknown outside of Minneapolis/St. Paul, so to say he's underrated is probably unfair. Underexposed is probably more accurate. His local TV spots are seriously among the handful of things I really miss about living away from Minnesota.",1404259200,2,1151,4.927835051546392
