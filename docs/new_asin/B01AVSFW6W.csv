7613729,5,B01AVSFW6W,"Finally a box set chronologically about the Dudley Boyz has been released following a set released years back about their careers in the original Extreme Championship Wrestling. From ECW to WWE to TNA to International Promotions around Bubba Ray and D-Von have left a path of destruction and broken tables in their wake. Even broken glass tables. Straight Outta Dudleyville is a box set the WWE Universe and the world has waited for. Mark and Devon finally get a chance to discuss their careers and their personal and professional lifes. From Steet Fights to Steel Cage Matches to Table Matches to Ladder Tables, Ladders & Chairs Matches. From early feuds in ECW to their triangle feud with The Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian to their singles careers to World Champions. The Dudley Boyz have created an everlasting legacy which started over 20 years ago. From life long fans to the squared circle. The Dudley Boyz have proven dreams really do come true.",1461974400,2,956,4.871165644171779
7613730,4,B01AVSFW6W,"It's no big secret that the treatment of tag team wrestling had it's highs & lows over the past two decades from teams having years of history together delivering show stealing matches on big events to singles wrestlers forming these short term teams becoming tag team champions reduced to being an afterthought with their championship matches at best being on the pre-show of the biggest events of the year but there has been one team who has stood the test of time (despite brief periods of singles runs) to also being the only team to hold every championship of every major promotion they've competed for not only in the United States but in Japan as well & here is their story of Bubba Ray & Devon...The Dudley Boys.  You hear from their family & friends along wrestling personalities throughout the presentation including Tommy Dreamer, Johnny Rodz, Tazz, Joey Styles, Sign Guy Dudley, Raven, Spike Dudley, Rob Van Dam, Rhyno, Lance Storm, Edge, Christian, J.B.L., Ron Simmons, Road Dogg, The Ascension, Mick Foley, Kofi Kingston and some of the students from their wrestling school including Leva Bates (NXT's ""Blue Pants"").

The documentary stars out looking at their different childhoods from Devon's that influenced his phrase of ""TESTIFY!"" & what infamous moment Bubba was in the front row to witness to what similar & different sports both men played in high school.  How each man got into the wrestling business was discussed next from Devon's training with a WWE Hall Of Famer while caring for his twin sons to why Bubba refuses to give credit to the man who trained him before going into how each came into ECW including one of their first impressions of the promotion being ""what is this crap?"" followed by the origins of the Dudley gimmick from who's idea it was & what they based it off of along with what influenced their individual characters.  Going from opponents to partners was discussed next including what staple of the team was created that same night & how they became the hottest heels in the company including elements they did like to push that fact such as their ""theme music.""  Their legacy in ECW lead to the discussion of coming to WWE & how they had a bad reputation coming in based off what a previous team did months earlier only & what their ""physical test"" was to show they had the right attitude before going into how they made tables their signature followed by going into their series of ladder/T.L.C. matches against Edge & Christian & the Hardys as far as being innovative & how they made each match different.  Their popularity was talked about with Devon telling a funny story of what happened in church before going into why the decision was made to split the team up & eventually put them back together followed by the conditions that caused them to leave WWE.  Their reasoning behind going to New Japan & TNA Wrestling (yes, they referred to them by name) was discussed next along with Bubba's singles run as a World Champion & how Devon made up for ""lost time"" before concluding the documentary on what was their mentality for starting a wrestling school, Bubba's appearance in the Royal Rumble & how that effected Devon, their return, and discussion of their legacy.  Also shown throughout the documentary was a backstage look of their day leading to their return to WWE (including hiding out in a trailer to keep it a surprise) with them talking about different subjects such as their first meeting with Vince McMahon, their merchandise & ring gear.

Other DVD extras include Dudley Boyz remembering their various matches throughout the set (November 2 Remember '95, Barely Legal '97, WrestleMania X-7, Survivor Series '01, Bubba's World Title Match vs. Triple H, ECW One Night Stand) & bonus stories such as a story behind one of Bubba's wrestling buddies used as a pillow, what championship did Devon defend against his high school teacher, Bubba's biggest fears in the beginning of his career, Devon showcasing who influenced his character, Spike Dudley's first interaction with the Dudleys, memories of Mae Young, what prediction they made in Times Square that eventually came true, what happened with Rhyno the night before WrestleMania X-7, what happened when a current WWE announcer met Bubba at WrestleMania X8 while other Blu-Ray extras include their 2015 return to WWE on RAW.

MATCHES:
Buh Buh Ray & D-Von Dudley vs. The Pitbulls - This started out as a four way brawl & remained that way for several minutes with both teams fighting throughout the arena taking chairshots throughout the match & sacrificing themselves to take out their opponents with more than just the legal participants getting in on the action in what can't be described more than just an out of control brawl.
""ECW Hostile City Showdown"" Apr. '96

Buh Buh Ray Dudley vs. D-Von Dudley - The tensions between the brothers finally came to a head here with both men trading fist at the bell & having similar strategy against each other from leaving their feet to take the other down to fighting on the outside using whatever they could get their hands on in what was with the match ultimately coming down to one man doing something that would later become forever linked to both men.
""ECW November To Remember"" Nov. '96

D-Von Dudley vs. Tommy Dreamer - This was from the infamous episode of ""Monday Night RAW"" from the Manhattan Center where ECW had matches to promote their first PPV with Dreamer showcasing why he was ""The Innovator Of Violence"" very early on the outside of the ring only for D-Von to give some receipts showing some innovations of his own as this ultimately just an exhibition of the ""extreme wrestling"" that ECW was known for.
""RAW"" Feb. '97

ECW Tag Team Championship Match vs. Eliminators - Dudleys attacked from behind after Sign Guy helped with a distraction (and payed for it) with them hitting some hard hitting moves like the Bubba Bomb & diving headbutt before Eliminators started making a comeback using their educated feet for various kicks & aerial offense such as the moonsault & various splash from either a backflip or 450 position along with executing both kicks & splashes from a springboard position. This was a hot opening match that saw both teams showcase their array of offense with Eliminators diverse offensive style leaving an impression.
ECW Barely Legal '97

Dudleyville Street Fight Match w/Big D. Dudley vs. Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Spike Dudley - This started off with both teams wrestling & taking some big moves early from D-Von taking a reverse neckbreaker while hanging off the top rope to Spike being tossed & thrown around like a rag doll before the match broke out in an all out brawl on the outside & into the crowd before making it back to the ring where various weapons were being used such as a dive off a ladder in the ring to the outside & later a senton off the ropes onto their opponent laying on the ladder, four way trees of woe dropkicks with chairs, one tossed out of the ring through a table, one guy on the receiving end of a killer chairshot, and a DDT onto a ladder. This was nothing more than a weapons filled brawl that not only got physical with all six men but anyone else associated with them both during & after the match.
Heatwave '98
[ECW: Extreme Rules]

ECW Tag Team Championship Match vs. Tommy Dreamer - Bubba & D-Von came back out after their championship victory earlier in the night threatening to leave ECW with the belts & destroy the company by eliminating Tommy Dreamer taunting him into a match alone despite having an injured back & was able to get some offense in with the help of a ladder only for the odds to catch up as they beat on Dreamer's back non-stop using the ladder along with moves like a belly to back suplex along with whipping him with the title belt to the point where other officials & wrestlers including Sign Guy Dudley asking them to stop before the last person you would ever expect from Dreamer's past came to save him. The match itself wasn't much past the unexpected ending but this was more about what happened after the match that was never seen on television where Bubba & D-Von gave an emotional farewell speech.
""ECW On TNN"" Aug. '99
[ECW: Best Of The Dudley Boyz; ECW Unreleased Vol. 3]

vs. The Acolytes - The Dudleys made their official WWE debut earlier in the month & now facing off against the same team who ran out a previous team with a reputation made in ECW with this match starting out as a brawl with the Acolytes being physically dominate in & outside of the ring while the Dudleys kept relying on various double team combinations to keep control in their favor in what was a physical match but only significant for it being the first WWE PPV performance of the Dudleys.
Unforgiven '99

Tables Match vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever Tables Match in WWE history & the Hardys knew that it was going to be so dangerous that they forbid Terri to be at ringside as both teams started brawling in the isleway with Jeff on the receiving end of a full nelson powerbomb in the opening seconds before the tables were brought into play right away such as Jeff having a table thrown at him in mid-air only for the Hardys to counter by bringing out ladders & chairs resulting in some stiff chairshots by both teams & Hardys connecting with a double leg drop off the top rope & ladder. Both teams had the tables work in their favor & against them such as both Hardys missing their high risk offense going through tables on the outside, a powerbomb through a table that was setup on the steel steps, one man falling through stacked tables, and Jeff Hardy being the highlight reel he is sacrificing himself with a swanton bomb to put one of the Dudleys through a table. Tables matches today are a stable & cliche in WWE but this was the very first one & both teams did what they did in the later T.L.C. series & set the bar pretty high for others to follow.
Royal Rumble '00
[Hardy Boyz: Twist Of Fate; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]

vs. WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws - Both teams went back & forth early with a team using classic tag team strategy singling out one of their opponents & keeping a fresh man in with frequent tags causing their opponents to resort to dirty tactics of their own to gain some momentum in a contest that served it's purpose but kept short due to one of the men coming into this match injured.
No Way Out '00

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever T.L.C. match which is the same concept as a ladder match except tables & chairs were also legal & encouraged to be used as well while it should also be noted that this was a homecoming for the Hardy's with them being from North Carolina. You had various crazy moments with all three weapons being legal such as Edge legsweeping both Devon & Matt off ladder, Bubba powerbombing Christian off a ladder, Edge pushing Jeff off a ladder that caused another ladder to catapult into Matt's face, Christian getting a 3D through a table, Edge hitting everyone in sight with a chair, Christian launched into Edge who was sandwiched in between a ladder, Jeff's swanton bomb off a ladder through tables, Bubba going off a ladder in the ring through stacked tables on the outside, Lita getting involved & paying for it, Matt falling backwards off a ladder out of the ring through tables, and Devon & Jeff hanging from the tag titles. This was a ""car crash"" that took your breathe away.
SummerSlam '00
[Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith; Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams; The Ladder Match]

Tables Match vs. The Rock & The Undertaker - This match had an interesting setup as Rock & Undertaker were opponents at the upcoming PPV but forced to team together here with the stipulation that neither man could attack the other as you saw both of them very reluctant to team including one giving a stiff tag to the other which allowed the Dudleys to take advantage of the tension between the two along with double team tactics in a solid tag match that told the story of one two individuals facing one team in their specialty match.
""Smackdown!"" Sept. '00

vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian - They Dudleys were coming into this match with concussions from attacks by the champions earlier in the week with they Dudleys taking the fight to them right away brawling in the isleway before E&C were able to take advantage of the effects of their injury heavily focusing on the head area using whatever tactics possible with the Dudleys fighting from behind & taking advantage of E&C getting too arrogant.
Royal Rumble '01

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - The rematch from SummerSlam here at WrestleMania except this one also including each team's associates (Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Lita) getting in the action as well. You got all the crazy spots as expected here such as Bubba powerbombing Jeff onto Edge through a table, Christian falling off a ladder in the ring straight to the floor, Spike Dudley delivering a dudley dog off the apron through a table on the floor, Rhyno giving a gore through a table, various loud chairshots to the head, Jeff Hardy doing a swanton bomb off the highest ladder through a table & later attempting to walk on the ladders like a tightrope, Matt & Bubba falling out off the ladder through the stacked tables at ringside, and the highlight reel of Edge spearing Jeff while he was hanging from the tag titles that WWE used in promotional videos for years after this match. T.L.C. II followed the same patterns as their previous matches in that this was full of ""Holy S..."" moments one after another.
WrestleMania X-7
[Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith; The Ladder Match]

WWE Tag Team Championship Match vs. The Rock & Kurt Angle - This was a unique situation in WWE (possibly wrestling) history as this was the first time two World Champions (Rock as WCW & Angle as WWE) teamed up to challenge for the Tag Team Championships as they traded momentum early on with one team taking advantage of their opponents mistiming while the others were able to cut the ring off singling out one opponent working over a previous injury in a solid match.
""SmackDown!"" Sept. '01

vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz - The Hardys were in control early with fast pace double team offense causing the Dudleys to resort to illegal tactics & double teaming of their own to regain control including a version of the 3D that I don't remember previously seeing in what was a short match only significant for the historical factor that was made.
""SmackDown!"" Oct. '01

Steel Cage/Unification Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Hardy Boys vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz - The Hardys were in their home state here as it started off as a regular match with both teams tagging in their partners before eventually evolving into a brawl with the cage coming into play at times such as Matt's leg being hooked at the top & hanging upside down from the cage. Stacy Keibler had a creative way of getting involved when Bubba called to ""Get The Tables!"" but the bigger story here was the conflict between Matt & Jeff as Matt was focused on winning the match while Jeff's mind was on being his usual daredevil self. I know some people compared this to their TLC matches but this was able to stand out on it's own and it wasn't one of those ""bloody massacre"" cage matches but they don't disappoint anytime they're allowed to go one on one in a tag team match and this is the same as well.
As a funny side note, you could tell how confusing it was having so many championships in the company during that time as the production team introduced the Hardys as the WCW Tag Team Champions when they were the WWE Tag Team Champions.
Survivor Series '01
[Allied Powers: The World's Greatest Tag Teams; Greatest Steel Cages Of All Time]

Reverend D-Von vs. Triple H - Triple H came into this match banged up from an attack earlier in the night with D-Von heavily focused on the head area whenever Triple H attempted to gain momentum while taking shortcuts whenever possible to the point where he was bleeding from the cut as Triple H kept fighting back including using his opponents own momentum in his favor in a solid match that's more memorable for the debut of D-Von's ""deacon"" who would go on to have a history with both men in this match throughout his career.
""SmackDown!"" May '02

Bubba Ray Dudley vs. Brock Lesnar - This was Brock's first official match against a man of close to his size & strength in Bubba who threw the first punch right at the start continuing with hard punches & chops while Brock showcased his strength such as breaking a submission attempt & lifting Bubba off his feet while Bubba showcased power of his own tossing Brock around like we hadn't seen up to this point & using some of Brock's advantages against him in a physical encounter that saw Bubba bring the fight to Brock that nobody had before.
""RAW"" May '02

Bubba Ray Dudley vs. World Champion Triple H - Bubba took issue with Triple H being handed the World Championship leading to this match that saw him take the fight to Triple H right away with none of his usual distractions not working causing Triple H to resort to more illegal tactics to gain the advantage in a solid back & forth match that gave Bubba more credibility walking out as a singles star than he did walking in.
""RAW"" Sept. '02

vs. Rey Mysterio & Rob Van Dam - The Dudleys recently aligned themselves again with Paul Heyman & turned own their ECW alumni RVD setting this match up with them using dirty tactics right from the start only for both men going aerial to the outside before the Dudleys took advantage of their surroundings & still stretching the limits of the disqualification to regain the momentum only for Mysterio to come back with his lucha libre style & RVD's educated feet while both teams used different types of double team maneuvers in a competitive fast & physical encounter.
Judgment Day '04

vs. Tommy Dreamer & Sandman - It should be noted that the Sandman's entrance on the original PPV broadcast was ""Enter Sandman"" but that's been dubbed over with generic music on this release & we got a bunch of appearances from many fellow ECW alumni resulting in ""a brawl before THE brawl"" with Joey Styles hitting the line of the night in response to one chairshot that was delivered. It didn't take long for both teams to start assaulting each other with weapons from a cookie sheet to the cheesegrader causing blood to floor & Bubba wearing it as war paint before Dreamer payed homage to Terry Funk with his classic ladder airplane spin while Sandman also was able to use the ladder against Devon on more than one occasion with Bubba eventually able to use the ladder to his advantage with a frog splash onto it. Things got even more chaotic when other people wanted to ""make an impact"" at the expense of both teams leading to a ""catfight"" & reunion that ECW fans have been waiting 7 years for only to be eventually topped by another family reunion that involved a road sign, singapore cane, and the flaming table. To steal a line from the original ECW...this is ""EXTREME"".
One Night Stand '05
[ECW: Extreme Rules]

WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day vs. Dudley Boyz - The Dudleys returned to WWE after SummerSlam to capture their 10th tag team championship in WWE as Kofi started out disrespecting Devon & later Big E doing the same to Bubba which only fired them up taking control in dominate fashion with impactful offense & double team maneuvers before the New Day took control using whatever they could from their numbers advantage to using their individual strengths & double teaming in their own entertaining way in a good match with the only thing negative I can say was the result depending on how you want to look at it.
Night Of Champions '15

(Blu-Ray) Elimination Tables Match vs. Test & Albert vs. Edge & Christian - Two teams started out focusing on each other using double team tactics while the third team picked their spots leading to different highlights such as one man kicking a table in half through both members of one team & tables being used in different ways than just ultimately putting a body through in a solid encounter.
Rebellion '00

(Blu-Ray) Tables Match vs. World Tag Team Champions vs. La Resistance & Rob Conway - This was originally a six man tables match but Spike Dudley was injured earlier in the week causing this to be a handicap match only for Co-General Manager Steve Austin to also make it a championship match.  The Dudleys were dominate early taking out each opponent individually or together before the numbers eventually caught up to them giving Resistance the advantage singling out one of the opponents from his partner with one of the eliminations being karma from what happened earlier in the week.
Unforgiven '03

(Blu-Ray) vs. The Ascension - This was the Dudleys first WWE match in over a decade showcasing their trademark offense throughout the match along with having a response one team's protest of their return in what was nothing more than an exhibition match.
""SmackDown"" Aug. '15

(Blu-Ray) Extreme Rules Match w/Tommy Dreamer & Rhyno vs. The Wyatt Family - The ECW alumni returned to their old hometown of Philidelphia in this match that started as a brawl with weapons being brought into the match & used in the opening minute causing members of both teams either being put through or landing on the weapons on top of being assaulted with them as everyone continued to fight all around ringside & in the crowd to two men coming off the stage area through tables while another set of opponents got too stiff with each other causing a short shoot fight in what was a hardcore fight.
""RAW"" Dec. '15

The positives for this presentation is that once again we heard from various non-contracted names that we don't normally hear from in WWE presentations while I think most the match selection has gotten most of their significant matches (for one reason or another) but the biggest positive I can say is that WWE didn't act like they just disappeared for a decade before returning by not only actually acknowledging TNA past just a quick one line comment (see Sting's DVD) but Bubba as their World Champion when they've never done previously including showing a photo of him as his ""Bully Ray"" character while any other negative I can think of outside out be nitpicking (censorship of foul language, never acknowledging the name ""Team 3D"", no Paul Heyman).  In the end to take a page out their book, reviewer...GET THE DVD!",1461110400,3,22615,4.643089227693077
7613731,3,B01AVSFW6W,"I'm pretty sure this only got created due to the Dudley Boyz returning to the WWE Universe
Even the title trying to get some attention from Straight Outta Compton
with Straight Outta Dudleyville is so hack and cheap
But, that's the WWE for you out of touch and living in a bubble
The Dudley Boyz as a tag team were above average in ECW (That got the major push mostly cause ECW was short on tag teams)
The original version of The Dudley's were a handful of guys it was this cringe worthy comedy gimmick

Once all the side characters were fazed out and the team was retooled with just Sign Guy Dudley and Joel Gertner
Then we got the legit heal Dudley Boyz this alternative version of the Dudley's would be the tag team that would remain until today (Minus Sign Guy and Gertner)
They were best at being a heel tag team and getting heat and almost causing riots during both house shows and PPV
That being said this documentary is rated PG that really speaks volumes
It should've been rated Mature/Rated R and aimed at a mature audience
This Documentary will be nothing more then safe family friendly spin
That's like doing a PG documentary on Ron Jeremy
I honestly doubt it will be a shoot style documentary
Bubba Ray is known for being a massive problem with plenty of the boys (will he come out and admit that?)

If you want a more uncensored best of check out The Best Of The Dudley Boyz by Pioneer
or just get commercial back catalog dvds
I'm sure all the classic ECW matches will be butchered and edited for a younger audience
There matches during there Attitude era run will more then likely edited too
I doubt you'll see The Dudley's getting wood and dropping woman into tables
There 3-way dance matches with The Hardy's and Edge&Christian are insane (and broke almost all the men)
I'm a bit curious how the WWE is gonna explain the Dudley's being gone for a decade since the WWE doesn't recognize any other Pro Wrestling promotion It's just close to impossible to do a real Dudley Boyz best of/documentary in this way it's gonna be safe and watered down
But, what do i know i know nothing..............",1454889600,6,2108,4.486979166666667
