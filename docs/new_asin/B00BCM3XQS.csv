8566008,5,B00BCM3XQS,"I was not expecting this workout to be as intense as it was, I was using a 8 pound weight and a 20 pound kettle bell for the set that has the swings and according to my heart rate monitor I burned almost 600 calories which I thought it was amazing. The time flies by when I was doing this workout and I did find Jen really encouraging. I really liked this workout, she does offer modification if you are a beginner.",1435017600,,415,4.073170731707317
8566009,4,B00BCM3XQS,"I normally use Amy Dixon Breathless Body workouts and Jillian DVD's and thought this was going to be for ""lighter"" days. I admit using an 8lb weight (dropped to 5 at one point) I SWEAT and got a great cardio workout. There is less stopping in this DVD very short water breaks and you're back. At times she sounded like Amy Dixon with her encouragement and the truthful sentiment, ""If you don't push yourself beyond your comfort zone, your body won't change""
I changed/modified a move that circled the body with weights,  thinking it wasn't as safe, didn't want to hurt shoulder, but burned over 300 calories in the 55 minutes the first time. I also wish it had a timer so you knew how much time was left, she would cue you, but I like to see it since that wasn't always consistent.

Overall, I think it will be a keeper, not a top 3, but definitely in the rotation.",1389744000,2,865,4.366459627329193
8566010,4,B00BCM3XQS,"I love this workout-the moves are easy to follow, but intense enough that you feel it.  Since you do each circuit 3 times (1 minute, 45 second, and 30 second intervals), it doesn't feel repetitive.  My only complaints are that the cueing isn't the best and the time is off.  For example, she will say you have 10 seconds left, but will go for 20 more seconds.",1362873600,,359,4.3283582089552235
