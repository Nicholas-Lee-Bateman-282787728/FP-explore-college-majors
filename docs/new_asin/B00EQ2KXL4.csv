5933934,5,B00EQ2KXL4,"This is the perfect gift for the bad movie connoisseur. If you are expecting to get a bunch of familiar B-movies, like Roadhouse, or Kickboxer, this is not the box set for you. This is the box set for the D-movies you've likely never heard of. These are movies so obscure and terribly made that they might be in the public domain by now. Featuring ""actors"" like Reb Brown, Weng Weng, Fred Williamson, and others. 290+ hours of acting, cinematography, editing, and scripting so bad it's funny. This is a perfect gift for hipsters, weirdos, and MST3K fans.",1388534400,6,554,4.663265306122449
5933935,4,B00EQ2KXL4,"I don't have this set yet, but thought it might be helpful to list the films in this set that are not currently available in any other Mill Creek set (as of this writing). The following 14 titles are only available in this set (at least as far as Mill Creek releases go, they may be available from other companies):

Alien Contamination
Alien Species
All the Kind Strangers
Atomic Rulers of the World
Counterblast
The Day the Sky Exploded
The Disappearance of Flight 412
The Doomsday Machine
Embryo
Eternal Evil
Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe
Idaho Transfer
Manhunt in Space
The Mistress of Atlantis

The other 186(!) films in this set are collected in other Mill Creek sets like the 50 Film Martial Arts set, the old Drive-In Cult Classics 50 Film set, etc. etc. This 200-film set is a pretty great deal, especially considering it would otherwise require buying 10+ sets to get all the Crown International Pictures films to which Mill Creek owns the rights.

It is worth noting, however, that this set does not collect ALL of the Crown International Pictures films licensed by Mill Creek. The following Crown International films are *NOT* included in this set, but are available in other Mill Creek sets:
Bloodlust (available in the ""Drive-in Cult Classics"" 32-film set)
Don't Answer the Phone (available in the ""American Horror Stories"" 12-film set)
Double Exposure (available in the ""Drive-in Cult Classics"" 32-film set)
Malibu High (available in the ""Drive-in Cult Classics"" 32-film set)
Noon Sunday (available in the ""Dangerous Babes"" 12-film set)

5933938,5,B00EQ2KXL4,"This is so much fun for the buck! And even though many movies here have a very poor transfer quality, that to me has a charm in itself. Just imagine how movies looked like in the real grindhouses and drive-ins back in the day, esp. with one and the same 35mm or 16 mm copy travelling from theater to theater. Scratches. So sometimes it feels more appropriate to not watch these movies in perfect high-def now. Anyway - there are some real gems here like The Hearse, Nightmare in Wax, Lurkers, Deathrow Gameshow, Don't Look in The Basement and Death Warmed Up. And mentioning these gems is still  to forget a whole  bunch of other fantastic movies here. If you love cult movies , the weird and/or pulpy - buy buy buy!",1510358400,,716,4.416666666666667

5933941,5,B00EQ2KXL4,"I like to call these box sets cheapies because they contain mostly low budget public domain b-movies that you can download for free just about anywhere, and I own more than a few of them(not all from mill creek). I love the cheapies!  Each movie is a departure from modern day summer blockbusters.  If you've seen one explosion or CG background or character you've pretty much seen them all. I just don't think modern films differentiate themselves from one another.  It's times like these I feel a great need to return to a simpler time where people tried harder and story mattered.  Well okay maybe that isn't always the case with these movies, but they do tend to be a lot less predictable.  Now I'm a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and what caught my eye with this box set was uncut versions of some of my favorite MST3K episodes.

The dvds are divided by genre, horror, western, comedy, sex comedies, sci fi, exploitation, and martial arts.  If you decide to take the plunge on this set you'll have plenty of diversity.  While I'm generally thrilled with this box set it does have some issues.  Even though I have them on other collections no Drive-In title is complete without Night of the Living Dead, Carnival of Souls, A Bucket of Blood, Messiah of Evil, or Bloody Pit of Horror.  Now I know those are on the other huge box set from Mill Creek but they are what I think of when I think quality Drive-In features.  The packaging is equal parts impressive and disappointing.  The 3D art on the cover is cool, it has a brief description of what to expect on back, history of the drive-in on the inside, and a booklet with synopses of the titles.  I can't say I'm a big fan of double sided discs.  Likewise all 50 discs are wrapped in paper envelopes and unfortunately the box isn't big enough to hold cdr cases.  In the long run these are minor problems, it still looks good on a shelf and you can store the discs outside of the box if you want.  The double sided discs are still a pain but if you're careful you won't scratch or damage either side.

If I may make a few recommendations for the uninitiated: The Devil's Hand, Don't Look in the Basement, The Doomsday Machine, Galaxina, Good Against Evil, Invasion of the Bee Girls, Ninja Death, Sextette",1484956800,5,2269,4.481751824817518

However, I do enjoy them a lot and each movie somehow drives you to a certain period of time that we would have liked to live or enjoy more, which we cannot do now. Overall I give it four stars because this collection IS what I was looking for: CULT FILMS!

5933954,3,B00EQ2KXL4,"For the most part, I like this product. The packaging is nice and I have enjoyed the films I have seen so far. The only complaint I have, and I have seen this in other reviews, is the watermark found in some of the films. This is why the product is only getting three stars from me. Normally, a watermark wouldn't bother me but this watermark is fairly large and, with very little opacity reduction, quite distracting. Mill Creek could have been a bit more subtle in including an unnecessary branding.
Also...
5 stars to Amazon customer service as my first order had a defective disc in it. Before I had even shipped out my defective boxed set, they had a new one at my doorstep in less than two days.",1430611200,9,701,4.358778625954199
5933955,4,B00EQ2KXL4,"Don't let the naysayers get you down, this is an insane box of cult cinema and, sure yeah, the transfers range from decent to dirt poor but many of these films will never see their own DVD release, let alone ever seeing Blu-ray Disc! If you're a transfer stickler, cool, this will definitely not be a box set you'll want in your collection though. If you're like me and you just love the films, quality picture or not, you need this box set. It is a must have for box set junkies and cult cinema wonks.

Then there are some that are below-average, the vast majority are just plain average, and only a few
would be considered gold or gems.
Am I happy with my purchase? Yes I am, as there are some movies I can watch over an over again.

Good value for how many films there are, but some are inferior quality prints compared to other available versions. The biggest reason I'm rating this so low is that several of the movies I've viewed had a ""Mill Creek"" watermark/logo that shows up numerous times during the film. That was disappointing to me, though it doesn't seem to be on the older releases they recycled from past sets I already had.

Went through ALL the discs and there were no wrong ones here, which is great news. The main reason for me to get this set were the two films starring Leo Fong: Killpoint & Low Blow. But the set includes other cool films, for instance the rare feature with Weng Weng: The Impossible Kid of Kung Fu. We have a lot of blaxploitation too. I still haven't watched a single item, but I think it is safe to say the picture quality varies and can be very low at times. That's ok. There are 200 (two HUNDRED) films for peanuts - the biggest cost at least for foreign buyers are the postage costs, but it is definitely worth it!",1530576000,,788,4.225165562913907

8608315,5,B00EQ2KXL4,Of the 3 recent orders placed on this account the 200 film Drive-In Cult Cinema Collection was the only one that was what it was and cost the price I was told it would cost.  Of the 200 films only about 30 cut it as worthy of the designation as 'cult classic' and only a fraction of those 30 have any significance to film history. What it does have is a huge catalogue of the trashy Crown International library and enough genre B & Z movies to keep me munching popcorn for weeks.

  OK, I know what you're thinking.  How's the video quality.  And how are the Movies?  Well there are a few that are bad.  But most are very good.  Most, if not all of these, were made for the Drive-In Movie circuit.  But for the price you really can't beat it.  And Having several genres to pick from is another plus.
