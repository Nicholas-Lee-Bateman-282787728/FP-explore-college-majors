1621550,3,B00005LC4O,"Two Wolves for the Price of One
Universal's packaging for this DVD containing Werewolf of London (1935) and She-Wolf of London (1946) calls it a ""Wolf Man Double Feature,"" but any connection between the two movies is purely factitious. Apart from the London setting and the word ""wolf"" in the title, the two have little in common. Nor does either have anything to do with the saga of Lawrence Talbot, the manic-depressive lycanthrope played by Lon Chaney Jr. whose adventures, commencing with The Wolfman (1940) occupy a modest place next to those of such big league creatures as Count Dracula, the Frankenstein monster, or the Mummy. More than anything else this program unintentionally documents the studio's decline between 1935 and 1946.
Werewolf of London recounts the misadventures of Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull), a British botanist who while traveling in Tibet in search of a rare plant called the moonflower or Marifasa Lupina Lumina is attacked by a werewolf bent upon obtaining the posy, an antidote to what the dialogue calls ""this medieval unpleasantness"". Upon his return to England, Glendon begins to exhibit the symptoms of werewolfery, but an unforeseen complication ensues when the other werewolf reappears in the shape of Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland), faculty member of the University of Carpathia, in hot pursuit of the plant the scientist is now attempting to cultivate in his private laboratory.
In the absence of a more suitable model for its debut werewolf epic, Universal seems to have taken inspiration from Rouben Mamoulian's extraordinary-and highly successful-adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, released in 1932, starring Fredric March. Not only does the werewolf Glendon strikingly resemble March as Hyde, but Werewolf of London takes over the motif of a man leading a double life which figures more prominently in the Mamoulian film.
Most importantly, both movies tap into the Faust legend, whose lineaments can be discerned beneath the hirsute faade of Werewolf of London quite readily-but with a significant difference. According to most versions of the story, Faust repents too late and suffers damnation, but the studio improves upon tradition. In what must be a unique example of transfiguration in the history of Christian theology, the closing shots represent Glendon's ascending soul as an airplane flying into the sky which then becomes the Universal logo depicting a plane circling the globe.
Directed by the otherwise undistinguished Stuart Walker, Werewolf of London has a screenplay by John Colton, who made Somerset Maugham's short story ""Miss Sadie Thompson"" into the hit stage play Rain. But even for a horror film, Werewolf of London contains an unusually high proportion of nonsense, including laborious, misguided attempts to reproduce the niceties of British upper class life, equally labored attempts at humor--such as one character's habit of referring to Dr. Yogami as Dr. Yokohama-the miserable Marifasa, and a collection of dotty dowagers drawn from both ends of the social spectrum. Especially forgettable are Zeffie Tilbury and Ethel Griffies (the lady ornithologist in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds) as a pair of tediously inebriated Cockney landladies.
But the movie's greatest liability is its lead. Glendon is supposed to be a saturnine savant, but as played by Henry Hull, he is stiffly sullen, as if he had mistaken a lead sinker for a suppository. Only Warner Oland, mainly known for portraying Dr. Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan, manages to inject a needed aura of mystery into the proceedings. Nevertheless, Werewolf of London has its moments, among them Glendon's first encounter with Yogami qua werewolf when the former discovers the moonflower, well-staged and well-photographed by Charles Stumar, as well as the subsequent transformation scenes, the true test of any werewolf flick.
In these sequences, Werewolf of London briefly achieves a sense of magic that far outstrips anything in Paul Verhoeven's effects-laden The Hollow Man. In fact, the unsung heroes of Werewolf of London are certainly the special effects wizard John Fulton and the makeup artist Jack Pierce. The first, who also supervised the trick photography of James Whale's The Invisible Man, did a skillful job of handling Glendon's metamorphosis from man into werewolf, while Pierce, the real creator of the Frankenstein monster, gave Glendon an appropriately savage demeanor in his lupine alter ego.
There is far less to say about She-Wolf of London, a psychological thriller impersonating a werewolf picture that might be described as George Cukor's Gaslight with fangs and claws. A tale about a series of mysterious attacks taking place in a London park located next to a mansion belonging to a family named Allenby, She-Wolf of London drags in some hocus-pocus about a hereditary curse-probably borrowed from John Brahm's superior The Undying Monster--to explain these events. But this idea remains so inadequately developed that it makes the Marifasa look like sound dramatic invention.
Perhaps the best thing anyone could argue in favor of She-Wolf of London is that owing to its tight editing-the running time is only 62 minutes-most people would not be likely to notice such gaping holes in the scenario as the heroine's not knowing that the woman she believes to be her aunt is actually her dead father's housekeeper and former inamorata. The rewards to be gleaned here are marginal indeed. She-Wolf of London is not only burdened with a ludicrous story line but a uniformly mediocre cast, although Sara Haden as the malevolent housekeeper does a plausible job of imitating Judith Anderson's bravura performance as Mrs. Danvers in Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca.
Still, the film, photographed by Maury Gertsman, boasts some striking shots of an unknown woman in white fleeing the Allenby manor in the middle of the night, and of the park shrouded in fog, for the delectation of anyone who has the patience to wade through the muck that surrounds them. The DVD is bare-bones without notable extras except trailers, but well-designed and user friendly. As with most of Universal's Classic Monster releases, the picture and sound quality of both movies is excellent.",1020729600,3,6229,5.286579212916246
1621551,3,B00005LC4O,"I received the Universal ""Wolf-Man Double Feature"" DVD yesterday, containing ""Werewolf of London"" and ""She-Wolf of London,"" in order to complete my UNIVERSAL MONSTERS DVD collection.
  I'm probably going out on a limb with my opinion, but here goes! You must understand, I'm of the age where I remember with nostalgia, SHOCK THEATRE, which ran on TV in the late 50s and early 60s. This is where I was exposed to and became a lifelong fan of Universal Horror Films, including such non-monster films such as this, Rondo Hatten's ""Creeper series, ect. Somehow I missed catching SHE-WOLF OF LONDON! And after numerous negative professional and fan reviews, I admit I wasn't expecting very much. But to my delight, I found the film to be quite entertaining! Let me explain.
  SHE-WOLF OF LONDON is typical of the type of Universal B-Movie chiller-filler, which occupied half of a double feature in the 1940s. It wasn't meant to be compared to classic horror such as ""Bride"" or ""Dracula.""  Its short running time and low budget was calculated, by the studio to deliver just enough entertainment to get by. Anything more on the part of the viewer would just lead to disappointment.
  Sure it's short. And Bogie & Becall had nothing to fear from June and Don Porter, but for the type of picture Universal produced here, its okey fare and undeserving of the unfair comparisons to THE WOLF-MAN.
  Also on the plus side, is the unmistakable atmosphere created by the studio's mastercraftsmen, such as the gothic art direction, lighting and photography, the music scoring and the spooky script.
  Admittedly, the story's resolution disappoints (no werewolf), and the mixed nationality of the cast betrays the early 1900's British setting, but c'mon, do you dare compare elegant French dining with today's special at Burger King? And how many times have you eaten a ""Whopper"" since you dined French?! So, if you accept SHE-WOLF OF LONDON as what is was meant, you shouldn't be disappointed. I, for one, applaud Universal for coupling it with WEREWOLF OF LONDON, if only because of its relatively restricted showings. If however, you view it thinking of it as a vintage horror masterpiece, of if you haven't been exposed to the missing elements of the excellent bonus materials contained in the first Universal Classic Monsters series, ""then now is the time to...well, you've been warned.""
  Also, hopefully someone can tell me if I have a defective DVD, although I'm afraid I don't. In SHE-WOLF OF LONDON's cast info, the film credits of June Lockhart, Dennis Hoey and others are conspicously missing. Hoey had credits in FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, as well as many SHERLOCK HOLMES features, and June Lockhart's credits continue to this day with the LASSIE TV series and subsequent TV movies, in addition to the LOST IN SPACE TV program and recent big screen effort. June also appeared in ""feature"" small and bit parts, including ""Sgt. York.""",1016668800,6,2934,4.975460122699387
1621552,5,B00005LC4O,"Here's another Universal DVD double feature that pairs one of the studio's stylish 1930's monster classics with a tepid offering from about a decade later. ""Werewolf of London"" is still the best wolfman movie ever, boasting a spiffy cast and a story line that moves from Tibet to London without missing a trick. Character actor stalwart Henry Hull turns star in a masterful portrayal of a very civilized monster (I like the part where the Hull werewolf dons scarf and beret just before leaving the house on his first kill!). Add that to wonderful performances from Valerie Hobson, Spring Byington and Warner Oland (Charlie Chan as a Japanese werewolf!), very solid direction, and first-rate camera work and you have the makings of a very entertaining film. In fact, ""Werewolf of London"" is so entertaining it earns 5 stars for this DVD in spite of its very weak companion and the lack of the kind of bonus features we've come to expect from the DVD format. (On the other hand, you do get screen bios & filmographies for all the actors in the two films. And since the casts boast the likes of wonderful character actors like Lloyd Corrigan and Dennis Hoey, you can learn alot about some very fine but rather obscure talents.) Picture quality and sound are both first class.",1012867200,5,1272,4.760180995475113

All we get are the trailers for the two films. She-Wolf of London is a complete misfire, lacking any real suspense and peopled with unsympathetic characters. Werewolf of London comes out slightly more enjoyable, and [SPOILER ALERT!] at least it actually does have a werewolf in it! The first 8 Universal single-movie releases all had entertaing and thorough documentaries, which included some info on all the sequels coming out now. But I wish they would have tried to get commentary tracks from film historians David Skal or Tom Weaver, as they did with Dracula, The Wolfman, The Creature, etc. If you're a Universal collector, there's no question you'll be adding these to your collection.

1621609,4,B00005LC4O,"Ah, that rarest of rare plants, mariphasa; who wouldn't go to Tibet to get one.  It certainly didn't stop poor doomed botanist Dr. Glendon (played by Henry Hull).  It certainly didn't stop rival botanist Dr. Yogami (played by Warner Oland).  Both end up werewolves and competing posy pickers (Yogami having a good head start in that regard).  Both end up terrorizing London.  It should also be noted that poor Dr. Glendon had trouble enough just dealing with his wife's dotty aunt (Spring Byington as Miss Ettie Coombes) and his wife's old beau (Lester Matthews as Paul Ames).  His wife (played by Valerie Hobson) is a gad about, glad for the casual advances from her childhood sweetheart (that must have been some childhood, considering Lester Matthews was 35 at the time of filming while Valerie Hobson was only 18!).  ""It's not just because there's moonlight.  Although, moonlight becomes you so.""
Rivalries abound, danger lurks everywhere, unfortunately, so does an inordinate amount of comic relief (Spring Byington and two rival landladies vying for Dr. Glendon patronage of their competing establishments).
On the plus side, there's a great performance by Henry Hull as the doomed botanist.  On the minus side, there's Spring Byington's unsympathetic performance as an aunt with a vicious tongue.  And I can't get around Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) as a werewolf.  Otherwise, not bad.  I did like the more minimalist makeup on the werewolves; it was a good reminder that they were still human beneath it all.  But yes, this movie owed a bit too much to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (not necessarily a bad thing).  It's claimed that's the reason this movie failed at the box-office.

As for the second feature, She-wolf of London, it's a pseudo horror film.  It's actually more of a mystery thriller.  Someone is trying to `gaslight' a young woman (June Lockhart) into believing she's a werewolf killing people.  It isn't difficult figuring who's behind this dastardly plot and why.  I don't understand why people keep trying to foist it off as a werewolf movie when clearly it's not.",1406419200,,2085,4.991304347826087
1621610,5,B00005LC4O,"As a matter of fact they don""t even go together at all. Why? Because I consider ""Werewolf of London"" to be not only a horror classic but one of the greatest werewolf pictures EVER made. Its right up there with ""The Howling"",An American Werewolf in London"" and the remake of ""The wolfman"" With Benicio Del Toro  and Anthony Hopkins. I consider the remake much more scary than the 1941 original with Lon Chaney. All 4 of the films just mentioned are to me the best werewolf fright pictures ever made. Where does that leave ""She Wolf of London"". Well they should not even be together. ""She Wolf"" isn""t a werewolf picture at all. Its a mystery, period. But by all means get this for the 1935 ""Werewolf of London"". Also I would like to mention a werewolf film that is often over looked maybe because of its title. And that picture is ""I was a teenage Werewolf"" from 1957. Starring Michael Landon, in his first movie role. Believe it or not this film is still not on dvd much less blue ray.

1621637,3,B00005LC4O,"""Werewolf of London"" 4.0 stars

This was one of my favorite werewolf movies as a kid but upon further review it wasn't quite as scary as I remember.  Primarily because the werewolves just aren't very vicious and go down too easy. Still, I think this is one of the best werewolf movie of the period (1935), nearly the equal to Lon Chaney, Jr's ""The Wolfman"" (1941). While genuine terror and gore are always lacking in the films of this era, ""Werewolf of London"" has some creepy moments. This is most evident when the werewolf guy goes to the Himalayas to find this rare flower which is his cure. Also of note here is Warner (""Charlie Chan"") Oland as one of the wolfies and Spring Byington who some may remember from the 1950's TV series ""December Bride"".

""She-Wolf of London"" 2.5 stars

Perhaps the most interesting thing about this short film (61 minutes) are the two leads. Don Porter and June Lockhart both went on the successful careers, almost exclusively in television. Some may remember Porter from ""The Ann Sothern Show"" and before that ""Private Secretary"" also with Ann Sothern from the early 60's.  He went on to numerous other shows including ""Gidget"". Likewise June Lockhart had a very successful television career. In fact she was still going, appearing on ""Grey's Anatomy."" She is the daughter of respected actor Gene Lockhart (""It's a Wonderful Life"").

Enough trivia. This film is certainly no horror movie. You know that right away because...no creatures are ever seen. Although the film is well acted, the plot has numerous holes in part I suspect, due to its brevity. It really becomes just a mystery that seems pretty evident after the first 10 minutes or so. The film itself is well preserved and looks remarkably good.",1359158400,3,1740,4.802675585284281
1621638,5,B00005LC4O,"Why isn't this movie as ""popular"" as THE WOLF MAN?  How did it happen?  I mean, yes... obviously the werewolf in WEREWOLF OF LONDON isn't as cool as the full-on Lon Chaney wolf man.  I get that.  And I get all the iconic stuff we get from THE WOLF MAN that isn't present here.  Okay.  But I dig the Tibet stuff.  I dig the whole ""a werewolf instinctively seeks to kill that which it loves most"" thing.  And let's be honest: Warner Oland rocks (I remember as a kid thinking how cool it was that Charlie Chan was in a werewolf movie).  In many ways, this is a more ""mature"" movie than THE WOLF MAN.  It's not quite as ""melodramatic"" and (if viewed in it's proper context) it's certainly a little more ""brutal"".

1621639,4,B00005LC4O,"Werewolf of London & She-Wolf of London, DVD

Stories of werewolves (man-wolf) go back centuries in the folk legends of many countries. They tell how a respected man can change into a monster during the night only to revert to his normal appearance during the daytime. Often the werewolf is an aristocrat, symbolizing their predatory nature. There is an old book ""Werwolves"" by Elliot O'Donnell that contains these legends.

""Werewolf of London"" (1935) was the little-known predecessor to the werewolf films of the 1940s. It is a dramatic story, like a morality play, that warns against human pride that leads to dangerous knowledge. The story about a dependency on an exotic flower could symbolize addiction to a rare substance. It also has a romantic triangle to add to the drama.

""She-Wolf of London"" (1946) is the last in the 1940s series of werewolf films. It is more of a psychological mystery than a horror movie but worth watching once. Near the end there is a surprise, it is not what you were led to believe. Lust and greed lead to murder again.

The most memorable thing for me about the movie is that I think it may have the most soulful, dramatic and effective music score of any of the old Universal horror movies, and that's saying a lot. Karl Hajos is credited with the score. If you're so inclined, check out music clips from 1930s Universal horror films at Tony LoBue's Flash Gordon web site.

More's the pity too, since it abounds in shadowy night scenes, fog, and much cloak and daggery, including a final act complete with tilted camera angles, and poisoned milk, (a la Hichcock's ""Suspicion"").

But there is no real grue and no real tension, and what we are left with is a lame, (though slickly produced) thriller whose main interest accrues from its interesting cast and glossy staging.

1621666,3,B00005LC4O,"Despite Universal's claim on the DVD that this is a ""Wolf Man Double Feature,"" neither of these films have any connection to the series of movies starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the werewolf-cursed Larry Talbot. The two films also have no connection to each other, but Universal apparently couldn't pass up the similarity of their titles to create this double-feature DVD. The films couldn't be farther apart. ""WereWolf of London"" was released in 1935, near the peak of Universal's first horror cycle that includes ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Mummy,"" ""The Invisible Man,"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" (also 1935). ""She-Wolf of London"" made it to theaters in 1946, just as Universal's horror films were about to die completely, and is more a traditional, bland murder mystery than horror film.
""WereWolf of London"" is probably the least talked about original horror film from Universal's classic era. It has some excellent points, such as Jack Pierce's clever makeup, interesting visual effects, and some well-done sequences, but overall it's a sluggish film. Stage actor Henry Hull plays scientist Dr. Wilfred Glendon, who gets a werewolf bite while he is searching for a bizarre rare plant in Tibet (which looks strangely like Southern California). He starts transforming at night and tries to kill the thing he loves most, in this case his wife (played by seventeen-year-old British actress Valeria Hobson, who played Elizabeth in ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" that same year). The blooms of the rare plant are the only thing that can stop the transformation, but a mysterious Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland, most famous for playing Dr. Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan, even though he's Swedish) tries to steal the flower buds for his own purposes. Hull hams up his part too much, and the continuous 'comedy' involving drunk old British ladies gets annoying very quickly. Oland and Hobson, however, are quite good in their roles. Originally Bela Lugosi was attached to play Dr. Yogami, but Oland brings a subtlety to the part that is genuinely creepy -- especially since everyone else goes over the top. The werewolf makeup is subdued because Hull didn't want his features too obscured, but makeup wizard Jack Pierce did a nice job at giving Hull wolfish features. This is, however, an incredibly polite werewolf: he never forgets to put on a hat, coat, and scarf before he goes on one of his rampages!
""She-Wolf of London,"" is dull, dull, dull...and not much of a horror film at all. Supposedly taking place in London at the turn of the century (or so the title card tells us), the design looks fairly modern and many of the actors have not the slightest trace of an English accent (""WereWolf of London"" got that right at least). The ending is also a terrible cheat that defeats the whole point of watching the movie in the first place. The story follows heiress Phyllis Allenby (June Lockhart, of TV's ""Lassie"" and ""Lost in Space""), who wished to marry Barry Lanfield (Don Porter), but believes she is the victim of a family curse that turns her into a murdering werewolf at night. When corpses start piling up, Phyllis thinks she is responsible. There are no makeup effects, scares, action, or even attempts at comedy in this film; it trudges along like a boring parlor drama. Even at 61 minutes, it takes too long to get through. The only interesting aspect of this film is it gives viewers a chance to see a true B-programmer from the 1940s. Few of these movies ever make it DVD, and I'm surprised this one did.
Werewolf fans and Universal horror buffs will want to see this disc. Casual viewers might find some entertainment in ""WereWolf of London,"" but probably won't make it through ""She-Wolf of London""...but even Universal horror nuts will find this film slow going.",1087430400,19,3767,4.9152276295133435
1621667,5,B00005LC4O,"These two films could not be more different, and both are unmistakably distinct from the Universal werewolf films starring Lon Chaney, Jr., as the afflicted Larry Talbot, yet I think they both work marvelously.  Many fans don't care for them, especially She-Wolf in London, but I find both films equally compelling.  They differ significantly from the storyline running through Chaney's later Wolf Man films, but these two films have a great deal of their own to offer fans.  Often overlooked and unduly dismissed by some reviewers and horror fans, these are two classic werewolf films.
Werewolf of London (1935) is actually Universal's first werewolf film - The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney, Jr., would come six years later.  In Werewolf of London, botanist Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) sees his troubles begin in - of all places - Tibet, where he travels in search of the ""Marifasa Lupina,"" a special flower that blooms only in moonlight.  He gets his flower, but he also gets a nasty bite from a werewolf in the process.  Back home in London, the flower takes on new meaning when a certain Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland) pays him a visit and expresses his own interest in the plant.  Glendon doesn't believe Yogami's wild tales about werewolves - not until, that is, he turns into one that very night.
This isn't your ordinary werewolf.  After his transformation, Glendon goes looking for a bloom of the flower (which, while not a cure for his affliction, would prevent him from killing those he loves the most) and then, before heading out into the streets, stops to put on his coat, hat, and scarf.  The actual transformations, several of which are shown in the film, are rather impressive for such an early film.  He's not overly hairy, but there is a definite look of evil intelligence in his eyes.
Of course, you have to have a leading lady in this type of film, and that role is filled quite well by the lovely Valerie Hobson.  Warner Oland gives a memorable performance as Yogami, but I must lavish special attention on three older ladies.  Spring Byington is quite a hoot as Glendon's rich lush of an aunt, but Ethel Griffies and Zeffie Tilbury absolutely steal the show as Mrs. Whack and Mrs. Moncaster.  These two ladies deliver a comic tour de force as inebriated best friends who take a great interest in Glendon when he comes asking to rent a room from one of them.  Back in the old days, movie studios (or more likely, censors) didn't think audiences could withstand all of the frights and chills of a harmless monster movie like this without a few stiff doses of comedy thrown in to the mix - oftentimes, such comic relief failed miserably, but here it is spot on.
Despite the fact that Glendon is as unsympathetic a character as you can find (the antithesis of Lon Chaney, Jr.'s Larry Talbot), I have to give this movie five stars.  The plot has a level of complexity to it that adds to its impact, the makeup and special effects are quite impressive, and the film has that unidentifiable something that a good horror movie must have in order to succeed.  Werewolf of London isn't as entertaining as Universal's Wolf Man films of the 1940s, but it is definitely worth watching.
She-Wolf of London (1946) rekindles the old traditional horror spirit by recasting the werewolf legend in a framework of psychology and suspense.  Most of the comments I read about this movie tend to give the whole idea of the film away, and that's a shame.  I went into the movie with no preconceptions, and while I was able to figure out what was going on about halfway through, the film kept me guessing until the very end as to the exact details of the story.
Phyllis Allenby (June Lockhart) should be a happy young lady; she is well off financially and engaged to be married to the man she loves.  Unfortunately, though, the ""Allenby curse"" casts a shadow on her future and supposedly led to the early deaths of her parents.  A series of vicious murders in a nearby park points to a big dog or, as one Scotland Yard detective hypothesizes, a werewolf as the culprit.  Phyllis awakens one morning to find her shoes muddied and her hands bloodied; when she then hears, at breakfast, that a child was killed during the night, she is sure that the Allenby curse has finally struck her and made her into a she-wolf.  She tries to hide herself away in her house, but her fianc&eacute;e can only stay away so long before he demands the explanation he deserves.  The story does a masterful job of building suspense and keeping the ultimate truth about the chronicled events a mystery.
Many fans find this film rather boring, but I thought it was a wonderfully crafted and very enjoyable film.  By 1946, audiences had already seen Henry Hull and Lon Chaney, Jr., transform into werewolves on several occasions, and it was nice to break away from that mold momentarily.  You don't have to show the audience the actual horrors on the screen in order to make an effective horror movie; without a bunch of special effects to fall back on, such a film requires a tight and efficient script, convincing performances by the players, and the manufacture of an increasingly suspenseful atmosphere.  She-Wolf of London fits the bill perfectly.",1086307200,12,5217,4.699231613611416
1621668,2,B00005LC4O,"Werewolf of London/She-Wolf of London is a classic black and white duo. I'm a big fan of werewolf films so, it was nice to see where it all started. Werewolf of London was the better film. She-wolf was quite simply: a. too short, and b: not a monster movie.
While I liked the feature, (Werewolf of London ), the film doesn't have much re-watch value. I mean, how many times can you watch the transformation scenes? Also, the 'hero' was rather unlikable. This film would be different if he cooperated with the other scientist and searched for a cure, instead of being a so selfishly boneheaded.
I recommend these films for old monster movie buffs. But for me, I just forced myself to finish it.",1069372800,5,693,4.552
1621669,3,B00005LC4O,"Both of these films certainly deserved to see the light of day on DVD.  The better of the two ""Werewolf of London"" was made in the thirties and was Universal's first attempt at a ""werewolf"" film (at least as a ""talkie"").  The second ""She-Wolf of London"" was made much later and although it features a nice turn by June Lockhart, used the ""Werewolf"" legend in order to heighten the suspense of what is basically a mystery thriller.
 A far better choice would have been to release ""Werewolf of London"" on its own or to pair it with ""House of Dracula"" from 1945, aka ""The Wolfman's Cure"".  This was Universals last attempt at the ""Monster Genre"" and oddly enough it remains unreleased on DVD (I have the VHS and Laserdisc) even though it stars Lon Chaney, Jr. as the wolfman.  It would have made more sense to have both Universal's ""Werewolves"" on a double-feature.  The paucity of reviews here and the fact that this release went out of print in less than a year speaks volumes.  Hopefully, Universal will get it right the next time around.

1621670,5,B00005LC4O,"I like this more than the 1941 Chaney classic. Although that one has it's merits like better transformation scenes, ""Werewolf of London"" has a charm not found in ""The Wolf Man"". Perhaps it's because it was the first film to tackle a werewolf story and attempt to explain the werewolf mystique in literate terms. It's a fun film regardless. Henry Hull is a botanist bitten by a strange creature while on expedition in Tibet. Back in London, he is warned by a strange fellow scientist that he's doomed. A moonflower is the key to each man's problems and Hull is cultivating it in his laboratory. The other scientist (Warner Oland of Charlie Chan fame) desperately wants it as he is the creature who bit Hull in Tibet. He suffers the curse of the werewolf and now Hull will suffer too. The moonflower is the antidote/cure. Soon Hull is becoming a wolf-man and stalking London under the full moon. Hull's wife (Valerie Hobson) is perplexed by his personality changes and seeks solace with an old boyfriend. But she, too, will be threatened as the werewolf always seeks to kill the thing it loves best. Spring Byington is wonderful as dizzy socialite ""Miss Ettie Coombes"" a friend of Hobson's who sees the creature and believes it's the devil come to claim her for her ""sins"". Two boarding house crones also add vignettes when Hull tries to hide out from the moon. One, Ethel Griffies, was years later the bird specialist in the diner scene in Hitchcock's ""The Birds""!!! The ""Werewolf of London"" shows it's age but is still a cornerstone in horror films and a delightful forerunner of things to come. This is a classic.",1036454400,18,1614,4.706713780918728
