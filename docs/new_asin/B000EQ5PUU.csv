2528663,5,B000EQ5PUU,"Wow where do you begin?  Macgyver, greatest character ever?  YES.  An honest, brave, and all around good guy... It's like Q from Bond saving the world when James is on vacation.  A little campy at times but that doesn't take away from the family valued action show.",1155859200,6,265,4.574468085106383
2528664,5,B000EQ5PUU,I love Macgyver and now that season 6 is out I can't wait to own the last season.  With no commercial it is every Macgyver fan's dream come true.  A great buy you won't be let down.,1154995200,3,181,3.864864864864865
2528665,4,B000EQ5PUU,"After the let down that was Season 5, I was in two minds as to whether or not to buy Season 6, but to keep the whole set complete, I did. Well, Season 6 was much better! The episodes are more action orientated, and less of the eco-guf that dominated Season 5. However whilst this was a pretty good Season, there was no Jack Dalton in any of the episodes.

All in all, I would give this Season 8/10 (4*)",1154131200,8,402,4.025
2528666,5,B000EQ5PUU,"Super!  As much if not more fun than the original - no commercials!  So many big stars have had parts in this series at the start of their careers it's amazing!  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!",1153958400,2,182,4.294117647058823

2528668,5,B000EQ5PUU,"I'm a big MacGyver and Stargate fan, also a big fan of Richard Dean Anderson. I highly recommend this box set of dvds. I love all the MacGyver episodes when they first aired. They were great, and was glad they put them out on dvd. I only wish they could have had some ""special features"" like behind the scenes, some out takes, etc, commentaries, etc. That would have been great! But since they didn't put anything on those I still enjoy watching the episodes. Looking forward to getting season 7 when it comes out in October and the Two MacGyver movies as well. :-)All the best.

2528669,5,B000EQ5PUU,"I'm thankful that unlike the Simpsons and other series that are being released painfully slow, that there is a new Mac season about once every 4 months. Seasons 5 and 6 were the best two of the show, but here's hoping that the two Mac movies will be released with season 7 since it was shortened after the show was cancelled. With the talented writers we have today it would be awesome to bring back Mac for one more season and a whole new series of missions.",1141948800,13,459,4.287356321839081
2528670,4,B000EQ5PUU,"Season 6 had soe of the best episode in the entire series. However season 6 is when MacGyver began to reach it's peak. Some of the scenes of MacGyver started to become very obvious and cliched. But despite all of that, MacGyver stayed true to it's format.

I used to watch it in the late 80s and early 90s when t aired on t.v. Angus ""Mac"" MacGyver  (Richard Dean Anderson), who works for the Phoenix Foundation, is a one man rescue team that uses creative and interesting ways to turn the table in his favor. His made-in-the-field defensive weapons and bad guy stopping apparatus' are very clever. I obviously like some episodes more than others but overall I highly recommend this series!!!",1483833600,2,560,4.77319587628866

2528781,5,B000EQ5PUU,The writers have done a great job with interesting story lines and relationships.  The ecological research conducted by the Phoenix Foundation is a rich source of story lines that also educate the public.  Mac is a hero with a conscience that considers the ethics of his decisions.  Great role model.  His quirky friends - and relationship with Pete (Actor Dana Elcar  was actually going blind in real life ) was genuine on and off screen.,1470009600,2,439,4.8

2529088,3,B000EQ5PUU,"My family loves and enjoys MacGyver so much.  This season, however, was a rollercoaster ride of good and bad episodes.  It seemed like every other episode was a save the environment episode and that it didn't stay true to what makes MacGyver such a classic and lovable tv show...MacGyverisms.

Don't get me wrong; there were a number of great episodes. But the moments of constant we need to save this piece of land and oh, I hate my dad, but by the end of the episode it's all...I'm sorry you were just misunderstood...  Some of it was too unrealistic and left me feeling unsatisfied.

Perhaps after six seasons Macgyver has lost it's initial appeal for me or maybe the writers just wanted to make a political statement.  Either way it was sometimes painful to watch some of the episodes in this season.

Overall: If you're a MacGyver fan get this to complete your collection, but don't hold your breath.",1325980800,4,905,4.654088050314465

2529113,5,B000EQ5PUU,"Simply put ""Macgyver"" is the best tv show ever! The sixth season does not disappoint. By this time Magyver is already established and we know what to expect. The sixth season does not have as many Magyverism. Magyverisms meaning making things with a Swiss Army knife and duct tape. In fact, I don't think you see him us duct tape at all. But the focus here is on the story.

These stories each have meaningful messages whether it be the dangers of pesticides, dangers of alcohol, or the dangers of glaucoma. And just as important the stories engage the viewer. If the stories weren't interesting the messages would be lost.

Why did Macgyver end in season 7 and was season 6 just the series maturing and about to end? I don't think the series had to end. I have read some fan fiction about Macgyver, and it is full of new ideas. For instance one fan fiction explains Murdoc always surviving because he was an immortal. It was a cross over from ""Highlander"". And yes, Murdoc is back in season 6. If you are a fan you know Murdoc episodes are always good.

So as the series winds down there is still some great episodes. But did Richard Dean Anderson (who plays Macgyver) know how to do any of the things Macgyver does? My guess is that he knows more than he admits.

 Also there is rumors on the Web about a possible movie. How true that is I don't know.

So you see even though the tv show ended, there is still much fascination with the show through fans. That is through their fiction and over the Web. If you are the least bit interested in Macgyver, you should get seasons 1 through 7. And if your younger and are new to Macgvyer, there is no show like it on tv today.",1224460800,3,1672,4.325878594249201

2529116,5,B000EQ5PUU,"Macgyver really did a lot of changing over the years, and I liked how it changed from him being a sort of super secret agent, to doing more serious kind of work with the environment. I loved the early episodes, but I found it took a year or two for the episodes to get really good. The addition of the Murdoc character I think was the start of where the show took off for me. It's what really captured my interest. I mean what show out there had an unarmed man that could get out of pretty much any situation with whatever he had with him in the room, like Duct Tape, or a paper clip, or whatever?

This show was definitely one of a kind. I do kind of miss the early days of the show because those little ways he would get out of danger really defined the show, and it seemed like they wanted to back away from those things in the later seasons. I think the stories got way better in this season. For Instance, the episode called The Visitors, which is about Aliens. It's a really good episode, and shows you how a hoax can be made, etc. I really liked it a lot. My favourite episode in this season was the return of Murdoc in the 3rd last episode. I always love when he comes back.

The only complaint I have about the later seasons of Macgyver was the fact that it was shot in Canada, I think they used a lot of Canadian producers, etc and it really made the show look low budget, from the camera shots to the way the show was shot. It didn't look as good as in the early seasons.

But I will judge the set by the episodes, and all that only, and say that this set deserves 5 stars. It's definitely worth watching, and buying.",1197763200,2,1628,4.09717868338558

8113038,5,B000EQ5PUU,"I just finished watching the whole set from season 1 through 7. I enjoyed every show--some more than others, obviously. I watched this show when it was on but I missed a lot. His humanity, integrity, loyalty and non-judgmental attitude toward everyone he met were missed the first time around. I was so fascinated then with all the improvisations and action. Now that I am older and less impressed by that kind of show, I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing him as a person I greatly admire. The main complaint I have is that his son was introduced in the last episode, where we didn't get to know him. I have been a fan of Richard Dean Anderson since he was on General Hospital right up through Stargate SG-1 that I watched religiously. His character showed through on all of the above.",1525046400,,782,4.553191489361702
