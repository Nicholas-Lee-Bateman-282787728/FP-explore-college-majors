7915447,3,B00002AFVD,"Dagwood starts to drive and gets into trouble. He hits a police car, and his car was reported stolen. The police lock him up. [Then the credits roll.] The family lives in a large middle-class house but there are financial issues. Poor Dagwood is always running late! He doesn't miss the mailman this time. Did mailmen deliver that early? [The value of the dollar was much, much greater then.] Dagwood wants a raise, his spending isn't controlled. J.C. Dithers gives him a chance to sell to an important client. The film has its funny parts, but some of its humor is dated. At the hotel Dagwood strikes up a conversation with a stranger (who happens to be the Hazlip he is waiting to see).

The home scenes tell about life in those days, as seen by Hollywood. Parents worry about the epidemic of mumps. The newspaper story about Hazlip's cancelled project leads to Dagwood being fired. His wife is suspicious about his activities. After an old boyfriend drops by there is big trouble for Dagwood. Dagwood asks C.P. Hazlip to explain things to Blondie. But more trouble happens accidentally. The hearing in court settles their problems. Hazlip agrees to do business with Dagwood, who is rehired and gets a bonus too. Blondie shows her wisdom here. Is it harder to care for a husband than a child?

This film shows what entertained people in the late 1930s during the Great Depression. Their problems there were often the same as today. This was the beginning of a series that lasted until 1950. There is a political undertone to this picture. Dagwood is presented as a hapless irresponsible man even though he holds a white collar job for a company where he is not related to the owner or management. Such attacks on fathers would continue on television. It seems that Dagwood did not need a driver's license to operate a car, however shocking that may seem today.",1186790400,,1862,4.708588957055214
