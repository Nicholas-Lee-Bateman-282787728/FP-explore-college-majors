5244558,5,B0092QU0YY,"Awesome series.  If you grew up with Zelda games like I did, you owe it to yourself to watch this.",1355270400,,98,3.9
5244559,5,B0092QU0YY,"This is a series that I regularly return to for some great laughs.  If you played the original Legend of Zelda, you will crack up at all the parodies, and the ""embellishments"" that fill in some of the gaps of the story, necessary or otherwise.  You'll learn how the faerie heals Link, and more about Moblin anatomy than you ever wanted to know.

I felt that the first 3 or so episodes of Season 1 start out fairly rough, but the series quickly gains steam and the production quality improves significantly.  Don't let the juvenile intro turn you off; as long as you're still okay with dirty humor, it will get better--much better.

You'll see a lot of familiar actors from The Guild and some other web series / podcasts (with many great performances), but TLoN has its own unique brand of humor.  I'm not sure how women will react to the misogynist humor (really -- women serve pretty much one purpose in the series), but it's clearly done from Average Joe Neil's perspective.

I feel that younger audiences will really enjoy this series, but immature adults in their 30's such as myself will get the most out of it.  The references are really tailored toward that demographic.

I definitely recommend this series, but make sure to keep watching through the first four episodes or so when it really gets legs.

5244560,4,B0092QU0YY,"I ordered this the other day because I have been eagerly awaiting its release on DVD. While not the highest quality show in terms of budget, you'll find lots of laughs to be had with it otherwise. I've only seen the first couple of seasons, so the third season does have me interested in what I have missed. The first season, while short, has some of the most hilarious sequences between old school Zelda characters that I've ever seen. Even though most of this show is based around the original Legend of Zelda game on the NES, don't be afraid if you've never played the game. This show is entertaining enough to please fans of all kinds.

The second season was a little bit of a letdown to me. Yes it retains the same actors and the same progressing story (not to mention a higher budget), but I was expecting them to get a lot more mileage out of the 9 or 10 dungeons Link explores in the original LoZ. Unfortunately, a lot of these dungeons are ""skipped over"" in short, montage-like sequences. This isn't to say that the laughs are decreased as a result, but it's almost like the creators wanted to move onto something else, which is why I'm surprised this includes a third season.

Overall though, this is a group of people you definitely want to support. Not only is this an amusing web series, but you've got the talents of fun actors like Felicia Day lending their talents here. I would like to see more from these guys, which is why I'm supporting this release. And even if you're not sure about it, head over to their website and check out the videos online. Trust me, by the end of the first season you'll be hooked.",1354492800,,1627,4.42

5244608,5,B0092QU0YY,"Brilliant. Everything compiled and ready to go instead of crappy internet versions, out of order and redirected.  If you enjoyed the original Zelda game (especially as a depraved teen) and want to see how other depraved kids viewed this game turned ""real"", look no further. Felicia Day as a perverted sex-crazed fairy... how can you resist that?",1442275200,,345,5.052631578947368

5244637,4,B0092QU0YY,"No need to be a ""Legend of Zelda"" fan to enjoy this web show.  The show makes fun of the commmon game conventions (quests, puzzles, end of level battles etc.) which can found in many of the games of this era, so thats why you don't need to be a ""Zelda"" fan.  The raw language, suggestive sexual themes, really makes this one for the adults.

My personal highlight is the appearance of Felicia day as a ""sexed up fairy"" who helps our hero in his quest to win the princess.",1426723200,,471,4.211111111111111

5244639,5,B0092QU0YY,Glad I finally found a place to buy this. I looked for it at the church and the lake but it turns out those aren't places where you buy things.

there is n upside, no downside (you'll get that joke later if you watch) but you have to see it to believe it, its just incredible and its sad when the final episode comes in and there are no more to watch. don't waste your time hunting it at dvd markets, buy it directly through amazon while it's still there.

5244705,5,B0092QU0YY,"The show is hilarious.  I was disappointed that the series wasn't available in Blu-ray, but this DVD upconverts beautifully.  The special features and other hidden gems on the DVD are well worth the price of admission.",1389139200,,218,5.027777777777778
5244706,5,B0092QU0YY,"The Legend of Neil starts off with a small budget, and it shows, but there are some good jokes to be had throughout the short first season. But the show really starts to get into its stride by season 2. In fact the mot surprising thing is that Neil actually goes through some character development during season 3. It's a great stupid net series to check out, it has a lot of heart and charm, and Zelda fans should get a real kick out of it.",1389052800,,441,4.1395348837209305

5244708,5,B0092QU0YY,This is a great chapter in the history of spoof comedy. I fanatically tracked this series while it was being put out on the web at effinfunny.com and salivated for every new episode. The complete series on dvd is a treasure.

5244709,5,B0092QU0YY,"Oh, another predictable Nintendo parody.  I was so skeptical when my friend recommended this to me but this show is side-splittingly hilarious.  It's not JUST Zelda references and jokes that everyone else has already made - lots of great original humor.  The references they DO make are quite obscure, hardcore Zelda fans will appreciate it.

I was so blown away by the genius of last episode that I actually clapped at the end.",1383696000,,428,4.821917808219178

5244721,5,B0092QU0YY,"Much of the humor may be lost on those who didn't spend most of 1986 playing Nintendo's classic ""The Legend of Zelda"" -- but for those who remember the game, this is inspired, laugh-till-you-hurt entertainment.  The cheesy low-budget sets worried me for a minute, but they fit perfectly with the spirit of this spoof.
Find some gaming buddies who haven't seen it yet and re-watch -- there are great visual gags you don't notice the first time through.",1381708800,,451,4.782051282051282

5244723,5,B0092QU0YY,"The Legend of Neil is one of the most incredible series to come out for free on the internet ever.  Though I'd seen all of it online when it was being released free to the public, I'd love to see more like this get made, so I spent the money to get the full series in high quality.  I've laughed so hard I cried when watching this series.  This series was obviously made by someone who loved the original Legend Of Zelda video game, as it continues to tell the whole store of the game through the series, as seen through the eyes of Neil, and it's very clearly a work of love.  Spend the money, buy the show, and you won't be disappointed.",1379289600,,639,4.129032258064516
5244724,5,B0092QU0YY,"The team of Tony Janning (Actor), Felicia Day (Actor), and Sandeep Parikh (Director) are back together again!

The premise is that Tony, playing a slacker & gamer, is magically transported to Herule, the Land of Zelda.

There is a tremendous amount of geeky humor and clear, tongue in cheek ad libing.

It was cool to see Sandeep's creative hand at bringing the characters inhabiting Herule to life.

The series pokes loving fun at the various denizens for all the contrived (and highly neurotic) reasons that that might have been in their positions for Link to attack in the Zelda series.

Tony as Link also lampoons the benefactors of Link for providing help in the way of substandard, crappy wooden and limited use ties when they clearly could do more if they chose to do so.

One caveat, this is adult humor.  So, if you are a gaming mom or dad, every scene of every episode might not be appropriate for the youngsters.

Well done!

In service,

5244771,5,B0092QU0YY,"The show itself is hilarious, and it's great to have it available in a higher-quality video version. The problem is that it is a collection of each episode complete with the original theme song intro and end credits; this gets kind of obnoxious when watching the whole series.

Other online series (including one that Sandeep is in) cut around all this, and I really wish there was an option for seamless playback.
It's still worth it if you love the series.

Edit: In response to Sandeep's comment I removed an insult to him that was in my original review. I also bumped my rating up a star because I really do love this series, warts and all.

However, the series is a great tribute to the original NES game, a must have for any 30 year old gamer who has a pulse and has nostalgia for the classics such as myself.",1355356800,,482,4.127659574468085

5244777,5,B0092QU0YY,"I fell in love with this show when it was just a single ""short"" on YouTube back in 2007. It hits a great balance of nostalgia, love for the source material, and its own brand of irreverent humor that should appeal to anyone with a fondness of parodies. I'm a huge fan of the original NES game and with each episode I found myself happily wondering what quirks they would exploit, remaining more or less faithful to the game's storyline while crafting an entertaining story of their own. Neil's adventure follows the game's arc but throws in plenty of hilarious obstacles and unexpected turns that keep the series original in its own right.

This show sets the benchmark for what you can accomplish with passion and talent.  Throughout the three seasons you can see the creators' artistic voices evolve and mature, culminating in a fantastic finale that satisfies in every respect, and will make you marvel at the fact that this was ""just"" a web series.",1355270400,,952,4.728915662650603
5244778,4,B0092QU0YY,"I must say that, as someone with strong feelings about the Gender Binary and Feminism, this show comes up short. Bechdel Test fail, non-existent feminist text, more than a few anti-feminist insults, and a great deal of gender stereotyping. Neil being a jerk is something I could accept, but the fact that the show seems to ask the audience to root for this jerk, feel his pain, and celebrate his triumphs is something that just doesn't sit well with me. I have difficulty connecting to any of the characters. However, this is a comedy, and connecting with the characters isn't a necessary element for being able to enjoy the show. Its weaknesses in terms of socio-politcal context are just one aspect of it.

I find it very easy to simply shut off my brain and really enjoy this show. I've watched the series four times through in the past four days (twice regularly, and once for each commentary track). It is a very funny, very enjoyable, very effective parody of the Zelda games (with specific focus on the first one...though fans of any game in the series will recognize most of the elements). The writers, cast, and crew provide an excellent fantasy world with a special low-budget charm. The humor is often crude, but effective. The narrative and mythos are fairly rich for a comedy. Even watching Neil progress from a spineless jerk, to a jerk with a backbone is something of an interesting journey.

The series thrives on jokes about the Zelda video game, as well as other pop culture references. While it is not a 100% perfect clone of Zelda One, it comes remarkably close. Some changes are made to keep the show in the ""parody zone"" and avoid lawsuits; others are made simply to accomodate the fact that it is, after all, a low-budget web show. Eagle-eyed viewers will note that a ninth piece to the Triforce of Wisdom has been added - in a unique and somewhat humorous way. Additionally, the rings are removed; Neil's tunic changes when he acquires the swords instead. However, viewers who have experience with Zelda One should find this series highly entertaining. Even viewers who have only experienced some of the later Zelda titles (this was me during Legend of Neil's orignal run on the web) will find plenty of things to enjoy. Realistically, anyone who's into fantasy, gaming, or comedy, can probably find something to like.

Legend of Neil has an often-compelling, continuity-based narrative and a very immersive universe. The show is great at recreating the feeling of playing through the game, while adding all sorts of elements that couldn't have been achieved in the simplistic 8-bit adventure. Comedy is the primary focus, but the mythos is rich, the characters have clear motivation, and the serialized narrative serves very effective storytelling functions.

This series isn't for everyone, but it does provide great entertainment. If you're thinking about it, check out an episode or two online. (Anything from 2x02 through 2x04 is good for getting a sense of the show.) If you like what you see, then the DVD should be a worthwhile purchase.

To those who are already Legend of Neil fans, this is a no-brainer. All three seasons, with two commentary tracks, and a plethora of bonus features. The 8-Bit Love music video, gag reel, and behind the scenes footage are all great, in addition to other features and even a few little easter eggs. Neil lovers will be sure to enjoy this DVD.

In spite of my own issues with certain aspects of the series, I still feel that this purchase was worth every penny. I'm happy to support creative web content and Legend of Neil is a fine example of how much potential a web series can have.",1355270400,,3653,4.781299524564184
5244779,5,B0092QU0YY,Stumbled across this one day after watching The Guild. Being a fan of Zelda and also the guild I had a good feeling. It is excellent and I found myself anxiously awaiting the new episode every week. It is hilarious and the cameos by Felicia Day are especially funny.  Highly recommend to any Zelda fan or comedy fan,1355270400,,315,4.431034482758621
5244780,5,B0092QU0YY,"As a fellow webisode and sketch comedy writer, The Legend of Neil, along with Felicia Day's The Guild are constant sources of inspiration.  For the casual viewer or spastic fanboy or girl it's purely excellent hilarity.  Also, the musical episode was just a stroke of shocking comedy genius.

Highly recommended for anyone with even the barest fairy dusting of a sense of humor.",1355270400,,378,4.968253968253968

8534819,4,B0092QU0YY,"This is a great amateur made series I enjoyed years ago when you could watch it free on its own website. These days the episodes are hard to find online so I bought the DVD so I could enjoy and share it with friends for years to come.

The series is excellent and by itself I would give it 5 stars, but the DVD could have been improved. So I gave it 4 stars.

The DVD is of the same quality as the original streaming videos were. Which is okay, but not great. On a large screen you will notice the video quality is not as good as a normal DVD. Also each ""episode"" is only 5 to 10 minutes and each one has an intro and credits. So a significant amount of the total run-time is seeing the same credits over and over again.",1512172800,,720,3.9586206896551723

If you do that, you are showing your support directly, and they also offer autographed editions. That being said, I was a major fan of this when it was airing way back when. I had to pick up the DVD when I found out that there was one. This is highly recommended for the aged Zelda fan.
