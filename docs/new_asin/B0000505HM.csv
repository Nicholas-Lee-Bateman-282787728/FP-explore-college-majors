1384833,5,B0000505HM,"The oldest member of Queen, Freddie Mercury was also the most important member of the group. He gave the band its name and largely its sound, wrote most of thier songs (including hits) and was a born leader for Queen. Although mainly a balledeer in Queen Mercury was a guitarist in his first band before turning to the piano and singing more. Queens first two albums featured some distinctivly aggressive material written by Freddie and he always performed Crazy Little Thing Called Love with a guitar as leftovers from his guitar days. Besides those though he wrote mainly balleds in a sometimes fun but often dramatic style and this continued into his solo career captured here in many music videos. This collection also includes visual material from Freddies last live performance ever. Diagnosed with aids he never performed live again to preserve his strengh and health as much as possible.",1102982400,9,895,4.973333333333334
1384834,5,B0000505HM,"Ok This Man, Mr. Freddie Mercury, is..was..and always will Be the most Talented and Creative Individual To ever exist. I Just received my DVD today and I am on my 2nd time of watching it! It's Incredible ! This Man Is amazing ! The Best Money I have ever spent (besides on his other things I have) Everything in these videos is unreal. The way that he can sing and look as if he's singin right to U! Amazing !!!!!

1384835,5,B0000505HM,"This DVD demonstrates Freddie Mercury's artistic talent as well as his musical talent.  He seemed to really enjoy each performance, and the audience can see he was a perfectionist.  It's an excellent addition to any Queen fan's DVD collection.",1049673600,15,243,5.205128205128205
1384836,4,B0000505HM,"GREAT TALENT!
Not to be repeated... SHAME he left us...
This dvd just shows his pure class...the track in my defence is a fitting song to end this dvd... god bless you FREDDIE...
thanks for leaving us with a great reminder of your talent..",1016668800,13,239,4.454545454545454
1384837,5,B0000505HM,"This compilation of Freddie Mercury's ""solo"" efforts is a true celebration!  Songs and music videos on GRAND scale, from the exquisite performances with Montserrrat to the daring and notorious ""Living On My Own,"" anyone who truly appreciates the joy an artist shares with people will never tire of this DVD.
The muck that MTV/VH1 tries to pass off as music videos is a crime, and it's more a crime that the videos on this DVD were largely ignored in the United States.  These are what music videos are all about: sound and vision...and care.  Freddie had a lot to do with the concept of each video, and never once do they overpower the music itself.  Rather, the concepts accent the music.  This is evident in the detail that went into recreations of past Queen and solo video sets to put together ""The Great Pretender"" (both video versions included), and the sets and costumes for masses of extras in every production.
As director David Mallet said, this was ""Freddie being Freddie"" and wow, Freddie was a wealth of ideas and talent. I found myself feeling very touched by the end of viewing this collection, and when the personal moments during ""In My Defence"" and the extended version of ""The Great Pretender"" were shown, I couldn't help but get a bit teary-eyed.  Just seeing the faces on the extras in ""Time"" were priceless--these people loved Freddie immensely and I'll bet an experience they'll cherish forever.
""Living On My Own"" was, as the CBS record company claimed, banned from US television due to the ""perceived promiscuity""--I saw right through that load of bull immediately.  Why is it okay  that so many rock videos are saturated with ""fantasy lesbian"" sequences but showing the sheer joyous fun of ""Living On My Own"" is not?  Because showing moustached and bearded men dancing together, many in leather, is somehow threatening (still) to people, or actually, straight men to whom the media feels we must make feel comfortable about what they watch.  It's a fact a party (which this music video was) with a gay atmosphere is more honest and liberated than what you see on those advertisements for ""wild party girls"" college events...here, friends and fellow Queen members show what having a good time is all about!
The live performances with Montserrat show the true appreciation  the world has had for Freddie Mercury.  Seeing all those people cheering and the performers obvious delight in participating is overwhelming to see and hear.
As director Mallet also said, ""Freddie was one of the really great originals of the second half of the 20th century.  There was nobody like Freddie.  There was no-one even a bit like Freddie.  There was just nobody like him at all.""  Bravo!!!!!
Even if you weren't a big fan of Freddie Mercury or even Queen, this compilation will have a positive effect on you.  I've never seen anything quite like this!",984441600,112,2860,4.851851851851852
1384838,5,B0000505HM,"If your a fan this DVD a was worth the wait. Freddie's talents are very veristal in this video, from is opra dueo to his Living on his own. This collection is so good I would give it 10 Stars! You wqont be disapointed.",981244800,12,218,3.977272727272727

1384841,5,B0000505HM,"This is a superb collection of Freddie Mercury's solo videos. The audio has been remastered for Dolby Digital 5.1 reproduction and the quality is excellent. The image is O.K. since these are relatively old videos. Freddie has become a legend, and reissuing his material helps to keep the legend alive. If you are a Freddie Mercury fan, this is a must have!",978998400,6,356,4.758064516129032
1384842,5,B0000505HM,"For once in history, a disc is released on R2 before R1, hence I've had this for about a month !  This is without a doubt a superb collection and is a must for any Freddie Mercury fan.  It has all his singles on it, including the live performances from the Barcelona Album.  With each video is a commentary from the director which is a nice addition.  The only down side of this is that is shows how poor the rest of the Queen DVD catalogue is.  Remembering that Freddie was a pioneer of new ways of presenting his music, I'm sure that he would be desperate to use the DVD format to its full.  I can only hope that this excellent release is the way that Hollywood/EMI records are going to procede and release the massive video and live collection of Queen that exists.",978048000,6,768,4.2620689655172415

My only complaint would be that for $83.00, I would have loved to have had more than 11 songs (2 of which are played twice; different versions).  But I'm very happy with this dvd because it has the best of Freddie,  including 3 duets with Monserrat Cabaille:  those alone are priceless to me.",1405728000,,362,4.59375

7928710,5,B0000505HM,"I watch and enjoy Freddie's solo videos (wish there were more) almost everyday!  Each time is like the first time - it leaves me ""breathless""!  This collection is my very best ""seek and find"" - of all things Freddie. My absolute favorite track by far is, ""HOW CAN I GO ON""!~!~ What a magnificent talent - what a generous and loving person - most of all, what a man!!!

YES, I said it and I mean just that.  There is NO DENYING in his defense, that he suffered much loneliness and unhappiness for his art. He may have been a Daffodil, but he sure as hell was NO shrinking Violet! He stood tall, (and in his own words) ""made his stand"" in the middle of life's road weathering all the storms thrust at him and (still) he did it His WAY. He told the truth, admitted his mistakes, he thanked GOD and FANS for his fortune - looked death in the face and said I'm ready, bring it on. His story is such an inspiration that I can't tell you how much it moves me, so - you see, I must have my dose of Freddie everyday and this video collection is my primary source.

Unfortunately, Freddie was twenty years ahead of his time.  If he were alive today and was at the age when the Queen Band began - I have NO DOUBT that with his GOD-given talents, his gorgeous good looks, the most POWERFUL voice ever and with his SEXY, SEXY bod-dey, he would be a multi-billionaire, and even more adored in his public life (regardless of the media's hate for him) - -  especially and extremely H-A-P-P-Y in his private life (gay or otherwise)!  I still love you, Mr. Mercury, Mr. Fahrenheit - YOU ARE A LEGEND (as you predicted). RIP!!!",1388620800,2,1608,4.266447368421052
7928711,5,B0000505HM,"For fans of Queen and Freddie Mercury, this is a must have in your collection.
To hear Freddie perform classic opera is amazing!  Another testament to his incredible voice and vocal range and power.
There is also a lot of info about his life with commentary from friends and other performers.",1388448000,,292,4.7254901960784315
7928712,5,B0000505HM,These solos are truly entertaining and wonderful in seeing and hearingjust what a phenomenal talent Freddie mercury was. Creative and charismatic and born to be and do exactly what you see and hear. One note. This is all you get besides interviews with the directors. If you get lover of life singer of songs video set you get this and a lot more for the price but these solos are very special to serious collectors or any fan wanting to see just how versatile and creative Freddie mercury was. The fact that he gave so much at the ending of his time here is incredible and so brave. I am a true die never fan who expects to meet Freddie mercury and queen in heaven.,1306627200,,666,4.336
7928713,5,B0000505HM,"Don't get me wrong I love You Tube.  It's there that I found Freddie's awesome talents.  Having the videos for yourself is the best thing ever.  Freddie and Montserratt are fabulous of course.  And I really needn't say that this operatic presentation is delicious, but I truly wish there were more.
The producers here speak very frankly of Freddie that will put a warm smile to your face.
I have sampled thru YouTube other Opera efforts and came away feeling that none can match the beauty of Freddie Mercury's words and music.

Oh and please do your self a great favor by getting the DVD of Lover of Live and Singer of Songs if you like Freddie, you will love this compilation.",1251590400,4,678,4.524590163934426

Who would have thought he could write an opera, let alone sing alongside one of the great opera divas.  Freddie is so connected to his music, and brings you along for the ride...",1232928000,,334,4.354838709677419
