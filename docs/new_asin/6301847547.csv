The only redeeming quality in this mess, was the natural beauty of Katherine Barrese. She looked like a decent actress too (if she had something to work with), and her talent was completely wasted here; not to mention a great actor like Malcolm McDowell who was as lifeless as the script!

In ""Jezebel's Kiss"" (from 1990), young and beautiful 'Jezebel' (Katherine Barrese) returns to the small coastal-town of her childhood, where she is haunted by memories from her past and some unfinished business. That, pretty much sums it all up.

In typical Hollywood/stateside fashion, if things weren't confusing and meaningless enough with the awful plot and script, they had to throw more abuse on poor 'Jezebel', by having her raped/sleep with all the leading male characters in the story. The rest of the supporting cast (......more like zombies......), all seemed to be equally ""sleep walking"" through this experience. Everything about this movie is awful: from the horrible and cheesy music, to the typical flat-lighting style of the worse video productions of the 80's/90's.

This ""turkey"", surprisingly enough, is now a collector's item, mainly because there was gratuitous nudity and sex-scenes involving Katherine Barrese. Now, what I don't understand is, how come this lovely actress never got a real break? That goes to show you just how treacherous the ""movie business"" can be!

The DVD picture quality is very good, however the audio seemed to go in and out in some parts. PAL format, English (no subtitles), FFN, NR 93 mins.

7816004,4,6301847547,"I discovered this film on late night premium cable. It was a nice surprise, not just for Katherine Barrese's beauty. It had a good storyline and acting. I don't know why we haven't see more of Barrese, considering this was made in 1990.
It's a story of revenge. Barrese's character is a young woman who drifts into a small town, gets a job at the local diner, and draws the attention of the community's men, several of whom she sleeps with then discards. This is all part of her plan, rooted in past tragedy.",1044921600,7,508,4.414893617021277
7816005,3,6301847547,"This movie isn't an Oscar candidate. Its argument is poor, and the trama is ambiguous. There are many flashbacks, and it's hard to find out their meanings. But, Katherine Barrese, a new actress, makes a good character,  and I think she has a future in movies with bigger budget and better  content, taking advantage of her histrionic capacity.",923961600,2,343,4.896551724137931
