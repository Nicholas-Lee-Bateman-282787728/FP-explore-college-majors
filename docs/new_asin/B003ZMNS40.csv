8410692,4,B003ZMNS40,"Joan Bennett at her best and Walter Pigeon at his suavist.  Who could ask for anything more, I ask you?",1379030400,,103,4.15
8410693,3,B003ZMNS40,"I saw this movie with my parents when it came out & I was 5 years old. It made an impact on my childish mind & I have wanted to see it again. Much of it is 2nd rate in quality & dialogue but it's still worthwhile seeing, especially I suppose for Joan Bennett.",1372118400,,259,3.814814814814815
8410694,3,B003ZMNS40,"Archie Mayo's 'The House Across the Bay' (1940) starts out as a watchable, by-the-numbers George Raft/Lloyd Nolan gangster picture with Joan Bennett in tow as the nightclub singer/moll, then sort of sputters plot-wise and finally emerges as a prison-wives-centered love-triangle-cum-love-square affair with gentleman aviation engineer Walter Pigeon and double-dealing lawyer Nolan accounting for the geometric reconfiguration.  If that summary comes across as labored, trust me, it's duly representative of the film, an independent Walter Wanger production that delivers some fine performances of a diffuse screenplay seemingly cobbled together by a stable of writers tasked with conflicting assignments.  Not a total stinker, but a few too many changes of dramatic course in 86 minutes to distinguish it as anything special in either the crime or romantic arena.  2 1/2 stars.",1370563200,3,877,5.782945736434108
