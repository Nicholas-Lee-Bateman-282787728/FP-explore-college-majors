8197354,5,B000QU3JXE,"the world is split in two communities.. the privileged ones who have seen the epic Gunda... and the have-nots who.. well.. have not... today i crossed over from being a have-not to the other side of the fence.. I just saw the movie and i think words are not enough to describe the magnificience that is Gunda... simply amazing.. just simply amazing.. the class, the eloquence, the literary abilities of all the caste members, the twists and the turns, the magnificient sets (check out the 'Latakta Circus') .. ohh just marvellous..

If you haven't watched Gunda, kiss goodbye to your chances of going to heaven..",1184371200,,612,4.828571428571428
