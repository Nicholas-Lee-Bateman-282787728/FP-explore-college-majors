5837771,4,B00DNRAGSS,"This is a ""must see"" if you saw The Gathering.  It very nicely carries on the story about this family who lost their Father two years ago.  Maureen is perfect as the Mother and widow.  Effrem Zimbalist plays her love interest exactly right.  My husband was bored by it, but I always enjoy a movie where people are interacting.  So ---women - yes,  men- no.",1394928000,3,356,4.4
5837772,5,B00DNRAGSS,It was a very heartwarming movie! I enjoyed it very much! I recommend to all who likes Family movies! Great movie for all family members to watch!,1391644800,,146,4.444444444444445
5837773,4,B00DNRAGSS,"I have the First Gathering. So excited to have part 2,enjoyed looking at it over the Christmas Holidays. Thanks again",1389916800,,117,4.9
5837774,3,B00DNRAGSS,I had watched the original Gathering the year it came out and enjoyed it so much.  Was very disappointed with acting and the scenery had changed so much in this second one.,1388102400,,172,4.375
5837775,5,B00DNRAGSS,The Gathering part 2 was  a continuation of the original.  It gives you an idea of that took place after the death of Adam Thornton.  Typical of the way the children would react to their mother and another man its good acting by all cast members.  It was realistic and believable with some light moments and some very dramatic ones as well.  I would recommend it if you have seen the original with Ed Asner....,1388102400,,410,4.413333333333333
5837776,3,B00DNRAGSS,"Not nearly as good as part 1, but still acceptable holiday entertainment.  After all, this is Maureen Stapleton....what more could you ask for?",1387411200,,143,5.217391304347826
5837777,1,B00DNRAGSS,"A really unnecessary sequel that loses credibility in a hurry. ""The Gathering"" (originally an ""ABC Movie of the Week"" presentation) was one of the most touching films ever made, where the viewer was made to really feel like part of the Thornton family and friends and both sad and joyful at the same time. It was well-written and so well-cast and acted that it's impossible to imagine anyone else among its veterans and future stars in the roles. Hanna-Barbera (the producers) should have left well-enough alone and hung up the phone when NBC wanted to cash in on its success with a sequel. ""The Gathering, Part II"" is contrived with all of the worst soap opera clichs imaginable about the whining family complaining about the mother's new possible romantic interest. The new cast replacements have no chemistry whatsoever with returning cast. I am sure many viewers were always curious at the end of ""The Gathering"" what the next Thornton Christmas family gathering would be like without family patriarch Adam. To those who have not seen Part II: Continue to leave it to your imagination. There is nothing about a warm family Christmas gathering in this film. Even the appeal and charm of Maureen Stapleton and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (whose daughter, Stephanie, was in the original and skipped this one) can't save this one.",1384387200,21,1323,4.937219730941704
5837778,1,B00DNRAGSS,"found this gem listed in the dvd coming soon horror category.
can't believe how horrible this movie made me feel. if you liked the halloween remakes, you'll just hate this. even rock god rob zombie & da wife wouldn't remake this!",1379980800,,229,4.609756097560975

5837780,4,B00DNRAGSS,Was disappointed that all the original actors weren't in it.,1453248000,,60,5.1
5837781,3,B00DNRAGSS,"We wanted this to complete the set even after reading all the reviews stating the many changes and differences with the characters and setting (house etc.).  While ""The Gathering"" is one that we watch many times during the holidays, this sequel will only be pulled out as a last resort when all the others have been watched.  It's a good movie to play in the background while you are doing other things like cooking, wrapping presents, decorating the tree, etc.  Like I said - it completes the series but doesn't fall in the ""must watch again"" category.",1453248000,2,553,4.680412371134021
