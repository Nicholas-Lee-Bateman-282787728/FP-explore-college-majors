8116554,1,B000F2CA88,"Perhaps the worst documentary ever made. Inaccurate, and poorly done.",1519344000,,69,6.0
8116555,2,B000F2CA88,"I liked the goofy format of this ""sort of"" documentary, I knew there was no Queen music.  But there were too many errors. I've read several Queen/Freddie books in the past 2 months, and there were ridiculous mistakes. This one comes to mind... that Freddie's last video was ""I'm going slightly mad.""  WRONG.  The last one was ""These are the Days of Our Lives.""  Easily confirmed.  And there were others.  Don't buy it.",1397347200,,418,4.657534246575342
8116556,1,B000F2CA88,"I rented this from Netflix and thank goodness I didn't even pay a buck at Redbox. I will watch anything about Queen or Freddie Mercury. Well this, this absolutely stunk. I mean, just horrrible.  There is a narrator who clearly is bored out of his mind with his job. Then there are mostly just views and pics of modern England.  That's about it!  Oh and a hideous sketch of the band, very few pics of them, and that's about it. In my opinion, do not buy this, even if you are a hardcore fan. Ive read biographies about Freddie, watched lots of videos and docs, this..ohmygosh..nothing to do with Queen.",1294358400,,601,4.445454545454545
8116557,1,B000F2CA88,"I can not belive this is legal. Put Freddie on the cover, amd don't have him or Queens music on the DVD. I am very dissapointed",1187136000,5,127,3.923076923076923
8116558,4,B000F2CA88,"I don't agree with the negative reviews that have been posted here. Ok, granted - there is no actual footage of the band or performances, etc. But, this is clearly stated in the info posted. READ PEOPLE!

What you do find here are interesting facts and stories that are fun! Frankly, at this price you can't expect a Ken Burns type of documentary. It comes from a fan's perspective which is actually refreshing for a change. Some great footage of locales from the early years of the band, funny acedotes and the like.

All in all, the purists expecting the definitive biography of the band won't find it here... but I personally really enjoyed watching this program and plan on getting and watching the others too.",1150934400,2,714,4.658730158730159
8116559,5,B000F2CA88,"This is a great documentary... and you can't beat the price! Very informative, a lot of stuff I didn't know about Queen that I think is very interesting. Not sure why people are thinking there is Queen music on here, since the Description states that there isn't any included...strictly a documentary.",1149552000,3,301,4.921568627450981
8116560,1,B000F2CA88,"This dvd isn't worth the disc that it is burned on.  It has no actual footage of the band, hardly any actual photos and the worst part about it is that they used these horrible ""drawings"" of each band member throughout the dvd. The dvd was narrated by Liam ""thinks he's funny when he's not"" Dale. Good grief. Couldn't they get anyone better for one of the best bands ever formed? I stopped watching after 5 minutes and even that was too long.  That means I paid $1.40 for each minute??? What a waste. I want my money back.",1149552000,11,522,4.262626262626263
8116561,1,B000F2CA88,"Utter rubbish.  People, no matter how much you love the band, do not waste your money on this amateurish effort.  Not one interview with the band, their family, or friends is used.  Not one Queen song is played.  No clips of the band in concert or otherwise, is used, nor are any clips of the band's videos.  Only three or four actual photos of the band are used (more photos of David Bowie are used than of Queen!).  Instead, pencil sketches of the indvidual band members are featured (and featured ad nauseum).  These sketches are so bad as to be laughable.  When the sketches aren't used, we're treated to video of various areas in England that have significance to what's being discussed (Wembley Stadium during the Live Aid portion, for example).  In too many instances, all that's onscreen is a drum kit with stage lights flashing on it, or just closeups of the stage lights themselves. In many stretches, video of the narrarator clad in black leather riding his motorcycle are used instead of anything actually related to the band.  The facts that are presented are well-known retreads already known by anyone even remotely interested in the band, and some of their ""facts"" are dead wrong.  The narrator states that Freddie says, ""I still love you"" at the end of the video for ""I'm Going Slightly Mad,"" when it's actually at the end of the video for ""These Are The Days Of Our Lives"".  It is astounding that work of such little effort was deemed worthy enough to release on DVD.  I adore this band and was hoping to stumble across some clip of an interview I hadn't seen before or learn something new about them.  Thankfully I'd only rented this DVD and even in that, I would love to be able to get back my rental fee and hour spent watching this trash.  If I could give this zero stars, I would.",1146960000,18,1803,4.538699690402477
