7836610,2,6303082084,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  Helen Mirren is a big favorite of mine.  This is a BBC production, normally a sign to me that some artistic quality has been produced into the movie. It just shows that nobody is perfect.  Contrary to the ""Editorial Review"" this movie will not keep you guessing at all.  It may make you groan, though.  There are no twists and turns except for one near the end of the movie and it is fleeting at best.  You know a mystery has problems when the action takes place almost constantly during heavy rain, darkness, and deafening thunder.

Mirren plays Annie Marsh, a less than happy housewife who has been hospitalized for post-natal depression in the past. She like everyone else in her area is concerned and afraid of a serial killer, the Hawk, who is using a hammer to kill and sexually assault women with two children. It just so happens that Annie has two children.  It just so happens that the Marsh family hammer keeps disappearing just when Annie seems to need it.  Quite a twist and turn.

Her husband, Stephen is a creep, played by a bug-eyed George Costigan.  Stephen spends a lot of time away from home for which he can never quite account. Annie gets suspicious of these coincidences and tries to figure out whether Stephen's absences match up with the timeline of the Hawk murders.  Hmmm.

Stephen and Annie have been married for years but quite incredibly Stephen has never taken her to the neighborhood pub where he hangs out.  One night, out of the blue and suspicion, Annie insists that he do so.  He does.  She meets a hooker (with two children, of course) and the hooker ends up dead soon thereafter.  Hmmm.  A real mystery, alright.  Where was mysterious George at the time?

This movie is not good enough to be shown on PBS.  Maybe that is why it was released as a movie. No viewer should have to pay for it, though. Catch a different BBC import on public TV.  At least it will be free, and you won't be stuck with a DVD that you can't even donate to your local library without feeling guiltier than the Hawk.",1335571200,3,2066,4.482573726541555
7836611,4,6303082084,"A woman who was once institutionalized starts to suspect his husband may be a serial killer. Is she right or on the contrary these suppositions are simply vapors from her fantasy?

Helen Mirren demonstrates once more why she has achieved that coveted status cult as actress.

Totally recommended.",1152576000,,296,5.145833333333333
