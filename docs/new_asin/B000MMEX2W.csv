8425451,3,B000MMEX2W,"Pretty decent spaghetti western. Ive seen over 250 and this is in the middle rating for story , acting etc. Good performance by Fajardo as the lead villain. Basically man comes back to town to right a conviction 10 years before, and finds town held hostage by the bad guys. If you can find it on dvd, its worth the purchase.",1323129600,,324,4.327868852459017
