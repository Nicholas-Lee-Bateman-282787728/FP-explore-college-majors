7974981,4,B00007CVRN,"Well-produced performance that confirms the influence of Herbie Hancock within the Hip Hop realm. While not my favorite form of the many types of music in which Hancock is so skilled, this DVD definitely deserves a place among his many signature performances -- whether as a leader or soloist or member of a larger ensemble. What can be said of him, except that he is no less than a contemporary cultural treasure? (Bring on da funk!)",1437609600,,434,4.723684210526316
7974982,5,B00007CVRN,"Excellent,Herbie relevant in the contemporary jazz music world. Good value",1404086400,,74,6.5
7974983,5,B00007CVRN,"What more can I say....Herbie & his crew (who are fantastic by the way) just let the music take over on this dvd. With Terri Lynn on drums, Herbie's grooves are expressed with true emotion. The rest of the supporting cast are extremley talented in their fields of study and don't mind showing it! DJ Disk was introduced to me via Primus and has grown into an incredible DJ. The bass, keys, and ex-Gloden Gloves horn just fuel the fire....an absolute must own for any Herbie fan as well as any fan of a great live musical performance....get it!!",1235606400,2,544,4.505050505050505
7974984,3,B00007CVRN,"The only reason I gave this three stars is because of the good quality of the music and the opportunity to see the original ""Rockit"" video.  Based on the quality of the DVD imagery I would give it a one.  Is there anyone else who finds this DVD to be low-quality and grainy (especially the ""Rockit"" video), or did I get some kind of bootleg?",1162771200,,341,4.230769230769231
7974985,1,B00007CVRN,"Being a big fan of jazz and Herbie I looked forward to my first viewing of future2future.  However I was unpleasantly surprised. I agree with what's already been said that the DJ was entirely unnecessary. He persisted with irritating hues and shrieks that only took away from the music. It was like watching the twilight zone while listening to a jazz solo. Furthermore Herbie's little speeches only inspired impatience: ""Knowledge is the future""- ok man thanks for that. I appreciate the search for a new sound etc but not when its dragging good musicians behind the cart. If you like ""weird"", this might be for you but it wasn't for me.  If you want to hear/see Herbie on a great set check out Dejohnette, Hancock, Holland, Metheny in concert live at the mellon jazz festival. Or listen to Directions in Music one of Herbie's  more recent collaborations.",1158624000,2,856,4.809523809523809
7974986,5,B00007CVRN,"I picked this up initially to check out Matt Garrison the young bass player on this DVD.  I was blown away by the whole band and especially Terri Lynne Carrington dam she is a monster on the drums.  Wallace Roney is fantastic.  I invited friends over to check it out and they are ordering copies now.

Herbie is continues the Mile Davis tradition of always experimenting and discovering great young talent like Matt Garrision.  Great music, excellent audio and video even multiple camera angles.  In the extra they include the original 1982 video of Rockit then the 2002 version.

Definately a DVD musicians and Jazz fans need in their collection.",1143331200,4,647,4.827272727272727
7974987,4,B00007CVRN,"Hmmm... lukewarm reviews posted here notwithstanding, I find this DVD very good. I've owned this for about a year and have watched it dozens of times and still get a lot of enjoyment from it. The DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio sound excellent as far as I'm concerned, and the performance is great too. I dunno, I like the funkified sound this lineup presents myself so I guess it's a matter of personal taste rather than an issue of musical absolutes. Yeah, there's a few weak moments but overall these guys (and gal) shine. The drummer by the way is Teri Lyne Carrington, not whoever was mentioned in one of these reviews. The drums sound crisp and tight, choice of kit rather than any sound mixing bias.

The video editing is pretty good. At least you get to see whoever is soloing for the most part rather than having to watch extended close-ups of a performers face or other non relevant item. The light show going on in the background is interesting too.

The extras include the original 'Rockit' video (remember that from the early MTV days?) and an interview with Herbie that's somewhat unmemorable.

I'm glad this is in my collection and hope potential viewers won't be turned away from this DVD because of the critical remarks of my fellow reviewers though I respect their opinions.

IMO this DVD is well worth getting.",1130889600,3,1321,4.632478632478633
7974988,5,B00007CVRN,"This DVD is of a great gig by Hancock and this band.  The line-up of somewhat lesser known musicians (currently) is actually a great showcase of these up and coming talents.  Hancock shows he is the master of the past, present and the future.  I would love to see more of this kind of thing.",1046217600,7,291,4.254545454545455
7974989,5,B00007CVRN,"This Herbie Hancock concert video takes off from his recent FUTURE 2 FUTURE album, with 5.1 surround + DTS sound and multi-angle video options.  Not only does F2FL have everything that I like about Herbie, but it pretty much personalizes the musical approach of his former employer Miles Davis, too.  By that I mean, first you have an impressive collection of distinctive musicians, including trumpeter Wallace Roney, bassist Matthew Garrison (son of Coltrane bassist Jimmy), drummer Terri Lyne Carrington (who might have been Miles' last drummer if Ricky Wellman didn't get there first), turntable wizard D J Disk (taking on the role of percussionist, among other things), and the fine second keyboardist Darrell Diaz.  Then you have an eclectic selection of tunes, including Hornets from SEXTANT (appropriately renamed Virtual Hornets), Chameleon from HEAD HUNTERS, Butterfly from THRUST, an almost unrecognizable Dolphin Dance from MAIDEN VOYAGE, Rockit from FUTURE SHOCK, and of course  a number of key cuts from the newest CD.
Finally, the elusive freedom-with-structure balance characteristic of many Miles and Herbie bands is often in evidence here, with fresh sonic textures and interesting solos that take chances without losing sight of the composition.  Perhaps ironically, Herbie solos mostly on acoustic piano and Roney plays predominantly with electronic enhancements.  Roney almost steals the show with a fine balance of long phrases and appropriate use of silence in-between them...he truly has arrived with his own style and is in no way a Miles clone, even if Davis' influence can be felt.  The concert starts out a bit slowly but within 10 minutes the group has hit its stride, keeping the viewer interested throughout the remainder of the 105m concert.  Highlighting the extras are Herbie talking about his sidepersons, plus the original 1983 videoclip for Rockit.  I know Herbie tends to bounce from project to project, but my wish is that he will find the time to work in this context again soon.  Maybe it's asking for too much but I'd love to see this group given the chance to reach its potential over a period of time ala Miles' and Herbie's best groups.  Herbie is one of the few left on the scene today who could do it.",1038787200,26,2247,5.0953678474114446
