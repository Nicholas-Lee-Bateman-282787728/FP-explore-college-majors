606698,5,6303251595,"Regardless of anyone's race or creed, this movie provides rare nourishment for the soul. With its message of love and hope contagious, Director Nierenberg fashions a touchingly human and uplifting portrait of gospel music that translates how this special music has sustained people through adversity. A humbling and glorious film.",1124668800,4,330,5.62
606699,5,6303251595,"If you're into Gospel Music (the older clasic type) and even if you're not, this is one of the most moving , informative, authentic documentaries I've ever see.  Maybe that's why it won an academy award when it was released.  I saw it then at the theatre, and later on video, and it's lost none of its power.  It took a European to make it, which is just more proof how little we as Americans care about what many consider the most influencial form of African- American music.",1070755200,7,476,4.386363636363637
606700,5,6303251595,"For those who have not yet goten a grip of the new strange stuff in the gospel scene, this is for you.  For those who have got all the latest music, this is for you too.  It shows the background of songs such as ""precious Lord"".  Also it goes on to show how the gospel music had to fight to be where it was int he early eigthies.  Thomas Dorsey is also a little entertainer and Willie Mae Ford Smith is definitely a minister for the truth whatever the cost.  Get it and you will not be disappointed",1026777600,8,498,4.040816326530612
606701,5,6303251595,"Years ago, I used to program a jazz show on a small radio station in southeastern Massachusetts.  Between 6AM-7AM, we used to have a gospel segment (which as an atheist, I found particularly amusing and interesting).  I came to really love the music.  It's some of the most emotional blues you'll ever hear.
""Say Amen, Somebody"" is more than just footage of a truly legendary gospel performance.  It's testimony to the power of the music and how it moves the people who sing it, play it, and listen to it.  Even this ""unbeliever"" was moved by what he saw.
I first caught this film in 1985 and I've seen it a couple of times since.  It never fails to suck me right in.",1018483200,12,667,4.382113821138211
606702,5,6303251595,"The best of the best and the greatest of the greatest gospel legends!  I stayed up until 3 am and did not want to stop watching!  The video took me back to my grandmother's church back home in Alabama.  They say that you can't go back but this is the next best thing.  My grandmother has gone on to heaven now, and eventhough she is not in the video it is almost like she is with me again.
Wonderful video.  Gets you back to the roots of true gospel music, singing because your soul is happy, and simple down home people who just want to give praise!",1005782400,16,550,4.102803738317757
606703,5,6303251595,"""Say Amen Somebody"" is about the celebration of life through Gospel music and what a joy it is. I have watched this movie countless times and each time I am moved to tears.
The love for God as expressed through the African American experience is the essence of Gospel music. When life became too large and oppressive Black folk always had Jesus and their cries of sorrow turned to joy in Gospel music.
I firmly believe that Gospel music is not only the roots for Soul and R&B, but it is also the cornerstone of American culture. Every aspect of literature, music, poetry and art has been profoundly influenced by Gospel music. This movie bears clear witness to that.
Watch or buy Say Amen Somebody and allow Thomas Doresy and Will Mae Ford to impart God's blessings upon you......",980985600,6,780,4.618705035971223
606704,5,6303251595,"I've seen this movie at least 5 times now.  Each time Thomas A. Dorsey brings tears to my eyes.  I have tears right now just thinking about it.
This movie isn't about selling videos or tickets.  This movie is about evangelism.  This movie is about making a joyful noise.  This movie is about the joy of being one with the lord.
Anyone who doesn't believe that the essence of the Holy Spirit can be captured on film will think again after this one.",979689600,7,447,4.337349397590361
606705,5,6303251595,"One of the most effective ways to learn, is through music.  This film is an excellent tool for teaching our children the 'History of Black Church Music'. Upon the recommendation of our Pastor, this film was shown at our  church. The young people were impressed with the level of participation  from the audience and the joy of those who sang. It's not to often that we  get the chance to view a film from which you can feel the joy and anointing  coming through the screen. This film is an absolute must for the music  department in every church.",962323200,6,546,4.4646464646464645

606707,5,6303251595,"Say Amen Somebody is inspirational as well as informative.  I now better understand the orgin of gospel music.  There was also a little humor in it.  Some of my favorite gospel singers where included such as the Barrett  Sisters and the Oneal Twins.  I watch the video at least three times each  day.  I salute Mr. George Nierenberg for a splendid directing job and  making it possible for me to obtain this video for my home use.  Also,  thanks to the surviving stars.",915408000,8,469,4.542168674698795

I am pretty certain I will be satified with the quality of the dvd I purchased based on my past dealings with shopping thru Amazon.com...I have purchased many dvd's, vhs tapes over the years and I have yet to get a faulty one.  Sometime my pics aren't exactly what I expected but that is my own fault. I ususally find someone who does like it and then it becomes theres. This has only happened one or two times..I have ordered dvd's for friends and they never complained. I am very happy working with the Amazon Family.",1315180800,,750,4.201388888888889

I love the old time religion. Most likely, I will be purchasing it on CD just to have. I do not want to pop my VHS. Aganin, I watch it every day and even at night before I go to bed. I must say it is a wonderful feeling when I can her or see someone who is sincere to God. Now, I am not a saint but I do strongly believe and it makes my heart feel good listening and seeing God spirit all over someone. For me that is good and positive energy that is strongly needed.

7841775,5,6303251595,"Touched and Inspired are the two definitions that ultimately sum up the experience and after feeling of watching `Say Amen, Somebody'. A need to be discovered documentary film detailing the rise and cultural embargo of Gospel music. A relative piece of Landmark history in Gospel music. Say Amen, Somebody takes the viewer on a journey of time to witness the great invention of Gospel music at its purest and finest, and be warned its Gospel music not quite as we think we know it today. This journey is led and narrated by Willie May Ford-Smith and Thomas A. Dorson the Two most significant connoisseurs of Gospel Music. Upon this embargo opinion and information of the time is also given by those who were fortunate enough to sideline the movement, of Willie Mae and Thomas, this magnificent duo can only be described as `True Patron Saints'!

If today's young people could only watch this great piece of history and connect with it for just a minute, things would be very different for them as a generation. I am committed to honesty in saying that if today's church were as tenacious and committed as Willie Mae Ford-Smith and Thomas A. Dorsey then the body of Christ and the church of this present day wouldn't be so divided!

The *minute film shows the paths that Gospel music had taken throughout central America starting in Chicago also the hometown of Willie Mae and Thomas, showing how the church of the time would not accept this new type of `blues singing music' called Gospel music, Thomas a spiritual Innovator and Willie Mae an Evangelist have dedicated their lives work to the insemination of Gospel music not only to be accepted into the church but also within main stream culture.

If you do not know Willie Mae Ford or Thomas A. Dorsoy then apparently you do not fully know Gospel music. We all know that you have to know the beginning in order to understand the origins and be able to foresee the future and fully understand a process. A must have for all true Gospel Music fans today",1178150400,,2004,4.671388101983003
