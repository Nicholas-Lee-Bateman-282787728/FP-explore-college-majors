1399352,3,B000056PNR,"I know when it comes to films I can be snobby sometimes, so it's a big admission when I confess Baby Mama was funnier than I expected and just endearingly dumb enough to make me smile even when I tried not to. It's very much like an extended Saturday Night Live skit ""the sweet goofy chick and the smart professional woman havin' a baby together"" brought over to the big screen, but it's also a very topical subject--I don't think this movie could have flown ten years ago---that should reach out to a lot of women. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are genuinely great comediennes who work well together and who brought out the best in what was sometimes flat material. But be warned,  THE HUMOR IS A BIT LOUD!!!! Baby Mama is a nice movie, though, and heck, even the guy I went to see it with laughed despite the fact he was at (gasp!) a chick flick.",1209081600,5,843,4.30188679245283
1399353,5,B000056PNR,Very funny movie. A must see. The cast was fantastic in this movie. I laughed from the time the movie started till the credits rolled. Tina and Amy have great chemistry and that made this movie enjoyable from start to finish.,1208995200,4,225,4.512195121951219
1399354,4,B000056PNR,"I just tried out this video and found the content to be perfect for what I needed!  I wanted some yoga work that would help keep my muscles flexible (especially since, in my 6th month now, I am having some back pain), but not be too challenging for one who's been away from yoga for awhile.  I like the fact that modifications are shown for poses that may be difficult for those of us who are less flexible or not as good at balance these days.  That said, the instructor's running commentary about the baby, not being able to see your toes, ""feeling the love you have for your baby,"" yada yada yada, was annoying on the first viewing and will only get to be more so the more I use the tape.  I'll probably be watching with the sound turned off, once I learn the poses.",1043020800,,769,4.210884353741497

1399356,5,B000056PNR,"I'm a novice at yoga, and purchased this video along with the ""Prenatal Yoga"" video.  Both are great.  The Prenatal Yoga video features more soothing music and relaxation techniques.  The Crunch video, however, offers more stretching moves and positions.  Women featured on the video are in all stages of pregnancy; and modified versions are explained with each exercise.  The instructor is more ""spunky"" than in the Prenatal Yoga video, perhaps appealing to a younger or more athletic crowd.  Depending on my mood for the day, determines which video I will watch.  Both are great and wonderful back-savers! A must-have for pregnant women!",989366400,,639,5.205882352941177
1399357,3,B000056PNR,"If you are looking for a solid prenatal yoga video, then this is it.  It goes through various prenatal yoga stretches, poses etc. at a steady pace.  But don't expect this to be a workout, especially if you were physically fit entering your pregnancy.  It also lacks the meditational/spiritual quality that some of us expect to be included in a yoga class.",987465600,,355,4.693548387096774
1399358,5,B000056PNR,"I love this video!  It is a very low, key stretching workout.  The instructor is sure to point out adaptations for each move and there is one mom demonstrating those adaptations.  The instructor is also very good at talking you thru and reminding you to use an adaptation or ease up if you're pushing too much.  She also makes the point that you will feel different every day and just to do as much as you can today.  I had bought another prenatal yoga tape that said it was for everyone, but it was very cardiovascular and too intense even in my early second trimester.  This one is excactly what I was looking for--some relaxing stretching to keep me in good shape for the delivery. You do not have to be a yoga expert or in super shape.  I truly see me using this tape every day for the rest of my pregnancy (I'm currently 5 months prego).",982108800,8,842,4.291139240506329

1399369,5,B000056PNR,"In ""Baby Mama"", you will see one of the best comedy-writing, and acting teams in Tina Fey (Kate) and Amy Poehler (Angie) portraying opposites attract... Eventually. Their first movie and possibly their best for comedic value; every other statement between these two or the ensemble cast filled with cameo roles are hysterical. Kate is a career woman who held off having a baby until later in life for furthering her career while a free-spirited and partying Angie just goes with the flow in life and is able to help out by carrying a baby for Kate as a surrogate. When a pregnant Angie winds up under the same roof as Kate, the laughs, mishaps, and fun begin. With Kate being so straight-laced and monetarily successful, Angie is completely fun loving and rebels against her opposite, stick in the mud, personality type. These two experience together how it is in the world for the other woman. Even though there may not be a lot of understanding of it at first, there is a lot of growing compassion between the pair. But could these two ever develop a friendship? It is a truly funny twisting turning unexpected roller coaster ride of estrogen on steroids. Make no mistake though, with this full cast of characters, the guys have you laughing just as much too. The relationships aren't only concerning women alone. Check out Steve Martin's role in this as I thought he was another side-splitter. I laughed through this whole film so I had to immediately watch it again to hear what I missed. It is still just as funny anytime I watch it...",1500681600,2,1540,4.686346863468635

1399413,3,B000056PNR,"Tina Fey and Amy Poehler can and have done really funny bits and I am sure they will do so in the future.  This one however does not hit the funny bone.  Writer/Director Michael McCullers made his reputation as a writer on SNL and with such broad comic efforts as the Austin Powers films The Spy who Shagged me and Goldmember.  You get the idea.  But the funny bits in Baby Mama just aren't all that funny.
  The central story has a career woman (Tina Fey) who works for a big chain of organic food stores wanting a child.  It turns out that she cannot  have children and that as a single woman she will go to the bottom of the list for adoption so she decides to hire a woman to carry her child.  Sound funny so far?  Sound more desperate and tragic?  Hummmm
  We always want to see Tina Fey act simply because she has such a powerful screen presence.  But writer McCullers doesn't give her many great lines, joke wise.  Amy Poehler can be hysterical and she does have a few good moments as the trailer trash woman hired to be a substitute mom.  Greg Kinnear has a supporting role as a good looking guy who catches the eye of the grocery exec.  He does fine and actually acts in a role that a lessor talent would simply walk through.  The plumb acting role goes to Steve Martin who savagely mocks the pretentious, precious vegan world as the owner of the grocery chain.  And Sigourney Weaver also shines as the owner of the baby clinic who seeks to help Tina Fey get a baby of her very own.  Watching these very skilled actors work, even in an average film, makes the effort worth while.  The actors are better than the material.
  But what does it matter what I think?  The film cost a modest $30 million to make and brought in a profitable $64 million.  The PG-13 rated film lasts for one hour and 39 minutes.  I keep waiting for a brilliantly written vehicle that will allow Tina Fey to really dazzle us.  This average film is not that one.",1471392000,,1944,4.2837465564738295

1399549,5,B000056PNR,"Baby Mama provokes belly laughs.

Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are today's reigning champs of a comedy tandem. From their works on Saturday Night Live to the Golden Globe Awards, every time I watch them, I end up rolling on the floor with deep, hoarse sounding belly laughs. They are funny. They are hysterical. They are hilarious. In the same vein as Abbott and Costello, the Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy, Fey and Poehler have that special comedy connection, combination that make them the best working team in comedy today.

I watched this movie ""Baby Mama"" for one reason only. Or I should say two reasons: Fey and Poehler. What a tandem! Just thinking about them, I laugh hours after the movie credits have rolled. They work so well together, seeing one, I expect to see the other.

This hilarious comedy sets off with Fey, a 37-year-old, corporate, career woman, wanting a baby. Due to biological reasons, she needs a surrogate mother . So she sets out to find one. After reviewing possibilities on the web, she turns her attention to a surrogate biz operated by Sigourney Weaver. Once they review the potential mothers, Poehler is picked to be the surrogate mother. Even though Poehler has her own life with a less than a highly, desirable boyfriend, she agrees to be the surrogate mother, and moves in to Fey's upscale, luxury apartment.

The plot is interesting. Yet the reason I watched this movie is simply because of Fey and Poehler.  I remember the days they appeared together on SNL, Saturday Night Live, and later on the Golden Globe Awards. Their timing together is immaculate. Just like the great comedy tandems of yesteryear. They are the first female comedy team to really take off. Throughout the history of TV and the Movies, it has always been male comedy teams like Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Abbott and Costello, and Laurel and Hardy. No more. Fey and Poehler re in sync, and are the hottest comedy team in show biz today..

Directed by Michael McCullers ""Baby Mama"" is a fun, comedy to watch. Why? Two reasons already stated. And it's not because of Abbott and Costello.

I think Fey and Poehler's contract to do the Golden Globes in 2016 still needs to be renewed. Nonetheless, I know something will happen to see them again. They are too hysterical to just disappear from the screen.",1441411200,,2314,4.727047146401985

In addition , she typically plays the role of witty boss or successful professional.  This movie pushed me into a ""dislike"" for Tina Fey.  After watching her career throughout the years it seems all to obvious that these character roles that she plays are the norm for her because this is her true life.  This movie makes it completely obvious what she thinks of men;  the only male roles in this movie are played by low intelligent men who are only concerned with sex.  Women always play the superior, smarter role, it would seem in most of her works.  She further pushes this concept by showing that all men are needed for are their sperm to father them children.

Now 37, she's finally determined to have a kid on her own. But her plan is thrown a curve ball after she discovers she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant. Undaunted, the driven Kate allows South Philly working girl Angie Ostrowiski to become her unlikely surrogate. Simple enough. After learning from the steely head of their surrogacy center that Angie is pregnant, Kate goes into precision nesting mode: reading childcare books, baby-proofing the apartment and researching top pre-schools. But the executive's well-organized strategy is turned upside down when her Baby Mama shows up at her doorstep with no place to live. An unstoppable force meets an immovable object as structured Kate tries to turn vibrant Angie into the perfect expectant mom. In a comic battle of wills, they will struggle their way through preparation for the baby's arrival. And in the middle of this tug-of-war, they'll discover two kinds of family: the one you're born to and the one you make. The cast led by Tina Fey (as Kate) and Amy Poehler (as Angie) is great!

So I started out with a Blu-Ray DVD; Bluy-Rays don't scratch easy as regular DVD's do. I got my package earlier then I had expected, which was a plus for me, (I was anxious to see my movie) because it makes me want to buy again knowing i won't have to wait 3 to 4 weeks to get a product.

Another plus for me was when I opened the package, mint condition was an overstatement. This thing looked like someone bought it, saw their movie, and returned it. Which I think is crazy, how do you not like baby mama.. LOL

It's possible that my discomfort with this movie results from exactly 0 other movies where I was torn between whether I related to the straight man (Fey) or the lovable loser (Poehler), because movies with two developed female characters still do not exist.

This movie does miss the dramatic balance between the two characters.  Our hero gets off the hook pretty completely for calling Poehler ""white trash"".  Yet Poehler is painted as the wrong kind of person for dyeing her hair while pregnant, having a messy fridge, and preferring the taste of soda to water nearly as much as for the way she misleads Fey's character.

But again, perhaps I'm just newly confused by something men grapple with in, oh, every other comedy ever made.  Perhaps men the world over are thinking, ""Man, why they gotta make Cartman look like such an idiot?  Doesn't everyone like cheesy poofs?""",1319328000,,962,4.759036144578313
1400444,4,B000056PNR,"Tina Fey really knows how to play against her looks in order to get laughs. In fact, the key to Fey's success is that she's a natural-born geek trapped in a beautiful woman's body. The characters she plays (including the one in ""30 Rock"") are invariably social klutzes who good-naturedly tolerate the absurdities and idiosyncrasies of the world around them. While in many ways she is an outcast from her society, she also appears more ""sane"" than many of the people who share a stage with her. As a result, she allows us to laugh at the weaknesses and absurdity of many of our fellow human beings without feeling superior to them.

In ""Baby Mama,"" she stars as Kate, a single, 37-year-old control freak whose biological clock has begun keeping her up at night. Cursed with a ""T-shaped uterus"" and rejected by one adoption agency after another, Kate turns to surrogacy as her only viable pathway to motherhood. Enter Angie, played by the equally brilliant Amy Poehler, a trash-talking, junk-food-eating but lovable slob who agrees to help Kate have the baby she's always wanted - for a price. Thus, these polar opposites march together into that nine-month-long period of heightened hormones known as pregnancy.

Written and directed by Michael McCullers, ""Baby Mama"" is a wonderful throwback to all those sturdily constructed screwball comedies of the past that draw their strength from clever dialogue, a series of humorous misunderstandings, and deftly executed slapstick routines, all put forth by true-blue, certified comics who really know the tricks of their trade. In addition to Fey and Poehlor, perhaps the two top comediennes working in the business today, there are fine contributions from the ageless Steve Martin as Kate's blissed-out New Age boss, who owns a chain of whole foods stores; Dax Shepard (""Parenthood"") as Angie's long term boyfriend; Greg Kinnear as Kate's anti-corporate love interest; Holland Taylor as Kate's hilariously outspoken and disapproving mom; Siguorney Weaver as the perpetually pregnant head of the surrogacy company Kate employs; and Romany Malco as a nosy doorman who isn't afraid to add his two-cents in when it comes to the events of Kate's life.

Clearly a product of people of talent, ""Baby Mama"" is a hilarious and endearing comedy that even manages to throw a bit of painless social commentary into the mix for good measure.",1314489600,2,2373,5.079487179487179

Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are talented actresses, but were very week in this movie. I only blame the director, who is normally in charge in getting the best out of the main characters. Also the post production have a quite few flaws in editing, by not removing extra frames, right after the director calls ""Action"". Steve Martin was a total waste, the producers could have saved some money by hiring someone new, who is starting his career. Some scenes are missing in the script, like for example a romantic and the same time funny episodes in bed, between Greg Kinnear and Tina Fey, where Greg is reaching for a protection and Fey reveals that no need to do so, since she can not get pregnant. It was a nice change to switch from action movies, (90% new releases today) to a comedy, that I miss so much.",1289692800,4,966,4.402234636871508
1400448,3,B000056PNR,"Given that stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are both very talented, one might expect that Baby Mama (2008) would be funnier, and more entertaining than it is.  There are some laughs, but no really big ones, in what is a moderately entertaining, tasteful, comedy with a warm romantic element, mainly due to Fey, and an understated and believable performance by Greg Kinnear.

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is thirty seven, lives in Philadelphia, and because her T shaped uterus is apparently an impediment to being able to conceive a child, she turns to a fertility clinic run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver), to find a surrogate mother.  Prospective mother Angie Ostrowski (Poehler) agrees to carry Kate's child, and after being artificially inseminated, apparently becomes pregnant.  Angie moves into Kate's apartment after splitting up with her common law husband Carl Loomis (Dax Shepard).  Rob Ackerman (Kinnear) the owner of a fruit smoothie establishment, begins a relationship with Kate, who keeps the surrogacy matter a secret, while she continues attending pregnancy classes with Angie.  Deception becomes the name of the game, as the scam Angie and Carl are running, becomes a court case.  Then it's baby time, as things end up happily ever after.

Written and directed by Michael McCullers (SNL), the screenplay seemingly targeted at women thirty and over, is smart, and mostly plays it safe, without getting too daring, edgy or vulgar.  The ""girls night out"" scene, is about as wild as it gets.  Produced by Lorne Michaels, the film is nothing like either SNL or Fey's 30 Rock.  Poehler and Fey are both great at what they do, and are great together.  There are some slightly weird characters, but only Kate's boss Barry, played by Steve Martin, even rises to the level of being slightly annoying.  Romany Malco is quite amusing as Oscar, the overly concerned doorman at Kate's building.  Maura Tierney (ER), and Holland Taylor (Two And a Half Men) are also in the cast.

Baby Mama isn't a laugh riot, but watching Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play off of each other is a good time, and there's just enough of the charming Mr. Kinnear to provide a nice romantic spark.  The film should strike an appropriate and humorously resonate note, with its intended audience.",1282435200,3,2268,4.976127320954907

It's a funny movie because the blonde-haired woman who was supposedly carrying the baby (Amy Poehler's character) kept acting like a child herself!  She'd eat so many chocolate cakes she'd end up making herself sick, she'd play the American Idol video game all day long, she'd pee in the bathroom sink, all because she was COMPLETELY uninterested in having a baby.

There's a bunch of twists to the storyline, and all of them managed to keep my interest.  Twists that concern which woman is actually pregnant, and who's the father.  No, this is NOT your typical chick flick with terrible acting bits involving ""who's the father- could it be that smiley pretty boy guy over there who's completely unfunny but thinks he's good looking?""  type of comedy.  Nah, Baby Mama is more interesting than that (the male characters are actually GOOD) and to be honest, guys out there watching the movie might find something appealing and humorous about Baby Mama too.

The movie also does a pretty good job going through lots of emotions.  Sometimes the characters are sad, sometimes happy, other times just confused and miserable, haha.  I guess that's what it's like when pregnant.

1400467,2,B000056PNR,"I've really enjoyed what little I've seen by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler -- mostly online recaps of their Election 2008 coverage, but still, it shows comic talent. So when I was home convalescing after knee surgery, we picked up their recent buddy film, Baby Mama, to pass a little time. Sadly, it seems they should have kept making hay of Sarah Palin's political inadequacies, because this film -- though rife with potential and boasting a fine supporting cast -- was 99 minutes I could have better spent contemplating the pain shooting down my leg.

Jokes fall flatter than Kate's seemingly infertile tummy. Stereotypes abound; blacks, gays and wiccans are among those who will probably be offended at one point or another. And the story keeps building to laughs that they movie just can't -- mind the pun -- deliver.

It's a shame, because I know Fey and Poehler can both do better. I also expected more from the supporting cast, which includes Greg Kinnear as an easygoing juice-monger and Kate's potential love interest, Sigourney Weaver as the mogul of a lucrative surrogate-mother enterprise and Steve Martin as a narcissistic health-food guru. Weaver and Martin pull off much of the genuine humor in this film, while Kinnear puts sincere effort into a fairly bland and thankless role.

Meanwhile, the two leads slog through material that seems like it should be funny but isn't. Given the people involved, I expected a smart, well-written comedy that offered some touching insights into society along the way. Instead, they went for cheap chuckles -- and failed to earn them.

The supporting cast is sort of waisted, especially Steve Martin, but frankly, this is Fey and Poehler's vehicle to drive and they drive it like a Ferrari.  There are several scenes that will make you laugh until it hurts, and the story itself works because Fey and Poehler are so likeable and you go with it, so to speak.  The fact that Poehler is actually a little old to be playing this part, makes it all the more funny.  If you are a fan of these two, then I can't imagine you not loving the movie, or if your just wanting a movie that will make you laugh.

1400470,4,B000056PNR,"In some ways this movie is completely ""by the numbers"": Two women, one a polished, driven careerist (Tina Fey) and the other a streetwise, rough-around-the-edges neighborhood gal (Amy Poehler), butt heads over a multitude of issues during the course of their forced alliance until each realizes she could learn a lot from the other.  But even though the basic idea is predictable, there are many funny scenes, a few surprises, and solid supporting turns by Greg Kinnear and Steve Martin, who's especially good as Tina's flaky, new age, yet enthusiastically capitalistic boss.  It was also nice to see a comedy where the women carry the movie and aren't just there to support the guys.  Though ""Baby Mama"" perhaps falls a little short of a must-see experience, it easily qualifies as perfectly good entertainmnet during an evening at home.

The DVD features a sharp, clean image, a handful of brief but interesting extra features (deleted scenes, interviews, behind-the-scenes stuff, you know the drill), and a commentary track featuring the cast and production people.  Oh, yes-- one of the special features is a clever alternate ending to the film.  I'm glad we got a chance to see it, but the producers made the right choice with the ending eventually chosen.  It was clever and ironic enough without the extra ""oooomph"" and complication of the alternate ending.  But again, it was fun to see other ideas that were considered.

1400471,4,B000056PNR,"I may be a little bias going into this, since I personally find Amy Poehler to be one of the funniest comedic actresses working today, but I honestly loved this movie.  My wife and I are huge fans of these two SNL girls, and so we were very anxious to see this movie, and I have to say that it did not fail to keep me entertained.  Yes, `Baby Mama' lived up to my every expectation; and while the film tries at times to be more than it needs to be it still manages to be every bit as funny as it claims to be.

The film tells us of single middle-aged Kate who is a successful businesswoman deprived of the life she's always wanted because she was so determined to get to the top before she started a family.  Now, she's well into her thirties and is feeling that sharp kick in her stomach where her unborn child should be.  Despite the fact that she is single and has no man in mind to father this child she decides that now is the best time to have that baby.  When adoption and artificial insemination prove themselves `not happening' she turns to Chaffee Bicknell and her surrogate service.

Enter Angie Ostrowiski.

Angie wants Kate to put her baby inside her, and so she does.  No sooner can Angie say ""I'm pregnant"" and Kate's world is tossed upside down when Angie shows up on her doorstep, homeless after a breakup with her common-law husband Carl.  Kate is at first excited and then devastated as she realizes that adjusting to Angie is possibly harder than adjusting to a newborn.

The film is hilarious from start to finish, thanks in large part to the undeniable chemistry between Poehler and Fey.  Both of them have different yet complimentary styles of comedy, and so they work so well with and off each other that they carry this film scene after scene.  But not only can they work off one another, but they work off the rest of the cast in various ways.  Fey's romantic relationship with Kinnear is not only believable, it is touching and sweet; and Poehler's knock down drag out relationship with Shepard is hilarious.  Fey also has a great vibe going with Steve Martin, who plays her eccentric boss Barry.  Fey understands how to play uncomfortable without being awkward.  Sigourney Weaver is priceless as Chaffee and Romany Malco has some very touching moments with Poehler.

Sure, the film tries at times to deliver a message and it doesn't quite manage to bring that message to fruition, but it doesn't really matter.  First and foremost this is a comedy, and as that it soars.  You might want to wear an extra pair of underwear for this one; because when it hits it hits hard.",1237852800,2,2598,4.475583864118896

The story is simple enough but every character is mined for maximum mirth, everyone from Tiny Fey's African American doorman seen calling his ""baby mama"" collect in the lobby (""'cause I don't have enough quarters to tell you how much I care for you"") to her soul-less mother who always manages to say the worst thing to her daughter (and the funniest thing) to Steve Martin as a clueless hippy boss who can turn any business decision into a daffy New Age exercise.  Sigourney Weaver also shows up at the most fertile menopausal woman in the world.

What I enjoyed about the movie is that the comedy isn't limited to the stereotypes of the poor and uneducated.  I think there were just as many laughs at the expense of Tina Fey's driven professional woman as there were for Amy Poehler's white trash surrogate.

Like I said, I'm not a good candidate for Chick Flicks.  The last one I thought was really interesting enough to hold my interest was Mel Gibson in WHAT WOMEN WANT--and how long ago was that?

A 30-something executive grows more and more desperate to have a baby. She eventually opts for the surrogate mother option, a choice that brings with it many light-hearted complications.

REVIEW
This is a broadly amusing comedy. The script is reasonably witty. The chemistry between the executive (Tina Fey) and the surrogate (Amy Poehler) is the main attraction here. Talented actors Sigourney Weaver, Greg Kinnear and Romany Malco are unfortunately wasted in unengaging supporting roles. An unbilled Steve Martin, however, does crack a smile here and there as Fey's lunatic boss.

If you're a fan of the TV show ""30 Rock"", don't get excited. Fey, one of today's most talented comedy writers, did not write or produce ""Baby Mama"".

I would recommend buying this DVD only if it fell below the US$7.00 mark. Perhaps then it can wait for a rainy day when you're in an undemanding mood and feel like a light comedy. And there's certainly no need to buy it on blu-ray.",1231459200,5,969,4.896341463414634

1400480,1,B000056PNR,"Not sure why I would think that a film called Baby Mama would be thoughtfully entertaining. I don't know. I guess was under the impression that Tina Fey is smart and witty (maybe she really can only make this work in television time) and BC graduate Amy Poehler can add a savvy spin to material. The film has a few chuckles but quickly steers itself straight into the safe funny zone. The stereotypically safe funny zone. You know women single and over 35 must be super successful ""career women"" and have given up on any sort of social life. All women want children. The whole infertility thing is just hysterical and so is pregnancy and giving birth, while we think of it. The jokes are so tired. And you've seen them before. I'm not a major fan of 30 Rock but I've enjoyed some of the episodes and thought Tina Fey might be a little different. She does make the successful single woman stylish at times on that show. Though even there you see the jokes from Alec Baldwin about her being a lesbian because she's wearing pants or because she's over 30 and single. Oh, it's OVER honey.

I like to think that I've been picky. I have a brain. I have a heart. I use both in making my decisions. Sure, sometimes I want a guy to be there for me all the time but why do I feel like a failure at times because there isn't one? I have never had any male friends say that they don't expect to meet anyone or that they've ""given up on dating."" No, it's only my girlfriends who have careers. The ones who have families have already had the boyfriend/husband. I've been doing what I want to do for the past decade and not had to decide what someone else thinks. Not everyone needs to be part of a couple or to have a family to be considered successful. Oh, I'm joking. Of course you have to check all those things off your list or you're a real loser. Who doesn't know that? I spend enough time in therapy. And I'm being so sarcastic, in case you didn't figure it out. Yet sadly our American society does think that these are the things a woman must do. She has to have the career, marriage and family or there's just something off, something wrong, something, oh horrors, different about her.",1231286400,5,2180,4.330073349633252
1400481,4,B000056PNR,"My daughter was home from college, celebrating her birthday over the holidays.  She asked me to pick up ""Baby Mama"" for the party.  I probably wouldn't have rented the movie otherwise.  Although I decided not to crash a party of giggling girls, I watched the film before I had to return it.  I'm glad I did.  At first, I wanted to roll my eyes in disdain with the low-brow humor like Angie Ostrowiski crouching in a sink to relieve herself.  But eventually, I found myself laughing out loud.

Saturday Night Live's Amy Poehler was the funny lady in this film.  As the uneducated crass Angie, Poehler pulled out all the stops.  Equally as wonderful was Tina Fey as Kate Holbrook who played Felix to Poehler's Oscar in this odd couple match.  After being named entertainer of the year for her Sarah Palin characterization + her Golden Globe & Screen Actors Guild award as Best Actress in a TV series for ""30 Rock,"" Fey plays a totally different woman, Kate Holbrook, the overly organized executive able to handle the strangest of bosses, Steve Martin's new age executive Barry.

Michael McCullers who was the screenwriter for ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" has his directorial debut with this film.  He lets the supporting characters shine.  Holland Taylor who has twice been nominated for Emmys for ""Two and a Half Men"" does a great job.

Greg Kinnear who was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar for ""As Good As It Gets"" back in 1997, plays the sympathetic boyfriend for Kate.  Sigourney Weaver who won Golden Globes for ""Gorillas in the Mist"" & ""Working Girl"" plays the fertility businesswoman Chaffee Bicknell with a cold-blooded focus.  Romany Malco does a great job as Oscar the bellboy, who gets in the middle of everybody's business.  John Hodgman who has been on the ""Daily Show"" & numerous personal computer commercials has a funny cameo as a fertility specialist.

The most hilarious cameo is Siobhan Fallon-Hogar as the speech-impaired birthing teacher.  While it's wrong to laugh at someone because of a disability, she plays the character with such conviction that I was hopelessly laughing in spite of myself.

""Baby Mama"" succeeds as a comedy because of its funny script, good pacing, enough sentiment to make you care & excellent performances.  Enjoy!",1231200000,2,2556,5.24384236453202
1400482,3,B000056PNR,"It is a bit of a commentary on how few good comedies there have been in the past couple of years that this is, bizarrely, one of the best comedies of 2008.  I'm tempted to chase a rabbit and ask precisely why Hollywood has gotten so bad at producing good comedies (though I suspect it has something to do with so many emulating the terrible comedies of the Apatow combine), but I'll instead say that while this is not at all a bad movie, it shouldn't have qualified as one of the best comedies of the year, though it did.  All in all this was a fun, enjoyable film.  It is just that there should have been many others as good or better.

I've seen over the years many of the Second City shows here in Chicago.  Although the shows I've seen have featured many, many men and women who have enjoyed a great deal of success in comedy, on TV, or on film, in fact I can remember only three performers from the shows I've attended.  First and foremost I remember Steve Carrell, especially his hysterical impersonation of Fabio.  Second, I remember Stephen Colbert.  Third, I remember Tina Fey.  Interestingly, while I remember well Tina Fey, I do not remember Amy Poehler, although I definitely saw her.  Still, it is great to see two of the people I saw together in a film, even if I remember only one of them.

This is good, but it isn't as good as Tina Fey's main gig these days, 30 ROCK.  There are some good moments in the film, but few great ones.  Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were persistently funny, and there was also some humorous moments featuring Steve Martin, but while the film was good, I kept thinking about how upsetting it was that there weren't better comedies this past year.  It all makes me wonder if 2008 wasn't one of the least funny years in the history of Hollywood.

2008 has, however, to go down as a great year for Tina Fey.  In addition to her success on BABY MAMA, Tina went from success to success thanks to 30 ROCK, which was clearly the best comedy on television, and has a host of awards to prove it.  She also won the Emmy for Best Actress.  But her most valuable public service might have been in permanently deflating the hopes of Sarah Palin to be taken seriously by the American people.  As one of the least substantial political figures in decades, Palin was extremely vulnerable to receiving her public comeuppance, but it was Fey who delivered it in the most devastating impersonation in recent (or for that matter distant) memory.  If America hadn't given up on Palin earlier, they surely did the second that Fey, as Palin, proclaimed ""Now it's time for some fancy pageant walking.""  How can Palin ever talk about foreign policy when Fey's words that ""I can see Russia from my house"" ring in our ears?  I don't remember a comedian single-handedly ending the political career of a politician so completely (and yes, Sarah Palin's career is over -- if ever she tries to run for anything above governor of Alaska, Tina Fey will just trot out some more parodies and take care of that).

So, while 2008 was definitely the year of Fey, it wasn't a great year for film comedy.  Nor was BABY MAMA the best place to see her strut her stuff.  That would either be her Palin impersonations on SNL (along with Amy Poehler's unforgettable rap alongside the real Palin when the latter declined).  Hopefully 2009 will show a rebound of the film comedy.  As things stand, BABY MAMA is unfortunately about as good as we have for 2008.",1230854400,,3456,4.470494417862839

Tina Fey doesn't quite top my list of Hollywood hotties (declares the pig in me). What turns me on about her is her smarts, her wit and her sense of humor. I've geeked on her since her days in SNL, all the way to 30 ROCK and now to her theatrical releases. And is it too kinky to admit that her Sarah Palin impressions render her even more attractive? (dammit, it's too kinky, isn't it?) BABY MAMA is Fey's likable second feature film (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002IQJ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls (Special Collector's Edition)</a>), and it floats on the strength of Tina Fey's talents and her odd couple chemistry with Amy Poehler, also from Saturday Night Live. But, since it does feature Tina Fey, I expected something edgier. Instead BABY MAMA gives us formula.

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a thriving, single career woman who, at the age of 37, suddenly gets the urge to have a baby. But when she finds out that she has a T-shaped uterus (apparently disastrous for conceiving), she resorts to a surrogate mother. Except that the baby mama the straight-laced Kate sets her eyes on is Angie (Poehler), a low income white trash girl. Uh oh. Then, it's just a matter of time before the film contrives a way to have Angie move in with Kate. Because we're about to venture into ""Oh, snap!"" territory.

After other films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-of-the-Bride-2/dp/6305803781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father of the Bride 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-with-Digital-Copy/dp/B0014CQNTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno (Two-Disc Special Edition with Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, BABY MAMA can't help but feel familiar, even if it does offer up a different perspective. The presence of both Fey and Poehler lends a singular SNL vibe to it all, although not so strong that it deters from the enjoyment of the movie. Michael McCullers's script goes for the big laughs, but also mines many opportunities for sentimentality.

The baby mama drama doesn't break new ground, but once you get over the disappointment of the picture's over-all blandness, you can sit back and soak it in. Fey and Poehler handle the dramatic elements with ease and warmth, and their contrasting personalities provide several good gags (I like what happens when Angie couldn't solve the locked toilet dilemma, and it's funny to me that the unhip Kate's entire arsenal of dance moves consists of framing her face over and over). One of Poehler's assets is this loose cannon energy she exudes and barely contains, and, here, it provides an effective synergy with Fey's more reserved core. Their culture clash scenes are fun to watch, specially when Tina puts on her appalled or bemused expression (which is often).

Poehler puts in enough work that you don't mind going thru that same old, same old. Her Angie starts out immature with horrible social manners, and her antics may make the more refined out there cringe. But she's not really meant to be an unlikable character. Gradually, Angie develops into a sympathetic woman-child.

The movie takes full advantage of Tina Fey's persona (I only wish she'd written this script). Fey has this ability to play it mousy and unassuming, yet at the same time be able to serve up her own digs. Not to mention, Fey can assume a harried mien like no one's business. No complaints about the supporting cast. Steve Martin enacts a health foods guru role and sports a ponytail wig. His character's a quirky sort, who rewards his minions with forehead-to-forehead bonding and with five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact. Sigourney Weaver runs a surrogacy center and it doesn't at all strike her character that it might tick off her clients when she blithely brags about her fertile body and constant state of pregnancy. Oh, Entitlement, thy name is Sigourney. Maura Tierney and Greg Kinnear show up but are underused. More relevant to the plot, Kinnear and Fey's romance needed more room to develop.

I might've laughed the loudest during the group therapy session, based solely on that one guy's line delivery regarding his dour Wiccan surrogate mom. I also like that the actor who plays the loser PC guy in all those PC/Mac tv commercials has a bit role. The dvd also comes with humorous audio commentary by writer/director Michael McCullers, producer Lorne Michaels, and a riffing Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

BABY MAMA, bland but enjoyable, would've been vastly improved if Tina Fey had written the script. I was expecting even more barbed skewering of stuff, more wicked jabs at obssessive upward mobility and the self-absorbed yuppie lifestyle and all things New Agey. Instead, what we get is bland.",1227830400,,5073,5.570687418936446

1400497,5,B000056PNR,"I watched this movie back in May and I want to say this is one of the funniest down to earth movies on Hollywood. It touches on a lot of today's sensitive issues surrounding surrogacy, cheating just for money, and romance.

I don't want to give the plot away but Baby Mama hits the surrogacy issue head on with Tina Fey's character looking for someone to carry her baby (her egg + donor sperm) since the doctor says she has a 1 in a million chance of conceiving. She finally finds Amy Poehler's character Angie who is willing to carry her child and then the is the hilarious sentimental music (""My Love; There is only you in my Life, the only thing that's right"") when the donor sperm/egg is inseminated into Angie. That is the part where I laughed for almost two minutes! If you think that part was funny there are a chockful of other funny parts involving the surrogacy issue and Tina and Amy's character getting along. The one that hits the spot is where the toilet is locked for safety and Angie urinates in the sink! The whole theater was cracking up at that point. If you can think of any funnier movies please contact me.

In closing this movie is a down to earth (deals with real life issues) funny movie that is worth seeing again and again! I watched it twice this year. I can guarantee you that it is worth every cent. Buy it on blu ray for the special effects.",1226793600,3,1372,4.334630350194552

1400501,5,B000056PNR,"BABY MAMA is one of the funniest comedies to come along in many months.

Written and directed by Michael McCullers, the movie stars the always hilarious SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE gal pals, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, in what is sort of a female version of THE ODD COUPLE.

Fey plays a classy, successful, well organized career woman who yearns to have a baby but, according to her doctor, cannot conceive.  With the help of surrogate broker Sigourney Weaver, she hires the free spirited Poehler to carry her baby to term, but she gets more than she bargained for when Amy and her n.g. boy friend (Dax Shepard) have a fight and the blonde from South Philly moves in with her.

These gals' lifestyles are so diverse that they make Oscar Madison and Felix Unger seem like the perfect pair.  Nevertheless, Tina is determined to make the relationship work, because that baby Amy is carrying is hers.  Or, she thinks it is.

Greg Kinnear, as the ""Prince Charming"" who enters Tina's life, and Steve Martin, as her somewhat unconventional boss, co-star in the film, along with Romany Malco, Maura Tierney and Holland Taylor.

DVD extras include an alternate ending, which we prefer over the one used in the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and some ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

1400502,4,B000056PNR,"I saw this in the theaters with some friends and we had a great time. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler clearly have a working relationship and great on screen chemistry. The film echoed some of the challenges career women have and the on screen setting in Philadelphia resonated with me, as I am in the Tri-State area.

The plot was a bit like ""You've Got Mail"", in that big business comes to kick small business' butt, but other than that it stood its ground as a funny, relevant comedy. While the acting was a bit over the top for all characters it matched the ""happy go lucky"" music and tone throughout the movie, so it was bearable.

I loved all performances by the actors, and the interlacing of current or former SNL actors was cool. The end was cute, and I was rooting for both Fey and Poehler's character which made the flick engaging for me. There were a scenes I laughed out loud, and the flick definitely has a ""rewatch"" factor. Picture and Sound both were clear on the Blu-Ray.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, due to some of the over the top acting, and because I think the film could have been ""wrapped up"" sooner. It seems it was extended unnecessarily, and I remember looking at my watch in the theater. If you love chick flicks, this one's worth a rent, to see Fey and Poehler interact on screen, and it's a good time, with a couple of girlfriends.",1224979200,3,1359,4.34251968503937
1400503,4,B000056PNR,"I suppose every woman who wants kids also wants to be the perfect mother. When you're becoming a mother using someone else's uterus, though there are complications in reaching perfection.

After the plot gets underway with Sigourney Weaver as matchmaker of a very special sort (and scary), Kate and Angie enter a business relationship. Kate can't become pregnant, and Angie's uterus didn't have any plans for the next nine months: Angie will carry Kate's child to term, for a fee. After falling out with her boyfriend (just what entitles him to any part of her fee, again?), low-rent Angie moves into high-rent Kate's apartment, creating an Oscar and Felix odd couple. Kate isn't just a Type A personality, she's A+ and going for extra credit. Angie's a slacker party girl, so the plot centers on turning the two of them into one perfect mother. And, after a dramatic blowout toward the end, everyone ends up predictably happy.

Throw in an assortment of other amusing characters: a doorman of surprising wisdom, ditzy birth coach, boyfriend worth losing, boyfriend worth acquiring, and cheerfully deranged boss, and this turns into a solid (if forgettable) comedy. There's nothing offensive here, or not much, but it's not for young viewers uncertain about the baby-making process.

Still, I wasn't expecting much because the commercials seemed more crude than funny. I found that it was better than I thought it would be, however not really by much.

I was disappointed in the humor of this movie. I did expect more laughs than I got, especially considering the comedic ability of Tina and Amy. There really weren't many laughs. On the other hand, there was more real drama than we expected, but only enough to kind of hold our attention. I did enjoy Greg Kinnear and the fantastic Steve Martin, though there roles were relatively small.

It is a cute story and its a comedy that actually has some substance. This is one of the better SNL cast-goes-to-make-a-movie films as opposed to the ones that try so hard to be funny that it makes the movie awful. I was pleasantly surprised to really like this movie.

1400507,4,B000056PNR,"The TV ads for this movie gave me low expectations and I enjoyed it much more than I expected. I thought it would be one long series of gags about the uptight career woman and the white trash surrogate.  There were plenty of such moments but the movie had a lot more to offer.

The cast was put together well.  I knew Tina Fey (Kate) and Amy Poehler (Angie) work well together from watching SNL.  But they can do the more subtle scenes as well as over-the-top comedy sketches.  And the supporting cast had some great characters:  Steve Martin as Kate's boss, the New Age-y head of a Whole Foods-type grocery chain, and Sigourney Weaver, as the inexplicably fertile and smug head of the surrogacy center, play their parts perfectly. The ending was fairly prediactable but that didn't take away from my enjoyment.

The DVD has both wide-screen and full-screen formats on a 2-sided disk.  The bonus features include an alternate ending (not as good as the one they chose), deleted scenes, and a couple sections on how the movie came together, as well as the usual commentary.  Given the comedy improv background of so many of the actors, a bloopers or outtakes section would have made a good additional bonus feature.

If you were put off by the TV ads for this movie, give it a chance.  It's better than one would expect from the ads.",1224288000,2,1332,4.578059071729958

1400509,3,B000056PNR,"I wish I would have liked this movie a little more.

Pluses -- I found several scenes to be laugh out loud funny and as a collector of humor and great one-liners I would consider purchasing the film for those film moments alone. Both actresses shine with physical comedy and in the art of sarcastic one-liners. I was surprised by a plot twist. Steve Martin played freak with great flair and over-the-top weirdness. He may have been the best part of the movie.

Minuses -- verbal flinging of male body parts got old, however, and the stereotypes grew a little thin. The movie grew much more serious about halfway in and the humor slowed. I didn't fully buy into the romance between Kinnear and Fey.

I recommend the movie to those who aren't looking for great depth, nor for a laugh a second. It's a cute girls night movie. The language is moderate to tame, writing clever, acting fun and the sex is closeted. If you don't expect much you probably won't be disappointed. Expect reproduction/birthing comments and a few embarrassing moments. I'd suggest giving it a red box rental if you are considering purchasing it, that way you're only out a buck if you hate it.",1223596800,2,1164,4.613526570048309

Maybe I expected too much before sitting down to the film,(with images in my head of Fey's Mean Girls or Poehler's performance in Blades of Glory) but if what you expect is an Apatow-esque comic romp, Baby Mama isn't quite your film.

Kate(Tina Fey) is a hard working, career-driven women with little time for much else in her life, only she can't stop thinking about one thing that is missing, a baby. One big problem, she's single and 37.

Of course Kate turns to surrogacy where she encounters Angie(Amy Poehler) a loosey-goosey opposite of Kate herself.

When Angie gets in a fight with her foul-tounged boyfriend Carl(Dax Shepard) Kate takes her in, and the 'bonding' commences.

It's not a laugh-every-minute, but it's a cute film worth one watch.

What I know about her is that she'll have a secure career the next 4+ years if my favorite VP candidate - Sarah Palin - makes into office (unlikely as it is). My wife and I are approaching our late 30s and some of the elements of this film hit close to home for us as we are considering starting a family now and my wife has had some of the same symptoms as Fey's lead character. So these were some of the more interesting elements.

It had some problem points as the whole potential ""Baby M"" type issue of the surrogate wanting to keep the child was copped out by the in-vitro failing ... just as the surrogate was impregnated by her trashy boyfriend? Also, Fey's character was an ""organic foods corp VP"" ?? - earning 6 figures (not anything like a real person).

They also had some deus ex machina elements like Fey's character eventually being impregnated by Greg Kinnear's although she was nearly-infertile. and then her side-stepping years and $$$ of red tape to adopt ... a black toddler. My understanding being that U.S. adoption agencies are loathe to allow inter-racial adoptions.

It has great characters,including Steve Martin, and a well written screenplay with clever and hilarious jokes around every corner. Trust me, your girl will want to rent it, but you will be the one who agrees with me at the end. Lorne Michaels produced it, it's funny. *Also rent Forgetting Sarah Marshall",1222041600,2,644,4.322314049586777
1400520,4,B000056PNR,"Normally I run as far as possible from any film described as both ""female"" and ""comedic"". To quote the late great John Belushi, ""Chicks aren't funny"". And 9 outta 10 times I gotta agree with him. But there is just something about Tina Fey. Is it that she's hot while humorous? No, that's not it. Or maybe because unlike every other female comedian, she doesn't tell jokes about how bad her boyfriend is or how it sucks to have a period? Nope, she at times goes there too. So what is it about her?

To put it simply, it's her timing. Along with the ability to write her own material without a man to spell it out for her, she has one of the most endearing ways to speak-out those typical lines, making anything she says to be ironicly funny no matter what the content. It's no wonder her NBC sitcom 30 Rock has been showered in Emmy's, including the words of it's male lead, completely written from her female mind. This is one lady twenty years from now could be placed next to Lucille Ball and Roseanne Barr as one of the Comedy Queens of all time.

So now we have her first starring role in Baby Mama. It's what you'd expect from her, much like her 30 Rock character, of a late 30-something trying to make it in a crazy-filled world. But instead of a television show scenerio, this time she's trying to have a child while realizing that in order to do so because of her dreaded T-shaped uterus, a surrogate mother will be needed. Now don't get me wrong, her character is exactly like Liz Lemon going as far as wondering just when Alec Baldwin was going to pop his head in. But again, it's her lines and delivery that make this typical lighthearted comedy worth watching. Fellow SNL cast member Amy Poehler plays a decent underprivileged not-so-bright bun-carrier, though at times she seems a little too old to play the part, but does very well in bouncing off Tina's reactions. In fact, the film also has a great and capable supporting cast featuring Sigourney Weaver, Steve Martin, Dax Shepard, and in one of his most likable parts in quite awhile, Greg Kinnear. And even when you think you figured out how the whole movie's gonna be ten minutes in, it throws you a curveball that you didn't think the movie had in it. This is the type of film that both parts of a couple can enjoy without the male involved looking for a reason to leave the room. Funny, but smart. Goofy, but fresh. Laughs without the eye rolling. And also all things said that relate to Tina Fey as well.

The DVD presentation is typical: a two-sided, single layer each disc with a few extras on each side with decent picture/bit rate/audio. Not that this film will make you think you've found one of the best female buddy pictures of all time, but it won't make you want to turn on Nascar immediately to redeem yourself either. Tina Fey might be one of the best things to happen to female comedy in a long, long time. Let's hope that unlike alot of her gender peers, she only gets even better with age.

1400521,3,B000056PNR,"Kate Holbrook (Fey) has devoted her life to her career, gaining promotion after promotion to become an executive in an organic foods company.  Now 37 and single, she's determined to have a child, but her doctor finds that her chances of becoming pregnant are remote.  So she decides to investigate surrogacy, and hires South Philadelphia working girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) for the job.
 When Angie becomes pregnant, Kate shifts into obsessive mother-to-be gear, showering Angie with baby care books, pregnancy videos, and prenatal health care manuals.  To complicate matters, Angie leaves her common-law husband, Carl (Dax Shepard), has nowhere to go, and winds up moving in with Kate.  Angie feels smothered by Kate's overprotectiveness and would rather play video games than watch dull documentaries and take horse-pill sized vitamins.
 Written and directed by Michael McCullers, ""Baby Mama"" is a pleasant, though predictable, comedy that relies on the charm and comic timing of its two leading ladies.  Fey and Poehler are both alumni of ""Saturday Night Live"" and Fey is the star and writer of one of TV's brightest comedies, ""30 Rock.""  They work well together in ""Baby Mama"" and the growing relationship of Kate and Angie is what keeps us involved.
 ""Baby Mama"" features Fey in the kind of role that fits her well.  She's effective at playing smart and clever because she is.  We would have trouble, I think, accepting her in a purely harebrained role.  In her previous film, ""Mean Girls,"" she played a levelheaded, tough, funny teacher who dispenses sensible advice to her students about name calling and self-image.  In ""Baby Mama,"" we feel her character's strong desire to have a child and we empathize with her.  At the same time, her Kate is always upbeat, taking the bumps in the road as they come, dealing with them, and never collapsing into helpless hysteria.  Poehler is a first-rate comedienne.  Watching her, I was reminded of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett's ability to handle slapstick and slip into a character with accompanying facial expressions and mannerisms to land gags.  Poehler is very broad as Angie, in comic contrast with Fey's tightly wound portrayal. The supporting cast is impressive.  Sigourney Weaver plays Chaffee Bicknell, the steely businesswoman who heads the private clinic that matches up Kate and Angie.  Steve Martin is Barry, Kate's New Age boss, who is very funny as a touchy-feely CEO.  Greg Kinnear is Rob, a nice guy who runs a juice bar in the neighborhood in which Kate's company will open a new retail store.  Romany Malco plays Oscar, the wisecracking, street-smart doorman who is on hand for the apt one-liner or wide-eyed reaction shot.  Holland Taylor plays Kate's Mom as a woman who's never heard of political correctness, speaking her mind as those around her cringe.  Maura Tierney is Caroline, Kate's sister, who's usually shown with her kids in tow mostly as contrast to Kate's motherlessness, but otherwise has little to do.
 Siobhan Fallon is a birthing teacher with a severe lisp.  We see her in a few scenes but the speech impediment is never referred to, making it all the more amusing.  Shepard is very good as Carl, a role that could have been mere redneck, dumb hillbilly, but comes off wittier and more original because of Shepard's doofy likability.  If you look hard enough, you'll also spot ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members Fred Armisen and Will Forte.
 Though ""Baby Mama,"" rated PG-13 for sexual humor and language, is fun, I kept feeling the leads deserved better, sharper-edged material.  There certainly are laughs, but they're not machine-gunned as in an ""Airplane!"" or ""Naked Gun"" film.  The film is one of many to come from producer Lorne Michaels, father of ""Saturday Night Live,"" who has had an uneven box office record moving his ""SNL"" cast members onto the big screen.

She's been promoted to Vice President of Development of Round Earth Food Stores, an organic health food grocery chain. Barry (Steve Martin) her boss, is a New Age hippie entrepreneur who makes every decision by meditative vibes.

Her salary makes most things affordable, so when she has a yen to have a baby, she goes looking at every angle:  a sperm bank, a boyfriend, etc. until she hears the bad news that's she's almost 100% infertile.

Her solution is to do what most people in her shoes couldn't afford:  She'll pay for a surrogate mother to carry one of her eggs, have it inseminated, and bring it to birth.  The agency, Chaffee Bicknell, is headed by the ever-so-smooth Sigourney Weaver, who into her forties is a specimen of fertility herself.

Her perspective client is Angie (Amy Poehler), someone whose working class toughness excels--even if her intuitive sense is closer to Barry's and keener than her street smarts.  Her husband, Carl (Dax Shepard) is an inconsiderate and unfaithful slob.  An inventor by trade, his idea of supplementing income is hounding the phone, so he can be the #107 caller for the next rock trivia question.

Eventually, complications will have Angie leaving Carl during her pregnancy and moving in with Kate with no where else to go.  There are predictable clashes as Kate, a control freak, will have much to say about her prospective child's diet and the surrogate mother's lifestyle.  Kate's profession will make her dote on Angie eating organic pea soup; while Angie craves junk food.  Obsessive-compulsive Kate will insist on subliminal foreign language tapes to rear the embryo on the fast track to success; while Angie roars out her favorite Karaoke songs and sing-a-long games.  As you might expect the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding/Diane Chambers-Karla Torelli match up will make some funny and some predictable situations.

On the periphery of Kate's life are romantic opportunities with Junga Juice bar competitor, Rob Ackerman(Greg Kinnear) who offers some quality time as well as some pointed observations about what chain stores can do to small business owners.

I enjoyed the culture clash provided by Fey and Poehler, but felt the badly needed romance was a welcome respite from the strife found in the central conflict.  Martin's small role is refreshingly different from the protective father/hyperactive jerk he's played in the past--even if his character seems a little creepy here.  Sigourney Weaver is smooth and seasoned as the savvy, but sweet agency head who knows how to talk to adults like kindergarteners and get away with it.

Not all the humor is funny or subtle.  ""I'd rather be shot in the face than eat this stupid food!"" shouts Angie when pressured to do things Kate's way.  Significantly, this is a 'Saturday Night Live' movie.  (Fey, Poehler, Martin are in it, and Lorne Michaels is also the producer here.)  While not always entertaining, the situations and characters are unique and fun enough to see at least once.

I write with great disappointment that Baby Mama, written and directed by Michael McCullers (The spy who shagged me) does nothing to take advantage of this dynamo duo.

The script co-opted mainstream Hollywoods's version of humor and dulled down most opportunites for belly shaking laughter. Amy Peohler's character loses her quirky charm early on in the film, and Tina Fey's character begins to take herself way too seriously.

Perhaps the film wanted to send messages: what is friendship, what is loyalty, and forgot that it was supposed to be a comedy.

It's not that the movie wasn't cute (it is) or sweet (it is), but it just does not hit the mark.",1221264000,6,817,4.780141843971631
1400527,3,B000056PNR,"Another reviewer notes this is a very average comedy and I whole-heartedly agree with that sentiment.  Yet again, I find that Lorne Michaels and the SNL crew just can't seem to deliver good, solid, entertainment.  (If you've seen my scathing review of Hot Rod, which apparently offended more than a few readers, you'd know I'm not terribly impressed with the creative team at SNL...)

Let me say that this isn't a bad film, certainly no where near as bad as the pretty weak Hot Rod, but it was no where near as funny as it could have been, or as other films with similar stories have been in the past.  For example, my wife loves the movie Paternity, and as something similar, I'd definitely rate it much more solidly above Baby Mama.

The concept is solid enough, and Amy Poehler gets in some funny lines and brazen behavior that is amusing, but the results in the final product seem, well, quite average.  The story is predictable and even with distractions like Steve Martin's performance where he seems to be channeling some of the J. Peterman character from Seinfeld, the laughs just don't come as freely as they should.

I put this one into the 'rent it' category for sure.  Go in with low expectations and you shouldn't be disappointed, but if you expect too much, you'll probably be left unfulfilled.",1221177600,6,1308,4.656521739130435
1400528,2,B000056PNR,"It's already been said that the script was weak for this film.  I concur.  I believe Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, if not the best female comedians ever produced by SNL, they are most certainly among the top 4 or 5.  That's why it's such a shame they didn't have a great script to help make this a great comedy.  Sometimes mediocre acting can be elevated by a good script, but seldom can a poor script be saved by the actors, however good they may be.

Tina Fey should never agree to take on another comedic role without serious control of the script - she's too good a writer to risk her career to a bummer like this one.  And she and Poehler have such wonderful chemistry & splendid timing together, it's just a shame this movie wasn't what it might have been.",1221177600,12,758,4.265734265734266

Greg Kinnear is comfortable in this role and steal one of the scenes.  Tina, who I find especially talented, makes the movie an emotional ride.  I connected with her character and felt her sorrow, however, she is quite the comedian as well.  Amy Poehler brings on the laughs and is quite rude, crude, and sensationally hilarious.  I was impressed with her performance, she is a complex character.  The twists were fresh and I was actually fooled.  Steve Martin delivers an awkward performance and pulls it off.  Dax Shepard's performance suits him well and thankfully he is in a very small role in the movie.  This movie delivers great laughs, good twists, an all-star cast, a heartfelt movie.  If you have seen these comedians on SNL you know they have good chemistry and play off each other.  Rent it, buy it, put in your collection, do all three.  This is a solid four out of five.  Why is it only four stars and not five?  Well, I think the scenes with the irritating women giving the class with her Elmer Fudd impersonation was a bad idea.

She hires Angie Ostrowski to become a surrogate mother. Angie is sometimes childish and gets on Kate's nerves. Angie starts to feel guilty because she's not really pregnant.

Behold, the surrogate mother of your worst nightmares.  Angie isn't exactly mother material.  In fact she acts more like a toddler than most kids do.  She also doesn't like to be bossed around by Kate, even if it's for the better.  Thus, baby mama drama.

Fey and Poehler both turn in surprisingly impressive performances.  They were both funny, played their characters well and illustrated great onscreen chemistry.  Watch out for an oddball, yet humorous performance from Steve Martin who plays Kate's hippie/environmentalist boss.

1400533,3,B000056PNR,"Whether it's her surprisingly refreshing take on a novel about modern day teenagers (Mean Girls) or snarky one-liners about today's news (SNL's Weekend Update), Tina Fey has become known for delivering on-screen the dialogue she previously wrote behind the scenes.  Paired up with her Update partner in crime, Amy Poehler, and the two should be unstoppable because as quippy with just a touch of absurdity, Fey's writing somehow always manages to be both relevant and laugh out-loud funny.  Unfortunately her turn as a perpetually single career woman desperate for a child of her own in Michael McCullers' Baby Mama is neither of those things.  Perhaps Fey just wanted to prove she could relinquish some control with Baby Mama, or perhaps her real life baby kept her from wearing too many hats on this project, but in either case, the lackluster result cries out for her attention like any newborn.

Fans of Fey and Poehler from their SNL days, or even more recent projects like 30 Rock and Hamlet 2 respectively, will want to give Baby Mama a shot just to see their girls back on-screen as a duo.  But fans who expect anything more than a warm smile or a meek chuckle will be sorely disappointed.  Baby Mama is a female buddy comedy written by a man and within the studio system, which may explain why Fey and Poehler's natural chemistry gets buried by stereotypical Felix and Oscar gags.  When Fey's Kate learns she has a one in a million chance of getting pregnant, she looks for a surrogate, and despite her anal retentively immaculate apartment and Ivy league-esque persona, she still hires the free-spirited, messy, tells-it-like-it-is Angie (Poehler).  The two embark on a friendship of opposites that would never have taken place but for the check that was being passed between the two, and sadly that fact never lingers too far from the audience's minds, making the union feel that much more forced.  Had the two women found they actually had more in common once they got to know each other, the story wouldn't have been saved, but it would have been better.  Instead, though, McCullers forces lessons down the audience's throats: how the women learn from each other--one to calm down and one to grow up--and in the process, they learn how to be mothers.  Too sappy to truly be real, and if there's any question about that, just wait for the end when once again the Hollywood ending breaks through any cynicism to prove the impossible can happen... in the movies.

Oddly, McCullers' men aren't any more believable than his women in Baby Mama.  Each one (from Greg Kinnear to Dax Shepard, and even Steve Martin) is hapless in his own way, and while goofiness can be cute in doses, these are men who are as immature as children.  Instead of building up the characters, McCullers seems to rely on the timeliness of his film, incorporating countless pop culture references (Jamba Juice; American Idol karaoke) that are so oversaturated, they feel more like product placement than just typical elements of everyday life.  It appears Baby Mama tries to pick up where Mean Girls left off: a witty, slice of life, character connection film, but like the aging party girl that Kate appears when Angie drags her out to a club, it just appears tired, overcompensating, and out of place among the actually hip crowd.

The bonus features on the DVD release include an audio commentary with McCullers, his two stars, and Executive Producer Lorne Michaels, who can't get a word in edgewise between Fey and Poehler's wisecracks (they sounds oddly pent-up, as if they wanted to release all that funny on-set but were restrained) and the director's incessant need to pipe in with technical knowledge (as if to prove he really does know what he's doing).  There are also the obligatory deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and a making-of featurette (""From Conception to Delivery"") that once again proves the stars' knack for comedy was wasted in the feature.",1220400000,8,3949,4.8614008941877795

1400542,3,B000056PNR,"Baby Mama is a cute film with a few good laughs and some essentially entertaining comedy. It's by no means going to be ""movie of the year;"" but it isn't a flop, either. Baby Mama gets its strength from some excellent acting and the plot moves along at a good pace. My basic regret is that it could have been so much funnier than it was. It is an ambitious film, too, in that it tackles a serious issue through comedy. Sadly, it doesn't completely accomplish either goal. Sigh.

When the action begins, career woman Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) realizes that her biological clock is ticking fast and she doesn't have the one thing to make her feel truly happy and complete--a baby. Everywhere Kate goes, she sees babies and she adores them. Eventually, Kate finds out that she can't have a baby even through artificial means; and then she goes to a fancy agency run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver) to find a surrogate mother.

Naturally, Chaffee Bicknell reassures Kate that the $100,000 fee for getting a top ""quality"" woman to carry her baby for nine months is well worth it--and then Chaffee steers Kate right toward a somewhat sleazy woman named Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler) who is posing as a model woman to carry another woman's baby. Angie's common-law husband/boyfriend Carl (Dax Shepard) isn't any more sophisticated or much better than Angie.

Time goes by and Kate and Angie live together when Angie has a break up with Carl. This provides mild comic relief with the predictable conflicts two people face when one (Kate) is a highly educated, straight laced and uptight career woman while the other (Angie) lives for singing along with her ""American Idol"" video game while munching constantly on potato chips, eating all types of junk food and even drinking! And yes, there's a bit more comic relief one night when Angie and Kate go out dancing--but it's just not as funny as it could have been. Sigh.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Kate's baby arrangement work out? Will Angie and Carl ever divulge their huge secret to Kate? What about Angie's pregnancy--how does Kate help out with that? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

Look for a great performance by Tina Fey as Kate; and Greg Kinnear gives a terrific performance as Rob, a guy Kate becomes romantically involved with. Steve Martin also fits in well as Barry, Kate's boss at the health-food company.

Overall, Baby Mama gets a pat on the back from me for some good aspects--I liked the acting and the plot moves along well. However, as a comedy it falls short of my expectations although the subplots involving Carl and Angie's ""secret"" and Kate's romance with Rob are fairly well done. Take in this movie on a rainy afternoon if you've already seen some better films first. Baby Mama is one flick you should see--but only if you get a completely free opening in your schedule.

1400543,4,B000056PNR,"BABY MAMA is NOT just a ""chick-flick.""  In somewhat the same way that KNOCKED UP had broad-based appeal...BABY MAMA works on a similar level.  It does NOT have the raunch factor of KNOCKED UP...but it is still very funny and for the most part avoids the maudlin pitfalls that cause some ""romantic comedies"" to turn off guys.

As a guy myself, I came to the movie primarily looking forward to the performance of Tina Fey.  She's got such an oddball screen persona...we know she's razor sharp and quick-witted...but she's also awkward and unsure of herself.  Her character in BABY MAMA does not stray from her comfort zone.  She plays a very successful executive with a national chain of ""organic"" grocery stores.  But she's feeling the pull of biology...her clock is ticking.  And her doctor ""doesn't like [her] uterus.""  So after a little hemming and hawing, she decides to use a surrogate mother to carry her biological child.  That mother is played by Amy Poehler as a very backward, uneducated ""hick,"" who, after breaking up with her common law husband, moves in with Fey.

In many ways, this movie is more of an ODD COUPLE than a movie about babies and parenting. While there are many obligatory scenes, such as the visits to the Lamaze classes...they are played for comedy...not to comment on birthing or childrearing.  Just the crazy relationship between these two comedy talents is much of the fun.

More fun is provided by Steve Martin as Fey's boss.  He's the CEO of ""Round Earth"" foods, and he flat out steals every scene he's in.  Martin is used sparingly, which only makes his presence all the more welcome.  With his long-hair and ridiculous philosophical insights...Martin is a delight.  The part is well-written and Martin revels in it.  Sigourney Weaver makes a very funny impact in her few scenes as the head of the surrogate parent organization.  She's a ridiculously fertile woman, readily carrying twins to term at her age...which drives Fey simply insane.

Into Fey's life comes an inevitable romantic complication, in the form of Greg Kinnear.  Their relationship has a decent amount of zest...but frankly, it's just not as interesting as other parts of the film.  The two performers are charming together...but you never quite shake the feeling that this all a plot device, or at least a way to make Fey's ""single-motherhood"" more palatable.  And Maura Tierney, who REALLY deserves a good comedic role, is a welcome but wasted presence as Fey's sister.  She's given almost nothing to do.

Dax Shepherd plays Poehler's ""husband,"" and here's now an actor who has reached my radar.  I've noticed him in other roles, but this was the first time I took any note of him.  I think he shows comedic promise.  He also looks a lot like Zach Braff, for what it's worth.

There's nothing earth-shattering in BABY MAMA.  It doesn't elicit the gasps or guffaws of KNOCKED UP...but it does consistently cause laughter and it leaves a quite satisfying smile on your face when it's all said and done.  Tina Fey has written another zinger filled, intelligent and pleasing film.",1209600000,3,3082,4.869230769230769
1400544,4,B000056PNR,"Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are a match made in heaven.  While SNL was going through an unbearably long comedic drought with the likes of Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz unjustifiably stealing the limelight, it was Fey and Poehler's ""fake"" news that made the show tolerable.  Now, with a solid and very funny show (NBC's 30 Rock) under her belt and having already written for movies before (Mean Girls) it seems only natural that Fey steps out into a leading role that can showcase her sharp, intelligent humor. And teamed with Poehler's wild and energetic goofball slapstick, the two are undeniably funny and share great chemistry.

  The story is about Kate Holbrook, an upwardly mobile business executive for a health food store based in Philadelphia (and run by a pompous new-agey hippie type, played by comedian Steve Martin).  After years of successfully nuturing her career, Kate suddenly realizes one day that she would love to nuture something else...a baby.  With repeated failed attempts at pregnancy and her doctor's assessment that she is incapable of becoming pregnant, Kate decides to go the route of surrogacy via an agency run by the extremely fertile, Chaffee Bicknell (the wickedly funny Sigourney Weaver in a small but hilarious role!).

  Enter Angie Ostrowiski, a less-than-desirable prospect who decides that she will carry a baby for Kate for a large chunk of money.  The story then focuses on the two women's relationship as the pregnancy progresses and the very different lifestyles they lead.  This is when the two comediennes can really play off each other.  I do agree with one reviewer, however, that states that the movie was a little overly ""mushy"" in parts. I would have liked to seen a little more of Fey's cynical/dry humor but overall the film is enjoyable with a good cast.  Also, the movie is peppered with funny cast members of SNL, past and present!

  This is a respectable first outing for two of SNL's funniest ladies.

That puts most of the pressure on the two women to make this farce work as a distaff version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odd-Couple/dp/B0000507P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odd Couple</a>&nbsp;with a pregnancy angle, and they often - you should pardon the expression - deliver.

Ideally cast with her smart, bespectacled looks, Fey plays 37-year-old Kate Holbrook, single and professionally successful as the VP of an upscale organic supermarket chain much like Whole Foods. She hears her biological clock ticking and is taking every step possible to have a baby. Her last straw is to pay an agency $100,000 to find a surrogate. Naturally, her polar opposite shows up as the ideal candidate - a junk-food-eating, Red Bull-swilling piece of white trash named Angie Ostrowski who comes with her money-grubbing boyfriend Carl. Kate is so desperate she is practically begging Angie to carry her egg, so Angie willingly accepts. Somehow, the women end up living together during the pregnancy and inevitably get on each other's nerves, more Angie on Kate's nerves since a few revelations threaten to upend the deal. Convenience appears to trump logic in tying up the plot's loose ends, of which there are many. However, McCullers' alternately sauntering and piercing Judd Apatow-like approach helps compensate for the bigger lapses.

A game cast also helps. Although fairly limited as an actress, Fey is sharp and likable as the often dour Kate and has the ability to bring the implausibility of her character's situation into more human focus. Even though she is entirely too old for her role, Poehler is a more natural comic presence as Angie, terrifically manic but surprisingly poignant during key moments. It's obvious their joint casting has more to do with their proven rapport than dramatic credibility. In a turn worthy of Jeff Foxworthy, Dax Shepard credibly makes Carl a mercenary sheep. Romany Malco (memorable as Andy's horned-up co-worker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>) is given little to do as the streetwise doorman, the same fate of Maura Tierney bland as Kate's supportive sister. Greg Kinnear must be getting awfully tired playing the same type of romantic foil over and over again, but he does do it well even though his scenes also seem strangely truncated. Two veterans threaten to steal the picture in acts of petty larceny - a pony-tailed Steve Martin very funny as Kate's Zen-seeking boss whose idea of a reward is allowing her to stare at him for five minutes, and Sigourney Weaver as the overtly self-satisfied and all-too-fertile head of the agency. SNL regulars Will Forte and Fred Armisen show up in cameos, as does Thomas McCarthy as Kate's first dinner date (he just made a wondrous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B0015OKWKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>).

1400546,2,B000056PNR,"Tina Fey is very near a comic genius: check her out on ""Saturday Night Live"" and the hilarious ""30 Rock"" (which she also writes for and conceived) and her acting and more importantly writing on arguably the best teen movie ever, ""Mean Girls.""
It's a shame that Fey did not write the script for ""Baby Mama"" for it is at this very basic level that this film fails: weak script=weak film.
With that said the mere presence of Fey (as Kate Holbrook, barren and wanting a child) and Amy Poehler (as Angie Ostrowski who is hired by Angie to carry her child) ups the ante of said weak script but to be honest very few scenes pop with Life: instead most fall flat. ""BM"" simply needs a shot of adrenaline as the energy level is just above inert.
In a film without many highlights, Romany Malco (""40 Year Old Virgin"") as Kate's street-wise Doorman and Steve Martin as Kate's boss: pony-tailed and dripping with self-satisfaction (Martin's character operates as a device to poke big fun at the Whole Foods phenom) offer something that this film desperately needs as a whole: quirkiness and irony.
""Baby Boom"" with Diane Keaton from 20+ years ago comes to mind as a well written, impeccably performed film about a career woman coping with a child: it is funny, winsome, performed with a thoughtfulness that lingers in the mind. Nothing about ""Baby Mama"" will linger except the stench of a talented group of actors mired in the mud of a poorly conceived quagmire of a film.",1209168000,8,1459,4.615384615384615
1400547,3,B000056PNR,"Baby Mama is a jokey, shallow movie that you forget by the time you get to the parking lot. There's nothing really wrong with it, but it doesn't grab you like it should. It could be so much better.

The film has a lot to work with, including its stars. Amy Poehler plays Angie, the ""Baby Mama"" of the title, with lots of broad, tacky, physical humor. She has great comic timing. Tina Fey plays Kate, whose uncooperative uterus makes her hire Angie as a surrogate mother. Fey glows in this movie. She's a rare actor the audience is always pulling for, wanting her to do well and be happy. The supporting cast includes Steve Martin and Sigourney Weaver, both chewing up the scenery with gusto whenever onscreen. Greg Kinnear plays Tina Fey's love interest with his usual offhand charm.

With so much quality material to work with, the movie should be better. The problem is that the film aims too low, and is happy to be nothing more than a simple, innocuous comedy. You're never really meant to believe in the characters or the story, so the writers go for the joke instead of the truth. For example, when Kate and Angie go out clubbing, you're not supposed to notice that Kate would never dress like a cheap hooker or overlook Angie drinking alcohol. Seeing the classy Fey in a leather getup is jarring.

There were some nice touches. I liked hearing ""Stay Up Late"" by the Talking Heads. Kate's gynecologist holds a coffee mug in the shape of a pregnant woman's torso as he tells her he ""doesn't like"" her uterus. Kate orders an Orange You Glad I Didn't Say Banana smoothie.

The ending reminded me of the conclusion of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smart-People/dp/B0015HOKI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smart People</a>: babies equal happiness. Sounds good, if you don't think too hard.",1209168000,,1832,4.957654723127036
1400548,3,B000056PNR,"The biggest problem with ""Baby Mama"" is that it's a meaningful story trapped in a goofball comedy. You watch feeling confident about the idea while at the same time disapproving of the unnecessary jokiness; most of the characters in this film are nothing more than broadly drawn caricatures, people so silly and one-dimensional that they do a great disservice to the compelling plot. I'm not saying that it needed to be a melodramatic Lifetime Original Movie; what I am saying is that the sense of humor was too distracting for anything of value to sink in. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler--both capable actors--gave their all for this film, which is still disappointing because I know they could have given much more, especially if the story had been allowed to be more serious. Too many jokes coupled with not enough sincerity made for a film that tried too hard to be something it never should have been.

The plot: Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a successful single businesswoman who let her career get in the way of marriage and family. While happy as the vice president of a health food supermarket chain in Philadelphia, she finally admits to herself that, at age thirty-seven, she wants to have a baby. Adoption turns out to be a big dead end, since single people have to wait at least five years before they're even considered by an agency. Artificial insemination doesn't work, either; her doctor attributes the pregnancy's failure to her T-shaped uterus, which he repeatedly says he doesn't like. According to him, her chances of conceiving naturally are one in a million. The only remaining option is to hire a surrogate mother. Kate is initially hesitant, since she thinks only weird people resort to that.

But she soon comes around. She visits a clinic run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver), a woman whose soft-spoken determination is so overplayed that it's actually a little creepy. She carries around her own infant baby, seemingly to flaunt the fact that she was able to conceive at such an advanced maternal age. Apparently, her uterus is in top notch condition, almost as if it were younger than the rest of her body. Whatever. She tells Kate that a surrogate a mother is like a nanny, but in this case, the baby is taken care of before it's born. That seems to win Kate over, even after the fee is set at $100,000. ""It costs more to have someone born than to have someone killed,"" Kate remarks. ""It takes longer,"" is Chaffee's nonchalant reply, and yes, that is funny.

What isn't so funny are the many characters--main and side alike--that now enter Kate's life. The most important main character is Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler), who agrees to be Kate's surrogate mother. The conflict of the plot becomes apparent: Angie is an immature slob that eats the wrong foods, drinks the wrong drinks, and doesn't know how to amuse herself quietly. She would prefer to sing karaoke or to watch ""America's Funniest Home Videos."" Her common-law boyfriend, Carl (Dax Shepard), isn't much better. Actually, he's a lot worse. You'll know this is true when the first of three plot twists is revealed.

Almost every other side character is a desperate comic stereotype. Some are merely annoying while others are barely tolerable. Take, for example, the uncredited Steve Martin as Barry, the president of the health food chain--he's one of those holistic types that senses good vibes and sits cross-legged on top of a desk during important meetings. He praises good work by touching foreheads. He demands that the newest store be built with the essence of a seashell he found running barefoot through an airport. At one point, he whispers to Angie that the secret to his success is to have a large penis; that could have been symbolic under different circumstances, but here, it just seems like an excuse to deliver yet another one-liner.

Another example is birthing teacher (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) that promotes healthy communication, denounces anyone considering an epidural during childbirth, and shows how to massage the birth canal with olive oil to prevent tearing. She has one or two amusing lines, but one wonders why she had to talk like Elmer Fudd; the closest this film gets to being a cartoon is an argument over whether or not Tom and Jerry were friends. That, and when Angie pees in the bathroom sink because she can't lift the toilet's childproofed lid.

There is one subplot that worked well, despite being underdeveloped. Kate begins dating Rob (Greg Kinnear), a former lawyer who now runs a failing smoothie shop (and as he keeps reminding everyone, his shop is nothing like Jamba Juice). The humor of their relationship is subtler and much more convincing, probably because the focus shifts from the turmoil of pregnancy to the anxieties of romance. I also appreciated a few select moments between Kate and Angie, especially as their friendship grows deeper. At that point, Angie begins to realize that she needs to grow up and be completely honest. Unfortunately, I can't elaborate on that because a major plot point would be given away--let's just say that Angie hasn't told Kate everything about herself. Let's also say that there's far too little of this compelling material to do the film any good; ""Baby Mama"" just wants to joke around and be goofy, even when the material calls for seriousness. A single woman hiring a surrogate mother is a story open to all sorts of wonderful possibilities. It's a shame that almost none of them were explored in this film.",1209081600,6,5478,4.872317596566524
