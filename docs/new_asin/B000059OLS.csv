1407500,5,B000059OLS,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD version, fascinated with the idea of Shatner before Trek, and the whole Esperanto idea. I am NOT disappointed! Before writing this, I read the first 7 reviews so I'll try not to repeat stuff (I agreed with most of what was said). I first heard of Esperanto back in college at U of Wisc--Madison, where it was offered in night classes. Apparently, it's been around since the 1880's, developed as a ""universal language"". There have been resurgences of interest periodically since, most notably during the 60's. The director chose Esperanto because he wanted an ""other-worldly"" language for the demons that couldn't be compared to any other. It works, phenomenally well!! Shatner is quite good, as is Allyson Ames (Kia) and Ann Atmar (as Shatner's sister). Unfortunately, the acting of Eloise Hardt (as Kia's sister) and Milos Milos (title character) is reminisent of Ed Wood's films, WAY over the top of respectable limits. The music score by Dominic Frontiere is eerie, moody and thoroughly appropriate and the photography of the great Conrad Hall is among the best black and white you'll ever see...his use of shadows and fog and back-lighting gives the film ALL of its considerable atmosphere. The location of the Big Sur area in California is perfect. I would recommend this film for anyone with an appreciation of the unusual. Sure, there are a lot of slow moments that were annoying (but just look at the scenery); the overall craft of film-making here has indeed reached a new (if different) level. By all means, check this one out!",990403200,22,1579,4.917602996254682
1407501,5,B000059OLS,"What a quirky, trippy, great DVD!  The photography is amazing and the company putting this out went to a lot of trouble to rescue the film from it's MIA action status for the last 30-something years.  Well worth it!  I am not a huge Shatner fan but I enjoyed his commentary -- it's very sardonic which works well with this film but it's also not wall to wall chatter so you can actually appreciate what he's talking about.  Also loved the other extra features - another commentary track with the cinematographer and a 20 minute interview piece.  The story behind this film which is just as interesting as the film itself is fully told on the disc also.  Watch with friends and you'll have a ball!",990057600,5,696,4.484126984126984
1407502,4,B000059OLS,"I bought this DVD mostly on a whim, being a fan of Shatner's.  I had heard nothing about it beyond the fact that it was in Esperanto and was a lost cult classic.  It was an interesting film, an excellent low budget horror film. Certainly a worthy addition to my collection. Conrad Hall shows early flashes of his later brilliance in operating the camera.  Shatner does a good job here too.  The other actors are OK, though you can tell from the most part that they got their jobs because they were friends (or the wife) of director Leslie Stevens (a fact disclosed in the on-disc interviews).  The supplements were nice, better than I expected for a smaller release.  Shatner's commentary, though sparse and occasionally repetative, was informative and funny.  You can definitely hear his personality come through (especially in the thinly veiled egotism and jab at Leonard Nimoy). The interview section was also a welcome addition.  I am glad I purchased this film.  If you are a horror or Shatner fan, you will be too.",989539200,8,1020,4.75
1407503,5,B000059OLS,"This film (on VHS) was shown at last year's Esperanto League for  North America Conference in Atlanta. The diction was good and  the language was accurate if stilted, although the subtitles did  not always correspond to the dialog. Shatner is very good,  without any James T. Kirk evident. This may be the only movie  completely in Esperanto, but ""Idiot's Delight"" with Clark Gable  had dialog and signs in Esperanto, ""Gattaca"" used some I've  heard, and the British TV series ""Red Dwarf"" had some references  to it in the early shows. Amazon.com offers some Esperanto books  for sale, or did last year. It's a real language (my DVD manual lists it as one of the supported languages), although  invented; we prefer the term ""planned"". Anyone interested can find out more at .... Anyway, the movie is worth watching  regardless. See the other reviews about the atmosphere; there's no reason for me to duplicate them.",983232000,4,915,4.915032679738562
1407509,2,B000059OLS,"I found this at the local library and it sounded interesting because sometimes some directors can do a good film on a low budget so I checked it out. I also saw, ""filmed in Esperanto"" on the cover and didn't know if that was a warning or just a statement.

Well, the budget is non-existent, I heard they only used money for sandwiches because the locale was filmed in the countryside by a beach somewhere. We don't know what time period it is or much for that matter, what we do know is that there are evil minions of satan who lure men with their wicked ways to drown in the seas. So, does it sound like a horror film or a Bergmen film, probably it attempted to be both and failed greatly.

Try to forget about the terrible Esperanto language and merely concentrate on the film's deep shadows and camera angles, that is about the only thing this average horror film has going for it. Shatner plays some sort of soldier, from which war we don't know but he lives in the countryside in a small hen farm with his sister who is played by a dumb waif of a lady. So comes along the beautiful witch who wants to corrupt a ""good"" man and Shatner, in his usual overacting and limited abilities, falls in love instantly. The scene is so absurd that I thought it was contrived merely for time purposes but then later in the film Shatner expounds, ""I have loved her for 1000 years."" Corny huh? Yup. We also see his sister get blind after he told her not to look at the eclipsed sun, that was dumb.

The story gets more dull after that, the couple walk hand in hand along the tiring country while repetitive music is played. Looking out for her evil sister, an older witch woman begins to contort evil to lure Shatner to his downfall. Well, none of that works so the two sisters go worship some hanging bat, it was blurry probably because they didn't have enough money for a decent creature and they call up an incubus from the ground and guess what, more budget woes, he's played by a naked man from Yugoslavia named Milos Milos! (who shot some Mickey Rooney's wife in real life and then committed suicide)!

The ending is bland also, after wrestling with a fake goat's head that was painted black, the evil witch becomes good and then it finishes, wow, what a dull movie, especially as it was so overrated by the box, ""Classic horror film found again!"" Reading other people's reviews I was lead to believe that 1) they were too young to understand any of the boring scenes 2) they were drunk or 3) they have no real artistic tastes and are pretentious 4) they are excessive fans of Shatner and refuse to believe he does bad work. If you can sit through this sleep fest, then go ahead but don't expect anything worthwhile.",1390348800,,2711,4.383697813121272
1407510,5,B000059OLS,"I was curious to see this curious gothic horror DVD due to several main aspects. The creators, producers and crew include a number of the same ones as *Outer Limits* ~ after they had gained good experience via that fine dark classic sci-fi series ~ even including the musical composer / director Dominic Frontiere [which I first noticed in *Invaders* via his darkly alien music] ~ as well as being produced by Anthony M. Taylor and written / directed by Leslie Stevens ~ with great presentation ~ via narrator Paolo Cossa and especially cinematography via Conrad Hall and William Fraker. Those last two evoking similar quality alien, stark and quiet *gothic graphics* ~ as the way more famous *Beauty and the Beast*. The [*Big Sur*] ocean, water, weather, visibility, cliffs, hills, trees, grass, religious and secular settings are all used to richly enhance the visual vibes of the *gothic gyre* ~ which is indeed quite *dark* at times ~ maybe even too much for some viewers [**warning**] ~ but completed the *gothic gyre* [for me]. BUT there's also the *fair stars* William Shatner and Alyson Ames and the *dark stars* Milos Milos and Ann Atmar ~ both sets of *stars* in a fine and fun *gothic gyre* [dark dance] mixing together ~ and all four of these vividly evoking their roles. The two *dark stars* even WENT dark soon after production ~ passing away for real [via separate deaths]. SO we miss seeing how Milos Milos and [especially] Ann Atmar could have grown as *stars*.

There are subtitles in English that were re-done over the ones in French [which has a forced-bonus of these subtitles rendered onto black-out strips making them easier to read]. Mysteriously many copies of this film disappeared around the whole world [a number perishing via actual fires] ~ leaving only a few ~ with even an available one in France needing frame-by-frame optical copying and restoration.

==Infamous is when you're more than famous.==

The truth is rather less kind, of course. However famous or infamous Incubus is, that fame or infamy is not due to its worth as a cinematic masterpiece.

Made just before Captain Kirk set off on his three- to five-year mission, Incubus plays like a student film project. (Perhaps an Ingmar Bergman appreciation class?) The score seems lifted from a Classic Trek episode, though the converse is more likely, chronologically speaking. The truth is that the composer's previous work with The Outer Limits probably influenced Trek. Shatner's Esperanto is actually better than everyone else's. Blondie Kia is there because she was married to the director. Just because Conrad Hall did the cinematography does not make it Oscar-worthy. This was his first film; perhaps he learned how *not* to shoot.

Yet Incubus is not entirely without merit. The main theme is provoking even if it is not new or well-realized here. The love-as-weapon motif would of course resurface in Harry Potter.

If you stick this out to the very end, you will be rewarded with some minor amusements. It won't make this worth watching, but the crazy Billy Goat is better than nothing.

I won't even bother with some long review, basically it's a unique satanic film... the fact that it's in esperanto only makes it all the more strange and unique. The acting is decent, and once again the fact that Shatner is in it makes it all the more bizarre. The cinematography is ok, strange enough to make it worth a view every now and again. In the end if you accept satanic themed movies and like horror films this would do nicely in any collection.

This was the most painful 76 minutes I've ever spent in front of my television.  Incubus was just plain awful.  From the wooden acting, to the music which attempted to be atmospheric but was simply annoying, to the lame plot, and on to the dreadfully pronounced Esperanto.  This may be a cult classic but I can't figure out why.

INCUBUS is a popular Esperanto-language film, which is often advertised as 'the first totally-Esperanto-language film.'

I bought this DVD because of curiosity, and the want to own some film in Esperanto to show to friends and curious acquaintances.  I received a strange, beautifully crazy film.

Don't buy this DVD if you're wanting an example of spoken Esperanto.  Buy it to have a little piece of Esperanto history.",1286755200,4,845,5.642857142857143
1407515,5,B000059OLS,"I bought this movie as a used movie by chance last year for about $3.33(get three used movies for $10 at a local pawn shop).  I was impressed with the strange esperanto and the rarity of the movie, considering it was supposedly a lost movie until about a little over a decade ago, I mean, I hate hearing about movies being lost forever.
Anyway, in this dvd package, there is interviews with two guys, can't remember their jobs, I think it was producers or some such, and the audio commentary separate with William Shatner.  I believe it was William Shatner who mentioned the curse this movie might have been considered to have, that the woman who played shatners' sister, she dies very soon after the movie was released, by suicide.  The actor who played the incubus, Milos Milos, he kills the former wife of Mickey Rooney then kills himself within a year.  Of course as others mentioned, a child of the older sister of the young succubus charactor loses a child to an abduction/murder within a couple of years with I believe no solving of who did it, some divorces, convictions, etc, along with all copies except one, disappearing, probably into private collections somewhere(probably where folks used to gather around in dark cloaks next to black candles and such watching an old film copy of this most likely to see if they feel more rich after it).
But I digress, the curse is probably working on me as well, since I purchased this movie used, I have continually purchased very old movies on dvds to add to my collection costing me too much money I almost wished I had spent on other hobbies, truly a curse, I mean, I can't seem to stop, even at tax time or when all the insurances are due I'll buy more old movies,... I buy movies to give me that eery feeling I felt when I watched Incubus, ha, well, maybe I am just naturally cursed to enjoy good ole classic movies, or movies such as this tht could have been lost forever if not saved.  Ha, of course, I paid $3.33 for the movie, and if you multiply that by two, you get that famous 666 number, so indeed I am cursed, well cursed to spend loads more cash on various old movie collections, ha ha.
Esperanto, wow, now that is an interesting way to dialogue a movie, probably will never be done again, unless some folks get together and try to do it again, and from what I've seen, one can purchase the books to learn that language right here on Amazon.com.  Ya know, that is what is missing in modern times, that there aren't really any low budget movies being done like there were back in the 60's when I was born, I mean it seems they either have to cost ten million dollars to produce or they just aren't done, unless the chinese start doing them and selling them at wally world mart.",1285113600,2,2742,4.441351888667992

1407517,5,B000059OLS,This is a fantastic film.  William Shatner is an amazing actor.  His ability to convey emotion even in Esperanto is really very impressive.

1407519,5,B000059OLS,"For many years, 1965's legendary horror opus INCUBUS was thought to be a lost film. Some years after its production, the original negatives and prints were carelessly discarded or destroyed by the film lab entrusted with their preservation, and knowing of no other extant copies, the filmmakers resigned themselves to the idea that their award-winning work was forever gone. But in the mid-1990s, INCUBUS producer Anthony Taylor learned that the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que Franaise in Paris had discovered a copy of the film in their archives. He subsequently negotiated to have a high-quality copy made, and from this a digital master was created. And now, after missing for more than 3 decades, INCUBUS is again available to eager genre fans.

INCUBUS is set in Nomen Tuum, a village on an idyllic island that also happens to be the hunting grounds of two succubae (beautiful female demons that seduce human males and lead them to ruin). One of these demons, Kia (Allyson Ames), has lured countless IMMORAL men to their ultimate doom, but she is growing bored with beleaguering those who are already marked for damnation. She yearns instead for the challenge of seducing and corrupting a man of noble character. However, her mentor, Amael (Eloise Hardt), warns that toying with saints is a dangerous game, as they wield a strange power that can corrupt even a demon's heart--a power called LOVE. Rejecting this advice, Kia sets her sights on Marc (William Shatner), a respectable young war hero who lives with his sister, Arndis (Ann Atmar).

In the guise of a weary traveler, Kia accosts Marc, and he is immediately attracted to her. She feigns mutual interest, of course, and when Marc kisses her, she tempts him with the suggestion that they make love. But being of good character, Marc insists that they first do the ""right thing"" and marry. Such principled moral restraint intrigues Kia, and she begins to fall in love with Marc.

Outraged by Marc's ""corrupting"" influence, Kia's mentor, Amael, summons the titular incubus (the male counterpart to the succubus) and sends him out to avenge Kia by defiling Marc's sister. But as Kia's love grows, Marc wins her over completely, and this turn of events only further enrages the incubus and thereby places both Marc AND Kia in peril.

INCUBUS is an excellent horror film that belies its meager budget. Neither sensationalist nor exploitative, the simple tale of good-versus-evil is accessible to an audience of almost any age or nationality, yet it is not a shallow or boring film. Indeed, the excellent acting, the beautifully aesthetic cinematography, and the eerie religious symbolism and psychological subtext keep the viewer continually engaged as the narrative unfolds. And even after 40 years, the film does not seem the least bit dated. Natural settings, rural architecture, and simple wardrobes give the film a timeless, fairytale-like quality.

INCUBUS is often cited as a mere curiosity because it is the only film to date in which the characters speak solely in the artificial language of Esperanto. (Created in 1887 by Ludovic Zamenhof, Esperanto is based on the common elements of the European romance languages, which are themselves rooted in Latin. A relatively easy-to-learn language, Zamenhof naively hoped that Esperanto would become a universal tongue that would promote world peace.) Limiting the film's significance to this one characteristic, though, is both inaccurate and unjust. It can easily be argued that, along with its contemporaries like CARNIVAL OF SOULS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, INCUBUS is one of the watershed horror films of the 1960s that greatly influenced the evolution of the genre. Although containing a certain level of creepy imagery, these films contain relatively little blatant gore. Instead, the primary horror element of each is an eerie ambiance created via symbolism; atmospherics such as lightning, thunder, and fog; copious nighttime photography; unusual lighting and camera angles; odd musical scores; and the use black-and-white film. And rather than being a mere curiosity, the use of subtitled Esperanto-only dialogue in INCUBUS is an additional aesthetic masterstroke. It provides a certain foreign flavor that, regardless of the nationality of the audience, contributes to the film's ethereal atmosphere by making it seem as if all takes place in an unfamiliar or alien realm.

INCUBUS was the brainchild of Leslie Stevens, a producer, writer, and director for the classic 1960s sci-fi TV series THE OUTER LIMITS. Leslie wrote and directed INCUBUS himself, and he assigned the primary camera duties to another OUTER LIMITS alumnus, future-award-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall. The influence of the TV show is recognizable in several elements of the film, the most obvious being the theme-music pastiche. Surprisingly, this musical style works even better in INCUBUS than it did on TV, as the bizarre sound of the theremin on which it is played sharpens the otherworldly quality of the film.

Overall, INCUBUS deserves its legendary status. It's a must-see for any serious fan of the horror genre or for fans of STAR TREK's William Shatner, and with DVD technology, such fans now have the opportunity to own a copy of a great film that was once thought to be forever lost to the dust of history.

NOTE: For serious film collectors, the authorized (by the film's producer, Anthony Taylor) DVD from Winstar (click&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incubus/dp/B000059OLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incubus</a>&nbsp;for amazon's product page) is probably a better option than the DVD offered here.  The Winstar edition offers a restored version of the film, two audio commentaries--one with star William Shatner; one with producer Anthony Taylor and cinematographers Conrad L. Hall and William Fraker--and other interesting bonus material.",1247875200,6,5897,5.366486486486487
1407520,4,B000059OLS,"This was a simple, odd but thoroughly spellbinding little film. Leslie Stevens [director], Conrad Hall [3-time Oscar winning cinematographer] and Dominic Frontiere [music] of OUTER LIMITS [1963-1965] fame are behind this one. It sort of plays out like an extended Outer Limits episode. All about a succubus [female demon who preys upon men] who gets tired of corrupting ""tainted"" or bad guys and wants a greater challenge---to corrupt a 'good' guy. Her victim, Marc, is a recovering war-hero played by William Shatner. The setting is a remote rural village reknowned for its healing waters where Marc, accompanied by his sister, has gone to convalesce from his war injury/trauma. The obscure healing sanctuary is fertile ground for predation, attracting the needy but often naive faithful. The dialogue in this film is in the artificial constructed language of esperanto which gives the film a very unearthly and stange atmosphere. Allyson Ames plays the succubus named Kia---she is intriguing and provocative throughout. However, she is warned by an elder she-demon that good men are capable of expressing and using something called ""love"" that can harm her. She scoffs at the warnings and goes on her way soon encountering Marc and his sister. Kia's arrival is followed by a solar eclipse which seems to portend both Kia's dark side but also a benign side [her human side?] as grazing cattle do come in during the dimming interposition and do not stay or gallop further out as they would if she were pure evil. After Marc, who is captivated by her, ""defiles"" her by making love to her the confused femme fatale attempts to procure revenge by summoning the dev himself. Bill should'a known this babe wasn't right when he asked her something having to do with love and having a soulmate and she replied: ""I don't have a soul"". This is just not something everybody puts down in their life-partner application. The dev sends an incubus [male demon who preys upon women] to settle things. He is expulsed from the ground in eerie fashion and goes on to attack Marc's sister and then battles Marc. The latter manages to ""kill"" the incubus but is himself badly wounded and struggles toward his Church. Kia, who is now irrevocably in love with Marc, follows but is attacked by the resurrected incubus who is transformed into an unsettling black ram. Both Marc & Kia, prone & wounded, reach out for each other's hands and Kirk---I mean, Marc---pulls her into the presumed safety of the Church with the ram staring at the two, its image emblazoned on the screen as the movie ends: good winning out over evil? More likely a reminder of the perpetual human struggle between good [i.e. spirituality/selflessness] and evil [i.e. excess/egoism], between conviction and temptation, and of the price of human heroism. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this unusual film. As is typical of Stevens and his Outer Limits episodes the setting is a benign, even beautiful [forest & ocean] place that yet conveys an uneasy sense of isolation and alienation, the latter resonating in the stoic, inscrutable faces of the protagonists. The perpetually pained look on Marc sister's face throughout was noteable. The great Hall b&w cinematography, the esperanto lingo, the Frontiere music all contribute to a uniquely eerie, metaphysical experience. I was glued to my seat. The subtitles positioned almost into the middle of the screen were annoying, making the viewer savor silence early on, but you do get used to it. I purchased this DVD and am proud to have it in my collection as the film is simple but unique and evocative and just something to be experienced. Interesting how demonic sexual assault, as suggested in this film, was dealt with in spectacular fashion only 3 years later with the landmark ROSEMARY'S BABY, [1968].",1246665600,2,3801,5.006319115323855

This movie was very well done.  I was interested primarily because it's entirely spoken in Esperanto, but the pronounciations are off.  Still, it was a beautifully done black and white movie, if ""beautiful"" can be used to describe a horror flick.

The film's in black in white, which actually adds to the atmosphere.

The language spoken is Esperanto, which kinda/sorta/not really sounds like Spanish. I've just shown an interest in the language and I was able to pick up a few words here and there.

I thought the photography was really good: Some very creepy-looking trees and creative points of view.

The English sub-titles are really huge, which can be bad in that they block a lot of the screen. On the good side, the large text makes it easy on the eyes as far as reading goes. There is not a whole lot of dialog and there are quite a few times when there is a long stretch of no dialog at all.

I'm 27 and I personally found this film to be quite enjoyable--it's certainly one of the more creative movies I've seen and the general storyline is quite intriguing.",1210118400,5,1053,4.3520408163265305
1407523,4,B000059OLS,"From the producers of the original ""Outer Limits"" TV series, came this strange, airy, otherworldly horror film. While Leslie Stevens helmed the production of the TV series, and Joseph Stefano (Psycho) basically ran the productions, the series was abruptly (and decidedly unwisely) cancelled, but Leslie took to the Director's Chair for this one. He insisted that Esperanto (a mish-mash of several languages, combined into a cohesive whole, that was once put forth as an ""International Language"") be spoken, and it lends to the eerie goings on. Both he and Stefano chose Big Sur, California as the site of filming, and the locales chosen were, likewise, perfect for the film's ""feel"". The film boasts a very small cast, essentially made up of unknowns, with the exception of William Shatner, Who was to gain fame some years AFTER this film, by becoming Captain James T. Kirk, of ""Star Trek"" fame.

The rest of the cast did well, with maybe the one exception, being Eloise Hardt. I apologise to Eloise for this, but her command of Esperanto was seriously flawed, like trying to speak spanish with a New England accent. It just doesn't work. Allyson Ames (who, herself was once Leslie Steven's wife, and was cast in a few of the series' episodes) plays a novice Succubus. Ann Atmar (who would regretfully take her own life, a few years after ""Incubus"" was made) plays Shatner's sister, and Milos Milos (who could forget that name) plays the title role.

While the plot is a simple one, ""Good Vs. Evil"", the performances should be taken in the context of the 1960's. Much has changed, in the way of ""modern"" acting, and if this film is judged by it's modern contemporaries, it is woefully lacking. If taken by the time of it's production, however, it works, and works well! There is Religious allegory in the film, but it has no identity, other than a cross shown in an old ""Spanish style"" mission. The photography was helmed by Conrad ""Connie"" Hall, who is noted for his work on films like ""In Cold Blood"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" and he won an Academy Award for his work on ""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"". The visuals, though black and white, are stunning! There is a scene where Shatner is walking across a field of grass, and it's how the grass moves, in black and white, that makes the scene stand out! I doubt the same effect could have been repeated, were it in color! There are scenes such as this, all through the film! The music was arranged by Dominic Frontiere, who did all the soundtracks to all of the series' episodes. So if you are a fan of the ""Outer Limits"", you will recognize the music, as ""Incubus"" possesses just about all of the music done for the series! Strangely, it works! The subtitles in this film are the one serious flaw, in an otherwise excellent film. They are superimposed on a black background, closed caption style, and obscure what is on the lower third of the screen. It is disconcerting to some degree, as you cannot see the faces of the actors in some shots.

The film is not without some comedic element, though. In a scene where Shatner and Ames are crossing a shallow stream, Shatner trips and falls, face first in the water! Like true troupers, though, they both  adlib lines, that I'm positive, were NOT in the script! In Esperanto, even!

While the DVD has no extras, if you happen to be a fan of the old ""Outer Limits"" series, as I am, this will make a fine capper to that series, as both Stevens and Stefano wanted to do a new series based in Gothic Horror, that ABC execs at the time, were not keen to do (this should come as no great surprise, as TV execs were as stupid then, as they are today). So if you are looking for a great little Goth/Horror film for that boring evening, try ""Incubus"". It's a good one!

This addendum is added on Jan. 17, 2010:

After reading up on the history of Daystar Productions and the actors in the film, I found some interesting info. It seems the film had it's own ""curse"", a la ""Poltergeist"". Eloise Hardt's young daughter was kidnapped and murdered in L.A. shortly after the film was made. Ann Atmar committed suicide WEEKS after the film's completion, not years, as I commented previously. Milos Milos murdered his girlfriend, then did himself in, also shortly after the film's completion. Dominic Frontiere was convicted of extortion, if I'm not mistaken, a few years after the film's completion (though I do not really consider this part of the ""curse"", because he knew what he was doing, and knew it was illegal). Leslie Stevens was also not immune, though for him, it was not a death, but divorce from Allyson Ames, she stating that being with Stevens became excruciating, because life in the Stevens household was driving her crazy.

Also, a bit on the subtitles: All copies of the film were lost or destroyed over the intervening years, except for one, the last one, copy existing in France. It was remastered by SciFi Channel. Leslie Stevens was adamant about NO subtitles except English, for the film, which was summarily ignored by the French company that bought the copy. Since the French subtitles could NOT be removed, without destroying the film, black boxes were superimposed over the French subtitles, and English ones placed in the boxes, which is what you see. This explains the unwanted obstruction the subtitles cause.

None of this affects the way I view the film however, nor should it for you. ""Incubus"" is one of Daystar Productions' best (next to ""private Property"", with Warren Oates and Kate Manx, Stevens' second wife, which I am in the process of procuring, as soon as a copy becomes available).",1209427200,4,5696,4.767748478701826

- Conrad Hall

Conrad Hall, who shot this film (cinematographer, not director), was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won three before his death in 2003. He won Oscars for his work on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Beauty, and Road to Perdition and is one of the masters of the art (obviously). I've seen many of the films he lensed but to me, nothing - absolutely nothing, compares to his stunning black and white work in the long lost low-budget horror film, Incubus, from the mid-60's.

Hall got his start in the classic original Outer Limits TV series in the early 60's. After the show was canceled, Hall, along with many others from the talented crew from The Outer Limits followed its creator, Leslie Stevens, to his next project, Incubus, a low-budget horror film he scripted with dialog entirely in Esperanto.  Esperanto was intended as a ""universal second language"" developed in the 1800's. Accentuating the beauty of the poetic script, and astounding imagery, is the eerie and perfectly-fitting score by. Dominic Frontiere.

The script itself is spartan and beautifully written.  This is not a ""talky"" film and the dialog sounds more like poetry. The story has a mythological nature to it, like some Greek fable about star crossed lovers. As Shatner points out in his commentary - despite its poetic qualities, it really is a take on the common ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"" structure and is a ""dark"" (like ""pitch-black"" dark) love story. The beautiful succubus, Kia, is unfulfilled in her ""job"" luring men with her beauty, only to kill them and sacrifice their souls to the Lord of Darkness. Such men will ""find their way to the sewers of Hell without her"".  She wants to sacrifice a virtuous man.  She is warned by her elder, Amae, not to do this as virtuous men posses a power greater than their own.  Not heeding this warning, Kia meets Marc (Shatner) in the woods where he lives alone in a cabin with his sister, Arndis.  Marc falls under Kia's spell, and after Marc and Kia ""fade to black"" Kia remains unconscious. Marc carries her to a church, and when Kia awakens there is traumatized by the religious items and that she's (gasp)a succubus in a church. She fights like an animal to be released from Marc's grasp, and succeeds by scratching his face, then flees into the woods.  The traumatized Kia is met by her elder, Amae, where they agree to resurrect the Incubus - a demon, to exact their vengence on Marc for defiling her by having the Incubus rape his sister and feed her soul to ""The Lord of Darkness"".

Nothing - no scene, in this film lapses into campiness. The scenes of Satanic ritual are not hokey and corny as we come to expect in these types of films. They are  executed with a powerful authenticity. Once of the best sequences in the film is the ""transformation"" sequence at the end of the film where the Incubus goes from his human form to his demonic form. This is done with a simple and effective ""jump-cut"", sound, flash cuts, and clever editing. No unconvincing and cliched ""disolves"". It is elegantly, brilliantly, executed and very, very realistic and effective. I would defy any modern digital ""morphing"" effect to match the effectiveness of this scene executed with a simple ""jarring"" jump-cut.

Incubus is not a ""curio"", not a dated hack horror flick, forget about ""William Shatner"" jokes (he's perfectly cast in this), and it's certainly not one of those ""so bad it's good"" camp-fests. Incubus is an eerie and effective horror that's unforgettable.  It grabs you by the lapels from its brilliant title sequence, and doesn't let go for a second until its poignant conclusion.  It's truly a forgotten film treasure. I'll go out on a limb and - to me- declare it a masterpiece created by the inspired labor of love by some of the very best filmmakers of its era.",1191110400,,3911,4.730882352941176
1407525,3,B000059OLS,"I have to admit that I bought this mainly because of the dialogue in Esperanto. Although I would not call myself an Esperantist, I know the language quite well and take a general interest in constructed languages, and I think Esperantists are far too critical of this movie. Sure, a lot of the dialogue is poorly pronounced, but William Shatner and one or two others manage the language quite well, and I cannot understand why a dedicated Esperantist would not at least want the movie in his collection. As fantasy-horror, it is passable, and shows some imaginative camera work, and is of reasonable picture quality, considering its age.",1183939200,3,637,4.907407407407407
1407526,5,B000059OLS,"If you enjoyed the 60s TV series THE OUTER LIMITS, then you'll probably get a kick out of this film. This movie has the same feel of the best of the episodes of OL. There's a constant feeling of dread, as if the hand of Fate is always about to fall upon the various characters who move across the screen. The cinematogaphy is shadowed enough through the use of black and white photogrpahy to lend a further air of impending doom to the affairs.

Spoken entirely in Esparanto (with English sub-titles), the movie is not at all difficult to follow for those viewers who are neither familiar with the artificial language, nor accustomed to sub-titles. The acting is surprisingly good, and the casting was quite effective and all players seem extremely well suited for their roles.

INCUBUS is quite an excellent film and I feel confident in recommending it.",1174953600,2,854,4.724832214765101
1407527,4,B000059OLS,"Before he was Captain Kirk on TV's STAR TREK, William Shatner did some brilliant and disturbing work in both TV and independent/small budget film. He appeared on THE TWILIGHT ZONE and did a seriously sinister turn as a racist preacher in the Roger Corman film THE INTRUDER (also known by the title SHAME, which is how I first saw it on VHS). His role as the virtuous man Marc in INCUBUS, this wild 1965 film from OUTER LIMITS creator Leslie Stevens, is equally strange and very daring. More than the gimmick of watching pre-TREK Shatner, however, this is a truly creepy and unnerving film about the primal fears of life/death, heaven/hell, soul/abyss, etc.

While this film transfer is crisp and clear, I do have a complaint about it. All the film's dialogue was spoken in the made-up language of Esperanto. Here, you can't switch off the English-language subtitles so as to lose yourself in the surreal vibe you get from watching everyone talk to each other and not necessarily understanding what's being said. The best you can do on this DVD version is switch to French subtitles - even there, the words get in the way of the picture so that's an added distraction.

Still, it's a wonderfully dark and fascinating film and certainly far more thought-provoking than the average viewer might think of a film featuring Shatner in the months before he took over the Enterprise.

P.S. -- Watch for a young Robert Fortier in the opening moments of the film. For those in the know, Fortier played a number of roles in the films of Robert Altman throughout much of the 1970s (you may remember him best as the sad-eyed drunk who gratefully takes Warren Beatty's whiskey flask in 1971's MCCABE & MRS. MILLER).

OK, so get this DVD -- all ye who care about film. And let's collectively hope they may someday produce a version of INCUBUS on DVD that doesn't use any subtitles at all - just Esperanto, all the way.",1168300800,3,1903,4.6716417910447765
1407528,5,B000059OLS,"This film was made for almost no budget by the folks who worked on ""The Outer Limits"" and it sure feels like an OL episode. As for the Esperanto, if you are use to watching movies in foriegn languages, this movie will be no problem. It is a very good job for such a meager budget and the actors tried quite hard to look convincing spouting a language they probably never even heard until they signed up for the job.

There are also two audio commentary tracks. One by the production staff and one by Shatner. Shatner's track is worth the price of the disc alone and gives you an insight into his sense of humor, his work ethic in the early days and what it was like to work during the golden age of the ""B-Movie"".

They tempt wicked men and deliver their souls to Hell.  But one feels it would be far better to tempt those that are not already wicked.  She sets her sights on Shatner despite the protests of her peers.

But the warnings are true.  Associating with the truly good man has corrupted the demoness.  To save her, her peers raise Incubus to destroy the man's sister and drive him to murderous violence.  But will it be enough to curse him?  Will the demoness return to full evil or will the taint of good remain?  What happens when the God of Darkness gets involved?  You will have to watch to see how it gets resolved.

This is an Italian film and the dialogue is in Italian with English subtitles.  If Bergman had decided to do a film about Good versus Evil, it might have looked something like this (although I think Bergman would have had a budget for a larger cast and more sets).  The action takes place in the country where we see the great outdoors, Shatner's house, a church, and an abandoned property.  Considering that out demoness sends three souls to hell before lunch one has to wonder where the people are and where they live.  But that issue is minor as the story drags you in and you stop noticing the lack as they are not necessary to the story.  If you like your films full of atmosphere, brooding and moral dilemmas then you might want to check out this oft-overlooked film.  Check it out.",1162684800,,1549,4.413427561837456

listened to this film,

in a language that I had never heard before, yet somehow understood.

After about 15 minutes of viewing,

during which time I ruled out Romanian, Romanish, and Catalan;

I concluded that what I was hearing must be ""Esperanto"".

I eagerly awaited the credits at the end of the film, which ultimately confirmed my suspicion.

The effect of grasping the gist of an unknown language was eerie and disturbing,

and heightened the overall disquieting nature of the plot, cinematography, location, and musical score.

This is an interesting film, especially for someone who is fascinated by languages and their interconnections.

My objection to this reissue is that there is no unsubtitled version, so that the viewer can just watch the images and allow the mind to flow along with the Esperanto dialog,

seeing how much one can understand.

In addition the subtitles are unfortunately placed rather high on the screen, and are surrounded by a black text box which often blocks out the actors' faces.

But the reason for this is apparent when one learns that the only copy of the film that was preserved was a French-(text box)subtitled version.

Apparently those responsible for getting the film back into circulation did not feel that applying the digital ""fix"" necessary to remove the text boxes and restore the obscured frames was worth the effort.

But it is still worth seeing.

For a film that was obviously ""made on the cheap"", this work has an abundance of artistic merit.

""Incubus"" is from the same talents that brought us the first ""Outer Limits"" television series. ""Incubus"" writer and director (...as well as Esperanto buff...) Leslie Stevens was Executive Producer of ""Limits;"" and he directed a few of the episodes, when the likes of Byron Haskin or Gerd Oswald weren't behind the cameras.

""Incubus,"" shot at Big Sur, looks and feels much like a ""Limits"" episode, due in large part to the striking camera work of Conrad Hall, who also worked on the series. Also, the musical score of ""Incubus"" by Dominic Frontiere features not only original music but recyclings from the ""Outer Limits"" soundtracks.

I mean, considering it's supposed to be the Easiest Language Evar, you'd think they could have at least picked up the *pronunciation* in the time it took to shoot the film.

The overall concept is at first a rather interesting and original twist on the usual corruption tale, where the demon is the one ""corrupted"" by love. Unfortunately, the movie eventually chickens out of its role reversal, and turns into a standard ""evil is bad""  plot. If not for this, I could have forgiven the overall hokeyness of the dialogue, but as it is it's simply a rather unremarkable horror flick.

Well, the budget is non-existent, I heard they only used money for sandwiches because the locale was filmed in the countryside by a beach somewhere. We don't know what time period it is or much for that matter, what we do know is that there are evil minions of satan who lure men with their wicked ways to drown in the seas. So, does it sound like a horror film or a Bergmen film, probably it attempted to be both and failed greatly.

 Try to forget about the terrible Esperanto language and merely concentrate on the film's deep shadows and camera angles, that is about the only thing this average horror film has going for it. Shatner plays some sort of soldier, from which war we don't know but he lives in the countryside in a small hen farm with his sister who is played by a dumb waif of a lady. So comes along the beautiful witch who wants to corrupt a ""good"" man and Shatner, in his usual overacting and limited abilities, falls in love instantly. The scene is so absurd that I thought it was contrived merely for time purposes but then later in the film Shatner expounds, ""I have loved her for 1000 years."" Corny huh? Yup. We also see his sister get blind after he told her not to look at the eclipsed sun, that was dumb.

The story gets more dull after that, the couple walk hand in hand along the tiring country while repetitive music is played. Looking out for her evil sister, an older witch woman begins to contort evil to lure Shatner to his downfall. Well, none of that works so the two sisters go worship some hanging bat, it was blurry probably because they didn't have enough money for a decent creature and they call up an incubus from the ground and guess what, more budget woes, he's played by a naked man from Yugoslavia named Milos Milos! (who shot some Mickey Rooney's wife in real life and then committed suicide)!

The ending is bland also, after wrestling with a fake goat's head that was painted black, the evil witch becomes good and then it finishes, wow, what a dull movie, especially as it was so overrated by the box, ""Classic horror film found again!"" Reading other people's reviews I was lead to believe that 1) they were too young to understand any of the boring scenes 2) they were drunk or 3) they have no real artistic tastes and are pretentious 4) they are excessive fans of Shatner and refuse to believe he does bad work.

very interesting!  one reviewer found the pace and cheesyness of the esperanto and the simplicity of the dialog and story to be boring...which i guess is valid, but i chose to surf on the atmosphere of this one....and atmosphere there is no shortage of here.  the chessyness helps somewhat.  i like that it seems a bit like a crackpot bergman.

also of interest is that it presents a kind ""satanic"" morality.  the older succubus is genuinely concerned about the younger kia's ""falling"" into the ""grips"" of goodness.  i'd have thought that followers of satan would be somewhat competitive or spiteful of even each other, by nature of evil itself, however these satanic followers seems quite bonded and empathetic to each other and very devout to the devil and fearful of god.  i thought that this movie presented ""evil"" as having nearly the same values as ""good"", just a different perspective.  i've always thought by nature of darkness, that a true satanist should ""hate"" satan, as hate would be the great expression of evil.  but then again maybe that explains why so many christians ""hate"" the devil....'cause they're really satanists!

ok i digress.  check out this movie if you like something a little strange.  it's not really a horror film, but a kind of odd 60s art film that wasn't and can't be reapeated.

1407550,5,B000059OLS,"For many years, 1965's legendary horror opus INCUBUS was thought to be a lost film. Some years after its production, the original negatives and prints were carelessly discarded or destroyed by the film lab entrusted with their preservation, and knowing of no other extant copies, the filmmakers resigned themselves to the idea that their award-winning work was forever gone.  But in the mid-1990s, INCUBUS producer Anthony Taylor learned that the Cinmathque Franaise in Paris had discovered a copy of the film in their archives.  He subsequently negotiated to have a high-quality copy made, and from this a digital master was created.  And now, after missing for more than 3 decades, INCUBUS is again available to eager genre fans.
INCUBUS is set in Nomen Tuum, a village on an idyllic island that also happens to be the hunting grounds of two succubae (beautiful female demons that seduce human males and lead them to ruin).  One of these demons, Kia (Allyson Ames), has lured countless IMMORAL men to their ultimate doom, but she is growing bored with beleaguering those who are already marked for damnation.  She yearns instead for the challenge of seducing and corrupting a man of noble character.  However, her mentor, Amael (Eloise Hardt), warns that toying with saints is a dangerous game, as they wield a strange power that can corrupt even a demon's heart--a power called LOVE.  Rejecting this advice, Kia sets her sights on Marc (William Shatner), a respectable young war hero who lives with his sister, Arndis (Ann Atmar).
In the guise of a weary traveler, Kia accosts Marc, and he is immediately attracted to her.  She feigns mutual interest, of course, and when Marc kisses her, she tempts him with the suggestion that they make love.  But being of good character, Marc insists that they first do the ""right thing"" and marry.  Such principled moral restraint intrigues Kia, and she begins to fall in love with Marc.
Outraged by Marc's ""corrupting"" influence, Kia's mentor, Amael, summons the titular incubus (the male counterpart to the succubus) and sends him out to avenge Kia by defiling Marc's sister.  But as Kia's love grows, Marc wins her over completely, and this turn of events only further enrages the incubus and thereby places both Marc AND Kia in peril.
INCUBUS is an excellent horror film that belies its meager budget.  Neither sensationalist nor exploitative, the simple tale of good-versus-evil is accessible to an audience of almost any age or nationality, yet it is not a shallow or boring film.  Indeed, the excellent acting, the beautifully aesthetic cinematography, and the eerie religious symbolism and psychological subtext keep the viewer continually engaged as the narrative unfolds.  And even after 40 years, the film does not seem the least bit dated.  Natural settings, rural architecture, and simple wardrobes give the film a timeless, fairytale-like quality.
INCUBUS is often cited as a mere curiosity because it is the only film to date in which the characters speak solely in the artificial language of Esperanto.  (Created in 1887 by Ludovic Zamenhof, Esperanto is based on the common elements of the European romance languages, which are themselves rooted in Latin.  A relatively easy-to-learn language, Zamenhof naively hoped that Esperanto would become a universal tongue that would promote world peace.)  Limiting the film's significance to this one characteristic, though, is both inaccurate and unjust.  It can easily be argued that, along with its contemporaries like CARNIVAL OF SOULS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, INCUBUS is one of the watershed horror films of the 1960s that greatly influenced the evolution of the genre.  Although containing a certain level of creepy imagery, these films contain relatively little blatant gore.  Instead, the primary horror element of each is an eerie ambiance created via symbolism; atmospherics such as lightning, thunder, and fog; copious nighttime photography; unusual lighting and camera angles; odd musical scores; and the use black-and-white film.  And rather than being a mere curiosity, the use of subtitled Esperanto-only dialogue in INCUBUS is an additional aesthetic masterstroke.  It provides a certain foreign flavor that, regardless of the nationality of the audience, contributes to the film's ethereal atmosphere by making it seem as if all takes place in an unfamiliar or alien realm.
INCUBUS was the brainchild of Leslie Stevens, a producer, writer, and director for the classic 1960s sci-fi TV series THE OUTER LIMITS.  Leslie wrote and directed INCUBUS himself, and he assigned the primary camera duties to another OUTER LIMITS alumnus, future-award-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall.  The influence of the TV show is recognizable in several elements of the film, the most obvious being the theme-music pastiche.  Surprisingly, this musical style works even better in INCUBUS than it did on TV, as the bizarre sound of the theremin on which it is played sharpens the otherworldly quality of the film.
Fox Lorber's DVD is top-notch.  There are many interesting extras, not the least of which is an often humorous feature commentary with the film's now-famous star William Shatner. Of course, the restored version of the film looks wonderful, with blacks that are truly black and crisp whites. Admittedly, the English subtitles are sometimes obtrusive. This is due to the unfortunate fact that the surviving copy of INCUBUS has French subtitles that are, pragmatically speaking, impossible to remove, and this requires the English subtitles to be placed in such a way as to blot out the existing ones.  This DOES sometimes block more of the image than is ideal; it DOES NOT prevent overall enjoyment of the film. (The French subtitles are optionally available on the DVD, and they are less visually intrusive than the English--a benefit, of course, only to those who speak French...or Esperanto.)
Overall, INCUBUS deserves its legendary status.  It's a must-see for any serious fan of the genre, and with this DVD, fans have the rare opportunity to own a beautiful copy of a great film that was once thought to be forever lost to the dust of history.",1077667200,7,6164,5.173038229376258
1407551,3,B000059OLS,"This lost 1965 cult classic features a pre-Star Trek William Shatner as a morally righteous man who becomes the target of a beautiful succubus whom has grown weary of seducing tainted men.  Mistaken largely for a foreign film because the dialogue is in Esperanto (Incubus was filmed in California), the film manages to use it's low budget to it's advantage and is heavy in gloomy atmosphere and mood setting music.  The acting isn't too bad, although many of the actor's pronounciation of the language isn't anything to write home about.  All in all, Incubus is worth a look for older horror fans who remember the days when it didn't take loads of blood and gore to scare an audience.",1076284800,,684,4.73109243697479
1407552,4,B000059OLS,"Incubus is a chilling, riveting story in any language. The only disappointment is the quality of the Esperanto used. There are mistranslations and misusages, and sometimes some very bad pronunciation. One of the female actors in particular uses a flat, U.S. accent. And in one instances, she asks Shatner ""Chu chi tio estas via lando?"" to mean, ""Is this your land?"" What she was actually asking is, ""Is this your country?"" If she wanted to know if it was his property, she should have said something like, ""Chu chi tio estas via terpeco?"" (literally, ""piece of earth."").
I have been tempted to redo the Esperanto dialogue for this film, and someone could really have done so as an alternative audio track on the DVD. Supply better translations in certain parts, and speakers who have a good international pronunciation with pure vowels and melodious intonations. Maybe the DVD can be released again later with these improvements? It was very obvious to Esperanto speakers that the actors themselves were not fluent users of the language, but then watching the film did supply a source of amusement.
Meanwhile, we should give praise to the bonus interview (in English) attached to the DVD. It is very informative and enlightening about the ongoing history of this film.",1073606400,,1268,4.985849056603773
1407553,5,B000059OLS,"Incubbus is a classic story about the conflict of good vs. evil. William Shatner plays the good protagonist that is confronted by a woman demon that entices weaker men into the sea as an offering to the dark lord. I think fans of the Twighlight Zone and fans of early Polanski films will really enjoy this low budget thriller. This was also one of the scariest films I've seen. The film is shot in Ingar Bergman style black and white, and the soundtrack accompanying the films is really a nice touch. The use of Esparanto gives the film even a more chilling effect. Also, if you read about the curse of the film that affected the actors and the crew after this film wrapped it really leaves you feeling a little bit unsettled. I strongly recommend this film.",1072137600,,758,4.5
1407554,4,B000059OLS,"Incubus is a unique horror movie that has long been lost due to a peculiar chain of events that are worthy of their own film.
The only movie ever filmed entirely in Esperanto, Incubus inverts traditional horror sensibilities, presenting our world from the point of view of a group of demons.  The linguistic device might have hampered lesser efforts, but here, it succeeds in conveying a parallax nightmare atmosphere.  Filmed in Big Sur circa 1965, Incubus used much of the crew responsible for TV's Outer Limits.  The only problem with the DVD presentation (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the transfer source is a worn french theatrical print (the only print currently known to exist).  While restored nicely, the print has irremovable french subtitles.  This isn't too obtrusive on its' own, but it presents an obstruction problem when english subtitles are superimposed over them.  Also, the DVD is full-frame not widescreen.  However, due to the strange circumstances that have followed the films production, this is likely the only way we'll ever get to view it.  Despite any flaws in presentation, Incubus will prove a revelation for fans of unusual horror films like 'Carnival of Souls', 'Daughter of Horror', or 'Night Tide'.",1070409600,2,1252,5.043689320388349

Kia is getting weary doing this too simple of a task and she decides to lure someone who has not sacrificed their soul.  Against her sisters advice, she ends up trying to charm Marc (William Shatner), who is a good and caring man.  The plan backfires and in anger Kia summons an incubus to take care of Marc.

While the dialogue in its entirety is not free-flowing, that of Shatner and Allyson Ames is delivered considerably more realistically than any of the highly stilted Latin of the better known art film ""Sabstiane"" (1976).

It is, in fact, a pious legend - the story of a demon from hell converted by the power of pure love (theologians may frown a little at is, but there are many similar legends). The images are strange and dark and haunting, and William Shatner radiates a purity und untainted, virtuous virility that shows there is (or was) more in him then just Captain Kirk.

What makes it so appealing is that William Shatner stars in it.  No ""B"" fan has greater love than to see a well known and respected actor appear in a ""B"" movie...back in their youth...back when they had hair.

1407561,4,B000059OLS,"INCUBUS displays the sort of combined taste and discrimination that is these days so often lacking, especially for fantasy and horror films.  Credit Dominic Frontiere (music), Leslie Stevens (story and direction), and the exceptional Conrad Hall, who provided what may be the best argument ever for the necessity of using black and white for ""le cinema de fantastique"".  A morality play, yes, as one of the other critics mentioned.  But each frame and sequence is a new startlement of shadowy textures and pearly, glowing highlights under Hall's photographic wizardry, and the Esperanto language, as musical at times as Italian or Spanish, lends a poetic music to even some of Stevens's most declamatory interludes of dialogue.  A young William Shatner plays the Stoic hero of quiet valor as a foil to Allison Ames's rapacious demon hunting for a ""good soul"" to corrupt; the result is an unexpected love story with an apocalyptic ending.  This is a film in the first order of magnitude, with those such as THE INNOCENTS, SECONDS, and PSYCHO, abetted by Hall's photography, but also, with Frontiere and Stevens, textured like one of the better episodes of THE OUTER LIMITS (from which most of the talent came). INCUBUS argues for the need of movies to be more than just widescreen television.  Without modern CGI effects and, it should be added, contemporary vulgarity and paltry aesthetics, INCUBUS reminds us all what sublimity can be reached through stories of the fantastic.  Unquestionably, INCUBUS is worth the price of purchase.  Those that found and restored this film have brought back an important cinematic artifact of 20th-century film.",993427200,7,1647,5.165413533834586
1407562,5,B000059OLS,"I remember seeing this film in college back in the mid-seventies, and it struck me as one of the strangest movies I had ever seen. The Esperanto dialogue fits in perfectly with the otherworldliness of the film. It seems that Director Leslie Stevens was paying homage to his Outer Limits partner Joseph Stefano by making one of the most Gothic themed motion pictures ever. The film has may haunting scenes perfectly framed by cinematographer Conrad Hall--two of the creepiest are when a coven of succubi are walking ever so slowly on a beach and the scene where the Incubus is summoned is a sequnce worthy of horror grandmaster James Whale.
The DVD edition has a wonderful interview with producer Anthony Taylor and cinematographers Conrad Hall and William Fraker. Their commentary track is very good. I was EXTREMELY impressed with William Shatner's commentary track. Listening to Mr. Shatner talk about the ""curse of the film"" is especially chilling. My only fault with Mr. Shatner's commentary is that he wasn't joined by someone like David Schow (the renowed OUTER LIMITS expert). I think a dialgue between these two would have been fascinating. Schow has written extensively on Incubus, and the website (for the movie Incubus) links to his commentaries. The DVD is truly a chilling and fantastic experience!",990403200,25,1311,5.074074074074074

The atmosphere is dreamy and haunting and spooky, the black and white photography is strikingly beautiful and the spiritual theme is meaningful.  William Shatner and Allyson Ames look great and the warm chemistry between them seems genuine.  The appeal of this movie is bound to be limited, however.
