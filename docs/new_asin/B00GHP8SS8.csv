6076915,5,B00GHP8SS8,"This is an excellent series and one we all enjoy very much. I managed to get all the issues before when they were finally released but his complete set is the BEST way. I bought them as a gift for a family member who had not ever even heard of Due South. Excellent production, great music, and story lines.",1399939200,,306,4.203389830508475
6076916,5,B00GHP8SS8,I watched this show when it was originally aired and enjoyed it as much then as now.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys entertainment.,1398470400,,136,4.44
6076917,1,B00GHP8SS8,"Do not buy this version. Even though the box and the first disk claim to include the pilot episode, the pilot is missing.",1397001600,23,121,4.304347826086956
6076918,3,B00GHP8SS8,I guess for the price I couldn't expect a lot but it's fairly ridiculous the way the menus are laid out.  Instead of being able to pick individual episodes you get mostly blocks of 2 or 3 episodes.  There are of course no extras and the picture quality is like someone taped it off a VCR in 1994-1996 and transferred it to DVD at a discount shop.  The show is still good and I guess unlike my older DVDs they do play.,1521072000,,417,4.060975609756097
6076919,5,B00GHP8SS8,Love the series. It's great to have good entertainment.,1520467200,,55,5.222222222222222
6076920,3,B00GHP8SS8,"The quality of the picture is just fine. The lack of stars is for the way this DVD is setup. All episodes are included, but it is a pain to get to a specific episode. They are linked together in a string of 3 episodes at a time, which are divided into 2 parts per title. That means if you want 1 of those episodes, you choose the 3 titles at once, and then if its say the 2nd or 3rd episode you want, you have to start watching the 1st episode, and then skip forward however many times to the that episode. Its a pain, especially if you don't remember which episode you last watched.",1520121600,,583,4.0344827586206895
6076921,5,B00GHP8SS8,I absolutely was content with my Due South dvds . I really enjoyed spending the days watching them. I suggest everyone get the series. Thank you a great investment,1519344000,,163,4.655172413793103
6076922,5,B00GHP8SS8,"I gave this copy to our niece, who lives near Chicago, where the series is set.  It`s difficult to imagine this many yuks per buck.  Watch it!

If you enjoy Paul Gross, check out Slings and Arrows, about a struggling Canadian Shakespeare festival, of which Gross is the artistic director.  Co-written by Susan Coyne, who also appears in the series and is currently co-producing Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle,  Slings and Arrows offers some of the same hilarious views of fundraising as MitJ does, from the north-of-the-border perspective.

I mean the headline of this review in the kindest way -- no sarcasm implied.",1519344000,,616,4.932038834951456

6076925,4,B00GHP8SS8,"Due South: The Complete Series DVD | Box Set:
Complete Series DVD Box Set implies that there would be some sort of collector's quality to it, but there is not. This is the strangest packaging I have ever seen. First of all, there is no box. You get 2 standard DVD cases each with one very deep spindle that holds 4 discs! So you would have to take them all off just to get to a disc at the bottom of the stack. But wait! It gets even weirder! They have merged [often] three episodes into one with no differentiation in the menu! So, if you want to see for example, the episode called ""Starman"", you would have to get one of the discs for Season 2, (it does not tell you even what disc it's on - only that it's there somewhere) and once you find it, you have a selection that says, ""We Are The Eggmen / Starman / Some Like It Red"". Those are three episodes rolled into one menu selection, so you would have to select it and then forward your way to the episode you wanted. Right now I am watching from beginning to end, so it doesn't matter much, but after this, what a pain it's going to be to watch specific episodes! It has a bootleg/knockoff feel to it and not by someone who knows how to write chapters!

The video quality is just okay. It's SD. (Standard Def) It's only going to be as good as the source and that's what they had back then.

The series is charming. Reminiscent of more innocent times. No blood and guts. Lots of character. Just like our great neighbors to the North. Clever writing which includes lots of nuggets that would get past most Americans. Thank You Kindly Paul Haggis and Paul Gross. Okay, David Marciano too. Good chemistry, but what really happened???

I think it fell apart at the end though. It's almost like they thought they were going to lose the contract and threw a bunch of stuff together to fulfill the existing one. Glad to have it. I would love to have an actual collector's edition box set with menus that really work! This was the least they could do.",1514073600,,1997,4.277777777777778
6076926,2,B00GHP8SS8,"Love the show., if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, you would too. The review is purely about the disc quality.  The discs are pretty glitchy. I started on season two because i own S1 and had just finished watching it. The first three episodes are very glitchy. I had to miss half of each episode. I haven't checked the rest of the CDs but honestly who would want to after messing with this mess. Pretty annoyed. Not sure if I have a lemon or others have the same experience.",1513209600,2,474,4.1521739130434785

6076928,5,B00GHP8SS8,another one of my daughter's favorite shows that isn't available elsewhere,1511049600,,74,5.818181818181818
6076929,4,B00GHP8SS8,Enjoyed it. Quirky. The early episodes are better.,1510099200,,50,5.375
6076930,3,B00GHP8SS8,"My previous complete set went missing, so I purchased this as a replacement. I should offer a warning - the encoded files on this set (all discs divided between two normal dvd cases, stacked together on a single peg in each) are significantly lower quality than the prevoius set I owened (packaged in a larger mass case with individual pegs for each disc.)

I mean, significantly, drastically compressed video quality - previous set was approximately 1.5gb per regular episode, this set is approximately 500mb or less per episode. Episodes are literally 1/3rd the quality of previous dvd releases. Significant visual distortion and image loss is visible in all scenes, in all episodes, at all times. It is a tremendous pity to see such a magnificent series treated so shoddily, with so little regard by the manufacturer. Due South is such a uniquely funny, quirky and touching show; while it really deserves a proper blu-ray restoration, maintaining at least the quality provided by previous releases should be a bare minimum expectation in this day and age.

I've own VHS and Laser Discs with higher quality transfers than are in evidence here. A shameful disappointment to fans of the show, old, new and yet to come.

Buyer beware. 5 stars for the show, 3 stars (or less - I can't bare to rate the series lower) for this set.",1510099200,2,1327,4.8370044052863435
6076931,5,B00GHP8SS8,I loved this series when it was on TV.,1509408000,,38,3.3333333333333335
6076932,5,B00GHP8SS8,Quirky Canadian series about a Canadian Mounted Policeman's adventures in law enforcement in Chicago.  Fun to watch on a snowy winter's day with a fire in the fireplace.,1508025600,,169,5.035714285714286
6076933,5,B00GHP8SS8,Bought as a Christmas gift.,1505260800,,27,4.6
6076934,4,B00GHP8SS8,"There is nothing like Due South on TV. Who can forget the unimpeachable Mountie and his part-wolf sidekick? Unfortunately when it was on, I was unable to see every episode, so it was worth it to me to get the entire three seasons for one reasonable price. There were 9 missing episodes, however, which caused huge gaps in the story line. Still, there were numerous unforgettable moments and funny lines.

I bought this for around $16, including shipping, and the quality of the disks is questionable. Some of them skipped and hung. (This is probably due to the cheap packaging.) But the worse thing about the order was that 9 episodes from the second season were missing. (Luckily, that season is available separately, so I can order it.)

That said, if you love huskies and real heroes, this is a show you can't miss. You may wish to pay more and try to get the seasons separately rather than in one package, but if you're a bargain hunter, this is still a pretty good deal.",1504569600,4,975,4.565714285714286
6076935,5,B00GHP8SS8,"I liked this series, hadn't seen any episodes for years.  It was a treat to watch.",1504310400,,82,4.125
6076936,2,B00GHP8SS8,"The show is great but the DVD production - the menus, layout, video quality, and presentation are all pretty awful.",1503532800,,115,4.8
6076937,5,B00GHP8SS8,This series was too short in its original run.  Even with replacing one of the main characters part way through the original run.  The packaging and CDs are what they should be.  I don't know what else to say.  I love the series and I am happy with my purchase.,1502668800,,261,4.16
6076938,2,B00GHP8SS8,"This review is about the DVD set -- NOT the series. I love, love, LOVE Due South the TV series.

I bought this DVD set as a ""backup"" set to the 5 separate DVD sets I already had from the original releases of Due South on DVD, just in case anything ever happened to it. (Seasons 1-4 plus the two-part Call of the Wild series finale.)

I really wanted to like this complete set. I looked forward to having all seasons and Call of the Wild in one complete set in two DVD cases, instead of my previous complete set spread across 5 DVD cases, each purchased individually.

Unfortunately, as is often the case with DVDs, especially DVDs of TV series -- you get what you pay for (and I paid $10.99 with free Prime Shipping).

This DVD set is from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. And it is of very poor video quality. Yes, I know there are limits to what can be done with original 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows in this day of HDTV, UHD, and Blu-Ray, etc. -- but there is a right way to put a 4:3 aspect ratio TV show on DVD, and there is a wrong way. Echo Bridge chose the wrong way.

The de-interlacing was done improperly. The picture quality is poor because the video compression is high -- that's what happens when you compress the video so you can fit 6 to 9 episodes on each DVD. There is pixellation of the image in some spots, and multiple discs I had skipped. I was able to rewind back over the skipped areas, and see the skipped footage. But this speaks volumes about the quality of the video and the discs themselves.

Due to the poor video quality, the DVDs actually look better on my old DVD player than on my Blu-Ray player.

That's because Blu-Ray players tend to ""upscale"" the video image of non-Blu-Ray discs. Unfortunately, upscaling a poorly compressed, shoddy video conversion only enhances the flaws -- it doesn't improve the picture quality, it makes it *worse*.

This DVD set actually looks like a slightly better-than-amateur bootleg in terms of visual quality -- as if they used Handbrake or something to rip the video from the original DVDs, then reconverted and compressed to fit more episodes per DVD with some other open-source conversion/compression/DVD burner software. Actually, I'd bet money that that's what they did -- and that's why they can sell it so cheaply and still make a profit.

The disc menus don't allow you to choose to view one episode at a time. You can only choose 2-3 episodes at a time (and you must move between them with your chapter-advance button >| ). That's fine for pivotal two-part episodes (such as the 3rd and 2nd to last episodes of Season 1, Victoria's Secret Part 1 and 2). But it's lousy if you want to skip around to different episodes, because then you have to use the chapter-skip button to go past episodes you don't want to watch if the episode you want to view is 2nd or 3rd in a block of 3-4 episodes.

There are no subtitles on this set. The originally released DVD sets had subtitles in English (and French, of course -- it's a Canadian-produced show shot primarily in Toronto, with only location shots in Chicago). This set doesn't even have the subtitle info. So you can't use your TV's CC (closed captioning) to get the closed captions/subtitles, either.

All in all, this is a hack job. The original set was much better. But since those are no longer available, I guess this is better than nothing. Makes me cherish my original set that much more, though. Glad this is my ""backup"" set and not my ""real"" set. Also very glad I didn't pay much for this set. It's not worth the original list price of $29.99, I can tell you that much. $10.99 is about all it's worth.

That being said -- if you can watch this on an older DVD player (not a Blu-Ray), the adventures of Constable Fraser and his two Chicago cop friends Ray and Ray are pretty entertaining. For the most part, it's one of those lovably quirky (Canadian) shows from before that was a thing. It is appropriate for family viewing.

But despite being appropriate family fare -- one might say deceptively appropriate family fare -- for sharper adults, there's plenty of unresolved sexual chemistry, deeper themes and hints, and the usual cop buddy tropes done with some unusual flourishes Canadian style. Some fans didn't like the changes made by Paul Gross, who plays Constable Benton Fraser and became executive producer in Season 3 (and 4)... but some fans liked the changes quite a bit. Your mileage may vary.",1500681600,6,4443,4.53875
6076939,5,B00GHP8SS8,Great. One of the best shows I have seen in a while. The characters are wonderful,1498435200,,81,4.125

6076941,5,B00GHP8SS8,"This is an excellent-quality DVD set for the price.  The video is crisp,and audio is excellent, although there is no CC and there are no subtitles [I don't need either one, so it's not a big deal for me].  I watched Due South on American television in the '90s, and this video seems to be much clearer than it was on TV. (I know other reviewers have said it's slightly grainy, but then I am not watching on a massive screen, either.)  All the episodes are here, including the ones only shown in Canada.  You do have to watch them in bundles of two or three episodes, but again, you're getting 67 full episodes for 11 bucks.  It can be difficult at first to play all the episodes in order; the DVDs are stacked on top of each other, so you have to shuffle them, and the episodes are not numbered on the DVDs. I would rather deal with some quirks at this price than pay $20 per season for a premium DVD.",1495929600,,901,4.184971098265896

6076944,3,B00GHP8SS8,"The series is, as ever, wonderful, funny, and has stood up well with time.  This is a great place to get all the episodes in one set for a good price.

This DVD set has some serious issues.  There is no captioning track included, or even a captioning track for your TV to pick up. There is also no French or Spanish language track for bilingual viewers.  Also, please note, the picture has not be enhanced or refinished, so you are getting a slightly grainy image that looks a bit faded.",1491609600,2,487,4.318681318681318
6076945,1,B00GHP8SS8,"The series is fantastic, but this particular DVD set is completely awful. I purchased from Amazon and the DVDs were completely unplayable. Straight out of the package, can't be read by any dvd player. Probably has something to do with cramming four or five dvds into a stack in what would usually hold one. So this set is a complete waste of money. You should get the show, but find a different set somewhere else.",1490313600,,414,4.533333333333333

No chapter makers within episodes, so can't skip forward or back within an episode -- have to use fast-forward or fast-rewind. Also, episodes grouped together, so 2, 3 or 4 episodes play in a row -- can't select single episode. But hey, only paid $11!",1486684800,,426,4.4743589743589745

But more problematic is that the discs come in 2 flimsy, plastic boxes with 4 discs on one spindle.  2 discs wouldn't load at all, 1 had bad skips. Didn't even try the others.  Buyer beware: there's a reason it's so cheap. Previous individual series are slightly more expensive, but don't seem to be so poorly made.

6076962,5,B00GHP8SS8,"Paul Gross (Republic of Doyle) is an incredible actor. I remembered this series as I watched Republic of Doyle the first time. I saw it was not available for streaming so I ordered it at a screaming deal. This is a binge watching series. Paul Gross has an incredible acting ability to play the straight laced RCMP (Canadian Mountie) without it being corny. You know how the lame Clark Kent in the Superman movies is really 2D? Well, Paul Gross makes his character 3D. Being the son of a Canadian Armor Officer he has the mannerisms down pat. Having worked with two RCMP officers in my career I can say they ARE professionals and a real joy to work with. There is one show with Leslie Nielsen (Naked Gun) where there are signs of Frank Drebin coming through but it still works. This is a cop-buddy show but with much better writing. Incredible writing actually. Filming was done mainly in Canada with some exteriors of Chicago (I was living there at the time) but heck CSI Miami was shot in LA! Defenbakker (the deaf wolf) is played by so many dogs it is actually fun to watch the subtle differences in his/her coat. Family show.

The music fabulous, especially when Gross trotted out his stuff.  Lots of little gems can get easily get away from you.  Examples are names: 3rd season partner Ray's full name, and his wife's name, and when he yells it.  Inspector Thatcher's name.  Reference to a character ""...bearing a remarkable resemblance to Canadian actor ------ -------""  Gotcha! You have to watch it.

I bought the 67 episodes and the pilot was there.  There are different versions available of Due South so check the episodes listed.  I had no problem with quality or missing episodes.  The DVDs only went up to Season 3. But, the Season 4 episodes were all there.  Just listed as ""Season 3"". I checked with a movie database to compare titles.  Watched every one of them and remember the plots as described.  The quality of the DVDs was great.  I have a Toshiba BDX5200KU that's about four years old.

6077003,5,B00GHP8SS8,This collection of an old TV series is wonderful. I had forgotten how much my family had enjoyed watching it originally. It's about one Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman who is on loan to the Chicago (I think) police department. The interaction between the two departments brings many laughs and drama.

Any suggestions?",1435276800,5,318,4.229508196721311
6077005,5,B00GHP8SS8,"A great series that suffers from being both too short and not having enough writing effort to keep it going. I also suspect that it was so short because it just didn't have enough of the usual shoot-em-up of its contemporary cop shows and didn't get the ratings to survive.

Definitely get it. Then have a bowl of popcorn & pop the DVDs into the player and go.

PS. WARNING: There are two episodes per index mark on the DVDs! So, each playing cycle is about 90 minutes and comprises two distinct episodes run together.",1433980800,,518,4.442105263157894

6077009,3,B00GHP8SS8,"This is a five star show, and the price is a great deal but I would only rate this set 3 stars for the low picture quality and poor menu. My wife bought me the show on DVD many years ago, at the time they were very expensive. She bought all the seasons separately and the pilot wasn't included until season 3's set.  I love this show so much that I often recommend it for friends and so when I saw that the entire series, including the pilot, was available for $9.99 I jumped on it so I could have a second set of DVD's to loan to friends.

The series does come with all the episodes including the pilot on a total of 8 disks. They are packaged in two cases, 4 to case, stacked on top of each other.  The packaging art is just odd, hard to describe, as the first case has cover art on the front and season 1 and 2 episodes list on the back but the second case has no cover art but rather season 3 episode lists on the front and a summery of all three seasons on the back. The next odd thing is that episode selection on the menu is weird because you have to select two episodes at a time. There is no way to watch the second episode you select without selecting them both which starts the first episode and then fast forward or skip ahead until the second episode starts.

Finally the picture quality on this set is very poor. I compared them to my older set by watching the same scenes from my older set and this one and there is significant drop off of in picture quality.  I have to say this is the most disappointing aspect of the set.

So the positive of this set is that the entire run of Due South is included here on DVD for about $10.00. For the price I suspect many might consider it worth it despite the poor picture quality and odd way episodes are selected in the menu. I am writing this review only so others can make an informed decision about if the great deal in the price for the entire series in one set is worth the reduced quality.  Again, the show itself is FANTASTIC and I highly recommend it.",1433116800,7,2016,4.0886075949367084

6077025,5,B00GHP8SS8,"Loved this series from the first episode back in the mid 90's.  I was one of those who followed it around... made it a point to find it on the weekly schedule no matter how CBS tried to hide it.  So I came upon it again in a round about way.  Being an audio freak, i was combing through the CD's at one of the local Goodwill stores that i frequent in search of music gems.  And whadda ya know, Bada Bing Bada Boom... the soundtrack to this TV hidden treasure appears.  $1.99... WHAT A FIND!

So if i can find this, how 'bout the original TV series.  A quick jump on Amazon and two days later I'm in TV nirvana. Ordered the 67 episode complete series. Will reserve my right to re-review, but it looks to all be here. Previous reviewers have bemoaned the fact that not all episodes are included, but my ""Complete Series"" seems to be complete.

As for quality of video and audio, I have no complaints.  Playing the DVD's through a Sony Blu-Ray BDP-BX320, the connected Samsung LED 36"" displays the video images beautifully.  In watching through an older RCA BRC11072E Blu-Ray player connected to a older Panasonic 42"" Plasma, the video quality is just a tad bit grainy, but not distracting by any stretch.  And in both cases the audio is outstanding.

Well written, well acted, intelligent and fun.  Paul Gross, David Marciano, Ramona Milano and certainly Diefenbaker the Wolf, not to mention a bevy of supporting actor surprises from Teri Polo to Mark Ruffalo to Leslie Nielsen just in the first season! Best $20 you'll ever spend.  Miss this series at your peril!",1427500800,,1562,4.5321428571428575

When tracking down his father's murderer he meets up with a total opposite Ray Delvecchio  . In the course a deep and mutually respectful  friendship develops. Through the ups and downs of their comedic adventures Benton seems clueless of the women throwing themselves at him You have a variety of name guest stars appear Leslie Neilson, Milton Berle, and the character act William Smith (great for playing bad guys). Despite CBS's best efforts to quash the series it managed 3 seasons and a 4th in syndication.

6077029,4,B00GHP8SS8,A great collection of a great underrated series at a very good price. The only criticism is of how the discs were authored.

6077033,3,B00GHP8SS8,"First off, if I was reviewing the show itself, I give it 5 stars. Love Due South!

Now, this specific boxed set. Mine does have the pilot episode. However the picture quality is truly horrible. It's almost unwatchable unless viewed in the ""normal"" aspect ratio, which puts two vertical black stripes on either side of the screen. I would assume that absolutely no up-scaling or remastering was done for these DVDs. To be fair, it doesn't say anything about remastering, it's quite a shock to see how grainy it is. Possibly I should have held out for the other boxed set on Amazon, which was out of stock when I purchased this.

And last, I know prices on Amazon go up and down, but the price went down about $6 from when I ordered it to now, less than two weeks. That just makes me bitter, and not particularly happy with Amazon. I guess I can never make an impulse purchase here anymore, since it is much smarter to put it on my wishlist for a few weeks and just wait for the price to drop.",1421884800,9,991,4.32258064516129

The Pilot is listed on the back of the case and advertised heavily here, and listed on disc 1. But it's not on the discs. I checked every single disc to make sure it wasn't hidden elsewhere, but it's not there. The first disc that says Pilot starts right off with the episode Free Willie.

The quality is actually worse than watching the episodes on YouTube, too. On the whole, extremely disappointing, even for $14. I wouldn't recommend buying it. Save your money or buy the real thing from Canada.",1419120000,8,608,4.527272727272727

This DVD set was a great price. It may not have all the bells and whistles of newer DVD sets but having the simple format allowed them to squeeze a ton of episodes onto each disc. Saves a lot of room on the movie shelf. Very happy with this purchase.",1417219200,,493,4.189473684210526

Good variety between episodes, does not bother trying to get all deep and philosophical about the actors (though obvious when they wanted to kill ones off - almost like the ones leaving had an X on their back for a few episodes before) - basically just easy watching.",1416787200,,481,4.415730337078652

i opened it up on the way to the car and was thrilled they used the quad flipper tray cases.i have read that people say the Pilot is missing on their dis when in fact the pilot is there on mine the pilot is over 90 mins on my disc which would be about right since most premeries where 2 hours long(with Commercials)
Video Quality is Decent from what i have watched of it so far
I gave this 4 Stars Cause the Menus On Mine Are Lame they are generic blue and i like everyone else wonder why they put 2 episodes per title which makes no since whatsoever",1412294400,,674,4.0
6077047,4,B00GHP8SS8,"I feel the need to weigh-in here, to clear up (?) the confusion about the episodes on this set. The reviewers seem a bit mixed on what's in here - probably because it depends. I carefully ordered from the ""67 Episode"" version site on Amazon - I not wanting to risk missing the pilot nor ""Chicago Holiday"" pts. 1 and 2 (the other sometimes-missing episodes). But when it came, the package proudly proclaimed ""65 episodes"" (NOT 67 as the site photo displayed). And the back sleeve listed the pilot (that was good), but not the ""Chicago Holiday"" pair. Slightly freaked and not happy, I stuck the critical first 2 discs in my DVD to see what was up and...well...it was all there: the pilot (which WAS listed on the cover) and the mysterious Chicago Fire episodes (which were not). My suspicion is that the collection originally omitted them, probably due to incompetent production, but they later fixed it on the discs, but didn't change the outer sleeves (due to different incompetent production). If that's the case, an earlier ""65 episode"" package may not include the 2 missing episodes or perhaps the pilot. My disc labels state 2011 copyright, while the package states 2013. This strains my ""older artwork"" theory - but I'm sticking with it. Hopefully, all the versions for sale on Amazon these days, regardless of what the package says, are likewise complete.

I gave this 4 stars due to the analog TV quality video - perfectly acceptable - not awe-inspiring.",1412035200,59,1461,4.7976190476190474

I don't understand where those reviews are coming from since it looks exactly as it did on the tv in the 90's, that;s just how the series looks! besides, it's not as if its bad or distracting from the show in any way.
now to list the many good features of this product! first is that the price is so so so worth it. as a college student, money can get tight, and when i first found this series, i knew i wanted to watch all of it. When i get to spend on frivolous things that have nothing to do with my classes, i tend to really scrutinize them, but for the price i absolutely couldn't pass this up! this has to be the best frivolous purchase I've made in a long time!
Next, the box came like lightning speed, which always makes me happy! to be honest, when i first opened the package and was greeted with an extremely thick case that resembled that of a VHS i panicked a bit and began to fear that i had accidentally ordered a VHS, however upon opening the case i realized that inside was not a VHS, but several DVDs! this set has so many DVDs in it and lasts for hours of fun and suspense!  sometimes after classes i watch this long into the night to relax and de-stress, as it provides many good laughs. i know people are complaining in other reviews that this set does not include the pilot episode, and that is true. However, i was able to find it on several occasions on you-tube, so it's not as if it's not on this DVD it doesn't exist. anyway, this is a perfect box set and i thank the seller for that immensely.
Finally, the show itself. I absolutely adore this show, it keeps you entertained for hours on end! (which is not always a good thing when you have papers to write but watch this for hours instead!) it's funny, thought provoking, and evokes many different emotions. it sometimes makes you question your way of thinking and leaves an imprint on your heart. i love Paul Gross, and have always wanted to have Diefenbaker as a pet! i would recommend this to anyone twenty times over, i love Canada, love Mounties, and love Paul Gross, if you do too, this is definitely the show for you! I'm so happy i made this purchase and i'd do it all over again!",1409356800,13,2316,4.216216216216216
6077051,5,B00GHP8SS8,"Only watched the last season which I had missed on TV, so thoroughly enjoyed that.  But because of the disc problem with Slings and Arrows am worried about the quality of the 1st 2 seasons discs.",1407888000,,195,4.416666666666667

6077053,3,B00GHP8SS8,"The discs are mislabeled.  Disc one does not have the Pilot on it, which has made all of the other DVDs one episode off. We're on disc 3 so far. Hoping the pilot is actually on the third season discs like in the original issue.  I have all the seasons in various formats, so this isn't an issue for me, but there is definitely something wrong here.",1406851200,19,348,4.17910447761194
6077054,4,B00GHP8SS8,"I just received my copy of this set today.  I have already watched the Pilot and Final Episode (Call of the Wild 1 and 2) so this set does have all episodes.  The navigation format is slightly strange (2 episodes in a chapter) and the video quality is slightly grainy, which is probably because these DVD's were copied from VHS or standard definition video.  Regardless for the cost, it's great to watch this series.  I remembered watching the first 2 seasons growing up so it's very nostalgic.  Worth the price I paid, but 4 stars due to the video quality.",1404864000,10,557,4.53
6077055,5,B00GHP8SS8,Never seen it before though the Views I'd read said it was a good show. I was pleasantly surprised and am glad I bought it. I now have a much better view of Canadians now thanks to this show.,1404518400,,191,3.923076923076923

8623355,5,B00GHP8SS8,"Love this clean series that has a lot of humor that you have to closely listen for. We have to adjust our tv to watch it since this was not made for High Def. Love it anyway and enjoy every one. Can't beat an overly polite Canadian mounty who owns a deaf wolf who lip reads and understand commands extremely well. The Canadian is teamed up with a thin Chicago Italian detective who has the total opposite personality. They are funny together and continuously ""Get Their Man or Woman."" I highly recommend this series of videos.",1528848000,,526,4.489583333333333

8623359,5,B00GHP8SS8,"My daughter who now lives in Canada found out about this series from her friends and we both started watching it when I visited there late last year.  I dimly recall when it was on TV here but for some reason never watched it.  What a loss!  This series was great and it is better than half what is on today.  In typical CBS fashion, the network didn't do right by this wonderful series and it should have been on for many full seasons.  Paul Gross is amazing and hilarious and always just right as the Mountie and though the first Ray was my favorite, both Rays have their merits and hold their own.  The first episode of Season 3 with the new ""Ray"" was absolutely laugh out loud funny.  Apparently, some reviewers at the time thought the series couldn't decide whether it was comedy or drama yet I found it a totally appropriate mix of both.  What a shame we didn't get more episodes!

No wonder Paul Gross has had a great career and I look forward to watching more of him in the future.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates wit and intelligent humor.  Bravo!",1524528000,,1082,4.36
8623360,1,B00GHP8SS8,This DVD set is defective. We have only been able to watch one episode. Others would not even open. One of them kept stopping with green squares popping up continuously. And the two par episode only showed part two. We could see the end but had no idea what was going on. I was very anxious to see this set but we delayed watching it until we finished the Monk series. Consequently it is too late to return it and I am afraid to reorder it for fear it will be the same..,1524182400,,470,4.064516129032258
