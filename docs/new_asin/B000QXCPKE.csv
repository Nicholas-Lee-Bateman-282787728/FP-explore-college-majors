8296547,1,B000QXCPKE,I was gone to buy this but after reading more about this item i notice that it is only a CD not the XO Laptop itself so i did not buy it. They should have done clearer job if putting that this is not a laptop but only a 60 minutes cd about the xo laptop.,1331164800,,254,3.5535714285714284

8296551,2,B000QXCPKE,"We really wanted this laptop to work--for our child, as a birthday gift, and for another child in the world, who, presumably, would need it more than ours.  We received it in December and it has been a colossal flop.  Hard for children and grownups (very computer-literate grownups) to navigate.  The child cannot use it--she ends up in tears of frustration.  The adults were looking forward to using it, even the Linux system--but no.  No go.  How do I return this thing?  I hope there is support for the other child in the world who got this thing--we are unsupported, unhappy, and have only a cool looking green paperweight here in our home.",1215475200,7,644,4.646017699115045

8296553,1,B000QXCPKE,"First I thought the one laptop per child would be a wonderful idea ... so I ordered one from the website, and sent one to a under-privileged child somewhere.  I wanted to see for myself what this device would be like, and if there was any useful software development to be done on it.

I got mine about a week ago, and it is terrible.  It is way too slow.  There is no documentation ... except on the web ... and it is far too poor and useless.

The device is a nice size, but the keyboard and keys will be problematic, I guess this is so one can only type very slow so the device can keep up ... my toy computer of 20 years ago was better than this and cost about the same.

I am sorry to say but I have to predict that this idea is going down in flames.  It will be worse than useless to children and everyone who has anything to do with it.  Not even a nice try.  What a sad waste of time and materials.",1199059200,10,906,3.880434782608696
