8489515,5,B005Z9MG2Q,"I might quibble about the ""Live in Concert"" title of this DVD ... the term ""Live in Concert"" does not bring to my mind a recording session in a tiny studio surrounded by curtains, with an audience of 14.  I might quibble but I would not deduct any stars.  The artistry is superb, and the camera work is sensible for a change--most of the time we are looking at the performer's hands.  And what a treasure trove of Brahms, far more than can be digested at one or two sittings.  One could quibble over a few small matters but overall I must say:  Highly recommended.",1409443200,,564,4.333333333333333
8489516,3,B005Z9MG2Q,"As usual Rose plays beautifully, my only problem is with the setting or sound stage.  It's quite apparent that this was a made for video recital but would have been nice had Yamaha chosen a nice recital hall or auditorium instead of this small & dry sounding room.  I originally purchased this to try out my new Bluray player because it wasn't too expensive but find my self wishing I would have purchased another ""real live""  performance that had some historic qualities and ambiance.  Lastly the piano sounded electric and smaller than a concert grand of course at the fault of the manufacture and room, those horrid curtains sucked what little life that was left out of that piano.",1398556800,,684,4.722689075630252
8489517,4,B005Z9MG2Q,"This comprehensive set of many of Brahms' major works for solo piano has proved to be an interesting experience to watch, listen to and also to comment upon as here. Jerome Rose, in his address delivered straight to camera as a bonus feature, explains that he has been playing this music for around 50 years having started when a teenager and as a young man. At that point he was a similar age to that of Brahms when he wrote his 3rd, and last, piano sonata which starts the recital here.

Jerome Rose brings a mature and considered manner to his stage presence and approach to the keyboard. The overall impression projected is one of serious and considered control. This extends to his acknowledgement of the applause from his very small audience. This live set of pieces seems to have been performed in a small room in front of about 20 or so people of mixed ages.

These observations of serious and mature control are helpful to understanding this deeply considered set of interpretations. It informs his responses to the descriptions for each piece. So words such as `maestoso (majestic), expressive (with expression), grazioso (graceful), andante (moderate speed) and risoluto (with resolve) are all accommodated easily within his concept. Words such as energico (energetically), agitato (agitatedly), vivace (lively) and passionato (passionately) are more problematical when this very controlled approach is applied.

The choice of piano is also interesting. Rose plays on a Yamaha instrument which has a fuller and more rounded tone to that of the more commonly used Steinways which have a far brighter tonal range. This choice suits the interpretations well.

To try and make some valid comparisons it is worth considering rival performances of note on CD. The younger Kissin brings a youthful drive and energy to the sonata which is not to be found here. Rose may have learnt the piece when he was as young as Brahms when he wrote the piece, however he is no longer that age and what we hear is the mature interpretation of an older man.

Choosing to compare with a man of a similar age such as Stephen Kovacevich there are considerable differences of a similar nature. Kovacevich brings a drive and intensity to his playing that can occasionally verge on aggression. Passion and excitement are evident everywhere. Those wilder emotions are kept at bay by Rose and will not be experienced here.

Everything is played in a strong and controlled manner. Every detail is laid out for us and we are made aware of every rhythmical complexity in the part writing. The left hand consistently brings out the strong bass foundation so important for Brahms. Speeds are moderate throughout which enables all of these details to `tell'. The result is satisfying but somewhat emotionally compromised.

The imaging is clear and a variety of camera angles are used to create visual interest. This is very imaginative bearing in mind that the piano is positioned on a small stage and directly in front of full length curtains which prohibit any shots from the opposite side to the audience. The sound is in stereo only but this is of very good quality giving faithful reproduction of the Yamaha instrument used.
I enjoyed this set of performances finding them to be satisfying rather than exhilarating. For those excitements I shall go to Alexeev, Angelich, Argerich, Gilels, Hough, Katchen, Kissin, Kovacevich, Osorio and Richter to name but a few in strictly alphabetical order.

In view of the comments above I feel that this deeply considered and generous set of performances is more of a 4 star rather than a 5 star issue. It should give plenty of satisfaction but it is not the only way to play Brahms.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I have been considering this Blu-Ray for some time, and now your excellent Review popped up on my Wish List!
Frankly, I am still undecided, so I'll let it percolate through my Subconscious a bit longer...
Thanks for your input! (U.K. review)
