8327448,1,B001NN79ES,"I bought this for the Liberace christmas show. Unfotunately this doesn't seem to be a christmas show...in fact, at one point he mentions easter and another scene has him playing the piano with a couple of skeleton marionettes dancing on his piano. The show is just him playing the piano and it's not really a christmas show. It looks like a transfer from a VHS tape. Very boring. Its black and white (poor video quality) and he only wears a tux. The cover is not a reflection of what he wears in this video...this video is from his TV show not his Vegas days when he wore really flamboyant costumes.",1230595200,3,599,4.454545454545454
