7799193,4,1578071372,"Uncle Matty is reconized by many for his PBS specials and Animal Planet shows. I have seen him live in Boston. This video is one of his many training videos. Seeing celebrities having some of the same dog problems we do can be amusing. Uncle Matty uses an ""Uncle Matty's proud"" line with the dogs. It can make you giggle or cringe. When you see that the voice works on the pooches in the video, you try it on yours. Amazing it works. Sit back, relax and rewind or pause if you want to. You will watch it over & over and will likely being sharing with your friends. Enjoy.",974678400,9,571,4.2
