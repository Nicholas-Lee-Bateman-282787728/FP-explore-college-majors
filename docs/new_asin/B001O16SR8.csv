3725709,5,B001O16SR8,Wanted to have my own copy so that I can use it for future reference- I can retain it better after watching the DVD,1361923200,,115,3.8333333333333335
3725710,5,B001O16SR8,I had this video and lost it somewhere so i had to order it again. I am a medical professional and fell in love with the exibit when it came to my local area.,1337299200,,158,3.676470588235294
3725711,5,B001O16SR8,"In this DVD, Dr. Gunther von Hagens and Prof. John A. Lee show the four functions of human body. The functions are  movement, circulation, digestion and reproduction. The cadavers have gone through the preserving process called ""plastination"". According to its inventor, Dr. Gunther von Hagens, plastination is "" The process of extracting all bodily fluids and soluble fat from specimens, replacing them through vacuum forced impregnation with reactive resins and elastomers, and then curing them with light, heat, or certain gases, which give the specimens rigidity and permanence"".

The video is sharp, colorful and detailed. It's unique. Nobody has ever done this before. It's a must for anybody who is learning anatomy. It tremendously satisfies my curiosity.

The only downside is there is no subtitle. That's an obstacle for non-biology viewers because you don't know the scientific terms beings used by the doctors. Dr. Gunther's accent also makes it a little difficult to understand sometimes.

This DVD is one of the 3 sets of DVDs in the same series. The others are Bodyworlds and Autopsy Life and Death. I own copies of them all. You can visit Dr. Gunther's page at bodyworlds dot com.",1324166400,9,1196,5.149484536082475

3725713,5,B001O16SR8,I watched the GI Tract portion in my college Nutrition class. Our professor is an MD and feels this is one of the best anatomy videos he has seen. I have to agree. Very interesting video.,1318291200,,187,4.222222222222222
3725714,5,B001O16SR8,"Excellent resource for college A&P classes.  I also recommend Autopsy of Life and Death (by the same institution) Many colleges do not have cadaver labs, particularly at the communtiy level.  These videos provide a highly informative alternative to the wet lab experience.  They are also very reasonable in price. If you get the chance to veiw one of the Body Worlds Exhibits I would highly recommend it.  It is an emotional experience to say the least.",1299801600,9,453,4.921052631578948
3725715,5,B001O16SR8,Wow!  Terrific!  Amazing!  Should be required viewing for any student of anatomy--at the college or medical school level.  Well done.,1291161600,5,133,5.5
3725716,5,B001O16SR8,"Program really brings anatomy and physiology to life.  Has made a huge difference in my personal understanding, as well as my ability to translate the language of anatomy for my students.",1274572800,5,187,5.032258064516129
3725717,4,B001O16SR8,"The lack of detail was disappointing, but I believe the public presentation was performed well and professionally.  For the price, they should have more interactive options and more plastinate examples.",1258588800,6,202,5.733333333333333
8328740,5,B001O16SR8,Absolutely entertaining way to introduce anatomy to students.,1445904000,,61,6.75
8328741,5,B001O16SR8,Helps in my medical classes I teach,1437868800,,35,4.142857142857143
8328742,5,B001O16SR8,I teach high school anatomy. This video series is awesome. I show a specific video when I am teaching the corresponding unit. FYI: they use nude modes so be prepared for that.  It will help if you have upperclassmen. Younger students may not be mature enough to handle the nude models.,1436572800,,285,4.588235294117647
8328743,5,B001O16SR8,Absolutely the best. I use it in my anatomy and physiology classes.,1430524800,,67,4.666666666666667
8328744,5,B001O16SR8,"I bought this video set to supplement my teaching. I teach high school a Anatomy and Physiology. It is REALLY amazing! The host comes across a little creepy, but that makes the videos all the more interesting. Definitely recommend. Seriously educational and tasteful.",1430265600,,267,5.232558139534884
8328745,5,B001O16SR8,"I am a biology teacher and show the kids this instead of cutting apart an animal.  The accent is a bit difficult to understand for some students, but it is fabulous.",1428710400,,165,4.32258064516129
8328746,5,B001O16SR8,really good for learning the human body,1418428800,,39,4.714285714285714
8328747,5,B001O16SR8,My daughter wants to be a medical examiner and she LOVED this video.  Wow!  It was really well done and very informative.  There are live nude male and female models that artist paint on to show you where all the insides are while the Autopsy is going on.,1413244800,,255,4.270833333333333
8328748,5,B001O16SR8,"This lecture series gives an amazing and thorough view of the major components of the body. My friends and I use this all the time to study for tests and identifying systems/ parts of the body. Granted it is not for the casual viewer, for it has some aspects that are hard to watch, but if anyone wants to learn about the body the this is a great lecture series for it. Very easy to understand what is going on and constant details to further the experience, like real world applications and live models to show what they are talking about. WARNING: This is a full dissection of human cadavers! No blood but still graphic. Also the live models are fully nude, just so no one thinks to show this in a preteen or younger class.",1393804800,,725,4.338235294117647
8328749,5,B001O16SR8,"Bought this for my Anatomy & Physiology students and everyone LOVED it....well 3 of the 4 parts any way. they used a plastinated cadaver for one part and it just wasn't as cool, still worth the money though. First section is by far the best, the doctors remove the whole integumentary system (skin) in one piece and hang it up....looks like footie-pajama's! Awesome! Very in depth and educations;.",1374364800,,397,4.852941176470588
