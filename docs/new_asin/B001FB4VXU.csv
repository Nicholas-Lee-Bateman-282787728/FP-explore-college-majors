3567942,5,B001FB4VXU,"I think this sitcom belongs up there with the all time greats- I love Lucy, All in the Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, (insert your favorite classic sitcom here).  I purchased the first season, and can't wait for the second to become available.  Sheldon is just so ""out there"".  I love the whole cast.",1233187200,48,302,4.660377358490566
3567943,5,B001FB4VXU,"Our favorite sitcom continues to develope its characters, and there's plenty left.  I disagree utterly with the previous reveiwer.  I think his high school angst is blinding him to the obvious.  Sorry I can't give the series 6 stars.",1232668800,24,233,4.923076923076923
3567944,3,B001FB4VXU,Series One was superb. This one is concentrating far too much on Leonard's love life. The whole thing is becoming less of an ensemble piece and more of a duet between Sheldon and Leonard. It is also moving towards high school angst instead of making more of the general nerdishness (and Howard's mother!),1232236800,10,304,4.754716981132075

His minute reactions both facially and bodily are amazing. If you've ever known anyone on the spectrum, you know that Jim Parsons has studied this situation carefully.

3569119,5,B001FB4VXU,"This is truly a great comedy. There is something in this that everyone can relate to. Mostly the inner child who grew up a nerd/geek etc. But, there is more to it than just nerds hanging out facing life's problems. There is an introspective into what our lives were as children and who we might have been or who we are. This is the show that says it's OK to be 30 and living with mom, it's OK to be 30 and still have difficulty finding the right girlfriend. Basically, this show says it's OK not to fit in, or be part of what society calls the norm. This show takes social awkwardness and makes you laugh but while making you understand what it's like. The writers must have experienced some of it themselves or at least studied it. TBBT also gives us Sheldon a brilliant scientist who is more robot than human and lets the audience grow with him as he becomes more human little by little. It's a great show, I suggest you buy all 10 seasons when they are available.

3570436,5,B001FB4VXU,"It's official.  I am truly addicted to The Big Bang Theory.  And after several years without a sitcom on my weekly TV schedule, I am thrilled.  I recently caught up with the second season on DVD, and now that I've stopped laughing, I'll share my thoughts with you.

The show revolves around four physicists.  Leonard and Sheldon (Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons) are roommates.  They are good friends with Howard (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) since all four work at Cal Poly.  Across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon's apartment lives Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a want to be actress who pays her bills as a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.  In any other world, she'd be the normal one of the group, but as Sheldon points out at one point, ""In this room, you are the one who is peculiar.""

The season opens exactly where season 1 left off.  Leonard has finally acted on his crush and asked Penny out.  But she quickly dumps him and then confides the reason to Sheldon who almost moves out instead of keep the secret.  Over the course of the season, Penny becomes addicted to an on-line roll playing game, Raj gets a big head after landing in ""People"" magazine, everyone tries to teach Sheldon how to drive, Penny and Sheldon wind up in a feud but they batch things up in time for Penny to give Sheldon the best Christmas present ever, Howard actually gets a girlfriend (temporarily), and Penny accidently hits Sheldon's couch cushion with paintballs.

Most of the focus on this show is on Sheldon, whose neurotic behavior is perfectly played by Jim Parsons.  And there's a very good reason for that.  Sheldon often gets the funniest lines or funniest stories, and Jim's acting is absolutely perfect.  I really do feel that this character in anyone else's hands would be a disaster.

But that's not to knock the rest of the cast.  All five of the leads are great comedians and brings their characters to full life with every episode.  Kunal Nayyar has a hard job since his character is too shy to talk around women, but he still manages to get some great laughs out of us.  When Howard isn't being a slimeball, he can be funny.  And Leonard really is the most normal of the guys, and the one I identify with the most.

Which leaves us with Penny.  She is the emotional heart of the show.  While often frustrated with the guys and their lack of social skills, she also usually is quick to forgive and do something that will make you smile.  Take for example the episode where she loses it with Howard for his suggestive comments.  Honestly, I get that since I often find his remarks over the line.  But their scenes together later in that episode are heartwarming.

Of course, there are the funny side bars in each episode, like the one where Sheldon expands the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors by adding Lizard and Spock.  He does it to decrease the odds of ties, a plan that backfires in some of my favorite moments in the season.

Season two consisted of 23 episodes, which are preserved here on 4 discs.  The fourth disc also gives us an interview with the real life physicist who helps with the show's incredible amount of science as well as interviews with the actors and creators about how the show progressed in season two.  Finally, there's a great gag reel.

This show never fails to make me laugh.  If you are looking for a great sitcom, look no further than season two of The Big Bang Theory.",1431907200,,3403,4.551894563426688

3570511,4,B001FB4VXU,"Big Bang Theory is one of those series that actually gets better the longer it's on. The seventh season is better than the first. After season one, each season gets funnier and funnier. I thin the actors were just getting into their groove and figuring out who their characters were. So this season, being an earlier one, isn't my favorite....Howard is still a little gross. I end up really liking Howard later on, but in the early seasons he's kind of a pig. Anyway, all seasons of Big Bang Theory are still better and more funny than most shows out there, so totally buy this one if you like the show. It's worth it!",1430352000,,618,4.4298245614035086

3570546,5,B001FB4VXU,"More of the same from the people that bring you Big Bang Theory...the most funniest sitcom I've really enjoyed in awhile. The characters are magical and you can relate to with all their nerdy quirks and situations they seem to get themselves in.  Jim Parsons does an excellent job as Sheldon and if I knew a person similar to the ""Sheldon"" character...I would seriously believe in ET's! {LOL} All the actors in this sitcom do an excellent job, but I think they really have to give a lot of credit to the creators and writer's of the show!  Good writing can make it easier for a show to become a hit--along with the acting!  Check it out!",1429574400,,637,4.427350427350428

3570777,5,B001FB4VXU,"We have never been fans of sitcoms. This was recommended to us by a friend and to appease her, we watched an episode a couple years ago. After that, we became hooked and looked forward to watching it each night since several episodes run back-to-back each evening. We decided that we needed to own each of the seasons as they came out so we could see them in their intended order. The individual characters are lovable in their own way and I love the fact that they included a character with selective mutism. Our favorites are Sheldon and Bernadette (she is introduced in a later season), though the series would not be the same if any one of them was phased out of the series. The storyline continues to develop nicely and it hasn't reached the point of becoming stale any time soon. The series is geared toward a mature audience. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well-developed group of quirky characters.",1421539200,,922,4.593939393939394

3571195,5,B001FB4VXU,"In all honesty, I think the only show that's been better than this in relatively recent history, is The Sopranos.
It's so consistent, and the relationships are scripted and presented so well....I actually laugh out loud STILL
while watching the younger seasons.  It's truly good TV watching and one of the few things I miss after
having cut the cable.  Having dozens of these on DVR was awesome, but now I'll own them all on disc.
Five Stars for every season.  If you see ratings that are 3 stars or less, just read them for the humor, because
that's actually insane.",1410393600,,567,4.594059405940594

But I can relate to the geekiness of began fanatical of games and certain sci-fi or fantasy franchises.  I can relate to Howard who still lives at home in this season, and I sometimes relate to Sheldon's schizoid, apathetic behavior, but he's also a jerk.  haha.  I'm not too big on the newer seasons, because I've outgrown this phase, and Sheldon getting a girlriend seems somewhat out of character.",1406505600,,562,4.742268041237113

Now in it's eights season with more to come, I can't wait for each new episode.  The characters have developed over the years and have become 'our friends'.  We cheer for their successes and weep for their failures.  If you're not already a fan, start watching this hilariously funny show.  You soon will be.",1404000000,,412,4.44

3571371,5,B001FB4VXU,"Cannot say anything bad about this show.  Love all the actors.  Jim Parsons is the best.  Great to have the series and if one is feeling low, then watch The Big Bang  and it will get you out of your slump.  Plan to purchase the remaining seasons.",1402963200,,246,4.148936170212766
3571432,5,B001FB4VXU,"I liked the earlier episodes of this series.  Sadly they are dumbing it down a bit to appeal to the masses.  My son wanted to watch this show when it first started and I happened to catch the episodes when they came on.  The earlier episodes were about relationships and four guys who were out of touch and discovering the world around them, and meshing their world with the real one.  The Physics problems on the white board are actual Physics problems and I found it great how the writers were able to subtly work theories into the episodes.  To me, and this is only me, it is sad they have moved away from the original premise of the show into more of just another TV series; the early episodes were something different from the standard sitcom formula.  If you haven't seen the earlier episodes they are well worth the time.",1402790400,,828,4.450331125827814

3571434,5,B001FB4VXU,"I recently started watching this show with my husband. I admit we were both hesitant at first and really only started watching it out of sheer desperation since everything is on hiatus for the summer. But omg, talk about a revelation!! This is seriously one of the funniest sitcoms EVER and certainly the funniest in a long time. Personally, I was especially pleased about the reprisal of the awkward relationship between Johnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert (aka David Healy and Darlene Connor in Roseanne) - and Sara Gilbert delivered her typical derisive snarkiness with aplomb, especially opposite Jim Parsons.

All the characters are so hilarious and the situations so embarrassing, groan-worthy and snort-inducing that I can't imagine anyone NOT finding this show funny!! On a personal note, I also greatly appreciate the notable absence of constant vulgarity and profanity so common with tv shows these days.

Give this show a chance, even if you think it's not your style - you might be surprised!",1402272000,,1000,5.091463414634147

Ofcourse everyone knows by know that this is a wonderful show for all types of people but I am a network engineer so I emphasisize how technical people, nerds, programmers, physics and chemistry lovers will bond with this optimistic, and happy show. All sitcoms sort of recycle the same scenarios that the characters experience but its funny how when math and science are added, the show can avoid being clich through them.",1400716800,,471,5.051282051282051

Since we don't have TV (well, we are still waiting for our old analog TV to break before we spring for a flat-panel), we watch TV online and buy our favorite shows so we can watch again and again.

 A great cast; a memorable cast; a cast that slowly increased in size as more & more quality cast members and quality characters were added. The original idea has grown in good ways.

How is it possible with all we know about the horrific cruelty and animal suffering that takes place in science labs using animals, that anyone (and there are several writers, producers etc, not to mention the actors who agree to say these lines) could write a show and consistently make jokes about it!? I think everyone involved should be required to visit some real labs where they poison these poor creatures and fill them with mind altering drugs and chemicals for their entire lives, until they can't take any more and die. Then imagine their beloved dog or cat in that heartbreaking situation, and see if they still think it's funny!! I've completely lost respect for everyone involved in this show, so of course will not be watching it, but for their sake and for the sake of all those they influence, I hope their writing becomes imbued with more consciousness and compassion in the future.

3571714,5,B001FB4VXU,"THE BIG BANG THEORY was a failed pilot until creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady re-wrote the script to take advantage of the chemistry between lead actors Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki.  The series went on the air in 2007 and quickly became a national favorite.  Most comedies traffic in stereotypes and this series is no different, centering on a group of socially inept geniuses who run afoul of the pretty but intellectually average girl who lives across the hall--but the fun of the series is in the way it undercuts the stereotypes, giving us glimpses of humor and humanity in unexpected and often laugh-out-loud ways.

The characters have evolved from the first season; superbrain Sheldon (Jim Parsons) is shorn of his offensive edge, his roommate Leonard (Johnny Galecki) is more assertive, and next-door-neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco) has the gift of common sense that her high I.Q. friends often lack.  The supporting characters Howard (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) are expanded and become increasingly important to the series.  The story arc continues with Leonard's affection for Penny--and she does not return it he falls into a relationship with fellow physicist Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert) and then with Dr. Stephanie Barnett (Sara Rue.)  Leonard also receives a greatly unwanted visit from his icy mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski.)  My own favorite episode in the second season is ""The Panty Piata Polarization,"" a wickedly funny show in which Penny and Sheldon become locked in a game of one-upmanship that involves everything from washing machines to panties hanging on a telephone line.

I'm not a particular fan of network television and I rarely pay attention to the sit-coms that blanket that arena, but THE BIG BANG THEORY is one of the very few series that can make me laugh out loud. Strongly recommended.

I bought the season 1-5 set a few years back and just had to re-buy this season because the first disc degraded to the point that it became un-watchable.  And no, I didn't scratch the disc or anything.  I put it in the player and got most of the way through before it froze up (I'd watched the disc a few times before, so I know it at least used to play all the way through).  I ejected the disc to see if it needed cleaning and found a 1/4 inch long strip where it looked like the data layer had been scratched, but there was no physical scratch on either side of the disc.  I realized that there was nothing I could do about that, so I put it back in to see if I could get through the rest of the episode, and it played even worse. I went back and tried to play the rest of the disc, and another episode I had just watched was now unplayable.  So obviously the disc was getting worse.

3571832,4,B001FB4VXU,"this series is very clever, you can't help but be annoyed by Sheldon at first then you realize that he is the ultimate ""fish out of water"" story - he is sooooo socially inept that you start to feel a little sorry for him. Leonard is still striving for acceptance (whereas Sheldon pretends not to care) and balances life with his odd roommate with his desire to be more ""mainstream"". Raj seems to take everything in stride including his inability to even speak to women and Howard over-compensates for his lack of charm with his faux confidence. Throw in Penny, the hot blond, into the mix and you have a recipe for either disaster or lunacy, with the later winning out.
A fun show that has good writing and some clever puns (even mathematical ones on the various white boards on set - if you understand some advanced math you will get some of the more subtle equation puns).",1388275200,,874,4.50314465408805

There are some very memorable episodes this season, particularly the one where Penny's competition moves in in the form of a new blonde neighbor, it was the first episode I felt they gave Penny the absolute best lines in.

It is nothing short of brilliant, and each season not only delivers, but gets better and better - if that is possible!  Even the peripheral characters are amazing - Laurie Metcalf gives an absolutely hysterical performance as Sheldon's Bible-thumping Mama, whereas Christien Baranski is superb as the ever-cold, ever-frigid mother of Lenonard.  And who can forget Mrs. Walowitz - who can be heard constantly yelling uncouth remarks at poor Howard, while we get to see Raj visit with his parents who are most concerned about him finding a nice Indian Girl.

3572176,4,B001FB4VXU,"After a first season that was good overall but also a little inconsistent, the second season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" is an improvement over the first one. Here, the writing is significantly sharper. The plots are also less outlandish (which is good for a sitcom about theoretical physicists), and the characterization is stronger (especially for Sheldon).

While season one had occasional great episodes in a bunch of episodes that were mostly just good, this season is more consistent in terms of quality. Interestingly, the episodes with the most unfunny-sounding plots ended up being the best ones. ""The Terminator Decoupling"" is a great example of this. It takes place almost entirely on a train, and has only one real plot. It's a standout episode of the entire series, mainly for its smart writing and unique structure. Another one is ""The Monopolar Expedition,"" in which the physicists go to the Arctic and find the place they're staying at to be strangely familiar. Included in this one are also some fan favorites: ""The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,"" named by TV Guide as the 60th best television show episode of all time, even though there are better ones in my opinion. ""The Euclid Alternative,"" with everybody's attempts to get Sheldon to learn how to drive.

This DVD set has a little more than season one when it comes to DVD extras. At least there's a gag reel (which pretty much every DVD set should have, come on), although some fans may be a little irritated that the cuss words in it are censored.

Best episodes: ""The Lizard-Spock Expansion"" and ""The Terminator Decoupling""

3572207,5,B001FB4VXU,"In The Panty Pi&ntilde;ata Polarization episode of Season Two of The Big Bang Theory, Penny, the attractive female from across the hall comes into Sheldon and Leonard's apartment interrupting a Klingon Boggle game they are playing with Howard and Raj.  Her cable out she grabs the remote to turn on America's Top Model. The scene shows Penny comfortable enough to come into the lives of these four as she pleases while engaging in knowing banter. ""Did you pay your cable bill?"" Howard asks. ""You sound just like the phone company,"" Penny replies. But as soon as the channel is changed Howard becomes immediately aroused verbally pointing out future wife's, while Raj and Leonard quietly gawk in the background leaving only Sheldon to play the game. Penny leaves the room as she becomes immediately aware of the aroused trio sitting around her.  It's clear these scientists didn't even know America's Top Model existed.

In Season One of The Big Bang Theory the storyline revolved around two unique worlds coming together.  It was a great start to the series but left the writers with one question:  what happens after the collision?  In Season Two, The Big Bang Theory takes great pleasure in exploring the awkward new dynamic.

Instead of falling into the trap of putting two appealing characters in a romantic relationship too soon (hello The Office) Season Two of The Big Bang Theory mines the comedic gold of holding back. While the season begins with Penny and Leonard on a date, it becomes painfully obvious these two just aren't capable of maintaining a romantic connection. And it turns out the fight to sustain a connection to each others' worlds is where the humor of The Big Bang Theory resides.

No more is this apparent than when Penny asks Sheldon in the The Bad Fish Paradigm if Leonard had ever dated any ""normal"" girls (you know, ones who aren't geniuses). It starts the season on a high note making the viewer realize that Penny is just as in awe of the boys as the boys are in awe of her.  She is getting something from these geniuses. Sheldon's response highlights how Penny's expectation of Sheldon as her friend, something he wasn't even aware he was until this episode, puts the most proudly anti-social of the geeks into a situation he has no skill or experience in dealing with, keeping a secret.

The shows best moments come when Penny and the boys squirm through their new dynamic trying to figure out how to deal with this unexpected element.  Watch The Griffin Equivalency where Raj invites Penny to a People magazine party only to get drunk and become a huge jerk in the process. It is painfully, and hilariously apparent Raj just doesn't know what to do with a pretty girl. On the flip side is The Barbarian Sublimation where Penny is introduced to the online game Age of Conan by Sheldon and becomes a complete gaming addict leading Sheldon to say that girl needs to get a life. It shows it is not just the boys who are thrown for a loop by Penny. But Penny is also trying to deal with being attracted to a geek culture she has no grasp of.

When worlds collide there's an aftermath, for The Big Bang Theory this aftermath was a solid step forward in the evolution of the characters and their relationships. As figuring out how to deal with the new and unexpected can be just as funny as the new and unexpected.",1374019200,,3343,4.666666666666667

3572229,1,B001FB4VXU,"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes ""come out of the charecters."" I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how ""geeky"" they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.",1371945600,6,1468,4.303249097472924

I could live without ""Home Improvement"" reruns but NOT without my Sheldon-Leonard fix. For, when it comes to the most ""Bang"" for my buck, those two characters are undeniably the heart and soul of this excellent series, which remains strong and must-seeable into its second season. Johnny Galecki's and Jim Parsons' characters -- so similar and yet lightyears apart -- clearly rule the show, ably aided by sidekicks Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) and Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), although the latter's over-the-topness can sometimes land with a thud. Sadly, Kaley Cuoco as Penny has not sizzled up her acting chops one iota since Season One and remains the weakest link of the show. I realize that the show's male fans are too busy paying attention to her physical attributes to have noticed that the girl simply can't act but those of us whose attentions are focused above her neck are cringing our way through her many scenes. Happily, Galecki and Parsons are powerful enough to keep Cuoco from pulling the show into a black hole of failure and, just when I'm wishing for a strong female actress to add comic estrogen to the mix, along comes the uber-talented Sara Gilbert as Dr. Leslie Winkle to save the day (when she's given more to do by the writers than throw one-line insults at Sheldon). In summary, if Cuoco -- who is on screen a LOT -- ever develops acting range beyond two basic facial expressions, this show is going to be the best sitcom in planetary history.

3572359,5,B001FB4VXU,"At the recommendation of some friends I checked out Big Bang Theory season 1 and found it to be funny but not amazing.  Season 2 really takes the show to a new level though.  The characters have been established, the in-jokes have been set, and now the writers really start cranking out some great episodes.  I highly recommend giving this series a shot.  The first season is funny on it's own, but it really gets better the more episodes you watch.  Great show all around.",1367280000,,473,4.517647058823529

3572392,5,B001FB4VXU,"My teenage daughter got us hooked on this series.  We started at the pilot episode (via steaming) and worked our way through all the season.  When we finished, we started back at the beginning and watching them all again.  She is getting ready to head off to college in the fall and wants to be able to watch these in her dorm room, so we have purchased all seasons on DVD to pack.

This is a series that is funny the first time and every bit as funny the second time.  There are some elements/great lines that we didn't fully appreciate until a second viewing and the episodes still feel fresh.

I will say to parents considering this series for their kids:  the series is filled with talk about sex and that is the primary motivator for many of the characters.  Not a problem for the older teen, but I wouldn't have felt comfortable with the subject matter when my daughter was a younger teen.  It is pretty constant and very obvious - not much is subtle.  Just be aware and you may want to watch a couple of episodes for yourself before making a decision.",1365811200,2,1058,4.3520408163265305

3572485,5,B001FB4VXU,"Okay, I'm a bit of a nerd so suppose that slightly predisposes me to liking a comedy show starring the types of people I can relate to. But the bottom line is that this is THE funnest television series I have ever seen in my life. For the first time in my life, most of which has been spent behind a book or computer rather than a t.v. set, I find myself looking forward to watching another episode, and even THINKING about one that I have seen makes me laugh out loud. As much as I have enjoyed The Simpsons, Married With Children, and even South Park, no other series has held my attention or made me laugh as hard or as often as this show has done so far. I MUST own all seasons. This is pure medicine for the laugh muscles.
  The initial premise is simple enough - a couple of super-smart guys (Leonard & Sheldon) share an apartment. With near-zero social skills with the opposite sex, they meet their sexy but not as smart neighbor, Penny. Add a couple of friendly sex-starved nerds with similar skill sets and hilarity reliably ensues. I noticed someone criticized the show for adding many characters as the seasons went on, ""losing"" the initial premise. I disagree. Unlike a cartoon where the characters remain pretty much the same age as when the series began, these people are moving on with their lives, growing in all ways as the audience witnesses their growing pains with sympathy and laughter. It gets better every season. I am addicted and love it.
And for the first time in my life, I have a desire to meet and talk with the writers of this show. THAT is how impressed I am with these guys. The writers are BRILLIANT, and a fantastic cast brings their words to life perfectly. I cannot think of one thing I do NOT like about this show! TRY it. You can see a few episodes from Season 6 for free on CBS. Then, like me, you'll probably want to see every season asap. Enjoy. Have tissues handy for the tears of laughter.",1361318400,,1932,4.378830083565459

Something I'm frustrated about, and am not willing to spend an outrageous amount to have fixed, its to small of an issue to be fixed. This is something minor, but I keep good care of my DVD's so the fact that how they were handled in the mail means that they are broken in minor areas which is something I couldn't control is something I don't like. I like things to look asethically pleasing so the fact that the plastic casing has come apart, and that the closure of the DVD is broken so it doesn't automatically closes erks me.

I happened to watch one of TBBT shows and became hooked on it. Just be careful the producers allow Shelton to go the way of Dr. House on ""House"" and later shows of that series seemed to concentrate more on House being nasty then anything. The same could easily happen with TBBT.

Once I did, I really can't get enough of this series...and thus, have to order the DVDs!  The story is about 4 geniuses who happen to be nerds, and the stories dealing with their lack of social skills is hilarious.  The series hired a consultant because they do touch on scientific principles, speak English but with BIG WORDS, and other points that would be spoilers if mentioned.  They are based on real people the creators of this series met on the East Coast.

3573193,5,B001FB4VXU,"It is rare in this day and age when a uniquely styled comedy comes out into mainstream tv. This is one of them. Not only does it remain fresh each episode, it is not a show where the common gag or common punchline elicits laughter. The material is smartly written and also fact checked with a resident physicist and/or other expert in the fields they are putting their characters into on a regular basis. This show is a treat to young and old and will forever be a favorite of many, many  people. Now, having said all of that, be aware that if you choose to take the Sheldon approach to knocking on your boss's door, make sure he either knows about the show or watched it. Otherwise, you will get the Penny treatment. 'Nuff said. :-)",1351123200,,733,4.350364963503649

3573198,5,B001FB4VXU,Often I cannot access the video library. Amazon needs to work on this. The characters all balance each other out and the story writing is excellent.,1349481600,,148,4.730769230769231

3573202,5,B001FB4VXU,But this is one of the funnier episodes. Big Bang Theory is a great show for those twiners who are old and mature enough more than Nick at Nite.,1346889600,,144,4.0
3573243,5,B001FB4VXU,I watched every episode of this season and it was well worth the wait.  Even the gag reel was worth it.,1346284800,,103,3.9047619047619047
3573244,5,B001FB4VXU,Honestly I can't believe I hadn't been watching this all along. This summer I've gotten and watched all four seasons that have been released and its a great show. I find its one of those shows like Friends or Seinfeld that you constantly in real life can make references to something that had happened in the show. Definitely recommend it.,1346112000,,339,4.666666666666667
3573245,5,B001FB4VXU,"Since the product was used, I expected a small fault or two... but the packaging and all its contents were in exceptional condition! It's hard to believe this DVD set was even used! Will definitely be looking at more of this seller's products in the future!",1344988800,,257,4.608695652173913
3573246,5,B001FB4VXU,"What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 262 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.

It also took me a while since I started with ""Complete FIRST Season"" and just now finishing the second one.

Though the Complete Second  Season has been released before, a new ""Combo Pack"" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again!). The gag reel and the two featurettes from the previous release are here with nothing added.

For those who asked - in reference to my review of the ""First Season"" volume, these are all single-sided discs; not double sided.

There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after watching the episodes in the first season (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters in Season Two are actually becoming more interesting. And they were very interesting in the previous season. . Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy.

The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer in Season One, and though it hasn't changed in Season Two  - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a ""laugh track"" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot earlier but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt the need to use these. I've been told that there were live audiences there, however the creators feel it necessary to augment the live laughs with pre-recorded ones. But, the lines are so funny that I'm now fairly content <g>.

So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of ""catching up"". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and, like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!

I'm guessing that the ""Complete Third Season"" will be released soon in a combo-pack as well.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

3573324,5,B001FB4VXU,"Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.

Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills. His roommate, Leonard, is a run-of-the-mill genius by comparison; also brilliant, but self-aware enough to know there is more to life than physics research. Their social group is rounded out by Raj, another physicist who is to shy to talk when women are present (unless he has had a few drinks) and Howard, the mere engineer of the group. These four friends are fairly content to watch science fiction films, collect action figures, and chase girls unsuccessfully . . . until they meet the girl next door (literally), Penny, the aspiring actress and ""dumb blonde"" who can teach these four brilliant scientists a thing or two about enjoying life.

The characters are all likeable and relatable in their own ways and mostly nice to one another.

You might think these characters are over the top, but I have met enough geeks to know that people like this really do exist . . . and really are entertaining.

Fun for the whole family; we haven't yet seen an episode that didn't make us laugh out loud!",1340582400,,1146,4.802030456852792

Howard is so...crazy, hilaious, and a horny little man with ""Balls"".  He comes up with outrageous ideas to meet women. Howard and his relationship wih his mother is also funny.

We left off season one with Leonard and Penny having a date for the first time.  This is picked up immediately in the next episode and then falls at the wayside.  The progression of Leonard chasing Penny continues throughout this season as Penny becomes more and more indoctrinated into the realm of geek and finds herself strangely at ease with the three men that now people her life.

The show progresses smoothly, depends on older comedy without become dependent, while substituting new comedic representations that make for a fantastic set of episodes.  Now that the characters are set in their ways and we have gotten used to them, I would even go so far to say that this season is funnier than the first.

3573489,5,B001FB4VXU,"There are several subplots in this episode, all of which are overshadowed by Sheldon's, which is now generally considered the funniest Big Bang Theory moment of the entire run of the show.

Sheldon struggles to find an appropriate Christmas gift for Penny. He is angry at Penny because she bought him a Christmas gift. Sheldon now feels he has to reciprocate and go through the trouble of buying something for someone he doesn't really understand, all at the same price of the gift he is about to receive.

Sheldon's gift-giving search does not go well. He can't seem to find anything a woman would want in a bath & body shop. Even though they have lotions, bath oils, and soaps, Sheldon sees it as a ""cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon, and vanilla."" Howard picks a gift basket to purchase, but Sheldon stops him. He has no knowledge of what size gift basket to get.

Back at the apartment, Raj enters with 3 huge gift baskets, Howard with 2, and Sheldon with a tiny basket. Sheldon's plan is to open Penny's gift to him first, then excuse himself with some ""gastric trouble,"" and get the appropriately-priced basket, returning the others later.

It's now time for the moment of truth: the exchange of gifts. Sheldon fears what basket he has to give her, but he calms down when he sees Penny only got him a napkin. It seems to be a very mundane gift, until he turns it over and reads, ""To Sheldon, Live Long and Prosper. Leonard Nimoy.""

Sheldon is completely, totally, and UTTERLY speechless. Penny got Leonard Nimoy to sign a napkin for him! She apologizes that the napkin is a little dirty because ""Leonard wiped his mouth on it,"" but Sheldon practically crys for joy as he shouts, ""DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS! ALL I NEED IS A HEALTHY OVUM, AND I CAN GROW MY OWN LEONARD NIMOY!!""

Sheldon goes to get his gift for Penny. He returns with the bath baskets. ALL OF THEM. She's overwhelmed, but he STILL thinks it isn't enough. He goes for broke....AND GIVES PENNY A HUG!

Then at the final moment, Leonard smiles and says, ""It's a Saturnalia miracle!!""",1322784000,3,2076,4.625

3573491,5,B001FB4VXU,"Another Great Season of The Big Bang Theory fun to have at home on DVD to satisfy each Big Bang Whim.

(See my Season One review for a recap of the show premise and main characters.) The comedic goodness continues with The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season. However, as was my frustration with The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season, the Second Season DVD still doesn't provide enough extras to make me want to buy more. Cast interviews, commentaries, reflections from the designers, are the meat and potatoes for me in regard to stellar DVD features. I want to hear more about the process of making this world come to life...but I want to be entertained while you tell me.  Big order, I know.  Yet none of these grumblings about the weak extras on the DVD can dampens my enthusiasm for this excellent 23-minute escapade of laughter. And so, this season's DVD retains a 5-star rating with the hope that in subsequent seasons, the DVD supplementals will continue to improve.

Also as with the Season One DVD, you still can and should, pause for the Chuck Lorre's Vanity Card to enjoy his weekly offering of wit and life observations.  It's the cherry on top.

From my Season One Review:
I avoided the Big Bang Theory until this year. I'm not sure why. I hadn't heard a lot of talk of it among my friends and family, nor did the seemingly endless promotions seem to ping at my radar.  Yet suddenly, there it was, leading into my other ""late to the party"" favorite, How I Met Your Mother.  I wish I could say I'm not a strong t.v watcher, yet as I think back to the number of sitcoms and ensemble dramas I've viewed through the years, it appears I've dedicated more of my time to the box with moving pictures than was perhaps necessary.  All to say, even with regular press, a successfully completed five seasons, and a fantastic cast of mostly well seasoned actors, I remained painfully oblivious to this quality gem...and my life was emptier for it...

The General Premise of The Big Bang Theory: Two bonafide geniuses with varying degrees of, but undeniable, social awkwardness, live across the hall from a young, beautiful any-woman, who is kind enough to gently show them a world outside of their scientific bubble and geek-topolis, yet also powerful enough to guard them from any less tolerant ""cool kids"".

The dialogue is ripe with geek culture references and scientific humor. Both fully immersed self-identifying brainiacs, nerds, and geeks, as well as ""haven't touched a book since high school and hated it even then"" types, can relax and enjoy the awkward hiccups that our four scientists experience as they try to marry their love for things ""out of this world"" with the realities back ""here on earth"".  The series regularly partners our bumbling scientists with the girl across the hall for typical neighborly conundrums (free loading wifi and ordering thai food) and less typical neighborly activities (driving to San Diego to demand back from a bully ""unimportant things only useful in an imaginary world"").

Kaley Cuoco (from Charmed and 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter) gives a genuine performance as Penny, the patient yet worldly girl-next-door, who takes the guys under her wing (and at times, into her bed).  Johnny Galecki (Darleen's boyfriend in Roseanne) is utterly charming and convincing as the lovable Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, who you quickly want to ""get the girl"".  And Jim Parsons (Emmy Winner for this role) plays Dr. Sheldon Cooper, a former child prodigy and current theoretical physicist at CalTech whose strict adherence to his own routine provides fodder for endless conflict and comedy between his friends, family, and general public.  The chemistry and polarity between these three main characters provides the springboard for most of the shows storylines and comedy.",1321228800,,3834,4.8844375963020035

3573771,5,B001FB4VXU,"`Big Bang Theory Series 2' carries on where series 1 left off, with many hilarious geek jokes and great performances from this comedy cast. This has all the episodes from the series across four discs, as well as extras including a bloopers reel and a short documentary. The various episodes are as humorous as the first series and my personal favourite has to be the one where Leonard's mother comes to visit; to see her interaction with Sheldon is nothing short of genius and makes for twenty minutes of exquisite TV. Wolowitz is as funny as ever trying to find love (be it in it's physical or relationship form) and the lines he comes out with will make you both burst out laughing and cringe. Penny and Sheldon's relationship develops as well and the episode where they buy Christmas presents for each other is especially good and touching. You also get the tension between Penny and Leonard and whilst their love never quite blossoms, they do develop a deeper friendship over the series. I still maintain that Sheldon is the funniest character but to be honest they all manage to raise a laugh at regular intervals. The series finale is especially good and I can't wait to see how it will pick up in series 3, fingers crossed it comes this way soon! All in all if you liked the first series then it is a safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It manages to maintain the high standards it set out for itself and continues to make geek chic the thing to aspire to. Well worth a viewing.

Review of show itself - As you can see, this is one of those Series that BIL considers his own.  Watching faithfully, and becoming addicted via watching over and over (however, therea are worse addictions ;-).  This series continues the story lines from the previous series, with more character development in each episode.

""Its a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" takes on a whole new meaning with our four favorite nerds.  And is especially appealing to sci-fi fans (yes, BIL is also addicted to Battlestar Gallactica).  Of Course, this ever present principle will explain MOST of the basic physics concepts you will ever need: ""Rock, Scissors, Paper, Lizard, Spock.""

Enjoy again, whether you equate yourself as a nerd or not. 5 Stars from the BIL.

3573865,5,B001FB4VXU,"THE BIG BANG THEORY is a sitcom about four nerdy colleagues and Penny, the girl-across-the-hall as their lives intersect.

Wonderfully funny, the show is very cleverly written. With dry humor and intelligent (super-intelligent) dialog the brainy boys try to cope with the world and mere common folks. They approach the issues of life (love, sex, friendships, culture) from a zany perspective which keeps the laughs rolling. Sheldon, the smartest of the bunch, is a theoretical physicist with an ironic, dry wit and sweet vulnerability. He is the star of the show and, if he were writing this review, he would agree.

The show is quick-witted and smart, poking fun at everyone, not the least of whom are our four heroes and the adorable Penny. Be careful, it is addictive.",1293062400,,771,4.9689922480620154

Therefore, I'm giving it 4 stars because the last episode of the season wouldn't play for me.

One big plus is that you get the bonus of watching the show without commercials.
Finally, since the shows are only about 20 minutes long, you can watch two episodes in a row usually.

One of my favorites from season 2 featured a train trip with a special guest appearance by an actress who has been in Sci Fi movies and TV that all of the guys (except Sheldon) hit on, it is hilarious.  Overall, this is definitely a 5 star rating.",1278720000,,665,4.354838709677419

While in the first season Penny did not come across very well, this has been improved a lot as we see that is more and more actively interacting with the main characters. Also the secondary characters such as Raj are given more space. All this makes this series quite special despite the quite traditional setting. Every episode a subject is treated and we get to observe the hilarious effects as the two very difefrents worlds collide.

I copied & maintain the 'Friendship Algorithm', using it regularly. Its funny. It works. I don't pass out in high places though.

The Sheldon's in my life are all prepubescent. Teaching Computer Programming to each other & colleagues until they have a need for a script or 'DOS' command. Suddenly they are my friend. Funny the kind of things they offer, thinking I am really interested. Usually I give in, solve the problem, then go back to being largely ignored. Finding later they took credit for solving the problem with no reference to me. I understand, they cannot admit in front of their peers that they actually had to ask an old fogy for assistance.

I grew up with Spock & Kirk. Reviewing the original Star Trek show's, I am now realizing just how much humor was in them. Shatner is very funny. So was Shakespeare, but we have lost so much of the language, & knowledge of the time. I really never understood Hamlet until I saw Mel Gibson play the part so brilliantly.

This program is a real reflection of our time. The true test of genius is not the ability to understand the problem or even solve it. It is the ability to relate it to us who are not so gifted, and do it in a respectful manner, that really gives us a clue. Steven Hawking comes to mind. I also wonder just how much of Jim Parsons is in the character of Sheldon Cooper.

I just wish there were more 'Penny's'.",1263254400,,1561,4.353951890034364

3574530,5,B001FB4VXU,"When a comedy has a good first season it can be chalked up to luck, when it does it twice, it's time to stand up and take notice. TBBT revolves around these four brainy scientists who have lack social skills and common sense to a degree. Rahj can't talk to women, Howard acts like a creep in front of women and Sheldon has to have an analytical answer for everything and is puzzled by anything that cannot be answered by a formula as illustrated in the Friendship Algorithm where he tries to befriend a little girl who likes monkeys not understanding the potential ramifications of such things. Kaley Cuoko plays Penny the nerds window to the outside world, who by season two has grown into a potential romantic interest for Leonard and accepted member of the boys social circle.

Every episode stands out in it's own way, but two shine above the rest... The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis had me rolling on the floor when Penny gives Sheldon a napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy. And I also enjoyed the episode where Leonard's mother visits and within the episode has led Penny and Leonard to get bombed out of their minds and in bed with each other, referred to Raj and Howard as entering into a pseudo homosexual marriage and has formed a rather hilarious relationship with Sheldon.

3574656,5,B001FB4VXU,"In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!

Well into its third season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is consistently brilliant!

Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.
Best moment (a very hard choice to make): shouting at his sister, who was telling people that her brother is a ""rocket scientist"", that she might as well be telling them he is working at the bridge toll-booth!

Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roomate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny.
Best moment: negotiating with Leslie Winkle (a fellow plain-looking but witty physicist and Sheldon's nemesis) their ...annual intercourse session to achieve ""therapeutic sexual release"" .

Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.
Best moment: diverting a military drone from its way to spying on the Russians, only to locate the house where America's Next Top Model is filmed - and be able to drop by and hit on the vulnerable one that gets kicked out that week!

Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.
Best moment: after falling to give his name to Sheldon's beautiful sister, he comes back to get the flier requesting human test subjects for an experimental anti-shyness drug.

Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends - and from her neighbors.
Best moment: filling in a long medical questionnaire with Sheldon at the hospital. ""Headaches?"" ""Well, I'm getting one now!""

The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!

The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?

You must be starving for entertainment that can not only be funny but actually :: gasp :: intelligent and that can follow in its former footsteps closely with continuity.  Well, my friends, there is a solution.  Grab a bowl of popcorn and pop in, (or turn on), The Big Bang Theory!

Jim Parsons stars as Sheldon and Johnny Galecki stars as Leonard, two physicists who live together in an updated version of the Odd Couple.

Sheldon is a neat freak with zero sense of humor who can never tell when someone is being sarcastic and very well may be asexual, since he has never had even a hint of attraction for someone that we have seen.

Leonard is the more down-to-Earth of the two and it is because of Leonard that friends Howard Wolowitz, (Simon Helberg), and Rajesh Koothrappali, (Kunal Nayyar), even bother to come over, since Sheldon is, at most times, almost intolerable, (but somehow quite enjoyable just the same).

Leonard is hopelessly head over heels for his and Sheldon's neighbor, Penny, (Kaley Cuoco), a personification of the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype who works at the Cheesecake Factory and serves as the ""Rachel"" to Leonard's ""Ross"", if this were a Friends scenario. Thankfully, save for one minor hook-up that went nowhere, the sexual tension between them still exists and we are now in season three.

Wolowitz is the lovable sleaze of the group.  He has all the one-liners to try and get all the women he can get into bed with him.  He is also the inferior one of the group, since he is ""only an engineer"", as Sheldon loves to remind him, while the rest of the group have some sort of academic certification.  He also finds the wackiest of clothing combinations and lives with his mother who we never see but only hear her, (reminiscent of Charlie Brown's teacher), and the exchanges between them are hysterical.

Raj has a major problem in that he literally cannot talk to women without the help of alcohol.  If they are in a large group, he is fine, but one-on-one, he literally freezes up.  Hilarity ensues in season 2 when the group are on a train and Summer Glau guest stars.  Raj has a beer to warm himself up to talk to her and Wolowitz is quick to point out that Raj has mistaken the ""beer"" for a non-alcoholic drink.

In keeping with the Roseanne tradition, (Galecki had his start on the show as Darlene's boyfriend), The Big Bang Theory has had guest stars Laurie Metcalf as Sheldon's holy roller mother and Sara Gilbert in the recurring role of Leslie Winkle, the on-again, off-again bed partner for both Wolowitz and Leonard.  Christine Baranski also guest stars as Leonard's mother who immediately hits it off with Sheldon.

The jokes are hysterical, (each episode usually has that one zinger that you'll quote with your friends), the trivia is enthralling and the characters are lovable.  Plus, the commitment to continuity is more impressive than shows previous to this.  Former jokes are revisited further down the line to reinforce previous points and to counter certain actions from occurring in such a way that you'll be saying to yourself, ""well done!""  Plus, the whole group is incredible in terms of acting with the way they regurgitate such long lines of dialogue with no hesitation--truly impressive.

If you would like to check out some wholesome entertainment, then you need look no further than The Big Bang Theory!",1256774400,,3521,4.7947019867549665
3574872,5,B001FB4VXU,"I can't find anyone who doesn't love THE BIG BANG THEORY.  For some, it is a guilty pleasure; for others it is simply the best show on television.  For whatever the reason, this surprise hit show connects with everyone.  And even more amazing, Season 2 is even better than Season 1.

The premise of THE BIG BANG THEORY is still fresh, fun, and ever evolving: two young, genius, nerdy, socially awkward science professors named Sheldon and Leonard share an apartment. Across the hall, in moves Penny - a sweet, beautiful, blond bombshell who waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory.  Sheldon is wonderfully brilliant and ""waaay out there;"" he has no idea how to connect with the rest of the human race.  Leonard, a brilliant, comic book loving, super-hero pj wearing, sci-fi worshiping genius helps guide Sheldon through intricacies of human interaction, while falling in love with Penny.  And Penny keeps them both real, grounded, and somewhere in the vicinity of planet Earth.  As their friendships develop and grow, THE BIG BANG THEORY just gets better and better.

It continues to be a phenomenon how unbelievably funny THE BIG BANG THEORY is. The writing over two seasons is smart, creative, and consistent. Somehow, the characterizations are masterful and avoid being over the top, and each character continues to grow and develop. The acting and comic timing are always inspired. This cohesive ensemble cast continues jell and the relationships deepen, and this talented cast just keeps surpassing all expectation.  There are so few shows that have ever given me a belly laugh in every episode; THE BIG BANG THEORY is definitely a member of the elite group, and is, in fact, leading the pack.  Clearly everyone involved in this effort cares for the show and for each other, and that is what makes THE BIG BANG THEORY work so well.

Several favorite and beloved episodes have come out of THE BIG BANG THEORY's 2nd season, with my personal favorite being the Christmas episode, entitled ""The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis."" In this episode, Penny gives a truly thoughtful gift, without realizing exactly how thoughtful it is.  Another favorite in my family is the ""The Lizard-Spock Expansion,"" where we first learn of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.  There are many other favorites, but these two particularly stand out.

If you haven't seen Big Bang, give it a try. Your sides will ache from laughing so hard. And personally, I still think the theme, sung by Bare Naked Ladies, is the best theme song on television.  It makes my feet do a happy dance every time.",1256688000,,2571,4.97196261682243

3575204,5,B001FB4VXU,"In the second season The Big Bang Theory gains momentum.  The genius exhibited in the first season is expounded as we get to see our favorite characters and situations fleshed out with increasing hilarity.

Leonard's pining for Penny becomes more poignant.  Howard's inappropriate machismo sets up him perfectly for the thrashing he receives from every woman he tries to meet, as well as his hilariously sharp-tongued (but never seen) mother.  Raj tries to assert himself both within the group and apart from his domineering parents, while remaining paralyzed with shyness any time he is around a woman.  Penny's social life is integrated in with the nerds, and in a hilarious turn of events she uses her learned geekiness to protect the guys from a pretty girl who moves into their building and doesn't hesitate to exploit the guys.

Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, is a force of nature.  His geeky understanding of the universe may some day earn him a Nobel Prize, but in the meantime he doesn't have the social aptitude to notice when a gay man hits on him.

The creative brain-trust, led by Chuck Lorre, recognizes that the comedic potential of Parson's Sheldon is far richer than any interest generated by a love-story arc, between Penny or any of the guys.

It was difficult to improve on the essentially perfect first season - but season two is simply funnier.

So, if you are planning to buy it, go ahead, you'll not regret it.

Being part of a test screen audience for the pilot I knew it was going to make a big splash when it officially hit the airwaves. Now it's one of the most watched and now even nominated for an Emmy award.

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to watch any of this second season, so this was a must have purchase for me. The show pretty much picks up right where it leaves you in the first season with all it's nerdy glory. This time a few new things are thrown into the mix such as Penny getting into online gaming, Sheldon apparently picking up women and throwing the great Sara Gilbert into the main cast. Though I will admit while this second season is very much enjoyable I didn't get many belly laughs out of this season as I did the first. It was probably because the first season was an introduction to the routines and the jokes so of course when you see it for the first time you get a much more amped up reaction. Though I will say that the episode where Sheldon has coffee for the first time and pretends he's The Flash is classic!

Still, I am by no means knocking the show because it is still enjoyable the acting is dead on and everybody should see it. I am just hoping that when season three comes along that my reaction to the show as a whole stays constant and doesn't dip.",1253059200,3,1405,4.124087591240876

The writers have some challenges ahead and some pitfalls to avoid. Would like to see ""Ramona Nowitzki"" (""The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem"")come back and maybe even be Sheldon's girlfriend. Sheldon is the only character that hasn't 'hooked up', and the writers have to answer that question sooner or later. They also have to be careful how and how much they tease the Leonard and Penny storyline, because they can only go to that well x many times before it might wear thin.

3575233,5,B001FB4VXU,"This show is quite awesome. I am a computer geek, comic collector, fantasy gamer, with many similar hobbies and mannerisms to many of the characters on this show. The inside geek jokes are truly gems. My wife loves the show also because she is a non geek who has put up with my hobbies for so many years that she is reminded of us in several episodes. I have seen most of these episodes and have pre-ordered this season. The episodes I have seen from this season (about 75%) led me to order season 1 on DVD. Season 1 was FANTASTIC, and I am sure the episodes I have missed from this season will be just as good. The episodes I caught I loved, and definitely warrant repeat watching.

This is truly a show that relies on it's ensemble cast. When the four main geek characters get together it is always magical. The actor playing Sheldon is my favorite and deserves multiple emmies.

SOAP BOX TIME:
I have a comment on the future of this show. A few times this season the writers have portrayed the geek side of the characters in a harsher negative light. They should celebrate these aspects instead. Show the hobbies and obsessions as they are in all their glory, and let the audience judge the level of acceptance. We fanboys already know what we do is not necessarily the ""social norm"", but our numbers are growing; Millions play WoW or online games, the San Diego Comicon has become a celebrated cultural phenomenon, D&D and other games like Magic the Gathering are quite popular, and SciFi and fantasy are becoming more and more accepted forms of mainstream entertainment. (Lord of the Rings anyone?)

This show is too good to fall into the sterotypical trap of labeling the geeks as the outcasts to be shunned. It should be less about laughing at them (us), and more about laughing with them (us). So many shows miss this mark and insult what could be a huge audience share. This only happened once or twice this season that I remember, mainly in situations where Leonard was trying too hard to be ""normal"" to impress Penny.",1249948800,3,2028,4.550684931506849

A show like this would have lots more to offer by way of DVD extras and I think the previous set was sorely lacking.

Commentaries are fine but there could be more.
Bloopers and gag reels for one. More interviews, maybe even some with their physics experts (which we know the show employs). Pop culture reference trivia. And plenty more.

For a show that mines the geek culture with such brilliance, the DVD set is found wanting. Quite the irony. I will still buy this because I love the show, but I wish the DVD producers would step up.

3575304,5,B001FB4VXU,"Every situation comedy (sitcom) has to come up with a unique angle to view reality through, in the hopes of finding the humor in life.  In the past, this was generally done in family situations with ""zany"" characters.  That type of sitcom has also largely been done to death.  Even the ""group of funny friends"" situation is starting to be overdone.  Friends did it.  How I Met Your Mother is currently doing it (very well I might add), Seinfeld did it, etc.

In ""The Big Bang Theory"" we are thrust into the lives of 3 genius level scientists, and one super-genius level scientist.  The story needed its ""Spock"" or ""Mr. Data"" to explain to the rest of us what on Earth they were talking about, so we got Kaley Cuoco playing the lay-person's character of ""Penny.""  As the genius scientists have to explain to her what they are talking about, it clues the rest of us in too.

The result of the situation this comedy is taking place in, is an inside look into a world most of us have never seen, nor do we understand.  As someone who took both levels of introductory physics (and passed!) in college, I can tell you that their subject matter is accurate, and also way over the undergraduate level.  The characters are pure genius, and pretty much every episode is hilarious and filled with heart.

I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for a good sitcom to watch.  It isn't a ""science show"" -- no more than ""Sports Night"" was a ""sports show.""  It is a comedy show, and it is darn funny!

3575476,5,B001FB4VXU,"Season 1 of this purely genius show really set the tone for what has rapidly become my ultimately favourite sitcom. The show is based around 4 unsociable nerds and their relationship with their socially integrated neighbour, Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The four friends are Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Raj (Kunal Nayyar), Howard (Simon Helberg) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons).

 In many of the American sitcoms, there is always the one stand out character that means you watch the show whenever you can as they never fail to make you chuckle. In ""Friends"" it was mainly either Chandler or Joey and in ""Frasier"", for me it was always Niles. So in Big Bang Theory their stand out character is without a doubt, Sheldon, played by the fantastic Jim Parsons. He is the socially inept but academically gifted and uptight gem of the entire series. From the minute he enters the screen, he owns the show with his uptight ways and the intelligence with which he delivers his lines.

During the course of Season 1, the relationship between Leonard and Penny was explored as a way of removing it from any future possibility allowing the characters to be focused on in more personal detail. In Season 2 we are treated to a number of excellent treats including Leonards mother coming to visit, Sheldon trying to become more sociable by creating a friendship algorithm and trying to get a grip on sarcasm.

Out of the entire second season, I have two favourite episodes that I can watch again and again, and it's thanks to the genius of the Sheldon character. ""The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis"" is just genius and perfectly encapsulates the character of Sheldon into one brilliant episode. Penny buys Sheldon a Christmas gift and now has an obligation to buy her a gift of equal monetary value. Alternatively, Leonard meets his intellectual superior who enters into a relationship with Penny, leaving Leonard a bit on the jealous side. The exchanging of gifts is the truly splendid moment of the episode as the gift Penny has bought for Sheldon is a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock); the reaction has to be witnessed.

""The Maternal Capacitance"" is also another stunning episode and is purely down to the introduction of a new Sheldon-esque character; Leonard's Mother (Christine Baranski). She's a psychiatrist completely detached from any emotional feelings and around others is emotionally and socially awkward. Sheldon on the other hand appears completely comfortable around her and as she's alienating everybody else; she gets on swimmingly with Sheldon. This is a character I would want to see more of in the future as her initial appearance was divinely hysterical.

A season of belly laughs that leaves an opening for a promising third and fourth season and any fan should own this set upon its release.",1241136000,35,2791,4.940298507462686

It is witty, sarcastic and charming in equal measure. The characters are loveable and you get invovled in their lives very quickly. Their complete lack of social understanding is great to watch (particularly Sheldon).

I look forward to the show being on every week and think series 3 is the best yet - Leonard's mother is brilliant and the friends link between Penny and the lads develops nicely.

Hope there are many more to come!",1240531200,3,572,4.588235294117647
3575478,5,B001FB4VXU,"This is by far the best/most underrated sitcom/show on T.V.  Very smart! Laugh-out-loud funny!  Unlike most ""sit-com's"", you are guaranteed to ""laugh-out-loud"" a few times during each and every episode. Terrific ensemble cast and tremendous writing.  Their should definitely be numerous award nominations and hopefully wins for acting, writing, ensemble cast, etc.  A treat!",1237939200,16,374,5.87037037037037
3575479,5,B001FB4VXU,"There is very little on TV that I consider worth watching. Big Bang is at the top of the list. This show has excellent writing,excellent character development,and excellent acting. The 1st year was great and the 2nd is just as good. This is one series that you can watch over and over and it's just as enjoyable as the first time.",1237766400,36,330,4.426229508196721
3575480,5,B001FB4VXU,"This show has got to be one of the most original comedies in a long time.  It's nice to have a break from sitcoms with conventional characters.  Plenty of shows have had the typical ""geek"" such as Urkel or Screech, but it's nice to see a show that dared make eccentric geniuses stars of the show.  It never fails to make me laugh so hard to the point of tears.  I hope Big Bang Theory lasts many many seasons.",1237075200,9,409,4.139240506329114
3575481,5,B001FB4VXU,Can't wait for the 2nd Season to come out. Is cool to watch w/o comericals breaks.,1236470400,9,82,4.1875
3575482,5,B001FB4VXU,"Started watching this half way through the 1st season. Became a fan immediately. I even bought 5 more DVDs for my friends and family as Christmas gifts and now they are hooked too. The writing is smart and fun. I catch something new every time I watch it, whether it is a prop, clothing or dialogue. Makes me have a good laugh every time. I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out on DVD even though I have watched all the episodes so far. I know I have missed things in each episode",1234569600,76,485,4.11578947368421
3575483,5,B001FB4VXU,"I used to tune in to the Big Bang Theory, simply because it was on before ""How I Met Your Mother"".  That lasted for all of three episodes.  Now I look forward more to this show.  The writing and acting are out of this world, and with the way Leonard acts, that's not much of a stretch.  I have no doubt that this show will make it over the 4 season hump and who knows where it will end.

The characters are real and you care about them in no time at all.  If that doesn't convince you of the shows qualities, nothing will.  When you start caring for the characters, the story doesn't have to be spot-on every time and that is a writer's dream!",1233964800,7,643,4.055555555555555
3575484,5,B001FB4VXU,"I think this sitcom belongs up there with the all time greats- I love Lucy, All in the Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, (insert your favorite classic sitcom here).  I purchased the first season, and can't wait for the second to become available.  Sheldon is just so ""out there"".  I love the whole cast.",1233187200,48,302,4.660377358490566
