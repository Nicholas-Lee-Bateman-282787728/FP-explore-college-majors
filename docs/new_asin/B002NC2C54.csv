8375004,5,B002NC2C54,"Another great story by Kotaro Isaka turned into a plot-twisting adventure with some of the most lovable characters you'll ever meet. Yukiko, the perfect time-keeper and driver. Naruse, the human lie-detector. Kuon, the expert pickpocket. And Kyouno who'd like more romance in his life. Expect to be surprised and happy.",1501545600,,319,5.4
8375005,5,B002NC2C54,"A cheerful gang turns the earth is a fun way to look at robbing a bank.  Why be a normal bank robber when you can add into the mix some of your own personality and maybe even get a little applause from the customers when you are done.
I loved this movie from the very first five minutes and all the way through.  If you've ever wanted to see a bank job that ends up good for everyone (except the bank, of course) then I highly recommend this movie.",1372032000,,448,4.022471910112359
