3910079,5,B002DDQVP0,"I have to admit that I am a fan of Joel McCrea, and this is one of his best westerns.  He plays Wyatt Earp, the Marshal of Wichita.  This version is in CinemaScope, which makes it even better.",1355875200,,192,4.026315789473684
3910080,5,B002DDQVP0,"Once again, Wyatt Earp (Joel McCrea) stands up to rowdies hoo-rawin' his town. He tells law-abiding folks backing him he doesn't need a marshal's badge to do it, but wiser heads prevail.

He shot it out with the worst men in Wichita
made every man lay his six-gun down
no one fooled with the marshal of Wichita
and today it's a very nice town.

He had a gal and he courted and married her
she added love to his great renown
folks still speak of the marshal of Wichita
and today it's a very nice town.",1355875200,,500,4.197916666666667
3910081,4,B002DDQVP0,"- As the cowboys gallop wildly into town, the sardonic newspaper editor: ""Here come the history makers.""

Before he tamed Tombstone, Wyatt Earp had already earned a rep as a Kansas lawman. In Wichita, the slogan is ""Where everything goes,"" and certainly that applies to how them rowdy visiting cowboys conduct themselves. Wichita's welfare hinges on the influx of cattlemen who periodically ride into town after long cattle drives. Except that these same cowpokes tend to get out of hand. As a measure against the cowboys' most raucous excesses, the town council hires the reluctant Earp (Joel McCrea) as marshall, never mind that Earp only wants to set up his own little business shop. But what happens when Earp's hard stance on law and order jeopardizes the very core of the town's prosperity? Well, you get the makings of a wild west legend.

Of all the many movies to chronicle the life of Wyatt Earp, 1955's WICHITA is one of the least violent and most low-key. Instead, the film depends on its solid cast and director Tourneur's expert execution and its narrative's penetrating psychological underpinnings. Tex Ritter sings the title track, except that it's a pretty forgettable tune, so what was the point?

WICHITA portrays Earp as absolutely implacable in the setting and enforcing of his peacekeeping policies. When one such imposed rule - which bans civilians from bearing firearms in public - threatens to dissuade cattlemen from coming to Wichita, the town council and Earp arrive at loggerheads, with some of the council going to nastier lengths to oust Earp as marshall. Really, the most fascinating bit about this film is how this idealogical dichotomy plays out. Wichita is booming because of the incoming flow of cattle business, but at the cost of damage to town property and, sometimes, to townspeople. Again, Earp's methods leave no room for compromise. His big picture concerns public safety more so than filling up the town coffers. Conversely, the town elders are nursing their tiny trail town's potential for growth. And, honestly, both perspectives are valid.

Joel McCrea is an underrated western star. Referred to in the film as a ""pretty good-sized man,"" he lends a laconic, authoritative presence to the screen, never mind that he is a bit too, er, seasoned for his love interest Vera Miles. Other recognizable names pepper this picture. Lloyd Bridges plays a shifty cowboy. Peter Graves plays one of Wyatt's brothers. For those steeped in wild west lore, Bat Masterson (Keith Larsen) walks in as a fearless apprentice newspaperman. Of course, it's not too long before he becomes Earp's deputy. WICHITA won't immediately surface in most folk's memory when thinking of movies about Wyatt Earp. That's their loss.",1355616000,3,2742,5.073170731707317
3910082,5,B002DDQVP0,I recall seeing this as a kid at a Saturday matinee. Our hero Wyatt Earp (Joel Mc Crea) goes up against of group of hard driving trail hurders and some of the towns folk who don't like his strict methods fearing he'll cost the town business from these cowboys who come in and tear up the place. A young Peter Graves as an Earp brother. Good old fashioned (read - the way the used to make them and still should be) western. Good cast and great color plus widescreen. And as an additional inducement - Tex Ritter sings the title song. Highly recommend!,1340928000,4,550,4.349514563106796
3910083,4,B002DDQVP0,"Allied Artists Pictures presents ""WICHITA"" (1955) (81 min/Color) -- Starring Joel McCrea, Vera Miles, Lloyd Bridges, Wallace Ford, Edgar Buchanan, Peter Graves, John Smith & Keith Larsen

Directed by Jacques Tourneur

Filmed around the same time as Gunfight at the OK Corral, Wichita is another entertaining slant on the Wyatt Earp legend. Joel McCrea does his usual smooth, underplayed job as Wyatt Earp, who aims to bring law and order to the wide-open cow town of Wichita. At first he isn't interested in becoming Marshal but when cowboys ""shoot up the town"" and a little boy get skilled then Wyatt takes the job. He quickly finds himself in a bind: law and order or the money the cowboys bring to town. His least popular move is to take away the guns of everyone in town, no matter how important. So now he has the business people against him as well as the cowboys and its all going to come to a head. Wyatt seeks helped by his brothers James (John Smith) and Morgan (Peter Graves) along with Bat Masterson (Keith Larsen). Linking the storyline is an off screen ballad, sung High Noon style by Tex Ritter.

A great story, well told (in cinemascope & technicolor) and with McCrea in topnotch form!

Jacques Tourneur knew how to give an extra touch to what could be an average western, which also has some remarkable actors like Lloyd Bridges, Edgar Buchanan and the eternal bad guy, Jack Elam.  There is a great scene when Wyatt first shows up, almost a dot at the top of the hill.  Well directed by Jacques Tourneur . Rating : Very Good Western , well worth a view.

3910086,5,B002DDQVP0,"This little Western, expertly directed by Jacques Tourneur and with a ""hit"" title song sung by Tex Ritter, should get more notice. McCrea is a natural for the marshal who cleans up Wichita, despite the ravages of some unhappy trail herders (including Lloyd Bridges), and faces down a commercial element (including Edgar Buchanan) who don't quite want that much ""law and order."" The action is plentiful and rapid, the photography excellent, and the dialogue crisp. The final scene is unforgettable. In short, this is a Western that will gladden the heart of any ole' Cowboy fan.

With a title song by Tex Ritter, beautiful photography, a solid cast, and McCrea's ease in the saddle as Wyat Earp, WICHITA is a classic Western, full of action and highly recommended.

3910094,2,B002DDQVP0,"I downloaded this film because the movie critic of a national publication picked Witchita as his old movie of the week. He thinks that it is a parable about law and order--gun control in particular; that the director used the film to bring many important issues on this subject to light. The critic reminds me of those academics desperately trying to find a new subject for their thesis that pick on an obscure author or work and mine it for themes of major importance but dig up fool's gold.

This movie is a typical, traditional Hollywood western with a poorly written script and some mediocre acting that tells a story with as much reality and believability as the lowest of pulp fiction plots. The hero is Wyatt Earp but this is no biography. Nor are cowboys portrayed realistically: these guys are outlaws and their boss doesn't mind them trying to rob a visitor to their camp.

Cowboys shooting up the town kill a five year-old boy and slightly wound a saloon girl. The marshal arrests the cowboys for disorderly conduct. No one in the town seems upset that a boy was killed--no reaction is shown by the townspeople. Since the boy's death is ignored, the scrip must have the wife of the town's richest, most powerful man--who opposed banning guns in town--accidently shot by the bad guys. Now some reaction is shown, the killers brought to justice and the marshal's strict law and order approach justified.

The plot is just too simplified and unrealistic. But then, there's the school shootings in several states with the NRA vs. law and order and the great majority of citizens' wishes ignored.  Maybe the director was on to something.

On the level of action and fights, the movie reverts to the early style of shooting six-guns from the hands of bad guys and a bloodless fistfight. The action is too stylized to generate much excitement.

For excellent movies with a message that were also made in the 1950s, see High Noon or Shane.",1415664000,,1942,4.713864306784661
