8512089,3,B0077PBPPK,"I bought the Horror Triple Feature: Volume 1 Blu-Ray from Amazon and enjoyed it.  So I decided to buy the Horror triple Feature: Volume 2 Blu-Ray.  Since it appears that I am the first one to write a review, you know what?  I am enjoying this one slightly less than I enjoyed Volume 1.  So if you like decent B-Rate movies, with excellent Video Transfers, this is the video pack for you (& Volume 1 as well.).
  Just to update, I am plowing through this as quick as I am able to.  Scar was actually pretty decent.  It had Christopher Titus & Angela Bettis staring.  And while low budget, was pretty ok.  Terror Trap stared David James Elliot, Micael Madsen, & Jeff Fahey.  This definately, I can say, regardless of how much I like B-Rate movies, was not very good.  Midnight Movie was definately B-Rate like Scar was.  It was mediocre as far as this type of fare goes.  It borrowed from so many movies that were A-List and other B-List movies it wasn't funny.  I had an easier time stating what other films this one didn't borrow from.  But all in all, it was an ok watch.
  The Triple Horror Feature Volume 1 was definately better.  The Movies in this Triple Feature Volume, I felt were a notch down from Volume 1.  I consider this an ok buy. Definately not the worst buy I have ever made.  I will definately be keeping this, & Volume 1, in my collection regardless.  I just can't help likeing B-Rate Films.
