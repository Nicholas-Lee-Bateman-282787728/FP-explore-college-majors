5529090,4,B00AZEWDMY,Foley was quite the singer song writer with some real demons on his trail. I learned about him from his friend Gorf Morlix.,1368316800,,123,4.391304347826087
8559550,5,B00AZEWDMY,"I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good, and then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye, to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand, and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun, and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing somewhere everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bear

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again",1529366400,,714,3.7466666666666666
8559551,4,B00AZEWDMY,Interesting story of the life of talented guy.,1525737600,,46,4.875
8559552,4,B00AZEWDMY,"Decent documentary. Editing could have been improved... the film ""dragged"" at certain points. That being said, Blaze was an AMAZING MAN, an AMAZING POET/SONGWRITER, and I would have liked a little more focus on his musical genius, and less of the ups and downs of his career. Could been more emotive if it focused more on Blaze's character; more stock footage of Blaze himself (maybe there isn't a lot) and his creative process. Still, a decent film.",1518480000,,450,4.857142857142857

8559558,5,B00AZEWDMY,"This is, first, a well produced work about an intriguing artist, Blaze Foley. It lays it all out: his early life, his formative creative years, his work, his weaknesses and how it all ended. We can easily wish it was tied up in a neater and more productive package but, if so, we would not have Blaze as he was. He is a mixture of all the creative, original and talented wordsmiths you know; he just did not enjoy the commercial success....during his lifetime...that others did. Much of this was of his own doing but circumstances and the times contributed. His story will move you: his loves, his obvious talents, his bent toward destructive and non-productive actions will leave you somewhat wishing, ""What if...""  But then, it would not be the same story. In the end, you just wish there was more; isn't that the way all great stories end?",1395360000,4,842,4.613333333333333
