1879343,4,B000095J01,"THIS IS GREAT ""HOOD"" MOVIE WITH A LOT OF STARS IN IT. I 1ST SAW THIS ON BET, BUT IT WAS EDITED FOR TV. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANY WHO COLLECT GOODIES LIKE FRESH, G, AND CLOCKERS!!",1250467200,7,177,3.810810810810811
1879344,5,B000095J01,"""Lift"" is a great film addressing organized urban crime. The more significant message, however, is the depiction of inter-generational patterned behavior. Kerry Washington and Lonette Mckee shine as mother and daughter each acting out of their own individual emotional turmoil. The interaction is remarkably true to life. Director Demane Davis brings inter-generational issues to the surface and forces viewers to face behaviors most people would rather hide in their closets. Watch it!",1241827200,6,486,5.763888888888889
1879345,5,B000095J01,"This was an excellent movie.  Well written and well acted.  I wish this movie had a sound track.  I really liked the song ""Solitaire"" that played at the end.",1235433600,4,157,4.344827586206897
1879346,5,B000095J01,"This one is like watching a home video of someone you know personally. Although I don't agree with (or condone) much of what Niecy does, I can most definitely understand her making the decisions she made.  Just watching the relationship between her and her mother made things easier to relate to.

Often times, it's the very same people that hold you to unobtainable standards, that push you to do emorale and/or illegal things in the first place.  It's the unspoken words that sometimes hold the heaviest weight.

Without giving away any plot destroying information, I would like to say that this film proves that there are those out there on the wrong path that can, and will be able to turn their lives around for the better...

As always, Kerry Washington gives a brilliant performance.

I highly recommend this film...",1172534400,15,823,4.8428571428571425
1879347,5,B000095J01,All the cast did their thing! I also noticed that some Bosyon Hip Hop artists were in there like Beyonder and DL! That was hot!,1167696000,4,127,4.12
1879348,5,B000095J01,"If I never see another film, my thirst for sincere and captivating performances will be quenched by the shining Ms. Washington and the amazing Barbara Montgomery. This film, despite its rather gloomy setting, is eventually all about redemption and hope. The stories of those in Lift are noble, real narratives about love, courage, and transformations. I loved seeing Kerry Washington running so fast in this movie and she was pregnant and not wearing running shoes.",1133827200,8,465,5.213333333333333
1879349,5,B000095J01,"Just like life, every character in this movie has flaws... including the intelligent and clean-cut main character who's shoplifting big-ticket items even though she has a nice job. Her mother requests an expensive necklace, which will require a jewelry store heist to acquire. She decides to go ahead with the robbery, although her boyfriend begs her not to do it. To complicate things, she then learns that she is pregnant. Is she willing to risk everything to please her selfish mother? This movie gets into the psyche of each character, which is really the reason I loved watching it. It's not about stealing as much as it is about family, forgiveness and love.",1076889600,10,664,4.884955752212389

1879505,4,B000095J01,The movie moves fast. It is however; a reality check on our morals and life principles. There were three generations and no one stopped the insanity. Robbing others is never an acceptable practice.,1353024000,2,197,5.0

1879509,5,B000095J01,"I purchased this movie because I kept seeing the case in Blockbuster but they never had the movie.  I like this film. Kerry Washington pl layed a great roll as a booster of high priced merchandise.  She was so smooth in everything that she did, but eventually had to pay the consequences. I would definitely recommend this movie. I like the look of the film in that it is not highly stylized but looks like an independent film.",1309910400,,427,4.461538461538462

7989563,5,B000095J01,It isn't the movie of the year. It didn't even make it to the big screen. But it is still a good watch. I gave 5 stars because I'm a little biased towards it. My sister is in it with a couple of speaking parts. Plus it was filmed in Boston which I am very familiar with. One of the apartments used is the identical layout to my friends unit that is in the same complex. It is a nostalgia thing with me.,1493856000,,402,3.855421686746988
