A group of kids nicknamed The Goonies try to save their small town in Astoria from property development hell, and go in search for the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willy. What follows is a great  load of gags and little adventures. Great to watch with the kids. This  bunch of actors were supposed to be the new generation of brat-packers but  it never really came off for them-pity but it's a still great film!",912124800,,441,4.419753086419753

No matter how old you are, watching The Goonies brings you back to that childhood moment when anything was possible. To me this is more than a movie and almost an escape from reality of adult responsibility... and I cherish that for the close to hours this gives me. I also have my kids loving the movie so it will continue for another generation.

I believe that this film should be required viewing for everyone and could easily solve most of the major issues plaguing our society. We are all Goonies, we just need to let that side out more.",1516492800,,706,4.229629629629629

596819,5,6303212379,"Like any child of the 1980s, I wanted to a ""Goonie"" especially after I watched this film. ""Goonies"" aired on HBO where it was the first movie that I ever videotaped on VHS in my video library. ""Goonies"" is a fun-filled adventure from start to finish with a stellar cast. Brilliant casting of Josh Broil and Sean Astin are the Walsh brothers. Corey Feldman was perfectly cast as Mouth. Jeff Cohen was perfect as Chunk. Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton play Andrea Carmichael and Stephanie Steinbrenner respectively. Perhaps, Anne Ramsey became the unlikely breakout star as Mama Fratelli. She would sadly pass away a couple of years later.

The story of a group of outcasts in Astoria, Oregon go on an unforgettable treasure hunt during a fall weekend in 1985. The story is as entertaining as the film which has become a cult classic. The cast of unforgettable characters and a somewhat believable story where they try to find a buried treasure in the underground world. Each one of the Goonies have a talent whether Data for his inventions; Mouth for knowing Spanish; Andie for knowing the piano; and Chunk for befriending a lonely deformed man.

The film comes with the Making of the movie including a cameo from Steven Spielberg. It was nice to see the behind the scenes of the film. Cyndi Lauper's ""Goonies are Good Enough"" video is extended to include the cast and friends from the Wrestling era like Andre the Giant and her mother.",1516147200,,1435,4.759036144578313

It was definitely better as a childhood memory.

I didn't dock a star for that. I docked a star from the profanity that laces this film! It's not the most entertaining movie for an adult, so you'd figure it would be kid-safe... Man, they dropped so many swear words...",1511827200,2,579,4.123893805309734

597002,5,6303212379,""" The Goonies ""  Has grown far past a movie of cult classic status & into the realms of a Pop culture classic & a must have movie for serious movie collectors building a movie library!!!  For starters you have a 80's Icon Cyndi Lauper providing the Goonies a theme song ( The Goonies 'R' Good Enough) which if memory serves me right was a Top 50's Billboard Hit Song as well as a M.T.V. classic video!  Then you have a group of child actors that acted well enough to endear their characters to audiences for decades to come!!!  While this family friendly action, adventure, comedy movie is set in the 1980's it is in no way a dated movie feeling as fresh & fun as when I watched it for the first time while on leave from the service.  This movie will never become "" Dated"" as long as cultural hang ups exist like High School "" Clichs""  & Greed & attitudes from the rich that loving, struggling "" Middle Class"" or "" working Class "" family's are disposable & to be looked down upon !!!  And since the gap between the super wealthy & the now almost non existing "" Middle Class"" is so huge I don't see "" The Goonies"" becoming a "" dated Movie any time soon !!!  "" The Goonies"" was & remains a feel good movie that the whole family can enjoy.  "" The Goonies"" also proves you don't need Billions of dollars spent on explosions & C.G.I. images to make a successful film.  It's also fun to see how many of the child actors have grown to be successful adult actors...even if it makes me feel a bit old.  Josh Brolin son of James Brolin has grown to become an A-list Hollywood star & Sean Astin  seems to be in a Hollywood Block Buster every decade or so...but has been in a list of movies any actor would be proud of!!!  When a movie has become so saturated into "" Pop Culture"" that it is referenced in T.V. shows, Sit Com's & other Movies it has left "" Cult Classic"" far behind & has moved into the status of "" Classic Movies"" !!!  "" The Goonies"" has done just that entertaining  movie fans for 3 decades & watching my children adding "" The Goonies"" to their movie library's I am sure my Grandchildren will be adding it to theirs as they start family's of their own!!!  The D.V.D. I ordered said it had no extra or bonus features but the widescreen version I received has lots of extra's... even great "" Out Take"" scene's that help clear up the whole "" Scary Octopus."" statement that had confused many over the years, l.o.l .  I am very pleased with my purchase & the D.V.D. version I got to replace my old V.H.S. !!!  Thank you Amazon.com for offering this classic at such a great affordable price!!!!!",1510704000,2,2594,4.237804878048781

597041,1,6303212379,"I'm gonna get reamed for this, but I'm sorry. The Goonies sucks.

All of you who like it need to step outside of yourselves for a moment and realize that the only reason you like it is because you watched it when you were a kid. Admitting to liking it now is admittance of the de-evolutionary powers of your brain. It's saying your mind has the cognitive capacity of an eight-year old, which is a real step down for most of you (and a step up for some).

If the nostalgia outweighs any cinematic problems, that's fine, admit you enjoy the nostalgia factors. But to say it's a good movie is like saying Rambo II or Rocky IV or Labyrinth are ""quality"" films. They're just... not. But they hold a nostalgia factor, so people like them. And that's alright.

All I'm saying is that The Goonies is a poorly made film and people need to come to terms with that.",1509321600,,854,4.325

597376,5,6303212379,"If you grew up in the 80s and didn't see The Goonies, I suspect there are holes in your childhood. Instantly accessable to parent and child alike, Spielberg manages to take a silly story about a treasure hunt and turn it into an exciting, scary, romantic comedy about a group of outcasts coming together for a common cause.

The Prime version does omit some scenes as seen in the original theatrical release, but what remains is a compelling story to share with your whole family. There are some scary bits that younger children may need explained to them, but they're handled in a kid friendly manner that shouldn't keep any young ones up all night.

In short, the Prime version of Goonies is certainly ""Good Enough"" for your video collection. Buy it.",1499644800,2,752,4.6893939393939394

Every time I watch this movie it takes me back to my childhood full of the adventure and magic of the 80s.  For some reason back then adults liked to immerse kids in stories full of magic and wonder like The Neverending Story, Labyrinth, and a countless list of others.  Even in adult film this magic was able to be captured in movies like Dune.  These all felt like big budget films.  This film takes a group of younger and a couple other older kids coming of age into a timeless adventure looking for a way to save their homes.  When you include a few unforgettable bad guys, a nice freak named Sloth, and... a pirate ship??.. you just can't help but get drawn in to the story.  Great movie.  Great time.  Love it!

597475,2,6303212379,"Movies in the 70s and especially 80s doubled down on the obscenities and adult stuff, even kids movies (Meatballs comes to mind). I think filmakers thought they had to push the ""we're getting so grown up"" thing at the time, to get away from those repressive 50s. It was a different time for sure.

That said, this movie really is loud and charmless and pretty much unbearable. To an 8 year old it might be great stuff, but when I've heard adult friends say ""I love Goonies, it's the best!"", I think, are you serious? Spielberg is a genius but this must be his low-water mark. I'd check out something like Super 8 instead -  much better movie.",1495238400,,642,4.432203389830509

599167,5,6303212379,"I own this DVD and I have watched the film about five times over the last 30 years. I feel compelled to write a review because of all the negative reviews that site bad language and juvenile humor as the foundation of 1 and 2 star reviews. This movie is a great fantasy film for children. Not 5 year-olds, and probably not for adults that watched this for the first time long after the whimsy and possibilities of youth have faded in favor of the more practical burdens of adulthood. For a 9 year old of either gender, this movie will resonate and entertain.

[Some Spoilers Ahead] A group of teenagers find out that they will have to leave their beloved neighborhood because a large land developer has plans to demolish their childhood homes and build some new monstrosity. This first major taste of the disappointment of adulthood is met by an attitude of grudging disbelief by the children, and they embark on an exciting and hazard filled adventure to discover lost pirate treasure that will secure their homes and prevent the loss of their childhood refuge. Relying on a local legend, which is part of the soulful and colorful heritage of their home town, the movie shows the kids living a wish fulfillment fantasy story where the meek are brave, the ridiculed are heroic, the helpless are empowered and even a ""monster"" can become an ally if shown the slightest bit of kindness. It all ends with the solidification of relationships between these children (even though they don't always appear to get along or even like one another) and the innocence of childhood is permitted to continue because they save their neighborhood and homes from destruction.

This all takes place in a world where parents are powerless to help these kids and most other adults are just downright mean. This is all part of the fantasy narrative, and taking away a reliance on adults for security and rescue in all circumstances is required for these young people to find self-reliance and realize that they too bear some responsibility for the events of their lives. This is the type of movie that occasionally ends with one or more characters waking up and realizing that it was all a dream. That is a tired and too often relied upon literary (cinematic) device, and I find Chris Columbus' refusal to end this movie really brave and refreshing. Of course this is all a silly fantasy, but it is a movie, and the fantasy is for the benefit of the viewer. There really is no need to bind the kids int eh film to the harsh reality that this sort of fantastic and heroic journey that saves the day is just nearly impossible.

Of course, they have seen behind the veil. These kids can never go back to being who or what they were at the beginning, and you can see that the journey they have taken has changed each character in some meaningful way that moves them one step closer to adulthood and responsibility.
There is some bad language. There are some crude jokes. This is a movie that charmingly captures the unfiltered and unedited discourse of children when they are outside of the supervision of adults. Parents have to use their discretion if this is the type of movie that they want their children to see, and they need to have the wisdom to know when their own children have moved beyond the stage where they will parrot bad behavior without understanding that what's appropriate in one setting may not be allowed or appropriate in another.
All that being said. . . I would hate to live in a world where my daughter was forever cut-off from taking the journey to One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship or one where she would never get to chuckle at the Truffle Shuffle.",1473897600,,3647,4.633693972179289

It's full of adventure and excitement and interesting characters and pirate treasure. Though kids and teens are the stars, there are adult characters too, and it doesn't feel like a kids' movie. The quotable lines are endless: ""Slick shoes? Are you crazy?"" ""I smell ice cream..."" ""I feel like I'm babysitting except I'm not getting paid."" ""HEY YOU GUYS!"" ""Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to my house to use the bathroom. But his sister did!"" I still watch this regularly and am now 35.

599662,2,6303212379,"It's hard to go against the grain and talk bad about a movie that has a huge following but I think this movie is a dud. Yes, it's a Speilberg story and I'm sure it looked great on paper. Yes, there are a lot of familiar faces and that's cool. The set design is amazing, the music is also great. But that's really where the good things end. The acting is subpar, the dialogue is pretty bad, it's cheesy and not in a funny way, but in a cringey way. The movie is crude and very scripted. Everything feels set up like a theme park for the characters to run around in. You can predict everything from beginning to end. The plot is very thin, the characters are annoying stereotypes, but even worse than that they never stop shouting throughout the entire movie. The kids are constantly talking, yelling, and bickering. It gets old very quickly and doesn't make for an enjoyable movie with good pacing or tone.

Sean Astin seemed like the only proper character and talented actor in the entire cast. Maybe good for kids, but then again there's language and sexual innuendos. For adults? No way. I know it's a popular movie but it's cartoonish, loud, and dumb. Not for me. Anyone remembering this movie fondly from their childhood, more power to you, I've got tons of movies like that.

It checked off every box on a child's movie wishlist.  This movie was the most amazing adventure shared with your best friends!  That's a kids dream!  I loved that they found a treasure map with a mystery they had to solve and had traps along the way, go down water slides, and at the end found the ""rich stuff.""  I will never forget when the Fratelli's set off One Eyed Willies booby trap and the rocks break away and the ship sails out in the ocean.  The Goonies are walking up to the police on the shore and then the police officer sees the pirate ship sailing in the ocean and says, ""Mary mother of God....look at that!""  I got goosebumps all over and chills up my spine.  I still get that every time I watch that scene.  I remember going to school the next day and telling my friends about it and we would play Goonies at recess.  There are so many great quotable lines.  They never get old!  I couldn't wait until my daughter got old enough to watch this movie.  We thought 9 was the right age for her to watch it.  Was it the right age?  Probably not after watching it with her and realizing the humor is a little bit more appropriate for older kids.  But, she loves it and we have so much fun watching it together.

Within the first 15 minutes, there are sexual innuendos that would today, likely be rated PG-13 (I believe this movie was made before the introduction of the PG-13 rating system). Usually I love movies that are a bit dated but in my opinion, the humor in this was too raunchy for the kid actors to be dishing out and overshadowed the real story here.

Back in the 80s I was a DJ, & I still have that 12"" Eight Arms To Hold You vinyl in a box, & was intrigued by the cover design to accommodate with the movie with skull & crossbones. The dub song is pretty good too although it was not a major hit, I also have not seen or heard of Cyndi s song video which was good. The outages & deleted scenes were interesting & it's a shame they couldn't fit those scenes in the final print. I found a lot of parts of the main movie hard to deal with especially the outdated female hard core villain who is a joke following those kids through that dangerous cavern in heels. The fat kid was a total nuisance & I even muted most of his BS dialogue. At times he looked exactly like a frustrated beaver with choppers to boot. The love scenes were unnecessary & the making out with both brothers gave me the ""eww"".

I managed to get through the first 15 minutes, then lost interest and stopped watching this rambling and pointless mess.

There is no defeating The Goonies. It is a masterpiece. Action and comedy, rolled into a tiny ball of joy. Ready to be consumed at any time. You cannot go wrong.

My teenagers have all seen it and they love it just as much as I do, but my 9 year old daughter mentioned the other day that she had never seen it!! Um, excuse me?! How did I let this happen???

Most of my older DVDs ended up scratched or missing (thanks, kids!) so I hopped online to order another copy. My new copy of The Goonies arrived yesterday so you better believe we watched it last night after dinner. My husband was at work but I gathered up the kids and we all watched it together. The older ones had seen it many times, but they were still excited to watch it again. My 9 year old daughter LOVED it! She was so happy that I purchased the Blu-ray rather than just renting it online. Now she can watch it anytime.

How this film attained cult status from around the world is beyond this grandad, but Spielberg always manages to get the goose to lay the golden egg. Last year purportedly 15,000 people came to Astoria, Oregon where the movie was filmed 30 years ago. I live across the Columbia River from Astoria and a friend of mine grew up in the house next door when the movie was filmed. Remember the Rube Goldberg machined the boys put together? My friend has the egg used in the movie to start the contraption! It's actually a machined ball-bearing ground down to an egg and painted white.

So when I saw it on DVD, yes, I snatched it up.  It didn't hurt that the price was so nice either. So the night came, the ""Mom Get's to Pick"" night and yes, Mom popped in The Goonies.  When it was over, the chorus from my teen and her best friend was ""Oh, Mikey, he was so cute...you really do know him.""  It didn't hurt that Martha Plimpton, famous as Virginia from Raising Hope in this house, and Josh Brolin, just famous, are in it as well. A funny little unexpected treat was seeing my 17 year old recognize Mary Alice Trainer, the mom, as the protagonist from our favorite Christmas horror episode of one of the serial shows, maybe Tales from the Darkside...she goes up against a demented Santa played by Larry Drake from ""The Dentist"" and ""LA Law"".",1456704000,7,1000,4.360215053763441

The Goonies are a group of oddballs - Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Chunk, and Data.

They discover a treasure map, that leads the way to the treasure ship of a legendary Pirate - One eyed Willy.  Shortly after they begin their treasure hunt they're joined by 2 girls - Andi and Stef.  To begin the quest they enter a tunnel, beneath an abandoned restaurant.  Too late do they realize the restaurant was a hide out for a family of outlaws - the Fratellis.

The Goonies journey through sewers, into a wishing well, and descend into caverns.  Willy had left several Booby Traps along the way.  Finally finding Willy's ship in an enclosed grotto.  The Fratellis pursuing every step of the way, and nearly catching them several times.",1454630400,,866,4.777027027027027

That felt like they were the misfits, the rejects, that banded together, to stick together to save there neighborhood and stay together.

602524,5,6303212379,"This movie has been an obsession of mine since I was a kid. I have literally watched the film over 300 times (once I hit that epic milestone I stopped counting...). I wrote a song about Goonies/friendship, and did a persuasive speech on Goonies and how everyone can relate to one of them in the movie (I got an A).

This movie is a fun, adventure filled movie that has given me timeless memories. Anytime it rains or is dreary out, I pop it on if I am not busy. Maybe it's because of it being based in rainy Oregon, my love for overcast weather or both. All I know is this movie is a major part of my childhood, teenage years, college, and adult years. It has brought me so many joyous moments. I still laugh at it, especially Chunk's delivery of his line after Mikey's mom sees the broken statue. It brings me to tears.

(and for anyone curious, I was a combination of Mouth, Mikey and Chunk wrapped up into one. Today, I lost the weight but still talk alot and dream big).

603123,5,6303212379,"A total 100% Classic movie, no bones about it, the 80's ""Wizard Of Oz"", and they are releasing a 30th anniversary soundtrack on vinyl on October 9th!!  This local movie theater decided to show ""The Goonies"" on the big screen for free a recent Saturday morning as a ""giving back to the community event"", and I only saw it once before on the big screen at my college back in 1985.  Having seen it hundreds of times on video and edited TV airings (VH1 Classic has been showing it lately as part of their ""Rock & Roll Picture Show"" series), it was amazing to see it in it's full glory and unedited.  I am such a fan of this movie, that I was on vacation in the Pacific Northwest some years ago, and went to where the movie was shot, in Astoria, Oregon, a beautiful, yet small, very hilly, seaside town, 10,000 people, 100 miles northwest of Portland.  Saw the Goonie house, those mailboxes, trestle, all of it, crossed the beautiful Astoria Bridge.  Other movies were filmed in Astoria as well, like ""Kindergarten Cop"" (saw the school), and ""Short Circuit"" (the bridge and house)...the town has movie tours, as well as a lovely mariner/shipping museum.  Highly recommend people to make the trip, especially Goonies fans.  I too wish there would be a sequel, and the cast and Spielberg and Donner and Columbus want to do it as well, BUT I hope I'm wrong that I heard Warners are blocking it from happening??!!??

Anyhoo, not many movies are better than this.  Memorable, fun, quotable dialogue...intricate details...great music (pop songs and score)...adventure that brings out the kid in everybody (who DOESN'T love the idea of a treasure hunt??)...great characters you care about and like/love (even the bumbling Fratelli's), major (Chunk, Mikey, all of em) and minor (Mama Walsh RIP, Rosalita, the little bike girl, etc)...the premise of the movie is utterly timeless and not dated, despite occasional lines like ""1632, is that a year or something??  No, it's your top score in Pole Position.""...I played that arcade game as a kid quite a bit, haha.  There's even parts that are dark and scary enough to scare and thrill kids a tad.

I hope the sequel happens, but really, they could have had a movie/TV spinoff around Chunk and Sloth (the adventures of), and also, 1-Eyed Willy's ship, The Inferno, why no one chased after it, to retrieve all that gold, jewels, etc...it was sailing away with no one at the helm, just a bunch of skeletons, bound to crash at some shore...makes you think...and they could have/should have  restored the octopus scene too...it was referred to by Data, and there is a song on the soundtrack referring to it, ""Eight Arms To Hold You"" by Arthur Baker and the Goon Squad, which was a 12"" dance club hit...just a handful of pieces that should have been connected...

All in all, the Goonies rule...",1440979200,,2823,4.723014256619145
603124,1,6303212379,"I have watched this movie as a teenager and wanted to show it to my wife and our 6-year old boy. The movie contained an off-putting amount of bad language (with adults, as well as kids, using words like ""s--t,"" etc!), meanness and kids screaming at each other, racial stereotypes, etc. Our son was quite scared of the evil crooks, a dead body found by the kids in the walk-in freezer, and the screaming person chained to a chair in the basement. After giving the movie ~25 minutes' chance, we unanimously decided to turn it off. Perhaps we'll try again in a few years, but even for adults this was hard to watch!...

We love the beautiful Astoria, OR. Hated the movie.",1440979200,5,668,4.475409836065574
603125,1,6303212379,"Poorly acted, poorly filmed, poorly edited.  Loud, boring, predictable.  Nostalgia is the only reason to explain the positive reviews.  Watched it as an adult with my wife, first time seeing it.  9 year old daughter tolerated it.  Wife and I hated it.  It's terrible.  Did I mention it's loud?  Stupid and noisy.  It's a lazy movie that tries to get laughs exploiting the fat kid and the asian, and the Mexican maid.  Beyond this, it's just too boring to keep writing about.",1440892800,3,474,4.670731707317073

It's a bit like ""Stand by Me"" but neither geared to teens nor with the feeling of melancholy sadness of Stand by Me, The Goonies are the classic little guys and loosers who triumph over their status and, of course, their tormentors, by following their dreams and beliefs and, of course, in large part precisely because of their quirkiness and the ingenuity they have had to develop exactly because they are not the ""top dogs.""

This movie sucks. I didn't hate it, but I didn't find it enjoyable in the least. The humor and characters are too cheesy and downright weird/creepy sometimes for my tastes. I love kid's movies that I can enjoy on an adult level: Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, The Iron Giant, The Incredibles... truly excellent films for all ages. The makers of this film didn't even try to make it appealing to an adult market.

Great for kids? Sure.

For those that saw it on reel and not on VHS or DVD, the scene that is missing is the octopus scene.  The line when they are being interviewed on the beach talks about the attack of the octopus which for some reason or another was removed before going to the VHS and DVD as well as Prime version.  I saw it every summer for five summers at Camp Seafarer.  I am disappointed that the scene I liked so much has since been removed.

Lots of silly, ridiculous situations happen to the youngsters who find a treasure map and think if they find the treasure they can save the neighborhood.  Screaming kids, dangerous criminals and lots of booby traps keep the action moving.  This is Hollywood so ridiculous is the name of the game.  One does have to be careful of inappropriate language from the kids that you can always expect in a Steve Speilberg film ( who can forget the ""penis breath"" comment from cute Drew Barrymore in ET).  This has several s**t comments, a statue with a broken penis and naming the pirate ""One Eyed Willie"" - like no one was going to get that.  If not for that stuff I would have given the fun film a 4 star.  Young teens are intrigued by that and evidently Speilberg thinks its cute.",1423612800,,971,4.451977401129944

605355,1,6303212379,"Having heard of this movie for years but never having seen it and thinking we might give it for a gift to young relatives, we watched it first. Family members agreed 100% for maybe the first time ever about a movie:  this is the worst movie we have ever seen. It is absolutely mindless and disrespectful of young imaginations.  Apparently Spielberg thinks that simply inserting a ""surprise"" skeleton every few minutes will be a scary element every single time; apparently he thought this movie needed some ""sexual"" elements portrayed with two young teenagers kissing passionately several times, the girl in a very short skirt and at one point her repeatedly chanting, ""I have a great body...I have a great body..."".  Early in the movie, a character driving a car has his rearview mirror adjusted so that he can voyeuristically see the girl(s) in the back seat and the camera focuses on the girl's thighs - again in a very short skirt; later that girl complains about his using the rearview mirror to ""look down my shirt.""  Beyond all that - and the ""s**t"" used quite often, the ""ohmyGod"" used repeatedly and the ""what the hell..."" used very often, the utter stupidity of the story was just maddening. What a waste of time, money and resources at every turn to make this movie and to watch it.  It is the most blatantly crass grab for money I can recall seeing and apparently lots of people - like us - fell for it.  One last comment: it is true that kids love adventure stories with scary elements, just enough ""danger"" to make it scary but not violent and gratuitously dangerous. This movie failed on every count.  That the movie-makers had the gall to even make mention of The Hardy Boys as one character did at one point (""I remember this from the The Hardy Boys"" or something close to that), shows their disrespect for what kids really love when their imaginations and spirits are respected - as in The Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew or ""E.T."" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the like.  This movie is utter drek, drivel, mindless, brainless garbage and to think that a couple of generations of kids have watched it - because of Spielberg or Sean Astin or whatever other reason - is just disheartening. I hated this movie so much and so did my entire family - and we LOVE movies. This does not even qualify to be called ""movie"", just a greedy bit of junk to get people's money.  Ick. Ick.

605536,5,6303212379,"Oh, how I hoped that ""The Goonies"" would stand the test of time! My doubts were strong, though, so I didn't introduce my daughters to it until just recently. This past year, there was a foreign film for families (""Zip & Zap and the Marble Gang"") that screened at the Sundance Film Festival. My husband and I scored tickets and took our daughters. The film was deeply inspired by ""The Goonies"" and ""The Simpsons"" - and in the Q&A after the film with the director, he mentioned how much the film was informed by ""The Goonies"".

Thanks to that ringing endorsement (and the fact that Zip & Zap hasn't been localized for the US), my daughters have been clamoring to see this film. With a bit of hesitance, I fired it up and waited for them to tell me that it was too dated. That moment never came!

606657,2,6303212379,"Saw this back in the day and it didn't stick in my head; watched again here and realize why. While production values were pretty slick, the acting, story, and directing annoyed me big time, like a bunch of primates banging pots and pans in the kitchen.  I figure they were going for some kind of naturalistic vibe with the kid actors, but their constant overlapping high volume chatter (mostly inane) got real old, real quick.  Sean Astin was the only child actor that seemed remotely talented in the context of this movie. The whole film comes across as a low-rent Indiana Jones with kids, but even more implausible.",1406678400,3,617,4.703703703703703
606678,5,6303212379,"So this movie is basically a story about the underdogs versus the so called favorites and the underdogs win.  How many other movies have an asthmatic hero?  It is a great storyline that I believe the majority of people will enjoy.

Furthermore, the film just works.  It reminds me of a Rube Goldberg machine of sorts.  You know, like the different machines that worked together to open Mikey's front gate.  Anyway, the different movie elements work together perfectly to deliver a cinematic production that is a classic.",1406678400,,520,4.919540229885057

606720,4,6303212379,"The Bluray features excellent picture and sound. The extras are impressive, especially flashing back to the 1985 era with the extended Cyndi Lauper video of ""The Goonies R Good Enough"". Yep, she ""managed"" Hulk Hogan in 1985's Wrestlemania, and the video features Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, The Iron Sheik, the late greats Andre The Giant and Classy Freddie Blassie, and  more wrestling stars. This is a really noteworthy inclusion. A nitpik, the extras menu is a challenge to navigate because, strangely, the scrolling through extras choices is nearly impossible to see since the highlighting is really dim. Kind of strange. In the slight chance you are unfamiliar with the movie, it's very Indiana Jones-ish with a who's who of mid-eighties kid stars. Plus a talented array of adult supporting  players. The treasure hunt moves briskly, with lots of thrills and surprises. Just ""dark comedy"" enough to keep kids aged 9 and up as engaged as their parents (probably a little intense for young kids). It made me laugh out loud more than once. Thankfully some nice messaging too about cooperation and skill variety that diverse pals bring to the dance. A fun and lavishly filmed ride. Nice to see the commentary which features the ensemble cast about eleven years after the film was made. You can tell they too really enjoyed it.

I enjoyed this movie as a kid. Watching it as an adult imparted to me the revelation that this is likely the best overall kids movie ever made. It excels in storytelling, humor, compelling adventure that bridges the real and fantastical, and therefore succeeds in taking kids (and adults) along for the Goonies ride. You identify with the Goonies, want to be one, and are one for the length of the movie.

Wow!!! the 1980's were a lot different.  The ""S"" word is said over 20 times.  There were adult themed jokes, shots of the guys looking up the girls skirt and seeing her underwear, etc.  I know a lot of people love this movie, and it appears to have been intended for kids, but there are a lot of swear words and some adult situations.  PG-13 wasn't around back then, but that's probably what it would be rated now.  It's not for the younger kids.",1402704000,,703,4.1940298507462686

This movie, flaws and all, was a spectacular classic.  They simply don't make kids movies like they used to, what with all this Hunger Games and Harry Potter nonsense. Those movies all lend to the notion that you have to be perfect or have magic to accomplish any task whereas this film proves a bunch of normal misfits can go on a glorious adventure and everything turns out fine in the end.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the missing scene with the octopus, which should be included.  If you don't know what I am talking about then you are not missing out, but if you do then there is always a missing gap in the movie.

I have seen little differences however in this movie. The one I usually see there's no octopus around the ship scene I believe, although they mention at the end that, 'The octopus was really scary!' I didn't see any scene with an octopus until watching it on regular TV once. I had this movie on VHS and that wasn't part of it. Don't know why that is but its always been that way. I remember seeing it in the theater and certainly don't remember that part. Why am I paying so much attention to this little detail you may ask? Bc I'm anal like that.

A weak plot, mostly loud and boring characters make for a tedious show made up by a sequence of poorly threaded 'whoa!' moments.  The wonder factor for me vanished way too soon into the movie; after that becoming 'so what?'  On the redeeming side, Sean Austin (later Sam Gamgee of Lord of the Ring fame) brings a reprieve to a listless early example of shock-driven emptiness.

There's a reason The Goonies is beloved by people from my generation; while funny and kid-centered, the writers/directors clearly respected their young audience enough to produce a film that was true to the real joys and fears of childhood, never resorting to crude humor along the way.

608593,2,6303212379,"If you want to see the early start of actors Sean Astin and Josh Brolin, this is an amusing glimpse. Spielberg's fantastic adventure tale, however, underlines why directors don't like working with children and animals. Every line is delivered at top volume, every pratfall exaggerated, every character stereotyped. The plot is entirely predictable: greedy developers are ruining our town and foreclosures are rife, so what shall our pre-teen heroes do? Find a treasure map, ride their bicycles to a forbidden place, break in, find the secret tunnel that leads to the pirate cave, discover the hidden treasure, use it to spring dad from foreclosure and save the town -- all while being pursued by an evil, greedy family with a violent past.

Brolin can't act now, so why we would expect acting from him then is unlikely; Astin shows glimpses of the reasons we liked him as Rudy and Sam, but that's about it. The adults in this film are irrelevant, which is probably why my 10-year old liked it . . . that and the skulls and skeletons.",1394755200,,1033,4.770949720670391

If your kids don't read that fast, then you won't have a problem with one of the boys talking about sex toys being in the attic - he says it in Spanish, but it is close-captioned on the bottom of the screen.  There is also some other references to sex and some cursing.  So, if you can handle all of that (and fast-forward when appropriate), you can enjoy the rest of the movie.

Not, the film
Love the film grew up watching it (Probably have seen The Goonies 100x)

It's a must have for Film Collectors/ Steelbook Collectors

611261,5,6303212379,"I'm not going to review the movie-it speaks for itself. Plus, if you're spending the extra movie to buy this 25th Anniversary Edition, you've already watched and love the movie.

I'm going to review the 25th Ann. Edition set. The box it comes in is great. The coloring, 3D effects, and the subject matter all work well together. When you open it up to reveal the inside, the map from the movie is shown along with the metal ""skull key"" from the movie. The items all slide out towards the middle of the box. The storyboard cards are interesting to look at and come in a protective envelope. The other two inserts-the magazine replica and the article reprint are kept next to them as well, sandwiched between the game and the movie. The movie is a bit shorter than everything else, so they've put a cardboard insert to keep it from sliding around.

The magazine and article are in fairly small typing, but are fun to look through.

The game itself is kept in a box, then a plastic case and is all shrink wrapped. The cards, game pieces and board are individually shrink wrapped as well. The board is fairly heavy duty. I'd say it's made just like a normal game board, just a bit smaller. Folds out larger than expected-didn't measure but at least 12x18. It's big enough to easily play and sturdy enough you're not going to need to be super careful with it either.

The movie is a BR. The one negative is that they don't include the DVD as well-as this is the Anniversary Edition, it'd be nice to have both. I was able to insert my old DVD and call it a day, though.

If you're a big fan of the movie-this edition is the way to go!",1384819200,,1628,4.342105263157895

611536,5,6303212379,"Suspenseful music builds, as light from the flashlights of dangerous and angry pursuers grows brighter from the underground tunnel. The last Goonie is yet to cross the monstrous log connecting the tunnel containing the pursuers to the tunnel that will provide an escape. With the intimidating body of murky water underneath the log, the followers growing closer, and the yells from the other five Goonies to hurry up getting louder, the pressured Goonie thinks on his feet (literally). Staying true to his role as the inventive one of the bunch, Data uses his slick shoes to cover the logs service he has already made past with a slippery tar-like substance. Action music now takes the place of the suspenseful music as Data makes it to the safe tunnel with the others in time for the three fugitives behind the flashlights to appear and fall right into the trap, allowing the Goonies to make their escape! This scene is one of many exciting scenes that makes The Goonies fun to watch.
The 1985 American adventure-comedy, directed by Richard Donner, is almost thirty years old and still manages to be a crowd favorite. The majority of todays popular films such as The Hangover, Olympus Has Fallen, Silver Linings Playbook, Twilight, and many others, are centered on drugs, alcohol, world issues, mental problems, or science fiction. Todays movies take millions of dollars to produce mind-blowing five-star scenery, sound effects, and cast. They are very focused on detail and accuracy, which may sometimes become overwhelming. The Goonies, on the other hand, is very refreshing from these overwhelming movies. Although it only took half of what todays movies take to create, The Goonies enjoyable story line makes it five-star worthy. It is very simple and easy to follow.
 The Goonies are a group of friends living in a neighborhood known as the ""Goon Docks."" Unfortunately, their houses are being foreclosed due to an expanding country club. It is their last weekend together and while searching through the attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and a map with a pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Seeing this as the only opportunity to save their houses and childhoods, the Goonies head out to take one last adventure in hopes of finding the famous pirate One-Eyed Willies treasure. After a rocky start, the Goonies are on their way. With nasty villains in their pursuit, they travel through the complex underground pathways maneuvering through One-Eyed Willies booby-traps and desperately trying to beat the clock of foreclosure.
 This movie is enjoyable for all age groups. Although it is clearly a fantasy story, adults are able to relive some childhood memories. It takes them to the days they were young kids going on adventures with friends. Its pirate treasure theme appeals to kids and teenagers, capturing their interest for the duration of the movie. The movie is rated PG, however, due to some foul language used, it is not recommended for children under the age of eleven.
 One key attribute to the movies popularity is the characters. Each character is likeable in a unique way. The motley crew consists of adventurous Mikey, wise guy Mouth, food lover Chunk, and gadget inventor Data. Viewers are able to identify with these kids and feel as though they are on the journey with them. They want to protect them, they laugh at their jokes, and cheer when they have a brilliant plan. The characters pull each viewer into the treasure hunt with them.
 The sets for each scene are incredibly ornate. They vary from a creepy abandoned restaurant, to musty stone tunnels, to immense waterfalls, to bone pianos and collapsing floors. The fascinating part of it all is that these sights are all within an every day town in Oregon. Therefore, the viewer gets an aspect of the everyday world as well as the fantasy world.
 This adventure movie continues to prevail almost thirty years after it was created because it still connects to people today. Situations that occur in the movie, such as foreclosure, are common. In todays poor economy many people lose their homes. Therefore many people can emotionally connect to the characters and feel a sense of hope throughout the journey.
 Along with personal situations, the film also connects with personal relationships. The bond within the close-knit group of young boys is what would today be known as a bromance. The boys have such a diverse group of friends, it makes it comical to watch them interact.  They joke around almost the same way boys joke around in todays generation. The love-hate relationship between Mikey and Brand is also seen amongst siblings today. They joke around with each other, and beat up on each other, but will always look out and care for each other.
 Although the dialog for the movie was created in the eighties, humor is humor.  One of the most comical dances still commonly joked about is Chunks truffle shuffle. People also still make harmless jokes with their friends just as the boys messed with Data for his extravagant gadgets or Brand for his obsession with bodybuilding. These simple jokes and dances are appreciated by viewers and are quoted and reenacted whenever the movie is brought up. Some humor never gets old. In order to understand the Goonie jokes, one must watch the movie.
 The Goonies is a time machine that takes adults back to their childhood. It not only allows them to go back and relive some joys and thrills of senseless adventure, it allows them to bring their own children of this generation with them for the ride as well. The film teaches important lessons on relationships, hard times, and humor. It also provides a bond between two very different generations. Big differences are seen in the 80s generation and todays generation. The Goonies allows the two to sit down and genuinely enjoy a movie that will forever be a classic.",1382486400,,5875,4.931243680485339

611558,5,6303212379,"Written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus, and directed by Richard Donner who is widely known for the Lethal Weapon series, The Goonies was released June 7, 1985. The story follows a group of kids who call themselves ""The Goonies"" through an adventure to try and save their neighborhood that is being foreclosed and turned into a golf course. Mikey, played by Sean Astin known for his star roles in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, is the unofficial leader of the group that starts him and his friends on a quest to obtain the riches of an infamous pirate known as One-eyed Willie. With only one day left for Mikey's father to come up with the money to save the neighborhood, the Goonies are losing hope and decide to scavenge what they can from the attic and discover the treasure map of One-eyed Willie and decide to go on one last adventure and search for the rich stuff. Mikey's older brother Brand, played by Josh Brolin known for his part in No Country for Old Men and the 2010 version of Wall Street, tries to stop Mikey from continuing this endeavor but is tied in when the group crosses paths with a family of outlaws known as the Fratellis, Anne Ramsey as the mom and her two sons played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano. When the Fratellis learn of the treasure, it turns into a foot race for the treasure with deadly consequences if the Goonies can't find a way to come out on top. This is an adventure comedy that is a must see. The story addresses the difficulties of being a teenager and shows how a group of kids with different background and personalities can work together to overcome the obstacles placed before and beat the odds. The Goonies is a good family film to watch that will keep you entertained with the variety of themes and characters displayed.",1382400000,,1789,4.507692307692308

It's a fun little ride, beware there are some elements in the movie that are probably not suited for kids ages 11 and under. But that all depends on your child and how you choose to parent. The elements I speak of are language from a few of the kids, a kissing scene, and one of the characters is disfigured which I guess to some can be scary.",1381881600,,505,4.163265306122449

611785,5,6303212379,"The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score: 300 of 300!!  Wahoo - a perfect score :]  Good stuff for sure - at the time of this review only a small handful of movies can boast they got a perfect Bowling for Movies Score - The Big Lebowski, Popeye, and A Clockwork Orange.  A prestigious honor (if I do say so myself) and an incredibly small list considering the hundreds of movies I've seen.

But wait - what is this whole Bowling For Movies score anyway (you may very well be asking yourself)?  Well, let me tell you ladies and jellyspoons, I watch movies - LOTS and LOTS of movies.  In a typical week I can watch a dozen or more movies.  I own hundreds of movies - some are 3D, some Blu Rays, many DVDs, heck - I even own a few streaming on Amazon.  It occurred to me that my great love of movies (and collecting) has resulted in a unique problem - I had no way of knowing which were my favorites and then a brain-flower was born which blossomed into Bowling for Movies - just an average dude's way of ranking movies using a scoring system which literally has NOTHING to do with bowling!  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea.  I know what you're likely thinking - what a great use of quasi/pseudo-science!  And I'd agree :]

Ok, Movie Dude - if its so great what's it about??
Set in and about the Oregonian coastal town of Astoria, a group of pre-teen rejects (The Goonies) set out on the adventure of a lifetime to find the fabled treasure of the dread pirate One-Eyed Willie in order to save their homes which are slated for repossession and destruction to make way for a golf course.  Lead by the iron-willed asthmatic Mickey Walsh (a young Sean Astin) and armed with a treasure map the band of misfit friends brave subterranean labyrinths, dangerous booby traps, and hardcore, despicable criminals in their bid for all that shiny swag.

Wonderfully shot, creatively crafted - The Goonies is a true gem of an 80's movie.  To top the entire movie experience off the flick features a top notch soundtrack with some of the decade's most memorable artists such as Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon,  and The Bangles.  This movie was more than Goon-enough for me when I was 14 and now that I'm 42 it's even better as I share the Goonies experience with my little Goonies (Little Miss Movie Dude).

What went right:
< > Um, like everything - great story, great cinematography, great jokes, great adventure... what can I tell you - it's just a wonderful time.

What went wrong:
< > Um, like nothing - great movie for kids, teens, or simply the young at heart.

Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1380844800,,3275,4.343185550082102

We were going to Astoria and Cannon beach where the movie was filmed at so I wanted to get them excited about pirates and such, of course I have seen the movie many times and knew they would like it.

Jeff Cohen deserves a special Oscar for his portrayal of Chunk. Definitely the performance of a lifetime.

612119,2,6303212379,"I've never posted a review on Amazon before, but I had to say something on this one. I was maybe 22 or 23 when this movie came out, but I never saw it (nor really knew too much about it for that matter). Finally, at 49-years-old, and after reading all the hype about The Goonies, a couple night ago I sat down and watched it with my wife (who loves this movie). Well, I was stunned! I couldn't believe how bad this movie was . . . I couldn't see past the ""cuteness"" - it was just plain STUPID!; not to mention annoying at times. The little fat kid ""Chunk"" was so annoying for the first 30 minutes or so of the film, that it was all I could do not to get up and leave the room. I normally like adventure movies and can usually suspend my disbelief in order to digest a movie for what it's supposed to be; but from an adult's perspective, ""The Goonies"" is a real turkey. Yes, it would probably be enjoyable for ages 6 to 12 (although there's probably inappropriate content for ages 6 to 10, so that really doesn't leave too much of a viable audience).

Just for comparison's sake, a couple months ago I also watched ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (a film from the same era) for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I also love ""The Sandlot"", and ""Holes"" was pretty good too from what I remember.",1379116800,,1293,4.213709677419355

Watching it as a dad, now, with my 11 and 9 year olds - it held up wonderfully, but I forgot how much cursing the kids did, and the adult double entendres had completely gone over my head when I was younger! My kids giggled at the kids cursing, knowing that is verboten by kids, and were scared at the right times, relieved and happy for them at the end.

Just about everything was done exactly right; the casting was perfect, the acting was great, the comedy was hilarious but not overdone, the script and directing and even the music choices were all spot on. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, and all kids. Yes, there are a few swear words used and some typical young teen ""boy"" humor, but I wouldn't consider that a problem for child viewers. Believe me, they hear way worse listening to the real life teens and adults in this world.

This movie is about friendship and hope in the face of disaster. It's about optimism and the power of determination and courage, regardless of age. It encourages us to believe that nothing is impossible, the miracles can happen, and that fortune favors the bold. An all around feel-good family friendly and funny movie that still, after all these years, counts among my top 5 favorite movies ever. Want to remember what it was like to be a kid?

612352,3,6303212379,"The 25th Anniversary of Goonies is a hard release to judge. It comes with a board game, movie storyboards, a magazine and an article with cast photos. That is an impressive amount of stuff. The picture and audio quality are fairly good. Oddly, the bonus content on the disc is less than 30 minutes (which was ported over from the 2001 DVD). It also contains an audio commentary. On the one hand it is loaded with goodies but the lack of video supplements is disappointing. The longest featurette is only 13 minutes and that's a music video. ""The Making of the Goonies"" documentary is only 7 minutes long. Ultimately, this is a set for diehard fans only since Goonies is now available separately on Blu-ray without the board game. Overall I rate the film 4 stars and this set gets 3 stars. The 25th Anniversary Edition has been able to hold its value.

Special Features:
Cast commentary with director and all seven actors
The Making of the Goonies documentary
Cyndi Lauper music video ""The Goonies 'R Good Enough""
Outtakes
Includes new board game, original movie storyboard reproductions, 1985 souvenir magazine reprint, and reprint of 2009 Empire Magazine article with cast photos and updates",1378252800,,1192,4.87192118226601

I almost bought the house the movie was filmed in, in 2002. The house was sold and turned into a bed and breakfast for a little while. I go to Astoria, Oregon for all of the movie get togethers. I'm about as hardcore of a Gonnie fan as you can get. I find it very sad that so many of the cast that made this a childhood classic, have passed away. Sloth, Mama Fratelli, Mickey's dad and recently the maid are the main characters that have passed on. Yes, I do know everyones real name, but, for the sake of the movie, I won't list them. On a final note, I'm the absolute worst person to watch this movie with, because I have to say all of the lines right before the actors do.

""Sure, right before they ate him!""
The Goonies has to be one of the funniest kid flicks ever made, brimming with wacky observations and withering denouncements.  ""There's a funny farm somewhere and it's got your names written all over it!""
Who hasn't wanted to find a treasure map that leads to an exciting quest?  Here's a movie that appeals to every generation with that very premise.  Danger, thrills, a mad dash below ground through passages laced with booby traps that have already taken the life of a `missing' treasure hunter leaving him mere bones.  ""He's dead for sure!""  Throw in a dysfunction family of counterfeiters (complete with a body in their freezer) and you have the right incentive to stay well out in front of what quickly escalates from a simple treasure hunt to a fight for their very lives.  Throw in some bats for good measure plus an unscrupulous land grabber and you have the makings of a classic misadventure.  Starring the mother of any year, Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.  ""I only dropped you once.  Well.  Maybe twice.""  Her feuding sons are played with relish by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano (clearly, they have issues).  The cast of kids are exceptional.

Warning: there is some language that I wish was not included, some silly efforts at teenage kissing, and a dead body that keeps falling in the arms of the children, but in fairness, nothing outside the realm of a well-rounded pirates story.  We discussed the film afterwards with our son, and actually enjoyed the ""learning moments.""  If you are extremely protective of your children, this may not be the film for you.

The visual quality is awesome for a movie almost 30 years old. I think it's the cleanest version ever, Some scenes I now see stuff that I couldn't ever see on the old VHS. I grew up watching this movie, and God willing, I will let my Kids do the same. I basically, also got this because the Digital versions always has a problem skipping frames.

This movie does stand the test of time.  It is a fun adventure.  The kind we all wished we could have had when we were kids.  The filming location in Oregon depicts the lush lands of the Pacific Northwest and sets a great starting point for the burgeoning young adults on a mission to save their homes.  The young actors do a good job of making their characters three dimensional and the adult actors (particularly the Fratellis) really round out the ensemble.  You may even recognize the main character Mikey as Sean Astin from The Lord of the Rings films or Rudy and Josh Brolin from No Country for Old Men.  This is a great one for family movie night.  One note, that though the film is rated PG, there is a quick slip of language at one point in the film and some younger children might find one of the characters a little scary.",1369440000,,993,4.382513661202186

It goes without being said that they have grown up together and have been best friends since the moment they met.  Along for the ride is the older brother of the ringleader, Mike, his romantic interest and her friend.  The main four, Mike, Data, Chunk, and Mouth are adventurous, smart, and full of childish curiosity that brings them to Mikey's attic where they find the tale of One Eyed Willy and his hidden treasure.  The adventure that follows is in pursuit of that treasure, which also gets them entangled with known murderers, the Fratelli's and their gentle, if not different, brother Sloth.

The tale is ripe with booby traps, pirate tales, gunshots, hilarity, and adventure that is now considered a timeless classic.  It's about friendship, loyalty, respect, the abolition of greed and judgment, and about the importance of family, life, and love.  You can easily watch this film as a kid and well into adulthood with relish and excitement.  To me, personally, it's an instant spirit-lifter and reminds me of a time when the world was full of adventures around every corner!",1366675200,,1284,4.88479262672811

614413,5,6303212379,"I love this movie with a passion! Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton (and all of the child actors, really) all bring their A-game to make this a perfect treasure-hunt-meets-coming-of-age film.  Director Richard Donner, writer-producer Stephen Spielberg, and screenwriter Chris Columbus all came together to create a true classic full of memorable scenes, quotable quotes, and phenomenal acting on all parts--adults and their child co-stars.

Sadly, the initial driving point of the plot (kids going on a treasure hunt to prevent their homes from being foreclosed) is all too familiar to kids these days, who will relate to the desire to find purportedly mythical treasure to keep their homes and neighborhoods safe.

The only thing I would caution parents about is the language (lots of ""s***"" and some inappropriate things said in espaol)  and scary situations, which I believe would earn The Goonies a PG-13 rating if it were to be released today.",1365811200,,957,5.235294117647059

614677,5,6303212379,"""The Goonies"" has everything--drama and comedy--that will appeal to everyone--child and adult. The performances by Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, et al., are as professional as those by the adult actors, and that is much to director Donner's credit. In the extras on the dvd, the now-grown actors comfortably and with a good deal of comeraderie discuss their experiences making the film. This bond must have been there three decades ago for Donner to have elicited such performances from the kids. As you can tell, for me, the pleasure of ""The Goonies"" is watching a group of child actors enjoy themselves as they perform.

The other 800+ reviews will tell you about the plot which I won't mention. Well, okay, that's not entirely true. There are individual scenes that will forever be with me: Chunk's confession, Data's entry into the film, the body in the freezer, etc. The parts are as good as the whole, and that's a rare achievement.

Beside the commentary by the actors and Donner, the Cyndi Lauper videos are a hoot. Nice quality in a nice package.",1362096000,,1050,4.8277777777777775

615120,5,6303212379,Movie was in perfect shape and as advertised.  It is a classic that we will never get tired of !!!!,1356912000,,99,3.95
615121,3,6303212379,"I've seen several films shot in Astoria, Oregon, since this one, and yet whenever I go there, I never find the picturesque qualities seen in the films!

I had not seen ""The Goonies"" since it came out, and had confused it---due to the title, with some other film. (""Gremlins"", maybe?).  I'd think of it from time to time, and thus it stayed fresh in my mind; so imagine my ""shock"" to realize how old it was.  I mean, Dated.  Like a Shirley Temple film.  ""You Are Here"" says the galaxy map of time and space, and it's 1985.  That isn't necessarily a good thing, unless you like the 'eighties, and a lot of people do---as States Evidence I point to the fact that this film has its own website fan group.

For the Record, this Astoria, in Oregon, is on the West Coast.  The movie starts off rather shakily with manic over-acting on the part of the kids, with half of them playing adult, Jersey Shore roles.  The girls in particular, when they show up, are right out of Big Hair East Coast 'Eighties (watch ""Moonstruck"") something I never saw when I was passing through this area, regularly, in the day.  But Hollywood has deep Astoria, NY connections so I understand.

In any case, within 30 minutes or so, the cast settles down and the story takes off.  From this point on, it's a pretty entertaining film.  Of course, times have changed and today the film seems like the basis for a Disneyland theme ride that never was, probably thanks to the ""Raiders..."" movies that produced one that is.  But the sets, especially inside the cliff, are quite imaginative and visually appealing.  The bad guys are bad enough, but still funny.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say it has a happy ending----only a clod couldn't figure that out.  But it was the very-very ending that I didn't like when I saw it, and saying what that was would be a spoiler, and probably why I never saw it again---the very last part could have been done better.

Given that this is a Family Film, we have to note the abundant foul language.  By this point, Spielberg had come to be seen as the Modern Disney, producing saccharine sweet stories heavily tinted with nostalgia, and to protect himself from associations with the post-Walt, Disney crap that Eisner was just beginning to wrench that studio out of, Spielberg decided to use foul language and sexual references by kids to give a realistic edge.  A stupid and utterly unnecessary decision, especially given the lens of time.

What's amusing is the Product Placement, which was just taking off---along with Corporate Naming, having been ushered in by the 1984 Olympics, Los Angeles--which made them profitable for the first time in decades, but left us with a legacy of baseball parks and theaters named for Corporations.  Here it's fairly tame, a couple of Pepsi cans and a Pizza Hut box too obviously ""placed"" in the frame.

Some folks can't leave their youth behind---you see them at state fairs dancing to 1970s Disco hits with their kids, mindless of the often blatant sexual references;  those folks book DIsney cruises to Disney Parks and Disney Islands, and join ""The Goonies"" and ""The Christmas Story"" fan clubs.  Good for them.  It is not a disease, it certainly isn't contageous.  You can watch this film without catching it.  And, if the kids you know keep insisting you watch one of their miserable cartoons or films that you've seen over and over again, this might be old enough that they aren't aware of it, which would allow you to watch something with them that they will probably enjoy, without having to fear cramps and muscle aches from ninety minutes in permanent cringe mode.

Go for it!",1356912000,,3630,4.654631083202512
615122,5,6303212379,"I am a sucker for older movies, and this was a great buy that I couldn't pass up. Cheap price and the product came very fast! The movie was sealed and not scratched. Could not have got a better deal anywhere else.",1356912000,,213,4.095238095238095

The Goonies is an amazing movie!",1356739200,,457,4.6875
615126,5,6303212379,"This film kept me entertained and enthralled on several levels. The archetypal adventure storyline that included the map and ""keys"" to unlock the location of the ""treasure"" was engaging. The ""adventurers"" were on a ""quest"" of a lifetime to save their way of life. The frailest character turned out to be the strongest. The perspective of ""time"" and whose ""time"" it was continues to ring true. The interwoven humor along with the tension of ""the chase"" of the ""bad guys"" kept me cheering for the ""good guys"" throughout the film. Good triumphed over evil, the boy won the girl's heart, and the outcasts accepted another outcast and taught us to look beyond physical appearances to the ""heart"" of a person. The cinematography was inspiring. Well done!",1356652800,,748,4.944444444444445

Next time we will plan ahead and visit our local store and buy one and watch it on the tv. Plus the movie was a wide screen style and we couldn't figure how to get it as full screen. If we wanted to listen to a movie we would have bought a book on cd! If you can fix it to show full screen and fix the dark screen we mite rent a one that shows up brighter.

A great movie for kids as the humor is dorky kid stuff and nothing vulgar or really offensive, my 6 year old has been watching this for years.

I don't think this movie will ever loose it's popularity.

Another great one is,Eight Below. It's based on a true story. Probably not suitable for little ones. One scene about the leopard seal is scary. Even when you know it's coming next,the music and the scene will grab your attention. Fast forward the scene.

I wish more movies got this kind of treatment for their Blu-Ray release, Ghostbusters, Big Trouble In Little China and Die Hard really should have gotten this kind of treatment. The box for the 25th anniversary of The Goonies is great, the inside cover has the map to the treasure of One Eyed Willie, there is a board game it comes with, a press release kit recreation that was shrunk down and some other goodies. The overall presentation of this is stellar. They really couldn't have done a better job. I have heard some complaints about the transfer but I think it looks borderline immaculate. There is no DNR, not too many soft edges, no muddy images, it looks sharp and crisp and retains a lot of the original film grain. There's a decent amount of special features and I am really glad I got this, it's well worth the price. If you grew up with this movie and are a fan, you need this. Thankfully they still haven't made a sequel to this like they have talked about. Sequels suck folks, If you don't believe me, look at what those Hollywood Dougs did with Ghostbusters, because Ghostbusters 2 is one of the worst sequels ever. It completely undermines the first film (which is a modern masterpiece of cinema) and isn't a good movie in any way, shape or form. I just hope they don't try and squeeze more money out of the Goonies by making some crappy, forced sequel. This movie is one of the best ever made, they won't ever make a better kids movie that plays up the magic that all kids movies should have without going too overboard.

I waited to get this for a while because, let's be real, $50 in my opinion is a bit much to spend on a single movie, even a cool set like this.  However, waiting paid off because I wound up scoring it brand new down the road for only $30.  Not bad.

Shut up!

I honestly cannot fathom the universal adoration that the masses have for The Goonies. It's one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. Only the Von Trap children and the brats Spielberg cast as the Lost Boys in Hook have irritated me more than The Goonies (with the exception of Chunk). Before I get into the movie I'll give you a run down of the cast.

Sean Astin as Mikey: seems as if he is phonetically reading off cue cards (a-la Peanuts) rather than fully understanding what he is saying.

Josh Brolin as Brand: a constant damper on the adventure as he does nothing but attempt to diffuse the fun with his constant 'grown-up' perspective.

Short Round as Data: so lovable in Temple of Doom, in the space of one year he managed to become the most annoying characters in movie history. Very little he says can be understood. His inventions are cartoonish, out of place, contribute nothing, and spoil many scenes. Whenever he opens his mouth I just want to grit my teeth down to the gums.

Corey Feldman as Mouth: would be tolerable if he stopped screaming so much. This applies to the whole cast, but especially Mouth. Is better when he's serious instead of sarcastic, which isn't often unfortunately.

Kerri Green as Andy: again, she would be bearable is she just shut up. Her random petrified rant about looking after her body is completely un-called-for and spoils the scene.

Martha Plimpton as Stef: likable, but doesn't have much to do or serve any purpose.

Jeff Cohen as Chunk: adorable, and the best (and youngest) actor of the bunch by far. Cohen's talent is infectious and it's a shame that the rest of the child cast undo his effort. In the scene where he confesses his previous misbehavior you can see that Robert Davi is loving it and cannot hold in his laughter.

John Matuszak as Sloth: also adorable, but his ""Hey, you guys"" moment spoils everything.

The Goonies was the second of three films in a row that Chris Columbus wrote for Amblin. If it had the shades of darkness and horror of Gremlins before it, or Young Sherlock Holmes after it, then it may well have been a true classic. Richard Donner (a loud, monstrous director who I really like) even used darkness to great effect in Scrooged a few years later, but here he seems to be really distracted by the fact that he's laughing at the antics off-camera and unable to see that, as a finished film, it's not as funny as he thinks it is. I mean what teenage kid, in the 80s, played with marbles or pretended to be James Bond? He directs these kids as if they were 7 or 8 instead of 13-ish. A film depicting more realistic teenagers would have won me over right away.

The titular gang themselves live in Astoria, Oregon and are failing to enjoy their last weekend together before the rich folks tear down their houses to build a golf course. That is until Mikey suddenly remembers the treasure map up in the loft. So off they go to find the treasure of pirate captain One-Eyed Willie against the wishes of downer big brother Brand. They soon discover that the entrance to the subterranean world where Willie lies waiting begins underneath an abandoned restaurant used as a hideout by the Fratelli crime family. They only just barely manage to sneak into tunnels without being noticed, leaving Chunk behind to have his own sideshow adventure. Once inside the tunnels they encounter a gauntlet of traps set by Willie to prevent anyone getting his loot.

Sound good right? And it would be if handled by a different director, or was scored by someone other than Dave Gruisin, who turns in a fully generic effort with no standout themes or melodies. Silvestri and Goldsmith were very busy in 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice. I fully believe that Columbus' script was worthy, as I have read the novelization and it's far superior to the film, but for above listed reasons it doesn't work for me as a film.

A lot of The Goonies has been rudely forced into pop-culture too. How exactly is 'The Truffle Shuffle' funny? Why do people fondly remember this? It's...nothing. Why do people always quote Sloth's ""Hey, you guys!"" as if it's hilarious. It isn't. It is absolutely not funny at all. By the end Donner allows the action to become campy and farcical, disrespecting the story and pathos. There are moments towards the climax where I honestly feel like switching the movie off.

Stick with the novelization, and be thankful a sequel was never made.

One year after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, now you may ask why that's so important, because steven spielberg thought that Temple of Doom was too violent.

My kids loved it, and even played the game that came with it. We took sorry out of game nights and added the goonied board game. I am very satistfied with my purchase.

Pros:  Very decent HD picture.  Some scenes pretty grainy, some scenes super crisp in Blu, good for an old film.

Cons:  Some digital artifacts through out that the average joe might not ever notice, making me wonder if the film masters were really rescanned to achieve the purest HD and just over compressed in the single disc version... it does not appear to be an upconversion of the old dvd source materials like the first release of the Stargate Blu-Ray that was panned.  On the other hand, film grain is natural in filmography, or on purpose like in the apollo 13 blu disc to achieve the vintage look.  It also appears on various scenes that some of the optics in the filmography was a bit odd, being focused in the center but distorted at a certain radius.

I still remember how upset I was when I discovered that my sister had taped over the copy of the movie I had recorded when it was on TV. And, while growing up, we didn't have the kind of money to just go out and buy a copy of it on VHS. But now I'm all grow'd up, and I can buy it for myself, on Blu-ray, no less.

This 25th Anniversary edition is a bit much. I guess I didn't really look at what was included in this product before it arrived, but suffice it to say, all I really needed was the movie. This thing comes in a pretty big box, with a number of items I will probably never use (such as the board game?!?).

Imagine my surprise when I got a huge box (beautiful & solidly made) with a mini magazine (that is actually interesting), a ""Where are they now?"" pamphlet, story boards (with corresponding photos from the movie, and a board game (I'll probably never even open), all for less than $20. Of course the day after I get it & watch it, Amazon posts for the pre-release of the disc-only version I would have bought (still happy with my purchase).

The only thing that matters to me is the video & sound quality (not perfect, but some of the best for its age), but the rest will be a great bonus for collectors that love that kind of stuff. At least it stores everything in a box that looks good on my DVD shelf. It's a little over-sized, so it may not fit upright on shelves with little clearance over regular DVDs.

If you like the Goonies, you should get this Blu-ray as it's never looked better. If you like all the collectibles, you'll hate missing out on this set.

My favorite bonus on the disc is the Cindy Lauper music video. I love when the 'cliff-hanger' mentions MTV. For those too young to remember, the M used to mean 'Music' before it became ' Moronic-reality-shows'",1316131200,10,1380,4.48605577689243

616151,1,6303212379,"First of all, let me say that I love The Goonies movie. This review is not about the movie.

The copy of the movie that is being offered here is not a Region 1 (USA) copy. It is a Region 2 (Europe) copy. It is not a 1080p version of the movie either, which is easy enough to see when you view it. There weren't any previews, copyright protection notices, chapters or any menus on the disc either. Once the movie starts to play it can only be paused, stopped, fast forwarded or rewound, no skipping to the next chapter (it wasn't encoded with chapters). This disc doesn't have any extras, menus, commentaries or anything.

I have lived all over the world and have movies from all over the world in my collection. However, this copy looks and feels like an illegal copy that you can pick up for a couple of dollars at any Southeast Asia Electronics market. If this is an illegal copy, it would be the first Blu-ray copy that I have seen; maybe the bootleg market has caught up to Blu-ray already, but I hope not. The ""shrink wrap"" on this movie was not a factory shrink wrap either, again, it was the type of wrapping you find on illegal bootleg copies; it looks like its sealed by a peel and stick type of wrapper.

As a comparison, I watched my DVD version, up-converted by my BD Player. The DVD version was of a higher quality and I had all of the menus and chapters.

In short, don't be scammed by this bad bootleg copy.",1297987200,9,1422,4.275092936802974

I think the movie has held up well even though 26 years have gone by since it first came out.  Yes, there are some dated parts of the movie: hair styles, clothes, glasses, bicycles - but overall this is a movie that even in another 26 years, young and old will still enjoy.

There is big business vs. small property owner; escaped convicts; young love; bullies; friendship; treasure hunting; pirates; a giant; puzzles to figure out; brotherly competition; and good winning out over evil.  These are all pretty timeless themes.

These young actors got a good start in this movie.  Most have gone on to much bigger things. Sean Astin - Samwise Gamgee in the Lord of the Rings trilogy plus many other roles in movies; Josh Brolin - many distinguished roles on TV and movies including ""No Country For Old Men"", ""Milk"", and the remake of ""True Grit""; Jeff Cohen became an entertainment attorney with his own law firm in Beverly Hills; Corey Feldman continued acting on TV, movies, and stage, also is involved in music and is an environmental activist; Kerri Green continued acting on TV and movies, co-founded a movie production company and writes screenplays; Jonathan Ke Quan has continued acting on TV and movies and has worked as a stunt choreographer; Martha Plimpton has been nominated for an Emmy and three Tonys, has continued acting on TV (I still remember the amazing episode of Law and Order: SVU she received the Emmy nomination for and she is currently starring in the FOX sitcom ""Raising Hope""), in movies, in plays,she sings and is considered to be one of the hardest working actors in show business.  With this talented bunch of young talent, is it any wonder that ""The Goonies"" is still standing the test of time and keeping us entertained? Plus Steven Spielberg wrote the story.  Talk about a no-brainer.

One note - John Matuszak, ex-NFL Oakland Raiders football player that played ""Sloth"" in the movie, died in 1989 at 38 years old of heart failure caused by drugs and possibly pneumonia.  Tooz lived hard and partied hard but he'll live on in this movie as the scary looking but loving Sloth, friend to Chunk and the rest of the Goonies.",1294876800,,2424,4.720379146919432
616244,4,6303212379,"Aside from being one of my personal favorite movies of all time, this blu ray box set adds to the awesomeness that is The Goonies! The classic movie comes boxed with some really cool stuff so I'll discuss each item.

The Goonies [Blu Ray] - Picture quality is amazing. Looks just as good as newer movies shot with HD cameras. None of that weird grainy looking snow that sometimes shows up (all depends on the film stock used in production). The sound isn't too shabby either. I don't notice a huge improvement with the audio from the dvd version, however it seems a little cleaner.

The Goonies Board Game - Haven't played it but I opened the pieces and studied the rules a bit. Seems like a fun to-do on a rainy day kind of game.

Empire Magazine 2oth Anniversary Article - Nifty little reprint simply updating what the original cast has been up to since the film was made.

The Goonies Souvenir Magazine - 150 pages telling the story of how the movie was made, cast profiles, and lots of other fun stuff.

Storyboards - Original Story board mini copies. Pretty neat to compare the boards to what eventually would come to screen.

My only gripe is that the Blu Ray itself really has no new bonus features from that of the DVD. However, this set is a must have for any collection.",1294444800,20,1280,4.448717948717949

616285,5,6303212379,"As with all others from my generation of 80's kids, I Love this movie. This is one of THE most iconic films for both teens and younger kids, and I can only imagine that it will be clear and amazing on Bul-ray. Additionally, all these bonus goodies are fantastic for die-hard collectors, but not really necessary if you simply wish to just let the movie serve as all the awesomeness you need. The one thing I aboslutely must discredit this release for, even in spite of giving it 5 stars (solely for the movie and bonus features, as they are the same as the 2001 release), is the lame cover picture. First off, why is it that studios feel the need to change the original artwork that served as the Theatrical Release poster!? DVD releases make these cheesy cover pictures thinking they are fresh and new marketable ideas that are going to work at selling the movie. Well newsflash, this movie has a cult following (myself included) that will love the movie no matter what, but would prefer that it at least show a picture of the cast. The 2001 release wasn't a drastic deviation of the formula used for the original, but this cover is cheesy and I hate it.

Lastly, what would make this release really bitchin', is to include the out-of-print soundtrack. Seems like a no brainer, even if you omit a few songs, just include the best songs. I own the soundtrack personally (actually I own 3, they're still available and cheap in Japan), but I'd like to see other fans get that little something extra instead of a board game many are unlikely to play.

You had your blanket it was dark you had your friends over watching the film made you yourself go on an adventure.  Why anyone would give this film anything below a 4 star rating is beyond me.

I don't have to tell you the story line of this film because chances are you saw it already if not then you must be somewhere under 27 or 28 because this film was really for the late 20 early 30's individual before surround sound, and HD was even considered as a movie format.

616312,5,6303212379,"It's incredibly hard to believe, but I seriously think a couple days ago was actually the very first time I ever watched the Goonies. Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.

Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.

As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.

Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.

This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.

616336,2,6303212379,"I heard great things about this movie, so when I finally saw this I was glad I didn't see in the theater. In fact, I didn't miss anything. The story is predictable and the kids chatter so much it was annoying. The adult villains, as usual, are comic caricatures that nobody could possibly be afraid of. No attempt is made to reflect the reality of real kids' lives, and everything, from the Sloth creature to the treasure hunt, is so rooted in fantasyland that you don't believe that any of it could happen in real life. In other words, the film is nothing more than an amusement park ride or a Rube Goldberg project (which it shows again and again). It operates on a purely superficial level - you suspend disbelief and have to ignore all the ridiculous things in it too make it work.

I felt many scenes were forced - all the kids' expressions didn't seem natural, but fake, everything was ""on cue""; their laughter or fearful expressions didn't seem inspired or spontaenous. I believe the curse words were put there in a desperate attempt to make the kids sound real, but they just sounded Hollywoodized.

In comparison, take a look at the Disney live action kids films of the 70s, like ""Candleshoe"" and ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" Fewer special effects, a bit dated, no curse words, but genuinely moving as well as exciting and the kids were always believable. As it was, this film left me cold. I think the Chinese kid's bag of gadgets represents what this film is all about - a bunch of gags and tricks, but after the magic act's over, you're bored and want to go home.",1276992000,2,1574,4.519298245614035

616380,5,6303212379,"What makes this movie so great is not only the great stories, but the lovable and believable characters.

The story starts actually quite sad in that some friends are going to have to leave their homes, which of course also means leaving each other. We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.

Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)

They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.

Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: ""That's right.""

An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: ""I'm starting to like this kid.""

While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.

It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure. Why? Because it's ""The Goonies!""",1260921600,,2158,4.660526315789474

Now that over 20 years have gone by and my boys are grown, I occasionally watch it on DVD and in retrospect, I am a little surprised at some of the lines. I know this film is a cult movie and it probably deserves it, but really didn't see the need for some of the language, like ""Oh Sh-t"" from Chunk, and so on.

My kids really enjoyed this film and wound up being ""influenced"" by the flick in a few ways.  My wife and I bought a pirates map on fake parchment for them which we had framed and placed in their room which we called a Goonies Map.  For a period, my younger boy was interested in pirates, pirate ships and coins, and the family even wound up staying at Pirates Cove (a hotel which featured a full size pirates ship) on a trip indirectly because of this darn film.

That being said, when I screen this old movie with subtitles on I am surprised at some of the things the Goonies say in the course of the entertaining racket. Just an observation, that's all. All in all, a great film and I would still vote it five full stars.",1248825600,,1167,4.08296943231441

616574,4,6303212379,"Combining swashbuckling, mystery, murder, pre-teen wonder and teen angst, ""The Goonies,"" is a wonderful film about two brothers and their friends who are about to lose their homes but wind up on an amazing journey that just might save them all.  When the Walsh brothers and their friends find a map in the family attic, the ""Goonies"" set out on one last adventure before having to say goodbye to each other.

What they find is a trail leading to the treasure of the infamous One-Eyed Willie, a pirate who literally protected his gold to his death.  The gang has to get past a number of booby traps, including a piano of death, in order to get Willie's treasure.  They also have to deal with a rich high school bully and the murderous Fratelli family.

This film is fun from the beginning.  Steven Spielberg story and Chris Columbus' screenplay fit well on the screen.  Director Richard Donner blends humor, adventure, and a touch of romance into the tale that prevents the story from ever getting boring.  Cyndi Lauper's ""The Goonies R' Good Enough"" sets the musical tone for the film.

The cast features a number of (at the time) up-and-coming actors.  Sean Astin plays the younger Walsh son, Mikey.  Josh Brolin plays Brandon Walsh.  Indie princess Martha Plimpton plays Stef Steinbrenner.  Future fight choreographer (and also ""Short Round"" in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") Ke Huy Quan plays Data.  Jeff Cohen portrays Chunk.  Kerri Green plays Andy Carmichael and future ""Two Coreys"" star Corey Feldman rounds out the Goonies as Mouth.

The Fratelli clan is filled with the wonderful Anne Ramsey as Ma Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis, Robert Davi as Jake and John Matuszak as the legendary Sloth.

Be warned that their is quite a bit of strong language in this film.  It pre-dates the PG-13 era, and probably would have received that rating if it had been around.  The rest of the tale is family friendly, with only mild peril and one murder.

Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.

The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?

Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqu humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.
The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.

The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.

Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family.

I figured he may be a little too young, but sometimes, for my own sake, I need to put on something different than the usual cast of cartoons. Within the first five minutes of the film, I thought I was in trouble when Chunk drops the S-H bomb, and my three year old instantly repeated it. At which point his mother yelled from the other room...  ""did he just say...?""  I quickly dodged that bullet though, and, am pleased to say, that the kid really dug the film.  As for me, I find this film to be as enjoyable now, as I ever have. I don't really know why for sure, but I always feel like I did the first time around (was probably seven or eight) digging this cool adventure, where little Mikey gets to make out with Andi. Oh yeah Andi. She could be part of my group of Goonies anyday...I'd be like ""F*** this inhaler!""
The bonus features also include the two part video from Cyndi Lauper, which is absolutely a treat, ...even for the kids. It has a few of Cyndis wrestling buddies, Captain Lou, Roddy Piper, and Andre The Giant, as well as a few other familiar faces, in a fun, two part serial, Cyndi Lauper type twist on the Goonies story. Which, probably could have developed into a popular Saturday Morning cartoon if you ask me... Pretty cool.  I recommend this, again, for a good family viewing... just explain to your kids if they are real young, that Sloth is a good guy, and be sure to cuff the ears when Chunk spills his ICEE during the opening credits...

Unfortunately three ghastly criminals Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also after the treasure.

One of the 80's most beloved adventure movies! Director Richard Donner whom made such classics like ""Superman 1 & 2"", ""The Omen"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" and executive producer Steven Spielburg has created a hilarious and entertaining flick for everyone to enjoy. The film co-stars the beautiful Kerri Green as hottie Andi, John Matsuzak as Sloth the lovable  deformed man and Josh Brolin as Brand, Mike's big tough brother and the acting especially by the kids are very well done.

I'm not sure that kind of gratuitous language is ever appropriate, but definitely not for the PG crowd. I wish filmmakers didn't think 4-letter words and adult themes were appropriate in kids' movies. Filmmakers must live in a different world than most Americans do.

I had to have it when I discovered it included a commentary featuring all of the Goonies with the director. I begged and pleaded with my parents to get a DVD player so I could see it, and finally, my wish was granted.

How could I be disappointed? The movie is fabulous. It is an adventure story and a teen movie mixed into one; it covers the coming of age theme and finding buried treasure at the same time. I know what you're thinking: ""Rubies, and emeralds... and diamonds?"" Yes! A group of kids who call themselve ""The Goonies"" are facing their last days in Astoria, Oregon. Their homes are being taken from them by a rich family who wants to extend their country club over the properties. Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin) are brooding in their home when Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Ke Huy Quan) drop by. In their boredom, they decide to explore Mikey's dad's attic where he keeps all of the rejected museum items. There, they find a map showing where the kids can find pirate One Eyed Willie's buried treasure on the coast. Fueled by boredom and a need for money, the kids set out to find it. Brand tries to stop the boys, but consents to go along on the adventure when they meet up with Andie (Kerri Green) and Steph (Martha Plimpton). However, they run into trouble when they find that the place where the treasure is buried is also the hideout of the Fratellis, a group of murderous criminals. Filled with great scenes and great lines, (""I smell ice cream,"" ""That's my mom's most favorite piece,"" ""I'm setting booty traps!"") you'll find yourself quoting this film and talking about it with everyone. It appeals to young and old alike.

The extra features are great. Besides the commentary which adds a lot of insight into the hijinx behind the scenes, there are both parts of the Cindi Lauper ""Goonies R Good Enough"" music video, a short featurette with behind the scenes information, and three deleted scenes including the famed octopus scene. Even the main menu is beautifully done.

This movie has a intelligent storyline and great writing.  The acting and the directing are not bad, at all.

I mean Speilberg, Donner and Chris Columbus. I mean the cream of the incessant crop.

""Goonies"" is quintessential Speilberg. When a film, not in the era of CGI, and computer animated everything, can just grip you with an amazing score, a slew of talented kids, and a storyline that is gripping, flowing and totally fun, you feel so great about yourself over and over again. I can be down in the dumps to the extreme, and throw Goonies in, and it takes my through a rough day with smiles and enticing childlike splendor.

How many of us wanted to be part of that group? How many of us dreamt, in those wee hours, before slept crept in, when we saw Goonies for the first time, or the 90th time, and dreamt such amazing things: to find hidden treasure, to climb down wells and discover hidden caves, to dig through canals and taverns in our backyards and find our own One Eyed Willie, eye mattey, ehhhhhh, yes, the magic of the Gonnies so transformed my youth and brought me to that magical place of make believe, which only the brilliance of Speilberg can do producing. Pirates of the Carribean doesn't touch Goonies for sentimentality or the like.

I will never forget seeing this when I was 9 or 10 or so, and getting all red with my mother when they kiss in the dark. I was learning about life then, and Goonies certainly helped me realize the wonderous things I was to look forward to.

Not to mention that the character actress Anne Ramsey is impeccably sinister and perfect in her role as Mom Fratelli.

One of my favorite films in the world as a child, and totally up there even by today's standards.

Chunk, Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, and the hilarious performance by Corey Feldman.

The movie is a great concept. The actors do a reasonable job. It paces o.k. The sets were good to very good.

The problems that make it average? Richard Donner's direction was average (it all seemed too cropped), the cinematography was poor, especially given the potential of the sets, the editing abysmal, and the sound/dialog was crap. If you're going to tell the story via action and dialog versus paced exposition, you might want the dialog to be front and center in the sound mix. When half the dialog is garbled, and no exposition, you're lost pretty quick, and the events that follow make little or no sense.

In all the production was second rate considering the involvement of Donner and Spielberg. Basically what could have been a movie on the scale of a Back to the Future sunk to B-movie level. It was only saved by the story itself, and reasonably good acting. As it stands, I like the idea much more than the execution.",1177286400,3,1049,4.481675392670157

Best I've seen and he shows it with this which is one of his best along with Jaws, ET, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indian Jones, Jurassic Park, and much much more of his best. I don't know. His movies of today are kind of becoming a little bit of a blunder, like War of the Worlds, and The Terminal. But they were great at some scenes, but still they're not his best. Steven might be going a little downhill with his movies, because probably he's running low on ideas and most of them have already been done. But, PLEASE!!! Everyone Do not attempt to remake any of his classics. They are meant to be done once and be the best forever. Like if Jaws is done again it will be a load of garbage. I know it!!!

Anyway this movie is great!! I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to relive the retro 80's and for anyone especially who grew up on this movie and hasn't seen it for such a long time. Watch it!! It will bring you back to the 80's. FLASHBACK!!!",1177113600,,1087,4.2009569377990434

No Comparison!!.  I've read some of the other reviews and they're all pretty good, so I'll just add some personal trivia.  The house in the movie is in Astoria, Oregon. Thats the same town where they filmed Kindergarden Cops. Some of the scenes on the beach were near Haystack rock in the Cannon Beach, Oregon neighborhood. When Chunk says he saw the Jeep full of bullet holes and calls it an ORV, that was the slang (off road vehicle) before not so off road products were named SUV's.  Reminiscent of The Little Rascals that Spielberg watched when he was in  school, it's an appealing adventure story, a sort of 'Young, Young, Indiana Jones plot"". Amazing how Steven Spielberg went from filming a color  silent film of 1965 senior sneak day at Saratoga High School in California to blockbuster mega-mogul film Director, producer et al.  Part of his success was in thinking big.  Although Goonies did not appeal to a broad age group, he didn't cut any corners, spending money on blowing up boats and creating a giant octopus, scenes that hit the cutting room floor.

A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts.  The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail.  The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).

First, I read some other reviewers reviews of this movie and they don't explain something. What happend to that guys face? It made me sad that the mean lady was mean to him on the boat just because his face is different than hers. She is an ugly, mean lady.

My favorite parts are about the camera belt and the oily shoes that squirt oil on the log. How come I wish i had some of those so I could use them on my little sister when she is anoying me.

It's easy to see why this film has become a ""Cult Classic"" amongst Gen X-ers and Y-ers: it's entertaining on many levels.  While it still feels distinctly like an 80's film, it definitely has withstood the test of time.  A group of children are placed in a situation whereby they encounter a variety of ""grown-up"" experiences and have to adapt.  Humorous and awkward situations unfold, and the story stays compelling throughout.  I still enjoy this film as much as I did when I was a kid, and have gone out of my way to see it at midnight showings downtown, etc.  The commentary and other features are nice bonuses, and make the DVD all the more worthy of adding to your collection.

I remember loving this movie as a kid, and as an adult, well, some things never change!  I can still quote most lines from this movie, and although that annoys some people, other people love to quote it right back at me.  The Goonies is an adventure from the get-go and it keeps you rooting for the Goonies the entire time while hating the Fratelli's.  Donner and Spielberg have created a timeless movie with all of the pure 80's goodness.  Let's face it: the hair, the outfits, the music, the sayings.  It's all outdated.  But the story and characters are timeless, and the movie is bursting with energy.  Sean Astin is gold in this movie, and I was glad to see him get his career back on track after The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  And can I say that I had the biggest crush on Kerri Green?!  Wow!  She was great in ""Lucas"" as well.  Corey Feldman, is well, he's Corey Feldman, and he's extremely annoying in the DVD commentary (so much so that his constant interrupting sends Sean Astin to leave and not come back!).  Chunk does a great Truffle Shuffle and other characters round out this wildly entertaining adventure.  And there are funny little mistakes in the movie (like Sean Astin calling Josh Brolin ""Josh"" instead of by his character's name ""Brand"" when they are in the basement), but the deleted scenes help answer some of those mistakes (like the octopus being scary).  Watching the deleted scenes makes you feel like it was the right decision that they were deleted because most of them DID NOT look good!  I am actually pretty happy that there never was a sequel as I think it probably wouldn't have been that good and that our expectations would be too high, and ultimately, all of us who loved the original would have been disappointed.  And I do agree that this movie is actually more like a PG-13 movie.  Too much unnecessary language that shouldn't have been there in the first place.",1152576000,3,2008,4.530555555555556

""Data has a backpack with a lot of things""

There is some foul language, but nothing that hasn't been overheard by little ears before.

Oh, and of course a great adventure too!

If you grew up in the 90's or are still in the process now, the movie of course still has all those things, but it's a little dated and not quite as ""glamorous"" and flashy as many movies made today. (But as another reviewer noted, I do believe it holds up pretty well, better than many 80's movies.) Still, it is partly with this in mind that I give it only 4 stars.

The other reason for ""4"" instead of ""5"" is the inappropriacy of the PG rating. Even as a pre-teen at the time I thought the scene with the nude statue on which a certain piece breaks off and the boys glue it on upside down was too much--I remember being pretty embarrassed sitting next to adult friends in the theater!

Miracle of miracles, as well as in an effort to save their home, the Goonies discover a treasure map and decide to go off looking for pirate treasure rumored to be burried in the town.

This is ridiculous, as we all know, but to believe in hope and crave adventure brought us together for this wonderful children's classic.  The humor is silly and insulting, the way kids are.  This was just before the politically correct 90s, where we would not be allowed to use fat jokes (Chunk's truffle shuffle), making fun of the physically or mentally disabled (the disfigured Sloth being locked in the basement by his ashamed family), or racial sterotypes (Data).

Bringing back the original cast to comment on it together made it a truly wonderful experience, as those kids are all about my age, and I lived it once again through their eyes.

617262,5,6303212379,"Brainchild of cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is a thrilling fantasy adventure film for younger audiences - although adults will find it enjoyable as well. Foreshadowing the success of the Harry Potter films, The Goonies involves a series of tests and obstacles that a group of young kids must overcome in order to save the day. In a lot of ways, the film is like an Indiana Jones for kids - produced in such a way that kids can envision or fantasize about being in just such a situation.

The film follows the exploits of a neighborhood group of kids who call themselves The Goonies. Upset that they will soon have to part ways because of the forced commercial development of their neighborhood, the kids are enjoying what they believe will be one of their last meetings together.

But while Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, and Data (the nicknames of the Goonies respectively) are exploring Mikey's attic, they find a treasure map hidden in the back of an old picture frame. Purportedly, the map leads to the long lost treasure of the famous pirate ""One-Eyed"" Willy. Banding together with Mikey's older brother Brandon and two neighborhood girls, Andy and Stef, the group sets out to uncover the pirate's vast riches and thus save their homes from the wrath of the wrecking ball.

But a small problem stands in their way. The treasure map's starting point rests underneath an old abandoned house used as a hideout by the notorious Fratelli crime family. Brothers Jake and Francis, coupled with their deformed yet gentle brother and mean Mama Fratelli, are quite an intimidating force. When the Goonies manage to uncover the entrance to the cave that harbors their treasure, Chunk is left behind. The Fratelli's viciously interrogate the boy in an effort to find out what happened to his friends. But it takes a freak accident (spilled water falling down the hole in the fireplace) before they find One-Eyed Willy's secret passage.

With the Fratelli family hot on their heals, the Goonies must pass through a series of mental and physical obstacles set up centuries before by pirates intent on keeping undesirables away from their precious bounty. Interspersed in the action is a number of clever and humorous one-liners that add to the overall audience enjoyment of the film.

In the end, the kids discover One-Eyed Willy's monstrous treasure. But can they stave off the greedy ambitions of the Fratelli family? Will they manage to save their neighborhood with the newfound treasure? You'll have to watch to find out, and trust me, this movie is a lot of fun...

Each of the stars contributes to the film in his own way. Chunk provides many moments of comic relief with his endless whining, and Data's constant deployment of quirky homemade inventions, although stretching the limits of reality, are a welcome addition to a fantasy adventure film tailored for a young audience.

With the introduction of The Goonies DVD, an entirely new generation can discover the thrill and wonder of this instant cinema classic. Given its wide range of appeal to audiences of all ages and the exciting quest for hidden treasure, The Goonies passes the test as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, or even worse - if your children have been deprived of seeing it - then I highly recommend renting this one...

Having an adventure with your best friends that includes treasure, being chased by bad guys, avoiding the booby traps, and all the while having a massive blast. The Goonies is wickedly fun, includes all the above mentioned, and more. The story is built around such solid characters, characters that you see yourself in, your friends in, your family in. These everyday people are thrust into a wild adventure.

Mikey (Sean Astin-- look at how little he is!!) and his brother Bran (Josh Brolin) live in Astoria, where their house is being forclosed on by men who want to build a country club over it. Mikey dreams of finding a buried treasure, ""rich stuff,"" to save his house and the houses of all his friends, who are also being forclosed on. His father works in a museum and has kept priceless artifacts in the attic, where Mikey, Bran, and their gaggle of friends find a treasure map. Mikey can't resist. He has to find this treasure and find out if the stories his father told him about the legendary pirate One Eyed Willy are true.

Joining Mikey are his hilarious friends-- Chunk, a clutsy eating machine; Mouth, the joking talker; and Data, the inventor. Andy the cheerleader and her friend Steph tag along too, mostly so Andy can schmooze with Bran. And of course, they are being chased by three inept, money hungry criminals. It's such a whirlwind adventure, so much fun, an Indiana Jones flick of sorts. There aren't that many great adventure films. This is one of the top ones of all time.",1110758400,3,1548,4.645985401459854

617266,5,6303212379,"It is hard to predict how this movie will play to somebody who has never seen it, given that it's twenty years old now.  Because I grew up watching this movie, I can only see it through those eyes.  If you aren't familiar with the movie already, all I can say is at least go rent it.  If you are familiar with the movie, I highly recommend this DVD.

I had only seen this movie in the chopped-up Pan-n-Scan format, and seeing the complete film in all its Widescreen glory is great.  The picture quality is amazing compared to my VHS copy recorded off HBO!  :)  Of course the sound is great, too.

The extras list indicates ""Outtakes"", which are really Deleted Scenes.  I wanted to clarify this because sometimes they use the word ""outtakes"" to refer to Bloopers/Gag Reel.  These Deleted Scenes were very interesting to see.  There's one that's several minutes long and involves the gang stopping by a convenience store and being harrassed by Troy's bunch.  It was also great to finally get to see the octopus scene I had heard so much about.  Fun stuff!

I did not remember the Cyndi Lauper music video, but if you remember it I'm sure this will hold some nostalgic value for you.  Otherwise, it's probably something you will only watch once.

The ""making of"" documentary is not new...it was produced around the time of the film's release.  There are some slow spots where the plot is explained for people who haven't seen the movie.  However, there was quite a bit of behind the scenes footage, and the impromptu interviews with Richard Donner and the cast are fun to watch.

The best of the extras is the VIDEO commentary with Donner and the gang.  Corey Feldman is really annoying, but if you can stomach his antics, the commentary is really enjoyable.  The group has a good comradery and it's great to hear them reminiscing about the film.  Best of all, you get to SEE them doing the commentary.  It's great to see what the cast looks like fifteen years later.  This is a GREAT feature that I wish more DVDs included.

Donner; the man responsible for ""The Omen"", ""Maverick"", ""Scrooged"", ""Conspiracy Theory"", ""Superman: The Movie"", and the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies; put together a movie here that's great fun to watch, even twenty years later.  Again, if you like the movie, I highly recommend the DVD.  If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?",1104451200,3,2358,4.605769230769231
617267,5,6303212379,"The Goonies.. What can I say? The Goonies was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid. It had everything - adventure, danger, treasure, cool gizmos, and bumbling bad guys. This, in my books, is the best kids adventure movie ever made. What's more, it is still great to watch as an adult - there are numerous gags that would just go straight over the heads of kids that now make so much more sense.

The Goondocks, in Astoria, are being demolished to make way for a golf course and resort. A local bunch of kids, who have affectionately named themselves The Goonies, are not taking the news too kindly as this is their favourite place in the whole wide world. On a rainy day before the Goondocks were due to be demolished Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Johnathon Ke Quan) are bumming around the Walsh house feeling very depressed. On a whim they decide to go rummaging through the attic, out-of-bounds to all mind you, and 'stumble' across an ancient treasure map and doubloon depicting the whereabouts of One-Eyed Willie and his treasure.

Needless to say The Goonies see this as a great adventure, not to mention a chance to pay off foreclosing banks! Along the way they get mixed up with the Fratellis, some of the most bumbling 'evil' criminals ever to grace the silver screen. Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) is the matriach with a firm controlling hand on Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano). Boy, is Ma one scary lady! The Goonies also come across Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). These two join the swelling ranks of The Goonies and help wend their way through the caves and booby traps laid by One-Eyed Willie centuries ago.

Throw into this movie mix the enigmatic, and gigantically huge, Sloth (John Matuszak), booby traps, high adventure, a blender, a few bats, an octopus (almost!), incredible treasure, a one-eyed pirate, falling boulders, the most amazing waterslide, a few skeletons, and a buccaneer fight aboard an ancient pirate sloop - what more do you want?

This is a great movie, especially for the ones that, like me, had their childhood at the 80's. If you like CGI-based movies like Harry Potter, then this movie is not for you. ""The Goonies"" relies on real acting (like Sloth, I love Chunk). I think it is very well-succeeded in trying to create a childhood atmosphere.  The music also helps to create that atmosphere.

The two things that I didn't like on this DVD is some rough editing towards the end of the movie, which I didn't remember and the commentary feature, featuring a very sarcastic Corey Feldman. I don't know how Donner let this stay on the DVD.",1102636800,3,833,4.437908496732026

Dumb luck?

Wonderful adventure of a bunch of middle school kids in search of pirate treasure, the pirate being One-Eyed Willy. They did this since their home was to be destroyed by greedy land developers who wants to build a golf course. The kids solve many puzzles and avoid mobsters (one of the Fratellis was played by Anne Ramsey, who two years later starred with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal on Throw Momma From the Train) as they reach the treasure.

Honestly, what 10 year old wouldn't want to be a Goonie, running around your neighborhood looking for lost treasure and trying to escape from the Fratelli gang who are after you and your treasure?

This DVD is a pretty good one when it comes to feaurettes and extras. There is an outtake montage scene which is  not nearly long enough but that is a negative I find on a lot of DVDs. The Cyndi Lauper music video could have definitely been left out but the extra scenes and the commentary more than make up for it.

This is a rare look at the early career of Sean Astin as well, who has gone on to star in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Being on a set with a bunch of other kids with that great pirate ship and waterfall to go down, who wouldn't.

What follows is a movie filled with spills, chills, chases, action, awesome set pieces and obstacles, and plenty of humor. All very predictable, and all very fun. Think The Little Rascals in the world of Indiana Jones and you have the right idea.
Take note before buying this for kids: Some of the humor from the 80s is probably more risqu&eacute; than would be expected. This would probably get a PG-13 were it released today. The kids joke about sexuality and drugs in a way that many might be surprised about. Parents with small children, proceed with caution. That said, the movie remains kid friendly enough that it should be fine for most kids over 10.
This DVD looks very good; while not state-of-the-art, it is an improvement over the VHS versions that have kicked around for years. Great sound, good picture. All very nice.
The extras really stand out here. We have a Making Of documentary that covers all the bases, with plenty of on set footage and interviews. Informative and well done. An array of deleted scenes was surprisingly good - some of this footage is excellent - though not complete. Finally, the DVD commentary brings the cast back together for a very funny gathering as they swap stories from way back when. Good viewing for longtime fans.

Those Extras:
Commentary:  Good, if perhaps a little too crowded.  You have Donner along with all of the kids, and the presentation is a bit odd as well:  every now and then the film shrinks and the cast appears in a small box as they make their comments.  Fun to see them all grown up, but it's a bit chaotic, with Feldman fancying himself a comedian (at one point calling himself Corey HAIM), and He Quan utters maybe ten words through the whole thing.
Deleted Scenes:  A number to choose from, but only for rabid fans looking for ANYTHING new to savor.  Otherwise needless moments that deserved to be axed.
Behind the Scenes:  Nice featurette of on-set antics is fun.
Music Video:  Cyndi Lw-ah-puh's silly contribution to the film features nothing from the film but wrestlers(??) and other nonsense instead.

617674,5,6303212379,"Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg team up to bring us ""The Goonies."" The Goonies are a group of kids that love to go on crazy adventures and have a ""never say die"" attitude. They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary ""One-Eyed"" Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot.
Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially ""One - Eyed"" Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and ""truffle shuffle"" will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.
The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre.
The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general.

From about the age of 7 until around 13, I was always on the lookout, on some rainy day, for a lost magical amulet or eerie looking cave. And in many ways, I still am.  I hate to get political with this, but I think that many Americans have this kind of feeling snuffed out of them once they get past 25 or so.

617727,5,6303212379,"The first thing I was thinking when ""Goonies"" really kicked into gear was: This is the daydream of an adventure-loving preadolescent boy, full of pirates, bloodthirsty villains, and exotic twists and turns in an underground maze full of booby traps. It's sort of ""Indiana Jones"" for the kids as well as the adults.
The Goonies (a band of young boys) are spending their last weekend hanging around their hometown, before it's razed for yuppie developers. Then Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) uncovers a treasure map hidden in an old painting, and becomes obsessed with finding the lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willie. With that treasure, they could save their town.
But the hunt for treasure sends the Goonies, Mikey's long-suffering teenage brother (Josh Brolin), and a pair of teenage girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) into dangerous proximity to the murderous fugitives, the Fratellis. With the Fratellis on their tail, the Goonies are determinedly navigating the underground, booby-trap-infested tunnels that lead to the treasure -- or to a very nasty demise.
The stolidly mature among you may scoff at the improbability of the story, but who cares? This is obviously a fantasy story, harkening back to pirate treasure and childhood adventures, thwarting the evil guys. The classic formulae are what makes it so fun. ""Goonies"" is like ""Indiana Jones"" in the sense that it's action-filled, with nasty villains, elaborate booby-traps, and a plotline that is wonderfully improbable. This is just fun. The sets are amazingly complex, full of stone tunnels and enormous waterfalls full of money, thin little bridges and a bone piano that causes the floor to collapse.
Sean Astin (yes, this is THAT Sean Astin, the guy currently starring as Samwise Gamgee in ""Lord of the Rings"") is endearing and very convincing as Mikey, the gutsy boy that could. Josh Brolin is also good as his overbearing but nice brother; the other Goonies include the incredibly funny Corey Feldman as ""Mouth"" (the scene where he weirds out the cleaning lady is priceless), comic relief Jeff Cohen as ""Chunk"" who bumbles from one misadventure to another, and Jonathan Ke Quan (who was also in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") as gadget-obsessed ""Data,"" a kid riddled all over with homemade inventions that occasionally save the heroes' behinds.
Though this film was made in the 1980s, it's aged extremely well -- now there is affection on top of the original liking for it. It's a funny, entertaining thrillride with pirates, villains, treasure and a band of quirky heroes. Great fun.",1045440000,55,2568,5.102137767220903

And I still want that Purple Rain shirt(lol).We follow the adventures of Mikey,Brand,Mouth,Data,Stef,Andy and who could forget Chunk. NO ONE!!! It's one of Richard Donner's best films I think his first best will be and forever will be Superman. When I heard that this awesome classic was going to DVD,I ran out of the house to buy it,even though I did have it on video,DVD is way better. I wished they had more outtakes on it but I loved the DVD.But they have other cool stuff on the DVD,The making of the Goonies,Commmentary,The Goonies R Good Enough music video and theatrical trailer. Didn't we all want to move down to Astoria,Oregon after seeing this?I know I did,just so I could find that [great] waterslide. I hope like E.T.,that they bring back The Goonies to theaters for it's 20 anniversary,if they do,I'll be one happy kid to see my favourite kids movie in the theater for the first time.

617800,4,6303212379,"Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !

All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).
Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!
Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.
Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!
Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!

617801,5,6303212379,"Like any true child of the 80's, the Goonies holds a special place in my heart.  It's a rare person of a certain age who wouldn't immediately know what you were talking about if you said the words ""One Eyed Willie"" to them.
In these days of CGI special effects, increasing violence, and sadly, decreasing innocence in children, a film like The Goonies is a real gem.  It's a classic Good-versus-Evil yarn, where even the Evil isn't really all that bad.  And what's more, it showed us that a bunch of goofy kids like us could take on big business & organised crime, and win.
In the Goonies we join Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk and Co. on an adventure to find the lost treasure of the pirate One Eyed Willie, which, bless 'em, they want so that they can rescue their home town from being razed to the ground by greedy developers.  This film is more or less an Indiana Jones for kids, with some brilliant ""booby twaps"" and many genuinely funny moments.
This DVD isn't avilable in Region 2 encoding until Septemer (2002), and I'm just short of marking off the days on my calendar til it's released.",1029715200,,1091,4.467336683417085
617802,4,6303212379,"This is a very funny movie.  However, the language is inappropriate for younger kids.  We don't watch it anymore because there is a two year old in the house and he repeats everything.  In a few years, when he is older, it will be like having a new movie again.",1028764800,5,261,4.18
617873,4,6303212379,"Great movie, and nice of the studio to invite all the kids back for a commentary.  But what in the world happened to Sean Astin during the commentary?  He just up and left.  Because he's now in Lord O' The Rings, everyone else isn't 'good enough' for his company?  Can anyone clarify?",1028419200,,284,4.403846153846154
617874,4,6303212379,"Richard Donner's madcap kids adventure was a big hit in it's own little way back in the 80s, and it's not hard to see why. It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on ""screaming"" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.
The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the ""Goonies"". And of course Dave Grusin's memorable theme tune. THE GOONIES is one of those cute little films that Hollywood should do more often.",1028419200,,1389,4.56
617875,4,6303212379,"Really I should know better than to enjoy this film that was so obviously made with kids in mind. Yet there was something about this film that I couldn't help but respond to. Maybe it was the fact that I, like the kids in this film grew up in a northwest climate during the eightees. Or maybe it was the fact that I too dreamed of pirates and finding buried treasure as a kid.
Anyway, I really did enjoy watching this film. It has suspenseful moments, exciting action sequences, and incredible sets. The kids were all quite likable, indeed I remember kids like the goonies while I was growing up. I think all of us have met people like Chunk at some point, a worrisome, glutinous, but good natured kid. Steven Spielberg wrote the story for this film, and his influence can certainly be felt throughout. Interestingly, the climax of the film foreshadows Spielberg's ""Hook"" which he would make a few years later. I guess making that film was always at the back of his mind.  Richard Donner was the director.  Donner also directed ""Superman"" and adds an amusing little reference to that film.
The DVD is well worth purchasing as it allows the film to be shown in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The Goonies was shot as a widescreen film, as a result the pan & scan VHS cuts out a lot of the image making it difficult to see what is going on.",1027555200,,1344,4.459349593495935

617877,3,6303212379,"I love the Goonies because it is a great movie. But one thing I really hated about the DVD was the fact that not all the deleted scenes are on it. Everyone says they are most likely lost but then again you see them turn up on Disney and all the bootlegs in good quality. Also for all you fans out there, the snack and shop scene is not the full thing. It stops right in the middle of Brand yelling at Mikey. On Disney and the bootlegs it shows Mouth steal the map from Brand's pocket again and then the kids run off. So all in all, the DVD isn't all that great. The only good thing is pretty much the commentary.",1027123200,25,612,3.983739837398374

It is a mini movie about 15 minutes long and not included in her Video collection DVD.  It has all the old wrestlers like Captain Lou Albano , Andre the Giant, Iron Sheak, and Roudy Rod Piper.  It is very comical ond you see her personality break out.  Besides the hard to find video.  I was surpised to see a great movie which everyone knows is a classic.  Also included is a second version of the movie with the cast talking over it and saying funny comments abou tthe movie as they made it. Nice to see what they look like now.

617880,5,6303212379,"Like a lot of Eightie's kids I grew up watching The Goonies. There's so much nostalgia in it for me. One summer I watched this movie every other day, it seems. It was on the Disney Channel, and my parents taped it, and get this: it had the deleted scenes, in their proper placement! When I heard other Goonies fans talk about the deleted octopus scene and convenience store scene, I was confused, because I always saw the movie with them in it. Weird, huh? In fact, who decided to take them out?
Anyway, there's no denying that this movie is still funny and adventure-filled without seeming too out-dated. Don't let the 1985 date fool you: it's as good and fun as the Indiana Jones movies. The special effects look great, even without fancy computer animation. Kids will stay entertained with its fast-paced story, and those of us that are older will appreciate lines like: ""'1632, is that a date or something?' 'No, it's your top score on Pole Position.'"" and the irony of ""Mikey, I'm gonna hit you so hard, when you wake up, your clothes will be outta style!"" Maybe the clothes really will be back in style someday.
The DVD release promises to be perfect for every true Goonies fan. It Includes commentary by the whole cast, those deleted scenes, and Cyndi Lauper's music video. If you're interested in a movie with good character dynamics, a Steven Spielberg story, and something that's appropriate for the whole family, you should already own this movie. If not, I'm telling you, this is first-rate family entertainment. You won't be dissappointed.",1024876800,,1552,4.7518518518518515

Wouldn't it be cool if you could find some way to stop it? You decide to look for a treasure.  You look with your friends so that you will all be able to find the gold and stay together.  This is the main plot of ""The Goonies""
 ""The Goonies"" was a great movie.  It had a simply great plot that will blow you away.  There were quite a few funny parts.  There were some amazing obstacles and you didn't know if the boys would get away past them.  The action was incredibly tense.  The climax was very exciting, and the denouement was a good relief.  The screenwriter did a terrific job with the screenplay.  The cast put a lot of effort into their performances.  Overall, we really enjoyed this movie.
 In spite of our enjoyment, there were some flaws with ""The Goonies"".  We noticed a few small plot holes, but they weren't that bad.  Also, there was inappropriate language, and it just wasn't necessary.  Some of the humor was a little inappropriate, too.  This movie is scary in a bad way because things suddenly jump out at the characters.  We think that children under the age of six should not see ""The Goonies"".
 We recommend ""The Goonies"" for kids and adults who like adventure movies. Even though it has flaws, we think it's a great movie.  We hope you enjoy this movie as much as we did.",1024876800,5,1433,4.3522727272727275

618051,5,6303212379,"Growing up in the 80's - The Goonies was one of the most incredible movies for me. It captures all of the childhood joy and want of adventure and excitement that a normal day just doesn't bring. This movie, while it is clearly an ""80's"" flick, does not appear dated in any way. It still has that spark that gave it life nearly 20 years ago.
That said, here's what you get with this DVD and here's why you should buy it today:
The movie itself is enough however...
The deleted scenes are a lot of fun. We finally get to see the ever-fabled ""Octopus"" scene. For years, I would scratch my head when Data said ""The Octopus was really scary!"" Huh? What Octopus? Well, he's in this DVD. You also realize why the scene was cut out. Let's just say the animatronics weren't all that great.
Those old music videos starring Cyndi Lauper and various classic WWF wrestlers are here too. Remember Rock ""n"" Wrestling? I found myself saying ""oh yeah....I remember that!"" Watch for a cameo of Susanna Hoffs from the Bangles in the video!
The DVD commentary is a lot of fun! While almost every new DVD has a commentary in place, it almost always bores one to tears with the director or a star just kind of droning their way through the movie. Often, the major stars don't even do the commentary (great example is Rocky - where the commentary features everyone but Stallone himself!) This commentary has all of the original Goonie stars plus Richard Donner. There's a lot of joking around and the stories they tell are funny and don't go off the subject. Note: Sean Astin disappears about halfway through the flick. Also, beware Corey Feldman who talk over everyone to further perpetuate that he is the biggest glory hog in show business.
Enough already. This is such a great movie and the special features are ones that you'll actually watch more than once! Buy the DVD already!",1013731200,16,1860,4.555223880597015

I can only imagine how fun this would be watching it for the first time in the theater, must have been incredable for those who got the chance to. The movie is great the film is by the amazing Richard Donner. The story and every thing is done by the amazing Steven Spielberg who has a way with children and looking through the eyes of the adventure. The screen play is written by Chris Columbus! I mean what more can you ask for with those great men in Hollywood? How about an amazing cast just staring out you have the youngsters like Corey Feldmen who plays the loud mouth ""Mouth,"" Sean Astin as the kid who leads them on the journey to save their home town, Josh Brolin who plays the older brother and helps keep them out of trouble and other noticable faces. Not only was this movie full of comedy but it leads to a spectacular adventure we can only dream about as kids. With spectacular senery, and great special effects.
The DVD is amazing buy, the commentary by the entire cast is worth it to buy from but more on that later. The graphic's of the DVD is outstanding. It leads you through a cave like senery like in the movie with voice over's from the cast. The full length Cindy Lauper video that aired on MTV and was a number one hit ""The Goonie's Are Good Enough."" Some cut scene's with the octopus scene, and a scene that was cut out where they are in a 7/11 type store and so on. And a short but sweet Making of the Movie with talk from Richard Donner, some of the cast, and a young Steven himself.
As for the commentary that alone is worth the buy. Everyone showed up. However, Sean Astin for reason's unknown walked out in the middle of the commentary and Richard Donner can't remember half of what had happened during the commentary of his own movie. However, a lot of it was saved by Corey Feldman and  and Martha P. You'll hear interesting tid bits like maybe the hat from Indiana Jones was taken for the movie from the last Steven picture at the time :), The Jackson's hung out around the set, funny and memerable moments from the rest of the cast. It's truly amazing and I have fun watching it over and over. Even though they seem to be stepping over each other a lot it's just really fun to hear what happened during the making it.

This movie has some of the funniest and best lines I have ever heard..and whats even better is watching it on DVD. It looks like new now that it has been digitally enhanced, as well as the sound being enhanced. Its also in widescreen, so you get to see what was probably cut out of the background.

The Cyndi Lauper music video in the 'Special Features' section is hilarious..it was nice to see the video in its entirety (since I never saw the whole thing, lol). Also, the outtakes feature is cool, because you get to see scenes that were originally cut out of the movie. Theres the quicky mart scene, the ever-so-talked-about octopus scene (now we know what Data means about the huge octopus at the end), a small scene with Sloth and Chunk (which they SHOULD HAVE left in, it was soooo funny!!) and theres another outtake that I am probably leaving out, but those are just a few! You can also watch the Commentary (which is kinda boring, but at least you get to see the actors all grown up). Then theres the usual foriegn language settings, and the theatrical trailer. And if you haven't seen this movie before (shame on you! j/k) I hope you enjoy it!! :-)",1009670400,,1537,4.2457337883959045
618130,5,6303212379,I highly reccomand the DVD for anybody who remembers the truffle shuffle.  This is one of the best kids movies of all time because for one thing it doesnt talk down to it's audience the way so many other kids movies do.  It has a fun plot to it as well as Corey Feldman.  I have introduced my niece and my nephews to this movie and they just love even though the movie is nearly twenty years old.  I also loved the extras that came with this DVD as well.  It had the classic Cyndi Lauper music video which is a fun one to watch if you are a wrestling fan.  I also loved the fact that it also show the kids all grown up.  Please purchase this if you are a Goonie just like me.,1009411200,,675,3.9191176470588234
618131,5,6303212379,"This has always been one of my very favorite movies. The DVD is one of the best with its cool 3D option screens. I loved seeing ""The Goonies"" pristine, in surround sound, and--best of all--in widescreen. The extras were fab; especially the hilarious feature-length commentary reuniting all the kids from the film. It was worth the price of the DVD alone. (Although I do wonder why the remarkable Sean Astin disappears halfway through.) It was also cool to see the Cyndi Lauper music video again after all these years. The only thing that really disappointed me was that the three deleted scenes were not added back into the film. You can only view them separately which, quite frankly, bites. What's so strange about ""The Goonies"" deleted scenes is that many years ago, Disney Channel aired the film with all the deletions reinstated! I actually have this version on a video tape and I was hoping the DVD would be the complete film. All in all, an excellent DVD.",1009324800,2,962,4.732142857142857

618134,5,6303212379,"I saw Goonies in the theatre at least 10 times during its initial run. I then watched it on video a few thousand more times. Now, 16 years after first seeing it, I now have the Goonies on DVD, and I must say it is a great disc.
First off the deleted scenes. I have been waiting forever to see the infamous octopus scene. Well it sucked, but only through this great DVD was I able to finally see it. Most of the cut scenes were cut for a reason (they were bad) but it is fun to see them anyways, and some of them fill in some of the gaps found when watching the finished movie.
The great thing about this disc is the commentary. Instead of just a audio commentary with a director and a few actors, the makers of the disc got all the original Goonies, and director Richard Donner, to do a video commentary. So while you watch the movie, you also see all the Goonies, all grown up, talk about the film and have fun while they relive the time they spent together while they were filming it. I just wish Corey ""Mouth"" Feldman could have shut up for at least two seconds during it!
All in all a great DVD for a classic movie. Buy it already! Oh and you get the Cindy Lauper music video too! Where else can you see Captain Lou Albano and the gang these days?",1006300800,3,1251,4.0894308943089435

This movie is one of my favorites. The dvd version is spectacular. There is the commentary, deleted scenes, and the music video! Some how I had seen all the deleted scenes before? I think different channels put on different verions of the movie.
The cast is great especially chunk (Truffle Shuffle). When I was little I would bury stuff in my backyard and make a map and pretend I was in the movie. This movie rises above all others and is Steven Spielberg's best other than Jaws.

618136,5,6303212379,"This movie here is a sterling example of how you can make your imagination come alive and create a world of fun, intrigue, surprise and adventure.
We have 7 likeable kids living in a small community with close ties and lots of history and memories.  Coming along to spoil the show, we have a wealthy land developer with his brat of a son as a sidekick who want to raze the town and turn it into a golf resort.
Not willing to be uprooted from their beloved town, the industrious kids (with the help of a found treasure map and a local pirate legend) stumble upon a passage that could possibly lead them to treasure.
Getting to this point was only half the fun.  Now we're really in for a good time!  Enter the danger, adventure and all out pursuit of treasure.  We follow the 7 youngsters through booby traps, dark caverns, perilous near misses, and exciting exploits that is sure to grab the imagination of adults and children alike.  And all this while being chased by 3 bumbling but quite funny counterfeiters who add a great touch to the plot.
Moving right along, while avoiding all the pitfalls that might trip up most people (but not these young Indian Jones proteges), they discover the ultimate prize in the form of a long hidden Pirate ship located in a lagoon enclosed by a mammoth cave.
Upon searching the ship (and dodging more inventive booby traps to boot), the pirates treasure is found which is a means to an end to pay off the land developer to save the town.
Not so fast!  No easy getaway for these bunch of resourceful and rambunctious little ones.  Along comes those dastardly counterfeiters destined to spoil the show.  A little walking the plank, some sword fighting, and a whole lot of fun and the baddies are put out of business.  The exit from the cave is no walk in the park either being that the cave itself was booby trapped (yep, another booby trap and a good one).  With the help of a lovable monster and a whole lot of strength, the kids leave the cavern as fast as you please.
Believing that upon leaving the cavern that the treasure was lost in the lagoon, alas, we have one of the seven heroes who spirited away several gemstones from the Pirate ship that will save the day for the future of the town!
Now, who do we have to thank for this excellent adventure?  Well, let's first look at one of the executive producers.  Steven Spielberg.  Arguably the best movie director who has ever been associated with the silver screen and motion pictures.  Almost every piece of work that Spielberg has ever done has turned to gold and he is a master of exceptional movie making.
Next, we have director Richard Donner who is behind the blockbuster Lethal Weapon movies and many more greats too numerous to list. He has done an excellent job of making a movie that audiences can count on time and again to enthrall them and make them feel great.
This is absolutely 5 stars of fun and excitement all the way and is a sure winner anytime, anywhere.  Highly recommended all around.  Enjoy!",1005696000,,3008,4.501838235294118
618196,5,6303212379,"It was the summer of 1985. A summer that will leave a life lasting impression on this little 6 year old kid. I went into the theater and saw The Goonies. What a ride. What a summer. I saw it in the theater 2 or times. I would of seen it again if my dad hadn't persuaded me to try another new movie that just came out. A certain Zemeckis movie about a teenage boy who goes back in time and see his parents when they were his age. Like I said, what a summer!. The Goonies is a special and magical film for all those who were lucky enough to witness it in it's original release. How many of us have had our group of childhood friends who would play, pretend, and just be kids?. How many of us would dream and fantasize of being a superhero, or a pirate, or going on great adventures?. Well, with The Goonies, it's all there. It hits close to home for me not just because of the times and how nostalgic it was, but because it spoke to me. I could of been a Goonie. The film follows a group of Oregon kids(The Goonies) who stumble upon an old treasure map leading to the treasure of pirate One Eye Willie. The kids see it as a way of possibly saving their homes from destruction. From then on, our fearless kids begin their search that leads them thru tunnels, face to face with gun toting criminals, and trying to survive deadly booby traps. It's a wonderful adventure for everyone. The cast is phenomenal. From Sean Astin to Corey Feldman to Jeff Cohen, these are real kids. They seem to really be friends. They all have their own quirks and personalities, and the kids are so talented to pull it all off. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and it always sounds genuine and just ""right"". What is also great about the film is that it has an ""edge"" to it. A certain darkness just underneath that doesn't make it 100% squeaky clean. Some curse words and a corpse helping. The bad guys, The Fratellis, are an interesting bunch. Both seriously menacing and cartoonish at the same time. And really, who didn't want a Sloth of their own after seeing the film?. Some people and critics complain that nostalgic kids from the 80's make the movie out to be better than it is. Maybe, but the movie IS good. Sometimes the hype from it's life long fans are justified. This is one of them. It's funny, it's wild, it has engaging and relatable characters, and it's just...magic. The commentary has all the kids and director Richard Donner, and what's great is that the film will go to a box in the corner and actually show the entire cast sitting there watching while they record the commentary. Outstanding!. They all look great too. A vintage 1985 special and a Cyndi Lauper video round out the package. No bones about it, The Goonies is one of those special gems that lives up to it's legacy. I can still watch this movie and feel like I am 6 years old again sitting in the darkened room at North Division Cinemas. Very few films can do that for me. The Goonies will live on.",1005264000,,2957,4.320143884892087

The childish goofiness is funny, Mikey's dreamy optimism is touching, and the adventure the goonies go on is exciting.  The acting is decent for such young kids.  The sets are cool, and the creepy gangsters are both menacing and funny.  The cut-scenes on the DVD aren't that great, though.  It's easy to see why they were cut.  The Cyndi Lauper video is amusing, featuring many 80's wrestling stars.  All in all, a good addition to the collection of any child of the 80's.",1003968000,,651,4.504273504273504

I think the one thing that makes this movie the most memorable is the great music.  Let's get serious, Cyndi Lauper was a poster child for the 80's and even though overall her music bites, it fit perfectly into the movie.  Although the movie does have some of it's cheesy moments, overall it is a good representation of that era.(...)This DVD brings back all of the memories of seeing the movie in the theater, especially with the cutscenes and the unforgetable octopus scene.  The only real disappointment is that Spielberg didn't integrate the cutscenes right into the movie like they did with Superman.  Oh well, it is better than nothing.

618199,5,6303212379,"Part preteen mystery novel, part shiver-me-timbers adventure trek, ""The Goonies"" is a classic example of crowd-pleasing entertainment that needs no logic in order to tell its story. Director Richard Donner seems to have gathered this seek-and-find journey from the childhood fantasies of every child in the world a dozen times over, and the result is pure, unrelenting fun from beginning to end!
The plot is the simplest one imaginable: Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk, a group of friends who call themselves The Goonies, stumble across a centuries-old map of the upper West Coast, near their homes, where there is a treasure believed to be buried somewhere along the shoreline. Despite the disagreement of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, they leave in search of the treasure, in hopes that their newfound riches will save their homes from a greedy developer.
Their hopes are somewhat thwarted when the path to the treasure lands them face-to-face with the Fratellis, a mother-son crime team who begin tracking the kids once they realize that there is money at stake. As they all make their way deeper and deeper into the caverns leading to the pirate ship, they encounter dangers that will keep kids on the edge of their seats.
This is all done with a high level of laughter, lightheartedness, and surprising enjoyment. Each character is given a certain demeanor, different from others. Mikey is crippled by a speech impediment, while Chunk, like his name, is husky and clumsy; Data has a pseudo-James Bond fascination about him, and Mouth is outspoken and crude. All of their personalities combine with hilarious results, a special part of the film's magical charm.
The cast also seems to be having a tremendous amount of fun with the movie. To scrutinize their performances is completely cynical, for their is little that can be criticized. The dialogue is corny from the start, but everyone takes it all in stride, and together, they polish off each moment with comedic joy and humor.
As a child, I enjoyed this movie immensely, and as I look back on it, the adventure was quite suspenseful, due to my age and experience with movies. The journey through the underground caverns, the booby traps, the children at the hands of the not-so-cunning crooks... all of this is pure magic for a kid, without being overly frightening. Now, as an adult, the movie has a much different effect on me, allowing me to recall my childhood fantasies, and the vast enjoyment I had for this film.
""The Goonies"" is a classic adventure that appeals to many, kids and adults alike. It's got a charm and sense of humor that grow on you, and its indulgence in its own corniness is, in its own way, appealing. For those who experienced it as a child, to watch it now is to recapture a pleasurable memory from childhood; for those new to the experience, it recalls your own fantasies and beliefs as a kid, and leaves you smiling with satisfaction.",1002067200,5,2923,4.871485943775101

618203,5,6303212379,"Watching THE GOONIES again today, sixteen years after its initial release, I realize it's not the greatest movie ever made.  The dialogue is sometimes goofy, the jokes are corny, the set pieces are occasionally a little simplistic (come on -- the piano scene?  The waterslide?!?!).  But still, I love THE GOONIES.  I love it!  And as easy as it is to see its flaws, it's even easier to see why it's so much fun...
- The actors.  The cast is enormously appealing, from the incomparable Martha Plimpton to the sweet Kerri Green to the adorably self-deprecating Jeff B. Cohen.  Even Corey Haim -- oops, I mean Feldman -- does a great job.  Plus, Anne Ramsey, Jon Matuszak and on and on and on.  Not a weak link in the whole cast.
- The premise.  GOONIES is perfect escapist fun for kids.  While it's clearly not in the same league as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it tries to be the same kind of stunt-filled adventure movie for a younger audience.  It's great fun for kids, because in this movie, a group of adolescents get to save the day.
And mostly...
- This package.  Clearly a lot of care and love went into making this DVD.  When the entire cast (plus the director) of any film can be reassembled after sixteen years, you know everyone involved has a great fondness in their hearts for the project.  And that fondness is evident on screen.  This DVD has TONS of extras, including one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard (and, in this case, seen!) and some fun outtakes.
If you're at all a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  And, if the internet rumors are to be believed, there's the possibility of a sequel sometime in the future.  What better way to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight GOONIES 2 than to scoop up a copy of this DVD ASAP?  The better this sells, the better our chance of getting more GOONIES.

Okay, we all love The Goonies. If you haven't seen it (what?!), the other 100+ review already written will tell you why you should. Normally I try to write balanced and analytic reviews, but this is THE GOONIES! So here's why the DVD is just so cool...
One. The deleted scenes. Most of us, myself included, wanted to see the long-mooted Octopus scene, referred to by Data but never seen in the film. Well, it's here, along with some other stuff which you should like.
Two. The Cyndi Lauper video. It's nearly 12 minutes long! I never saw it the first time around, and it's the cheesiest, corniest 80s pop video you'll ever see, complete with a few WWF wrestlers of the time (including Rowdy Roddy Piper!) and all of the kids except Kerry Green.
Three. This is the best surprise of the whole lot. The commentary, listed as only featuring director Richard Donner, actually features ALL SEVEN of the kids together. And what's better, we SEE them. The commentary was recorded sometime around February 2001, and the whole thing was filmed. Let me tell you, it is SO cool to see the kids together, all grown up and reflecting on the making of the film with Richard Donner sitting in the middle like 'dad'. It's just great. And they all seem to be as excited as I was (although Sean Astin disappears halfway through for some reason!). But I can't recommend this enough.

One of the magic of this movie is the memory of my childhood years that returns while I was watching it.
As for the DVD itself, you will find loads of extras. There's the MTV, deleted scences, etc. I just love the commentary by the director and the then kid actors who have all grown into fine adults. The commentary will tell you both the fun and hardship the actors went through while shooting Goonies.

THE GOONIES is a wonderful story of a bunch of friends that experience the magical ties and bonds of their friendships.  It is a classic story of good vs. evil, and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful writing it.
A group of friends are out in search of ""One-Eyed"" Willie's hidden treasure in the hopes of stopping a land developer from taking their homes.  Once they find the pirate's map in their attic, the wild fun begins as the group is put through many rigorously challanging tasks in their quest.
The film moves along at a rapid pace, with excellent acting, witty dialogue, and a nice, cohesive storyline that is fun and easy to follow.  You can't help but cheer for the Goonies to succeed in their search.
Besides the entertaining film, the DVD is loaded with some super extras.  A Cyndi Lauper music video, three never-seen-before scenes, and some excellent commentary by some of the actors are just a few of the perks of the DVD.
This movie is nothing but fun, and with the help of a super, colorful cast of actors, THE GOONIES is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a pleasure to watch the magic unfold on the screen.

To top it all off, the cast of mostly then-unknown-now-renown stars succeeds in bringing out the kid in all of this
The DVD is fantastic!  The crowning feature is undoubtedly the cast and director commentary.  This is how commentary was meant to be done!  The screen shows the entire cast along with director Richard Donner sitting at a table with microphones while simultaneously showing the actual movie in the corner of the screen, so you can see both what the actors are commenting about and exactly what their reactions are.

Then, as if by divine intervention, Mike(y) Walsh (Sean Astin) finds a treasure map in his parent's attic, and bands together with his friends, his older brother, and two girls, to find the treasure and save the ""Goondocks.""
  This DVD release was carefully planned and masterminded by someone rather skillfully.  If it hadn't been for those who knew the potential this DVD had for the many loyal fans, we may have been stuck with nothing more than 2 different language subtitles and the theatrical trailer.  This DVD delivers in the realm of several interesting areas:
 1)Audio/Video commentary by the cast: Probably one of the most innovative ways for comentary, as we see and hear Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and even director Richard Donner give their views.  And even with the comentary, Corey Feldman still embodies the spirit of his character ""Mouth"": the fact is that he seems to never shut up throught the entire commentary.  Some interesting articles get covered up in some areas as some people try to say things but give up when someone else intervenes.
  2)""The Goonies R Good Enough"" music video by Cyndi Lauper.  Yep, Cyndi Lauper in all her colored haired glory, this time acting in quite a nutty take as her Mom and Pop's gas station is going to be overtaken by greedy corporate types, until she uncovers a secret cave, where she meets the Goonies, and a number of crazies (pirates, a green-faced witch, etc) all search for an ancient treasure.  Steven Spielberg even makes a brief cameo.
 3)Making of the Goonies-a 7 minute segment on the film, shot back in 1985, very brief, but does show interesting scenes, such as filming inside a ""Snack-shop,"" and a police car chase shot that was omitted.
 4)Outtakes-this title is misleading, as you may think it was the kids flubbing their lines.  Actually, it contains 3 scenes, including the deleted snack-shop sequence, a further dissection of One-Eyed Willy's treasure map, and then the gang's encounter with a giant octopus.
 5)Page layout: the main screen looks like the caverns, and really captures the movie instead of a static image, any direction you go will cause something on the menu to happen.
  Even with 5 stars, there will always be things that we, the fans of the Goonies, will always wish to see.  Talked about on the commentary was the possible fact of an extended police chase, and gorillas getting loose in the film.

618287,5,6303212379,"Despite the appearance of the lackluster cardboard case, The Goonies DVD is a must for any fan of this classic family adventure film. The high points of this edition are an inventive and colorful selection menu, the excellent transfer print of the film used, and the feature-length audio commentary, which reunites the entire child-star cast of the film! They've even gone so far as to include both parts of the promotional Cindy Lauper ""Its Good Enough"" video that ran its course back in the good-old days, when MTV played music videos.
The DVD is far from perfect, however, and there are a few minor disappointments. First, the audio commentary occasional switches from the movie to an in-studio shot of the actors discussing the film, which I personally found a bit distracting, although others may disagree. And while they take great pains to show the cast members talking, there are no filmographies or bios included in the Cast & Crew section, an excellent opportunity for a ""Where Are They Now?"" moment. Finally, while some deleted scenes are included with the extras, the cast invariably makes mention throughout the commentary of numerous scenes filmed that are not shown, even in rough form.

It's Saturday-matinee serial redux; SEE the Goonies escape from Steven Spielberg death-traps and Rube Goldberg booby traps! LAUGH at the unforgettable 'Truffle Shuffle!' APPLAUD as our heroes save the day, and WISH they'd made a sequel. Donner's wine has improved with age. The rapid pacing, the unraveling mystery, the over-lapping dialogue...and the incomparable Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli. Ahhhh, what a great actress. She scared the lice off of me as a kid, and can still do it, sixteen years later. And Sloth, cousin to the Incredible Hulk. How much can one love a misunderstood movie mutant? And Jeff Cohen as Chunk, possibly the greatest juvenile scene-stealer in motion picture history, (although, unlike most kid actors, you WANT him to do it).OVER 21 ALERT: It's not just a kids' movie!

618349,5,6303212379,"The Goonies DVD surpassed my expectations. Ranging from its easy-to-navigate 3-D menus to its extra features, this is certainly one of the most well-realized DVD's yet. The bonus features themselves make up for the long delay in its release. The commentary was undoubtedly the best part of the DVD: 17 years down the line, all seven main characters (""Mikey"", Sean Austin; ""Brad"", Josh Brolin; ""Chunk"", Jeff Cohen; ""Mouth"", Cory Feldman; ""Andi"", Kerri Green; ""Data"", Ke Huy-Quan; ""Stef"", Martha Plimpton; and the director & producer of the film, Richard Donner) gather together and all sit viewing the film in a recording studio, reminiscing about their experience along the way. Most of the cast have changed beyond all recognition, as is evident by the brief ""hidden video treasures"" which are periodically shown throughout the film in its commentary-enabled mode. All four of the deleted scenes which were shown on the Disney Channel airing, but left out in the final cut, are included as ""outtakes"", and high-quality ones at that. It would have been great if, as an extra option, they could be incorporated in the film, but perhaps that's asking a little too much. Both parts of Cyndi Lauper's video, directed by none other that Richard Donner, are included. Along with a trailer which conveys absolutely none of the film's sense of adventure and charm. And last but not least, a 7-minute behind-the-scenes ""Making of"" which is quite interesting. Speaking as a layman, I found the sound & picture quality of the film absolutely extraordinary, given the time period when this film was made. There are very few negative aspects to this DVD; those there are range from the (minor) fact Warner Bros. opted for a cardboard snap case instead of the more traditional full-sleeve plastic case, to the more significant event of Sean Austin's mysterious ""walk-out"" in the middle of the commentary feature, to the (even more significant) fact that there weren't any bona fide ""outtakes"", nor other unearthed scenes, beyond what was included on the uncut Disney Channel's airing. When all's said and done, nothing beyond a 2-Disc Criterion Edition, is good enough for this film.",998524800,3,2169,5.095505617977528

Definately the best part of this edition aside from the actual movie is the Richard Donner and cast commentary.  All, and I mean all of the original Goonies are together for a full commentary that runs through the entire film. It is so funny because they talk about how much fun it was to make the movie and how hard it was too. One of the things I loved about it was that they made fun of some of the same things my friends and I used to make fun of.  It's a very nostalgic trip because if you loved this movie as a kid you will fall for it again.  Martha Plimpton's comments are priceless, she is so funny.  I could have done without some of Corey Feldman's lame ""I did this... and I did that in the movie.."" comments.  He makes joke after joke, but no one really seems to be paying a lot of attention to him.  Jeff Cohen (Chunk) is slimmed down and is now a lawyer.  He supplies a lot of funny moments in the commentary as well.  In conclusion, the gang's all here and any fan of this movie must have this great DVD.

Of course there are deleted scenes, including the convenience store and octopus scene, all of which I had never seen but heard about for years and they are great.  There's also a very cool commentary with Dick Donner and all of the Goonie kids, which thumbnails the movie and shows all of them together at various point in the movie.  It's strange seeing how different they look, yet still the same.  There is also the Cindy Lauper music video ""Good Enough"" with the Goonies, Steven Spielberg, and several old WWF wrestlers (Capt. Lou Albano, Roddy Piper, Iron Shiek, Nikoli Volkoff, Fred Blassie, and Andre the Giant) as well as the theatrical trailer and original behind-the-scenes documentary, all of which I had  never seen before.

What follows is a fast-paced adventure with caverns, crooks, skeletons, booby-traps, and a old pirate ship. There is also a liberal sprinkling of funny lines to go with all the thrills and chills.
While this is a fine movie, and great fun to watch, it is not a long-lost Hollywood classic. It doesn't have the action of the Errol Flynn version of ""Robin Hood"", the drama of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", or the classic humor of ""Arsenic And Old Lace"".

 The Goonies holds something that every kid should find magical, even though the only magic in the movie is the magic of friendship. Steven Spielberg wrote the story about a group of friends who are about to lose their houses so a country club can be built where they leave. They come upon a treasure map that supposedly has a legend behind it, and leads to a great treasure. Mikey and his colorful bunch of friends set up to go in search of the treasure not knowing the villianist trio, the Fratellis, are also out for the treasure. Along the way, chaos ensues, friendships go stronger, and they meet a creature who has nothing but love to share and Baby Ruths to eat.
 The characters are all likable . . . are all lovable, and the actors who portray them made them all that they were. The Fratellis are even, in some ways, likable throughout the movie, but in the end, they get what they were asking for. The directing, of course, is awesome. None like it actually. And the sets are amazing. Especially the pirate ship set. That was too awesome, and enough to satisfy any adventure lover.
 The DVD should satisfy any Goonies fan with the word of all the extras to be on it. And I'm ready to see the infamous deleted octopus scene. I hope it's on there. I believe I read somewhere that some of the cast had gotten together to do a commentary. Now there's wishful hoping that that did happen!

618528,5,6303212379,"I've read some of the bad reviews about the Goonies, and it's sick to think that these people are allowed to live in our society.  The first of their problems was that the (Statue) and the Rosalita (Mouth speaking spanish) scenes were too vulgar for a kids movie!  KIDS HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT SOMETIMES YOU DUMMIES!  Atleast their is genuine comedy in this film.  If you don't like it then go and watch Pokemon and a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen film and be enlightened by all their cheesiness!
THE 2ND Thing people critisized was the fact that any kid would have ditched out on the adventure once that they saw that there was a way out through the well.  DIDN'T YOU PEOPLE EVEN WATCH THE FILM!  MIKE QUOTES, ""THE NEXT TIME YOU TAKE A TEST IT WILL BE IN SOME OTHER SCHOOL, THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE SKY IT WILL BE OVER A DIFFERENT TOWN, DOWN HERE IT'S OUR TIME!!!""  THESE KIDS WERE HEROES, if any of you viewers would have bailed out in that situation then I KNOW that you PROBABLY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AT MANY THINGS IN LIFE DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SCARED!
The last thing is the fact that Data  mentions the Octopuss scene even after it was cut out of the film!  DO YOU THINK RICHARD DONNER, SPEILBERG, AND CHRIS COLUMBUS ARE THAT STUPID!  They knew they had a cult hit on their hands when they put out this film, and they knew everyone would be wondering about the octopuss, and they knew that everyone would pay more money one day to see the deleted scenes because of that (Hence the DVD VERSION, and previously when it was released on the Disney Channel in '87 with the deleted scenes).

The amount of Big name Talent behind the scenes is Phenomenal. Richard Donner is in the Directors Chair; Steven Spielberg came up with the Story and Produced it while Chris Columbus wrote the Screenplay. Rarely is a film in Such Good Hands.
My Favourite Scenes are Too Numerous to List, but I Will Anyway. Firstly we have the Spectacular opening Prison Escape and Car Chase, then the ""Truffle Shuffle"" scene (I Think that's how you Pronounce it), Mouth showing Rosalita around the house, the gang escaping from Brand (Data: ""Hey Brand, how far can you stretch that?), Mouth causing Chunk to open the door of the Restaurant, the gangs first ""Sloth"" encounter (Chunk: ""Sounds like Kong""), the Fertelli's picking up Chunk (Chunk: ""In Third grade I cheated on my History exam, In Forth grade...""). All that takes place in the films first half, for those who haven't seen it... I'm Telling you, you Don't know what your Missing Out on.
Many Childhood favourites lose their Shine as one grows Older, but my Love for ""The Goonies"" just gets Stronger and Stronger as the years go by.

There is a scene based in a local/corner/grocery store with mouth, data, mikey, chunk and I think thats it, (only seen it once).  There is another version of the introduction also, which is longer, and shows more car chase and more of the locals, i.e. cheerleaders, football team, mikey, chunk, data, mouth...  These two additions and the octopus were only shown on fox, when goonies made it's T.V. debut, and subsequent tv showings have not included the scenes, (?) I don't have any idea why not. I'm a huge fan of this movie, it has never failed to entertain me. I expect that they will include lots of fun special features, despite the fact that this is a warner brothers release. *W.Bro's usually don't include any special features on their older movies, from the mid 80's or earlier.

618535,4,6303212379,"I've always loved THE GOONIES. It's arch villains (the Fratelli's and their Mama with her tatoos) are inspired casting!  The film has an innocent, Hardy Boys sense of adventure that is hard to resist.  I've always enjoyed the hyper-active line readings in the film. You can tell that director Richard Donner created an ad-lib atmosphere on the set. Some of the lines are hilarious and I always hear something new during repeated viewings.
The DVD has a great bonus:  The commentary is a screen within the film of the reunited actors.  They got everybody back!  Check out how the child actors have grown up!  Some of the commentary is hilarious.  Martha Plimpton has some particularly enjoyable memories and a ferocious laugh.
The cut scenes (including the famous Octopus scene) are disappointing.  The Octopus looks really fake.  No wonder they cut it!  The digital revolution of the 90's really changed filmaking.  Today, the Octopus would be CGI.
Also, it was fun to see the second part of Cyndi Lauper's ""Goonies"" video.  I used to watch MTV all the time, trying to catch part two!  I never saw it.  It seemed like they only played part one.  This video, with its campy wrestling stars and lovely, kooky Cyndi, is a hoot!

618581,5,6303212379,"Let me begin by saying that ""Goonies"" is by far one of the best movie of all time. It is appealing to all generations. It is every kids dream to break away from their parents and pursue their dreams, however far fetched.  Every young boy dreams of running away, fighting pirates and being the hero. This movie has it all.  It shows life from the view of a normal kid having the courage to do what all kids wish they could.  In the midst of murders and hidden treasure when all the kids get scared and what to go home, Mikey (Sean Austin) reminds them that ""this is our time, down here, no parents...,"". The Goonies will be popular for generations to come.  Although the plot is a complete fantasy, there is a lesson to be learned.  It teaches kids to follow their dreams and do what they know in their hearts is the right thing.  It also teaches parents that just because kids are young and inexperienced, doesn't mean what they have to say isn't important.  Adults sometimes have a hard time admitting that their kids may be right and they may be wrong.

Like so many others, I dreamed of fighting pirates and bad guys when I was a kid, and this movie spoke to that child in me who still exists. Every time I drive by Goonie house, I almost expect to see someone sliding across a wire from one house to the next, or old lady Fratelli breaking her boys from the jail. (It's still there for all to see.)That's the fun part about movies. Was it really real? Who cares. It was fun, wasn't it? That's all that counts. I'm really looking forward to seeing this on DVD.

The characters are based upon a gang of kids who at any point could have been you when you were younger.

They find a treasure  map , and investigate in what  could be hidden treasure from the Spanish  Armada, but there is one crucial flaw, The  Frattelis' a family of  ex-cons,who discover their plan and attmept to claim the treasure for their  own. This movie definitely epitomizes teen life in the 80's and will  hopefully grab the attention of a new audience. Definitely not  dated,spectacular sets,effects,backdrops. A bit to much yelling  though! but  thats the goons for you !  Recomendations Indiana Jones 1,2,3. (1980-89)  Stand By Me (1986) Masters of the Universe (1985) Hook (1993) Star Wars  (1977-00) Just to name a few. Mark Phillip Stassen .",954806400,2,849,5.154411764705882
618737,5,6303212379,"There's no question about it, this is the best movie ever made!  The combination of the crack-up cast and the and the fact that it's the best adventure story ever put on film makes this movie a must-own.  If even for  a second you think that this film is just for kids, think again!  If you  haven't seen this movie yet, then you don't know what a really really good  movie really is!  You'll find yourself laughing so hard it hurts, but at  the same time you'll be gripping your seat in suspense.  Being one of Sean  Astin's first movies, it's incredable that it's easilly his best!  You  need to see this movie!",953424000,,613,4.327433628318584
618738,5,6303212379,i must say that even though i'm now 18 i still LOVE this movie.  it has to be a clandestine classic!  all ages will find something to love in it!  the only thing that could improve it would possibly be the re-release with ALL  the cut scenes.,952992000,,242,4.085106382978723

618740,4,6303212379,"I don't know one kid from their mid 20's to late teens that hasn't seen this movie.  It's a classic!  Just to see the truffle-shuffle is enough to buy this movie.  I'd give this movie a 5 stars, but I do have one problem  with it.  I think that there is a part missing.  Ok...I remember when the  Goonies were underground, Data had to fight a squid.  He fell through the  ground and found this squid.  But this tape does not have that part.  (just  to prove that the squid exists) In the end of the movie when the police  were questioning the kids, Data made a remark about ""the squid.""  If this tape had that part, it'd get a 5.  Other then that, Goonies is  great",952646400,,665,4.118110236220472
618741,5,6303212379,"I saw this movie when I was 8 or 9 and I was absolutely convinced that I had to be part of the Goonies even though I was a girl.

618743,5,6303212379,"As a kid growing up in the 80's the world was pretty boring.  I'd drag my friends on contrived, half-imaginary adventures looking for treasure, causing mischief, or doing whatnot.  In between exploring storm drains and  climbing on rooftops I happened to catch the goonies when I was about ten.  Immediately I loved it, and still do.  For anybody who gets tired of the  humdrum of daily life watch the goonies and remember what life was like  before the world crushed your creative energy, imagination, and reckless  exuberance.  Unfortunately no real adventure similiarly to the Goonies has  happened to me yet, but as I still continue to drag friends on my  adventures I can still hope!
IMPORTANT: at least five or six scenes, one  of which is crucial to really understanding the movie, were edited out.  You can download these off the net.  They are worth doing.
Also, in the  credits a Curtis Hanson is listed as playing Mr. Perkins.  Anybody know if  this is the same curtis hanson who worked on l.a. confidential and payback  some ten years later?",948067200,3,1053,4.787709497206704
618774,5,6303212379,"I still remember how I felt when I first went to see this film, and I still love it as much today.  It is an Indiana Jones film for children, the story of a group of friends who come together to say goodbye.  Their homes  are being torn down to make way for new developments, and the kids are  desperate to try to save them.  But where to get the money?  The answer  comes in the form of a treasure map that is locked in the attic of one of  the kid's homes.  From then on, it's one great adventure after another, as  the misfits avoid traps, crooks and many other obstacles to do what no  grown up could ever do before....find the legendary pirate 'One Eyed  Willie's"" lost treasure.  A great family film, one you will want to  watch over and over, with or without your children. No home should be  without it.",947980800,2,811,4.175324675324675

The action scenes are great and its got great humor. My favorite part is at the end when everyone  watches the pirate ship sail off into the ocean.

618779,5,6303212379,"I first watched this movie when i was 11, it is such a fantastic movie. Now 7 years later I still love this movie. Its about a group of young kids that go out on an adventure. They find a map which leads them through a  great maze of traps and bad people. The laughs are many with characters  such as the portly CHUNK and a young Corey Feldman. I have watched this  film at least 30 times and it never gets boring. If you haven't seen it  what are you waiting for.",945907200,,464,3.956989247311828

I always wondered what it would be like to have  these sort of adventures, and this film encapsulated this for me as a  child. I don't know if it still has appeal for kids (I'm waiting til my  nephew is old enough before I buy it for me...er, him) but I'm willing to  bet that it still has appeal for a lot of young adults who remember it  first time around.
