8274422,1,B0019KYB1Y,".... This is a terrible movie, BUT....
I bought it because it's the earliest known film with Cheerio Meredith (Emma Watson on The Andy Griffith Show) in it.
Fortunately, she's in it very early on, so you don't have to watch the rest .... :)

The movie is a rather interesting study in the morality of the day though.",1391644800,,316,4.3559322033898304
