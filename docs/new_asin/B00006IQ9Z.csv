While the decription of warm-ups and instruments are passable, the rodas and demonstrations are singular and violent. This is not the dvd you want if you are a real Capoeira enhusiast. It is basically a taped class; All the games shown are a very violent regional style, Angola is not even mentioned, and ""fighting techniques"" are wrestling and boxing techniques that have nothing to do with Capoeira. Their music isn't very good, either. I have studied Capoeira under credible instructors for a while, and I can tell you that if you want a dvd on Capoeira, a company that makes budget aerobics videos is not the way to go.",1034035200,4,777,4.8059701492537314

7969350,1,B00006IQ9Z,"First of all, the tangible items are low quality; the DVD was not professionally made, but burned and labeled, probably at someone's house. The case insert is grainy and printed on regular paper. Next, the camerawork and audio on the DVD are poor: zoomed in too close to see the full movement in a lot of cases, no transition, and no explanations. The content on the other hand is acceptable. The DVD basically shows a Capoeira class (stretching, warm-up with basic moves, and a roda), which was long enough for you to see some good play. Then it finishes with an ""advanced"" moves section that started with boxing (?!) and has no dialogue until the end. If you don't have Capoeira in your area and you don't mind overpriced burned media, go for it. But, if you happen to live in a city where Capoeira is taught, ask your local instructor to sit in on a class. Most likely, you'll be invited to join the first class for free. Either way you'll get a better introduction to Capoeira. Axe.",1129334400,5,986,4.5139664804469275

7969352,1,B00006IQ9Z,"This is NOT a good DVD for beginners..or anyone else. Like others have said,it's just a taped Capoeira class,with no explanation of how to do any of the techniques. I would be willing to buy a DVD of justa Capoeira demonstration if it was advertised that way,and if the camerawork was professional. Some of the Capoeristas on the program are very good,but it's not worth the money. I got this and the advanced Capoeria dvd for FREE with another order I placed, and I STILL feel ripped off! Avoid at all cost..unless that cost is free.",1091923200,27,534,4.572916666666667
7969353,1,B00006IQ9Z,"OK, I can respect low budget film making, but this is a waste of money.  First, the sound is so horrible, and the accents so thick, that you cannot understand a single word they are saying.  Second, there is no explanation of anything they are doing (the name has been changed--when I bought it last month, it said ""Capoeira for Beginners""--which sounds like it is instructional).  Third, the picture/filming quality is annoying.  There are no transitions, the picture just ""skips"" to the next move.  The camera jumps around and makes illogical pans and close-ups.  Fourth, this DVD is so short that even the content is not worth the money.
So, no-budget recording + no content= a horrible viewing experience.",1074816000,29,709,4.915966386554622
7969354,5,B00006IQ9Z,"the movie is cool but I only so a small peak on it but it was dope, but the camera wasn't so good on keeping the film but the ladies were hotttttt yeah.",1044748800,,152,3.6363636363636362
7969355,2,B00006IQ9Z,"If a your capoeirista with a few years under your belt... I suggest your go find other Capoeira DVDs, for instance Grupo Axe Capoeira DVD is a lot better.  The DVD is ok for beginners... but I'm happy that Capoeira has upgraded from VHS to DVD.  Axe!",1037664000,5,250,4.297872340425532
