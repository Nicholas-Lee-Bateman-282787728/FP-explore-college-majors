1970656,3,B00014TCRM,"If you are already an active person, used to an exercise routine with a moderate to high intensity level, you may be disappointed in this DVD. There was too much talk and not enough action for me. I did, however, learn a bit about correct form when lifting free weights, but I was disappointed that the workout wasn't more intense.  In short, if you are a beginner, in need of an instructional video, this is the one for you.",1173312000,2,425,4.379746835443038

1970658,5,B00014TCRM,"As a very busy fifty-something woman I have found this DVD to be quite helpful.  I've used it about 3 times a week for a month, and  I am very pleased to report that I have advanced enough to move from 1 lb. weights to 2 lb. weights, which for me is a big improvement.  This DVD does not drag the way some other exercise DVDs do, and I find Robyn Stuhr and Cindy Joseph to be quite inspiring (and not the least bit condescending).  I plan to continue with this exercise program (who knows, maybe I'll work my way up to 10 lb weights), and, because I am pleased with this product, I intend to purchase the ""Keeping Fit in Your 50s"" flexibility DVD as well.",1138924800,45,655,4.133858267716535

1970660,2,B00014TCRM,"The instructor takes up too much time in talking, and in a too-condescending voice, more appropriate for children.  Neither of the participants has a good sense of rhythm - why use music if you're not going to keep time?  Then, after the workout, no stretch.  I would not have bought this had I seen it first - it was a waste of money for my requirements.  It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because if you ignore the criticisms above and put a lot of effort into it you can end up with a halfway-decent workout.  But any workout should have a stretching section at the end!",1111708800,41,568,4.271028037383178
1970661,4,B00014TCRM,"I received this exercise DVD yesterday and used it for the first time today with my friend. She and I are in our mid and late fifties and had been doing a strengthening exercise video together but the VCR died and so we're using the DVD player instead.

I loved this DVD in comparison to the video. The video had a fitness expert leading several every-day type folks in the exercises. I found the other people distracting and they didn't always do the exercises properly and she had to show them how to do them correctly. I got tired of seeing that replayed every time I did the exercises. Also, the expert talked to us between the rep sets. That was fine the first few times, but got tiresome after a while. On the DVD, she goes back and forth between two different exercises rather than having actual rest times. This seemed a more effective use of time. The DVD seemed to be more professionally done than the video also.

I am fairly new to weight lifting so don't have an opinion about slow or fast weight lifting. If you are convinced that slow weight lifting is the only effective way to do weight lifting, you will not want to do this program. She moves at a pretty fast clip. We were sweating at the end of this program and we weren't with the other program. I have read the controversy about whether or not slow movements are more effective. I am not convinced either way yet, so I am going to stay with the faster pace. I liked it much better. I wasn't receiving any of the promised benefits of the slow way after several months.

As soon as I can afford it, I am going to order the flexibility and aerobic DVDs as well.",1090886400,77,1630,4.3202614379084965
1970682,4,B00014TCRM,"This dvd is excellent if you have not worked out in a while. The moves are easy and there is minimal pain the next day. I have done all three dvds back to back and I am pleased with the results. I have been receiving complements for losing inches.

The only drawback to this dvd is that you are given instructions as to when an exercise is going to change. Cindy tries to encourage Robin to talk at times but Robin just changes exercises with not warning or countdown. Other than this, the video is well thought out and there is plenty of motivation in the videos.",1452988800,,564,4.271028037383178
1970683,5,B00014TCRM,"This exercise DVD is excellent! Sensible and age appropriate exercises clearly taught and demonstrated. I used it faithfully beginning in January. By the time we went to the Gulf in Florida that summer, I could kayak for hours without suffering any soreness later. It pays to work out regularly with this DVD.",1452902400,4,309,4.961538461538462
1970684,4,B00014TCRM,"As a person that has exercised on & off all my adult life I got this because at age 52, I find my body is changing, I cant go as fast as I did following numerous dvd's that I've worked out with so many times in my 20's - 40's! My knees & hip joints bother me and make me modify or avoid some exercises I've done so many times in my 20's - 40's! So I got this and yes, too much instruction. It's like at age 50+ they think you have never exercised before and over explain everything. The exercises are good though, nothing fancy but good run-of-the mill weight exercises, you choose a weight that makes it challenging for you. I liked the advanced exercises also! So I plan to next time turn the volume down on the dvd, put on some fun old time Rock n Roll music and just follow along as they do the exercises! :) No cool down though?!",1451433600,6,834,4.030120481927711
1970685,3,B00014TCRM,"I'm 48 and find it difficult to locate good DVDs made for my age group that are not totally too fast and difficult to follow. Someone jumping around at a rapid pace is just not something I want to do anymore. As I near 50 I'm more interested in finding workouts that show me exercises I can actually do and at a pace I can actually keep up with. So with that said, here is what my impressions were with this DVD.

This DVD is only for absolute beginners. I say this because there is a lot of talking and explanation that people who have been exercising for years will just not need. The exercises themselves are very simple and can be done by almost anyone with regular physical abilities. You are probably very familiar with sit ups, lunges, squats, etc. The one thing I could appreciate about this workout is that there are some exercises that are done with the support of a chair. That was helpful for keeping balance.

Some of the things I found annoying however were the times when exercises were changed from one thing to another without enough time to move the chair, put down a mat or fix a stretch band for specific exercises. With so much talking other times it would have been helpful if they'd talked during the transitions too.

If you are using this on a regular basis you can skip most of the chit chat and go straight to the program index and select the actual fitness program which is from section 6-10. Section 11 is another section of health advice.

What do you need for this routine? Well you'll need a sturdy chair, light hand weights, a sturdy large book like a dictionary, a stretchy band and a mat. You could really skip needing a book if you want and I didn't use a mat.

I did not feel tired after exercising so I feel this is a very moderate workout.

One thing I would not try is the exercise where you put your foot up on the chair and do squats on one leg. That looked so tricky and even the instructor was about to fall over.

Otherwise the voice of the instructor was pleasant and calming which was nice.

The music is mostly jazzy and rock instrumental so it keeps you motivated. The instructions are encouraging and keep you following safety precautions most of the time. The instructor never encourages you to go beyond what you are able to do.

So this is great for beginners if they can overlook the set design which is three walls of light panels and a floor made up of loose fabric which wrinkles in places.

1970686,5,B00014TCRM,"I am 76 years old and in fairly good shape. My doctor son impressed upon me that I need to build more muscle and strengthen my bones, which was the reason I bought this DVD. I liked the way the instructor showed you the proper form of doing the workout, not only at the beginning, but also as they do each one. They also alternate the muscle groups, which not only is a better way of working the muscles, but also provide the variety. After working with it for a month or so, I increased the weights, a clear indication of my muscles are getting stronger. After a few times, I felt I got the moves down, I wrote down each exercise, and can do them now without looking at the tape, which saves some time, and also allows me to workout with my own music or audiobooks.

I strongly recommend this DVD to all women over certain age. Never too late to improve oneself.",1440028800,29,863,4.2303030303030305

Finally, real women who are knowledgeable and not super-skinny -- good role models. This DVD is about being healthy not thin. The lead instructor really knows her stuff and beginners (or experts who are constantly injuring themselves, then come to my yoga class and ask me to ""fix them"") need to pay attention to her! Use this for a couple of months, then when you are confident to go on to something more intense, pass it along to another woman getting serious about starting exercise!  4 stars instead of 5 as I think the title needs to specify ""for beginners.""",1322092800,5,732,4.503759398496241

It is a very simple routine that is made extra long by too much talking between the instructors.  Instruction is fine, but they go overboard.  They also cannot keep a beat.

I assumed the video would have a quick 2-3 minute demo at the beginning, then 30 minutes or so of weight training accompanied by an instructor's verbal commands with appropriate music as I do in my body-sculpting class. Instead these women and their chatter are featured throughout the video. It's as if the purpose of the video is to showcase these women instead of weight training.

8006441,2,B00014TCRM,There's too much talking. When I open a disc to exercise I want to get right to it.  I do not like all the talking and talking....,1519084800,,130,3.814814814814815
8006442,3,B00014TCRM,"I recently picked up this DVD (as part of a set) at a used book sale. I will turn 50 in about 6 months, and I thought this might be a good addition to my fitness DVD collection. Well, as it turns out, this DVD isn't really geared towards someone like me, who is already an regular exerciser. The routine moves VERY slowly.  It also uses a variety of equipment, which may be a deterrent to some beginners--you will need several sets of weights, a band, and a chair.

This workout is led by Robin Stuhr, an exercise physiologist, assisted by Cindy Joseph, a fitness model. The DVD is well-chaptered, with the workout menu lists the following options (times added):

1. Introduction [4:32]
2. Body Basics [4:34]
3. Workout Tips [:27]
4. Know Your Muscles [4:04]
5. Core Routine: Intro [:31]
6. Core Routine: Warm-Up [3:56]
7. Core Routine: Part 1 [19:04]
8. Core Routine: Part 2 [4:17]
9. Core Routine: Part 3 [7:15]
10. Core Routine: Abdominals [8:13]
11. Advanced Exercises [7:52]
12. Keeping Fit Fundamentals [8:44]

Stuhr seems quite inexperienced as a fitness instructor.  Perhaps she has worked with training people-one-one, but she seems ill-at-ease leading a fitness video; she also says ""terrific"" way too much.  Joseph's role is rather odd as well, as Joseph introduces some of the segments herself but then is relegated to making somewhat pithy comments throughout the workout.

Despite these comments, the actual workout routine was not bad.  It's nice that the DVD is so well-chaptered, although the breakdowns for the main workout (""Core Routine"") are confusing--i.e., it doesn't really make sense that Part 1 is almost 20 minutes long while the section section is <5 minutes.  Most of the exercises are performed for 2 sets of 10 repetitions.  Stuhr either uses no resistance (squats), dumbbells (rows, biceps curls, triceps kickbacks), or the band (leg extensions).  The last section of the Core Routine (could have been labelled ""Part 4"") is a nice basic abs routine that includes some back work.  Unlike the ""Aerobic"" DVD in this series, this Strength DVD does not include a cool-down or stretch.  I didn't really feel like I need one, but there is a separate Flexibility DVD if needed.  There is a segment on ""Advanced"" exercises that I would personally not consider advanced at all; rather, they add slightly more intense modifications to some of the exercises, such as a lunge with arms overhead.

I am on the fence about this DVD.  I did feel that I was able to get a decent workout from it, but that was mainly because I inserted my own more advanced modifications--for example, I used heavier weights, and I completed about 15 repetitions for every 10 performed by Stuhr.  As is, I would say that this routine is decent for the intended audience of those older/newer to exercise, although it could be better instructed and more user-friendly.",1507593600,,2863,4.870103092783505
