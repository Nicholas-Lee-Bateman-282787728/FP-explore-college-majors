8459925,5,B0056WEQ3O,Excellent movie. You feel as if you are there living through the horror yourself. It makes you aware how tragic those circumstances really were and how inexplicable it is for human beings to be able to do what those monsters did.,1334102400,,229,4.609756097560975
8459926,5,B0056WEQ3O,"If you have a region-free dvd player, don't be afraid to purchase this film. The audio for this version of Memories of Anne Frank is actually done in English - and not Italian or Dutch. The film was apparently made in Italy and it has Dutch subtitles. The dvd extra ""The Last 7 Months of Anne Frank"" is sadly in Dutch only, with no English subtitles. However, this old documentary is available elsewhere in English on VHS tape. This is a highly artistic version of the story. Certain episodes in Anne Franks life are highlighted and extended in length in order to create a deep emotional response from the viewer. The music of Ennio Morricone very effectively reinforces the pathos. The director saves time by allowing characters to say and do things that were actually said and done by others. But the film makes clear at the beginning and end - that it is only loosley based on Hannah Goslar's book about her best friend Anne. Most of the focus is on Anne, her friend Hannah, Otto, and Peter. Very little is done with Edith, Margot, Mr. & Mrs. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel. There is a very interesting device added in the concentration camp. In that a totally fictitious  character - a young, low-level Nazi officer, is added who forces a Jewish rabbi to teach him philosophy, and in the process is himself forced to confront his own actions as seen through his formerly repressed conscience. This movie is highly recommended and will bring you to tears many times.",1327536000,5,1462,4.623076923076923
