This film examines the roots of the Baathist movement which ruled Iraq from 1968 until 2003 and holds a bloody grip on power in Syria today.
It studies the influence Nazi Germany had on Michel Aflaq the founder of the Baath movement when he was a student in Europe
Nazism inspired and held the fierce loyalty of Islamic and Arab nationalists across the Muslim world in the 1930s and World War II from the Young Egypt movement which held torch lit Nazi-like processions in Cairo and Alexandra, to the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party which had a swastika like emblem and out of which morphed the Baath movement.
The film examines the pivotal role in the Middle East of the Mufti Haj Amin el Husseini , the founder of Palestinian nationalism and close ally of Adolf Hitler. Husseini was the power behind the Nazi inspired Arab revolt of the 1930s in the Palestine mandate which murdered Jews, moderate Arabs and British soldiers. After he fled to Lebanon and then to Iraq he was a guest of Hitler in Nazi Germany (fascinating footage of his meeting with Hitler in Berlin in 1941) . He was a close friend of Adolf Eichmann and founded and commanded a ruthless battalion of Waffen SS made up of Bosnian Muslims which were the force of the Holocaust  in Yugoslavia killing tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies.
Meanwhile the Arabs of North Africa hailed Rommel and his Africa Corps as liberators from the yolk of British imperialism , and the Arabs of the then Palestine Mandate were making plans with the Nazis to take control of that country and extend the Holocaust to the Holy Land and rid it of it's Jewish population.
The movie also documents the pro-Axis coup in Iraq in 1941 and the battle of the pro-Axis Iraqis (which included Saddam's uncle and mentor Khairallah Talfah)  against the British forces.

Explains how the Baath Party was directly based on Nazi ideology and how Saddam who as a young man keenly studied Meim Kampf would ape Hitler's style of rule by terror and mass murder. Saddam ordered the mass murder of hundreds of thousands-the fact is inescapable . It also traces Saddam's rise to power. These facts will not be palatable to the post-modern left which supported Saddam as a hero against 'Western Imperialism' in the 1990s and in the follow up and during the 2003 Iraq War. It is not at all surprising therefore that Saddam was a great patron of Palestinian terror and propaganda.  Ironically since the 1960s Saddam had killed thousands of Iraqi communists but that didn't stop the communists of the world from later supported Saddam against thew West and against his own people. Regardless of whether Saddam has weapons of mass destruction or not, he himself was a mass murderer that the world is well rid of.
During the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Hannah Arendt commented on the astounding degree of anti-Jewish venom and praise for Hitler in the Arab press together with regret that he ""did not finish the job"".
40 years later the state-controlled Egyptian daily Al Akhbar (April 18, 2001) declared ""Our thanks to the late Hitler who wrought, in advance, the vengeance of the Palestinians upon the most despicable villains on the face of the earth. However we rebuke Hitler for the fact that the vengeance was insufficient"".
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said of the Jews after the 2006 Lebanon War ""If they gather in Israel it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide"" and former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani thundering his aims of a second holocaust and final solution declared ""The use of nuclear bomb in Israel will leave nothing on the ground, whereas it will only damage the world of Islam.""",1382313600,3,3786,4.793261868300153
8289637,5,B001CU9C8I,"This is a well presented documentary on the history of the secular Arab fascist Baath Party and it's Nazi origins. It also chronicles the rise and fall of notorious Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and gives profiles on the three men who had contributed both directly and indirectly in shaping his future life as a cunning, brutal leader of Iraq: Michel Aflaq, a Syrian intellectual and founder of the Baath Party, Khairallah Talfah, a former Iraqi military officer and Arab ultranationalist (who was also Saddam's uncle and surrogate father), and the Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini (a radical Muslim leader and veteran of the first World War on the Ottoman Empire side) who led violent uprisings against British colonial rule in Jerusalem and who was venomously anti-Semitic. Al-Husseini would later became a general of Muslim SS units in Nazi Germany. This DVD gives us further insight on the origins of contemporary Arab hostility towards the West going back to the Sikes-Picot agreements in WWI; the French and British colonial powers arbitrarily drawing up and defining borders that went against and excluded Arab interests, and it led to the establishment of a puppet monarchy in Iraq. Nazi Germany would form relations with radical Arab nationalists in the Middle East based on a mutual hatred of the Jews and give them military aid against the British. As time went on after WWII, the video also chronicles the series of wars, revolutions and coups that happened in Iraq (in particular, the coup that led to the overthrow and assassination of King Faisal in 1958 and Iraq becoming a republic), and how the Iraqi branch of the Baath Party and Saddam Hussein rose to and fell from power. I recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interests on why things happened the way they did in Iraq.",1311292800,2,1793,4.920792079207921
