434442,5,6302179815,"This is the classic, perfect presentation of scale, presenting both a realistic picture of the wide variations in the Universe and our own nearly random place in it.  I first came across this film (actually it was the ""rough sketch"" version) at the Ontario Science Center in the 1970s.  I must have sat through the film loop at OSC a dozen times.  I never tire of it.",1023148800,10,367,4.447761194029851
434443,5,6302179815,"It is impossible to overstate how amazing this little movie is.  I still remember seeing it for the first time, at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., at the age of nine, wearing my Boston Red Sox baseball cap.  I think I literally had to be dragged away, I just wanted to see it again and again.
This video contains both the final version of the film, which I saw as a child, and the original, discarded film from which the final version was derived.  In the final version, the ""camera"" begins by focusing on a couple lying out on a picnic blanket, in a small park in Chicago.  Every ten seconds, the camera pulls back by a factor of ten, AKA a single ""order of magnitude,"" for all you non-scientists out there.  Gradually you come to see the entire park, then the city of Chicago, then the entire metropolitan region, the Great Lakes, North America, Earth...  At the end of four minutes, the ""camera"" has pulled back by ten to the twenty-fourth meters, which is far enough back to be far outside of our Milky Way galaxy, and even outside our local supercluster, the Virgo supercluster.  One almost wishes that Ray and Charles Eames had attempted this marvel of a film after the 1980s, when, due to advances in our astronomical understanding of the universe, they could have included an extra 30 or 40 seconds of pulling back the camera, to include large-scale structure, the ""Great Attractor,"" etc.  Anyway, after the four minutes of pulling the camera back, they zip it back in at the couple on the blanket at five times the original speed, in 48 seconds flat.  (For more fun than humans should be allowed, you might want to use your remote control to fast-forward this part.  What a ride!!!)  Anyway, the camera zips in to focus on the hand of the man lying on the picnic blanket, and then goes INWARD, into the cells on his hand, within his DNA, inside a carbon atom, and into the very nucleus of the carbon atom.  The range of scales covered is ten to the fortieth power, which seeing this movie will help you understand in a profoundly visceral way.  No mean feat, eh?!!?
After this treat of a film, we see the earlier version upon which it was based.  The primary difference between the two versions is that in the first version, there is a side window kept running throughout the movie, which shows the effect of relativity on the time-keeping of ten seconds per order of magnitude of meters travelled.  Around the time the ""camera"" pulls back from 10-to-the-13th to 10-to-the-14th meters, the subjective time-sense of the camera operator would start to be strongly affected by relativity, because the ""camera"" would start to be travelling at a significant fraction of the speed of light.  Gradually, subjective and Earthly time-sense gets so far out of whack that ten seconds for the cameraman would be 100,000,000 years on Earth.  This might have the effect of prompting the philosophically-inclined viewer to get the screaming meemies, but  it's better not to sweat the phiosophical details too much.  Just ride with it, baby.  Anyway, evidently, the producers decided that the  additional feature of the relativistic clock was too distracting, and they pulled it from the final version.  Here in this video, we get to see both versions of the film, which is a pretty tremendous experience.
If you are a science or math teacher, or if you know one with a birthday coming up, for crying out loud BUY THIS MOVIE!!!  It's so fantastic, it will make kids wonder why on Earth any rational human would ever voluntarily do anything other than study science and math.  Ten-to-the-fortieth thumbs up!",1001548800,21,3624,4.715873015873016
434444,5,6302179815,"What a joy!  I have been waiting for this DVD.  Although I have not yet  seen this DVD (I have the Laser version) I can anticipate it is going to be  a major success.  ""Powers of Ten"" is a rapid visual presentation  about the relative size of everything in the universe, as it was known in  1997 when Charles Eames and his wife Ray prepared this film (and a  companion book for Scientific America).  It starts on a summer day in  Chicago and every few seconds later, distances begin to increase ""ten  times"", at a time (10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc - thus showing the  magnification effect of adding another zero), from 10 to the power zero  (one meter) to 10 to the power 25.  Then, distances collapse and, in a back  trip, are reduced also by tens.  The entire range covers from 10 at the  power 25 (more or less, one billion light years, where entire galaxies  appear as dust particles) to ten at the power minus 16 (one tenth of the  size of quarks!).  This rapid trip from the human scale to the infinitely  large and to the infinitely small is more exhilarating than a mesmerizing  guided tour of the descending ramp of the new Rose Planetarium of the  Museum of Natural History in New York. The second major feature of this  volume is ""901"", which refers to the Eames address in Venice,  California.  The film shows their Victorian house and the materials that  they accumulated in 45 years of their careers as organizers of major  exhibitions around the world.  The entire collection was acquired by the  Smithsonian Institute.",969235200,24,1532,4.546125461254612
434445,5,6302179815,"The American architect and furniture designer Charles Eames (1907-78) met the painter Bernice Kaiser (1912-88) in the late 1930s at Cranbrook Academy. Soon after, they married, and she, a founding member of the  American Abstract Artists group who had studied with Hans Hoffman, changed  her name to Ray. Moving to California in 1941, they designed their  celebrated home, formed a business partnership, and worked collaboratively  for the rest of their livesshe died ten years after he, on exactly the  same dayon an astonishing number and variety of innovations in  architecture, industrial and furniture design (the potato chip chair, the  Eames lounge chair and ottoman), exhibit design, and documentary  photography. They also produced more than 100 short films on everything  from the history of bread to Keplers laws of planetary motion. Twenty-five  of those films are now available on video in five volumes, as is a recent  and equally wonderful film by their grandson (Eames Demetrios) about their  lives and the dismantling in 1989 of their historic studio at 901  Washington Boulevard in Venice, California. Of the films, the best-known  are Powers of Ten (of which an interactive CD-ROM version is also  available), Tops, and Toccata for Toy Trains; but equally amazing are less  familiar titles such as The Black Ships (which uses 19th-century prints to  recreate the Japanese perception of the arrival of Admiral Perry), and  Blacktop (which consists of abstract patterns formed by water on an asphalt  schoolyard). These are delightful, unparalleled films that deserve to be  regularly, commonly shown to students of art, architecture, and design.

The film, to me, shows in detail, how absolutely tiny and insignificant we are in the universe. We are nothing!!!! How happy was I to learn that this film was rereleased on a disc to enjoy again, and with my son.

This is a fabulous visual of the quantitative value of powers of ten.  I recommend it for any science or mathematics teacher to show their students as another modality to add to and enrich understanding of exponents/base ten.

The second half of the video shows the organization and functions of the studio these creative artists organized and worked in on a daily basis.  Moreover, the film shows and  expresses how science, art and mathematics are linked.

Perhaps a more ""updated"" version is an IMAX film called ""Cosmic Voyage."" We ran it when I worked at an IMAX Theatre and it's the same type of plot, rings in powers of ten pulling out from Venice, Italy going to the edge of the universe, then starting in Holland we use the rings to enter the human DNA. As soon as I saw Cosmic Voyage I thought of Powers of Ten. This has to be where the producers of Cosmic Voyage got their idea, but neither Eames nor Powers of Ten is credited, not that I remember anyway.

434521,5,6302179815,"I bought this DVD for the 8 minute ""The Powers Of Ten"". I paid 25 dls plus shipping and handling, and finally I had the chance to watch the two versions of this very short film some have suggested is the most brilliant ever. I wouldn't go that far, but, although this DVD is definitely the most expensive I've ever bought, it's worth it. A good friend of mine who was a novelist used to say every great work of art, no matter how big or small, spoke about everything or almost everything. And that's what this short film does, not only in 8 minutes, but also IN ONE SINGLE CONTINUOUS SHOT. That makes it a great work of art. I wouldn't say it's the most brilliant because I think that's something no one can say about anything, but since I first saw it, every time I have to explain how far short films can go, I start playing Charles and Ray Eames amazing film.
Now, when I bought this DVD, they hadn't still released the 6 disc box set ""The Films of Charles & Ray Eames"". I've already seen the remaining 5 discs, and although the other works aren't as witty and original as ""The Powers Of Ten"", you'll find some other shorts worth the purchase, from the slow paced and visually stunning ""The Black Ships"", about Commodore Perry's arrival to Japan in the XIX century seen through the eyes of the Japanese, to the lovely ""Toccata For Toy Trains"". My advice is: If you're interested to learn about design or sensitize yourself to material culture, get the full box set.

I originally bought the dvd for the ""Power of 10,"" to show in my interpersonal communication classes as a simple perception exercise.  It works fine for class (kind of preps people for the lecture on perception), but I also like having it to show to friends.  I find the original, ""Rough Sketch"" version of Power of 10 more interesting than the polished version.  Ray's narration in the rough sketch is nicer than Charles', and there is something about the lower budget effects that make it more interesting to watch.  Regardless of one's opinion, having both on one dvd is great.  The second film, ""901,"" was a bonus as well.  In general, the effect of the flipbook that was made from the film is, in my opinion, more effective then the film for contemplating the concept of relative distance, but if you like the flipbook you really just have to have the film to go with it.",1171238400,,936,4.568862275449102

434546,5,6302179815,"Few twenty-minutes films pack so much thought-provoking material into such a brief run-time. Here is the most famous screen work of Charles and Ray Eames, a (sadly forgotten) visionary married couple whose inventions and achievements in architecture, design, film-making and science should in fairness have made them household names. This DVD contains an introduction to the Eames themselves, an overview of their creative works, and then it presents their cinematic magnum opus, The Powers of Ten, as it was in finished 1970's form, followed by an earlier 1960's prototype of the film. The Powers of Ten opens the mind to the scale of the universe without and the universe within. It takes one from a microcosmic scene of a couple picnicking on the Chicago lakefront, then rises by a ten-fold magnification every ten seconds, from a view of the park at one-hundred meters, to a kilometer, and so on, until we view Chicago spread out below, then the whole of the American Midwest, then the earth itself, the solar system, our edge of the galaxy, the whole of the galaxy, and so on, until we reach a point in space so far removed from where we began that ours and countless other galaxies appear as the merest dim specks, star-like, and barely visible against a tableau of the inky darkness in an infinite void. We are reminded that this is what the majority of what we call space looks like: humbling blackness of unimaginable dimension with tiny pin-holes of radiance breaking through The film then reverses in scope and draws rapidly back to its starting point, and then explores the space within, as it progressively reduces by ten and takes us from the scene in the park down through the cellular level of the man at the picnic until we pass through strands of DNA and finally arrive at the tiniest speck of sub-atomic matter in existence. The Powers of Ten unavoidably compels a viewer to ponder all that lies around us and within us, and is in its simple beauty a meditative work of scientific artistry.",1158364800,4,2009,4.792507204610951
434547,5,6302179815,"From the cover of the VHS version:

Charles and Ray Eames are among the finest American designers of this century. They are best known for their ground-breaking contributions to architecture, furniture design (the Eames Chair), industrial design and manufacturing, and the photographic arts.

The legacy of this husband and wife team includes more than 75 films that reflect the breadth and depth of their interests and the integrity of their vision. Volume 1 is a part of a video collection of these classic films.

""Powers of Ten"" takes us on an adventure in magnitudes. Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us to the outer edges of the universe. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther out, until our own galaxy is visible only as a speck of light among many others.

Returning to earth with breathtaking speed, we move inward - into the hand of the sleeping picnicker - with ten times more magnification every ten seconds. Our journey ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.

This cassette also includes the original version of ""Powers of Ten,"" produced in 1968, entitled ""A Rough Sketch for a Proposed Film Dealing With the Powers of Ten and the Relative Size of Things in the Universe,"" a remarkable film in its own right.

By itself, this film may make the purchase of this DVD worthwhile for some.  It doesn't for me.  For the 1960's this film is a remarkable achivement and can say I genuinely enjoyed it my during my elemetary education (20 years ago).  But I'm not even sure that at that age that I would have wanted to watch it over and over again.  (This is a fairly steep price for a nine minute feature.)

I'm a big fan of furniture design and Architecture so I have come across the Eames name plenty of times.  That being said, I jumped at the opportunity to see their workspace.  Well you may have heard the saying a cobbler has no time to mend their own shoes.  I can't speak for how functional their office was but it was certainly no magazine showpiece.

I was less than impressed with the space presented in the film ""901: After 45 Years of Working"" (1989, 29 min.)  The film comes across (if you remove the dialog) as a film you might give your insurance agent in case of fire.  With the narrarator detailing whose office is whose and pointing out different objects.  Which is largly what I expected but it wasn't nearly as dazzling as I imagined.

When combined with the narration the film has the feel of a family friend quietly taking you through the home of their elderly parents who have just passed on (while being subjected to repetitive organ and xylophone music).

(Granted I was completely impressed with the xylophone type instrument they constructed.  I just think 5 minutes or so would have been an adequate sampling.)",1132272000,21,1634,4.469594594594595

Who else could possibly cut such a wide swath through the world of design?
