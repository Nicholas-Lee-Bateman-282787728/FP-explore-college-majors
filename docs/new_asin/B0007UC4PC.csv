8051811,5,B0007UC4PC,"Ben (the author of this DVD) and his colleagues were mainstays of the SF party/club scene from around '95 until about '04. During that time, they not only developed their highbrow style of digital abstract video installation art, but they also worked hard to build up the west coast's community of visualists. We were sad to see them go, but since moving on to international enagagements, Ben has released this DVD of his collected animated works. Every track except for the first is in high definition, and most tracks are tightly synched with the tasty idm sound. Without the sound, they're suitable for VJ mixing. The quality is universally high, and the Ben's unmistakable breakup style asserts itself  in every track. There are no hippy screensavers here!",1208304000,,760,4.984251968503937
