8048421,5,B0007LPSQS,"If your child loves Gordon, this movie may be essential to their collection. This could be a good or bad thing, depending on how much YOU like Gordon. I have now seen this video 50+ times, and I think it contributed to my son's obsession to Gordon. With that said, he absolutely ADORES his Gordon and ""Gordon Movie"" and when he's happy, I'm happy. So, yes, we recommend this movie. The last story in the movie is about Gordon's View, and is similar to the Step Into Reading Book ""Gordon's New View"" (which my son is also obsessed with). It's always nice to see a beloved story book come alive. If your child likes James as much or more than Gordon, try the Best of James as well. It's also a favorite around here! (It includes the James Goes Buzz Buzz story and you can buy the Step Into Reading Book for that one too!).",1202515200,,820,4.296774193548387
