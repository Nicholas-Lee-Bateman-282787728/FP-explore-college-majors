What are you doing offering to charge protected viewing files as season 4 episodes for this highway robbery price... and we cant even watch them in any dvd device..Nahhh, me no think so, at least add it to your FREE prime video venue. I blame MGM for their cavalier attitude in releasing some well known classic shows and then terminating the remainder series from being released on DVD. Since I got burned by them holding season 1-3 I have learned a great deal. I simply don't buy any more classic tv shows until they are fully released on DVD, I then buy separate seasons at the cheapest price I can find them, used too, AFTER they have been fully released, I don't need an incomplete series library. Yes MGM has taught me how to keep a reign on my money by their Green Acres distribution follie.

I've come to the conclusion that whoever owns the rights to the show may never release seasons 4 - 6 on DVD, so, I tried and failed to read a review that detailed the digital instant streaming format of the final seasons here on Amazon.  Instead, the only reviews available were from uptight and upset fans of the series who stated they would never purchase GREEN ACRES ever again unless in the DVD format.  Well, I'm here to say that after rewatching seasons 1 - 3 again and again over the years, every episode of season 4 I watch is an utter joy.  The streamed video looks just like a DVD or Netflix.

Incomplete season releases like MGM did here (1 Star rating) basically weakens buyer confidence in future shows, but this taught me to wait it out, see price drops.

These shows bring back many great moments of family get togethers around the TV.  My only and the major complaint is that you take so long to complete the series when you get started.  So I suggest that you consider the way you put the seasons of these series out there. Take a look at the many series that you have out there and get moving on completing the seasons, so that all of the many TV series families can enjoy them.  Believe me when I say that there is alot of us not even patiently waiting anymore for all seasons to be available.  Please stop with the short falls.

Shows like Human Target and Moonlight get on,we love them,then the networks dump them for garbage that is driving me away from the major networks. I have many friends who have held off attempting to collect a lot of these series because they don't want the frustration of an incomplete collection. Who can blame them ? The compilations to me are useless. Why buy a compilation if you want the whole series ? This so called marketing strategy seems pretty dumb to me. I would never buy a compilation because I want the whole series. You have to wonder if some of these marketing experts ever graduated grade school.

156131,5,0792898524,I started buying this series a few years ago and then for some reason they stopped making them in 2005 without finishing the series.  Why? Don't think it's just a show about some boring farmers.  Most people who haven't really sat down and watched this great show have no idea how crazy and absurdedly hilarious this show really is.  It's just as funny now as ever (actually more so; have you watched any of today's sitcoms?).  This show needs to be completed!!,1226448000,65,461,4.585365853658536

I look for these older shows as they are just plain funny. I know they say laughter is the best medicine, and these do that for me.

If you enjoy older tv series, enjoy comedy then give this some serious thought. One of my favorite episodes is the hunting one.",1477785600,,487,4.010309278350515
