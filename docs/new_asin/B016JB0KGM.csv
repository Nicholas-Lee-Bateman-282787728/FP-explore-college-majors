7473121,3,B016JB0KGM,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There is a reason why there are so many movies made about the creature that was formed in the mind of Mary Shelly. That reason is called public domain. No one owns the outright rights to the story she penned years ago which means that anyone can take this familiar character and make a movie or write a story about him as long as they don't infringe on the copyrights of others who have already done so (like the look of the Karloff monster from years ago). The sad thing is that doesnt always mean that a good movie is the result.

The movie opens with the monster waking and is told from his perspective via narration as his story unfolds. Reflecting back on his waking he recalls the first person he saw as Marie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who he calls mother. He then finds himself being subjected to various test by his father, Victor (Danny Huston) and his assistant. A few days after his birth there are signs of his body degenerating with several rotting boils showing on his skin. The team decides to kill their creation and begin fresh.

But the drugs they use to kill the monster aren't strong enough to get the job done. Escaping from the facility he makes his way to a nearby forest and finds refuge there. From this point forward many of the ingredients used in previous films are inserted from the little girl being tossed into the lake to the blind man who takes pity on the monster.

It takes a new turn when the monster in a rage kills a police officer who was trying to arrest him and killed the monsters only friend, his dog. Once in custody the other officers are unsympathetic to his plight or his apparent low level of intelligence, instead beating him nearly to death. On the way to a new jail cell an officer gets off course, releases the monster from the back of the transport and shoots him in the head, leaving him for dead. But of course the monster cant be killed and he seeks first vengeance and then the family that abandoned him.

The quality of the production itself here is quite good with a nice job of cinematography along with some decent performances. Where it lacks first off is the script that seems to take far too long to have things happen. That may have worked in the original film but with the majority of the world already familiar with the tale it just makes this story meander at times. Its difficult to explain but the movie for the most part just seems to exist for no other reason than to exist, offering nothing new to the story with the exception of location and how the monster is created. The pacing is such that the movie actually takes a compelling story and makes it more boring than you could imagine.

Realizing the hard work that goes into the actual production of a movie Im usually not one to slam a film that comes out. In truth there are moments in this one that are worth watching but for the most part those are few and far between and can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If horror films are what you enjoy then you may want to watch this one just to say you have done so. The odds of it being one that youll want to add to your collection are fairly slim. The effort to make a good movie is there but the end result doesnt reach those intentions.",1456876800,,3270,4.334967320261438
7473122,5,B016JB0KGM,"First, on a personal note: Ignore the ""junk movie"" review posted by ""Khaled""---the user either didn't watch or understand the film at all.
Second, this modernization of Shelley's masterpiece is so well written that it could have been placed in the same time period as the book Frankenstein and have been just as great a film. It's really that good.
Third, up to this film, I'd have to say for my own personal tastes I've preferred DeNiro's take on The Monster, slightly more so than Karloff. But, now? Now?! As far as I'm concerned, Xavier Samuel IS Adam. Xavier Samuel IS The Monster. And if and when someone can completely BECOME The Monster, in the same way Heath Ledger BECAME The Joker, well, I'm not holding my breath waiting for that to happen anytime soon...or ever.",1456617600,,774,4.698529411764706
7473123,4,B016JB0KGM,"Do not sell this version of the time honored Frankenstein monster short. Very well written and excellently acted this modernized retelling is nicely done. Having seen every Frankenstein movie out there, this one is the only ""update"" that holds its ground. I felt the helplessness of the creation as only I have felt in the Karloff trilogy. This, as the novel, radiates the purity of the monster thrown into a world that it has had no time to understand, constantly feared, and unable to fathom humanity's hatred of him. I liked this movie very much and found it a welcome addition to the long line of Frankenstein features! If you really enjoy the Mary Shelly novel, yet hold the Karloff monster in a special place in your heart, I believe you too will enjoy this motion picture.",1456531200,,779,4.693430656934306
7473124,4,B016JB0KGM,"This is a modern day setting for the classic Frankenstein tale, including the little girl and blind man. Adam is artificially created and narrates in very intelligent first person, a level of intellect he never really achieves in the film.  He is left for dead a few times and is abused by the system which sees his skin lesion deformity as ugly. The film is not a real horror or science fiction thriller, but a drama that makes us look at how society, especially our law enforcement, treats the mentally ill and how society marginalizes those who are different. Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of the theme is that the director/script writer felt he needed to inform his audience verbally what he was attempting to do visually. This made the film unnecessarily preachy when he had succeeded visually. Sometimes less is more.

Now for what it was, Xavier Samuel nailed the role as ""The Monster"" and certainly deserves top billing for his lead and performance. Won't appeal to those looking for a sci-fi horror thriller or fans of the LAPD.

8736542,3,B016JB0KGM,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Frankenstein released by Alchemy Studios in 2016.

This version of Frankenstein is sort of a modern remake of the classic story by Mary Shelley. It takes bits and pieces from the first two Frankenstein movies, Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. But really, it's not that similar. Dr. Frankenstein takes a back seat to the 'monster' in this version. Overall, Dr. Frankenstein only gets a few minutes of screen time (seemed like 10 minutes or so, but maybe it was a bit more.)

'Frankenstein' is a decent movie and you won't be bored. It has it's problems, which I will elaborate on below, but if you are a horror movie fan watching this movie is not a bad way to spend an evening. Thus, my 3 star rating.
It's, at times, interesting and at other times a bit illogical, even given the fantastical nature of the material filmed. But it you 'suspend disbelief' for a while you should enjoy it.
This movie is not for the squeamish. I found myself turning away from the screen several times. It is very bloody but not in your typical 'slasher' horror movie way which despite the gore, you always know it's all fake. Many of the scenes involve needles and surgical tools which for me are hard to watch.

Oddly enough, while viewing this movie, it reminded me quite often of another movie that has nothing to do with this genre.  That movie is 'The Passion of the Christ.' That statement will probably sound odd and you most likely won't hear anybody else say that. But if you've seen 'The Passion of the Christ' by Mel Gibson then you will know how agonizing it was to watch that movie. It was painful to watch Jesus being beaten and tortured continuously. I felt the same way during this movie. It was painful to watch the 'monster' being brutally beaten throughout (in addition to him doing some of the beating.)

***Spoilers Ahead***

This version is far more fantasy than science fiction. 'Frankenstein' doesn't spend very much time explaining how the 'monster' is brought to life. At the open of the movie he is being created or 'born' as a young adult. The 'monster' is extremely difficult to kill despite the fact that he is believed to be dead and left for dead several times. He appears to be human like and has all normal human functions but when his body parts and organs are severely damaged it doesn't seem to have any effect. He is shot several times including a bullet to the head but that doesn't seem to do anything other than to knock him temporarily unconscious. The movie is inconsistent with regard to this sort of thing. For instance he has a pulse but when his pulse stops he is still alive. So what then is the purpose of having a heart?

I did not like the narration and felt that it was out of place. I'm not sure what happened here. Perhaps there was a re-write along the way? Maybe a sequel was planned. The narration is that of perfectly sane and intelligent person. This intelligence is something that the 'monster' never achieves in the movie. By the end he just basically kills himself or at least attempts to (this is not clear as the movie ends.) So either the script originally called for the creature to become more intelligent and they cut it short or a sequel was planned (or it was a poorly written script without much thought given to plausibility.)

I felt that there were quite a few scenes where people acted in a very unrealistic way.
I doubt very much the police would arrest a person, see that he is obviously mentally retarded or deranged, in a severely beaten and/or diseased state and then take him outside somewhere and shoot him in the head even if he had killed a cop. At least that is my opinion.
I doubt you would find very many attractive prostitutes that would agree to sleep with a person who looks like he had a severely diseased face(just look at the cover of the DVD) and take the word of blind hobo that there was nothing wrong with him.
Frankenstein himself seemed to have absolutely no interest in keeping the 'monster' alive or studying him even after he returned to the laboratory. Certainly there would have been some sort of scientific curiosity about how he managed to find his way there and how is was even alive after they pronounced him dead. Instead he was just interested in cutting his head off. This seemed unrealistic along with terrifically 'klutzy' way in which he accidentally kills his fellow scientist and lover.

Overall, despite my criticism's this is a decent movie.
Recommended for fans of Frankenstein movies and horror movie buffs in general.",1499558400,,4569,4.596319018404908
8736543,4,B016JB0KGM,"Let me tell you that this updated version of ""Frankenstein"" will not be for everyone. The movie begins just as the creature is waking up. We have the celebrations etc but we see he is a virtual child and has to be bottle fed etc. The interesting selection of Xavier Samuel and the Creature is excellent, so handsome to start and then comes the  cellular degeneration. They decide to destroy this flawed creation and well.....you see what comes from that. We still have the little girl by the lake and we have the blind man, too. I am a fan of Xavier and really hope that he comes into his own soon, he dies a fine job here. Then we have Danny Huston as the doctor and Carrie ann Moss as his "" assistant"" The real star here is Xavier and the rest are probably highly paid dressing. by no means is this groundbreaking or even innovative, it takes place now and that is about it.",1485216000,,876,4.27710843373494
8736544,4,B016JB0KGM,This is a good movie. It's a slow burn but overall I liked it.,1464652800,,62,3.5
8736545,4,B016JB0KGM,"Very well done! I think Mary Shelley would have been proud. The beginning seemed a little amateurish, (the lab scene) but other then that it was pretty good movie. What would it be like if the Frankenstein monster was created today and was let loose in the streets of Los Angeles. If the monster was wearing a L.A. Dodgers cap and a Raider jersey I think most of the people would have left him alone,but he wasn't so he got messed with. Xavier Samuel did a great acting job as the monster,(Excellent!). The movie has the lake scene with the little girl and the scene with the blind man, the ending was good and made you feel remorse for the monster. If you loved the movie Victor Frankenstein do not watch this movie it is beyond your caliber. This is a very good Frankenstein movie only meant for the purest of heart.",1462838400,,818,4.3881578947368425
8736546,4,B016JB0KGM,"First off,I'm a huge Xavier Samuel fan. I think he's gorgeous. But he's not exactly eye candy in this adaptation of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein,as he plays the monster. Who starts out beautiful but mutates very quickly into a hideous state.

 This film pretty much plays out like the original with the exception that it's set in the present and it's seen from the perspective of the Monster (Samuel).It's quite  violent with lot's of blood and some well done practical gore effects. The mutating creature effects were done nicely as well.

The cast is top notch, featuring, Tony Todd as (Eddie the blind man) Carrie Ann Moss & Danny Huston as (Maria & Viktor Frankenstein) and Xavier Samuel as (Adam\The Monster).

The running time seemed to fly by very quickly. That's how I know I'm really enjoying a film. I think letting us see the monster looking so beautiful and somewhat helpless in the beginning was smart because it humanized and endeared him to us ""the audience"".

The Frankenstein's ""Much to Maria's dismay and horror ""thought they had destroyed the monster but he didn't die and set out for the streets of L.A..Where he meets and encounters good and bad .You will find yourself rooting for him because it's as if we see him born and care for his well being.

If you like the concept of Frankenstein but want to see it in a new light ,I think you'll enjoy this film. If  an Xavier Samuel fan then it's a must see also.",1461888000,,1428,4.616600790513834
8736547,5,B016JB0KGM,"First of all I would disregard the ""review"" by Mark Turner which is overly generalized and superficial. This updating of the ""Frankenstein"" story is now set in the contemporary world of Los Angeles. It begins with the ""birth"" of the ""Monster"" whose name is ultimately revealed, appropriately enough, as Adam (there is absolutely no mention of the name Frankenstein anywhere in the movie). Xavier Samuel (Newcastle, Anonymous, Adore, A Few Best Men, Twilight) is a magnificent and too often overlooked young Australian actor (when is he going to be nominated for an Academy Award?!) who plays the titular role with sensitivity and credibility in this latest version of the Shelley classic. He deserves an A just for having to undergo the applied makeup to his face and body in order to show his deteriorating state. He also has to endure a great deal of physical punishment.

As Adam ""awakens"" to his new life, we see an exquisitely pristinely beautiful young man (XS is well cast for the part) who is like a one year old in an adult's body. He has to be fed with a bottle by Carrie-Anne Moss who is one of a couple responsible for his
creation in a specialized scientific lab. The ""new born"" begins to call her mom in one tender and moving moment. The chief Dr. bears the solitary name Victor, a nod to the original, and one of his associates is named Dr. Pretorius as in the original - a nice touch. It isn't too long before a major problem develops. Adam begins to break out in boils and lesions over his face and body.  Something has gone seriously wrong and cannot be reversed. A decision is made to kill Adam who is now virtually indestructible with the strength of 10. The effort is a total failure with considerable destructive fallout. Adam escapes the lab and begins an odyssey in his newly discovered world. Adam also becomes our narrator to his story (the film actually opens with his narration). With another nod to the original, he meets a young girl of around 5 and misconstrues a message she is trying to convey. The result is disastrous and the misunderstanding and rush to judgement on the part of onlookers sets into motion a terrible sequence of events. An intolerant and impatient policeman compounds the situation which ultimately takes on a life of its own (was this meant to be a commentary on contemporary behavior in America?). Adam narrowly escapes and continues his wandering. In the process, he comes upon a blind man (another nod to the classic) who is also a part time musician. The difficulty in adjusting to the world around him - Adam is indeed a stranger in a strange land - and the inevitable ramifications makes up the balance of the movie which concludes with a complicated and complex reunion between Adam and his creators. This ""Frankenstein"" is a thought provoking commentary on our present day society. Adam is now Everyman, having to endure being ""the other"" and the innate hostility that goes with that label. Frankenstein is indeed a timeless story and this version proves it.  Highly recommended.

As an aside, it is instructive and more than of passing interest to compare this ""Frankenstein"" as played by Xavier Samuel and the ""Monster"" as seen in Penny Dreadful.",1461369600,2,3210,4.757630161579892
8736548,3,B016JB0KGM,"First, the movie version which most closely follows the famous novel is the 2005 production starring Luke Goss and Donald Sutherland. This version attempts to tell the story in the modern world of the early 21st century, bring the novel forward 200 years. It quite a few ways, it does succeed. Instead of piecing the creature together from dead bodies, the new version is ""grown"" in a lab with what appears to be a 3D printer of sorts.  Many of the scenes from the novel and some of the movies are replicated, including the little girl by the water, and the blind man befriending the creature, the fear induced in most people by the creatures extreme ugliness, and a mob of people with various weapons overpowering the creature and bringing it, in chains, to justice. In the novel the creature is ugly but highly intelligent, superior to humans in physical speed, agility and strength and eventually learns to read and speak with eloquence. In this film, it's the lumbering, brain-damaged brute of the 1931 film. By the end of the film, it has barely learned to speak coherently. Nearly perfect physically when first made, and mentally a blank slate, slight imperfections in the cell-replication mechanism cause it to physically degenerate over time. The disparity between hos the creature is depicted in the novel and in this film is even more striking when the voice of the creature is heard in a voice-over, and it sounds very intelligent, much more so than at any time when actually on screen.
While the film doesn't follow the novel fully, it's no worse than many other films in that respect and better than quite a few. The portrayal of the creature, as well as Dr. Frankenstein and Elizabeth (Carrie Ann Moss) are all good. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, and in this, the movie succeeds in bring back the sense of horror which may have been felt by the first readers of the novel, or the first viewers of the 1931 film. Modern audiences have been jaded by decades of horror and action movies. By presenting this old story in modern terms, it is refreshed and becomes unsettling again.",1461024000,,2098,4.701086956521739
8736549,2,B016JB0KGM,"I rarely review movies unless I really like them or really hate them I saw all of the positive reviews and watched the trailer which I thought looked pretty good so I decided to pick this up. I ended up not liking this movie at all. There are multiple errors that I have noticed from the very beginning (e.g. a camera shot is supposedly POV from the monster's perspective with eyelids closing and that view doesn't match up with the way the actors are looking at the monster in other shots. It might be nit-picky but it's very distracting. Another example is when the monster goes through a door and up a stairwell; the door starts to close behind him as the camera is following but it clearly opens back up by someone just off camera so that the camera could continue the shot.) The acting is very bad and the screenplay is awful too. Some scenes are forced and out of place (e.g. tractor scene) in order to throwback to the original Frankenstein. CGI is bad enough nowadays but is even more distracting when it looks horrible such as in here (especially the final shot).

These are just my personal opinions and am writing this just as a heads-up to others interested in it.",1459209600,,1176,4.469767441860465
8736550,5,B016JB0KGM,"This was a beautiful and sad movie. You really feel for monster, and how much he suffers from not understanding.  He is hurt by people he loves and just doesn't undestand the world but he learns fast what is kind and what is not.  It really is a great movie. I loved it, and I'm really not a drama fan but this read a really touching and pulling movie. It keeps you wanting more.",1457308800,3,379,4.108108108108108
