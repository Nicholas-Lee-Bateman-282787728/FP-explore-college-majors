1342080,4,B00004RESV,This was one of the best pay per view that i have ever seen  the main event was ok the suicide 6 man m atch was a great match iit should have been longer sting scott steiner proved that both are tough. The worst match on this card is the hardcore title match nothing special no suplexes or anything. This pay per view should be bought,1028073600,,334,4.0606060606060606
1342081,5,B00004RESV,"I saw this PPV event and it was the first since Russo and Bishoff debuted the ""NEW WCW"" in April of 2000. I miss WCW, and I'm mad that they're gone, but this event was a good one. With Russo booking, the events are exciting, more entertaining and interesting. However, why the hell are WCW videos 34 dollars and 60 dollars! Those prices are completely ridiclous!",999993600,,362,4.5
1342082,4,B00004RESV,"All the matches were well done. The Title Finals were awesome and
Kimberly shocked the world by turning on her husband and giving
Jarrett the World title. One of the Better ones in recent memory and that's saying something. The Matches with no foundation were kept mercifully short. The best part was seeing Hogan come out and deliver a beating on Kidman.",999129600,,355,4.741935483870968
1342083,1,B00004RESV,"Between Russo and the New Blood, the WCW has turned into a real soap opera!  I thought the nwo was stupid but they have gone far beyond that now!  They have also edited out even the mildest of language from the video making it a blip....blip....blip....  The announcers do not even bother to cover the match anymore.  They are too busy following the story line in the script written for them.  Whatever happened to wrestling matches anyway?  On top of all of this they have the nerve to charge nearly twice as much as the WWF for their videos, never really understood this one????
Should they ever decide to dump Russo and get back to reality I may try WCW again.  I am afraid of the next story line as it would probably be even worse than this one.  This video does not deserve the 1 star I gave it but you cannot rate it a ""0"".",972172800,,829,4.235668789808917
1342084,3,B00004RESV,"This was one of the best WCW payperviews ever! The only problem with the video is that it is edited very strictly. Anything even remotely profane has been removed and that kind of takes away from the ""live"" feel of the event. Still it is great to watch. The matches are well done and filled with intense high energy. Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff made quite a great creative team!",971481600,3,380,4.442857142857143

7920763,3,B00004RESV,"WCW hits the rest button after an interminable three months of Sid as champion, massive roster losses, and the main event they were advertising in 1994 in hopes of fighting the once prosperous ship. Spring Stampede often has the reputation as being the last good WCW event, and while it is a huge improvement over anything we had been given in the previous year, this still isn't great.

The card featured approx. 14 matches, which is an absurd number, and focused on crowning all new champions as most of the titles were vacated during the rest. There were some interesting debuts around this time and numerous new stories were started pitting you get superstars against more established names. Outside of Survivor Series 1998, this probably the best show that shows Russo booking in a positive light.

Since there are so many matches, I'll just hit the highlights:

Mike Awesome had his PPV debut here and wrestled two matches that got over his high impact style and planted seeds for a feud with Nash. All of this was squandered later on, but, for right now, Awesome looked Awesome.

Sting put his work boots on in the US Title tournament, facing Vampiro, Booker T, and Scott Steiner in three good matches. He also put over Steiner strong, which made Scott look like a star.

DDP and Jeff Jarrett wrestled a solid main event that had a nice swerve at the end to keep the feud going.

Booker T got a good push as a young gun that didn't want to disrespect the veterans or take the easy way to the top. Despite his early elimination, you could tell he was one of the young guys poised to be at the top of the card.

Hulk Hogan got involved in a new storyline with Billy Kidman that made the latter seem more important than ever before. Again, this would be squandered, but it looked good on the night!

There some other developments but, to me, these are the reasons to watch the show. Worth picking up for old fans that have bitter-sweet memories of WCW in its dying days.",1407024000,,1974,4.525280898876405

7920765,4,B00004RESV,"My trip down ""WCW lane"" continues here at Spring Stampede 2000.  This was one of the most important PPV's in WCW history as the company was ""relaunched"" the previous Monday Nitro with all previous champions stripped of their belts, all previous storylines were dropped, and the beginning of the ""Millionaries Club vs. New Blood"" angle which was the established veterans (Hogan, Flair, Luger, Sting, Nash) against the up & coming young stars (Douglas, Steiner, Kidman, Bagwell, Vampiro, Awesome) lead by Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo.  So this PPV was full of various matches & tournament to crown new WCW Champions.  Also WCW instituted a new policy where the referee's ""relaxed"" the disqualification rule so you'll get an ECW-like atmosphere where wrestlers are able to to do more than they can usually get away with.

Team Package vs. Mamalukes & Harris Brothers - This was a match in the tag team tournament as Team Package (Luger & Flair) had the deck stacked against them to make it an ""even playing field.""  Flair wrestled in his normal clothes (polo shirt, slacks, dress shoes) and was just a brawl for the most part with Team Package overcoming the odds to advance to the finals.

Jimmy Hart vs. Mancow - For those that don't know, Mancow is a popular radio DJ & this match was just to get a celebrity appearence as it was nothing past a comedic match between the two with the bigger issue here being Kidman's attack on Jimmy Hart after the match.

Scott Steiner vs. The Wall - Short match & nothing noteworthy here past the ending where Steiner picked up the DQ victory for Wall chokeslamming the referee through the table.

Mike Awesome vs. The Cat vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Mike Awesome got into a backstage confrontation earlier in the night with Bam Bam Bigelow which led to Bigelow taking out The Cat, Awesome's scheduled opponent, right before this match.  For the most part, this was just Awesome showing his ability to do quick crusierweight moves as a heavyweight before The Cat came back & danced during the middle of the match (with even the announcers questioning why that was happening) before Awesome got the win & moved on.

Shane Douglas & Buff Bagwell vs. Harlem Heat 2000 - For those who don't know/remember, Harlem Heat 2000 was Stevie Ray, Big T (WWE's Ahmed Johnson) with Mr. Biggs (WWE's Clarence Mason) as their manager & Kash (4x4 from the No Limit Soliders group in 1999) as their bodyguard.  This match was real short & sloppy with nothing noteworthy past the beginning of the breakup of the Harlem Heat group.

Sting vs. Booker - This was a back & forth match that, again, was quick but still a good encounter between the two that showed each man earning each other's respect in the end.

Vampiro vs. Billy Kidman - This was a athletic encounter between the two but the bigger story here was Hulk Hogan appearing to attack Kidman's for his actions on the previous Nitro (including ramming a Hummer into Hogan's limo) for Vampiro to get the victory.  Afterwards, Hogan went after Bischoff in his locker room before Russo got the police to arrest Hogan & take him out of the building.

Hardcore Title Match: Terry Funk vs. Norman Smiley - This was more of a comedic hardcore match than a serious one as Norman Smiley kept running away from Terry Funk for most of the match...to the point where Norman was hiding in the bathroom at the start of the match while everyone backstage was stooging off where Norman was.  You got your typical weaponsfest here before Dustin Rhodes' interference backfired & had Funk win the WCW Hardcore Championship.

Scott Steiner vs. Mike Awesome - For the short time they were together, they come off as working a little bit stiff with each other back & forth before Kevin Nash got his reciept on Awesome helping Steiner advance to the finals.

Sting vs. Vampiro - This was the one match both men wanted in the tournament as it was a very physical match for the short time it had with Sting advancing to the finals.

WCW Crusierweight Title Match: Crowbar vs. Juventud Guerrera vs. Shannon Moore vs. The Artist Formely Known As Prince Iaukea vs. Chris Candido vs. Lash Leroux - This match had an usual start as 3 Count kept signing their song until all the other challengers ran down to the ring as they couldn't take it anymore.  This was your typical fast-paced crusierweight match with even the managers/valets (David Flair, Daffney, Shane Helms) getting involved before it came down to Chris Candido getting the victory over ""The Artist"" with help from Tammy Lynn Sytch (formely WWE's Sunny)...which led to a catfight between her & Paisley (Booker T's current wife, Sharmell).

WCW Tag Team Title Match: Team Package vs. Shane Douglas & Buff Bagwell - Before I get started, if your sensitive to uncensored language then mute the TV because everyone was cussing up a storm here from the wrestlers like Shane Douglas (""F' You Flair!"") to even the announcers like Tony Schavonie (""Bullsh...!"").  This was a back & forth match between both teams with the surpize debut of Kronik along with Russo getting involved lead to the New Blood team of Douglas & Bagwell winning the tag team titles.

WCW United States Title Tournament Final: Sting vs. Scott Steiner - Another back & forth match here & the best match in the tournament outside of Sting vs. Booker.  This was actually given time to build up to something before the big swerve came with Vampiro coming from under the ring to get Sting & help Scott Steiner win the United States Championship.

WCW World Title Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match started off with a bang as they fought through the crowd before making their way to the ring with Jarrett working over DDP's injured back & Page's fighting back for the honor of his wife Kimberly (who Jarrett knocked out earlier in the week).  Eric Bischoff was in the isleway observing the match & looked like he was helping out DDP by distracting the referee at first...but it was a setup for Kimberly to turn on DDP & aid Jarrett in finally winning a World Championship.

In the end, this was the most unpredictable & exciting WCW PPV in some time as the booking wasn't too out of control (unlike how it was with Russo before & would get later on) but with trying to shove all the tournament/vacancy matches together in one short time, the wrestling quality wasn't as good as it could have been put still a strong WCW PPV I would recommend for a viewing.",1221868800,2,6436,4.677590788308238
7920766,5,B00004RESV,"This is last ppv event for Spring Stampede. This ppv totally switched up the story lines for a way to bring up the ratings, which well you know failed.

7920767,5,B00004RESV,"I said it before and I'll say it again, I love tournaments. The Jeff Jarrett-DDP match was one of the few good matches of 2000 by WCW standards. There were many good/solid matches in between. The only match I didn't like was the 2 on 4 handicap match.other then that, I liked the video. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1189641600,,317,4.0476190476190474
7920768,5,B00004RESV,"I'm not one of those wrestling fans who analyses things detail for detail.  I like just about anything and I call it how I see it.  WCW for many months leading up to this show had gotten incredibly stupid and boring.  It had some moments but otherwise it was a joke.  When Vince Russo came back to WCW for the 2nd time.  He got almost complete control and for 3 months gave WCW fans some of the most interesting and exciting stuff they hadnt seen for years.  I am not a fan of Vince Russo style as a whole but I cant argue with this tape here.  The peak of the russo era as far as I am concerned.  It was crash tv (or should I say PPV) everything moved at a fast pace.  They changed up styles.  And it just made things more exciting.  I highly recommend that you find a way to check this ppv/home video out.  You'd be surprised just how good it is.  The live crowd is hot.  Always a good thing.  Theres a few bad matches in the card.  But with a card with as many matches as this.  Thats not alot at all.  Do note that this video does have some editing of the cursing used throughout the ppv.  It's not too bad though.  The main event between DDP and JARRETT was one of the best main events WCW had since 1998, without question.  Watch it!",1086220800,6,1239,4.037190082644628
7920769,4,B00004RESV,"Debut of the ""new wcw"". Best PPV with Bischoff and Russo in charge. There are too many matches but they're kept short thankfully. We see the debut of Mike Awesome,and Kronic on a ppv. The better matches were Booker T vs Sting, and The suicide 6-way. DDP vs Jarrett was pretty good. Mancow vs Jimmy Hart was horrendous. There was too much interference but some of it was entertaining. Good to see the heels dominate a ppv. But its too expensive,you shoud just buy it off ebay.",1028073600,3,475,4.471264367816092
