8063562,3,B0009NSAR8,"First of all, note that this is a Region 2 DVD, and requires a region free DVD player. Anybody checking this title out is probably already aware of that, but it can't hurt to mention it. Something else to be aware of, this DVD does not have the usual assortment of subtitles I typically find on European DVDs. In fact, this DVD has no subtitles at all. If you don't speak German, you, like me, will be out of luck.  It looks as though the 1935 English remake, ""First A Girl"" is a pretty close remake, making much of the movie at least somewhat guessable even without knowing the language. Still, too bad about the subtitles, wish that thought had occurred to me before I held the DVD in my hand.

The print is good. It is not restored, has lots of dust spots, but is relatively sharp and with decent contrast. Audio is a bit tinny, and seems to me just a hare out of sync, it almost gives the feeling of being dubbed after the fact. I will say that Renate Muller makes a very unconvincing man, but so do Jessie Mathews and Julie Andrews in the later versions. Willing suspension of disbelief required to accept that the characters in the film are so easily fooled!",1420588800,5,1164,4.334862385321101
8063563,5,B0009NSAR8,"I welcome any opportunity to see the great Anton Walbrook on film.  And of course this film has historical interest both due its subject matter (especially as the inspiration for Julie Andrews/James Garner/Robert Preston film ""Victor/Victoria"") and the times in which it was made (if Wikipedia can be believed, co-star Renate Muller had a rather dreadful death likely due to the Nazis).  As a musical, it's not quite up to Hollywood standards.  And it's also odd to watch a film that's entirely sung in verse:  Opera and Shakespeare are one thing, but one tends to expect more natural spoken dialogue in such a modern setting.  But I was very glad I purchased this DVD.",1382918400,,669,4.833333333333333
8063564,5,B0009NSAR8,"I adore this film, and to get it with English subtitles (I speak only a dozen words of Wagner/Hogan's Heroes German)is beyond delight. Reel 2 is still missing from this print, but anyone who has seen the English remake, First a Girl, or the Hollywood version, Victor and Victoria, will know what happened in Viktor's furnished room. Especially wonderful with the English titles is the irony of the anthem sung by the down and out vaudevillians as they descend the stairs from the booking agent's office. Marching down, down, down, they sing about their hopes for the future: ""ever upward, ever upward."" Renate Mueller is utterly adorable. Her mysterious death under the Nazis was a great loss.

It is fascinating to see which features of this production were repeated in the English and American versions. The Spanish number is in all three. The geese make it to England, but not Hollywood. Etc. It is also fascinating to note that neither the German nor British versions hint at the slightest relationship between female impersonators and homosexuality. It was simply a given feature of stage life then, like Blackface and mother songs.",1373932800,3,1137,4.984210526315789
