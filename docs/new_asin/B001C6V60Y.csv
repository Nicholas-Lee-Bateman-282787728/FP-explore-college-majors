You will never regret that decision. The Pigua dvd is well done. Having been exposed to Pigua/Baji in my youth, this is very well done. It filled in a few gaps from my previous training. Multiple angles. The demonstrations are on par as a supplement to training as it should be. If you have Northern Shaolin experience, you can learn the basic from disk. You will still need a Sifu for tweeking and fine tuning. But you will have a very solid showing of the material",1438819200,,625,4.6909090909090905
