8368463,3,B000JHKUS6,"I guess i had hoped for more basics & realistic encounter drills (self-defense wise).
But on the other hand, this dvd does offer a multitude of drills for you to follow.  Many examples are given from different camera angles so as to not confuse you when you try to copy what you are watching.  The instructor is excellent at carrying across what he's doing by showing you it's application on the wooden dummy as well as in partner drills.  But there is the problem. I felt left wanting since he didn't show but a few of the techniques as to how they would be applied in a self-defense scenario.
On a separate note, he is not a wing chun instructor or master of any kind.  I have heard him on Paladin's podcast and read in an interview in Black Belt magazine where he does not claim to be such either.  He does claim to have working thorough knowledge of how to use the mook jong which he demonstrates masterfully.  (Joesph Simmonet doesn't BS you into thinking he's something he's not.  Unlike Master Wong with his Wing Chun dvd.  For more on this, check out my review on Master Wong's ""Wing Chun-Fighting Art"" dvd - waste of time.)

Overall, ""Extreme Wing Chun"" lives up to it's advertisement as a dvd of drills.  If that's what you want, then you will be happy.  If you were looking for more fundamentals or chi sao training, do not order this dvd.",1364947200,7,1350,4.425101214574899
