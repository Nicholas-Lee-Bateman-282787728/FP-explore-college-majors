8585530,5,B00CS3P912,The episodes in this series are quite interesting.  The program is engaging and thought provoking in many ways.  It is great to use segments of the episodes as part of a training series I conduct.  The segments prompt discussion and the audience enjoy listening/watching the show's host for a few minutes!,1429228800,,305,4.9411764705882355

8585533,5,B00CS3P912,"This is a fantastic video.  I saw it on a United Airlines flight and thought to myself:""Boy, if a person does not watch this by the age of 18, he is going to miss out on a lot of things in life"".  This video talks about the core elements of success and happiness, such as IQ, EQ, procrastination (strategic waiting), persistence, goal defining, etc.  Very entertaining but also thought provoking.",1383696000,5,396,4.628571428571429
8585534,5,B00CS3P912,"So, that dude on the cover is not Dan whatever-his-last-name-is. That's Jake Porway. Totally different guy, and the show features him. Not Dan whatever-his-last-name-is. It's also about stats, and junk. Or like how you can live longer by drinking booze, or having really strong hands (possibly also strong elbows). Anyway, it's a fun show. You'd like it. I swear.",1376352000,4,363,5.169491525423729
