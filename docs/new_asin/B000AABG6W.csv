8077184,4,B000AABG6W,"This is a VCI DVD-R Range Busters Double Feature with quite good quality overall.  ""Saddle Mountain Roundup"" looks very good with only one big problem.  There is one very bad dialogue splice about halfway through the film.  I have seen this film on archive.org where that scene is perfect, but there are other dialogue splices.  These people that supposedly love classic film really don't seem to care about the crap they put out.  I guess I will have to make my own DVD's so that I can watch many of these films the way they should be.  By using 2 or 3 sources, they could easily make a complete film out of many that desperately need it.  Instead they just seem to use any old source they can dig up.  ""Wrangler's Roost"" also looks good with no bad dialogue splices(just a little dark at the start).  Both released by Monogram in 1941, it is a joy to see the original beginning and ending credits.",1356998400,,899,4.432926829268292
