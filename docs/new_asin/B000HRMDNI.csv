8140921,4,B000HRMDNI,"While this DVD is mostly about angels it does discuss near-death experiences in detail. I will say this, we should not confuse demons, ghosts and spirits with angels. One woman on this DVD implies that when people talk to angels they may be talking to these other entities. What struck me as especially important was the way angels saved people from disaster by various means. Those stories were especially real and vivid. What you might not expect to learn about however is what it feels like to go to hell. One woman tells her story of suicide and the horror of emotional distress while in a dark forboding place. There she was given a chance to see her life and to return to take care of her family. Throughout the DVD there are sections which describe heavenly angels and their role in biblical stories. So this was not exactly a happy movie about angels. It is more about people in distress who are helped by heavenly beings.
