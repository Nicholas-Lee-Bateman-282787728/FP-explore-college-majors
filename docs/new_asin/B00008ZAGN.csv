8489533,5,B00008ZAGN,"The best hitting video I have seen.  I am a coach and teach little league hitting but have been a high school coach as well.  I knew a bit about the rotational style of hitting and how it claims to be better for average and power but I was blown away by this video.  The video footage reinforced the coaches teaching and made it fun for my kids to watch and learn.  Some of the little league and high school kids were even hitting in major league parks.  They went to great lengths to explain how the swing differed and it was not just a coach talking. Each point had live, slowmotion or still shots to show how the swing worked.  It smoothly went thru a great music type video of how the swing actually works, which was fun for the kids to watch. Then he went thru the steps and finally drills and hitting.  I also contacted the producer and found they have a web site that featured drills and techniques. Again the best video I have seen and a real sleeper. Great video quality as well.
