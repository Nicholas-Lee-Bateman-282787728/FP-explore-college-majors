8720027,5,B00ZFOUHVI,"This is the latest in the series of DVD releases from VAI of musicals which aired on TV in the 1950s under the title ""Max Liebman Presents"" and - at least for me - is one of the most entertaining. How can it not be entertaining? With a cast of Hollywood musical stars like Dan Dailey, Broadway veterans like the gutsy Helen Gallagher and Jack Whiting (who gets to perform the Arlen-Harburg song ""Down With Love"" which he introduced on Broadway in 1937) and a dozen or more songs composed by the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Sammy Cahn, Vernon Duke and the aforementioned Arlen/Harburg team, this is a musical theater fan's dream show. And it is all packed into 76 minutes!

Did I forget dance numbers? There must be at least a half-dozen of them with all the cast involved. Rod Alexander did the choreography.

Luckily these shows were filmed when they aired and have been preserved for us to see over and over again. While there is no damage to the print used, the contrast (this is black and white, remember) is not strong. But the images are otherwise clear and the sound is great!

As noted in the brief scenario on the back of the package, this show was created by playwright Neel Simon and William Freidberg in just three weeks (when a Vernon Duke musical that was originally scheduled ran in to copyright issues) with the writers crafting a script that would interpolate popular songs into the score. Simon and music director Irvin Kostal wrote the song that closes the show.  By the way, preview VIA DVDs have included short essays on the inserts - which I always enjoyed - but none are here this time. Just an index to the ""chapters"" so you can jump to your favorite musical numbers on repeat viewing.

I won't even go into the plot (think of any Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly musical and you get the idea), because it really doesn't matter. It's the music performances (more than half the screen time that you'll want to see.

This was a commercially sponsored (by Oldsmobile) show on NBC. As in previews releases, VAI has excised the 5 commercials and provided them (about 10 minute's worth) as a ""bonus feature"".

If you love old musicals, great songs and dancing, this is really an essential purchase.

Now to dream of what VAI has up its sleeve for the next Max Liebman Presents DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful
