1398272,1,B000056MOF,"At first it might not have seemed like such a bad idea to remake this movie again. Afterall the story of Annie Sullivan teaching Helen Keller communication is timeless and the 1979 version does prove that remakes can still work. So, if they had to do another one two decades later, why cast the Pepsi Girl in the coveted role as Helen?? I read a review that said her emotionless performance should be nicknamed ""Frankenkeller"", because she does indeed walk around like a robot! The only good thing about her performance is that she doesn't talk in the film! She is also too graceful a Helen. Patty Duke, and even Melissa Gilbert had a more wild animal like energy to their performances, while Ms. Pepsi seems bored as Helen (or is it that we are just bored at watching her? Would someone give her a Pepsi, please?? I was totally shocked that she didn't start singing at the pivotal water pump scene ""The Joy of Wa-Wa""! However, she didn't say anything at all! Where is the emotional wallup that that scene has always brought to us?!
On some postive notes: The sets are grand and so are the costumes. Ms. Allison's performance as young fiest Sullivan can almost stand proudly besides Anne Bancroft's Oscar-winning turn as Anne Sullivan and Patty Duke's Emmy-winning interpretation of her. Do yourself a favor and watch the 1962 and 79 versions, ones that didn't rape such a gorgeous tale.",983923200,15,1387,4.688524590163935
1398273,4,B000056MOF,"It is a very good movie, but it was actually different from the old film starring Patty Duke. Hallie did a great job to act as Helen Keller. According to the Story of Helen Keller, Hallie looks like young Helen Keller. It is great!!!!!",981072000,2,235,4.363636363636363
1398274,4,B000056MOF,"In two words, I would say ""Loved it."" It was on ABC a while back, and wished I taped it. I caught the whole thing,and didn't expect it to be good, but really enjoyed it. Now it's finally coming out on tape, and I couldn't be happier. The Pepsi girl (she's a cutie) was very good, being Helen Keller. I read the story of Helen Keller and figured to watch the movie. I'm glad I did. :o)",980553600,,384,4.0
1398284,5,B000056MOF,"The determination and optimism of Anne Sullivan are contagious. And Hallie Kate Eisneberg was superb as Helen Keller. The rest of the cast was also ideal, especially David Strathairn as Captain Keller.",1516492800,,201,5.3125
1398285,4,B000056MOF,"I loved this modern version of the Miracle Worker.  Not an easy part to play for young Hallie, but she really pulls it off.  An amazing story on its own, yet throw in some great acting and you find yourself deep into the story and wanting to know more.  Yes, this movie is a redo of the 1962 version with Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft, but the two are different enough that they can stand on their own.  If you like a true story and a feel good movie, this is one I would highly recommend.",1508630400,,488,4.052083333333333

1398304,5,B000056MOF,Great movie! Riveting account of the difficulties in trying to communicate and teach a child who is both blind and deaf. My kids are fascinated by it and want to watch it over and over again and often play that someone is Helen and someone is Anne Sullivan.,1486598400,,257,4.375
1398305,5,B000056MOF,"My daughter is doing a report on Helen Keller for her second grade project. Much like some of the other reviews conveyed, it's very difficult to explain how difficult life and learning are for a child with these two impairments to an adult let alone a child. This film does it wonderfully. It does keep it at a Disney level, and for obvious reasons there's a lot less singing than you'd expect in a typical Disney movie. Highly recommend this film for classrooms looking to better understand the special needs of those around us.",1486339200,,529,4.638297872340425

1398331,4,B000056MOF,"I purchased this movie to show my class while they were reading a book about Helen Keller. It was difficult for my 2nd grade students to imagine what a deaf and blind child is like. This movie was beautifully done and all of the students were moved by it. My only complaint is that the some of the actors had a difficult time with the southern accent...morphing between southern,  Georgian, and British. This left some of the lines sounding odd or rehearsed and not naturally spoken (particularly those of the Captain and James Keller). All in all, a good movie.",1478563200,,562,4.62
1398332,4,B000056MOF,Very well done. Good depiction.  Scenery is great.  Helps that it's a Disney...an old Disney.,1472428800,,93,5.133333333333334
1398333,5,B000056MOF,"Finally they got the age of Helen more accurate in this Disney version. The real Helen Keller was six years and 8 months when she met Annie Sulliven. The little girl in this movie is 8 years. In the Patty Duke version and Melissa Gilbert version, the actresses that played Helen were too old. (15 and 16). Hallie is such a great little actress.

1398342,5,B000056MOF,In my second grade classroom we read a bout a child who is deaf and what school is like for her. Then we read a story called Through Grandpa's Eyes which is about a boy who learns to see through his blind grandfather's eyes. We then read a story about Helen Keller who is both blind and deaf. (These are stories that are on a second grade level so each child reads the stories and then we read aloud the stories in small groups and discuss them as well as do comprehension activities for each one. To culminate reading all three of these books we watch The Mkracle Worker which gives the students a deeper understanding of what it was like for Helen to be blind and deaf. The students love the stories as well as the movie. It's a wonderful teaching tool!,1461369600,6,755,4.286713286713287

I couldn't get him very interested in the story of Helen Keller and it was with great protest that he watched this movie.  By the end, he loved it and has asked to learn more about Helen Keller and her life.  We watched a video my sister had found of Annie Sullivan with Helen Keller, explaining how she taught her to speak.  It was fascinating.  I have seen several versions of this story and I thought the child actress (who I am sure is grown up now) did a superb job and stole the show.  I'm not sure how closely it followed the actual story - I believe some liberties were made for the sake of story telling, but it was a very enjoyable movie, and also very educational.",1445299200,2,780,4.166666666666667

1398389,5,B000056MOF,"By far the best miracle worker EVER!  Hallie Kate Eisenburg (helen Keller) does such an amazing job playing Halen Keller in this version, her movements, expressions and body language would actually make you believe she is blind, deaf and cant speak! She by far does the greatest job, infelt that in the other to with patty duke playing helen (1962) and melissa gilbert playing helen (1979 the acting and movements wer stiff, hallie does it so smoothley. I also think that the other too (patty duke and melissa gilbert) they looked alittle old to play helen (they were like 12 or 13 and Helen was 7 when Annie came to help her, which hallie was the perfect age), hallie also looks alot like the real helen at that age.

Allison elliot does a great job as annie to, like with hallie the acting is smooth and in the other to versions the acting for annie is stiff. I watch this one over and over!  if you want to watch the miracle worker i would definatly go with this one!",1438560000,,970,4.407821229050279
1398390,3,B000056MOF,"A courageous attempt to remedy the drama with Hellen Keller's original work.  The movie has some realism to add to the story, but I think the original with Patty Duke has a flair and a drama that all its own.  I recommend the original movie, and recommend this production as a companion piece to be viewed on some lonely rainy night, when there is nothing more to do than to experience a more exacting rendition of Helen Keller's account of her own transformation.",1435190400,,464,4.578313253012048

1398411,1,B000056MOF,"From the script to the acting, everything about this movie is just terrible. Helen's parents are perhaps the most convincing actors in this movie - a shame considering they refer to her as a ""burden,"" among other hurtful names. The actress playing Helen completely fails to convince us that she is blind and deaf. Several times throughout the movie, she reacts to changes in light or loud noises, and she seems to know how to navigate places she's never been before without the aid of touch. It's simply not realistic.

Anne's treatment of Helen in this movie is borderline abusive. In one scene, Helen is hostile to Anne and slaps her, to which Anne responds by returning the slap and splashing a pitcher of water in Helen's face. She also physically restrains Helen in ways that wouldn't be safe in real life, and a large part of the movie relies on deceiving Helen by making her believe she is somewhere far away from where her parents are living. When Helen, obviously in distress, indicates that she wants her mother, Anne insists on not telling her that her mother is right there in the room with them. This is supposed to be inspiring? I shudder to think what people are taking away from this movie.",1421020800,,1206,4.635514018691588

1398424,5,B000056MOF,"This latest version of the Helen Keller story was my  8 yr old grand daughters favorite.  I think because it was in color and not so frightening as black and white movies have a different effect.

We both enjoyed all three movies and the story of Helen Keller this past summer. It was like seeing my own granddaughter awake to a sightless existence when she first read the story in 2nd grade.  She was so interested in Helens story.  I first told her to look in up on google with my tablet.  This movie version popped up and we were on our way to research, order from Amazon and watch all three movies.

I truly believe this story of Helen Keller is one of the most humanly inspiring true stories out there that can and will inspire anyone of most ages. My granddaughter covered her eyes and  walked around for many days after to try to understand just how difficult Helen life was.

 One funny moment....when I would call my granddaughter...whether to reprimand or comment...she would throw her hands up and indicate she was also deaf and could not hear me nor see me.  ha

She really took this story to heart and could understand how difficult it was for Helen and her teacher and her family to confront and teach and show love and consequences for her actions.

We all need to refresh those feelings in ourselves. And we all need to take responsibilities for our needs and wants and actions.

This was a great adventure for me and my granddaughter and I will continue to research more information about Helen and Ann Sullivan for my own education and share what I learn with her.",1408579200,,1582,4.486013986013986

1398427,5,B000056MOF,"Obviously, everyone has their personal opinions on which version of The Miracle Worker is the best, the 1960s one, the 1970s one, or this 2000s one. The truth is, when you have such a moving, powerful story as the life of Helen Keller, then it can be filmed many times and each version will have its own quality and value to it. After all, great stories can be told more than once.

This Wonderful World of Disney made-for-television version is lovely and handsome, with a charming ""family film"" quality that makes it a great version for kids, young and old, to view it and understand it. It accurately follows the true story of how Annie Sullivan taught communication to blind, deaf, and dumb Helen Keller. (Any strict comparisons to the stage play, upon which this is based, or the excellent 1960s film are not necessary; after all, if you want to view the 60s film or the stage play, go view them.)

Hallie Kate Eisenberg is perhaps the most underrated little actress on the planet, giving a totally believable and intricate performance as Helen. Just watching her movements and body language in each scene makes you fully believe that she is a blind and deaf child. Patty Duke deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance as Helen Keller in the 60s film. I think Hallie Kate Eisenberg deserves an Emmy for this one! In addition, Hallie Kate is the first screen Helen Keller who is literally the spitting image of the real Helen Keller, both in age and in looks.

Alison Elliott is very real and genuine as the plucky Annie Sullivan, as is the rest of the cast, which includes hard-working character actor David Strathairn as Helen's father. This is a lovely, well-made, believable version of Helen Keller's extraordinary story, and it stands completely on its own in comparison to previous versions. It is highly recommended for families, and could be a great version for children who have not yet heard about Helen Keller.",1406332800,13,1934,4.75

This movie is great just as a movie but when you think about the obstacles that Helen Keller overcame and the way in which she lived her life (with such excellence), the movie becomes something for us to apply to our own lives.  What are the obstacles we are fighting to hold onto and what are the possibilities if we give up the control and learn?  No matter how young or how old we are, there's a lesson in this movie for everyone...or it can just be entertainment for the family.",1399161600,,627,4.279661016949152

1398438,2,B000056MOF,"I was really enjoying this film and felt that they had done an excellent job of remaking a classic. Unfortunately, the ending ruined it for me. I admit that if I had never seen the other versions of this film, I wouldn't have had a problem with the ending. Nonetheless, the scene where Helen figures out that W-A-T-E-R spells 'water' is lacking in clarity and power when compared to the other versions. Patty Duke absolutely rocked that scene when she played Helen; Melissa Gilbert did a creditable job as well. In this Disney remake, the scene is not as good--and I don't fault the child actor for this; I think it is an issue of directing and editing.

The problem is, that scene is the heart of the movie. That scene depicts the crucial moment that set Helen on the path that led to such achievement and renown. That moment is, ultimately, the reason the film exists. So although I could look back on this Disney version and think, ""Well, it was mostly pretty great--it was just the one scene that wasn't so good,"" and give it three stars, I cannot help but to think of this in the wider context of the importance of that scene. That being the case, I can only really give this movie two stars. The acting was excellent, as were so many other aspects of the film, but it missed the mark in the end.

In Moneyball, Brad Pitt's character says, about baseball, that nobody cares about how good a season your team has unless you win the last game of the season. I feel that applies to movies. In baseball, the last game is the most important game not because it's last per se, but because by being last, it determines which team wins the season. The W-A-T-E-R scene is the most important scene in the movie and also happens to be the climactic finish (as is frequently the case with stories and films). The ""Disney 2000 Miracle Worker"" team had a great season, but it lost the championship game, and the disappointment in the end will remain the most memorable part of the experience for me. A commendable effort, but no kewpie doll.",1394582400,,2032,4.474393530997305

For me, and the Freshmen English classes I have taught in the past, this DVD does a good job of bringing Gibson's play to life.  Many of my students are reading below grade level, and it is often hard for them to visualize what is occurring on the page.  Showing the movie transported them back to 1880s Alabama and helped them understand the social context of Keller and Sullivan's remarkable achievement.  Yes, acting at times was a bit caricaturish, but overall DVD helped enhance kids' understanding and appreciation of the story.

Instead of highlighting the central battle of wills between Anne and Helen, it seems to be urging us to feel pity for Helen, the very thing Sullivan was combating within the Keller family.

This version also adds dialogue to emphasize the subplot between Captain Keller and James - the original James was callow and abrasive, but I find this one unbearable.  Overall a beautiful adaptation to look at but lacking a firm directorial vision.",1327017600,,703,4.873949579831932

1398474,3,B000056MOF,"You've gotta hand it to Disney -- they Disneyfie everything they do! Most of the time that's a good thing, but not so much in the case of this movie. The old one starring Patty Duke was much better in the respect of cast. Everyone CLASHED -- and that was a GOOD thing because it was half the conflict, which is a vital ellement in any movie. Also, Patty Duke was a Helen with a broader range of emotion. This new one is 1)Blank, or 2)Sour. And Lucas Black as James?! I like him, but he was NOT the guy for the role. I much prefer the sarcastic, withdrawn, hurting young man in the 1960's movie. He wanted to be loved and accepted for himself, but was much too proud to stoop to whining or openly pointing out his father's favoritism. Yes, these new characters are definately modulated. And, to me, downright bland. Helen's longing for knowledge was better depicted in the old movie, as well as Annie's restless yearning to impart it to her.",1173312000,3,940,4.377142857142857

I agree with another customer that remakes can be better than originals, but I do not think that this remake is.  There is a remarkable performance by the girl playing Helen Keller, but otherwise the acting does not seem as strong.  This movie is both in color and very colorful, which distinctly seems the wrong cinematic choice.  For either version, however, a reading of Hellen Keller's own book, _The Story of My Life_, will help explain what the movie attempts to dramatize, especially the final scene at the water pump.",1171324800,3,654,4.761061946902655

The story itself is so inspiring, and the principal characters are so good, that one can overlook a weak performance or two by supporting cast. The horrors of Anne Sullivan's childhood are whitewashed in this version( ie we don't learn that she was probably molested as in the 1962 film), but her character nevertheless shines through. When Helen's father suggests that perhaps the Lord did not mean for Helen to talk, Miss Sullivans reply-""I mean her to"" resonates through one's being. The bible passage offered as a mealtime grace by the son near the film's conclusion is equally apt- a man wrestling all night with an angel,being wounded in his thigh, and unwilling to let go ""until you bless me"". We understand at once the deeper meaning of the literal wrestling that has constituted much of the film. The story remains a testimony to the human spirit that perseveres.",1151280000,10,949,4.828220858895706
1398479,3,B000056MOF,"wow! i was left speechless after reading the many reviews about the disney remake of the miracle worker. i am a freshman in high school who has been studying ASL (american sign language) and Deaf history for many years. i am appalled at the viewer's reviews, however, i did spend a great deal of time laughing. i have seen both the original and the remake of this movie (havent gotten a hold of the 1979). The original was of course the ultimate. i have never been so impressed with this type of movie before then. I had just watched the sound of fury and i felt that both were fantastic even though i was definitely more partial to the miracle worker. Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan were portrayed beautifully and i distinctly remembered being fascinated with patty's consistency in not moving her eyes, giving away her acting. But you cannot be so hasty in dismissing the disney remake. Of course it will not be completely factual because disney is mainly for heartwarmig movies, not the harsh realities. It was more of a tear jerker only because it was made for children and will not express the same passion, intensity, and insensitivity that was their relationship. Pocahontas is a perfect example. its a pretty story, but not true. they did not live happily ever after. The lion king is also not the best way to explain Hamlet. But you must admit, that for a disney movie, it went just over the line, being honest with the discipline that Sullivan taught Helen. Contrary to your reviews, i very much disagree with Hallie's portrayal af Annie. she was not stiff or to prim and pretty. are you crazy?!? she lived in a time where beauty and perfection were valued highly. a respected member of society like her father was not going to have his daughter looking like an animal, though at the time, she really was, without wanting to. So she was more calm, so what? Being deaf and blind did not mean that she always acted in that fashion. Hallie's resistence was just right for the age group that the movie was really addressing. There was no way that you could have expected this to compare, at all, to the original. impossible. but that the movie was bad or even go far enough to attack their acting, is preposterous. Annie was wonderful. she didn't take the ""pity-pity"" that her family had for her nor did she let her walk away without having learned her lesson. Now, before i end this endless review i want to enlighten those of you who may a little in the dark. Never pity a deaf person. if you have not noticed, Deaf people have created not only their own language, but also a culture. I remember a deaf friend of mine who was pregnant. she was actually hoping for her son to be deaf. who else would want that? someone who is proud of who they were. Helen. when she grew up. travelled with Annie and taught the world about a side of deafness no one knew or didn't want to know. They aren't crazy or less intelligent than any other person. Their one disability was language. Helen overcame that obstacle and became a very intelligent, inspiring, and no less crazy than you or i. my fingers hurt. i hope that you will all read this and not believe the extreme reviews (i love it!-or- i hate it!). i think it is the perfect film that gives children a taste of the story of this exceptional woman. However, at the right maturity level, the original is 100% the best.",1145836800,15,3370,4.508169934640523

This story is based on the true story of Helen Kellar and her remarkable teacher, Annie Sullivan.  The story is beautifully told, depicting on one hand the power struggle of the wills between the two women as Annie seeks to bring language to Helen who doesn't even know what words are and on the other, showing a family's struggle to cope with a challenge they don't understand.  I found certain scenes humourous and others poignant.  The two actors that play Annie and Helen were perfect for the part.  All in all a really good family movie.",1110326400,,738,4.518796992481203

I very much liked this newer version.  Does it lack some of the passion of the original?  Maybe.  But what it may lack in passion, it gains in clarity.  Yes, the storyline is clearer.  The dialogue is easier to understand.  The goals of the characters are more concrete.  The sign language is not as rushed.  The stepson has greater depth. There are fewer rantings and ravings of the original's cartoonish father.  Best of all, I feel like I learned more.

Having read the other reviews I was reluctant to rent this Disney version.  But I am now happy that I did.  And I hope this wonderful story is told and retold by future filmmakers - and I hope I'm around to learn even more about this remarkable student and her teacher.",1109376000,71,971,4.351955307262569
1398485,1,B000056MOF,"I am 14 years old and have been acting singing and dancing since I was tiny. I do a lot of plays at the prestigeous(sp?) Grosse Pointe Theatre. Recentley (last febuary-march) the theatre decided to do William Gibson's play ""The miracle worker"". Of course I wanted to try out and I was desperate to get the role because its been a role I've wanted to play for a long time. I auditioned and ended up getting the part of Helen Keller. For four months we rehearsed and finally performed our 10 straight shows. It was the most rewarding experience of my young life. The standing ovations and tears that I saw every night really made me feel like I was doing justice to this fantastic woman by retelling her wonderful and inspiring story. We had a stunt choregraphor and yes we actually hit,pinched,kicked,and threw water on eachother. I had people telling me that I could give Patty Duke a run for her money (although I believe that noone could ever play the part as well as her)! I've seen all three movie versions and I must say that this movie through crumby acting and choregoraphy proved to be the worst out of all of them. The breakfast fight scene leaves much to be said. For performance after performance we smacked and kicked eachother and got many bruises and cuts. We ended up having to wear kneepads especially in the scene where we smashed the porcelian pitcher all over the stage. This girl (the pepsi kid) sat there in this scene like a dud! I'm not saying that she wasn't good in the part because she was and I know how hard it is to play that role so I know how much effort and concentration it takes. But she could have done soooooooo much more throughout the whole movie. Yes the may have been trying to put a modern twist on the movie but that was a bad move. This is one of the most inspiring stories in the world and they should have stuck to the facts and the oringal script! In the pump scene at the end we had a real working pump on stage (with a bucket under it!) and there were people in the audience crying!  This girl just didn't do justice to the story. I did like the movie simply because its a wonderful story with or without good and skilled actors. So parents if you want to expose your kids to this uplifting story then wait until the kids are about 8,9,or 10 so you can show them the orginal Duke/Bancroft version. I know most younger children dislike black and white so if you really want them to understand and have a good grip on this story then wait until they are old enough to sit down and watch this movie without complaining of boredom just because it's not in technicolor.
If anyone has any questions about the theatre or Helen Keller feel free to email me..I may be young but I know a TON of facts about Miss Keller and her life from young to old.

1398486,1,B000056MOF,"I cannot believe all the other positive reviews I'm seeing! As usual, Disney has taken a wonderful story and distorted it with fictional information. I am from Alabama and have visited Ivy Green twice. Aside from the obvious disregard for authenticity with the set, they also missed the mark on several facts. Just one example--the Kellers did not have slaves, they had sharecroppers. Slavery had been abolished by the time Helen was born in 1880! No wonder people have such warped images of the South, thanks to irresponsible filmakers like this. The story was great enough to stand on its own without all the changes, just as it has for many years. Disney changes it because they apparently aren't confident enough in their ability to produce a good film. This movie only further proves that. Don't waste your time on this one, parents.

The Pepsi-girl, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, gives a fantastic performance as the famous Helen Keller.  She managed to pull off one of the most difficult jobs for any actor or actress - playing a the role of a deaf-mute, not to mention the blind part.
Alison Elliott plays Annie Sullivan, a woman dedicated to teaching Helen more than anyone could have ever dreamed of; the two are amazing, and each actress played off each other's extreme professionalism in making this film work.  It could have easily failed without these two in their respective roles.

1398490,3,B000056MOF,"After I watched this movie, I still like the original 1962 better. Why? Because it has more emotional impact in it, and it has really funny scenes like the ""feeling emotions on faces"" the original has. The ""battle of wills"" is more tame in this (the Disney version) one than the original. I've noticed they left out some really good scenes that was from the original.
  This version from Disney is ok. The actress who played Anne Sullivan did good, but I like the original James (Helen's half-brother) better than this one. The little girl who played Helen in this version is not as good as Patty Duke, but she did well.
  If I had a choice, I'd pick the original. But this is good to watch too, if you want to see both versions, even though it is MUCH different than the 1962 movie.",1056931200,21,783,4.379310344827586

I have yet to see the 1970 version Starring Patty Duke (as Annie Sullivan this time) and Melissa Gilbert. Allison Elliot was quite good at acting out the legendary Annie Sullivan, but like Eisenberg, she did not have the affect that Anne Bancroft had in the 1962 version. ""The Miracle Worker"" starring Alison Elliott and Hallie Eisenberg was a touching story, but I cannot give much credit on the acting.",1040083200,,595,4.5607476635514015

I have to say that my students loved this movie (9th graders)and when the movie ended they were left with a desire to know more about Helen Keller and the manual alphabet.  This movie had a great impact on me as well as my students so I have to say that it was great. I have yet to see the 62 version (which I have heard is excellent)But this movie served my purpose in class and I do recommend it to anyone.",1012348800,3,639,4.096
1398494,4,B000056MOF,"Ok, so maybe it doesn't have the same spark as the original ""Miracle Worker"" with Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft did, but it worked. There was nothing wrong with this movie. It's an extremely sensitive retelling of the classic story of a deaf, blind and mute little girl who learned to communicate through the tireless teachings of Annie Sullivan. This version was VERY different, and the acting was not quite as passionate as it was in the original movie, but what can I say? I still loved it. Hallie Kate Eisenberg is, without a doubt, absolutely adorable and Alison Elliott does an excellent job in her role as Ms. Sullivan. I do have to admit that it was quite a stretch to see Eisenberg, whom we all recognize as ""The Pepsi Girl,"" taking on such a complex role. Portraying Helen Keller has got to be extremely difficult, and I'm sure many people feel that Eisenberg wasn't able to pull it off. But in my opinion, she did fine in the role. This movie profiles a more prim and graceful Helen who wears pretty dresses with laces and fancy shoes. It's quite a difference from Patty Duke and her more raggedy wardrobe, but who cares? They obviously wanted to give Helen Keller a different sort of style this time around, and hey, it works. And it isn't the clothes that matter in this case--it's the way the story is told. And this movie doesn't stretch or deface the facts, so it's good. Of course, this version didn't outdo the original--I have a hard time believing that anyone would expect it to, anyway. But that's not the point. This is merely just a modern-day retelling of a true story. Maybe this is the type of story that many people believe isn't a story of ""sensitivity,"" but sensitivity  is undoubtedly important. While the 1962 version was absolutely outstanding, there wasn't as much sensitivity in it as there could have been. This new version has more of that, and that's good. Eisenberg made the ending of the movie a thoroughly touching and unforgettable one. I liked seeing Mrs. Keller (Helen's mother) as a gentle woman who really flaunts her incredible amount of love for Helen. Helen's father, Captain James, was very tough and headstrong, and for some reason, that was the image I had painted in my head of Helen's father. Jimmy--the stepbrother of Helen--is charming, and the actor who played this character did a great job. It warmed my heart to see this young, hurting man guide his father to a transformation from anger to understanding. Basically, if you want to see a version of ""The Miracle Worker"" with basic historical accuracy and a fair share of sensitivity, then by all means buy this 2000 version. It doesn't equal the 1962 masterpiece that we all know and love, but it is still very good. It's also a WONDERFUL way to introduce younger children to the story of Helen Keller. The script is simple and straightforward, so if you are one of those people who does not know the story, this is a great movie to help you become better acquainted with Helen's unforgettable conversion to light and knowledge. My advice? Buy the movie--what's the harm? Just buy it and enjoy seeing a new version of the story.",1009497600,17,3136,4.6606498194945845
