8396486,5,B003GLYL1Y,"This film's title is actually Possessed aka Living Death and can be found under both titles online. Heui-jin comes home from college when her religious-fanatic mother calls to tell her that her 13 year old sister, So-jin, has gone missing. Heui-jin files a missing persons report, since her mother will do nothing but pray for So-jin's return. Heui-jin and a cop with a dying child start investigating the neighbors, all of whom have stories about So-jin being Possessed. As they dig deeper, they discover things beyond their understanding.

The crane figures prominently in this film and it is up to interpretation as to whether she is possessed by a crane spirit or if the traditional meaning of crane in Asian culture is at play here, as a hint to So-jin's whereabouts. I think it may be both. There is so much symbolism here that it reminds me very much of A Tale of Two Sisters- you can watch this movie many times over to understand all the symbolism and metaphors shown. I do not profess to understand half of them, although clearly the director is trying to show that too much of anything is harmful (religion). There are scenes of binging and purging, suggesting possibly that the characters are trying to free themselves from something...sin, perhaps? I strongly recommend this film for fans of Asian horror-it is truly superb.",1362441600,,1337,4.8384279475982535
