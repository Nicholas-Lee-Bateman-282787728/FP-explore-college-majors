1445068,3,B00005JL29,"""Murder By Numbers"" is merely the latest version of the old Leopold and Loeb story, wherein two amoral youths plan and execute a cold-blooded murder for the sheer intellectual challenge of seeing if they can get away with it.  Alfred Hitchcock had a go at the tale back in the 1940's in a film called ""Rope,"" and now it appears to be Barbet Schroeder's turn this time around.  Aided by writer Tony Gayton, Schroeder focuses on Richard and Justin, two high school buddies living in a bucolic seaside community in Northern California, who commit murder in order to prove Justin's thesis that the courage to carry through with a crime is the ultimate form of human freedom.  Anyone who has read ""Crime and Punishment"" will know immediately that this is not a particularly original philosophical position and, in fact, the film even makes some heavy-handed allusions to that famous novel in the fact that one of the characters in the movie keeps referring to Justin, the mastermind of the plot, as ""Napoleon"" (Napoleon serves as the inspiration for the novel's main character, Raskolnikov).  Richard is the pretty little rich boy, popular in school for both his good looks and his attitude of cool detachment, while Justin is the nerdy intellectual, dismissed by most of his peers as creepily eccentric, who has made an exhaustive study of just how to ""get away with murder"" by circumventing all the forensic techniques used in modern crime scene investigation.
""Murder By Numbers"" is definitely at its best when it is focusing on the two youths and the strange relationship between them - and clearly at its worst when it is viewing matters from the opposite perspective, that of the criminal investigating team led by Cassie Mayweather, played by Sandra Bullock.  Cassis seems to come equipped with all the standard baggage common to lead female characters who happen to be working in a predominantly ugly (i.e. male-dominated) profession.  The brusque demeanor with which she confronts most of her colleagues has earned her the affectionate nicknames ""Hyena"" and ""Scorpion"" (the former because hyenas apparently have a pseudo-penis and the latter for more obviously symbolic reasons).  Not only is this beautiful young woman (as always) unattached (why are such attractive people in movies never in relationships?), but she drives men away by her refusal to let any of them get truly near to her.  The filmmakers have tried to apply some psychological depth to her character by having her suffering from the effects of a traumatic event in her past, but this whole aspect seems strangely unconvincing and tacked on - and rather distracting when what we really want to be doing is following the much more interesting drama taking place between the two boys.
Although Bullock is never less than competent in the lead role, the scene-stealers turn out to be Ryan Gosling as Richard and, most especially, Michael Pitt as Justin.  These two fine actors command our attention every time they appear on the screen and lift this rather routine script to the level of high drama more frequently than it surely deserves.  Pitt, in particular, beautifully underplays the role of the social outcast, a boy so intellectually brilliant that he cannot connect with the flesh-and-blood people around him.  Yet, the single finest aspect of the screenplay is that it does not portray Pitt as a hopelessly twisted maniac.  He is, in fact, capable of both compassion and fear - a fact which helps to make his character compelling and complex enough to pique our interest.
""Murder By Numbers"" is, in a way, an appropriately named movie.  But thanks to sharp performances by Gosling and Pitt, the film has more to offer than it otherwise might.",1019347200,17,3721,4.972624798711755
1445069,5,B00005JL29,I usually love all the movies Sandra Bullock is in. A few of the movies she's made have been terrible but this one is not one of those. She plays a detective out to solve the murder of a woman. Two highschool students are the ones who killed her and Sandra is on to them from the moment she meets them. The boys killed the woman just to see if they could get away with it. It appears there's a very strong bond between them. It seems as though if they weren't busy framing the janitor for murder they would be making love. But they channel their love for each other into this plot to set up the perfect murder and play games with Sandra. She has personal problems of her own and her past keeps getting dragged up which I could have done without personally. But the movie works. Sandra proves herself in this movie that she can play any part in any movie.,1019347200,2,854,4.181818181818182
1445070,4,B00005JL29,"Being a huge fan of criminal investigation movies I jumped at the chance to see this. From the previews I already knew Sandra Bullocks storyline would not be as interesting as the two boys in the movie.
In the first 5 minutes of the movie you already know whodunit. The movie is a mystery in the sense as ""how did they do it"" and ""will they get away with it?"" Sanda Bullock portrays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with a dark secret(zzzz) who sets out to find whodunit.
The movie seems to have two in one. You have Sandra Bullocks movie and you have Justin and Richards movie.
The reason I say 'Sandra Bullock's' movie is because the character she portrays is not a far stretch from others she has played. Therefore, when her storyline appears you can't see her as Cassie Mayweather-You only see her as Sandra Bullock. Its almost as if Sandra Bullock wants to try a dark role but can't go the whole distance.
Justin and Richard are the two boys whom may or may not get away from Sandra's grasp. Their movie is far more interesting. It's intense, dark, disturbing, and a unique way of portraying a relationship between two friends holding their own secret. Every time their storyline appears you open your eyes, you listen, you tell people next to you to shut the hell up! You want to know more about them, you want to see how they will react, and though they are the villains you like them! Though movies have a tendency to shy away from teen violence this one heads it straight on. It looks at the realistic view of it and you are left wondering 'why do teens today do this [stuff]?'
The story line of the two boys is soooooo intriguing you damn Sandra Bullock for showing up and making us watch her character try to 'find herself.' She is the typical woman cop character. She acts manly, is made fun of by the intimidated boy cops, does not have great romantic relationships, and holds a dark secret that has traumatized and taken over her life. Her character is so cardboard, you find it hard to even care about her 'secret.' But we are subjected to watching her while we wait for more of the boys.
This movie is good-maybe even great. However, it would have been amazing if it would have concentrated soley on the boys storyline and used the cops as a minor storyline. I guess Sandra Bullock just couldn't be the supporting actress in this movie. Some will love this movie, some will hate it, some will see it once and forget all about it later. My advice is, don't pay attention to mine or others reviews and just go with what you feel. If you want to go see it-by all means, go! Enjoy! Because although it had its flaws I do not feel my money was wasted.",1019347200,,2654,4.396341463414634
1445071,2,B00005JL29,"The idea was good, two young high schoolers plot the perfect murder.  Sandra Bullock plays the cop/profiler who disses shrinks and has serious issues of her own.  Half the time Bullock seems slightly psycho and the other half totally confused. Her reaction in certain situations don't seem believable, like when one of the suspects catches her photographing him. She didn't act like a cop.  I don't think she had a good handle on her part.  Every character was a stereotype and the script worked too hard at shoving in twists and turns at every opportunity.  Save your money...it will be on t.v. soon enough.",1019174400,,608,4.8076923076923075
1445072,4,B00005JL29,"I saw this film when it first came out and loved it, that was about a year and a half ago.  I haven't seen it again, I noticed I had reviewed it back in April 2002 praising it, but after reading the review now I just had to change it.  I had mentioned the film Se7en for some reason and Numbers doesn't deserve that credit.  However, I did like Numbers, and if you are looking for a good thriller, this is a fine choice.",1019088000,,420,3.9761904761904763
1445073,4,B00005JL29,"Finally, Sandra Bullock has acted in a good film!  Ever since I saw her in 'Speed', I always thought that she was a talented actress.  But then 'While you were sleeping' and 'Hope floats' were thoroughly cliched and made me wonder if she was just a one-film wonder.  Well, she did prove me otherwise in 'Murder by numbers'.
If you thought from the title or the trailer that this film is about a serial killer, you are wrong (I did that same mistake too!).  This film is about the perfect crime or what the killer(s) think will be a perfect crime.  As is the case with all killers, they do one simple mistake and that is enough for Casey (the cop played by Sandra Bullock) and her partner Sam to solve the case.
Even though there is no actual suspense in the film, I will not spoil the plot by telling who the killers are.  The director does not attempt to hide the identity of the killers, it is fairly clear who the killers are right from the first or second scene.  In spite of this, the film continues to gather momentum, with Sandra Bullock and her partner doing their detective work meticulously.  Where the film lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for it in the tight story-line and the excellent acting by all the actors.
Sandra Bullock is very convincing as the troubled cop who has a checkered history of her own and that comes to light as the film progresses.  Ben Chaplin, who plays Bullock's partner Sam is good too, but the best acting in the film comes from the two young men played by Ryan Gosling (who plays Richard) and Michael Pitt (who plays Justin).  Gosling is nothing less than brilliant in his portrayal and his future as an actor sure looks bright.
The film drags a bit towards the end, with the climax being a bit cliched.  But this is surely a film that is worth seeing!",1018915200,47,1801,4.378378378378378

Subtleties of suspense would have driven the story better, and the writer/director did not allow Bullock's character to become interesting or really develop gracefully at all.",1503100800,,395,5.285714285714286

1445215,4,B00005JL29,"This 2002 movie wears well and  is a must for Ryan Gosling fans.  He has a magnetic star quality that rises above mediocre material.  Michael Pitt also provides a chilling rendition of a very disturbed teen psychopath who is Gosling's partner in murder. These teen killers are in the gunsite of a detective played by Sandra Bullock who has a grim background of her own and the motivation to outsmart and outplay these very brilliant and dangerous boys. I enjoyed the re-watch and recommend it as a rental for crime movie fans.  I am amused by all the reviews recently that just say, ""I liked it"" or ""it's great"", etc.  I think these are fake, paid reviews providing no content and just keeping the  movie's ratings high.

She does a great job acting - it's just the subject matter itself is a little - I don't know - blah, I guess is the word.  Starts out with a great plot, but quickly goes into more of a ""let's throw everything out there and see if anything sticks"" kind of event.

Basically Sandra Bullock plays a homicide detective that picks up a murder case involving a woman with few clues as to her death.  Two high school kids (one played by a very young Ryan Gosling) think they can commit the perfect murder and out-smart the cops.  Cassie (Sandra) battles her own demons as she works out the who, why, and when of the murder, and along the way, allows her new partner and the case itself, to help her work through her some of her personal issues.

The ending is good.  The middle gets a little whacked out - and it sounds like it would be a better movie than it ended up being - but that's not Sandra's fault.  Just seems like it fell flat - maybe the director got a bit too ambitious?  Still worth seeing - but leave out of the Sandra marathon.",1383955200,,1192,4.234513274336283

One is the theoretician and the other the practitioner, officially. But the practitioner is a voyeur more than a real murderer. He enjoys seeing a murder being committed, and he is going to manipulate the theoretician who does not have the guts nor courage to do it himself into doing the crime in front of him. And that kind of dare always works with teenagers, even if they vomit afterwards.

But that is too complicated to make a good thriller or too simplistic to make a good film. It is a poor psychological drama and what's more the practitioner who did not do it will end up dead, whereas the theoretician who did everything will end up saving the cop and going to court for life-imprisonment. So there is a justice after all, though this justice is neither human nor divine, plain accidental or incidental.

We know from the very start that is what is going to happen but then the details are banal and lackluster. There is no suspense at all in fact and the theoretician does not even know that in crime there must be no pardon and no pity. Mediocre baboon.

In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.
The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock.

The two young boys are absolutely chilling.  Ben Chaplin is adequate.  My major problem is with the police department's eagerness to wrap up the case, and the way Cassie's boss treats her when she is not satisfied with the way the case is initially closed.  If she is so bad at her job that her boss won't even recognize her instincts, why does he even keep her on the force?  I found his treatment to be demeaning and unrealistic.

1445907,3,B00005JL29,"I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, but truth be told I enjoy my Bullock in those stellar romantic comedies she made her own.  That isn't to say that I can't rally behind `Sandra Bullock-Serious Actress' but I have my preferences and they are mine to have.  That said, I enjoyed `Murder by Numbers' for what it was, but it never became something overly memorable for me.  Sandra does a decent enough job of getting inside her character, but her niche definitely lays within the romantic comedy and so there are times when this performance seems a tad forced.  This isn't to say that Sandra can't pull off dramatic; just watch her performance in `Crash' and you'll see that she has the chops to pull off a well written character, but `Murder by Numbers' doesn't offer her anything more than a walking clich&eacute; to embody.

The film focuses on a disturbing murder of a young woman and the detective who tracks down the two boys who committed the crime.  Sandra plays that said detective; Cassie Mayweather.  Cassie has her own issues (when I mentioned clich&eacute;s I was talking about her back-story; very been there done that) and these issues make this case all the more pertinent to her.  The two boys who committed this crime; Richard and Justin; have a fun time stringing the detectives along with planted clues to lead them down the wrong path, all the while laughing in the face of destiny.

Sadly, these two young killers are also nothing more than a collective sum of movie villain clich&eacute;s.  Richard is the sarcastic and witty popular kid who bosses Justin around with confidence and a false sense of loyalty while Justin is the stark opposite; shy and introverted and obviously harboring some sort of attraction towards Richard, most likely due to Richard's apparent dominance.

A major highlight to the film, and something that helps elevate it to `worth checking out' territory, is Ryan Gosling's dynamic performance.  Gosling has grown into one of our finest young actors as of late, and his performance here is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his abilities.  What he does with Richard is phenomenal, taking an overly clich&eacute;d and familiar character and infusing so much originality and style that he becomes a character belonging only to Gosling.  Sure, this same type of character has been attempted plenty of times before, but rarely this well.

As far as the remaining performances are concerned, they pale in comparison.  Bullock does turn in some nice moments but this is far from her comfort zone and it shows.  I commend her for branching out a bit but this is not her usual greatness.  Ben Chaplin is really here to fill space and add to Mayweather's personal life.  He is decent but forgettable.  Michael Pitt, an actor who I can take or leave (I thought he was decent in `The Dreamers' but nothing special), is really pitiful here.  He falls into his characters clich&eacute;s full throttle and doesn't seem able to rise above them.  He seems to play to his odd appearance too much, relying on his `little boy face' too much in order to relay his characters feelings.  It doesn't work so well for him.  When he attempts `brooding' it looks more like a young child who is pouting.

In the end I can say that `Murder by Numbers' is a decent thriller.  What helps is the fact that the plot is interesting and the script is in parts very smart.  It's a nice play on the `cat and mouse' type crime genre and, as I mentioned, Gosling really does make the most of what he's given.  It's not perfect and it may never warrant repeat viewings but if you haven't seen it then you won't be wasting any time if you do.  It is satisfying in what it's here for.  It's just a shame the characters are a little too `paint by numbers'.

1445967,5,B00005JL29,"Sandra Bullock stars as Cassie Mayweather, a tough police detective who's investigating a murder with the help of her new partner (Ben Chaplin).  There are a lot of clues that just don't add up, until Cassie begins to suspect two smart, rich, and very arrogant high school students (Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt).

Actually, we know who did it from the first moments of the film; the fun lies in seeing how Cassie will connect the dots and catch them.  This is a terrific movie, full of suspense and action.  Bullock's character wears a mask of bravado but is really quite wounded from a tragic incident in her past; this makes her vulnerable and likeable, and she has great screen presence.  Chaplin holds his own with her, mixing detective work with inevitable romance, and Gosling and Pitt are outstanding as the creepy teens who think they've committed the perfect crime.

1445968,3,B00005JL29,"The best reason to see this movie now, several years after it came out, is to enjoy an early role from Ryan Gosling.  In many ways, his performance as one of two empty, misguided teenage boys who commit murder just to see if they can do it got him the initial attention that later led to success in UNITED STATES OF LELAND, THE NOTEBOOK, HALF NELSON&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Nelson/dp/B000KX0IOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Nelson</a>, FRACTURE, etc.  He is very good, in a way that reminds me of early performances from Ed Norton.  His mannerisms weren't so familiar yet...he seemed fresh and alive.  When he's on screen...the movie pops and you can't take your eyes off him.

Michael Pitt, as the other killer, is a creepy presence as well...but he's a more predictable character...just kinda morose and an obvious outsider.  He has no charisma (nor should he) and Gosling's character just stomps all over him.  One could argue that Gosling isn't playing the movie at the same level as the rest of the cast...he's up on a different plane...and therefore he's really upstaging his fellow actors.  But honestly, if it weren't for his out-there intensity...the movie would be a waste of time.

So, the criminals are mostly fun to watch.  We enjoy seeing how they put it all together, and how the start to fall apart as the cops move in.  That's fine.  But on the other side, we have the ""good guys"" primarily represented by Sandra Bullock.  We're to believe she's this damaged soul, driven to take reckless shortcuts and driven to sleep with (and dispose of) all her male partners.  It's possible that a more feral actress, or a more skillful one, could have pulled off this rather ridiculous character.  But Bullock flounders.  Her relationship with her fellow cops consists mostly of her tossing off insults and innuendos...followed by unconvincing scenes of seduction.  When she tries to rub Ben Chaplin's groin with her sock covered foot in an effort to arouse him...it was cringe-inducing...because Bullock looked so totally uninterested.  Obviously, her character has been badly wounded in the past, and we can understand that her relationships with others might be spotty...but mostly she comes across as unlikeable and UNSYMPATHETIC.  That's the big problem...we don't feel for her...we just dislike her.

The plot itself is fairly straightforward...and frankly, it wasn't really too hard to get these two ""perfect criminals.""  It's the cat-and-mouse aspect we're most supposed to enjoy, as Gosling and Bullock play with each other.  Gosling holds up his end of the act quite admirably...Bullock not so much.

It's an okay movie, and if you're a Gosling fan, it's a must see.  But this SILENCE OF THE LAMB wannabe falls short of that high mark by a long shot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>",1190678400,,3055,5.506437768240343
1445969,4,B00005JL29,"The title of this movie is misleading. It leads you to expect an Agatha Christie-style whodunit, whereas in fact this story is more of a realistic, edgy take on a Leopold-and-Loeb kind of murder.

As in the real Leopold and Loeb case, a lot of the detective work here revolves around establishing who was instigator of the crime and who was mere follower. There are some interesting twists on our expectations.

Paralleling the often reverse relationship between the killers is the reverse relationship between the male and female detectives on the case. Sandra Bullock takes the lead and doesn't stand around merely batting her eyes in admiration of her male's partner's prowess. And most unexpected of all, her male partner is quite willing to admire and learn from her competence.

1445970,3,B00005JL29,"Murder by Numbers has an interesting, if derivative premise -- two high school students plotting what they think will be the perfect murder. The dramatic device lets the audience in on the crime and the investigation, so the tension arises as the antagonists and protagonists get closer to each other. This is nothing new and director Barbet Schroeder doesn't improve on the convention, but he overcomes a possible extended cliche by getting very good performances from most of his cast. Ryan Gosling is especially compelling and his subsequent work bears out the notion that he is a major talent. Sandra Bullock adds a new facet to her standard screen persona by playing a more aggressive character and her foil, Ben Chaplin, adds a nice touch as her sympathetic if puzzled partner. I was not much enamored of Michael Pitt's performance, though that may be a function of the way the character was written. His inwardness, if I may call it that, seemed overplayed at times, and the revelations of the character's actions and motives felt forced. This was probably, however, the most difficult role of all. I also had some problems with the final set piece at the ocean house, especially the sequence on the crumbling porch which looked very stagy and incongruous in style with the preceding pieces. But it is good, if not great, film. Bullock is always worth watching and her sparring with Gosling in this film was, for me, its highlight.",1175817600,,1438,4.873469387755102

First of all, Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in, you could tell Gosling was on his way to bigger and better things. He is amazing as the creepy and high-school bored Richard. Bullock pulls off another solid preformance, I have been a huge fan of Bullock since While You Were Sleeping, she has great charisma in every movie she appears in.

Both from wealthy backgrounds, they are otherwise opposite in personalities and in their tastes.  Richard is the outgoing jock personality, and Justin is a shy, over-achieving introvert who tutors other students.

Unfortunately for the boys, the detective assigned to the case is seasoned crime scene veteran Cassie Mayweather (the incomparable Sandra Bullock - in her best role to date).  Cassie and her new partner from vice, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin) begin to slowly unlock the mysteries of the murder of young Olivia Lake.

Though the boys seem to have thought of everything, they didn't count on Cassie's intimate background with violent crime.  Cassie smells a rat in the boy's stories, though she can't get partner Sam to agree with her on it.  Striking out on her own, she delves deeper into the crime to uncover the secrets the boys are trying to keep hidden.

Sandra Bullock is in her best role ever as the serious Cassie Mayweather.  No bubbly ""girl next door"" here.  Though seen as hardened and called ""The Hyena"", Cassie doesn't quite fit the bill with her interior weakness constantly fighting to surface, especially now that the parole hearing is up for her long-ago attacker.

'Murder By Numbers' isn't a ""whodunit"" but rather a ""why'd they do it"" type of murder mystery.  Why would two boys from wealthy but separate backgrounds band together to commit the perfect crime.  Boredom?  Ego?  Science?  Perfection?  Whatever you decide, this is a mystery-crime movie that won't leave you bored or whispering into the dark ""why'd I rent this?""  Definitely a ""buy"".  Enjoy!",1171065600,7,1734,5.128571428571429

This movie has all kinds of surprises the first time you see it and I have to say it is one of the greatest movies that I have seen Sandra in.

She plays a homicide detective and tries to find the killers of a woman.  While doing so we find out about her past adn why she is the way she is.  It also talks about why people murder other people and how they make their moves in a murder.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Sandra Bullock plays a police detective with a psychologically painful and checkered past who is aiming to investigate and find out what happened when a women was found dead in a river recently.
 This movie is unbelievably predictable that there is little of anything that instantly grabs your attention. The acting is incredibly hammy and it almost feels like you can tell that Sandra really wanted to walk off the set of this film and for good reason: ""Murder by Numbers"" is absolutely boring and never gets off the ground.

1446086,2,B00005JL29,"Murder by Numbers is a neat concept. What if people who know all about murders decide to commit a murder? Pretty cool, huh?
And what if they were high school students?
Alright, that seems strange. It actually makes it creepier -- the high school students are definitely Columbine types, the kind who have somehow strayed so far from society (and yet right under our noses) that they are no longer capable of empathy. In the case of Murder by Numbers, the two main characters -- in a relationship with mildly homosexual undertones -- decide to prove they are truly free by intentionally committing murder.
It sounds better in the movie than in print.
The woman assigned to this case is Cassie Mayweather, played by Sandra Bullock. Let me state my bias up front: I really like Sandra Bullock. Her button-nosed cuteness allows me to forgive her when she makes crappy movies like Miss Congeniality. She had me at The Net.
But you've got to be realistic even about the actors you like. And Sandra's just out of her league here.
Like Jet Li in The One, this is a complex plot that requires a range of acting abilities that Sandra simply doesn't possess. She's supposed to be a woman with a dark past, a near-death murder victim, a survivor of physical abuse, a licentious woman who sleeps with her partners at a whim. This is not Sandra. And usually, Sandra plays movies around her own carefully cultivated movie personality.
In short, this movie requires actual acting.
She can't do it. Not for lack of trying. But Sandra comes off as cutesy flirtatious when she's supposed to be a maneater. She comes off as an agitated socialite with a headache rather than a down and dirty cop who was nearly stabbed to death. She's much more victim than survivor.
And of course, what Sandra does best is play the victim. She survives, but she's not a SURVIVOR.
The ending has a twist. It's not a great twist. The movie is creepy, but not fast enough to pull it off. The actors who play the high school students are disturbing, but they are not so competent to make it genuinely horrifying.
Slow. Plodding. Not genuinely real enough characters to make us worry about them or believe their plight. A workman-like effort, but not Sandra's best work.",1079913600,8,2228,4.657360406091371

The overly psychological aspects of the film are what make it such an excellent presentation. From two suburban boys of varying personalities, to investigators in the same predicament, Murder by Numbers is chillingly entrancing.

You can be repulsed by what the boys have done, and by the scenes that show their violence, but you can't help getting drawn into their world and feeling sorry for at least Michael Pitt's character when they face the consequences of their actions.
As for Sandra Bullock's portrayl of emotionally damaged Cassie Mayweather - I thought she did an excellent job.  Sandra is America's Sweetheart, and yet she plays Cassie so perfectly - with her subtle humor and aggressive personality.  One of the reasons the movie is so well done is because it can at once make you chuckle, cringe, gasp, or cheer, and make you feel a thousand other emotions you won't be able to put your finger on.  The people who gave this movie bad reviews did not look into the movie deep enough, and could not appreciate the psychological elements that give the movie its power.

I really feel she has more to offer, and this showed a depth of emotion that most of her films over the last 5 years don't show.  So...one of those stars is specifically for that.  In fact, all of the acting was well done.
The movie itself...really only deserves 3.  As with the other reviews, I'll reiterate.  2 High School (we assume 18 yo) Seniors commit a murder, for the sake of proving they can create a forensically misleading case for the police who come to investigate the crime.  Those two lucky homicide investigators are Cassy/Sandra Bullock (with her dark victim-paralleled skeletons), and Sam/Ben Chaplin (a veteran cop, but Cassy's new partner).  And, while Sam follows the 'planted' crime scene leads to a textbook perpetrator...Cassy's personal obsessions cause her to be skeptical and objective toward other possibilities.
There were two main problems with this movie.  First...the continuity was confusing.  You are faced with the reality of Cassy's demons WAY too late in the movie.  Subsequently, you spend just enough time in her dream sequences to be frustrated at ""just what the heck am I supposed to be getting out of this?""
The other problem, essentially, was the end of the movie.  Where we find out some disappointing truths, and watch a [painfully] predictably bad ending.
I will admit that the special effects on the ending, and throughout the movie really, were well done.  Details like activity outside of windows in apartment scenes, etc. were all done rather well.
One final note...is that there was this recurring homosexual overtone in the movie.  It was never developed, only implied...and then ambiguously ignored when creating dissention between the 2 antoganists.

However, watching detectives follow constantly-plotting high schoolers around was just downright boring at times. Also, I felt that the rich kid might have been gay.

The story is inspired by the Leopold and Loeb crime of the 1920's and does a good job of using both the main premise of that crime and some of the subtler details.

Of course, all the other cops go with the trail of clues, while Bullock's hunches always see the truth.  She has some inner-demons, but it wasn't very moving. The story has that feel of we've seen all of this before... and it was done better the last three times.  This wasn't all that bad- it just wasn't all that good considering the star and the director.  The criminals' story got old fast, and the believibility was strained by the end.  Bullock's performance reminded me of Holly Hunter as a detective in Copycat where I never got over the mis-casting.  Ok for a movie rental, but if I had seen it in the theater I might be more negative.

She hands in a commanding performance as Cassie Mayweather, a homicide investigator who is looking into the murder of a young woman. The character is strong, with a few expections. There is too much backstory involved, and by the time it all comes together you'll wonder why it took so long for them to develop this part of the story. We spend most of the movie watching her, wondering what her past is, and it's very anti-climatic when she finally spills the beans on her past. Her partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin) is also a very bland character, however he shines in a few scenes especially during the interrogation near the end of the movie. Ryan Gosling plays Richard, the rich kid who is ""free"" and Michael Pitt plays Justin, the smart kid who is not ""free"" but longs to be. The plot however is well written, and well paced so viewers can piece together what's happening without fault. Just when you think there are no more twists and turns, it goes to show you wrong once again when you least expect it.

With 20 minutes to go, the movie shifts from being an intellectual, well written, and gripping story to quite possibly the worst 20 minutes of cinema in the last 100 years!!! The movie becomes moronic to say the least. The viewer learns that all the story lines in the movie have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The two high school students turn from being intelligent people with a weird motives to two people performing what I thought was a spoof on thriller movies, and the movie had one sentence that combined the two main story lines together. I have two theories: 1 - The movie ran out of time and money, or 2 - The producer decided to let his summer intern write the last 20 minutes of the movie.

This MURDER BY NUMBERS was a waste of time, I tought it would be so much better. What dissapointment!
There's no sense at all about the movie! The two kids are utterly evil, but BUllock' character (Cassie) say to Justin that he was just being ""used"" by the other guy and was a good boy, because Justin vomitted when taking the body to the jungle!!! Great guy...
Also, Cassie is so annoying that you even want to fire her from POlice Department yourself! Ben Chaplin plays a side-kick here and also must take care of his career, after performing on that stupid movie alongside Nicole KIdman.
There's the old, (I mean, OLD!) cliche of the police chief who is always in a bad mood....
There are total incoeherences in the plot. THe good loking killer guy is portrayed, according to Cassie, as being rich and adorable by everyone in the high school.. BUt the guy is always smoking, he's not an athlete, he's not surrounded by girls, and one of the reasons he supposedly commits the murder is to gain attention!
Useless scenes like the one about this guy (Richard) and Bullock arguing around her car.
CHris Penn's role here is also sad...Such a small role, it seems someone in the production team was paying him a favour...
In general, this movie leads you nowhere, absolutely nowhere. You can't simpatize with Cassie, you can't simpatize with the killers, you can't simpatize with Chaplin, you can't simpatize with the girl (Lisa) that is seduced by Richard screaming nosense inside his car while listening to Iron Maiden's The Number of The Beast...

""Murder by Numbers"" is a psychological triller, where two high school boys want to commit the perfect crime.
Sandra Bullock (Cassie Mayweather) is a cop who has to investigate a crime of a young woman. This crime is a little related to her dark-past, which Cassie (Sandra Bullock) wants to forget.
Sandra Bullock is really deep, and this is one of her best perfomances. You're used to see her making laugh you, but this time, she's a cop with a crude, dark past that she wants, but can't forget...
Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt's perfomances are really good...Ryan Gosling plays Richard Haywood, the ""cool"" high school kid who together with his friend Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt) ""the smart one"" want to commit the perfect murder, and want to prove they're smarter than the caps.
Ben Chaplin is the new San Benito Police detective Sam Kennedy, who is helping Cassie (Sandra Bullock) in this case.
Surprisingly, Cassie (Sandra Bullock) try to have a ""rare"" relationship with her partner Sam (Ben Chaplin)...but with all the lack of romanticism...

I couldn't get immersed in any sort of reality in this film.  I didn't find the boys menacing or Sandra Bullock believable as a hard-bitten cop.  Their acting was good, and if the time spent on Bullock's clunky back-story had been devoted to more in-depth characterizations of the boys, the movie might have succeeded.  Bullock had too much baggage to carry, and the boys didn't have enough.
The story is very loosely based on the Chicago Leopold & Loeb murders in the '20's.  Two overly bright boys with too much time and money on their hands plan the ""perfect"" murder.  Justin (Michael Pitt) is shown as enjoying the planning and theory, but procrastinates on the execution. He is a dreamy intellectual boy who is compelling with his androgynous looks. Richard (Ryan Gosling) appears to be the man of action--doesn't care about the whys and wherefores, just wants the thrill. Gosling wears Richard's #1 Popular Boy personality like a second skin.  The difficulty is in imagining how these two polar opposites ever got together at all. Sandra Bullock (Cassie) is the detective in charge whose personality is supposedly so abrasive; she is called ""The Hyena"" behind her back.  She may be sexually dismissive, intuitive, hyper-energized, but a Hyena, she is not.  She backs down from confrontations right and left.  Her partner, Ben Chaplin, was one big cipher to me.  He had a pained demeanor throughout. He didn't act; he was acted upon.
The pace was good, and the film was entertaining.  Miss Bullock put a lot of effort into her role, but I couldn't help but think how a Stockard Channing or a Sigourney Weaver would have made her role a tour de force. 3-1/2 stars.

1446308,3,B00005JL29,"This is an interesting detective flick that could have been much better.  The story is a contemporary twist on the standard crime drama where the diabolical murderers try to outsmart the wily detective.  The contemporary twist is that the murderers are two high school students who are brilliant but bored so they decide to plan the perfect murder and play a cat and mouse game with the police.
Therein lies the flaw.  It is plausible that high school students could go on a killing spree because they are angry, frustrated or alienated (we have unfortunately seen too much of this phenomenon), but boredom doesn't produce this level of calculated evil.  Also, when teens like this snap, the result is messy, not cold and calculated at depicted here.
Director Barbet Schroeder (Single White Female) presents these kids as normal high school students who simply decided that their brand of mischief would be murder.  It might have been more believable if they showed some sociopathic tendencies, but other than the murder, they seem like regular kids.  The union of two kids who are so different, the intropsective loner Justin (Michael Pitt) and the popular rich kid Richard (Ryan Gosling), also fails to resonate.  They supposedly met when Justin was tutoring Richard, which is utterly implausible given the fact that Richard is portrayed as being extremely bright himself.  Also, these types of kids generally have a natural disdain for one another in real life.
The script also bogs down with unnecessary plot elements like Cassie's (Sandra Bullock) mysterious past and a relationship with her partner.  This is an attempt to develop Cassie in a way that has little bearing on the main storyline, and the subplot klunks annoyingly away like a square wheel.
The gathering of forensic evidence and the deductive reasoning that follows is fascinating along with the boys manipulation of the evidence to point the detectives in the wrong direction.  Cassie's intuitive approach to the evidence is also well scripted.
The acting by the boys is well done, with both creating believable characters.  Pitt is moody, sensitive and introspective and renders a tortured character that tries to appear far more confident than he really is.  Gosling gives Richard a cocky bravado that reminded me of James Caan.  He creates a character that is manipulative and cunning.
Sandra Bullock is a terrific actress, but she seems out of place in this role.  Part of the problem is that her character is given too much excess baggage with which to to deal.  She plays Cassie far too tentatively considering this is a female characters that other cops call ""the hyena"".  She seems intimidated by confrontations.  She is completely dominated in the confrontation with the teenage Richard, but she is also weak in scenes with her boss and her partner.  She is much better in the subplot regarding her anguish over her past and the uneasy relationship she has with her partner.  Unfortunately, this is the most irrelevant component of the script.
This film has some interesting elements, but the pieces fail to come together.  Bullock's middling performance along with an unbelievable story reduce this film to mediocrity.  I rated it a 6/10.",1036713600,4,3219,5.047258979206049

1446310,3,B00005JL29,"If you have a teenager, especially if it's a boy, maybe you should take a moment and check to see what the little hooligan is up to. That's the lesson of MURDER BY NUMBERS.
Homicide Detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) is investigating the murder of a young woman whose body was found in the woods replete with tantalizing clues: yellow carpet fibers, the hair of a baboon, and a dollop of vomit. And then there's the victim's one finger that's missing - severed, apparently. Almost from the first, the audience knows that the perps are Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt), two creepy, clever, and bored teenaged boys (See? What did I tell ya!) with way too much time on their hands and too little parental oversight. Most males their age, with hormones sloshing over, just want to score with the babes. These two would rather commit the perfect murder because ... Well, just because, that's all.
To me, MURDER BY NUMBERS has the tempo and feel of a made-for-TV movie. Perhaps it's too contrived. (Ok, ok. Most big screen thriller plots ARE contrived. But this one suggests some rookie screenwriter tried too hard.) Richard and Justin are obviously two sick puppies, and that's cool. But then we have Cassie. Sandra Bullock usually plays a character that a fella would love to take to the prom and then home to visit Mom for milk and warm cookies. Maybe you'd still like to take Cassie home, but Mom had better be a head doctor. Mayweather is hauling some heavy psychological baggage - something to do with the scars just peeking over the top of her top.  Cassie has been seeing the police shrink, and it was hard for me to imagine any law enforcement agency entrusting such a maimed personality with a gun and handcuffs. Moreover, her new partner, Det. Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin) is so bland as to be just short of invisible as an interesting character. And I was never convinced that Richard and Justin posed any sort of threat to Cassie personally, so tension was lacking. Yawn.
I'm giving MURDER BY NUMBERS three stars solely for the reason that I think SB is generally hot, and my eyeballs are still seared with the image of her character prancing out of her make-over session in MISS CONGENIALITY.

I like to listen to the commentaries provided on many DVD's. This one however features many of the problems I've noticed when you have more than one person giving the commentary. The director/producers voice is low and subdued; in fact it's barely audible at points. While the editors voice is loud and clear. It makes me wonder why they can't get their acts together while editing these tracks and normalize the voices to a consistent level. One other problem, they mention three or four times that there are some extra or extended scenes on the DVD, which is completely false.
There are also some continuity problems, the worst of which appears within the first 15 minutes of the film. We see the detectives (Sandra and Ben) at the scene in the woods where the body is found, and Sandra's character is wearing all black. Then the next time we see them they are heading towards her boathouse, presumably coming from the scene of the crime, yet she is wearing a blue shirt, not black.

Bullock is serviceable here though not entirely convincing in the lead role(sorry, she's more effective at comedy) and Ben Chaplin is pretty much wasted here as Bullock's partner.  Only when Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt(as the murdering teens)are on screen does this film spark to life--they are both superb and act circles around their co-stars.  If director Barbet Schroeder had played up the tension between Bullock and Gosling more, the film would have only been the better for it(though the final,life-or-death--and ultimately anticlimatic--scene between Bullock and Gosling is utterly laughable for it's ludicrous execution).

One of them is, as you soon realise in the opening scenes, the investigation of her new case leading to the pair of suspects who turned out affluent high school kids in a peaceful seaside town.  We are introduced, from the beginning, to the culprits, a la ""Columbo"" style.  These two kids Richard and Justine, without particular reasons, kill one of the residents of the town, and leaves the evidence, which they know would fit the description of the criminal that now-familiar FBI profiling would make.  There is an inevitable ""fall guy"" they prepare, and the investigation in fact leads to that conclusion.
But Cassie only is not convinced.  Her instinct as a detective tells her that THEY did it.  But how can she make others in the police believe when everything fits in clean?  And Cassie has another enemy to face, long buried in her memory, but now coming back again.  And that has something to do with her past.
The murder case here is, as many pointed out, loosely based on ""Loeb-Leopold"" case, the real murder which happened in 1924.  But you may forget the fact (unless you want to see more films inspired by the case, like ""Rope"" by Hitchcock, for instance).  You should remember that it is directed by Barbet Schroeder, whose style is seen in thrillers like ""Single White Female.""  He is good at creating sinister, brooding atomosphere, but the storytelling is often not smooth, or often, clumsy.  That same trait can be seen again here, but this case his slow narrative works, because the film attempts to reveal the psycological aspects of the murder, especially those about the rich, spoiled  kids.  He should be praised for not making them simple monsters, trying to set up the plausible characters in them, and two young actors Michael Pitt (no relation to Brad) and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast.
Maybe I am wrong, but it is Sandra Bullock who has some problem.  It is not that she is not good; she is good as a troubled investigator Cassie.  But, it seems that the script demands too much from this leading character, who, as I told, must encounter a couple of hideous facts of life face to face.  When the flashback scenes come on screen, I thought ""Oh, no, please,"" because what they are trying to imply is too obvious from the first ten minutes.  The script attempts to be thrilling, intelligent, and multi-layered, but about the last one, it went too far, I am afraid.
The film shows convincingly detailed forensic techiniques, and the ever-changing relations between the high-school students are always believable (but one love interest, and slight homosexual nuance are both underdeveloped).  My verdict is only three stars, but that's because I prefer Hitchcock, and that's all.

And it is just such a scenario that is visited by director Barbet Schroeder in his taut thriller, ""Murder by Numbers,"" a psychological crime/drama over which the shadow of Hitchcock looms large.  To the discerning viewer, it's evident early on that this film is going to probe a bit deeper than the a typical offering of the genre, and happily it's not an empty promise, but one which Schroeder fulfills entirely.  It's absorbing stuff, and the route he takes for the journey makes this a thoroughly satisfying and thought provoking cinematic experience.
The story revolves around a pair of high school seniors, Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt), two polar opposites living in an upscale seaside city in Northern California, who for their own sundry reasons concoct in theory a ""perfect crime,"" or more specifically, the perfect murder.  And when the body of a young woman is found in a nearby woods, it falls to veteran detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and her partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), to investigate and sort it all out.  The evidence seems to lead in one direction, but certain circumstances and Cassie's instincts come into play, indicating otherwise.  Eventually, the question is, are Richard and Justin involved?  Which is precisely what Cassie-- who is currently dealing with some personal issues-- and Ben have to determine.  All they know for sure is that a woman who should still be walking around isn't; and they have to know why.  And soon.
The screenplay for this film is clever and extremely well written by Tony Gayton, and he goes to a number of sources to create a rather astute and insightful commentary on the human condition, including man's inherent capacity for good and evil.  Reminiscent of the infamous Leopold/Loeb ""thrill killing"" murder case of the 1920s, Gayton's story evokes a philosophical sense of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment,"" and references 19th Century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's ""Lettre du Voyant,"" the famous manifesto in which the visionary poet discusses the goal of the ""voyant,"" the poet who must practice the ""deranging of the senses"" to attain a transcendental state, which he calls the ""unknown.""  Or, as Justin, especially, sees it, ""freedom.""  It's an intelligent treatment of a concept almost too terrifying to even contemplate-- the cold blooded murder of an innocent victim chosen at random, and for nothing more than the singular purpose of the experience.  And it's disconcerting to say the least when you consider the fact that there ""are"" people like this walking around loose in a world we must share with them.
The extraordinary thing about this film is that Schroeder was able to translate Gayton's ideas so succinctly and successfully to the screen.  This material could easily have been rendered in a dry and academic way that would have been tedious, or it could have gone the other way, losing the sagacious aspects entirely in what would have been an ill-advised attempt to capture the attention of those less inclined to embrace an offering demanding of some deliberation.  It created a dangerous line to tread between the possibilities, either/or to which a director of lesser integrity would easily have succumbed.  Schroeder, however, obviously had a firm grasp of Gayton's intent, recognizing from the beginning where the heart and soul of the story lay, and it is that which he proceeded to present in his film.
With every film she makes, Sandra Bullock proves herself increasingly worthy of respect and regard as an actor and as an artist.  She can be America's Sweetheart (Lucy, ""While You Were Sleeping""), the not-quite-the-girl-next-door type (Sarah, ""Forces of Nature""), a savvy FBI agent (Gracie, ""Miss Congeniality""), or a very real person with very real personal issues who just happens to be an accomplished professional in her field, as she portrays here as Cassie.  With every role, Bullock continues to grow as an actor; here, she refuses to trade on her natural charisma and proven, personal qualities to play what could have been just a variation of another ""cop.""  Instead, she creates a character who is obviously conflicted, but who deals with it in her own way in her own time, which adds the kind of personal mystery to Cassie that makes her at once sympathetic and interesting.  It's a convincing, introspective performance that shows yet another side of Bullock, and it's arguably one of her best.
Ben Chaplin does an excellent job, as well, with his portrayal of Sam.  It's a very subtle performance in which he captures the very essence of the mundane realism of everyday life.  Sam is a normal guy who is there to do a job, and Chaplin presents him in terms that are credible and convincing, which in turn lends even more credibility to the overall film.  It's a very understated performance that makes this part and his character entirely effective.
Finally, what really closes the deal for the success of this film are the performances of Gosling and Pitt.  Gosling finds the perfect note in his pretentious, arrogant attitude and self-indulgent personality.  And Pitt affects an eerily unsettling demeanor that will haunt you long after the film has ended.  Together, they are even more effective than Stockwell and Dillman were as the killers Judd and Artie, in the similar 1959 film,  ""Compulsion.""  This story is intrinsically closer to the truth than many will be willing to admit, and because of that, ""Murder by Numbers"" will never achieve the acclaim or stature it deserves; nonetheless, this is riveting drama that is definitely going to make you think and reflect a bit.",1033603200,7,6021,5.012036108324975
1446379,4,B00005JL29,"The young Ryan Gosling and Richard Pitt make all the difference in a film headlined by Sandra Bullock.  Playing the characters of Richard and Justin, two troubled teens of opposite social circles, the psychopathic duo philosophize the justification of a short but effective serial killer career.  Sandra Bullock as the investigating detective almost takes a backseat to the dynamics of Gosling and Pitt who attempt to counter forensic techniques with shrewd and evil methods.
Watching the characters of the suave and arrogant Richard together with the introverted yet brilliant Justin scheming against investigating authorities makes the film all worthwhile.  One almost wants to see how far the pair can proceed with their evil doings in this combat of minds against the police.  But just like  any true serial killer's ""M.O"", we want them to be caught, and here is where the themes collide to make the story interesting.
Sandra Bullock's character is also one of interest, as she plays a former victim-turned-detective with a masochistic preference for relationships.  Ben Chaplin gives some balance as her partner, in more than one way, but again it's high schoolers Richard and Justin who make the film move.  I will be curious to see the next roles Ryan Gosling and Richard Pitt play, but for now watch Murder By Numbers for its general appeal as a criminal psychology thriller.",1033344000,,1383,5.12
1446380,3,B00005JL29,"""Murder by Numbers"" is an okay thriller that provides a decent way to pass a dull evening. One suspects that it is not nearly as good as its makers had hoped it would be. The weaknesses lay in a script that gives us neither especially interesting characters nor many intriguing twists and turns. Even the `surprise' ending is fairly predictable. It's not that the movie isn't entertaining. It's that its impact is minimal and, thus, forgettable.
Two high school seniors [Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt], too smart for their own good and alienated by life in a small, affluent town, decide to commit the perfect murder. They pick not only a victim but also an unsuspecting friend to take the blame. There's only one hitch - one local homicide detective [Sandra Bullock] doesn't think that the carefully laid out crime scene evidence adds up. She and her less-than willing partner [Ben Chaplin] set out to find out the truth.
Everything about ""Murder by Numbers"" is competent. Bullock, Chaplin, Gosling and Pitt are quite convincing in their roles. If only their roles had had a little more substance to them, this might have been a quality thriller.",1033257600,5,1147,4.857142857142857

No, the problem here is the director and the script.  This film has its slight exciting moments, but it doesn't take advantage of them and sustain the excitement.  There are two false endings on this film and by the time the first one has hit, you're wishing the film would end, because it is really dragging.
Bullock's character, Mayweather, is on the hunt for the murderer(s) of a young woman left next to a creek.  She is haunted by this crime because she or someone else near and dear to her has had a terrible experience also near a creek ...Back to the basic plot....Two teenagers are responsible for the murder - we know this and we are supposed to know this.  This film is intended to allow us to understand the mind's of the killers and enjoy the forensic detective work done by Mayweather and her partner (Ben Chaplin).  The boys have committed the murder to prove that they can commit the perfect murder because of their superior intellect.
""Murder By Numbers"" is an updated remake of Hitchcock's ""Rope"".  The trouble is that the writers and director aren't up to the task.
This is a story that could have been told in thirty minutes or in a Law and Order episode - and to a much better degree...Ultimately, this film isn't worth watching.  For really exciting forensic detective work tune into ""CSI"" each week on television.  For a good version of this same plotline, rent Hitchcock's ""Rope""...",1033084800,,1681,4.60738255033557
1446382,3,B00005JL29,"There's nothing really wrong with ""Murder by Numbers"" - it's just that you've seen it all before. Sandra Bullock, in turtlenecks and authentically messy hair, plays tough Detective Cassie Mayweather, who with her neophyte partner Sam (Ben Chaplin) is called in to solve a murder case in a small California coastal town. A trail of clues leads them to two local teens whose alibis seem suspiciously airtight, but Cassie is determined that they are guilty of what might have been the perfect murder.
The film isn't an emotional thriller like ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but it does have some interesting, smart characters. Some will not like this film because it doesn't offer easy answers. It doesn't have the usual, pat Hollywood ending The film is pretty slow-moving, and it doesn't have much in the way of suspense or drama. It is more of a character study",1032998400,6,854,4.8561643835616435
1446383,2,B00005JL29,"Sadly not even the presence of Sandra Bullock can save this picture about a tortured police detective solving a murder. Together with her partner, played by Ben Chaplin, they pursue two teenage murderers. In a movie such as this, where the murderers are revealed almost from the first scene, rounded characters and a clever plot are a must. Murder By Numbers has neither. The murderers are intelligent and bored high school students and their characters never really evolve past this reality. Bullock's character is obsessed by past events and while affecting her character it does not seem to affect the plot. So why torture her if it serves no clear purpose?
Murder By Numbers was a startling movie waiting to happen. Unfortunately between a disconnected plot and underdeveloped characters it never found its legs.
This is a two star movie because I hope that some young genius writer/director will take a look at it, see its flaws, and then be able to bring to the screen what this movie should have been.",1032912000,2,1008,4.866279069767442

Murder by Numbers is a suspenseful drama that truely kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.  It adresses the issues of trust and makes one question if they really know who their friends are.  Two teenagers think that are invisible to the world and can follow through with the perfect murder.  Little do they realize that they will be each other's downfall.  The cast is well suited for the film, and Sandra Bullock does a great job playing a more serious role of a cop, who herself has an unmentionable past.

Also, I noticed that the film dragged on a bit at the start & that the love/bed scene was quite inappropriate or rather unnecessary for the plot development.
Well, the ending kind'a made up for the film's shortfalls with its unexpected 'twist' & Cassie's (final) acceptance of her past in order for her to move on with her life.
No matter how I like Sandra (I've watched all her films), I wouldn't have watched this film in the big screen.  It's something you rent & view not keep.

It wasn't an especially excellent movie, but I was impressed by an actress then not previously too familiar to me, Sandra Bullock. She seemed like a sweet and disarming actress with a proverbial ""girl-next-door"" image. Wow, how things change. Her more recent films have increasingly turned into vanity projects of the like of TWO IF BY SEA, FORCES OF NATURE, 28 DAYS, MISS CONGENIALITY and now MURDER BY NUMBERS. This latter one is supposed to be a murder mystery, but that element really gets mostly smothered by the film's being a heavy handed angst-trip for Bullock's character. We're supposed to cheer her on as a shrewd detective, despite some erratic behavior that includes what would be called serious heavy-handed sexual harrassment of her partner if the genders were reversed. In any event, she's portrayed as the only one who knows what's going on, stuck in a workplace full of stereotypical dumb males, all clueless to what's happening right under their proverbial noses. Later she seems to show some compassion for one of the suspects, looking at him as possibly somewhat redeemable. This becomes the first genuinely human moment in the film that I could significantly buy into. But any hope of this being a plot turn that goes anywhere is ditched to still another twist. The final twist brings it back to being all about Bullock's character and her angst-trip, with the resolution of that occupying the final scene as if all else in the movie were irrelevant.",1027987200,4,1562,4.853932584269663

The film is about Cassie Mayweather, a female cop, who chases after two young boys (brilliant: Pitt and Gosling) to find the truth about the murder of a young woman.
The characters of the boys are well written but the character of Cassie is not. I had no business caring about her. But I did because of Bullock. How does she do that? She's very low key. She's so natural she seemes to be remembering a scene rather than playing it. She never overacts. She creates a sensation that although a scene may seem absurd to us, it seemes perfectly real to her. And we buy it. The movie is effective in slow and silent way but still I liked it.

So i wanted to see how he would fare in this mainstream big-budget film. Mike is basically the film, he played the character of high school student Justin with a brilliant intensity, that made you want to watch nothing but him, I hope he doesn't fall into the 'teen idol' bracket like many young actors do as he is worth MUCH more than that, however he is still quite off-beat for most audiences i suppose. Anyway in the film, I feel that the plot of Sandra Bullock (Cassie) and her husband could've been explored more fully, and I also felt that the relationship between the two killers Justin and Richard (Ryan Gosling) could've had more screen time, as it was the most interesting thing about this film. It was controlling, posessive, almost as if it was a kind of love. Sandra Bullock doesn't pull off her role all that well opting to play a text book detective, and her partner, played by Ben Chaplin is wasted, left hanging in the backgroud...

1446441,2,B00005JL29,"Barbet Schroeder's ""Murder By Numbers"" a movie which I assume is trying to update the Leopold and Loeb murders does have it's moments. It does try to create something original. And, who knows, if I had not seen the Alfred Hitchcock film ""Rope"", years ago, would I have enjoyed this movie? Probably not.
 Sandra Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather. A once married woman, whom after a bad marriaged, which landed her husband in jail, has since become a cop. And know must track down what police believe to be a serial killer, who, for the moment seems to have  committed the perfect crime. It was this part of the film I enjoyed. But, the writer of the film had something else up his sleeve. A very bad sub-plot concerning Bullock and her husband. I won't give it all away, but, it explains how bad the marriage was, why Bullock became a cop, and, why her husband has went to jail and the reason for her not going to testify against him. But this sub-plot sometimes takes away time from the, what I felt was the MAIN story-line to the film. The murder committed by these two young boys; Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). Seeing the way these two guys think and their actions was far more interesting to me then seeing Sandra Bullock over coming some old demmons in her closet. Could the sub-plot of work with a film like this? Maybe, but it would have to be handled in a much better way. There have been movies about cops who have old secrets in the closet and go on with a murder case. This year's ""Insomnia"" is a film that comes to mind. But in this film, the sub-plot concerning Bullock just throws the film off focus. The two stories do not coincide with each other. And because of that the film does not have the impact the director thought it would.
 But still the film does have it's moments. This my pick for Bullock's best acting performance since, well, it's her best performance. There seemed to be something there between Ben Chaplin, who plays a rookie cop helping Bullock on the case, and Bullock. Gosling and Pitt did a nice job with their roles as well. And some parts did add a nice level of suspense. But, everything this film does has been handled much better in the past. Watch Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and see. The film is worth looking at if your a Bullock fan, but, by looking at the numbers this film grossed, I wouldn't say there are many. The film fell short of 20 million dollars to make any profit. ** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: Although Bullock gives a very good perforamnce and the film does have some originality to it, it's sub-plot takes the film off track. Nice try though.",1025913600,,2633,4.490605427974947

She is cynical as well as spiteful - and subjects men to humiliation. Her latest muse is her rookie partner Ben Chaplin in a thankless role.
Murder by Numbers is essentially Bullock's star vehicle to feature her as a serious actress. She is tough and spare but when her trauma becomes too overwrought and grossly indulged, it butchers the movie to become a melodrama. Director Barbet Schroeder is at his best when deftly constructing the thriller part - closing in on a perfect murder scheme masterminded by a pair of high-school seniors. Cassie engages into a cat-and-mouse game to examine their strangled victim dumped in a river, ward off their deliberately set-up ruse and fence off their advances. The killing seems random but Cassie suspects it to be planned.
Inspired by the 1924 case of Leopold and Loeb which is the source of Hitchcock's Rope, Murder by Numbers is a why-dun-it hence the suspense is left to the grisly atmosphere imbued by Schroeder. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt pitch their acting skills to a visceral mode, charging their performance with homo-erotic tension. Gosling is the arrogant Congressman's son with scornful virulence; Pitt is the reclusive nerd who is overshadowed by the cool kid Gosling. The boys' Nietzchean dance of death is eerie and morbid - and Schroeder of Reversal of Fortune paints the deranged with darkness.
Murder by Numbers is thus a promising thriller only let down by the unfocused story-line when it wanders to Cassie's abused past. The pace may be slow but the ride there is one glossed by exceptional performances from the cast.",1022371200,,1798,4.996666666666667

There was a great amount of sexual attention between the characters Cassie (Bullock) and Richard (Gosling) that definetley added to the plot twists.  Anyone who did not want to beat the snot out of Richard right up until the very end of this movie is crazy.

The plot of ""MBN"" is only a little more complex than a ""Law and Order"" episode, and that is the film's downfall. Promised a psychological thriller of the serial variety by the film's trailer and the film's name, prospective viewers are misled into thinking the film will be more than it really is.  In this, it resembles ""The Panic Room"".  Unlike ""Law and Order"", director Barbet Schroeder (of the more suspenseful ""Single White Female"") creates the mood with complex relationships between the characters.  The film begins by telling us that the murder was committed by two wealthy teenagers, and with that element of suspense gone, it is difficult for Schroeder to convey the anxiety and thrills that the trailer promised.  Still, Schroeder does a capable job of keeping the audience guessing on the ambiguities of what drove the boys to commit the murder, and what compels Bullock to keep going when the case appears to be solved. .  Bullock is trying to expand her career in screen comedy and light romance to dramatic roles; tough to do when your screen persona is, ""cute"".
Bullock will surprise you in this film; ever the cynic, she plays Cassie, a detective that no one likes due to her overdeveloped ego and underdeveloped sense of the politically correct.  Thorough and driven, she is tasked with breaking in a new partner, Sam (Ben Chaplin), and teaching him about how to solve a homicide. Chaplin just kind of ""exists"" in the film, and the viewer never really identifies with him.
 The murderers have not only concealed their identity, they have left small forensic clues that lead the detectives to the wrong man, and thus, the crime is solved.  Cassie, who's been aggressive sexually with Sam, is angry when he brings this conclusion to the case.  She doubts the pat outcome and continues to try to trap the real murderers.  One of the elements that makes the film somewhat tedious is the continuous backstory of Cassie's past; and while it is supposed to give us insight into why she is the way she is, it really just gets in the way of the investigation.  You get the feeling that Schroeder sort of tacked it on to the film because forces behind the movie wanted more focus on Bullock and less on supporting characters.  Mistake.
What is masterful about the film is the supporting performances of the two young killers.  Young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt (Richard and Justin) are terrific in their roles. Gosling particularly unnerves you with his chemistry with all the other players. Richard & Justin's  actions and interactions are eerie, reminding you vaguely of the solitary and angry lives of the Columbine killers.  It isn't clear to the viewer just which of the two is manipulating the other as they plot the perfect murder by studying crime scene handbooks.  Are they seeking meaning to their lives?  Attention? A less boring existence than their wealthy and uninvolved parents can give them?  Their relationship has a homoerotic edge, and the film finishes without ever clearing up their motivation, perhaps the largest element of suspense that the film has.
Worth watching, but not Schroeder's best.  Bullock redeems herself as a more versatile actress, and the stage is set for a future breakout role for either Pittman or Gosling.",1020038400,3,3327,4.877442273534636
1446518,2,B00005JL29,"Before the summer of 2002, many thrillers were released promising thrills and chills. Such titles as ""Panic Room"" and ""Frailty"" talked the talk and walked the walk, but Barbet Schroeder's ""Murder by Numbers"" will fail to scare you at all.
Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin are local detectives trying to figure out a case in which a dead woman's body shows up out of nowhere in the middle of the forest. ""Murder by Numbers"" - as quickly as it intrigues you - drops you off for a marathon. We learn that the murder has been done by two high school students; Richard (Bryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Richard is the rich, cool kid that seems to be the murderer while Justin is the goth punk who is the brains behind the murder...or so we think. This is where Bullock and Chaplin comes in. Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, called the ""Hyena"" (for her strong will and manly attitde) and Ben Chaplin plays the green Sam Kennedy, Mayweather's latest partner in a string of partners. Apparently Mayweather goes through partners like water.
As the movie progresses (slowly) we learn more and more about the dynamic child killer duo and more especially Mayweather (Bullock). She is more of a manly character, as she seduces and then pulls away Kennedy (Chaplin). ""Murder By Numbers"" then loses its pull by long, strained flashbacks and plans. Somewhere, Mayweather and Kennedy come in, and things start to develop.
""Murder By Numbers"" is nowhere near the caliber of thrillers of 2002. While Bullock pulls her load, Chaplin blandly wavers through the film. The suprise performance is that of Gosling, who weasels and sweet-talks his way throughout the entire movie until he meets his fate. His counterpart, Pitt, looks like someone who wore too much gel on the set and constantly sweats -not a good thing. Schroeder, acclaimed international producer, does not perform well at all here behind the camera. His shots are simple and look more like something out of ""Law and Order"". The editing job is poor as well. For example, in one shot, Justin walks in a hallway when it is light outside, and as he walks into his room, it is dark.
""Murder By Numbers"" is saved only by Bullock's performance as she comes to bear on who she really is. The film itself is slow and lags through the majority of the feature.",1019952000,9,2299,4.75
1446519,4,B00005JL29,"When I say controversial director I mean a director with a unique and creative flair for developing subject matter to be seen in a new and exciting way. Sometimes the material he works with can be sobering but different in its style and process. This movie is definately a hollywood style movie but because of the direction by this interesting director it becomes more than. I liked the interaction between the characters. The movie took on more depth because the director caught the realness of the characters. I am not sure how to express this but I could identify with the characters. The two young actors who are trying to find amusement because life has become to boring and staid and needs some livening up want to commit a perfect murder, outwitting the police. I think the boredom that places the subject of murder into motion between the two teens brings excitement in their lives, excitement also be channeled into sexual energy or vice versa. The boys seemed to be drawn to each other in a sexual way. The energy between them feels sexual and really stimulates the viewer. This is what I mean about realness. The fact that two boys are drawn to one another usually doesn't catch me but in this movie it did! Also Bullock's character has a way of sparking up an overdone profile. The character she is portraying is an abused woman not dealing with her abuse and channeling her rage into work as a police woman and possible alcoholic. You know Bullock has took on roles that have to do with recovery, remember 28 days. I think she uses her talent to gain positive growth, maybe, maybe not. All this is, is a thought. Anyways, there are some cliches, the falling off the cliff, the ending where everything has to be spelled out, I hate that. I am sure some like. It bothers me when a point has to be driven, I like a more subtle approach. Again, Bullock has a way of delivering her lines that refreshes me and adds to the realness of the movie. I also like the fact they used some new faces or faces that have been out there but not used in many big hollywood takes, such as Michael Pitt and Ben Chaplin. The other actor that plays the part of the manipulative teen, not Justin, I thought also did a good job. His coolness stayed pretty constant and when he did break down, you could see the coolness struggling to keep composure. He was able to pull this off, which wins my praise. Someone said all he could do was raise his eyebrows and show an attitude, but I differ in that opinion. Anyways, Bullock still has a nice girl quality but the way she puts out her lines draw you and convince you her character is real. Chaplin's character is trying to remain detached, trying to be professional but slowly his character begins to melt. I wish he had more to his role but he did a good job with what he had. Well, I liked this movie and recommend it. It is not super unique but it has its moments, and the actors do a good job catching you up in the story. Which means theres a good director behind the scenes!

1446520,4,B00005JL29,"""Murder by Numbers"" belongs in that special category of thrillers in which the characters take precedence over the actual plot itself. The story line follows certain rules while breaking others, but in the end, it is the deep examinations of the people who populate the scenario that wins our utmost attention.
The film reminds me immensely of the early 1900's murder trial of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, two bright, astute boys who, for no clear reason, decided to murder a young boy in cold blood. Here, the action centers around an event that is very much the same in its calculation and detached feel. We are introduced to high school teenagers Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling), the rich and cocky aristocrat, and Justin (Michael Pitt), the loner who spends his time diffusing the workings of the law, from forensics to detective skills.
No sooner do we find out that these two completely opposite people are friends, than we learn that they have been planning a murder during the course of their friendship. We sense a feeling of hesitation eminating from Justin, as Richard placates him about his constant need for planning without any payoff. From such a scene, we are to gather that Justin is the brains while his partner is the brawn.
But it goes much deeper than first expected. There is a murder, that which we do not see, but discover as a crime scene is examined. There are various clues that, we gather, were left behind intentionally, from a strand of human hair to a carpet fabric from an unknown source. Later, we find that this ties in with their master plan of alluding the authorities to other sources and suspects.
Once things pick up after hard-hitting detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) takes on the case and begins questioning the two troubled youths, the film stops at various points to examine small glimpses of the two boys interacting with one another. Each boy feels he is being masterminded by the other, though it certainly appears as if Richard is having more of the fun. There are even hints at a possible homosexual relationship between the two: in one particular scene, after Justin becomes involved with a female classmate, Richard confronts him. Is he anxious about whether or not his partner in crime revealed any possible information, or is there a slight jealousy in his furor?
It's these examinations and poignant moments of feeling that make ""Murder by Numbers"" better than it would have been had it followed the regular cat-and-mouse formula for the genre. The plot itself does tend to sway into predictability, and even the film's opening sequence sets us up for later events to come, but director Barbet Schroeder manages to keep things moving at a fluid pace, introducing new evidence for Cassie to divulge, despite her insistant boss, who believes she is overdoing her work, and her partner, Sam (Ben Chaplin), who feels she holds a grudge after he cracks the case. Or so he thinks.
But Cassie refuses to let go of her belief in the two boys' guilt. Under Sandra Bullock's convincing performance, she makes an otherwise routine subplot involving a past trauma that ties her emotions to present events believable. Chaplin's character isn't given much to do during the film except provide emotional support for Bullock; on that, he succeeds admirably.
It is Gosling and Pitt who steal the show, however, bringing us into the complex, morbidly intriguing nature of their friendship so that we have a somewhat faded picture of their psyche. I like that fact that some elements of their friendship are left to suggestion through friendly gestures and embraces; it incites us to think about what motivates them. Does Justin do it to satisfy Ryan's lust for action? Why do these two souls choose to interact, even as their crime tears them apart emotionally? Deciphering questions like this is all part of the fun, and they make ""Murder by Numbers"" more than your garden-variety thriller.",1019692800,10,3941,4.9100449775112445
1446521,4,B00005JL29,"I love Sandra Bullock and her current film ""Murder By Numbers"" takes a bit to get going.  Here's the real deal, 2 high school kids played by Michael Pitt (Hedwig & The Angry Inch) and newcomer Ryan Gosling really did or didn't have their hands in a recent murder case?  The usual steps of gathering information at the crime scene eventually leads up to Pitt & Gosling.  Bullock and Ben Chaplin play homcide investigators trying to figure out if the two boys are telling the truth or lying.  Will Pitt and Gosling stick to their story as planned or defy each other and turn the other one in?  Towards the climatic ending had me at the edge and who really did it got me fooled!",1019520000,3,675,4.368
1446522,5,B00005JL29,"This movie isn't boring.  It's actually telling people about how the ""perfect murder"" can be achieved without being caught.  And aside from this, it tells of Cassie Mayweather, and her frightening past.  This movie does tell who the murderers are in the beginning, but the real thing you have to figure out is WHO actually did the killing.  This movie is one (of many) of Sandra Bullock's all best....It'll keep you on the edges of your seats.",1019347200,,443,4.714285714285714
1446523,3,B00005JL29,"Barbet Schroeder seems to make two types of films: those meant for the art/independent houses (even though there is a definite blurring of these films into the mainstream)such as ""Our Lady of the Assassins,"" and those meant to be popular entertainments such as ""Single White Female"" and his current ""Murder by the Numbers."" His best film though, is still ""Reversal of Fortune,"" which falls in between the cracks of his filmography yet still manages to be his most cogent, satiric and intelligent film to date.
""Murder by the Numbers"" stars Sandra Bullock as the hard as nails and sexually voracious Cassie Mayweather, a homicide detective with an edgy past, assigned to solve a muder case that might involve two high school students: the sinister and edgy Ryan Gosling (late of ""The Believer"") and the sensitive and smarmy Michael Pitt (late of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch).
In fact, even though both Bullock and Ben Chaplin acquit themselves well in their roles, it is Gosling and Pitt that literally steal the show. Gosling and Pitt's scenes together bristle with sexual energy bordering on the homoerotic and their connection is palpable due to the very extraordinary nature of their relationship which I can only describe as one very much like that of Arthur Penn's version of Bonnie and Clyde with all the psychological tics in place; which is not to say that Bullock does not have her own demons to work through...because she does. It's just that the boy's demons are a hell of a lot more interesting.
Schroeder holds the whole enterprise together as well as he can but he obviously has more of an affinity to and interest in the Gosling/Pitt relationship than he does to the Bullock/Chaplin one. The ending is standard issue thriller and therefore a letdown but the mind reels at the idea of a Gosling/Pitt remake of the Leopold and Loeb story directed by the estimable Schroeder.",1019347200,,1886,4.878504672897196
1446524,4,B00005JL29,"All in all I liked this movie! Sort of a now thing to do, crime investigation end of the murders. Where you get the details. The plot is good and kudos go for the teenage actors, as they were great.
Ryan Gosling,( Remember The Titans) did an outstanding job as the leader and bully of the two teens. While Michael Pitt (Hedweg And The Angry Inch), and Bully, played the submissive know-it-all-geek. They are in their senior year , and they plot to murder someone as the ultimate part of being. Which brings to mind the Loeb, Leopold murder movie, (Compulsion).
The script bounces around enough to keep you interested. And the twists and turns are really not that predictable, no matter what other reviewers say. The two teens have a pseudo-homosexual relationship and you can see Ryans fondness for Michael in the way he holds Michael close to him after raging at him. Michael is mesmerized by Ryan, but does not return the fondness. One gets the feeling that something had happened earlier in their childhood, as Michael tells the girl he is going out with, ""I wish I had met you first""
Ben Chaplin, (Thin Red Line, and Birthday Girl) has the potential to be a great actor, and why he does not get a good place on this billing roster is puzziling to me. He has the looks, but needs to get out of his shell and do something really crazy like, (Urbania, or The World And Time Enough,  Bird Cage), something zany!! He is way to serious.
Sandra Bullock (Miss Congenialty, 28 Days), also needs to break the mold she has put herself in, you can anticipate her every move and facial expression....she is good in this film but, predictable.
There are no perfect films, one can always expect to find some flaws and this film is no exception. What one hops for is 'that the flaws are few and far between.
I gave this flick a ****!

7939155,4,B00005JL29,"Intellectually challenging mysteries such as MURDER BY NUMBERS as written by Tony Gayton and directed with great skill by Persian director Barbet Schroeder are such a fulfilling evening of theater, especially when the story includes philosophy, the psychology of injured minds from past abuse, and the clever means of a planned murder! This picture from 2002 continues to satisfy on every level  especially with the superb performances by Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin, Ryan Gosling, Michael Pitt an done of the better supporting casts assembled by casting director Howard Feuer.

In a strange little coastal town in California Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling9, a handsome, cocky, wealthy high school cool kid, secretly teams up with another rich kid in his class, brilliant nerd Justin 'Bonaparte' Pendleton (Michael Pitt), whose erudition, specially in forensic matters, allows them to plan elaborately perfect murders, just for the kick, for which they set up Richard's marijuana supplier, their school's janitor Ray Feathers, as a psychotic serial killer. The case is assigned to detectives Cassie 'the hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock), a crime scene specialist who carries a huge chip on the shoulder from an abusive relationship that has haunted her for years, and her brilliant new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who just transferred from the vice squad; they can work together very well, and even fit romantically, but fall out over different professional attitudes towards the investigation, which Captain Rod Cody (R.D. Call) and her understandably vindictive abused ex, Assistant D.A. Al Swanson (Tom Verica), soon ban her from when she disobeys instructions and hand to him. When the plotting boys both attempt to attract classmate Lisa Mills (Agnes Bruckner), their unnatural bond comes under stress  and the manner in which the relationship crumbles and further deaths occur makes for a spine-tingling end.

The musical score by Clint Mansell and the cinematography by Luciano Tovoli enhance the mood of the film, but in the end it is a solid story acted by a very polished cast that makes this one of those must see again type films. Grady Harp, January 18",1517184000,,2174,5.292753623188406

7939159,5,B00005JL29,"I LOVE this movie. Ms. Bullock, Mr. Gosling and Mr. Pitt were all PHENOMENAL.  I'm really sorry for the ""haters"" that missed what great dramatic acting there is within this film. I am happy to see Ms. Bullock acting such a gritty and difficult part.
The two young males are classic works of art...Michael and Ryan... have moved on to tremendous works since this film was made. And, to Ms. Bullock, Sandra, you are AMAZING!
Sorry to say, I think that only a closed-minded person could NEVER see, AND/or BELIEVE what a great movie this is.  Just have a look at how the careers of these three actors BLOSSOMED after the release of this film, (excepting Ms. Bullock, who'd been amazing for quite SOME YEARS, at this point).

It was interesting enough to keep my interest and I enjoyed seeing Ryan Gosling in this role. It was well acted. I just thought there were too many ""hollywood"" plot holes that didn't make sense. I couldn't get over the fact that I doubt that any investigator would allow interrogation of a minor. I guess I watched too much Law and Order to know that wouldn't fly. Also I wish they covered why these teens were the way they were and showed their relationship with their parents. This had great potential like many other movies in this genre, but  it fell kinda flat overall. Especially the ending. Honestly its really hard to find a great movie in this genre. Silence of the Lambs. The Red Dragon. Seven. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Zodiac. These movies are excellent.",1508716800,,902,4.401197604790419
