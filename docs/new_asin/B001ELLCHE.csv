8435954,4,B001ELLCHE,"This short film follows an Army NCO as he is selected for Drill Sergeant School, completes the course at Fort Leonard Wood and is assigned to a basic training company. Filmed in the 1960s, this program looks at the changes taking place at the time. Basic training was reduced to eight weeks, but the course was far more intense. The candid footage is excellent but there are parts which appear to be staged. Very educational, though.

Filmed in full color. It is also unusual in that MSG Queen does not appear in the program.",1384905600,,525,4.585106382978723
