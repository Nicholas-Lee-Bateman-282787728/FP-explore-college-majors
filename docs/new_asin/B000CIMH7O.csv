8099070,3,B000CIMH7O,"Angel in Love (Zakochany Aniol) (2005), is a romantic comedy from Polish director Artur Wiecek, who also directed the previous Angel in Krakow (2002).

Giordano (Krzysztof Globis), an angel living in Krakow, is impacted by a heavenly downsizing and is changed into a human. He has a tough time adjusting to his new circumstances and seeks counseling from psychotherapist, Roma (Anna Radwan). Giordano falls head-over-heals for the attractive panna and tries to win her affection with the help of his good friend, Szajbus (Jerzy Trela), and his housekeeper/nanny, Irena (Marta Bizon). Roma improbably falls for the good-hearted stumblebum after Giordano's  ex-employers take pity on his situation and pull a few strings.

Angel in Love has its moments and is definitely worth a watch. I chuckled more than a few times. Globis does a fine job. Anna Radwan is absolutely cute as a button. Jerzy Trela gives a great comic performance and manages to steal the show.  Sonia Bohosiewicz provides the requisite eye candy as Roma's best friend but I'm a bigger fan of Sonia's younger siostra, Maja Bohosiewicz. Lovely Dorota Segda has a small but entertaining cameo as a prostitute hired by Szajbus to educate Giordano in the ways of love. One of my favorite Polish actors, Janusz Gajos, has a small part in the hilarious abduction of Giordano from a psychiatric hospital, where his roommate had revealed that he was actually Elvis Presley, a fact kept secret by an ""international Judeo-Masonic conspiracy."" Ha, ha, ha. Screenwriter Witold Beres certainly knows how to break the chops of Radio Maryja listeners! Angel in Love was filmed mainly in Krakow and the historic and picturesque city often serves as a backdrop. Brace yourself; one of the last scenes of the movie when Giordono breaks into a song and dance is absolutely regrettable.",1361059200,,1832,5.096666666666667
8099071,4,B000CIMH7O,"This is a charming romantic comedy - sweet, wonderful, and even a little spicy. Giordano is an angel who is taking care of an orphan.  The staff in Heaven decides it is time for STAGE TWO, and cut off all his angel powers.  Since this happens to Giordano without notice, he suffers a complete nervous breakdown and is sent to a mental ward in Warsaw.  Saved by a friend, he struggles with his new identity and then falls in love with his therapist.  Luckily, the staff at HEAVEN ONE is cooperative and
smoothes his road to love.  The cast is just perfect for this kind of comedy.  A neat film.",1173225600,2,593,4.345454545454546
