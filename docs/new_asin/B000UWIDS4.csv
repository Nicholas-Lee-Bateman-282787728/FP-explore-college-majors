8215369,3,B000UWIDS4,This video has not sound and is made up of segments of video of soviet naval vessels sailing the seas.  It is interesting in so far as you obtain a chance to see the ships up close and in operating which you do not normally see in civilian life.  I have not seen them in any other video either.  So I would have to say it was worth the $ 15 price.  My recommendation would be that the national archives have a naval officer narrate the type of ships scene and their capabilities and whether or not Russia still possesses these particular ships.,1439596800,,544,4.252427184466019
