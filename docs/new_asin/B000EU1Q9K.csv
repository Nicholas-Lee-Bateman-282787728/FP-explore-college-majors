8114428,3,B000EU1Q9K,"Yep, I'm calling it Slaughterhouse Pie because there's a lot of cute dishes in this one. Yes, it's shot direct to DVD and the acting is typical B-Horror (e-gads! what a shock!) but it was fun and there were so many homages to the Slumber Party Massacres, High Night, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama and the Burning. Randal Malone's detective reminded me of the gumshoe from Fred Olan Ray's classic Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers (yay, a Linnea Quigley flick!) and he played it straight and sincere, though I would have had him a bit more gun-happy like Mel Gibson but I can't have everything. If low budget's not your bag then, please, look somewhere else.",1349568000,,664,4.782608695652174
8114429,2,B000EU1Q9K,"In the beginning the Tri Phi sorority house accidentally kills a pledge, or she has a heart attack, while they were sacrificing her to Satan. Rather than inform the authorities, they dump her in a creepy old burnt out orphanage. The initiation has the girls wearing bra/panties with stockings, heels and a cape. Not the worse fantasy costumes. The sheriff is overweight and sets off your gay-dar.

One year later the Tri Phi girls are having their pledge initiation in the same orphanage. You should know the rest. Acting was bad and at times comical. The plot, heck, you know it. The special effects include an echo machine, slow motion for running scenes, CG gun fire, fake blood and some fake gore.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity but lots of lingerie.",1315267200,,750,4.717557251908397
8114430,1,B000EU1Q9K,"I cannot believe the junk that is coming out on DVD claiming to be horror.  It's an insult to all of our great slasher flicks (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc...)  This movie was poorly produced, the actors had no acting ability whatsoever, the camera work was lousy, and the plot sucks.  Don't buy this for the hopes of seeing hot women either, they aren't there.  Nothing but homely women with sloppy bodies.  The weapon was PLASTIC too, nice touch!! A complete waste of time and money.",1201910400,,488,4.627906976744186
8114431,5,B000EU1Q9K,"For first time actors, this is a really good movie. All of the actors put a lot of time and effort into this movie. Plus, I'm really good friends with one of the Actresses named Cassie Daniels. Cassie really showed a lot of determination and it looked liked she went above and beyond to make her role as Tina very convincing. I wish her lots of luck in her acting carrer.",1178755200,,371,4.23943661971831
8114432,2,B000EU1Q9K,"This movie was okay and almost better. The acting was lacking. Some acted okay. Others sucked. They could have called this movie ""Dingbats Running"". Being a sucker for a romantic story in the middle of all the slashing, it would have added to the story if the nerd had gotten the girl in the end, instead of becoming just another victim. This movie had potential, but never reached it. Had I rented it, I would never have bought it, yet it was not a total waste, just as acting classes for some in the film would not be a total waste.",1160784000,,534,4.297029702970297
8114433,4,B000EU1Q9K,"The storyline is pretty good.  The cast is great looking.  If you are a fan a b-monster and indenpendent horror movies, this is the one for you.  It has everythig you want - a deformed monster, screaming and surprises.  Good movie.",1158105600,2,231,4.560975609756097
8114434,1,B000EU1Q9K,"Ehhhhh. What is this? This is one very stupid movie. How do I get a refund? There is no plot, the acting was beyond inept, the direction was nonexistant. This movie had a few hot looking babes but they didn't do anything....Did I mention the lack of plot or cohesive story-line? Did I mention this movie sucks?",1157328000,,310,4.456140350877193
8114435,5,B000EU1Q9K,slaughterhouse phi: death sisters is a thrilling horror film with a great story line.... its sexy cast will keep you on the edge your seat! this is definitely one of my favorite horror films of all time. i recommend it to everyone!,1150156800,,231,4.523809523809524
