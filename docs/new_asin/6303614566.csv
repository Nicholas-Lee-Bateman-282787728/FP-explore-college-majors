7851615,5,6303614566,"Absolutely impossible to resist, an amazing interview with Dennis Potter that is completely focused, despite Potter's need for morphine and champagne to mitigate the pain of his illness.  Watch this and learn about living.",1129507200,,222,5.529411764705882
7851616,5,6303614566,"This Channel 4 ""Without Walls"" special is probably the best television interview I have ever seen. Potter brings the very best out of Melvyn Bragg, one of the UK's most incisive and intelligent interviewers, and gives fully of himself in what he knew would be his last chance to say his piece about media, society and his own life and work. Bragg himself plays his part wonderfully, unobtrusively and sensitively supporting the frail writer throughout this most important of final tasks. As a valedictory postscript to a brilliant career and as an intimate conversation between two engaged thinkers, this programme is not to be missed.
The transcribed interview (also available) cannot, of course, fully capture what the camera has recorded for posterity: Potter's presence, his humour and the exemplary warmth, courtesy and gratitude he showed to Bragg and to the cameramen and engineers. All of this as his life ebbed away.
In my opinion it is this interview, more even than the final screenplays (Karaoke and Cold Lazarus) that he discusses, that puts the shining seal on Potter's cultural legacy.",1090022400,5,1100,5.116666666666666
7851617,5,6303614566,"Melvyn Bragg interviews the dying genius playwright Dennis Potter without maudlin and Potter responds without angst as he races death to finish his last duo of plays: Karioke and Cold Lazarus. Sipping morphine to ease the  pain of pancreatic cancer, he talks of the clarity and beauty of life that  impending death gives, only afraid that he may be cheated by the grim  reaper a few pages too early.
Even if you have never seen a Potter play  and so have never had the chance to appreciate how good TV drama can really  be, you will find this interview deeply moving and memorable. And  afterward, read the reviews of the Singing Detective; if you choose to buy  that too, you will almost certainly become one of the many with an  insatiable appetite for his work.",928972800,16,764,4.607407407407408
