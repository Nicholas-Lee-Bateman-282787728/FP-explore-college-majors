You can see the fake teeth, fake hair.  Sloppy computer graphics superimposed on people.  The werewolves look WORSE than movies from the early 80's.  Video games today look incredibly realistic, yet this flop could not pull off a single werewolf.

If you cannot make a realistic werewolf or a terrifying change, DON'T MAKE A WEREWOLF MOVIE!!!  If I put two dead fish on my bare feet and jumped into a pool, you would think I was a mermaid before you thought these atrocities were werewolves.

That said, the story had potential.  Could have been a decent horror movie with better writers, effects, etc.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Howwwwwoooooo did this crap get made?",1422662400,,833,4.978102189781022
5652793,1,B00BMUL966,"The only thing interesting about this rubbish flick is that some of it was filmed in the Buffalo Central Terminal (1929), a former railroad station in Buffalo, New York. You get to see the exterior, the Office tower, the baggage building and the yard.  The 17-story Art Deco style station is awesome, if you're an architecture buff, that's the only reason to sit through this junk.",1404691200,,381,4.7727272727272725

5652795,1,B00BMUL966,This movie really BITES! I mean that literally! Was a waste of money. I could only get through a few minutes of it and shut it off! Geeze....,1381190400,,141,4.071428571428571
5652796,2,B00BMUL966,"Battledogs has a premise that lends itself to being a totally fun over the top schlockfest. All of Manhattan at risk of turning werewolf?? A corrupt general trying to use the virus to create super soldier dogs of war?? And a cast NOT culled from the bottom of the barrel?? I couldn't wait to pop this one in.

The werewolves did look decent considering the budget, and the makeup effects on the injured victims were great too. Would have liked to see more of the transformations, but I guess they just couldn't get a workable effect down with the budget.

Unfortunately, it focuses primarily on the ""corrupt general"" aspect and not so much on the WEREWOLVES BATTLEDOGS aspect. Besides the opening outbreak, there is very little action in the first 45 minutes, and once all hell breaks loose and the dogs are set on N.Y.... most of the action involves our protagonists having to fight off corrupt soldiers and not werewolves. There is painfully little werewolf action.

Once you get around that, it's actually not a totally unwatchable low-budget thriller (assuming you recognize that this is from Asylum not Warner Brothers and know what to appropriately expect). The pace is a bit slow at times, and understanding the production you could pick apart the story all day long, but it's not like you can't have some fun with this movie. It has some good moments once it gets its legs halfway through.

I just can't give it higher marks though because of the monumental lack of werewolves... They put hordes of the things in New York, mark it up as a major premise of the film, but then they become a complete aside to stopping the bad guy general's agenda. The heroes only have TWO encounters with werewolves while running through a city that is said to have HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of these things. We get a brief battle with the Army versus a massive horde, and that's about it. So much for Battledogs!",1379808000,,1899,4.676646706586826
