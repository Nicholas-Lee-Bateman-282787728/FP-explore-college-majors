8035283,1,B0002ZH71I,"Showtime will release the fourth season of ""Queer as Folk"" on DVD sometime in February 2005.  There is no guarantee as to the quality of this bootleg version.  It was probably copied from the Showtime broadcasts.  Be patient and wait for the real thing,",1102204800,17,253,4.704545454545454
8035284,5,B0002ZH71I,"You gotta love this show every year it just gets better and better. I own every season now and I will continue to own everyone to come. The DVD itself was nicely packaged, and I thought the quality was excellent. I'm not sure what the difference is between and Import and the US version. Except maybe blooper and missing scenes.",1097884800,9,328,4.483333333333333
8035285,5,B0002ZH71I,"I watched this season first on Showtime, and it was amazing then. I just purchased this set and I loved it. I have been watching this season over and over again. My favorite episode is the one where Brian is in the bike race. I won't say more in case you haven't seen it. That episode makes me cry everytime I watch it. I think I am just like Sharon Glass' charcter on the show my son is gay and I love him to death. I am 60 years old and I love this DVD set, I thought the DVD quality was great, and the packaging was top knoch. If you love this show then you'll love this DVD set!",1096243200,7,582,3.8583333333333334
8035286,4,B0002ZH71I,"i have been waiting for season 4 to come out on dvd for months and months. Living in Australia, the series won't air on television until January 2005. As soon as i saw it was available , i snapped it up and it arrived about 1 week ago. It's so obvious that this particular edition i got was recorded onto a dvd burner straight from the showtime network,..the logo even appears on the bottom of the screen. A couple of the episodes had occasional audio and visual faults and overall the quality of the recording is about 75% of the official QAF dvd box sets. There appears to be quite a bit of pixellation with the image if you sit too close to the screen. If you are a junkie and need to see it as soon as possible,.then get this,.but if you can wait , you're probably better off waiting for the offical showtime network season 4 dvd box set.",1095638400,34,842,4.236024844720497
8035287,5,B0002ZH71I,"I loved this show and the DVD. I thought the DVD quality was good for an imported DVD. This was a cool season of Queer as Folk. I love how the characters change with the story. I just bought a new surround sound system and it sounds great with this DVD which must also be in surround. I loved watching Brian and Justin have sex in surround. It is so hot. The only thing that I didn't like about the DVD set was that there were no Deleted Scenes or Special Features. Other then that the video and audio were just about as good as the non-imported Queer As Folk DVD seasons I own. Which now I own all the seasons but season 1. I can't wait for season five! Please showtime, if you are reading this, :) don't ever cancel this show! I would reccomend this DVD set to anyone.",1095206400,3,770,4.105960264900662
