8383598,5,B002XC1X1I,"This is just a wonderful example of a master artist sharing the gained knowledge of experience. The DVD is assembled into chapters that make it very easy to follow and understand. Sometimes instructional DVDs have left me feeling like I didn't quite get all the information that I wanted or needed to reproduce the results. That is definitely not the case with this DVD.  You can truly reproduce the amazing results that are achieved in this DVD by following the detailed instructions.

If you want to learn how to pit fire and burnish, I highly recommend getting this DVD.",1260835200,3,573,4.777777777777778
