1885709,4,B00009NH8L,This movie was made as if it was shot by a home camera.  A lot of forced acting by not so forceful actors.  If you are looking for a great laugh - then this is the DVD to get.,1353456000,,175,3.4615384615384617
1885710,1,B00009NH8L,"Supposedly based upon the life of Ozark matriarch Ma Barker and her four felonious public enemy sons, this meanly made low budget example of drive-in movie schlock actually treats several incidents in the real-life career of the notorious Barker/Karpis Gang which was very active during 1931/35 from the Midwest into Southeast U.S., but so contorts the truth in order to create a lurid melodrama that a viewer is alienated from the proceedings, especially in light of obvious cut-rate production values. Al Karpis was the confirmed master hand behind the Gang's string of sinful successes whereas the factual Ma Barker, although enjoying holding open house for various fugitives, only travelled with her family and was patently incapable of organizing more than luncheons, whereas in this poorly scripted travesty Lurene Tuttle as a tommygun wielding sadistic sociopath performs a raft of maniacal actions, including running over a policeman twice, all while planning the Gang's adventures and serving up heist advice to respectful triggermen such as John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly and Baby Face Nelson.",1121385600,6,1106,5.436046511627907

7992008,4,B00009NH8L,"PLOT: MA Barker....the brains of this GANG has grey hair. and Gangbusters: escape is what he does best.

MA BARKER: cheaply made with bad acting this still keeps us glued to the end. Lurene Tuttle uses her boys to ""get ahead"" by stealing...she plots the crime and the boys do the deed. NO actors we have heard of except....Don Grady....(My Three Sons) as one of the boys in childhood. MA is so good at ""planning"" the crimes even Pretty Boy Floyd wants to join her gang. Cheap tacky sets but worth the watch once.
GANGBUSTERS: far the better of the two movies worth buying for this movie alone. PUBLIC enemy #4...yeah #4....LOL is an escape artist who makes clean get away out of the big house several times. John Omar....even has extra guards watching him and he still gets out...the fun is the escapes and the cons who aid his plans. this is definitely a ""C"" movie but fun from beginning to end from the bad acting to the cops who are far less smart than Omar....look out for his ONE armed get up he uses as a ruse to hide a gun under his coat. I give them both 4 stars ....",1396569600,,1075,4.295566502463054

7992010,5,B00009NH8L,"Petite character actress Lurene Tuttle OWNS this film as she chews up the scenery and just about everyone in the cast here. I have various TV episodes with this lady on DVD, but never have I seen her play a part like Ma Barker. Okay, I'm not looking for accurate history here any more than in Mommie Dearest, and the film works for me on that level. The film is a hoot, and will liven up a dull evening for those who like over-the-top camp.",1380672000,,440,4.188235294117647

7992012,1,B00009NH8L,Ma Barkers Killer Brood is nothing but fictional piece of crap. The acting is 3rd rate.  Stay away from this horrible movie!,1369267200,,124,4.636363636363637
