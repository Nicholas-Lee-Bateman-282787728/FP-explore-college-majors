8360008,5,B002AQDDS8,"My kids have been watching this Bible series for years, and even the 8 year old still likes it well-enough.  I wish they had their stories in either biblical order or chronological order, but they aren't.  Apart from that, I have little to complain about.  Their renditions are faithful-enough to the scripture, and my kids have learned a lot from them.  They also give the kids enough material in which to ask questions--which (I think) is great.  In this day, we can't afford to be passive in the raising of our kids; so I choose to be proactive in raising these kids with a Christian world-view, and this is but one tool in which to do so.",1375660800,,642,4.452991452991453
