5690728,5,B00C4XV58W,"I bought this dvd for visiting grandson, who loves it.  Discovered that grandpa loves it too!  They both enjoy watching it together.  Good choice.  If you like the first Kung Fu Panda, you'll enjoy this one as well.",1372291200,7,215,4.578947368421052
5690729,5,B00C4XV58W,"Our kids love pandas, and Kung Fu Panda.  Now, with the continuing tales of Po out on DVD, they really devour these silly, colorful, well done shorts- perhaps even more than the full length, Jack Black, releases.

They  include only 7 of the more than 40 episodes from 2011-13; however, they run about 20 minutes each and pack in a lot of Dragon Warrior action and goofiness.  Indeed, our kids can't help but giggle as jelly-belly, not quite orthodox, Po shows off his one part mighty fighter, three parts silly panda.

The rest of the gang and Furious Five are there, and I can't really tell the changes in voices from the movies.  Mick Wingert, voice actor, does a great job sounding like Po; no Angelina here for Tigress, but she still has that fierce, sultry, no nonsense way about her. Voiced by actress, Kari Wahlgren.

Po battles Crocs and even an evil self with a Zen-like, make a mess of it first, quality.  There's a bit of a moral to each story, but it's the humor and neat graphics that make these super Pandalicious! ...Sorry.  Kids give it a big thumbs up.  They need to release the whole series.",1372118400,14,1110,4.505
5690730,5,B00C4XV58W,"I love these episodes. They are funny and entertaining, and there are many of them! I just want Kung-Fu Panda 1-2 + mini-series + legends of awesomeness to be released in one mega-package on 4K blu-ray! Other than that the only thing that i don't like is the intro. I don't like the song.",1393632000,2,288,4.351851851851852
5690731,5,B00C4XV58W,My grandson who is 10 watches this dvd over and over again. He really does like it. I would recommend it.,1392595200,3,105,4.0476190476190474
5690732,5,B00C4XV58W,"There are some animated adventures that surpass normal expectations.  This is one of those movies.  It is perfect!  It can rival many Japanese Animae adventures.

Thank you

5690735,4,B00C4XV58W,"My grand boys loved Kung Fu Panda and all the characters he associates with...they watch this almost anytime they are over.  The boys are 4+ and 2+.  More for the 4+ year old then the 2+ year old, but he likes it also.",1377129600,,218,4.046511627906977
5690736,5,B00C4XV58W,"My 9 and 12 year old grandsons (and I) loved Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness.  When they laugh out loud many times while watching a dvd, I rate it a 5.  This doesn't happen too often because so many of the newer movies are moronic and boring or have inappropriate language and content in them even though they are kids' movies. If there were any bad words in this dvd, they slipped by me!  I think they also enjoyed ""Awesomeness"" so much because they love Lego Ninjago--it has similar settings plus we liked all of the characters in it.",1376956800,4,542,4.4

8577336,5,B00C4XV58W,"My son absolutely loves Kung Fu Panda; I purchased these for those rainy days when we cannot go outside and play or when we have finished reading a few books. He can watch Kung Fu Panda, no matter the episode, over and over again.",1402876800,4,230,4.25
8577337,5,B00C4XV58W,"We have Kung Fun Panda 1 and 2, but these Legends of Awesomeness are great!
All 3 kids (ages 2, 4, 6) love the episodes. We don't have Nickelodeon, so they have never seen
these shows. The shows each teach something that is great for kids to learn. The time for each episode
fits in well, too, so that they can watch just 1 before going to bed and being satisfied with that.
Jack Black is great to continue doing this! The kids love the theme song and sing it often!",1395964800,4,466,4.131868131868132
