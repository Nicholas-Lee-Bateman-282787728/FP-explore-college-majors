7826198,3,6302464927,"Bugs Bunny has always put his crazy antics among several villians. Truth or Hare, contains five cartoons that truly show an domain of laughter.
The Fair Haired Hare- By Friz Freleng, sees Yosemite Sam, living in an house with Bugs, by court order. Until Sam tries an stunt, that actually makes both sides happy. Sam winds up with an cabin in the sky. - 6 1/2 out of 10.
Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare- by Bob McKimson, was the final cartoon with Taz in Warner Brothers in the golden era of animation. Bugs tricks Taz into being hurt, and turns it into an bunch of medical mayhem. Ending with an monster they both created that hurts them both. - 7 1/2 out of 10.
Wideo Wabbit- by McKimson, reflects Bugs going on Elmer Fudd's television show. This created the spin-off People Are Bunny in 1959. Bugs tricks Elmer into several shows and parodies of Liberace, Groucho Marx, and other shows at the time. For TV, I'd rather stick with the real thing. - 6 1/2 out of 10.
Hare-way to The Stars- by Chuck Jones, reflect an chase of instant Martians by Marvin the Martian, after Bugs accidentally goes in an rocket leaving Earth. Unfortunitely, Bugs takes the Martians on his way to the Earth. I wish I could have seen what happened after the Martians landed in the sewer. I think it would be an great sequel. - 8 3/4 out of 10.
Water, Water Every Hare- also by Chuck Jones, lands Bugs into trouble, when an flood sweeps him out of his home, and into an castle with Gossamer. At the end, Gossamer is so small, he is in a boat telling an pull to surprise. - 8 out of 10.
I found this cartoon collection very funny. I didn't think it was as good as some of the other cartoon anthologies Bugs Bunny has been in. However, it does serve up an few good laughs for kids just like me. An twenty year old man, with the joy of an 9 year old. I love cartoons.",998697600,9,1831,4.249283667621777
