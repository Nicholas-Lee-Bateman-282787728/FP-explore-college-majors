8355758,1,B0001AP0XQ,I picked up this movie used for a few bucks but it sucked so bad if I had a time machine I would go back and stop myself from buying it. It was the worst excuse for a horror movie I'm seen in a long time. I don't think it would even be scary to a little kid. The dead guy comes back as a ghost and cusses out his girlfriend and drinks beer and rattles on and on until you wish there was a way to kill a ghost.,1177113600,,409,3.5555555555555554
