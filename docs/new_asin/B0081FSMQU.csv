5116869,4,B0081FSMQU,"This is the long-awaited return of writer-director Whit Stillman, who we last saw with the delicious 1998's ""Last Days of Disco"" movie.

""Damsels in Distress"" (98 min.) brings the story set at a finctional Northeast university in which a group of young women, namely Violet( played by Greta Gerwig), Rose(played by Megalyn Echikunwoke) and Heather (played by Carrie MacLemore) take a transfer student Lily (played by Analeigh Tipton) under their wings. The group is determined to bring a better life to students, running the Suicide Center (which they rename the Suice Prevention Center). Of course that is not counting for the guy troubles that may, and will, occur. One of those is a fellow named Xavier. There is a hilarious scene in which Lily tries to explain that Xavier is spelled with an X, when one of the other girls say that it is surely it is spelled with a Z, as in ""Zorro"", at which point Violet surmises that the letters X and Z are pronouned the same when not ending in a word, ha! Gerwig's performance pretty much carries this movie, as she shows her vulnerability and you can't help but rooting for her all the way.

This light and quirky tone never leaves the movie, and I found myself quite smiling a lot (but not laughing out loud). Truth be told, the ""tone"" of the movie is better than the actual plot (which I won't give away here, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out). In all, this is a quirky little but loveable movie. This is MILES away from your Hollywood standard fare, and if you are into such type movie, I would readily recommend this. Nothing earth-shattering, just plain likeable.",1336262400,2,1636,4.637931034482759
5116870,5,B0081FSMQU,"Life, perhaps, is an allusion. Therefore, gentle reader, please move on to a different review if you don't smile in Pavlovian fashion when hearing uttered the name ""Whit Stillman.""

Recently I learned that Stillman's Last Days of Disco has yet to break even in sales. Alas, how long we NCAs (see below) have waited since they booked that clown! Damsels in Distress, gratefully, is scarcely stillborn-- rather, it's more Still. If you have worn laser holes into your Criterion-Collection copies of Metropolitan, Barcelona, and The Last Days of Disco, then Damsels will not disappoint. However, if you are unfamiliar with the signature dialogue, settings, motifs, and characters of this returned-to-America auteur, perhaps Damsels will disappoint. Here, I write for the initiates. (And for these, I whisper, ""Watch closely: the professor and one of the two off-campus waitresses are familiar friends from the trilogy!"")

What's to tell? There are four principle characters, all matriculated at Ivy-Shrouded Seven Oaks College after prepping in the usual way. While it is true that Greta Gerwig's Violet is the heroine, Carrie MacLemore as Heather, Megalyn Echikunwoke as Rose, and Analeigh Tipton as Lily make Damsels another ensemble piece.

I live in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, and while many who bedroom here commute to Manhattan, it is the home of Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel, which is sufficient explanation for why during both my first viewing of Metropolitan and of Damsels (in the selfsame indy-theatre complex), I annoyed many in the audience with my vulgar guffaws and howls of laughter while the rest of the moviegoers were silent.

Stillman, gratifyingly, is at the top of his game in Damsels. As with the trilogy, I will never grow tired of watching this film. I found Damsels as pitch-perfect as the trilogy, and while not so small-budgeted as Metropolitan, Damsels finds Stillman able to deadpan as much mirth as ever without the expenses of Disco. I do hope Mr. Stillman does not keep his Nearly Cultist Aficionados waiting so long before his next cinematic venture.

Neither my wife nor I were born with Stillman's or his characters' class prerogatives, and our Phi Beta Kappa keys from the familiar safety school of our locale--namely, Lehigh University--have done us absolutely no good for over thirty years, at least with respect to our wannabe aspirations, much like those of Luis Buuel. We have an old poster of Barcelona on the wall of my workspace, which is slightly more commodious than a railroad-apartment's standard room.

While unfit to play croquet with either Mr. Stillman or Jamie Johnson, I wish to thank Mr. S. for bringing delight to those with the ears and eyes to hear and see. We do associate with Episcopalians, but none of these sired debutante progeny waiting in the Hamptons for the season to begin.",1336176000,6,2851,5.094218415417559

One of the main female characters has no lines in the movie except to describe various men as ""playboy or operator types"" in a english accent.

5116889,2,B0081FSMQU,"First, I am a major Whit Stillman fan.  Last Days of Disco, Barcelona, and the wonderful Metropolitan are among my top favorite movies.  Smart, funny, literate, observant of a tribe -- the WASPs -- no one bothers with anymore.  But this movie is incomprehensible.  It's almost as if anyone who does a movie with Greta Gerwig becomes weirdly spellbound and ends up making her film about her horrible dancing (see of don't see Hannah Ah).  Stop already!  The movie starts out with an interesting premise -- attractive young girls at a mediocre Northeastern college who are mean-girl opposites.  They want to save students from committing suicide by teaching them to tap dance.  On the look out for depressed under grads they are well-meaning but intrusive.  It's promising beginning, however, disintegrates into a tangle of overly eccentric relationships that make no emotional sense at all and that pop up and disappear as if Stillman is making the movie up as he goes along.  It ends for no reason except to allow Greta to gamely dance with a throw-away young man through  a 30-like set with a Fred Astaire musical bit.

5116890,2,B0081FSMQU,"I was excited by the possibility of an enjoyable movie with an ensemble of talented young women. Unfortunately, viewing this movie only led to disappointment. The dialogue is too carefully calculated resulting in the delivery of awkwardly wordy monologues as the other actors stand and wait to retort. There are some major technical flaws with exposure and basic camera blocking that are distracting. The structure of the film is unpredictable because it makes no sense. This movie is not fun or challenging in a thoughtful way. It is just challenging to maintain any interest through to the end.

I thought I should watch Last Days of Disco to see if this film was an anomaly to the director's work. Unfortunately, Damsels in Distress is simply a lower budget, lesser quality film examining the same privileged, young, white person problems--too much money, time and education and no real ambition to do anything useful with any of it.",1393804800,2,936,5.0

5116892,5,B0081FSMQU,"******SPOILERS******

A solid pink screen comes up, reminiscent of the great Pink Scene from the Astaire/Hepburn film, Funny Face, and then a solid violet screen, then pink-on-violet credits all wrapped in a bubbly score promising a bubbly-light romantic-comedy. And it will deliver as it dances overonly side-glancing with witty asidesthe darker realms of existence resulting from not heeding Goethes best advice to not ever forget that only courtesy of the heart can hold a civilization together, and to ignore this always ends in barbarism. And during the 60s and early 70s, when liberation became the air that we breathe, the only instant act of freedom in defiance of the Judeo-Christian sexual ethic (the cornerstone of repression) was sexual license. And in this context Theodore Reich (founder of what would be a successful 20th century sexual revolution) insisted that the origin of all forms of repression are sexual in origin, and that the den of sexual repression is the nuclear family, and why it must be destroyedand look around. Although bathed in rights rhetoric, redefining marriage is the dismantling of the nuclear family (man, woman, child).  And I would argue that the three damsels (Violet, Rose, and Heather) are on a mission to save civilization by saving the family, that they are not counter-revolutionaries, but revolutionaries. They clearly see the new university model that breeds the new barbarism (theirs is the last university to go co-ed, a major assault on the dignity and mystery of man and woman; modesty dies fast at co-ed colleges, and modesty is the only key to intimacy for man and woman).

The new barbarians exult in the idealization of rights as license for total autonomy in what one says or does, especially a right to define oneself in any manner chosen and have it sanctioned in law and taught to children in schools, even if every known science can prove it a faulty construction. For example, a man cannot be a woman, and a woman cannot be a manyet this truth has already been declared anathema by the rulers of the new barbarism. The new barbarian operates under one principle, getting his needs met, and his life essentials are hedonistic delight in any form chosen, which is an idealization of greed (untethered desire!) for every moment of any given day, focusing on getting ones needs met, while Goethes courtesy of the heart is the first and most entrenched opposition to this ideal, the second being sop-hearted romanticism with its notion of everlasting intimacy, of man and woman melding into one. The new barbarians insist these theological notions were simply metaphysical and psychological tools utilized by religionists to prevent us from pursuing what we really want and need on our own terms absent the consideration of others, most especially children.

Because this film invites the viewer into so many different realms, why I think it is a masterpiece, I figured Id just send along some of my favorite moments that speak to the new barbarism, my particular focus when viewing the film, reminding me that Kubricks A Clockwork Orange opens with a solid red screen and then goes to a solid blue screen that will as narrative coalesce into ultra-violet. It is a raw portrait of the new barbarian pit against the old who dress up their cyclical violence in moral justifications, repressed as it were. This new barbarian seeks only to get his needs met without justification, a pure act of will, whereas Damsels in Distress is a portrait of a revolutionary seeking to undermine this new order and restore the only order of substance that Goethe claimed possible, the order inherent in our courtesy of heart. The protagonists from both films have passion, both long for the ultra-violets, but Alex experiences it in humiliating, plundering and finally murdering others, whereas Violet is passionate about what is in the others best interest. She, in other words, has taken on the task of restoring a moral (relational) universe in an age of moral relativism (radical subjectivity).

Violet, Rose and Heather stand alone in their quixotic quest for this restoration. Although others (Lily, Priss, et al) will for a time move into their sphere of influence, these guests immediately become a counter-revolutionary force in opposing a tradition of mutual respect that requires self-examination and correction and never forgetting that our lives have meaning in service to others for the greater good, which makes possible the achievement of ones highest potential and thus becoming more of who one actually is, with the universal Judaic-Christian-Islamic understanding that God created us good, and thus to be good is to be who you are, the only actual self-actualization available.

Violet declares, I love clichs and hackneyed expressions of every kind. You know why? Because they're largely true. The hundreds, perhaps thousandsthat our language has bequeathed us, are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledgeDuring these formative college years we should try to learn as many clichd and hackneyed thoughts as possible. Furthermore, I think we will. This is Violets response to the barbarians whose battle cry is Kill the past, create the future! She is clear that she is fighting to restore what in tradition we need if we are to move forward in a true progression; otherwise were left with the new barbarians progressivism that is in fact a radical regression into chaos that always paves the way for the newest brand of tyrant. And this barbarism is so thick in the air you can smell it.

Heathers very practical concern during all this: Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily? which begs the question: When, how and why did relationships between man and woman become trapped in a sadomasochistic matrix?

The opening scene is the Trio in missionary zeal approaching a new student to help her survive the barbarian onslaught that could sink her into despair and drive her to commit suicide, and Violet recognizes in the new student, Lily, a taut survival mechanism in place: So you were unhappy and are looking to recover here. We learn later that Lilys personality would have never let that observation stand if it wasn't true, but we also learn that Lily seeks to be sheltered in a dissociative life  with a very high threshold for pain, a radical conformity that shuts down certain nerve centers to protect her from reliving a trauma that afflicts her and what she won't talk about, but in dissociating in this way, she naively allows herself to be traumatized yet again by a new boyfriend (to secretly keep the original trauma close to find an answer to its evil mystery?) who, like the old barbarians, dresses his sadism up in virtue, a transcendent virtue related to religious life.

The Trio:

Violet, the visionary leader, the prophetic voice. She has found a cure for what ails us most, a cynicism that invited the new barbarism in. The cure, she insists, lies in creating a new dance craze. We know Lily, the person Violet sets out to save, will never understand Violet because Lily hasn't the ability to distinguish in terms of what has ontological depth and meaning and what doesnt; for example, for Lily an arrogant voice from a person desperately trying to save lives isn't any different from an arrogant voice seeking to ridicule, maim and otherwise harm all that come under his sphere of influence, what he is convinced is in their best interest.

Rose, after looking deep inside, finds she has no humility, and therefore is no longer a concern. But shes a pragmatic, utilitarian moralist, understanding that rules and regulations are the only means available to prevent the con men, the confidence tricksters, playboy operators and rat bitches from turning your life into a torture chamber. Rose who by default (no humility) is cynical still makes every effort to insure that her life will be reasonably enjoyed, and this requires an ethical framework to keep the new barbarians at bay, which Violet has provided. Rose also holds the post-modern conviction that identities are makeshift and of no ontological weight, and thus can be altered at will (but Violet in a look expresses doubt, as if something were missing in this deconstruction/construction, but Violet, too, creates her own identity), making the heart of identity what one wills which makes every identity of equal weight or no weight at all, ones true identity now lost in a sea of masks that lead us nowhere but keep us entertained and in controlsomewhat that is. Yet we do get a glimpse of Violets and Roses real identities in conversation and in childhood flashback scenes and clearly see the impact it has had on their identity-constructions, and this gives us a sense that Violet and Rose have unknowingly been collaborators since youth in this notion of reconstructing identity to build ones own personality, and as Rose insists, it must be built solely on the principle of excellence, the only place true freedom can reside, what is best suited to being the image of Godwho we really are, that image. But my sense is that they are not actually constructing identities, but rather choosing roles to not lose sight of who they really are, what has no value in the age of the new barbarism. In other words, they are warriors for the preservation of who they really are uniquely in the world, and they can change roles like a set of clothes to stay on course in traveling to who they are as persons, and these roles take on meaning to the degree that they are true to who one truly is, which, as identity, does have ontological weight and depth!

Heather completes the Trio as what I view is a person with a Deep South sensibility who embraces the modern world on its own terms, but refusing to give up the grace and manners of her tradition, Goethes courtesy of the heart that comes to life in recognizable charm and hospitality. Although mostly on the periphery when the three are framed, it is Heathers presence with her expressions that reveal a listening, an affirming and a questioning (she is mostly quietly her own person, but she can be very direct in her genteel way of making clear what the issue is). Her peripheral presence serves to knit closed the garment that gives final form to Violets vision. Heather is the one who convinces us Violets vision has universal appeal, for her interests are much like Roses, more concerned with good manners being honored as the rule in our social interactions as a means of optimizing the good life for oneself and others. But everything comes back to Violet. It is she that we follow with an abiding interest because she has a powerful and perhaps the only answer to wars endlessly ending wars in geopolitical affairs and in our personal lives: She would turn all of life into a dance. This is the secret she reveals to us: like Batman, we all know that it is what we do that defines us, and it is only when our lives are relational do they become truly activated, otherwise we would be zombies, and dance is the art form that involves movement with another in relation to the whole, precisely why Strauss was a radical artist: he brought the body, mind and spirit personally and communally back together in music for an upper-crust that had sought to separate the body from the higher things of cultural indulgence, creating a realm of high abstraction; Strauss singlehandedly restored this relational expression that affirms all that is good in human relatedness, and Astaire was the master artist to eventually appear in this realm, and of all the painters, Degas understood it best (his Ballet Master could have been titled God the Father); so, as often as we can, we must dance, even if only in a conversation where a dance is semi-on-simmer. I learned this as a child obsessing on Fred Astaire films. No doubt this is true of Stillman, revealed in his love of the disco days where you could dance your way inside and out of every tragedy, as we witness Frank and Violet doing in their dance together, where they both seem to be the most of who they really are, where they first connected.

When Stillman has an African American youth encounter the Trio and tell them his name is Jimbo, he pops a sealed can on institutional racism. I have no idea what the origin of the name is, but for us street kids in New York in the early 60s it had a pejorative connotation, of somehow being less than who one is. But I also sensed that the word must have at some point had a positive meaning, perhaps applied to a dancer with such style and grace that it transcended every boundary in revealing man to man, Astaire-style. But the point is the scene where Violet makes her case that there is something suspicious about the youth being nicknamed Jimbo by his friends, how it defied logic and that he should try to find out what his friends intentions really are, and possibly in the process identify a social/cultural infection, cleaning the wound and healing it in an effort to remain whole in ones good intentions.

Violet and friends decide to take up the fight that no one else will fight. They are on the side of the smallest minority, those who are convinced that life more abundantly is mysteriously actualized not in service to self, but to others. And they are up against hordes of those protesting that life more abundantly means simply what it says, that we want more and more of what we can get, and theres always more to get. Lily, who wants most to fit in wherever the culture finds itself, good or bad, is shocked most by Violet when she proclaims, The Lord said, Be fruitful and multiplythis is how the world works, seeing someone across a room. This could be the great romantic story you tell your grandchildren. In other words, a life of service to children and grandchildren, what the world more and more finds anathema in the new barbarism of getting ones needs met, and why even the thought of having children invokes terror, not a sense of being blessed. Getting rid of it quickly if it shows up could be the sequel, and the trilogy complete when we all as zombies finally get along without effort, what Lily so easily understands and desires.

Theres many ways to look at the ending. For me it was perfect, for we needed a glimpse of how Violets vision looks in her mind, what inspired such loyalty in Rose and Heather. It is reminiscent of that last scene in Terry Gilliams Brazil, where the only real escape is inside a vision that must remain in the deepest region of ones mind, or digitally stored someplace.",1392249600,,14566,4.818072770891644
5116893,4,B0081FSMQU,"This movie is a complete mess.  At times I thought the director was making it up as it went along.  There is no plot.  Nothing makes sense.  Presumably set in present times, but the Ivy League college, some of the fashions, the principles of some characters.....seem like throwbacks to the 50s or 60s.  Even the title doesn't seem to fit......these strong, crusading damsels are not in need of rescue.  Or are they?

I had to surrender to the movie's appeal, since Gertwig is so fantastic as Violet and moments made me laugh out loud.  It seems a female response to some of the gross-out male comedies.  The idiotic battle of the ""Romans"" and the barbarians perfectly portrays just how ridiculous men sometimes seem to women......and not just on campus.

And why not portray coming of age as a mess of missteps and colliding intentions?  Real life may not feature the redemptive value of soap and international dance crazes, but choices and values are a difficult path to navigate, and one can sympathize with an insistence on standards, however idiosyncratic.  These are young women haphazardly trying to hang on to dignity and self-respect.

The brilliant absurdity of Violet's dialogue and Gertwig's performance lift this screwball comedy above ""chick-flik.""  Don't expect too much of a plot, and you'll find a lot to enjoy about this movie.",1389744000,,1344,4.941964285714286

5116896,4,B0081FSMQU,"""Damsels In Distress"" appears to be a contemporary film about modern college life on the surface but underneath lurks a throwback screwball comedy to an era when films like this starred Cary Grant and were directed by Howard Hawks. The plot of this thinly-disguised reverb revolves around four college women running a suicide prevention center and using dancing as therapy for those so lovelorn or torn by conflict they may want to end it all. To satisfay modern sensibilities, it spends some time in their socialization with men. However, the dancing subplot (wait until you see the end!) should give anyone under age 50 a clue this film isn't about modern times but a refelction of the not-so-near past.

If that's not enough, the film eschews all the trappings of modern college films. There are no sex scenes, no topless women, no bimbos, few idiotic young men living out of a beer bottle, almost no predictable scenes, and just about none of the cliches that usually surround college age film in the new century (or the latter part of last century.) This film is instead a sober, almost understated, comedy about being young and growing up, turns in life, mild conflicts, subtle humor, sensitivity and making lemonade when handed lemons.

It was very pleasing to see such a fine film among the trash that usually passes for filmmaking today. Not a single time did I have to witness a cheerleader, jock, BMOC or other cliches in a college film. In contrast, there was often intelligent humor and conversation substituted for profanity and other R-rated tactics meant to draw in the younger audience seeking titilation. Without the apparent trappings, it's a curiosity to whom the film is intended. My guess is it is people seeking highly creative entertainment with elements of both fantasy and real-life.

5116902,5,B0081FSMQU,"First, the short version: _Damsels in Distress_ is a delightful romp across the fictional landscape of the campus of Seven Oaks. The wit is unabating, never slapstick, always a series of low-key delights that results in a feel-good flick that will have you trading phrases with others for weeks. Now, for those who want more detail: I'm usually a critical viewer of film. I don't ""love"" everything--far from it--but what I do prize is a idiosyncratic film that excites everything from uncontrollable laughter to sprinked giggles. I also admire the indie films that do not fall into the abyss of esoterica or feel they need to eschew certain qualities (like entertaining dialogue and flow) or find something gimmicky to recommend themselves.

_Damsels in Distress_ revolves around the misadventures of four female college students in their attempt to improve the quality of life--primarily the olfactory experience-- of life at their college. Their ringleader is pitch-perfect, deadpan and carries idealism about helping the less fortunate (read: frat boys) to hilarious extremes. Her measured tone complements her neuroses in a delightful way. The second is a wordly girl, always looking at men with suspicion. The third musketeer is a giggly  counterpoint to the serious sincerity of her companions. The D'Artagnan of this group is Lily, a transfer student grateful for the attention of our three Musketerresses but normal enough to regard their activities with wide-eyed perplexity and down-to-earth commentary. Whether it is the hapless frat boys--idiotic to the point of being challenged in the world--, the transformative powers of scent or humanitarian efforts, these damsels not only navigate but define the space in which they operate. It's not a bringer of higher meaning, but it is pure fun--and I haven't even described the set of ridiculous players that augment this cast!

5116903,5,B0081FSMQU,"Whit Stillman has quite the following and quite the distinct directorial style.  I still remember quite fondly my first dance with the director; 1990s Metropolitan.  I was in love with his unique spin on Woody Allen-esque dialog.  I remember likening him to the love child of Allen and Robert Altman.  Whit, charm and a quirky sense of realism abound in his work.

Damsels in Distress is no different.

The film takes place in a fictional university where a group of young women run a center for suicidal teens where they attempt to help the depressed through dance.  The leader of the group is Violet, and the whole film kind of hinges on Gerwigs development of this character.

As the somewhat abrasive and manipulatively judgmental ringleader of her clique, Violet is an easy girl to hate.  Gerwig colors her with such personality that one cant help but LOVE to hate her.  Violet talks bad about everyone, has a serious opinion about everything and masks her personal insecurities with a seemingly faux desire to help others.  The thing is, Violet really isn't all that evil, she just appears that way.  Her saccharine sweetness that is offset by her abrasive bark is genuine to the core, she just has a really hard time communicating it properly.  What is so remarkable about Gerwigs performance is that she actually nails a deeper soul instead of merely presenting us with a skeletal observation of a loon.  Violet is so bizarre and almost idiotic in her reasoning and so one could have easily played her for cheap laughs, creating mere comic relief.  Instead, Gerwig took the opportunity to embellish Violet, giving her real depth.  You can feel her inner pain, even if it at times stems from a ridiculous place.  She never feels as fake as she appears; which is another feat in itself.  Gerwig beautifully balances out the outward appearance of Violet with the inner emotional growth.

At the end of the day, she isn't the villain we all thought she was and were pining for her happiness.

I just loved every minute of this offbeat comedy.  The jokes are delivered in that desired deadpan that helps each one make a lasting impression.  Whit hasn't lost his wit one bit, and each moment of this film drips with charm and excitement.",1361491200,,2239,4.761038961038961
5116904,4,B0081FSMQU,"There may be spoilers.
Director Whit Stillman hasn't made a movie in more than a decade, so I was looking forward to this, his fourth film.  There are few writers who can assemble such thoughtful, provocative and articulate words together and at the same time, make us laugh.  ""Damsels"" isn't one of those laugh-out-loud movies but one where you snicker, smirk, chuckle and maintain a smile on your face throughout the 99 minute playing time.  With a fine cast led by atypical beauty Greta Gerwig as Violet, the film takes a while to find its footing.

Violet is a college do-gooder with suicide prevention her primary focus.  She softly commands 3 others who join her effort.  Violet is one of those individuals who somehow manage to tell the truth, or her version of it, no matter how it might affect someone.  She does take considerable effort to minimize the hurt by use of her flourishing vocabulary.  Violet and the girls aren't mean or vicious.  They actually want to help the frat boys in spite of their bad smell, low intelligence and brutishness.  In one scene, Violet breaks up with a short-term boyfriend from France after catching him with another girl.  He had a strange religion which involves an ""unusual"" position for sex and as she tells him, ""I couldn't respect any religion that worships on Tuesday.""

After a short stent alone in a cheap motel, Violet discovers the wonderful scent of the complementary soap the motel provides.  After testing the smell on her friends, she decides this could be transformative and supplies samples inside a package that the fraternity boys think makes for a great Frisbee.  Violet has also been working on a new dance ""sensation"" that will ease depression, isolation and even suicide.  The movie ends with the role out of the Sambola.  This is a fun, unusual and easy to watch film.

The Blu ray edition comes in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio presented in 1080p.  Watching this on a large display the transfer seems a bit washed out.  It is not unusually crisp and sharp.  I suspect this was intentional as the director wanted a smooth yet detail picture.  It certainly didn't bother me.  The audio is excellent with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 delivering the mostly centered action.  There is nothing that stands out as this is mostly a dialog heavy film.  For whatever reason, the volume is lower than usual.  I had to crank my receiver's volume up quite a bit.",1356912000,2,2409,4.746987951807229

5116906,2,B0081FSMQU,"Allow me a quick indulgence here before the actual review.  I've noticed here on Amazon that a lot of thought out and what I would consider helpful reviews are marked as ""unhelpful"" by the nameless button clickers who disagree with the review, and that is already fully in force here with the reviews of ""Damsels In Distress.""  That button isn't there for you to use if you disagree with the review, it's there if the review isn't helpful to other people.  BIG difference.  So here, I'm going to simply ask you to leave a thoughtful comment on WHY you don't think this review is helpful if you find that you just have to hit the ""unhelpful"" button.  Thank you!

I'll admit, coming into this movie I wasn't really familiar with Whit Stillman's work.  It seems that those that love this movie are already fans and happy to get another glimpse at a film with his style attached to it.  Unfortunately for me, I just didn't find a whole lot of likeable things about this movie.  The characters are fairly wooden and emotionless, the dialog is laughably bad in such a way that you just know that it had to be written to make you think exactly that it was written that way on purpose.

The movie is based on college age characters and the women are portrayed as near psychopaths with most living their lives pretending to be something they are not and for some reason obsessed with smell and particularly the smell of a particular type of soap.  This magical soap it seems, to them anyway, to have the power to change the world, or at least the particularly smelly guys at one fraternity house.  Men, overall, are played as complete idiots here.  I'm fine with that and I will attest there are plenty of idiotic guys in the world, but a college age guy that doesn't know which colors are which because he skipped kindergarten?

Maybe I missed something here, so again if you disagree with my assessment why don't you add something to the review here in the comments instead of just hitting the ""unhelpful"" button and tell my why I should have cared about the characters in this movie.  I simply don't believe the characters were fleshed out enough to make me care, and with the rest of the style of this film I'm contemplating the fact that maybe that was also on purpose.  Of course, then I have to contemplate exactly why someone would create characters intentionally that an audience wouldn't connect with on any level.  Go ahead, leave a comment, maybe you'll convince me what I missed.  If you don't leave a comment and you just hit ""unhelpful"" well then you're no better than the characters here in the movie, without substance.

Overall it's hard for me to recommend this movie unless you're a fan of Whit Stillman in which case you might be a whole lot more apt to like this movie.  If you're not, I don't think you'll hate yourself for sitting through the movie or anything.  I doubt you'll want to run to a two story building and jump off in an apparent attempt to maim yourself or anything.  You'll probably just sit and ponder silently at the end just what the heck the point of what you just watched was.",1354492800,3,3110,4.516071428571428
5116907,4,B0081FSMQU,"Whit Stillman, the director who brought us ""Metropolitan"", ""The Last Days of Disco"" and ""Barcelona"".

Known for his acerbic intellectual wit from the youth of high society and their views of the world, Stillman has experienced a lot from attending Harvard and his grandfather E. Digby Baltzell was responsible for coining the term WASP (White Anglo Saxon Protestant).  Having captivated viewers thanks to his film's use of intellectual dialogue, a style reminiscent of French New Wave filmmakers such as Eric Rohmer and Francois Truffaut, perhaps the most surprising factor in Stillman's career is that he stopped making films after ""Barcelona"" in 1994.

The director moved to Paris and began a new life for himself as a writer-for-hire.  It's not that he stopped writing, in fact he had worked on adaptations of memoir's according to an interview in ""Town and Country"" (April 2012) for Mao's China ""The Red Azalea"", Christopher Buckley's ""Little Green Men"" and even wrote a movie that is set in 1960s Jamaica.

As for fans, many continued to share their love for his films all these years.  To this day, fans of his film continue to share quotes on Facebook pages such as ""Urban Haute Bourgeoisie"" (a term used in his first film ""Metropolitan"") and many have hoped for a sequel.  Well, at least a return to the American preppie.

And so Stillman returned.  Writing ""Damsels in Distress"" created with private money, created with a low budget and once again, a film that continues his use of intellectual dialogue and received favorably by film critics nationwide.

VIDEO:

""Damsels in Distress"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Although this film was shot with private funds and for the most part, low budget.  Whatever you do, don't think about the quality of how Stillman's ""Metropolitan"" was.  ""Damsels in Distress"" is a vibrant film featuring natural skin tones, very good detail during closeup shots, black levels are nice and deep.  For the most part, ""Damsels in Distress"" looks amazing on Blu-ray and I saw no problems with the video during my viewing.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Damsels in Distress"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and is primarily heard through the center and front channels.  That is until you get to scenes with music, which also sounds as crystal clear as the dialogue.  The film does incorporate a more musical feel towards the latter part of the film but I heard no problems whatsoever during my viewing of this film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Damsels in Distress"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Whit Stillman, Greta Gerwig, Adam Brody, Megalyn Echikunwoke, Analeigh Tipton and Carrie Maclemore.
  Damsels in Distress: Behind the Scenes - (10:10) Extended featurette featuring the cast talking about working with Whit Stillman, other cast members and their characters
  Deleted Scenes  - (7:08) - Featuring six deleted scenes.
  Outtakes - (5:59) Featuring outtakes from ""Damsels in Distress"".
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:23) The original theatrical trailer for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I love Whit Stillman films and from me, sharing quotes from his films on Facebook's ""Urban Haute Borgeousie"" group page, what many of us have in common is our thirst for intellectual comedy.

And I know that his films are not for everyone.  For the most part, ""Damsels in Distress"", similar to ""Metropolitan"" tend to focus on people who appear or are privileged, come from a well-to-do family and for the most part, ""preppy"".  But its that humor of the outsider being taken into a group and seeing how they do if put into that situation.

In ""Metropolitan"", we were introduced to an intellectual named Tom, who comes from a family with not much money, but yet, is somehow pulled into the circle of the have's and because of the intellectual conversations, despite how he may see some people as pedantic, they are are a far cry from troglodytes.

For ""Damsels in Distress"", it's much more milder, set at a college with one character who does most of the talking, but its what comes out of her mouth that surprises us.  ""Damsels in Distress"" continues that Whit Stillman style of wit, in an acerbic intellectual tone but yet makes the character and their moments in the film so fun and delightful to watch.

For example, here is a conversation between Violet and Heather discussing what they want the group to accomplish with the guys on campus:

Violet: Our aspirations are pretty basic - take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential - or doesn't even have much...

Heather: Someone like Frank!

Violet: Yes. Then help them realize it or find more. There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.

And for those who have missed the more intellectual conversations that were amusing and fun, here is a quote between the characters of Lily and Charlie:

Lily: ""There no logic to the algebra of love.""

Charlie: ""The algebra of love? Sounds like the title of some lame book.""

Lily: ""It's a title but the book's not lame at all.""

Charlie: ""Love's algebra? I always thought it was more geometry.""

Lily: ""Okay, the title's not good but the book is.""

Charlie: ""What's it say?""

Lily: ""Well, that while we're all perverse in our preferences, there's actually this logic, or algebra to our perversity. And it has something to do with how the species has evolved.""

Charlie: ""The survival of the species?""

Lily: ""Yes, and whether it will continue to do so.""

And with these intellectual conversations, I have always wrote in my reviews of Stillman films of how these conversations remind me of French New Wave and sure enough, a scene where Xavier talks to Lily about Jean Renoir and Francois Truffaut.

Often, when I meet other social intellectuals, from time-to-time, the Whit Stillman discussions do happen.  What is it about his films that captivate us.  Is it because these characters seem as if they are on another planet or is it because inside, there are some people who want to be part of the Whit Stillman world.

For ""Damsels in Distress"", Violet is similar to Tom of ""Metropolitan"".  Both can carry on intellectual discussions, they seem as if they come from wonderful, educated families but in truth, they're not.  Violet is a person who was teased and didn't have that great of a childhood, but when you get out of high school, you have the choice to choose a new life for yourself.  Something different than what you were before.

And her decision was to be a proper woman, even if it means building herself and making her feel as if she's part of the intellectual elite at ""Seven Oaks"".  She's so good at it, you don't know if she's lying or she has the facts to back it up.  In one scene, where she is defending in class the importance of dance, she comes up with names of people who created the Waltz, the Charleston and the Twist.  She sounds so convincing that everyone believes that she is correct.

As for Rose and Heather, we learn how Rose is more of the person who adds stability to Violet.  Similar to Violet, she has also created her own persona, making people think she is British because of her English accent.  But I wish this was probed a bit more.  Was Rose a character that wanted to distinguish herself from African-American women, that having a accent distinguishes her?

As for Heather, I would describe her character as the inquisitive follower, while Lily is the person who is there to challenge Violet of why she thinks a certain way.  And it's quite interesting to see these two women communicate with each other because in one sense, you wonder if they really dislike each other or just tolerant individuals.

I really enjoyed ""Damsels in Distress"" but I wish the male characters were consistent with their female counterpart.  I know it's seems like a broken record to keep bringing up ""Metropolitan"" but what I loved about that film is that men and women were on the same playing field.  Both sides were intellectual and were able to share deep conversations.

With ""Damsels in Distress"", the men are dumb, liars or cheats.  For the man paired with Violet, the character of Frank was a mismatch. Not only did he appear as the stereotypical dumb jock, you just don't see how Violet could be with this man.  For Heather, being with Thor, another man who is not so smart.

Fortunately, you have Adam Brody playing the role of Charlie Walker, but in reality he's Fred Packenstacker, a guy who lies and makes him seem important in order to meet women.  But fortunately, he is able to engage in intellectual conversation with both Violet and Lily and quite interesting is his interest in Violet's dance day.  There's chemistry there that works! As opposed to Frank who talks about women, hacky sack and the only thing that seems to come out of his mouth is ""dumb bitch!"".

But this is college afterall.  And I'm sure many of us can say we have met people like Frank.

I do want to bring in something that was quite interesting is the discussion between Lily and Xavier on Cathars.  Cathars were adherents of an ascetic Christian movement in Europe.  And in the discussion, he preferred sex via sodomy than from the front because of his religious beliefs.  And this led me to researching about Cathars and I found it interesting of how Stillman introduced it into the film and made me wonder why.

With Stillman's appreciation for French New Wave, it felt as if Stillman wanted to lead to a deep conversation about religion.  The scene takes place not long after Lily and Xavier are talking about the French New Wave, but while watching this, immediately popping into my mind was Eric Rohmer's ""My Night at Maud's"". What I loved about the film is how Jean-Louis and Maud engaged in a discussion of Pascal's notion of ""Pascal's Wager"".  In the film, Maud becomes intrigued by Jean-Louis and his religious moral code.

After Lily and Xavier discuss the Cathar's and the discussion of sex does come up, you know the discussion of sex only from behind is not a topic that will fascinate Lily, in fact, she seems more frightened by it.  But for ""My Night at Maud's"", the discussion was important in order to bring closeness between the Catholic Jean-Louis and the free-spirited Maud.  The discussion seemed to work in reverse for Xavier and Lily, I was just fascinated by how Stillman would include it on the film.  Fortunately, the Blu-ray release does include audio commentary!

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Damsels in Distress"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray and its lossless audio is complimentary to the film (I wasn't expecting surround sound but mostly ambiance).  There are also a good number of special features included as well, especially an intriguing audio commentary involving Stillman and the main cast.

Overall, ""Damsels in Distress"" is a good welcome back for Whit Stillman.  I have wanted to see this director return because his films are so different but yet delightful.  His films make me rewind, savor each quote and share it with my friends because it makes me laugh.  While ""Damsels in Distress"" is a good film, it has its shortcomings.  But I suppose compared to other college films, instead of binge drinking and everyone trying to get laid, in retrospect, I'm quite grateful that Stillman avoided such banality.

And aside from the intellectual dialogue which I enjoyed, an out of nowhere musical scene also appears in the film, which I enjoyed as well.

""Damsels in Distress"" may not be better than ""Metropolitan"", but I do feel that with Stillman's return, things can only get better from here and I look forward to more of his films to come!

Cleverly written, delightful and full of humor, ""Damsels in Distress"" is worth recommending on Blu-ray!",1354320000,2,11858,4.8409542743538765
5116908,5,B0081FSMQU,"I really was not expecting too much from Whit Stillman in this fourth movie.  It's been a long time since the last one, and in some ways, those movies seem to belong to a different time.  So, I was startled when I liked this so much.  Actually, I loved it, watched it twice in one day and kept going back to parts of it even after that.  This is a great movie.  Quirky, beautifully filmed and acted, and very funny.

That having been said,  this type of movie is not everyone's cup of tea.  If you liked Metropolitan or Barcelona or Last Days of Disco, though, I'm betting you'll like this one, too.

The movie takes place on  a placid college campus somewhere in the Northeast.  It introduces us to the lives of four decidedly complicated women/ roommates who want to meet boys through their altruistic project.

I found the film to be alternately hilarious, really hilarious, and moving.

If you're not familiar with Stillman's other movies, they're similar to Woody Allen or the Before Sunrise/Sunset movies of Richard Linklater.  I've got to say, though,  Stillman's vision of life is much richer and more nuanced than either of those Directors.

Despite appearances, though, this isn't really of  the ""college comedy"" genre, and if that's what you're expecting, you'll  be disappointed.  To me - who thought I was in on the joke, than began to wonder if I was the butt of the joke, then thought I was on the inside again - but with this guy who knows - it was two hours of terrific entertainment.  Easily worth the cost of the rental.",1353888000,4,1539,4.5677655677655675

5116910,4,B0081FSMQU,"Well, it has been a long wait.  I had just come back from a year studying abroad in Europe and I stumbled into the theater to see a film that I did not know anything about, that film was Barcelona.  I was immediately hooked on Whit Stillman and have since seen the film innumerable times.  All of my friends seemed already to have heard of him and were so disappointed that his new film was not as good as Metropolitan.  I made sure to see it and to this day I prefer Barcelona.  Perhaps because it was my first Stillman film, perhaps because the riffing on fashionable anti-americanism really hit home after a year abroad amongst fashionably anti-american Europeans.  I waited and waited for his next film to come out and finally Last Days of Disco came out and I remember being very annoyed that Chris Eigeman didn't play a more prominent role in the film and that the film was a disappointment to me.  So, I was shocked and disappointed a few years later when a new friend insisted that Last Days of Disco was her favorite film and that Barcelona was her least favorite.  Different strokes for different folks, I thought at the time.  In the run up to the release of this film I went back and watched all of Stillman's films again and lo and behold, I changed my order of favorite films.  Barcelona is still on top for me but Last Days of Disco moved up over Metropolitan.  So I am hesitant to immediately throw Damsels into the bottom spot and harp on my disappointment in the film.  It is quirky and verbal and I had fun watching the picture.  That said, it didn't move me as much as the other pictures.  It worries me that Stillman keeps talking about wanting to make a film about dancers in Jamaica because I think the dancing part of this film is the weakest.  I'll let this percolate for a while and maybe watch it again.  i bought the BluRay and I haven't gone through the directors commentary or the other extras yet.  I will watch every film that Stillman makes, even if he makes his Jamaica film.  I would really like him to make something staring Eigeman again, preferably as the main character.  He is one of my favorite actors and having to watch him in Gilmore girls is like having to watch Mozart work as an organ grinder for a monkey.
My advice is to take one of two approaches.  Commit to watching all of his films and take them in the order that they came out.  If you like comedies of manners and verbal, witty banter movies, your time will be well rewarded, whether you come away as a major fan or not.  If you are just curious about what all the hubbub is all about, start with Barcelona, it is the most approachable film and the most like other movies out there.  Don't start with this one.  It is quirky and enjoyable but it won't blow you away and if that made you not want to watch the rest of Stillman's movies, that would be a loss.

If you enjoy work by Wes Anderson or Josh Whedon, you will enjoy this film.  Both writer/directors provide us with characters and situations hatched from their own clever, twisted view of the world, with voices that are instantly distinguishable from the cacophony of dull, dumb or gimmicky filmmaking.

If you like the more realistic worlds uniquely created in the films of Merchant, Ivory & Jhabvala, you will probably enjoy Stilman's films, despite the fact that their respective worlds are quite different.

5116914,4,B0081FSMQU,"Damsels is a low-budget, dialogue-driven comedy from Whit Stillman, the director of Metropolitan and The Last Days of Disco.  The humor comes mostly from the droll dialogue.  There isn't much of a plot - the movie is made up of vignettes in which the characters exchange quirky and deadpan dialogue - and dance.  Much of this is very funny if you're on board with this type of humor, but it could be excruciating for someone expecting a more conventional movie.  Stillman is not Woody Allen, but there's a good chance that if you like Allen's movies, you'll enjoy this.  My only complaint is that unlike Stillman's first feature, Metropolitan, it all feels rather superficial and you don't get a sense that these characters are real people.  This movie seems to take place in an altogether different reality.  A note about the Blu-ray:  Due to the way this movie was photographed on digital, the picture looks soft for a Blu-ray.

It is critical, smart, interesting, and funny.  Some of the dialogue is absolutely hilarious. Whit Stillman is the only filmmaker I know of that writes pretty realistic yet comic films about the elite.  It is fascinating to me to see how these people think.  This film, even more than his others, shows how sad and pathetic the people that run the world really are.  Sure they are oppressing just about everyone on earth and their actions cause untold devastation and suffering yet they believe they are doing the right thing ""God's Work"".  This is a scathing yet sympathetic critique of the American aristocracy. One would think this would be impossible but here it is.  He really has matured as a filmmaker.  This is his most complex and nuanced work yet.  Also, as with most cutting edge art, this film will likely require repeated exposure for one to learn to really appreciate its brilliance. I look forward to many further viewings.",1350086400,12,1078,4.7272727272727275
5116917,5,B0081FSMQU,"Last year, I had the fortune to stumble into this movie called ""Damsels In Distress"" made by a director I'd never heard of.  99 minutes later, I walked out of the theater with a huge smile on my face.  For the first time in years, I'd found a filmmaker that really seemed to be making something relatively original that I connected with.  Have been waiting for this title to show up on Blu-ray for months, and after popping in the disc, I couldn't be happier with the solid special features, great picture quality, and quirky but hilarious story.  After seeing Damsels, I went back to watch some of his earlier projects, and I have to say that this is not my favorite Stillman film (see Barcelona), but looking back on all the movies I caught in 2011, this ranks very near the top.",1349740800,2,781,4.440559440559441

Watch this movie with your friends and reminisce about college.",1348531200,4,419,4.6
5116924,2,B0081FSMQU,"Whit Stillman's first film since ""The Last Days of Disco"" was released some 14 years ago, ""Damels in Distress"" is an unfortunate disappointment: a self-conscious, often annoying ""comedy of manners"" involving a peculiar college student (Greta Gerwig) and her friends who take a transfer student (Analeigh Tipton) new to their campus and initiate her in the ways of social mores that disappeared from the world decades ago. Eventually, Tipton finds herself interested in two suitors - Adam Brody's polished pretty boy and Hugo Becker's foreign grad student - while Gerwig tries to reconcile her high standards with her feelings for boys beneath her social circumstance...or something.

I've been a big fan of Stillman's previous work: his debut hit ""Metropolitan"" remains a charming, sophisticated study of aristocratic modern young New Yorkers, and ""The Last Days of Disco,"" which I viewed again this July for the first time in many years, has also held up as an perceptive character study with offbeat humor. Perhaps Stillman was away from making movies for so long that he lost his fastball, because ""Damsels in Distress"" is a mess, starting off on the wrong foot and never recovering. Every character here is annoying and stilted, and what's more, the dialogue is leaden, showing none of the snap of the director's earlier pictures. The pacing, the development of the story, even the glossy digital cinematography - all of it comes off as awkward, and the musical sequences that conclude the film are almost embarrassing to behold. Gerwig would seem to be an ideal successor to the likes of Stillman's past heroines Chloe Sevigny and Caroline Farina (who appears in one sequence here), but saddled with uneven material that's seldom funny or involving, the actress can do little to overcome a film that's not just a letdown - it's almost depressing to watch at times.

Sony's Blu-Ray of ""Damsels in Distress"" is out next week, sporting commentary with Stillman and cast members, two featurettes, deleted scenes and outtakes. The almost distractingly soft cinematography is rendered as best as it can be in 1080p, while DTS MA sound includes a pleasant score from Stillman's past collaborators Mark Suozzo and Adam Schlesinger.",1347408000,9,2228,5.151933701657459
5116925,4,B0081FSMQU,"This is the long-awaited return of writer-director Whit Stillman, who we last saw with the delicious 1998's ""Last Days of Disco"" movie.

""Damsels in Distress"" (98 min.) brings the story set at a fictional Northeast university in which a group of young women, namely Violet (played by Greta Gerwig), Rose (played by Megalyn Echikunwoke) and Heather (played by Carrie MacLemore) take a transfer student Lily (played by Analeigh Tipton) under their wings. The group is determined to bring a better life to students, running the Suicide Center (which they rename the Suice Prevention Center). Of course that is not counting for the guy troubles that may, and will, occur. One of those is a fellow named Xavier. There is a hilarious scene in which Lily tries to explain that Xavier is spelled with an X, when one of the other girls say that it is surely it is spelled with a Z, as in ""Zorro"", at which point Violet surmises that the letters X and Z are pronouned the same when not ending in a word, ha! Gerwig's performance pretty much carries this movie, as she shows her vulnerability and you can't help but rooting for her all the way.

This light and quirky tone never leaves the movie, and I found myself quite smiling a lot (but not laughing out loud). Truth be told, the ""tone"" of the movie is better than the actual plot (which I won't give away here, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out). In all, this is a quirky little but loveable movie. This is MILES away from your Hollywood standard fare, and if you are into such type movie, I would readily recommend this. Nothing earth-shattering, just plain likeable. In that sense, ""Damsels in Distress"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1341100800,19,1696,4.65
5116926,4,B0081FSMQU,"Three young women at a college greet a new girl and welcome her into their clique. They are a unique collection of attractive young ladies who volunteer at a suicide prevention center and think they have their hands on the pulse of the student body. Their unusual verbalized ruminations are often quite humorous, and they are very likeable. They deal with some typical issues that college students face (relationships), but the film does not veer into the territory of your standard college boy-girl drama. This is an unusual and entertaining film featuring talented young actresses and is a movie that most audiences will enjoy.",1340841600,4,629,5.0576923076923075

When a blog I follow about Whit Stillman, whitstillman org,announced Damsels In Distress would be available on Amazon 7/31/12, I preordered immediately.
