8709603,3,B00V8IO35Q,"If youve read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bolshoi-Confidential/dp/0871402963/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bolshoi Confidential</a>, this film is a fine supplement. Youll get a look at the scandal and media frenzy surrounding the acid attack on Sergei Filin, as well as a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the company during the season following the attack.

Anybody who has ever watched a documentary about the inner workings of a ballet company won't find anything new here. Theres footage of rehearsals, of dancers away from the theatre, fragments of performances, views of what goes on in the wings, and arguments between and among management and talent. Still, any ballet fan will probably enjoy the chance to be a voyeur and get a feel for the atmosphere surrounding the Bolshoiplus the cinematography is lush and appealing.

There are a couple of flaws, though, that prevent Bolshoi Babylon from being an outstanding work. First, the filmmakers perpetuate the Ballet-Equals-Swan-Lake trope that seems to show up in every ballet movie meant to appeal to general audiences. Even though the movie covers an entire season, we're left with the impression that Swan Lake takes up 99% of the company's time onstage and offstage. Second, very little screen time is devoted to talking to (as opposed to looking at) dancers. Filin is presented as a very divisive influence on the entire Bolshoi Ballet, so it would have been interesting to hear more of what people at all levels of the performance hierarchy thought and felt about him.

Three stars as a standalone film, four stars if youve read and enjoyed Bolshoi Confidential.",1499904000,3,1665,5.52156862745098

This was more about the Bolshoi's history & performances, than the crime.
There were bits & pieces, here & there, about the Babylon culture, but not enough for this Entire Film, so they added FILLER & FLUFF.",1476835200,,234,5.0256410256410255
8709607,2,B00V8IO35Q,"The video was almost 90 minutes long.  Ostensibly, ""Bolshoi Babylon"" is, ""A behind-the-scenes look at Moscow's prestigious Bolshoi Theatre as it's rocked by an acid-attack scandal in 2013.""  But, it feels like someone was already working on a documentary about some of the lead dancers at the Bolshoi when the acid attack happened; providing the producers with one too many topics to focus on.

At the beginning, at least five minutes of the film was devoted to a ""ballet devotee"" who proclaimed the Bolshoi was a temple.  He said he'd attended almost all performances at the Bolshoi over the last 32 years.  Best guess is that he's the one who funded the film in the first place.

I ""signed up"" for learning about what was going on behind the scenes at the Bolshoi during the aftermath.  I wasn't expecting to watch the day to day struggles of some lead dancers.

I didn't enjoy it because it wasn't what I expected.  Maybe someone needs to write a better synopsis of the film.",1475366400,,978,4.6725146198830405
