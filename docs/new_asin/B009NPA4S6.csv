5357019,5,B009NPA4S6,"Rascal Flatts has always been one of my favorites.  When I saw the one day only movie showing of this in the theater, I loved every second of it.  People who weren't fans before it, or just knew the music, loved the band as much as the die hard fans do after this movie.  There are amazing performances, and music that touches your soul.  Amazing movie, amazing band.",1353456000,2,367,4.352941176470588

5357079,3,B009NPA4S6,"First of all, I love Rascal Flatts as much as anyone else, but I also saw the movie in the theater. This DVD does not contain the entire movie, which is what I wanted. Instead, I guess the band made room for their last five videos along with a behind-the-scenes for each of those videos. I would have rather had the entire movie, which had more live performances. I can go to YouTube and watch their videos. If they would release the entire movie (maybe on Blu-Ray), I'd still buy it. Don't get me wrong. This DVD is enjoyable and worth getting, but it should have been the complete movie and not part of the movie with videos as additional features.",1353801600,3,650,4.380165289256198

8543191,5,B009NPA4S6,I give the video fives stars because I appreciate how open they are in the interviews.  I love that they do some of the music acoustically.
