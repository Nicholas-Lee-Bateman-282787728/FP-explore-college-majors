6936289,4,B00RWCJXFC,"Many genre directors fail to be consistant throughout their careers, with a pioneering, creative peak (usually early on) followed by repetion that eventually becomes derivitive and bland.  Bruno Mattei remained consistantly bad from beginning to end, and IOTLD and ""Zombies:The Beginning"" are stark proof of such a rare directorial curve.
As a fan of his earlier horror films, such as ""The Other Hell"", ""Rats : Night Of Terror"" , and ""Hell Of The Living Dead"", I was delighted to see that an older Bruno was still capable of helming delightful B-movie trash cinema such as ""Island Of The Living Dead"".  Those of us who love watching this type of thing will go in with moderate expectations and emerge satisfied with the rediculous, gorey, insane presentation.
American independant horror has come a lone way, but holds nothing on what the Italians can create from near nothing.
My only gripe is the SOV look of the picture and it's excessive use of slow-motion.  Gives ""Island Of The Living Dead"" a 1990's porno feel instead of that authentic grindhouse experience.  My guess is using actual film is not as cost-effective when shooting an indie film.  What do I know?

Bad (funny) dubbing, cheaply shot, and chocked full of blood, guts, crazy dialogue, and fun.  Interesting to see one of the stars of Zombie 4: After Death in IOTLD.  For those who prefer the ongoing onslaught of Danny Trejo bad zombies will want to skip this one, because this movie is trash cinema at its best.

6936291,4,B00RWCJXFC,"This is late director Bruno Mattei's (using his frequent pseudonym ""Vincent Dawn"") penultimate film, a tale of zombies and vampires on an uncharted island. The frustrated treasure-hunting crew of the salvage ship The Dark Star (a tribute to John Carpenter?) encounter a strange fog bank one stormy night and wake up the following morning next to an island that is not on any map, an island where, centuries before, a zombie uprising and an attack by a vampire pirate crew killed an entire village of Spanish missionaries and a battalion of Conquistadors. With The Dark Star in need of repair, the crew takes a trip to the island to see if they can find any treasure to plunder. They do indeed find treasure, but more importantly, they discover that the island is crawling with zombies. When The Dark Star explodes (thanks to a gas leak during a zombie invasion) and the lifeboat ends up missing, the crew, which includes Captain Kirk (Ronald Russo), Sharon (Yvette Yzon), Snoopy (Filipino regular Jim Gaines; PHANTOM SOLDIERS - 1987), Fred (Alvin Anson), Mark (Gary ""King"" Roberts) and Victoria (Ydalia Suarez), must find a place to hide out and defend themselves from the living dead hordes. They find an old church and settle in, while Captain Kirk (a favorite joke name that Mattei used in many films) tells them that this must be the final resting place of an old Spanish ghost galleon called the Natividad, said to be carrying a king's fortune in gold. The next morning, the group (stupidly) split-up into three teams of two and explore the catacombs of the church. Sharon and Fred run into an undead monk and Fred blows it's head off with a shotgun. Victoria and Mark find a cask of old wine and proceed to get drunk, not realizing the the wine is crawling with maggots. The Captain and Snoopy make discoveries of their own, including a creepy old zombie woman who plays the lute. When the crew discovers the hidden treasure of gold, they won't get a chance to enjoy it, because they are attacked by hordes of flesh-hungry zombies. Fred (stupidly) sacrifices his life to the zombies so the others can escape. Sharon discovers a book that says whoever discovers the treasure will be killed by the pirate crew of the ghost galleon, who will rise from the ocean floor (apparently as vampires!) to exact revenge. Oh, great. Now the crew has to protect themselves from vampire pirates as well as zombies. To make a long story short, the crew dies one-by-one in various bloody ways (usually eaten in one manner or another) until only Sharon is left. She manages to make it off the island and is rescued by a helicopter, her story to be continued in Mattei's final film, ZOMBIES: THE BEGINNING (2007), although with slight alterations (The surprise final reveal here shows that Sharon is now a vampire zombie, but the sequel drops that plot point, making it a nightmare sequence in a hospital room instead).  While not a very good film in many departments (the dubbing and dialogue are terrible and the acting is way too bland), director Bruno Mattei (NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES - 1980; COP GAME - 1988, which also had a character named ""Captain Kirk""; SHOCKING DARK - 1989), who co-wrote the screenplay with Antonio Tentori and Producer Gianni Paolucci, does his normal routine of copying scenes verbatim from other well-known horror films and claims them as his own. Here, he lifts scenes directly from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968; The ""They're coming to get you Barbara!"" graveyard scene), Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE (1979; The pointy wood shard in the eyeball scene) and John Carpenter's THE FOG (1979; the ghostly, fog-shrouded pirate crew) and tries to tie it all together, but doesn't accomplish the task. The film seems too disjointed to make much sense and it's one of those films where the characters make the stupidest decisions possible (especially Fred sacrificing his life and offering his arm for the zombies to chew on!) just to justify the gory deaths that follow. Still, the makeup and gore effects aren't horrible and the Philippines location photography is very colorful, making this a perfect film for Mattei fans: High on gore, low on believable characters and originality. You'll know within the first five minutes of watching this whether it is a film for you. The film concludes with a dedication to actor Mike Monty (NINJA WARRIORS - 1985; JUNGLE RATS - 1987), who died while this film was being made, but he doesn't appear in it. Also starring Thomas Wallwort, Miguel Franco, Curtis Carter, Arash Donadoni and Lilia Cantapay.

8696109,5,B00RWCJXFC,"New from Intervision Pictures Corp./Severin Films is one of the last films from famed Italian sleaze God Bruno Mattei (under his Anglo-pseudonym Vincent Dawn). My personal history with my namesake (my middle name is Bruno..close enough), goes all the way back twenty or so years ago to when I was 15. Living in a Massachusetts suburb, I devoured any film with the word ""Zombie"" or ""Living Dead"" in the title after watching Romero's first three Dead films, Evil Dead and Dead Alive all for the first time during one school vacation. Soon after, I happened upon a VHS of a schlocky movie called Night of the Zombies which I ended up enjoying quite a bit. Several years later, I bought the DVD of another zombie film titled Hell of the Living Dead, which I soon found out was actually Night of the Zombies under another title. From there I happened upon other Mattei films from various genres, my favorites of which are Rats: Night of Terror and Women's Prison Massacre. Which brings us to our subject of this review, Island of the Living Dead.

This film begins with a group of treasure hunters who pull a treasure chest out of the ocean, only to have the bottom fall out and all of the treasure to fall to the bottom of the sea. Shucks. And then, as if losing a treasure wasn't enough, their boat crashes and the crew, along with Captain Kirk...yes, their captain's name is Captain Kirk...happen upon a seemingly deserted island. As you can tell by the title of this film, the island certainly isn't deserted, it's very much alive...with the dead! Does that actually makes sense? Who gives a s*** because what follows doesn't make any sense either! After all, too much sense (cents) makes dollars and that belongs nowhere near a Bruno Mattei film! Oh great, now I am writing plays on words. I think this film melted my brain. Anyhoo, the group come across a bunch of zombies...or are they vampires...or ghosts? Who the hell knows (I'm guessing not even the film makers)?

Island of the Living Dead fits well with Mattei's older films as well as his newer ones, including this film's sequel Zombies: The Beginning. Low budget, poorly dubbed and hilariously bad dialogue. But still very watchable, entertaining and above all the makeup FX are top notch! I do think Mattei's later films suffer slightly from the dissolution of his collaboration with writer Claudio Fragasso (best known for directing the ""best worst movie"" Troll 2), but only slightly. I would definitely recommend this film for old school Italian zombie fans because surprisingly not much has changed in Bruno's world. This nice looking release from Intervision features a trailer, sales promo and interviews with the producer and writer, giving some insight on how it was working with Mattei.",1449532800,,2756,4.812236286919831

8696112,2,B00RWCJXFC,"You have to be a forgiving fan of Bruno Mattei to like this movie.
This movie is monumentally bad, and not in the good way that would allow you to keep and watch it again because it's so bad it's actually enjoyable.  Besides being poorly made (poorly edited, poorly scripted, poorly acted), it simply does not make any sense.  The characters wander endlessly, swear endlessly, and routinely throw themselves into harm's way as though they are asking for it and really don't care.  Besides abrupt cuts between scenes, there are also abrupt changes in mood.  Everything is wildly exaggerated.  The actors don't interact with one another as much as they politely wait their turn at delivering the bizarre dialog in a most unconvincing manner (the dubbing doesn't help).  It's an outlandish attempt to make a new retro zombie flick that doesn't follow any rules in zombie lore.  It also feels at times like they are deliberately trying to make a bad movie.  The best thing about this movie is the cover illustration on the DVD.  I can't see keeping it just for that.

Before buying this mess, before watching this mistreatment of everything cinematic, I wish I had been properly and strenuously forewarned.  This movie boggles the mind and stretches all forms of credulity.  I watched it with mouth agape.",1427587200,5,1301,4.863636363636363

8696114,3,B00RWCJXFC,"If you are looking at this movie than you already know it is not that good. So, keep that in mind. The cinematography looks like it is a soap opera and the special effects are generally fine.

There are all kinds of nods to other movies in this. Night of the Living Dead and Hell of the Living Dead (another Mattei film) actually are the easiest to spot. It is nothing particularly special, but worth looking into if you are a fan of the man and his general style of film. It is a so-so zombie flick.",1425513600,,500,4.154639175257732

8696116,5,B00RWCJXFC,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If youve never watched a Bruno Mattei film, you are really missing out.  Renowned for over-the-top gore and horrible voice dub-overs, Mattei is a staple of Italian horror.  But unfortunately, many people find his films too campy to enjoy.  I am on the other side of the fence; I LOVE HIS FILMS.  Sure, they're schlocky and full of cheesebut that is what makes them so much fun!  Almost all of his titles are in my So-Bad-Theyre-Good category, but that is an honor, not an insult.  ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of his final films, as he died shortly after shooting it and ZOMBIES: THE BEGINNING back-to-back, but it is a capstone to a historic legacy of horror films.  Chocked full of the things that make his work great, this film is a must-have for zombie fans.

I never have discovered why Mattei chose to release most of his films under pen names.  Vincent Dawn, Pierre Le Blanc, Gilbert Rousselthese are just a few of the pseudonyms he used.  As you can see, the names are as diverse as his filmography.  I have to confess I know little about the man himself, therefore this might warrant some investigation on my part.

ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD is a typical Mattei flick.  It is low-budget fun, shot decently but at the same time looking kinda cheesy.  Again, this is not a negative, but a simple factual statement.

The acting is, as expected, not very good, and much of the dialogue is delivered in an overly-dramatic fashion.  Every time a character spoke, I was reminded of how comedians poke fun at William Shatner with their Captain Kirk impersonations; you cant help but grin when you hear them.  The same can be said here.  Although the dialogue attempts to provide information and move the story along, its almost so terrible to the point of distraction.

True to form, ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD contains plenty of Matteis trademark gore and zombie effects.  I love how he makes the dead look, well, dead.  Im sick of seeing zombie makeup that makes a person look white and lifeless; thats not what a rotting body should look like.  Much like Fulci, Mattei uses decomposing zombies in his films, and the result is spectacular.  Even so, there are some cheesy effects in the film as well.  For example, a man who is supposed to be a skeleton is wearing a black outfit with a skeleton printed on it.  The result is laughable but still a lot of fun.

ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD is a major win for me, and fans of schlocky, gory flicks should love it.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a good zombie-throwback film.  They just don't get much better than this.  ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD is available now.",1425340800,4,2697,4.512396694214876
