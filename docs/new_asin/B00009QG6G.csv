1888169,2,B00009QG6G,"I took my 13 year old step-son to see Agent Cody Banks as a treat, and as a movie we both thought would be fun from looking at the trailer.  His main comment afterwards was that he thought there was going to be a lot more action.  I enjoyed it, but it was also a lot less than I had been expecting.
The movie is obviously going to require some suspension of disbelief, as it plays well on the wish many kids have to have something special about them that is a secret, in this case that they've been trained from an early age by the CIA.  The main running gag, Cody's ineptitude in communicating with members fo the opposite sex, it also going to resonate with a lot of young boys (and girls).
Unfortunately, the gag gets old, and the occasional other laughs don't carry the movie either.  The relationship story between Cody and his assignment, Natalie, has the superficial quality that is characteristic of a lot of early encounters, and which is better than them attempting to make a deep true love story out of it, but the superficiality never really passes.
Action sequences leave much to be desired, rarely passing over into the realm of perceived danger to the characters.  Perhaps this would play better with a younger audience, but they would also end up missing much of the attempts at plot.
All in all, Agent Cody Banks is a fluff kids movie that isn't a horrible waste of an afternoon.",1048118400,,1396,4.480314960629921
1888170,5,B00009QG6G,"I'm sure all of you have seen the trailors on tv for this movie and it makes you want to go see it.  It's a very good movie!  I took my 9-1/2 year old to see it and the theater was packed!  Not only with kids but with a lot of adults (quite a few were without kid!).  Parents, if you want a nice, good movie for your kids to see then this is the movie.  Lot's of action, special effects but still down to earth and wholesome (none of this raunchy stuff nowadays.).
Cody Banks is your average everyday kid from Seattle, Washington who just happens to have been recruited by the CIA.  His assignment is to get close to.....a girl.  And from the trailors you can tell that Cody has a hard time talking to girls.
Think of this movie as a cross between James Bond & Spy Kids - it's kind of in the middle so pre-teens & teens will enjoy it.  Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff did an excellent job acting!
If your kids enjoy watching Lizzie McGuire and Malcolm in the Middle and Big Fat Liar then they and you won't be disappointed in this movie!  I can't give the plot away or why Cody Banks needs to get close to ""the girl"" but you'll figure it out and if you see the movie you'll enjoy it.  Go out and enjoy it together!",1047772800,14,1212,4.054621848739496
1888171,5,B00009QG6G,"I am a parent who took his kids. I thought it was very entertaining, with an excellent premise to the story. This is more in the flavor of a comedy-drama bond film and not the total fantasy of a Spy Kids.
More importantly, my kids and the others in the audience really enjoyed it. Based on audience reactions, I think the most popular age group will be 7-14. It is very well cast and performed (except Hillary Duff who has very few lines in the movie and manages to be Lizzy all over again); Frankie Muniz does an excellent job. Script is excellent. The inevitable sexual references are tasteful and kept to a minimum. No graphic violence or language. No really gross or off-color jokes. Only one visually disturbing moment at the end where the camera cuts to a few seconds of the villian's gruesome death. Frankie Muniz character has positive values. The CIA is shown in a very positive light (no liberal political correctness, thank you very much).
Overall a great family movie!",1047686400,10,980,4.637931034482759
1888172,4,B00009QG6G,"Quite possibly. Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) is a precocious teenager who has a lot going for him: he's bright, has a stable home life - not to mention warm and loving parents who worship the ground he walks on. Then one day at a seemingly normal day of school, this easy-going teenager is drafted by the CIA for their special teenagers program. Our crafty teenaged agent manages to get himself in one jam and out of another simultaneously, all encompassing many action-packed moments in their wake. But, Agent Cody Banks doesn't traverse through these adventures (and misadventures) alone, for he has a very sexy and intelligent sidekick (played by Angie Harmon) to help see his way clear. All through this ""crazy maze"" of adventure, Agent Banks must do battle with an evil Mr. Freeze-type character (including some snot-nosed preppy students), which brings about some successful (and not so successful) results, many of which the average moviegoer will find to their liking. Our suave and debonair agent has the acumen and book smarts to get himself through any situation...well, almost. Now, if he only could talk to members of the opposite sex more effectively, then he would have it made! Only two questions remain to be answered: Does Agent Banks get the girl, and do the bad guys win in the outcome? Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to find out the answers to these burning questions at your local theater today. After you've seen ""Agent Cody Banks"", you'll want to make it a must-have title for your VHS or DVD video library (coming soon)!",1047600000,3,1561,4.850187265917603
1888173,5,B00009QG6G,I saw the Sneak Preview ...and the movie was great.  Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff did great jobs and portrayed their roles well.  Good kids movie (James Bond for Kids and Teens).  Frankie and Hilarys character both very much differ from the characters on their TV Series.,1046563200,13,272,4.74468085106383
1888174,4,B00009QG6G,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought ""Oh man. Not another kiddy spy movie."" I was not a fan of the Spy Kids films and watching them with my little brother was torture. I took him to see this because I love Malcolm In The Middle and Hilary Duff is hot! The movie ended up being very good. I was shocked! The plot is like this. 16 year old Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz from Malcolm In The Middle and Big Fat Liar) was recruited as a C.I.A agent via a summer camp. Now he gets his first mission. To protect the daughter of a scientist (Hilary Duff of Lizzie McGuire and a Hollywood Records recording artist) who has gotten involved with bad guys (one of them is Arnold Vosloo from the Mummy and ABC's Veritas) trying to destroy the world with micro robots that can eat through anything but glass. The only problem is Cody has a problem talking to girls. From the action packed begining to really cool end, everyone will love this movie. The gadgets are awsome and not at all kiddy looking (like another movie about young secret agents that I know of.) It's not a James Bond rip off (like spy kids), the story is (unlike Spy Kids), The action scenes don't look cheesy (like spy kids). About the only thing I didn't like is Cody's annoying little brother. But he's not in it that much!",1046563200,33,1280,4.3153526970954355
1888175,5,B00009QG6G,"This is gonna be a great movie! Hilary Duff is a multi-talented actress, and Frankie Muniz is a great actor. With the two of them in a movie, the outcome is gonna be AWESOME!",1042675200,5,174,4.147058823529412
1888176,5,B00009QG6G,I think that Hilary Duff and Frankie Muniz are the perfect acting couple. Frankie and Hilary are both great actors and actresses. I just wanted to say that if Hilary or Frankie ever reads this that I wanted them to know that I am a HUGE fan of them both. Good luck guys. I can't wait to see your movie.,1042502400,,302,4.05

1888200,5,B00009QG6G,Cody banks had learn to get over his fear of talking to girls to be able to have a new mission. this movie has a lot of suspense.  It has a lot great characteristics. I would recommend this to any one. It is great for kids. Also Cody banks is not only  just a spy he is going to an school. Cody banks is a absolutely genius.

1888350,4,B00009QG6G,"Wasn't bad enough that Batman was doing it, now the CIA is also recruiting youngsters to help do its dirty work. When skateboarding Seattle native Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) was 13 years old he attended a summer camp that served as a front for the CIA's Agent Development Program. For decades now the CIA had been enlisting the most promising youths to its cause. Now almost 16 years old, Cody has just been activated for his first field ops. His parents, by the way, are totally oblivious regarding their kid's extra-curricular activities.

As part of his mission parameters, Cody transfers to a prestigious prep school and then faces the even more daunting task of getting an invite to the exclusive birthday bash of the most popular girl (Hilary Duff) in his new school. Never mind that Cody is abominably shy around girls. But a key scientist has vanished, a scientist who created a destructive form of nano-technology that, should it fall to the wrong hands, could spell serious suck for the world. Oh, and this missing scientist happens to be the popular girl's father. So can Cody Banks get over his bashfulness? Can he keep his cool around the school bullies? Can he get along with his stunning but no-nonsense new handler (Angie Harmon) and prove himself to the grouchy CIA director (Keith David, here having tons of fun)? And can he keep his nosy little brother from poking around with his private stuff (a lot of which comprises highly classified doodads and such)? The life of a teenaged suburban secret agent ain't all it's made out to be.

When I first saw AGENT CODY BANKS back in '03, I wasn't expecting much going in. But, it turns out, this is a charming and fun junior spy picture that hangs its hat on plot and character moments rather than on special effects alone. It falls in the same vein as ALEX RIDER: OPERATION STORMBREAKER and the SPY KIDS franchise, although it's more grounded than SPY KIDS. Not to mention, there's a nice element of TRUE LIES threading thru. This film seamlessly blends in an assortment of film genres, from spy thriller to teen romance to nerdy comedy. Muniz and Duff are both appealing and pair up nicely. Kids will get a kick out of the various cool and teen-oriented CIA gadgets utilized by Cody. And while Munoz clearly makes way for his stunt double during the action sequences, Cody Banks himself comes across as an intrepid CIA operative, never mind his lack of polish when around the chicas. It's tricky sometimes, having a kid trouncing a grown-up thug in a straight-up fight and making that look convincing (I'm looking at you, 3 NINJAS). But I think this film pulls it off. And once the film sold me on that one concern, I can roll with the rest of the wacky premise. 3.5 out of 5 stars for AGENT CODY BANKS. When it comes to onscreen junior espionage, it's on par with SPY KIDS but still has some ways to go to match my favorite example of this sub-genre, which is MAX STEEL. But go see AGENT CODY BANKS. Bring your kids. After all, this is more in their wheelhouse. And then stand back and watch them get all giddy at the notion of stuffy CIA operatives forced to do a kid's homework and chores.

He gets nervous talking to girls and is awkward in his attempts to get invited to her upcoming birthday party where he can snoop around for information. Cody Banks is a young James Bond type. He uses cool spy tools and highly trained moves though his parents are unaware of his agent activity. Angie Harmon is his handler who advises him before his missions.,1343520000,,498,4.606741573033708

All he has to do is cotton up to the daughter. There is just one problem when he sees a beautiful girl his head is full of cotton. There are a few good phony explosion scenes.

There is no real target audience. No well formed thoughts or follow through. The actors do not even try to act. The premise is lame.

It may not be a classic, but is full of fun and well worth watching. Cody is like Jason Steed, Alex Rider a young 007, teen spy.
Agent Cody Banks deserves much more attention than it gets

Plot: Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) learns he is a secret agent and he is brought in for training by Ronica Miles (Angie Harmon) who ends up his sidekick. He meets the CIA Director (Keith David) and prepares on his first mission while his parents, Mrs. Banks (Cynthia Stevenson) and Mr. Banks (Daniel Roebuck) along with his younger brother Alex Banks (Connor Widdows) have no idea what is going on. His mission is to get close to Natalie Connors (Hilary Duff) in hopes that she will invite him to her birthday party so he can use the opportunity to spy on her dad, Dr. Connors (Martin Donovan) because he is under suspicion for working for ERIS an illegal corporation. Complications arise when Natalie is kidnapped and Cody must rescue her.

The Good News: Right away the film starts with a big action sequence and it's a very impressive one at that. There is so much to like here it's a wonder that this series has never gotten as much attention as the Spy Kids series even if the second film is lousy. Director Herald Zwart brings a lot of flair to this film as the film is shot beautifully and never looks cheap or boring. The script by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski is never boring and never loses your interest when nothing is happening. The acting is great, long time friends Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff star and Hilary Duff shows the talent that would carry her through the next few years and Frankie Muniz is no slacker in the role of Cody Banks and it's no surprise that he would go on to be a star even if he never got as much fame as Hilary. The best supporting roles go to Keith David as the CIA Director and it's not a wonder that he returned for the sequel and the other one goes to Angie Harmon as Ronica Miles. She is energetic on screen and you fell her presence throughout the film. The plot, while nothing new proves you don't have to always have a fresh plot to make the film enjoyable. The film's tag line is one of the best and it sets the tone for the film, the running time is 102 minutes, but it seems a lot shorter than that and has a high re watch-ability factor. The action scenes are outstanding and the two that come off as the best are the diner scene and the ending. There are more such as when Cody is at Natalie's birthday party and he's spying on Dr. Connors and the beginning, it's really hard to pick a favorite one, but the diner scene and the ending come off as the best. I also recorded a few good laughs here and there between the action breaks. One of the biggest laughs is Ronica's first appearance, I don't want to ruin it for you as it is the biggest laugh our of the entire film. I'm also not a big fan of the boyfriend and girlfriend situation, but here is works well and flows well with the plot.

The Bad News: I couldn't find anything wrong except a few logical errors which every film has

Conclusion: If you like action or adventure movies then this film is definitely for you and if you haven't seen it already grab yourself a DVD copy today! Recommeded",1221177600,2,3412,4.301710730948678

And the DVD is good, too: you can watch it in widescreen or fullscreen, and I especially enjoyed ""How To Talk To Girls"" - don't worry, I know which is fact and which is myth.

And, did you know this DVD has an easter egg? While no website makes any mention regarding easter eggs on the Region 1 (this one) release at all, but there's plenty for the Region 2 UK version, this DVD (R1) actually has an easter egg! On side 2, go to the bonus features. On the first page, go down to the middle of the menu and press the left arrow. A circle will be highlighted. Hit ""Enter"" and you will see a minute-long deal from the director about goofs from the film (like when Ronica tries to take off her jet pack) and ends with ""From now on, when you see these parts, you'll know what's wrong!"" I was able to find this out because the menu designs for Region 1 are identical to those in Region 2, give or take a few MGM trailers. Editors: take note.

American and Canadian kids, if you want an exciting adventure movie, call for Banks...Cody Banks.

Actually, the only reason why I got the movie was because I liked Frankie Muniz's acting in Malcolm in the Middle. However, to my surprise, the movie was extremely entertaining.

Plot was a gold mine: Movie totally made sense didn't leave you guessing, you understood everything that was going on and they still managed to make it funny!

The acting was wonderful: Frankie (Cody Banks) did his usual great job as an actor, Angie Harmon (Ronika) did a spectacular job, and Hilary Duff has done better than ever before!

The gagets in the film were wicked (which is a synonym for the word 'very' if you don't live on the east coast)cool and realistic, all of the gadgets that were supposed to look like iPods actually did!

The action was the best: The actors did great jobs with all of the action they were involved in, and when the stunt doubles were used, which really wasn't that often, it was belivable.

Deffinetally deserves ***** and you need to buy it. In all honesty, In two days I had watched the movie twice, the movie with the commentary on, and all of the special features. On that note you deffinetally need to watch/listen to the commentary,it's funny and cool.

Overall, it's a must see, and it is the best movie I've seen in at least 5 years. On top of that kids, teens, and adults will all love it!

1888392,4,B00009QG6G,"This was a very stylish and respectful homage to the great Bond films.  Over the years, I have seen Hollywood disrespect this genre with horrible adaptations and overwhelming clichs that almost give the Bond films a bad name.  It always seems like if someone wants to make a spy film, you have to pay homage to the God of spy films, James Bond, and whether you give a good sacrifice or a bad one is how the audiences will react to the finished cinematic project.  Luckily, Agent Cody Banks gives a great sacrifice to the films and takes off running on its own two feet without ever disrespecting the genre.  Muniz is exceptional as the suave spy that has trouble with the ladies, and a strong secondary cast (that involves Hilary Duff, Angie Harmon, Keith David, and Ian McShane) only helps build the amazingly lighthearted feel to this film.  I was shocked how much I enjoyed watching this.  From the little jokes, to the copious amounts of action and violence, this film is one of those rare finds that works well for children, but also gives the adult at least an hour of entertainment.

I think what makes this a memorable film is the simplistic, yet very stylistic story that doesn't try to outdo itself.  I think that is where this movie succeeds.  In some spy films, the filmmakers are more centralized on the big explosions or the complexity of the bad guys plan, instead of trying to build a story from the ground up.  That is where Agent Cody Banks excels.  It gives us the heroine right up front as well as what he must do.  There is no wish washing around the truth, just a straightforward story that keeps your attention by giving us this portrait of an every-man instead of some super-sleuth.  The fact that Muniz cannot talk to women only grounds him and makes him more realistic and enjoyable.  I never found myself thinking about where this guy came from, how he spent his money, and what were his hidden dark secrets because ... he was a kid.  It was simply explained.  I completely demise those films that try to build more upon a character than what is needed.  This has the unfortunate side effect of ruining a story, but thankfully director Harald Zwart chose to stay on a very straight path.  With his focused direction and skillful editing, he creates a beautiful homage to the great Bond films that heartily deserved a sequel.

Overall, I was impressed.  I didn't think I was going to be and basically had written this film off until I actually watched it.  This is one of those multi-pleasure films where children, and adults, of all ages will grab ahold of something and enjoy it.  Me, it was the CIA director that continually made me laugh as well as Darrell Hammond's portrayal of Earl, the CIA scientist that equips Cody Banks with all the cool Bond gadgets.  His role was sheer dynamite and he did exceptionally well with it.  It is these types of surprises that allowed this film to keep its head above water.  Now, this film is no feat of brilliance, but it does provide a good hour and a half of entertainment that I was not expecting.  Check this film out if you are interested is trying something new and fresh.  If you are not a fan of the series, Malcolm in the Middle, do not worry, Muniz plays away from his television character and defines himself as a pretty decent actor.  I recommend it!

Films geared for teen audiences are often formulaic. Film studios seem to have a rather twisted idea that teens are interested in watching movies where the bad guys are bumbling idiots. If you look at today's contemporary literature for teens or young adults, you'll find that the opposite is true. The books that are being written (with the exception of spin-offs like The O.C. or Charmed) are usually intelligent. So why not make a movie for teens that's clever and thought provoking? Sure, the film made a good deal of money. Twenty-six million dollars was spent on its production, and it made forty-seven million in the theaters, and another forty-million for rentals. A good enough profit to make a second film.

This was above average for your typical teen film - but not by much. The formula is simple. A kid has resources that are beyond that of a normal kid (and yes, I understand that this is meant to be a self-esteem booster), he faces some fairly daunting odds, overcomes them, and gets the girl. That's the formula. Everything else is either peripheral (parents) or gadgetry.

That said, the action sequences in the film were believable and well choreographed. I have no idea if Frankie Muniz is skilled in the martial arts, but if he isn't, then the double they had stand in from him did a good job - as did the director for making it seem that it was actually Muniz doing the spins and kicks.

Still, I would like to see more films geared towards teens that reflect current trends of teen literature. The literature is getting ""smarter"", and so should the movies.",1110672000,6,1590,4.688172043010753

1888423,5,B00009QG6G,"Let me just get something off my chest. A lot of people seem to dislike Hilary Duff, who appears in this fun kids' spy movie. Just leave her alone! I like Hilary, she's very talented and good-looking and I suspect people knock her through sheer jealousy and lack her talent, so they knock people who DO have talent and waste time on the Web leaving stupid hate messages. GROW UP! Anyway, I disgress. On with the movie review. Frankie Muniz plays Cody Banks, a teenager who is actually a CIA teen spy in a special black project. He is assigned to get to an evil genius played by IAN McSHANE(from the BBC's Lovejoy series) via his daughter Natalie(HILARY DUFF - who was also in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and LIZZIE McGUIRE of course, a hottie these days)at an exclusive school. However, in spite of his great abilities as a spy, Banks just CANNOT chat up girls as well as Austin Powers. Ha! He learns that said genius is manipulating nanotechnology to his own means to take over the world(well what else?) and tracks him to his secret hideaway in the Cascade montains. You will surely guess the ending, however you will have fun watching this movie. Not just for the gags(particularly the obviously crude overcrowding of the surveillance van one and the obvious result), and Banks's poor chat up methods and how he has to be taught by the CIA to chat up girls, but watch out for the announcement about a silver Aston Martin at CIA HQ(actually filmed at a university outside Vancouver), Cody Banks's driving lessons at school, Hilary Duff in a school uniform(!!!), the SPY KIDS knock off gadgets, the well-executed opening and some eye-candy setpieces. Although it received a 12(our version of PG-13) certificate here in the UK, it is a great film for the famly to watch and is very suitable for kids in spite of some minor sexual references. Kids will also love the gadgets and action scenes. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel, which also is a plus point.

Sure, the movie is mostly just fluff and recycled bits from other movies, but it's entertaining enough that you can kind of ignore some of its faults.  Frankie Muniz is great as the young CIA agent thrust into a situation that he doesn't want to be in, namely trying to get some information from Hilary Duff's character.  The formulaic plot moves along briskly, and the action and comedy aren't top notch, but not bad.  I tend to enjoy a lot of the live-action family movies, and this one didn't disappoint me at all.

Hilary Duff is his would-be girlfriend as he freezes up when he talks to girls (stop it, you're killing me). Her dad is some scientist working for a madman (played by some overtanned Brit) and he has to infiltrate blah blah blah...

1888427,3,B00009QG6G,"""Agent Cody Banks"" is a perfect choice for the younger audience, especially those fans of Frankie Minuz and Hilary Duff, both familiar faces on TV.  Likeable and enjoyable as it is, however, adults would find its story predictable and its gadgets recycled.  Not that ""ACB"" is bad; it is just that adults (and the teens, probably) have already seen the ""Spy Kids"" films, which give us more innovative and original ideas.
Cody Banks is a 15-year-old boy who likes skateboarding but dislikes math.  But he is a junior spy on the government's payroll, and was recruited in the summer camp run by CIA.  Now CIA gives a mission to Cody, to save the world from the mass destruction by a misguided scientist (Martin Donovan with big glasses) who invented ""nanobots.""
Forget this silly story, and remember this.  This girl-shy agent has to get close to a cute girl Natalie (Duff), daughter of the scientist in case.  Muniz shows enough charms as geeky boy terrified by the opposite sex, and his disarming wit and looks are not surely to be found in ""Spy Kids.""  He is the most recommended thing in ""ACB,"" and you also see some funny scenes between him and Duff.  And one of the villains is played by ""Imhotep"" in ""Mummy"" series, who is also delightful to see.
""Agent Cody Banks"" is a well-made film as far as its production designs go.  And the gadgets are certainly interesting to see.  But in spite of these merits, the film is less amusing than Robert Rodriguez films, which know how to present these gadgets with imagination.
Interestingly, ""Agent"" credits five writers (including Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the team behind Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"") and sixteen producers (including Madonna ... yes, that's her!).  This is not a good sign, as far as my experience tells me, and actually ""Agent Cody Banks"" needs more creative minds than the number of the names suggest.

As teen escapism goes, it works well. The movie's adults are all clueless twits, as any teen will tell you. Our teenage hero combines the best of James Bond and Bruce Lee. If you've never been a teenage boy, trust me on this one. Living in a world with way too many restrictive rules really brings out such fantasies, and this movie brings them to life.
In fact, the movie is realistic enough to show the bane of every teenage boy: himself, frozen like a deer in the headlights, in front of a teenage girl. This leads to two things. First is the most hilarious scene in the movie, where the CIA brings in a half-dozen consultants to try to teach him about talking to girls. Second is the movie's PG rating - the hero's shyness makes even the movie's one kiss into a big (and chaste) event.

Frankie Muniz is just cool. I watch his movies like Big Fat Liar, and he plays Chester from FOP. He's a great actor. He has some cool movies and shows.
And that Hilary Duff...I don't know how to describe her. Well, actually, yes I know how to describe her...she's just HOT! She is SO much cooler than Muniz...well, actually, I like Muniz a lot, well, almost as much as Duff. They're both cool. And her movie character, Natalie Connors, was also funny.
The DVD features were very cool also. The deleted scenes, outtakes, the photos, director's diary, everything looks cool!

It's just dull, with endless scenes that scrabble for comedy and end up dragging their feet to witless conclusions. The filmmakers never treat their premise seriously enough to make the comedy bits stick; they simply have no framework on which to hang. Both Muniz and Duff are well-cast and overcome their teen-commodity images well enough the play their parts, but nothing terribly interesting ever goes on around them. The adult actors, with the exception of the dependable Keith David as the CIA head, treat the movie as a joke and give condescending, snide performances. (""Saturday Night Live"" actor Hammond is especially guilty of this.)
Younger children may enjoy some of the ""kid-empowerment"" scenes, but everyone else will be bored, especially the targeted teen audience, who would much perfer watching an Austin Powers movie or an actual James Bond adventure.

However, I found I enjoyed the whole film, mainly because of the good back up crew of actors.  McShane is superb and evil bad guy, Arnold Vosloo (the Mummy from The Mummy and Return of the Mummy) as his right hand enforcer, Angie Harmon as Bank's ""handler"" and Keith David (not David Keith mind you!) as the CIA director.

1888457,4,B00009QG6G,"When I saw Agent Cody Banks, I expected to see a rip off of popular action/spy movies dumbed down for kids. I pretty much got what I expected. However, what I didn't expect was that I'd enjoy it. Well, as it turns out, I did enjoy it...I'll admit some parts were really lame, and not all the jokes were all that funny, and the plot (if you could call it that) was unfortunately devoid of any twists or unforseen events. Anyhow, read on to see the rest of this review.
The movie basically started off pretty well, with a neat skateboard/car chase scene (unfortunately, as with any kid's movies, the ""accidental skateboarding tricks"" were way overdone), and then we got information on the bad guys, information on the good guys and information on what had to be done by the good guys to get rid of the bad guys. Like I said, the plot was devoid of any plot twists or unforseen circumstances.
Basically, Cody Banks is a teenager that has been secretly trained as a ""Junior Secret Agent"" for the CIA (the training done behind the veil of a Summer Camp). Of course his mission includes doing the one thing that he isn't good at, talking to a girl. The first time he talks to the girl, the bad guys catch wind of what he is doing and kill him!!!! No...that doesn't really happen...like I said, the movie moves along exactly as you would expect it to. I could explain the rest of the plot to you as well, but I'm sure you could guess it yourself, and if you can't, then I don't want to be the one that ruins it for you.
Anyhow, Frankie Muniz (of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" fame) plays ""Agent Cody Banks"" and he sort of fits the role of a kid that is put into a circumstance he can't quite handle, as far as the other actors involved...umm, let's just say their acting does a good portrayal of some of the acting by the Bond franchise. No, that's not a good thing.
Basically, the part of the movie I enjoyed most were all the little references to James Bond films. The movie was full of them! It was great! Another great thing was the gadgets...I love spy gadgets, no matter how unrealistic! The best part about the gadgets is the person that would be ""Q"" in any Bond movie...the guy who makes them...Darrell Hammond! Yes, the same guy that plays President Clinton on SNL is the gadget guy in this movie. It was a very pleasant surprise!
The action was enjoyable as well...the chases, the driving, the fighting, it was pretty much all enjoyable (except for some poor blue-screening at the very end...)! I give the movie a thumbs-up overall, basically because it was fun.
One more advantage to the film is that it was PG! Yeah, that's a little surprising, an enjoyable film that is PG...sort of goes against what our popular culture says about films. There was no swearing, no nudity, no sex, no drugs or alcohol...there was a bit of violence, but none of it (save one ""Indiana Jones"" style death in the end...) was gruesome or gory. In fact, the worst injury I saw in the movie was a bit of a cut on Cody's face. My official response on the movie is it isn't as bad as expected.",1064707200,,3067,4.382456140350877
1888478,4,B00009QG6G,"On a bored day, I decided that I'd go catch this film. Even though I knew it would probably suck. And it did. But I absolutely loved it. The film may have been directed towards the tweens, but it still managed to entertain me. Cody is basically your 'ordinary' teen, even though he's not doing what real 'ordinary' teens are doing (referring to the drugs/alcohol/sex problems). I reckon the real actors probably do this anyway. But yeah, we soon realise he went to a summer camp where he was trained to be a CIA agent.
On his first mission, he's got to get close to this girl Natalie (the CIA boss probably put on one of the most unintentionally funny speeches I've heard in my life), but Cody is really, well, not good around girls. He gets all this cool stuff (I wish my MP3 player could do that) and also has to stop these Nano bot things from eating all the metal. I dunno.
Yes, it's predictable. Yes, the specs are horrible. Yes, it's very unbelievable. But I really got into it, and it'd probably be a real good drinking film. So for all you out there who just want a good night in with a cheese film. THIS IS THE CHEESE FILM. Yes.",1064534400,,1137,4.293023255813954

1888480,5,B00009QG6G,"I absolutely have to give this movie 5 stars. It caught my interest and kept it the whole movie. I loved it.
It's about a Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) who has a problem talking to girls. He is 16 years old and has to get close to Natalie Conners (Hilary Duff). He has to do this because he is recruited as a CIA member, due to going to a ""CIA summer camp"" previously.
Natlie's father, Dr. Conners needs the funding for nanotechnology. The only person who would give him the money is a sinister man who only wants to use the nanobots to destroy America's weapons, so that he can have world domination. Of course, due to Cody Banks and the rest of the CIA, this fails. Also because this is a children-targeted movie, that is why it ends that way =).
This movie includes a lot of great special effects, and a lot of humorous teenage things during it. Such as when Cody goes to the party, and can see through everyone's clothes. I think everyone will enjoy this movie. This is a movie meant for the whole family to watch together.
The DVD features a lot of great things, including a few deleted scenes, some outtakes, and an exclusive Sneak Peak at the sequel.
The features are all very cool to watch, especially watching certain parts of the film from different angles, looking at the costume designs, and watching how they created the special effects.",1062633600,3,1347,4.4574898785425106

In the end, I liked it.  It was a lot better than Spy Kids 3, and was as fun, enjoyable, and imaginative as Spy Kids the original.
I would be careful in allowing the smaller children in seeing this.  There is a lot of prevocative references that made me feel uncomfortable having my son watch and a lot of insinuated cussing.  I felt that all of this was quite needless and this would have been a better movie without them.  Parents who care, beware.
As for the older children, they'll like it and relate to it as well.  We've all lived through the experience of not being able to talk to the opposite gender.  And what irked us more than being treated like children... back when we were children but felt like so much more.
No great morals or anything special to carry home afterwards, but if you want to be entertained with a fun movie, check this movie out.  And if you can't get enough, there are some fun DVD extras to check out.
Oh, they teased Cody Banks II.  A message to the creators:  Please, please don't follow the path of Spy Kids.  Keep it fresh.  Keep the story fun and identifiable.

1888484,3,B00009QG6G,"Position somewhere between Bond, XXX and Spy Kids, Agent Cody Banks is a pleasant popcorn movie that hops on the latest bandwagon in Hollyweird; take an adult genre, subvert it with lots of adolescent jokes, pepper it with some sharp, smart dialog and great stunts cook until done--poof! You've got an instant blockbuster with crossover appeal.
The casting is brilliant. Putting Angie Harmon (adult and adolescent male appeal)with Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz (adolescent girl appeal)and stir in Hillary Duff and you'll catch most of the movie going public. The real stars of the film, though, are the two villans played with manical glee by the marvelousIan McShane and Arnold Vosloo. McShane's been appearing a lot more lately in theatrical films. It's nice to see a familiar, talented face on the screen. He dives into his role with out any regrets. The same goes for Vosloo. Best known for The Mummy films, Vosloo has tremendous fun playing the bad guy. His work in the direct-to-video Darkman films as the hero are more in keeping with his witty acting style on display here than in The Mummy.
The film comes packed with extras but most of them are pretty light weight. The director/cast commentary is fun at times and its clear the cast and crew had a blast making the film. That carried over to the film as well. A pity that the only Bond joke is made in passing and buried in the soundtrack.
The main drawback to the film is that it is another Hollywood big production. What made Spykids so charming was the excellent production values, occasionally cheesy digital effects and the homemade quality of the film. Banks is a bit more cynically designed. Still, it's an enjoyable movie. Since there's already a sequel shooting, one hopes that they can keep the next film as fresh as the first but history dictates the opposite is usually true. Let's hope for the talented cast's sake that Cody banks continues on a couple more missions.",1060473600,,1949,4.803571428571429

1888516,4,B00009QG6G,"Did this movie seem to be like a Bond movie?  Yes and intentionally so...  And that is OK because I have all 23 bond movies.  Is this movie better than Spy Kids, SK?  Close.  Maybe better in some ways.  I like the casting of the two kids in Agent Cody Banks, ACB, better than the 2 in Spy Kids.  Yet, Spy Kids Had Zorro, opps I mean Antonio Banderas.
What makes this different is that Cody Banks, played by Frankie Muniz is just your ordinary kid who acts like he should be in special ed when around girls.  But Cody has been trained by the CIA as an agent and can handle fighting and tough situations.  The way it ends, one suspects strongly that there will be a sequel.  Arnold Vosloo, The Mummy, is in this movie as a bad guy and he sure is a cool bad guy.  Angie Harmon of Law and Order is the CIA agent who is Cody Handler.
There is no nudity and I only recall one remark that could be called swearing, so this is a family safe movie.  If you like Hilary Duff or you liked SK, you should enjoy this movie as much as my daughters and I did.  Strongly Recommended.",1060041600,,1067,4.047846889952153

But I was surprised to find the movie surpassing both my expectaions before reading the review and my expectations after reading the review. One thing, though, is that Agent Cody Banks should never, ever be compared to Spy Kids. One reason is that Spy Kids 2 and 3 were terrible, and not to mention unbeleivable. At least in ACB, he lives in a real place and works for the CIA (which is of course, real). In Spy Kids, they live on the other side of the looking-glass, work for the OSS, and have rockets built into their shoes.

1888521,2,B00009QG6G,"Whether you may or may not have watched the trailor and seen the reviews and promotions, you would probably have known that this movie was aimed at being cool and for teenagers. But what I want to say is that it is very bad example.
However, I have to at least tell you about the story if I want to convince you it IS very bad, because just nobody can believe something until they get to understand it.
The story is what you can call a spy movie and is about a CIA agent whose name is Cody Banks(Frankie Muniz), just like the title. And what is so different about this agent(and this is what they try hard to remind the audience at all times) is that he is only fifteen. He belongs to a CIA's young-agent program and although CIA spent ten million dollars on the program, they didn't teach him how to talk to girls. So problems comes when he was on a mission to make friend with a teenage gir, Natalie Cononors(Hilary Duff,) whose father is a scientist who has participated in an evil plan that may be able to destroy the world. And when the mission is completed and he is honorly dismissed, Natalie was kidnapped by the people in the plan in order to force her dad, who has determined not to quit the plan, back to work for them. The CIA says the thing is over and refuse to nose in, so Cody, being already fond of Natalie, maks up his mind to go back and rescue her alone.
Well, seems exciting, doesn't it? Only if not for so many faults. Hilary Duff looks so much older than the boy that it all seems unatural. I'm fifteen too and I don't think the average boys in my grade is this short and frail. The boy seems like another Harry Potter or another Frodo(both referring to the movie character instead of the book), and not a James Bond. He jerks his eyebrows together and around, he never looks excited or happy or scared, but only nervous. The only times when it looks better is when he kicked people sky high and even that, looks unatural.
Then when Cody's out on missions, the CIAs watch him so closely, worrying about him being captured(again remind us he's only fifteen and too young to be captured)that I totally lost interest and concern about what's happening. Since, if he's that all well protected, why should we care? And why should it be called an adventure if he can be rescued by his handler coming from the sky on an aircraft when even being caught on a burning tree?
And still there is the movie's unaturalness,sometimes even funny. Like, when Cody and his handler cautiouslessly land the aircraft RIGHT outside of the cave in which the bad guys camp. And the bad guys, not even aware of their existence, let them break into Natalie's prison room. And then they are being captured stupidly because Cody talks to Natalie freely not aware of the camera above. Shouldn't a well-trained spy be cautious and watch out for cameras? And shouldn't a big camp have cameras near its entrance? Natalie, the forever screaming girl, suddenly has the courage to stuff a deadly ""Nanobot"" into the bad guy's mouth. But why does the bad guy have to open his mouth and swallow it? Isn't it funny that he's willing to take whatever his prisoner holds out? Imagine if somebody pushes something you don't know to your mouth, even when you are relaxed and peaceful would you take it in without a look? And Natalie surely does't push it hard.
They say that the soundtracks of the movie costed the most part of the money but, why, it's only the replica of 007's latest one:Die Another Day. You don't have to hear it for yourself. Many parts are just the same music inserted with some crazy songs they think to be very ""teen-like"".
The movie is a disappointment and I wonder at so many reviewers giving it five stars. They say it's cool but it's not. They say it's for teenagers but it's not--I found Cody looking younger than Home Alone. They say it can be a family movie and, well, you can say it is--My father and I laughed frequently--not of the comedy elements in the movie but of it's akwardness.",1054944000,2,3997,4.424694708276798

1888556,4,B00009QG6G,"I give this movie a 4 because I got out of it exactly what I wanted - a great matinee that delivered comedy, action and stars that I really like.
Frankie Muniz is his likeable self as a highschool kid who went to spy camp. He gets activated by the CIA because he has a rep for being great with the girls, but of course we know he can't even talk to them. Oops! His handler is played by Angie Harmon, who has to be one of the most gorgeous women on the planet, and manages to be super provocative even though her outfits cover her completely. It's nice to see her do something other than her TV gig, and this is one of the main reasons why I say this movie will appeal to all ages. It's also nice to see ""The Mummy"" work some more, even if he is playing a typical bad guy.
So Frankie has to infiltrate a prep school, make friends with the daughter of a super-scientist, and save the world from nano-technology, while still living the life of a typical teenager. His parents don't know he's a spy, and this is where much of the comedy comes from - the CIA ends up doing his homework and his chores. All of the usual spy genre kicks are there - great toys, explosions, martial arts, and of course the bad guys have a great hidden lair full of super shiny metal.
This is a James Bond film for teenagers - no real blood or gore, minimal violence (comparatively), no sex (except for Angie oozing it out of her pores) and many more laughs. It isn't outre or odd like Spy Kids, definitely not as original in vision as the first, but just as fun if not more fun. I had a good time and all of my expectations were pleasantly met. Definitely a good matinee, maybe not worth full price.",1051401600,,1674,4.153846153846154
1888557,4,B00009QG6G,"Much like in the vein of the ""Spy Kids"" franchise, Agent Cody Banks puts some pint-sized (well, maybe quart-sized) heroes into the James Bond role and tons of action and adventure follow.
THE STORY:
Cody Banks (Frankie ""Malcolm in the Middle"" Muniz) is America's secret weapon against the evils of world conquering evil masterminds.  Part of a program of teenage/child super secret agents, Cody is brought in to infiltrate the family of a brilliant scientist who is suspected of developing a dangerous weapon which can be used to take over the world.  What is the key to getting to scientist?  Why, his beautiful and impressionable teenage daughter, Natalie Connors (Hillary ""Lizzie McGuire"" Duff).
The story basically sees Cody trying to Mack on Natalie while karate chopping the heck out of the bad guys and trying to maintain his cover with his schoolmates and family.  Spy-buddy chemistry is added in the form of Cody's mentor, the vivacious Ronica Miles (Angie Harmon).
THE COOL THINGS:
Well, if you loved Spy Kids, you'll equally love Cody Banks.  Aimed at the ""slightly"" older teen demographic though the humor is a little more matured with tons of school and teen-dating jokes permeating the movie versus the more ""kiddie""-based humor of Spy Kids.  The same amount of awesome FX, spy gadgets and karate action you expect from a spy movie are here though.
Also, fans of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Lizzie McGuire"" are also bound to love the movie as their heroes are the stars of the show.
THE VERDICT:
Come on, you know you want to watch it!  Wonderful for all ages.

First of all, this isn't a Spy Kids rip-off. I would classify it more as a ""James-Bond-for-the-preteen-crowd"" movie. It's been written to be fun, yet somewhat suspenseful (again, if you are a preteen) but never takes itself too seriously. What makes this movie fun for adults is the supporting cast. Let's face it, Frankie Muniz and Hillary Duff basically play their Malcolm and Lizzie characters here. No attempt at stretching their roles. I'm sure that's what the parts were written for them to do. However, Angie Harmon as the ""CIA Handler"" plays her part well, and is downright a pleasure to look at. You have to wonder, though, how many takes it took of Frankie falling face first onto her cleavage for him to get it right. Ian McShane playes a great evil genus, an of course Arnold Voolos (of ""The Mummy"" fame) steals just about every scene he's in.
Things in this movie that were not so good: The music was too loud at times, taking your attention away from what was going on up on the screen, The special effects were average, and the plot was kind of silly at times. But what do you expect from a movie for the Disney/Nickelodeon crowd.
So, overall, this movie is enjoyable. It's not something I would watch again (although my kids would, even my 15 year old). I would recommend it as a good family film",1048982400,6,1566,4.422145328719723

I especially loved the little humorous details here and there... like the page ""Would the driver of a silver Austin Martin please report to..."" inside the CIA building (James Bond's car), or Cody's cell phone that rings like Austin Powers video-phone. Pay attention when watching it as the movie is filled with little details and one liners referring to other spy movies.",1512777600,,410,4.774647887323944
