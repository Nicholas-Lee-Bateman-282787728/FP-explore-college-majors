8704285,5,B00U2YNMMW,"Satire. Busy satire. Almost too much. But a fun romp with ragtag superheros as they would look in real life. Everyone has a name straight out of a Walter Hill film. There's even delightful music interlude. Roger Wayne is heroic, Douglas Sidney is downright nasty. And where did tony Czech come from. This guy is simply...lovable! Don't think too much and you will enjoy this film. And DON'T try to figure anything out.",1432166400,,418,4.739726027397261
