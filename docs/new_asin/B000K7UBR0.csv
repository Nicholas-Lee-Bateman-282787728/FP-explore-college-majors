2684431,4,B000K7UBR0,"I love Rick Steves and bought this dvd to update the old vhs tapes I used in my Spanish class.  As a Junior High Teacher, I was dismayed that nearly all the paintings shown from the Prado were nudes.  Sigh.  My students just aren't mature enough to handle that so I stop the dvd after the visit to Parque Retiro.  Rick must not realize how many teachers use his products or hasn't spent much time around pre teens and teenagers.  I don't need their reactions or the parental phone calls.  Otherwise it would be a five star product.",1228521600,4,531,4.36734693877551
2684432,5,B000K7UBR0,"I bought this for my son who was going to Spain.  He tells me that RS books are the best thing he has seen for touring.  (He spent a summer as a student in Europe and has traveled to Japan, England, Amsterdam, etc. on business.)  His fiancee speaks Spanish and was able to ask locals where they should go.  The best advice they got was from Steves' book.  It made their trip much more enjoyable.  In the future, whenever he (and I) travel, he will have a recent Steves book to guide him to local highlights and to get the most out of his travel dollar.",1208908800,4,552,4.160377358490566
2684433,5,B000K7UBR0,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves?  This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

While each journey is only 30 minutes in length Rick has a unique talent of synthesizing the many facets that make up a people and place. He leaves no stone unturned in his analysis; historical background, spiritual heritage, cultural underpinnings and political legacy are all equally touched upon to give the audience a fuller understanding of the rural and urban landscape.

However not not an individual to dwell too much on the past, he provides a delightful tour of the markets, music, restaurants and nightlife. The kind of information would really want to know if you're out for a good time.

The production values are also wonderful offering fanstastic visuals that are worth watching even if there where no commentary. Traveling with Rick Steves' is the next best thing to being there.

This particular DVD contains six episodes, thirty minutes in length. Imagine three hours in Spain and Portugal await, better get started!",1207526400,12,1326,5.177570093457944
2684434,5,B000K7UBR0,It is indispensible to see what to expect on a visit to Spain and/or Portugal.  Since the Travel Videos cover 2000 to 2007 you can also see how things end to change over time in Spain.  These are my favorite Spain and Portugal travelogues.,1203379200,8,239,4.409090909090909

8154997,5,B000K7UBR0,"You can't beat Rick Steves for great travel information.  We have been buying his books, and watching his shows on PBS for years.  Last year we even took one of his tours in Italy.  We're planning a Spain and Portugal trip this year and in preparation rented one of his videos.  We picked up some great tips for our upcoming trip.",1398211200,,330,4.360655737704918

8155001,3,B000K7UBR0,"Preparing for an upcoming 2 weeks in Spain (mostly in Andalusia), I didn't think this added much to any guidebook. Instead of the details about Rick's meal of ham and the meanings of different fan fluttering maneuvers, I would have appreciated more discussion of how architecture reflects history, and more discussion with Spaniards about what differentiates their culture from that of other Europeans....  But what can you cover about a big, culturally rich place in such a short time, while trying to make it breezily interesting?
  I would still recommend James Michener's 1968 book Iberia for a view into the soul of Spain (as different as Franco's impoverished country was from today's democracy suffering from Eurozone success); and Maria Rosa Menocal's The Ornament of the World to connect the briefly glorious Cordoba caliphate and the 600-year Iberian convivencia of Muslims, Jews and Christians to the Spain that followed Ferdinand's and Isabella's fateful decision to establish an exclusivist and, eventually, spiritually (as wells as economically) poorer nation.",1364860800,2,1074,5.457831325301205
8155002,5,B000K7UBR0,"This was a gift, so I haven't viewed it, but have given it 5 stars because I always thoroughly enjoy Rick Steves' programs. Delivery was prompt.",1231286400,,144,4.576923076923077
