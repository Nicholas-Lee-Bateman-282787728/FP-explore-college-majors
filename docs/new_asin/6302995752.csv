7833305,5,6302995752,"I bought the film to watch Herbert Marshall.  I had to watch it 3 times before I could see him.  I could not keep my eyes off of Norma Shearer.  I love Herbert Marshall, but Norma is magnetic, electrifying.",1375401600,7,206,4.230769230769231
7833306,2,6302995752,"Relying upon reviews I purchased this movie expecting a ""glossy romantic comedy"". It's pure drama. Painful. I would rate it one star higher as a drama, but billed as a comedy, I do not recommend it.  I won't put myself through watching it again. Anybody want my copy?",1361491200,2,267,4.5625
7833307,5,6302995752,"I love old Hollywood movies. Norma Shearer is one of my favorite actresses of the 20's and 30's. She stopped making films at an age I consider still vital. She stopped when she was in her early 40's. Riptide did not disappoint because the acting was great and I loved the story. I wish she had made more movies so people who came after her could have enjoyed more of her work. She was a great beauty and I think Norma did an outstanding job in ""The Women"" which is on my list of favorite movies.",1357516800,4,495,4.166666666666667
7833308,4,6302995752,"I just watched this last night,so maybe I need to rewatch,but the package called this a comedy?I found it a romantic drama. But as always ,I love Norma Shearer.
I don't understand why she has been forgotten by the public at large?
She is one of my favorites of the 30's. I like her better than MGM's other female leads of the era,Joan Crawford,and Garbo!",1322524800,5,354,4.461538461538462
7833309,4,6302995752,"The plot of this movie is fairly simple. An american party animal(Norma Shearer) meets an english lord(Frederick Marshall) on the way to a party dressed in some pretty far out insect costumes. They never get to the party and in the process of getting to know one another they fall in love. Of course they are ""gloriously in love"" as it usually is referred to in all of the Shearer movies of that era. Our american girl Mary is transformed by love, marriage, and motherhood from devil-may-care party gal to the picture of societal respectability. All is well until she goes out for an evening with a former beau (Robert Montgomery) and gets drunk. Mary manages to keep it from going too far, but when her returning husband hears about her near indiscretion all hell breaks loose and the hubby assumes the worse. The rest of the story focuses on the resolution of their marital problems with complications from the ex-beau.
As I always state, most of the prints that comprise the Warner Archives releases are not remastered and are usually meant for true movie buffs who probably don't care if the image isn't all that crisp. That said, this movie is a lot of fun and put in perspective re: the era it was made it had good production standards, cool costuming, a decent script, a very good cast (including Mrs. Patrick Campbell in the minor part of Aunt Hetty and the three aforementioned actors who were big box office draws in 1934), and the very popular Edmund Goulding directing. While I cannot definitively say this movie was pre-code, it may have been since it touched on some sexually sensitive material but managed to not get too frisky.
This is definitely a Shearer showcase and is must see stuff if you are a fan of hers.",1306454400,4,1729,4.635179153094462
7833310,4,6302995752,"After filming 1932's STRANGE INTERLUDE with Clark Gable, Shearer would take an almost two year break from making movies. She would return to play one more pre-code enforced ""modern woman"" role in the the classic movie...

RIPTIDE (1934)

Here is yet another film of Shearers that is full of great sexy, ""pre-code enforced"" fun in the same vein as other great Shearer roles such as STRANGERS MAY KISS(1931), THEIR OWN DESIRE (1929) and THE DIVORCE (1930).

In RIPTIDE, Shearer is a notorious New York party girl who meets a stuffy but romantic British Lord played by Herbert Marshall while on their way to a costume party. They fall for each other immediately and have a whirlwind romance. When it comes time for Marshall to leave for England, he decides that he can't leave Shearer and proposes.

He takes her to England with him and they marry. Several years go by, they have a child and Marshall grows more distant. A bored Shearer takes up a friends offer to go to a party in Cannes. There she runs into old playboy friend Montgomery. After years of being cooped up with Marshall, Shearer lets loose with Montgomery and pushes the line of ""platonic"" but stays faithful to Marshall.

When a scandal sheet photographer takes a picture of Shearer and Montgomery, Shearers husband is outraged. Considering her past, he refuses to believe her innocence. They break up and Marshall is intent on divorce. Realizing this...Shearer really does cross the line with Montgomery, rather blatantly so. Marshall meanwhile has changed his mind and tells Shearer that he wants her back. Shearer begs Montgomery not to tell her husband about their affair, but news gets out and this time Marshall really does divorce Shearer.

However... this is far from the end for Shearer and Marshall and the movie doesn't end as you might expect. This one is directed by Edmund Goulding who directed a couple other famous soap opera classics, DARK VICTORY and GRAND HOTEL.

Shearer wears some wonderfully revealing outfits. She has without a doubt some of the greatest ""bare shoulders"" that these aged eyes have ever seen. Again...Shearer is able to pull off the unconventional, scandalous, sexy vixen while still being the fun, cute, witty girl next door.  The cinematography is lovely and the interior set design is also well done.

It was a shame that this would be the last of the sexy, indapendent party girl roles that Shearer would play. It would have been interesting to see her take the ""independent, fun loving woman"" role to another, more mature level. However, this would be the last role of that kind. After RIPTIDE, Shearer would be relegated to roles as put upon housewives and period pieces. Roles in which she was likable, but just didn't seem very at home in.",1243900800,9,2750,4.858974358974359
7833311,5,6302995752,"In this glossy MGM picture, ""First Lady of the Screen"", Norma Shearer, plays Mary, a reformed ex-liberated girl who marries into British Aristocracy, through the person of stuffy Lord Rexford, properly impersonated by reliable Herbert Marshall, who excelled in these type of roles, of dignified, formal and very moral husbands: I can remember ""Blonde Venus"" and ""Angel"", both opposite Marlene Dietrich, and ""The Little Foxes"" and ""The Letter"", both with Bette Davis, though one must never forget he once played brilliantly, a debonair crook and man of the world, in Lubitsch's masterpiece ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932).
The film is entertaining indeed, has a fine pace, although at the same time is somewhat episodic, showcasing Norma Shearer at the epitome of her movie stardom, in her last screen appearance with frequent co-star Robert Montgomery, who's very good as the extremely bon-vivant playboy Tommie Trent. Wonderful support by Mrs. Patrick Campbell as Lady Riversleigh, Marshall's naughty and mischievous aunt and by Lilyan Tashman as Shearer's sister, who, sadly, appears too little on the screen.
The movie's plot certainly wouldn't have passed the censorship some moths later, when the Production Code was fully enforced, because Shearer would have necessarily been punished for all the playing around with playboy Montgomery, while husband Marshall is away on a business travel, so it's pretty adult stuff by later Hollywood standards of the 1940s and 1950s.
You'll be surprised by the opening sequence, which shows Shearer and Marshall dressed in very exotic and sophisticated giant insects costumes, for a lavish party.",1042934400,19,1635,5.440944881889764
7833312,4,6302995752,"Norma Shearer is a carefree American who's married to stuffy English Lord Marshall; when Marshall goes to America on business, old flame Robert Montgomery follows Shearer home and there are scandalous consequences.....The highlight of this rather elusive (not easily found) film is the opening sequence which has the the stars dressed as insects at a posh costume party!  One of the very few films in which the legendary (and notoriously difficult) Mrs. Patrick Campbell appeared, this is a bizarrely entertaining, quality production with an inspired cast.",944697600,8,556,5.465116279069767
7833313,5,6302995752,"I had been trying to find ""Riptide"" for my video collection for some time. I really have to thank Amazon.com for providing me the opportunity to buy this out-of-print gem (and their great customer service  department). Norma Shearer was a great  actress on her own (despite the  fact that she was wife of MGM's head of production, Irving Thalberg, a.k.a.  Louis B. Mayer's ""wonder boy""). In ""Riptide,"" Shearer  plays Mary, a free spirit Park Avenue socialite who, through her  overly-developed sense of responsibility to an old flame, becomes  inadvertantly embroiled in a tabloid-type scandal. While her proper English  husband (Herbert Marshall) must travel to the U.S.A. on a working  ""no-wives-allowed"" junket, Mary travels the Meditteranean with  friends and is persuaded to help sober up her old flame (Robert  Montgomery). Through the classic comedy-of-errors formula, he winds up  drunkenly falling off her balcony into the hotel cafe below. The architypal  drawing-room love triangle plot ensues. Especially funny are the opening  scene, when the main characters are preparing to go to a costume party  dressed as giant insects, and the scene where Mary and her ""Aunt  Hattie"" get totally roaring ""tipsy"" in the study. Break out  the champagne and orchids, this one's a keeper!",943660800,27,1286,5.287128712871287
