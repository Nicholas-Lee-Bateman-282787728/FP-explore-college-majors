8460137,5,B00570N780,"Love these old Jack LaLanne shows are great! Each DVD (10 in the series) comes with 5 weekly episodes (Monday through Friday). The episodes are about 20 minutes long. Some of the exercises are harder than you might expect, especially, as you move up in the series. However, I would highly recommend for all ages. You can adjust the way you approach the exercises (make them easier by using a chair or harder by not using a chair and doing more repetitions).  The ""Glammer Stretcher"" is no longer available, but any resistance band will do. Highly recommend!",1422057600,3,557,4.742268041237113
