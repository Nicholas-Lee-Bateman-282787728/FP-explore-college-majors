5859806,4,B00DVLS8K4,"The Theo DVDs are great for christian parents who are looking for appropriate entertainment for their children. They do a pretty good job of teaching children Bible stories in a simple, straight forward, yet interesting way. I only wish there were more episodes on each DVD. The entire disk is only about 35 minutes in length.",1416096000,,326,4.839285714285714

8598335,5,B00DVLS8K4,"Theo is awesome! So many 'Christian' shows for kids are cheesy, obnoxious, and just plain 'out there.' What's the point?
Theo is Biblical and theologically sound, without being any of those things. Theo sings hymns, and not about cheeseburgers. What a concept. It's short, sweet, and to the point. (Thank you, creators and producers of Theo!) Each Theo DVD has three unique 10-minute episodes, plus a sweet Gospel presentation. The animation for the Bible stories is unique and impressive, very well-done. My 5 girls, ages 1-7, love Theo. (Okay, so the 2- year-old is a little scared of Scratch, the cat, but she doesn't watch it much and that's nothing we can't work through.) ;) I hope your family enjoys the lessons presented in Theo as much as we do!",1470441600,,754,4.8076923076923075

8598337,5,B00DVLS8K4,"I wrote a review of this series under ""Teaching children God's Word"". I absolutely love this video series. I highly recommend them.",1467763200,,131,5.0
8598338,5,B00DVLS8K4,"I absolutely recommend THEO. My kids and I love it. It is not watered down and the message of the gospel is well presented. There are 5 DVDs total with 3 episodes in each dvd and the ""good news"" is at the end of every dvd. Each episode (what is the church?, road to Romans, the fruit of the spirit, abiding in Christ, adoption, etc) is explained very well and it's so adorable and so well made! I haven't seen many kids Christian cartoons/DVDs that actually teach doctrine but THEO definitely does. Just because kids are young it doesn't mean that they can't understand theology or we shouldn't teach them that because it's deep.  I find it disappointing that most materials for kids are shallow and fluffy these days. My only dissapointment is that I wish there were more THEO DVDs.",1466812800,,783,4.553191489361702

8598340,5,B00DVLS8K4,Great and not cheesy. I am very picky about Christian videos.  This is the same caliber as 'What's in the Bible'.  Very well done and not even painful for parents to sit through.,1452729600,,178,4.363636363636363
