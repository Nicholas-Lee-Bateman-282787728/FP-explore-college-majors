7498096,1,B017A8EKN2,"In my humble opinion...this was a rip off! A major rip off. I have all Adele's CD's, DVD's & 3 of the 4 books that I know are out there. This was something I thought might be new & was excited to get it. When I opened it, I found the EXACT same DVD I already had and a CD which was basically the audio of the DVD!  On top of that I paid more for this than I did for the same DVD I purchased before.  I have no idea how this ever got out there for purchase.  The biggest rip off is that I pre ordered this...Major disappointment...Major rip off!",1457049600,6,544,3.8392857142857144
7498097,5,B017A8EKN2,"While it was a pre-order, not being released until February, the the recipient loved it when it arrived.  Almost like a second Christmas.  This rating is based on the recipient's review.",1456963200,,186,4.967741935483871
7498098,3,B017A8EKN2,"This is not a music DVD / CD album.  This release is a bundle of two previous Chrome Dreams releases. The Compact Disc is ""Adele: X-Posed: The Interview,""  released in 2011, is an audio book comprised of several interviews with Adele.  The DVD is ""Adele: The Only Way Is Up,"" released in 2012, is a documentary/biography of Adele told through interviews and video clips.  If you did not already own either the CD or the DVD already, then this would be a good buy.  If you were to purchase either the CD or the DVD separately, then it would probably cost more.",1456012800,13,559,4.4411764705882355
7498099,1,B017A8EKN2,Packaging is VERY misleading!!!! I was so excited to get this in the mail today!  When I opened it i found the cd...which is cool...but the DVD is Adele-The only way is up..which I already have!  By having to pre-order this...when this DVD has already been released i thought I would be getting something NEW!  Andddd the back of the cd case says there is a BOOKLET of rare photos...there is a 1 page booklet with 2 pictures ive seen a million times!  And I can't find a contact seller button anywhere. I am a HUGE Adele fan and I hate to rate anything with her name on it so low but I am so disappointed =(,1455580800,12,607,4.162393162393163
