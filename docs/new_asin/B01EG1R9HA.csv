7734649,2,B01EG1R9HA,"The Frankenstein experiment was interrupted during WWII, but his brain and heart were saved. Now sewn together parts of a shark....oh this is just too silly to continue.

The Polonia brothers are known for making bad campy films. To that extent, the rubber shark and bad CG special effects were in full swing. They mentioned another famously bad film, ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" however what Mark Polonia may not realize is that if you want to make a bad cult classic film, you don't do it by trying extremely hard to make a bad film. Also if you are going to claim to name all the Universal Studios Frankenstein films, don't leave off ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" one of their finest. The jokes were not funny enough to laugh at and when you expect a bad film, getting one isn't that funny either. PLOT SPOILER: irritating Skip, dies too late to save the film.

If you like their other work, you should enjoy this one. No surfers in film as depicted on cover.

Guide: No F-word or nudity. Was that supposed to be sex?",1473292800,2,1029,4.551351351351351

7734653,1,B01EG1R9HA,"The picture alone was just enough to peak my interest because I have always had the pleasure of enjoying B+ movies every once in a while, but once the story began with two characters being eaten it went all downhill from there.

I'll be brief to spare those who are about as interested as I was in the beginning.

This in a nutshell contains a boring story, lackluster and uninteresting characters, terrible acting, horrendous computer graphics, annoying repetitions of sound textures, and a depressing conclusion. The only good things were the cinematographydespite a few scenes being repeatedand the HD camera. That's it.",1499472000,,623,5.098039215686274

7734655,5,B01EG1R9HA,"Awesome Special Effects! Amazing Acting! Astounding Script!
These are just a few of the things you will NOT find in Sharkenstein. What you WILL find is a nerdgasm of fun!

I found this little movie to be absolutely delightful. Its tongue is firmly in its cheek and if you watch it with that in mind you can giggle your way all through it. Jeff Kirkendall is my favorite Mad Scientist of the last 20 years and the rest of the cast are a real treat!

I came away convinced that it must have taken some really talented people to bring this mashup of JAWS, FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD, and just all around shlock & cheese together!

Thanks to all involved for giving me an afternoon of much-needed silliness to counter current events!",1499299200,3,734,4.545454545454546

7734657,1,B01EG1R9HA,"Free is the correct price for this one. I'd say you really have to like bad movies to hang with it to the end. .
If you can be settled on the fact that they spent like 5 bucks to make this you may even appreciate it- lol. So yes, Ultra :Low Budget Eveything. Seems like they came up with this cool concept and figured they'd betterr hurry up and make it before someone else did. Nevermind that they had nneither financing nor a clue. Wouldn't suprise me to learn that the whole thing went from story board to in the can in a couple weeks.

my randomn takeaways;
They totally phoned in the ""Special Effects;"" but in a funny way so that it's obvious they weren't even trying to pretend that they were good.
The Duke characters seemed like an actual actor, maybe. Girl is cute, keeps it conservative.
Not totally clean. Tasteless and needless scene out of nowhere depicting rape as funny and enjoyable. If you don't mind this porn star moment and rape used for your amusemnet well ok then. To me this was over the line and is so disrespectful of women that it really discredits the whole thing.
Big Ass Spider (also on Prime) would be a way better choice if you need a cheesy slumber party movie for bigger kids.
Sorta slow as the story sets up... and the whole thing is not exactly a thrill ride.
My favorite is when Duke is preparing to go rescue Hoskins... in the same boat that Hoskins is suppossedly stranded in out on the water. Only looks slightly different because they put the cover over the open bow in Duke's scene.... check the numbers on the ""two boats"", they match! Guess they only had one buddy who owned a boat..
Note the grown up ""kids""who are way too old for the part... but i guess wearing your hat sideways takes off a few years!
Use of stock footage (and reusing shots) saves money but it's sometimes hard to tell if our beach story takes place in California or Alaska. Continuity nightmare.
Gory in a:""Happy Tree Friends is more realistic and graphic"" kind of way.
You can pretty much fail and still get seen on Prime based on my viewing experience.
If you like to Riff 'em yourself this might be for you.
Would have been a staror two better if they had left out the rape thing.",1498262400,2,2197,4.3585365853658535
7734658,1,B01EG1R9HA,"Another in the series of crazy shark movies, Sharkenstein features an insane story line, porn-quality actors and some pretty bad special effects. But, it does entertain. Had a lot of laughs with this one.",1494806400,,204,5.029411764705882

Interesting premise, but completely ruined by horrible, horrible acting, special effects, and snail-like pacing. I enjoy the ""so bad they're good"" films, but this one is just so bad it's bad. Go for it if you like inflicting self-punishment (I'm ashamed I wasted over an hour of my life). Otherwise, avoid at all costs!",1505692800,,421,4.702702702702703
