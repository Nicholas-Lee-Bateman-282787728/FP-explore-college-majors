3002605,5,B000XJ5UEO,"Not a run-of-the-mill slasher movie but a scary thriller that has many twists and turns. I don't recall another recent movie like this one - it has a Hitchcock or film noir feel. The acting is excellent and Wes Bentley gives a great, restrained performance as the troubled witness. I was on the edge of my seat during the film. The violence might be disturbing to some but it is not gratuitous. This is a movie that is enjoyable because it is so different, unpredictable, and thought-provoking. Not a typical Hollywood movie.",1202428800,16,525,4.717391304347826

8228355,4,B000XJ5UEO,A good look into the mind of a serial killer. Some great kills and fantastic acting push this film far. I'm very surprised by the attention to detail. This movie is tense and a good watch,1384560000,,187,4.222222222222222
8228356,2,B000XJ5UEO,"I still can't figure out why Wes Bentley of ""American Beauty"" stardom has relegated himself to films that barely make it to a public audience. While this film may feature good production quality, fine acting, and an attempt at a new perspective...it ultimately fails in all respects. Not even good acting can make this film interesting or plausible, it's entirely skeletal in its plot line.",1340928000,,390,5.015384615384615
8228357,3,B000XJ5UEO,"Let me comment on the comparisons of this movie to ""Mr. Brooks"" or
""Henry.""

This one is absolutely NOT in the same league as those very well-done
films, particularly ""Mr. Brooks"".

Unlike ""Mr. Brooks,"" this one gives no more insight to the mind of
a serial killer (or even to the interaction of other people with the
killer) than an average ""48 Hours"" episode would. In my opinion, the
characters here are flat or, at best, two-dimensional, while ""Mr.
Brooks"" is amazingly written to provide real character depth. So if
you're looking for a psychological thriller that *could* be real life,
go rent ""Mr. Brooks"" instead, because you won't find that here.

But if you've already seen ""Mr. Brooks"" and have nothing better to do,
AND you can watch this for free, then it's entertaining for a night. I
especially enjoyed the last 1/2 hour or so, and it is there that this
film finally becomes somewhat worthwhile.

On a whole, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the interaction and
a few surprises. But caveat emptor -- if you are a fan of depth
of character and intelligent, probing writing and acting, don't expect
this to be the 5-star movie some reviewers here seem to think it is.",1326412800,,1185,4.655502392344498
8228358,5,B000XJ5UEO,"In THE PERFECT WITNESS, Wes Bentley (AMERICAN BEAUTY, P2) is Mickey, a documentary film-maker who tracks down a serial-killer named James Lemac (Mark Borkowski). Rather than turn Lemac over to the police, Mickey decides to film the notorious murderer in the act, so he can blackmail him into being the subject of his latest documentary. Mickey's plan seems to work at first, forcing Lemac out of the shadows and giving Mickey some priceless footage. Unfortunately, Mickey totally under-estimates Lemac, forgetting that he is ruthless, vengeful, and homicidal. The proverbial tables are turned back and forth, making for an excellent thriller w/ several nasty twists and unexpected revelations. Along the way, we find out what Mickey is really made of as he tumbles into full moral decline. WITNESS has a few hard-to-watch scenes, including snipets of a rape that show Lemac to be the monster we knew he was. So, be stout of heart if you want to fully enjoy this one. It's well-deserving of its R-rating...",1262390400,3,1005,5.0602409638554215
8228359,4,B000XJ5UEO,"I rented this movie and put off watching for awhile, I wasn't even sure if I would make time for it. I;m glad I did!! This movie is dark and disturbing, and it goes through the main poor decisions twice, so the audience can see exactly how a serial killer, hunts and kills. He did open up about his terribly abusive mother, whose memory haunts him and his sister, but I'm not sure if the sister was beaten like the son was. He chooses slim, dark haired women, guess who they look like? Dear old mom. By the way, how did hi mom's life end? When did it? This movie opens with and a shock and ends with one.",1217289600,,604,4.084033613445378
8228360,1,B000XJ5UEO,"In the first few minutes we see Wes Bentely in a dark alley witnessing a murder, while holding a video camera. The killer chases him & eventually he's forced to think fast to stay alive. He offers the killer a deal. Allow me to film you killing people & I promise I won't release the footage till after you're caught. He also thinks he's safe since he doesn't fit the profile of the killer's victims. This is absurd. Not only would he  become an accomplice, but to think he's safe is more of a stretch. This film is not scary whatsoever, it is very low budget & the supposed plot twist is nothing new. ""Identity"", ""Fight Club"", ""Mr. Brooks"". Wes's mother gets kidnapped by the killer to give the killer an edge? Later we find ""the mother"" is someone entirely different. PLEASE..............Not worth the time.",1209081600,2,809,4.5793103448275865
8228361,2,B000XJ5UEO,It was an original story but the acting and screenplay were not worthy of more than a 2 and a half star rating.  The story progressed methodically and the acting was not very good.  I think the lead actor could develop into a good actor but in this film he is too green.  I really did not like this one too much and would only recommend it as one that you watch for free on a movie channel.,1207699200,2,390,3.9743589743589745
8228362,5,B000XJ5UEO,"Given the resources, this was an outstanding, surprisingly well-made film.  Borkowski is not only impressive in his portrayal of the serial killer- who is actually more level-headed and logical than all the other characters around him- but he (along with Thomas C. Dunn) also wrote the story.

Also noteworthy is the inclusion of the realistic profile that killers could be people who do charitable work under the watchful eye of the public during daylight hours.  There are so many movies that show antagonists in an absolute black-and-white portrayal, and this is simply not the case.  We often hear news reports of monsters being hauled away when neighbors are interviewed afterwards with astonished faces, saying ""he was such a nice, quiet person with good manners.""  In showing this, Borkowski and Dunn gives the film an added angle that a murderer could be any one, just around the corner, your neighbor or mine.  And that's the primary key to creating fear, because when you walk out of the cinema or finish the dvd, you will look at your nice, courteous neighbors with a sense of doubt.  You are no longer that sure...just like waking up from a nightmare involving your partner (who is sleeping next to you) hacking you to pieces and asking yourself, ""how safe am I?""

Entertainment is not meant to go down that route.  But if the creators set out to do that, they have suceeded here.

It is probably safe to say that most, if not all of us, won't have any idea how a true serial killer behaves, let alone what goes on in his or her mind.  But a storyteller like Borkowski & Dunn utilizes our collective perception to create a recognizable atmosphere of dread.

This movie will inevitably be compared to Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer, but it is a far superior version of it, combining a social and moral dialogue on the media's and public's grim fascination with murderers.  It does this in a way that is more accessible than Michael Hanneke (eg. the original Funny Games).  One of the premise is this: It's all very interesting to learn and watch a demented person when you are on the other side of the lens, but what happens when that demented person arrives in your backyard?

The grey zone is so blurred here, one doesn't know whether to be more disgusted with the serial killer for doing what he may have no control over, or the film-maker, who choses to hold the camera, yet pleads with his star not to kill the victim when he's around: ""We don't need to see this, we can hear about it"" or ""You don't touch anybody or hurt anyone when I'm around.""

There are twists and turns that keep the story from falling flat on its face.  Bentley's acting is a little bit below par, but overall, Borkowski has shown here that with adequate craft in storytelling, superior acting, and the proper use of background music, one can create a high-strung, tension-filled movie with a modest budget.

Considering all these factors, Perfect Witness is easily the most impressive sleeper I have seen from 2007.",1205971200,6,3009,4.688212927756654
8228363,5,B000XJ5UEO,i just watched this the other day and i was quite pleased.  for a lower budget this is a good film.  its creppy and it makes you think.  worth a watch.,1204934400,4,151,3.806451612903226
8228364,4,B000XJ5UEO,"I always imagined that someone in the world of reality TV would actually attempt what this movie chronicles - a filmmaker capturing the activities of a depraved serial killer. Well, obviously there'd be some moral concerns (rightly so) with the concept, but this movie also explores what else you'd find on that particular downward spiral. Highly suspenseful and engrossing, you can't help but feel trapped, much like the main character in the film, played convincingly well by Wes Bentley. I had the opportunity to watch this one on the independent circuit and was surprised. A strong debut for this up-and-coming director. If you want to be a bit disturbed, this will do it for you.",1202601600,13,684,4.956521739130435
