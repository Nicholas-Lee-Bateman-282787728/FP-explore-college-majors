Seu Jorge and company play up-to-date Brazilian soul music - Indio, Bahia, northwest, Rio, every style - carnival & afro samba, ballads, bossa nova, reggae, jazz and rock crossover - they've got it all. I've been a fan of Brazilian music for many, many years, as well as Jazz, Classical, and just plain rock/indie/soul/whatever, and this is darn near my favorite concert I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy! Thank you Seu Jorge!!!",1354320000,,547,4.829787234042553
