3421297,1,B00009VU27,"In spite of the gallant efforts of Michelle Greene and Erica Shaffer, this thing is a bomb! Helen Lesnick thinks way too highly of herself (that she has written a good story, that she can pass for 34 and that she can act!) and she drags the movie right into the trash can along with her ""talent"". Sorry but the truth hurts. Don't waste your money; instead, try ""Fingersmith"" for a well written story and well developed characters.",1148256000,,430,4.5256410256410255
3421298,4,B00009VU27,"""A Family Affair"" is a fun lesbian flick that has some clever little one-liners and simple, likable characters.

The main character, Rachel, is a high-strung, embittered New York Jew who moves to southern California to be closer to her overly-supportive PFLAG family and to escape her tumultuous relationship with a long-time girlfriend in New York. Begrudgingly, she lets her mother set her up on a blind date which indeed results in love, but with some classic lesbian twists, including an ex thrown into the mix.

I would have given this movie more stars if the character's hadn't seemed so one-dimensional. Though, admittedly, these simple traits somehow make the movie work. For example, the new girlfriend is a big, heaping serving of pure apple pie and batty-eyed affection. On the other hand, Rachel is consistently trite and appears to be mocking everybody around her, including her new love; while the ex is exclusively malicious with destructive intent. All in all, despite the flat roles, the characters create a dynamic group and successfully play out the well-written score.

This movie is good for some light-hearted lesbian giggles and easy entertainment.",1123027200,,1171,5.218085106382978
3421299,1,B00009VU27,"Cause after you buy this movie you will want to have a funeral for your wasted money. This is movie is...so beyond horrible. Honestly, forcing people to watch it could be a form of torture. I had a deep feeling of dread when in the first 2 seconds of the movie main actress starts talking to the screen. My dread grew to absolute horror in the first 3 minutes when I realized with out a doubt that the main actress COULDNT ACT TO SAVE HER LIFE! And As I said in the first sentence. I felt like crying for my lost money when after 15 painful minutes I realised NO ONE in the movie could act and things were not going to get better. Save yourself and leave this movie on the shelf.

Honestly, how do some movies get funded?",1112918400,,721,4.15
3421300,1,B00009VU27,"This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever witnessed...gay or straight. I am amazed it actually got made, let alone distributed!

I hate to be mean, but it was hard to watch Ms. Lesnick. Her talents must lay elsewhere. She can not act her way out of a box. Oy!! She should have stuck to her Rabbinical Studies. Seriously folks....you should just rent it to see how bad it is...you will be fascinated.

I am sure Helen Lesnick is a lovely hard working woman, but what a flat actress. Her heavy black and blue makeup made her look like a Drag Queen and the fact that she says she's 34 in the film is insane! She clearly looked 45 +. I am all for accepting yourself as you age, but the woman had such deep lines in her face, she looked like road map. If you force us to stare at your face for 2 hrs (and tons of annoying Close Ups!! Oy again!)please consider Boxtex next time.

Well she got a film made and out there, starring herself as the lead. I am sure a great accomplishment for her...BUT, PAINFUL for us.",1111104000,,1017,4.178571428571429
3421301,1,B00009VU27,"I knew when I ordered this it had received mixed reviews but as always went ahead and ordered it with an open mind. Knowing that as with most things that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When will I ever learn, good quality lesbian films are few and far between and sadly this is one of the misses. The fact that you cannot give zero or minus stars gives this poor film a falsely high rating. The acting is wooden, scenes and script uncomfortable. Other reviewers mention great sexual content, steamy scenes and sexy performances. Which film is all that in then, as I didn't see any of that in A Family Affair. If you can I would rent this DVD rather than buy or borrow would be even better, that way your hard earned cash remains safely in the bank and no one gets hurt.",1107820800,,776,4.25
3421302,1,B00009VU27,"Maybe I can't rate a film based on the entire fifteen minutes I've managed to watch of it. Nah! Sure I can!

This film exhibits one thing about lefties and homosexuals, that I, a leftie and a homosexual, cannot stand: the perpetual and extremely irritating tendency to preach to the choir. Within the first five minutes Lesnick has turned to the camera and begun lecturing the audience: ""If you don't like the idea of a lesbian wedding then get used to it!"" Something along those lines anyway. I wondered upon viewing this travesty what Ms. Lesnick was thinking. Who in the hell did she think was going to rush out to watch this thing? Evangelical Christians?

Oddly enough, I rented this film inspired by Lesnick's statement that she was trying to make a film where the gayness was not the central issue, and there she is, giving a kindergarten lecture on diversity in the opening scene.

Also, when the character playing the mother looks younger than the protagonist, you've got problems.",1107475200,,990,4.777777777777778
3421303,1,B00009VU27,"I picked up this movie on accident, but I doubt that it was fate! It's not horrible, but rather unnatural (acting) and uninteresting (plot, direction). I wondered how a movie like this could be made? And why? However I'm strangely fascinated by this film because I actually attempted to see it a second time, because I just couldn't believe that such a horrid movie could be made. Despite my good intentions however, I could only take the film for about 10 mins the second time around. Some gay films are really bad in terms of acting and story line, but this one takes the cake! Why do some gay movies have to be so bad? I haven't found an answer to that one yet, however I have a feeling that it's a conspiracy. The Republicans are funding terrible gay movies to make the entire population straight! ;)

If you like Bar Girls, you may like this one. However, if you like High Art and But I'm a Cheerleader, your best bet is to run as far away from this movie as possible.",1106524800,,973,4.346153846153846
3421304,1,B00009VU27,"Poor acting, poor writing, poor direction... and you can attribute it to one person... the lead actress, writer and director, Helen Lesnick, who is deluded enough to think anyone would believe two fairly attractive women would fall for her whiney self. Terrible, terrible movie. Anyone giving this more than 1 star (because there is nothing lower) obviously works for the production/video company and has some sort of vested interest in making people buy this atrocity. Michele Green is the only thing good in this movie.",1104192000,,521,5.141176470588236
3421305,2,B00009VU27,I'm trying to understand how people reviewing this film are saying it is the best ever.  This is on par with Claire of the Moon.  The fact that the lead actress is also the writer/director should explain why the story line doesn't make any sense.  I didn't believe that this whiny unattractive woman with no observable charms could have two hot women fighting over her.  Maybe in Helen Lesnick's fantasy world that happens to her but it doesn't make for a good film,1103587200,,465,4.566265060240964
3421306,2,B00009VU27,"A few funny scenes, and a lot of J.A.P. angst. If you're looking for a heart-warming romance, or some kind of sexual intimacy portrayal, don't stop here. Ain't. Borrow it or pay the 3 bucks to rent it. Then decide. Not to. Oy vey!",1099958400,,230,4.25
3421307,1,B00009VU27,"DO not buy this film. I rented it the other night and it was a waste of four dollars. My girlfriend fell asleep within 5 minutes, but I actually watched most of it.

 The story is drawn-out and boring. There is no chemistry between the actresses. The humor is deliberate and unfunny. You can look forward to jokes such as ""I stand corrected- or rather-sit corrected."" (the character is sitting.)

 buying this film will only encourage these people to make more movies. It's up to you.",1090972800,,484,4.593023255813954
3421308,1,B00009VU27,"I saw the start of this movie on my mom's TiVo but it did not record the whole movie. I thought the opening was cute and funny. So I rushed out and rented the DVD. Boy am I glad I only rented it. The only good thing about the whole movie is that its filmed in San Diego (my home town) so I knew the areas they were in. Other then that it was all around lame. If you must see it RENT IT DO NOT PURCHASE, unless your looking for a dust collecting DVD to add to your collection.",1088553600,,475,3.76
3421309,1,B00009VU27,"What a complete and utter disappointment this movie is. The acting is atrocious, with the characters lacking depth and a story line to match. The lead character is frustrating, with the actor simply kidding herself to be lead role material. I purchased this movie in good faith that finally a decent lesbian flick had hit the screen. Sadly I did not see the end of the film....I could not stand the boredom or the irritation that Helen Lesnick was causing any more! Do yourself a favour....hire it before you buy it!",1088380800,,516,4.681318681318682

3421311,2,B00009VU27,"I was totally disappointed by this movie.  Although there were some parts that made me laugh, the majority of the movie was a big letdown.  I found the acting and the dialogue amateurish and totally unbelievable.  This is one that I should have rented before I bought it.  Well, live and learn.  I wish I could give Ms. Lesnick a big thumbs up for this because there is a great need for good lesbian movies.  However, this just isn't one.  Maybe next time.",1086825600,,456,4.421686746987952
3421312,1,B00009VU27,"I rented this movie a few weeks ago because it was a gay movie I hadn't seen before, or heard of.  Then I realized why I hadn't heard of it or seen it before.  What sounded like a great premise turned into the longest 100 minutes of my life.  I have nothing against movies and actors that ""break the fourth wall"" and talk to the camera, but when the first line of the movie is, ""this is a gay movie, and there will be gay and lesbians characters--but not at the same time--so if you're in the wrong theatre I'll give you a chance to leave"" and then there's actually a thirty second break in dialoge?  Too much.  I didn't care about the characters.  There are movies that exemplify the message of ""accept your kids"" and ""follow your heart and don't dwell on the past"" that are a lot better than this one.",1086652800,,803,4.215686274509804
3421313,1,B00009VU27,"This film both blew and sucked! I, like many others I'm sure, expected so much more from this film.

It's important for Lesbians to be represented via Lesbian artists. Likewise, the more flooded the market and industry becomes with Lesbian films the more mainstream, and hopefully better quality, films we will have to enjoy. However, just because it is a ""Lesbian film"" does not mean that we must automatically and blindly declare it a masterpiece.

The acting in this film is, sadly, mediocre; the writing is flat and clich. Unfortunately, you really just keep watching because you think that it simply must get better, yet, it fails to do so in so many ways.

And, I'm sorry, but it is difficult to believe that the only two attractive women in the movie would fight over the ""wannabe-butchesque-stud"" who really seems to flop in every aspect. This in an unfortunate and embarrassing vehicle for writer / director Helen Lesnick to play out her fantasies and try to score props in doing so. It's obvious that Lesnick has a small group of supporters, however, it is an injustice to the Lesbian viewing audience to build this film up to Academy Award status and expect them to turn a blind eye to the obvious fact that this film really stinks.

Let's face it...those who can, sometimes shouldn't.",1086393600,,1296,4.772321428571429
3421314,5,B00009VU27,"Hey, Just got over reading the reviews to this movie...Wow, people either loved it or well did not care for it...But one thing I noticed common in all the reviews was passion...this movie really evoked emotion, which I think makes any movie a success, as I am tried of shallow flicks with no plot or talent.
I saw this movie about 2 years ago in a film festival, it won the audience award which I think is a great compliment..Now do not get me wrong this is a lower budget flick, rough around the edges, it isn't a film with a lot of financial backing like Kissing Jessica Stein or High Art...But the story is so good and the writing even better you forget the budget...These are some talented filmakers more so because they made a film for less and made it feel like more...
I liked the actresses, and there are some priceless scenes such as  the ex, the current gf, and the main character who is torn between the two...no movie has shown a love triangle any better represented than in this one scene no matter high the budget ( and that is an honest view) and there other priceless gems, inlaws, love scenes etc... This really will grow on you and become a favorite DVD in your library..
First time filmakers with an effort beyond their experience who capture the lesbian experience with humor, drama , and sex appeal...
I recommend this film highly, I think it is a great addition to gay cinema and a turning point to tell filmakers give us a quality story and you will have an audience..
Hope to see another film this good soon...(read something about a new Erotic drama coming out this spring in an article about lesbian cinema in Curve Mag...director of A Family Affair wrote it and is just directing, not acting this time, and somewhat HEAVY erotic content....hmmm think that should be a winner :) called escapable? or inescapable?...look it up do not know more than that
anyway see A Family Affair I give it 5 stars..",1076803200,,1925,4.5
3421315,5,B00009VU27,"Just got back from a trip at Olivia...someone told me about this film...rented it last night!!!
This is a great movie, it is about love, and ex's and new girls and old girls and how we get together and fall apart. Temptation, love, second guessing ourselves, everything we all know now on film.
It is well done, a great ensemble cast of talented girls who are really nice to look at, I just loved this film.",1076630400,,407,4.368421052631579
3421316,5,B00009VU27,"I saw this film a year ago in the movie theater...guess it had a limited release...so I heard it was selling so I hooked up to Amazon...read the reviews ...anyway...what did I think of this film....
It is good because there is talent here...not some banal film like Go Fish (awful) or Bar Girls (awful) or Two Girls in Love (A teen movie that should have been an afterschool special...)
A Family Affair is well written and really captures the lesbian drama of romance and understand the comedy of our lives...we can laugh at ourselves...the actors are talented the writing is great...some sexy girls in this one...and the lead who is the director knows how to play off her cast...Actually got interested in this film after reading an article in Curve Magazine...and read about director...she has been in mainstream film and stage and wanted a film for our genre as she is one of us...she was 37 when film was made so I think that speaks for itself she is experienced and understands love and heartache we all go through...yet she is young enough to attract a hip audience, I'm 26, I liked it...it is like a romantic comedy that teaches us about our own drama through laughter and a real hot sex scene ( a plus)
Go see it this one is a keeper ordered mine already...",1076630400,,1265,4.552631578947368

This is a 5 star film, low budget BIG talents, it should be in your dvd player right now...you'll take it out on a rainy day or on a date night....
This is what we lesbians need a romantic comedy where we can see ourselves represented in the film...two hours of bliss...anyone who thinks differently must not like anything..this is an easy to love film",1076544000,,528,4.627659574468085
3421319,5,B00009VU27,"This is the kind of movie I have been waiting for someone to create. It is sophisticated, sexy, funny, well written, great acting, actresses who I enjoy and hope I see again....it is the tale of the old cliche torn between two lovers but not done the old way...there are so many unique cinema treats, not just cause it is gay, but because these are talented filmakers. The director is able to mesh these characters together so as an audience we truly are interested in them, if you can not relate to one of these characters or what they are going through then you need to get out more....a must for every lesbian to see and a must for people who think we are different...because we have more in commom when it comes to human emotion then we have that is different...accept we are more enjoyable to watch...
See this film or you will be missing one of the best lesbian films on DVD or video today...I looked around, Amazon has a great price...but this film is selling in the top ten lesbian flicks since it came out....at least that is what I read in a magazine...saw it at a friends home this past week...I was the last to know...but it was worth the wait...if you know about this film you heard how great it is...if this is all new to you then what a fantastic surprise you are about to have....see it and fall in love with the film!",1076544000,,1334,4.34

I hope this company makes more films...this film leaves me wanting more from this director!!!!
BRAVO!!!",1076544000,,423,4.64

I am passionate about this film as a student I appreciate the filmaking and the script writing it deserves a bigger budget....
The director captures the emotions and personalities of these characters and I hope there are more movies in her future...
A Family Affair is that lesbian movie that will be remembered for groundbreaking style....no more films that look low biudget or scripts that make you want to scream NOOOOOOO!
This film is so well done you want to reach out and hug the cast and thank them for a film you will truly love...true it is low budget but what lesbian genre gets big budgets especially new directors...this is a filmaker that the gay community will welcome she sees us and hears us and understands we are no different than anyone else...other than who we choose to love...I wish I could give more than 5 stars this filmaker deserves the entire night sky!",1076544000,,978,4.691860465116279

The premise was good, but the actors couldn't act, the director couldn't direct, and the dubbing reminded me of watching the old Godzilla movies on Saturday mornings.  Everyone is so supportive, except the mother-in-law.  The father doesn't speak through the entire movie except to impart the greatest words of wisdom to Rachel near the end and clear up the mess she's made for herself in 10 minutes.  Typical, cliche, and BORING!",1075075200,,463,4.974025974025974
3421324,1,B00009VU27,"Yeah, this was one of the worst lesbian films I have seen. The only good actors were the REAL actors. The star over acted and still didn't put any emotion into her performance. Which is sad since she was the one who wrote the lines! The fiance was way too cutsey (and was that a wig she had on or what?) and unbelievable. The loving couple barely touched eachother and were horribly stilted in their conversations. And we were supposed to believe they had been living together for over a year?
The only believable and entertaining scenes were the ones with the parents or the ex-girlfriend which was played by the only eye candy in the whole movie, Michele Green. I could believe that she would get off on making this old chick chase her around.
The humor was tried for so hard that it fell flat. I love sarcastic humor but this was not it. It was a bunch of horribly cliched lines that were not delivered at all well. And some how the lead characters gay friends all delivered their lines in the exact same tone and cadence.
On to some technical issues. The sound was horrid. They must have had at least three different sound guys all working with different equipment. There were scenes that made you think your ears were popping - sometimes their voices were muddled, sometimes not. Incredibly annoying!
Now I am a huge supporter of lesbian films. I know that we do not have the budgets to make ""so called"" blockbusters but come on! We don't have to all love it just because there is so little out there! Saying that it was ""the best lesbian film this year"" is like saying a dead dandylion is the best flower on a glacier. Watch ""The Incredibly True Story of Two Girls in Love"" (catch one of the stars, Laurel Hollowman in The L Word)for real lesbian cinema. It's funny and entertaining. And the director was able to find real talent. Hell, I could find better talent in a high school drama class than what was in ""A Family Affair"".
Short and Sweet: Buy it if you must support the genre but please don't lead others to think that it was actually good. Even better: check out [...] to find out where the lesbian movies are playing and support them in the theaters. Now that will help our movies get better!",1073606400,,2207,4.438423645320197

I was not impressed with this movie.  The characters seemed rather bland and you could tell the actors just memorized their lines without putting any life into it at all.
The story was okay, but not very interesting. I was just waiting for it to end.
I'm not sure why it got good reviews on here, but that's what made me want to see it.  Now I want the 100 minutes back so I could do something more fun...like watch paint dry.",1072915200,,461,4.2272727272727275

Was it as good as people said it was? Did the film festivals that named it best picture (on the cover) make the right choice? Was a high Amazon rating correct? The answer is:
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!!!!!! (hey and I do not say yes easily:) A Family Affair is finally a lesbian film that knows something about script writing and acting. This was a hilarious film combined with some ultra sexy actresses (who could act) and a story that had you wishing the film was three hours so you spend more time with the characters. You won't see those dreaded stereotypes or dull angst ridden girls or coming out issues...These girls have arrived and you are lucky get to enter their lives for two hours. The story is a well done take on a love torn girl, making her mind up between ex and current gf and learning about herself in the process. This is a fabulous film. The dinner scene of the girlfriends is a highlight. And if you read lesbian mags, like Curve, Girlfriends, you'll know this filmaking group that made A Family Affair has a new film coming out next year!!!

Understand this is a low budget film compared to what is in your local multi plex, but the films script and acting shines, and shines brightly. This is a film about the romantic webs we weave and the sexy and sometimes comic conclusions of our acts. The story about a girl torn between two lovers is classic. And done so well it is refreshing. This is not like the gay films of the past, there is no ""finding oneself"" or dialogue that makes you want to scream ""shut up already, and do something"" A Family Affair is a treat,it is a film that talks on our level, no stereotypes just believable characters. All lesbians should see it just to be able to look at the screen and find yourself in one or more of the characters. I read in Curve the writer/director, Ms. Lesnick is coming out with a new film in 2004, an erotic drama...Can't Wait!!",1071014400,,1009,4.343915343915344

I love the characters of Christine and Reggie, the girls fighting over the affections of Rachel...Well honestly, I'd let those two fight over me any day. I especially like the dialogue between these two during the dinner scene, priceless.

Finally that has all changed. A Family Affair is a great independent movie. It is a lesbian film that anyone can enjoy. It is well written, and has quality actors. The story line is one everyone can relate too who has ever been in love or torn between two girls. It has a requisite sex scene that is not only well shot but, lets just say a very good date movie.
Can't wait to see the next film due out in 2004, read about it in Curve Magazine, an Erotic Drama, INESCAPABLE - Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1070236800,,758,4.460431654676259

Though obviusly lower budget than Hollywood productions the characters and story make you overlook their obvious budget contraints ( common to most Indies but uncommon that this film is not harmed by cost)
It is a tale about the clash of new love and the old love that wants you back, and the comedy, sex, and events that surround it..This is a movie that should be seen and seen again...I have seen it twice and the second viewing was better than the first",1070236800,,635,4.389830508474576

I know this movie had its definite awkward moments, such as the beginning monologue directly spoken to the camera, but after I kept my mind open about it and continued to watch, it grew on me. Lesnick has some very witty lines, and she did a decent job acting, too. Too bad we couldn't see more of Michelle Green, as well. But I was very impressed with Erica Shaffer who played ""Christine."" I think her honest and sincere charaterization is what made the movie. But one question for the director...why was ""Christine"" wearing a horrible wig half the time??
So, overall, I'd say check out this movie. Favorite part/line of the movie: ""This didn't happen in Mexico.""  Curious? Then you have to check it out. :)",1070150400,,870,4.612903225806452

I saw it and I can say they were all right! A Family Affair is a well done film that has a quality script, and fine talent. It is Romantic and extremely Funny...About a love triangle (the ex and the new girlfriend) you can not go wrong seeing this film...And I thank Amazon for offering their review system so you can read honest critiques..before you buy..

Rented this at Blockbuster as I am always looking for films on the mainstreams edge and really this story though lesbian, could be about any group...This is a well done movie from a first time director/writer (looked up the movie on the internet for more info). Sure it is not a Hollywood production but maybe that is why the film is so refreshing..It is a great movie whatever your orientation, likely lesbians will relate to it and enjoy it more, but I think this one should be equally shared.",1069718400,,773,4.608695652173913

We saw them all, Claire of the Moon, thumbs down for acting and the long wait to what ended being a dull ending, Desert Hearts: actually we liked it but left us wanting more, Lianna: an old Sayles film good but dated, but hit the emotional chords. And there were others that  t were so bad we couldn't believe they were made (can anyone say Go Fish or Sugar Sweet...aaaaahhh were dreadful)
Anyway, A Family Affair, was intelligent, funny, sexy and has a great script. Lesbian filmmakers should see this for an education. This film is destined to be a classic, especially in light of it covering marriage and the dating scene. We would give it more than 5 stars if we could.

I fell off the sofa laughing hysterically. This is a great two hours to spend watching a truly well crafted movie, and trust me lesbians love it, the couple were raving about it afterwards and I agree. There are CLASSIC scenes that everyone should see the lead actress having dinner with her ex who wants her back and her current girlfriend, a cat fight is brewing but in dialogue which is far better than any slapstick could be. The sex scenes, well like I said I am a gay guy but must say they were well done. Girls and Boys treat yourself to this one. A Family Affair is an affair to remember.

This is a great film with a fresh look. No longer do we have those dull badly acted lesbian movies where we watch for hours people telling us their philosophy about life or filled with angst, waiting for them to get to the point. No longer do we watch a film with actors who can't act or scripts that will put you to sleep. In other words A Family Affiar is different. This is a great movie that happens to be about lesbians! The actors can act, the script is funny, and the actresses are nice to look at for 2 hours. And of course there are sex scenes. So everyone gets what they want in this film. Truly this is a GREAT film. It is about relationships and choices, the kind we all deal with in our lives and it is the kind of film you will talk to your friends about long after the film is over.
I like this film so much I went to the web site of the movie for those interested. Anyway at the site I learned they are making a film with an erotic edge for lesbians!!!! Finally a company that understands what we want are great films and ones that interest us in every form.
Anyway see this film, it will be a treat. A Family Affair is a not to be missed lesbian cinematic treat!",1069113600,,1312,4.030651340996169

A Family Affair is the best lesbian film I have viewed in recent years. The lesbian community finally has a well written, funny and accurate portrayl of our love lives funny, dramatic and well not much different than our straight counterparts. It is time people got to see we are not so different just because of who we choose to love. This is a film every lesbian let alone person needs to see. You will likely see yourself in it in one of the well developed characters. The story is about a girl torn between two girls the new love and the old love. With a great cast and sexy actresses this film should not be missed. You will want to see this one over and over again and share it with everyone you know. Everyone I know who saw this film is literally in love with it. Here in Miami it is hard to find this film due to it selling out, I had to buy it on Amazon :)

All of a sudden Rachel's world turns upside down as she must face her fears of commitment. To make matters worse her New York ex-girlfriend makes an unexpected appearance before the wedding to lure Rachel back to the Big Apple.
This film is fresh and is full of fun and humor that any lesbian could relate to (i.e., jokes about U-Haul dating). The acting is good and the screenplay is realistic. A FAMILY AFFAIR is a testament that the quality of lesbian films has greatly approved over recent years. Kudos!

I bought this movie when it first came out based on all the good reviews at the time and the misleading film festival ""winner"" labels on the cover. (I can't imagine what the competition was like if this was the ""best"").
I can't believe that all the glowing reviews are talking about this movie; they were either paid or closely connected to the movie.  It's a bit suspect when the percentage of people that hate it is as close to the same as those that love it, there is no middle ground for this movie.
The movie is slow, the acting is BAD especially by the lead character, who is stiff and unconvincing and the sound quality is inconsistent. The lead actress is much older than ""36"" and looks more like the mother, instead of the girlfriend, a MAJOR distraction throughout the film. To believe that the two other women in the film would fight over her is ridiculous; it's more likely that they would run off with each other.

I try to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, especially lesbian movies, but this one is bad. Spend your money somewhere else. If you have to see it, borrow it! I'm sure there are a few lesbians out there with a copy they wouldn't miss.",1290643200,,1414,4.332075471698113

Erica Shaffer and several of the other actors did a nice job and I enjoyed their work in this film.  Mz Lesnick's lack of acting ability as the lead character caused this ship to sink.,1230768000,,353,4.4
8271157,1,B00009VU27,"Writer/director/actress Helen Lesnick tries to write, direct and actor in this film. She  wears too many hats in this film.

Lesnick plays Rachel, a woman who escapes NYC after a bad break-up with a former girlfriend Reggie (In one of the best preformances in the film, Michele Greene).Lesnick  mis-casted herself in her role. This mis-casting is the first nail in the coffin of this comedy

She goes to stay with her hip jewish California mother (Mayberry RFD""s Arlene Golonka) who hooks her a blind date with Christine (Erica Shaffer).

In a way, this film is a paradox of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I should say it gets one star due to its glibness of the script. However, without being lurid and oversexual, it mimimalized an idyllical Lesbian relationship with a lot of wit. I will say the film is well shot by director of photography Jim Orr, it is just that the acting is SOOOO BAD!

With Arlene Golonka and Barbara (Bunny from the old Gomer Pyle TV show) Stuart as the mothers, Their performances seems to overplay itself in this film . As I said before, L.A.  Law's Michele Greene seems to overshine the script and her role..you almost wish the film was about her alone!

Now other than Lesnick failure as an actress, Stand-up comic Suzanne Westenhoefer tries acting AND DOES IT BADLY..SUZY, stay a stand up comic PLEASE! and lets not get started on the wooden two note acting performance of Erica Shaffer. Her blonde wig acts better than she does in this film.

The funny part is the audio commentary  of this film . Lesnick is filled with trivia, if only the film deserved this commentary...IT DOESNT!

This film belong in the oblivion of any vidio library. If you can get this for a dollar, you paid too much!

8271158,2,B00009VU27,"Pretty boring film. The movie is about New Yorker Rachel (Lesnick) who moved to California to get away from her ex-girlfriend, Reggie. Rachel meets Christine, they fall in love, the are going to get married and Reggie comes to get Rachel back.

First of all, the casting of Lesnick was a great mistake in the movie. She is unlikable, unable to deliver an emotional performance (honestly, a piece of metal can muster more affection and emotion that she can), and just the wrong person for the role. She was supposed to be playing someone in her early 30s; but instead, she looks much older - her mother looks just a few couple of years older. Rachel came across as flimsy, neurotic and not the greatest catch.

On the other hand, Christine was very likable (and pretty much reminiscent of Charlotte in Sex and the City, maybe a bit too much). Reggie was actually the best character in the movie; she was aggressive, assertive, and smart. I actually wished that Christine would get together with Reggie. It would have certainly made it more interesting. Lesnick tried to cover too many issues in this movie and they were only superficially explored.

(SPOILER) Another thing that went into the movie was Rachel's deep rooted childhood trauma of losing a sister. It came to late and too superficial. The movie, and the story, seemed to contrived and too ""put together"" that it just doesn't fit. The other people in this movie could barely act, and the dialogue was delivered as if on queue.

Yes, it has  its low-budget problems, but it also has enough (dare I say it?) spiritual maturity to give it a groundedness that I don't see often in the genre. Very few movies take spiritual conversion seriously, much less attempt to portray that mystery on film. This story  manages to avoid the melodrama usually associated with conversion, and instead treats the experience with a plausible, convincing authenticity. The filmmakers are beginners, and it shows, but they deal with ancient issues of the human heart, and I'm so glad.",1191456000,,570,4.989473684210527
