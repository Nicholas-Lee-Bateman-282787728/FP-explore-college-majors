  I must have got 50 DVDs in the past few years, checking them out from the library, buying them at a walk-in store, renting from a ""family"" video store, and I bought 11 single DVDs and two boxed sets, and still counting... from Amazon.com. One thing that was conspicuously absent during all this time was a DVD that I wanted to see over and over again in its entirety, until now.
  Playboy Strip: Sexy Showgirls and Dirty Dancers is the first and only DVD so far that I've wanted to look at in its entirety time after time.
  Right from the get-go you can tell that this is something special.
  The DVD starts with fantastic music and giving us glimpses of a number of strippers performing on stage, then becomes a series of unrelated scenes. Before each scene the woman or women involved look into the camera and give us a few brief comments on what we're about to see.
  The first scene is a reenactment of a woman who goes to a strip club with her boyfriend, and he doesn't know that she works there. After a few moments she leaves her boyfriend at the table and gets up to strip on the stage, and her boyfriend is surprised and amused.
  Next, we have a blond giving us thoughts on stripping and ending with ""...and who knows what will happen.""
  The video that follows is a masterpiece as it starts with a guy sitting alone in a hotel room smoking a cigarette. He had apparently already made arrangements for an ""escort"" to meet him there. We see the beautiful blond, dressed in a stunning, black evening gown, walking down the hallway and stopping at the Presidential Suite.
She enters and does a sexy strip for him, while he is still sitting in his chair, still smoking his cigarette.
The expression(s) on the guy's face is a real gem, as he certainly doesn't seem surprised that she is there and stripping for him. After a while she takes him by the hand, and they have sex in the bed.
  Let's skip to the last video...one of my favorites and also a masterpiece. A girl gets out of a taxi during a foggy (or smoke-machine-filled) night and walks down the sidewalk. A guy who was in a phone booth at the spot where she gets out of the taxi follows her, but he's not a purse snatcher or a rapist. He's a hunk, and he even can dance, as we soon will see. The girl hurriedly walks in her high heels down the sidewalk, occasionally trotting and looking back to see if anyone is following her, and she walks through a series of abandoned warehouses. Finally she ends up on a stage in one of the abandoned warehouses, and a bank of lights comes on in back of her, and she starts stripping. The mood music during her walking and the music during her stripping is fantastic. Moments later the hunk guy walks up to the stage and watches her with a smile on his face, and he gets up on stage, takes off his shirt and joins her in dancing as she is dancing and stripping.
  The person who directed these videos might've had experience in doing commercials, for bits and pieces of some of these scenes could be like bits and pieces of videos for commercials.
  I really loved the music all the way through this DVD, for it is realistic for what a girl would strip to on stage at a strip club.
  I was surprised that a lot of guys don't like dance movies or dance videos. I was going to play the DVD of ""Flashdance"" once where a group of guys were, and they booed! which surprised me. I love watching ""Dancing With The Stars"", the movie ""Dirty Dancing"" other movies with dancing, but if a person doesn't like watching dancing or dance movies, even if the ""dancing"" is stripping, then that person probably would not like Playboy Strip; Sexy Showgirls and Dirty Dancers.",1207267200,5,3814,4.372521246458923
