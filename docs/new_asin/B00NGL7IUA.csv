6650124,2,B00NGL7IUA,Not like the others!  Its like  the writers are trying to scare kids or something.  Might as well watch monster house!  It was better before when we got to anticipate how the show would introduce memorable characters.  Other than the napoleon toad there really didn't seem to be those elements which usually make the show fun.,1427241600,2,326,4.75

6650126,1,B00NGL7IUA,"Awful!! I probably love this show more than my kids but this dvd sucked! It was a pure homage to teen horror flicks which was fun at first but grew quickly tiresome. No fav bad guys like shredder, karai, etc, appear! It better improve on the next dvd!",1426896000,,251,4.25

6650129,4,B00NGL7IUA,"While this is not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that I remember it is one my kids like and I don't mind them watching.  Yes they have weapons but they turtles who only use their weapons for bad guys, or actually creatures.  This set features new creatures and mutants. There are seven episodes on this DVD that have previously aired on television but its nice to have them all on one DVD. This is over 150 minutes of TMNT action!",1425686400,4,432,4.3875

6650145,5,B00NGL7IUA,"My grandson and I love these dvd's! We have them all. I highly recommend the Nickelodeon series!

The graphics are great... So real looking in a very creative way. The scripts are well written so as to keep the attention of adults.

Get them all! These DVD's will definitely make any Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan happy!",1450742400,,323,4.649122807017544

6650147,5,B00NGL7IUA,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves every episode. As an adult though, I would have to say this newest season was easily the worst. It wasn't as charming or funny as the first season.",1449532800,,198,3.975

6650151,3,B00NGL7IUA,"It is sad, but true.  This show is starting to really lose interest.  I do not know what has happened. Have the writers changed?  Maybe they don't know what to write about?  I almost hate half of the episodes on this set.  Here are the episodes (with only 1 minor spoiler):

Within the Woods - I didn't like this episode.  Really - turning Ralph into a pile of weed???

A Foot Too Big - This was a good episode and funny too!

Buried Secrets - I didn't like this episode.  The mutant in this episode was too creepy.  And, overall it was just a bad episode.

The Croaking - This wasn't too bad.

In Dream - This was a good episode.

Race with the Demon - I didn't like this episode.

Eyes of the Chimera - This episode was actually lame and I thought it was awful.

So there you have it.  Out of 6 episodes there were only 2 that I really liked.  And half of the episodes were just awful on this set.  I can definitely see that the fourth season of this show will be the last season.  I do have a little bit of advice.  If you love the concept of TMNT and if you haven't seen the 2003 version, I suggest checking it out.  The 2003 version was the most amazing version of the TMNT that they have ever made.  They still sell most of the DVDs here on Amazon.  Seasons 1 - 4 from the 2003 version are simply amazing.",1437004800,3,1311,4.03125
6650152,2,B00NGL7IUA,"This Is easily the worst set of episodes so far. My kids and I watch these on DVD so we can binge watch, and even my kids were asking why things had changed so much. While I originally thought a change of scenery to April's cabin would be a nice change up, it just doesn't work.

The first episode did give me some initial hope, with the homage to the original TMNT movie. Leo and Raph's positions reversed. But then they just turn into some awful monster scare of the week, with only Leo's recovery as the only progress in the main story. Even in the confines of what is ""technically"" a kid's cartoon, are we supposed to believe that the turtles are just not going to concerned with their missing master, and a occupation of an alien force of NY? I really hope the next group of episodes go back to the quality of Season 1 & 2.

*and as much as I love Seth Green, he could have tried to at least somewhat sound like Leo's original voice actor. Even the guy who took over midway through season 2 sounded better. The cop-out of his voice box was damaged by Shredder is just weak.",1436054400,2,1078,4.228155339805825
6650153,4,B00NGL7IUA,"I love this show but I'm a 33 year old mom. I bought it for my four year old son who loves tmnt. This show has gotten progressively ""scarier"". Granted it is probably directed at an older crowd of children. So some of the episodes we watch but we skip the really scary ones like when April's ""mom"" turns into an alien. Not a fan of Leo's voice change either.",1434326400,3,357,4.114285714285714

8678025,3,B00NGL7IUA,"Despite adapting a classic time of the TMNT's story over multiple other iterations I gotta say the Farmhouse arc in Nickelodeons series fell pretty flat. The best of it is the classic adaptions in the first episode of season 3 here as April runs down how each of the team is adapting to life on the farmhouse. Afterwards it becomes more padded out Monster of the week filler until they get ready to decide to go back to New York. I appriciate the new versions of the Mutant Frogs, and the nice cameo of the original April's voice actor from the 90's playing the current April's mother for an episode but the rest is just more ""WHA?!"" style mutants. A mutant plant monster doing it's best Friday the 13th cosplay, A car mutant, a chimera monster, Freddy Kruger Beavers, and....Bigfoot falling in love with Donnie....?! Not that the episodes aren't entertaining but it does make the show feel like they are spinning their wheels at the Farm too long.

Also this is where Leonardo got his Voice Actor switched from Jason Biggs to the current Seth Green, who I must admit fits Leo pretty well. And the show goes out of its way to add in a line why Leo sounds different in the first episode.

As such this first quarter of season 3 is one that while is necessary just feels drawn out too long. The DVD does come with some story boarded sequences for a few episodes but now real extras otherwise",1475107200,,1389,4.464566929133858
