8571364,5,B00BN3DZGY,"This blu-ray bundle contains four of the best sports-themed movies ever made.  ""Hoosiers"" represents basketball; ""Bull Durham"" represents baseball; ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" represent boxing.

These movies are about a lot more than just winning a game; these characters are are struggling not just with sports, but with life.  ""Rocky"" is my personal favorite of the bunch - but each of the movies features an interesting story and great performances.

Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the four movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case.  As for why these four films and not others, it's simple: these four are all owned by MGM.  But there are many other films that I'd recommend if you want a complete sports collection on blu-ray... Field of Dreams, Rudy, Remember the Titans, Seabiscuit, and Chariots of Fire.

Here are the links to the individual releases (prices are always changing, so sometimes it might be cheaper to buy the films individually):
