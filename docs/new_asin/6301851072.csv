7816130,1,6301851072,"This is obviously a zealous attempt to create a feature film despite a nearly total lack of production values, specially as related to sound quality, the work's dialogue being drowned in most scenes, the outdoor shooting by traffic noise and indoor settings by D.J. chosen woefully poor recordings, themselves incoherent, with only moralizing portions of the script being clearly audible.  Mike Rogen (Eric Burner), a bail estimation interviewer assigned to Brooklyn's 77th Precinct, is a law student attempting to learn his future vocation from the bottom as well as earn his living, when a female automobile thief, Theo (Christine Moore) is delivered to his desk.  She ostensibly responds to the budding counselor's expressed idealism by urging a romantic relationship upon Mike who has no knowledge of her felonious activities, nor is he suspicious concerning the actual nature of her recent arrest.  His fashionable social conscience and career plans become unsettled when Theo reveals that she is in fact a car thief and daughter of another, but when her ""pimp"", who regularly collects an allotment from her larceny, physically foists himself upon her, she violently resists and, as a consequence, the lovers find themselves involved in potentially more dire criminal activity.  A throng of bit and daily players, along with extras, are employed for short scenes depicting the wide range of peculiar individuals who find temporary lodging in New York City's jails, but foolish camera gimmickry and the mentioned dreadful sound reproduction, not at all improved by unskillful post-production efforts, make of the film a task to watch, its plot elements largely incomprehensible until its meaningless ending, due to the profound lack of intelligibility supplied by the sound track.",1140307200,,1784,5.406474820143885
