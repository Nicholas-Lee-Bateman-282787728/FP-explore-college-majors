8496106,5,B006BGH366,"Fascinating program featuring deep sea hunter, Mike Hatcher, who is in search of ancient treasure at the bottom of the South China sea. Mike and his crew aboard 'The Restless M', scour the South China sea for antiquities from the ship wreck of the Tek-Sing, which sank in 1819. Will they find any treasure beneath these deep, treacherous waters?

Mike investigates other ship wrecks which took place in the 18th-19th centuries. Captain James Pearl, aboard 'The Indiana' in 1822, transported thousands of chests of opium to China. When Captain Pearl's ship sank, his cargo was bursting with chests of Chinese silver, which were payments made for the opium. Those chests of silver may still lie beneath these waters.

Will Mike and his crew come back flush with bounty, or will their entire expedition to these waters be a bust?",1465084800,,826,4.9352517985611515

8496112,5,B006BGH366,"Very interesting documentary on a huge junk that sank in the South China Sea. Mixes dive and recovery videos, conservation footage, and follows the historian who dig the leg work in the library which allowed the identity of the junk to be confirmed. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys wreck diving and nautical history.",1356307200,3,342,4.813559322033898
