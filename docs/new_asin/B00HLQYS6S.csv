6167515,1,B00HLQYS6S,"Wow!!!! What a total waste of time and what garbage! This movie was so messy it was ridiculous. First off you have several different people who are staying in this motel in West Hollywood for various reasons. Every single character was laughable and nuts especially the straight couple who come and stay and after one evening the wife wakes up the following morning to find out that somehow she magically grew a very large penis and by the end of there trip it magically disappears!!????? Huh????? Are you kidding me with this? Than yet a young gay couple who are having in and outs in the relationship where one who has a huge movie fascination dreams of a guy who comes out of the TV into the ""real"" world and has dinner with him and than proceeds to be shown on how to ""hook up"" and than proceeds to put make up on and a wig!! Sounds ridiculous doesn't it as Im not making this thing up. Even the movie itself was shot badly. Even parts of the movie went from color to black and white and the cuts and editing was horrible.",1425513600,,1026,4.321243523316062
6167516,5,B00HLQYS6S,"I really enjoyed this film.

6167517,1,B00HLQYS6S,"This  would have to be one of the  worst  gay films of  this or any other year. This very short film runs  just  78 minutes. A group of people  (mostly not gay) are  guests at  a motel. They relate their  inane stories  that you could not give a damn about. The gay guys are  very good looking but the  straights and lesbians  are not. What sort of clichd casting is this? If ever there was a group of losers that  no one would care about, this film has them all .. There is a stupid  scene of a  straight  female  suddenly  growing an instant penis which  later  disappears . Did a  two year old write this rubbish?

6167534,4,B00HLQYS6S,"This is one strange movie, let me tell you. I have to give Riddlehoover credit, he makes an interesting script and picks good actors for the roles. But this is one strange movie. A guilt-ridden man checks into his motel room only to find that the previous tenant is still in residence and refusing to leave. A lesbian finds that after two years of being put up in a motel room, her lover still keeps promising to leave her husband, but keeps leaving her alone. A character in a movie decides he wants to live a real life and comes off the screen and has the occupant help him learn how. Said occupant, by the way, is supposed to be on vacation with his partner. who keeps leaving him alone to go party. Finally, a married couple finds a new surprise enters their marriage to complicate their lives. The said husband, by the way is an excellent actor. This movie has so many strained relationship that I thought it was a Tyler Perry piece, but , no, the actors are all white...I checked. I don't know what to tell you. Either you will enjoy this movie, with a morbid curiosity reserved for car accidents, or you will hate it.

The jokes are incredibly funny and each of the cast members are incredible actors. It plays out with the zaniness of a Marx Brothers pic especially with the old-time background music. The woman that plays Isabella reminds me of the great Kaye Ballard. Her interminably grumpy husband, Ray plays out to her as a literally straight man. the gay couples are all adorable. Cesar d 'La Torres is a hot Latin as well as the cute actor who played Victor. I will not go through the entire cast roles but take my word for it.

6167575,2,B00HLQYS6S,"""West Hollywood Motel"" openly acknowledges how bad it is throughout its god awful narration. The film never holds your attention because none of the characters become likable, even as it becomes a farce. Its purpose seems to only mimic more Woody Allen's jazz score and keep Matt Riddlehoover employed and, as usual, there is bad sound and a poor attempt to make the photography look like a film reel.

6167599,4,B00HLQYS6S,"I didn't think this movie was bad at all. I thought the fake scratchy film-thing was a bit much, only because it went on for the DURATION of the movie. It wasn't varied enough to sustain it (like, say, in ""Grindhouse""). I'd definitely say the directorial, editorial, and musical effort it took to turn this thing into a 60's foreign film-slash-Woody Allen-ripoff is more noteworthy than the script, itself. I was a fan of ""Scenes from a Gay Marriage"" and its sequel, so I'm a little predisposed to like Matt Riddlehoover's scripts. But I thought this film seemed rushed, and the genius (as it were) was spread REALLY thin, across way too much. Also, I know this is a moot point in a film called ""West Hollywood Motel,"" but the locations had NO atmosphere. It's a low-budget movie about a crappy motel, right? Sorry, but some art direction would've helped. There's a thin line between a movie about a crappy motel, and a movie that looks like it was shot in a crappy motel. And also, I'm getting a little sick of Riddlehoover's tense, you-did-something-wrong-and-it's-stressing-me-out delivery in all his movies. But, as my star rating would indicate, I liked it.

6167623,4,B00HLQYS6S,"A fun, and enjoyable film.  West Hollywood Motel, is funny, and easy to watch.  Each vignette is unique and interesting.  No academy nominations here but the acting is good, and I liked all of the characters.  My favorite actor is the wife, that is dealing with an interesting sexual reversal twist in her marriage. This happens when she suddenly, and mystically experiences a miraculous change in her body.  She is a very talented actress with great comical timing.  She reminds me very much of actress, comedienne Kaye Ballard.  It is difficult to hold your actors back from going over the top in such a fable.  I applaud Matt Riddlehoover as a director, he brought out interesting, believable, and funny performances from every actor. The dialogue was also very good.  Not the greatest story ever told, but most of the characters experience a unique, and interesting arc, that develops a positive change in most of the characters.  I promise you, the story will hold your interest. The situations will make you laugh, but also make you think.  Mostly, just expect to have an interesting, and entertaining time.  All the actors are beautiful, talented, and sexy.  I appreciate, and thank you for that too, Mr. Casting Director.  I recommend it for a good, enjoyable time, for just about everyone.  West Hollywood Motel, Classic Entertainment.",1427673600,5,1344,4.990990990990991
6167624,3,B00HLQYS6S,"The characters were amusing and the dialogue was not painful to listen to.  The two lovers were not well fleshed out but given the time and budgetary constraints it was understandable.  I enjoyed the wife, she was probably the best character both in term of an acting performance as well as dialogue.  The simple fact is this is worth a view.  It is not something you will want ot view more than once but the fact is it is a fun watch and you will not feel cheated when it ends.",1427587200,3,478,4.21978021978022

6167635,1,B00HLQYS6S,"I was willing to give the movie a chance, despite the medeocre acting, stereotypical casting, and unoriginal character development. When the movie started spouting ignorant quips about individuals with more unique sexual proclivities, I realized that it wasn't something I could support by watching it. Probably not a bad film overall if I had to guess, but LGBT-themed movies shouldn't segregate the community. Especially not for an ill-conceived laugh. Perhaps a re-write, recasting, and some better production value could make this concept a success, versus...whatever this is.",1426118400,,580,5.67816091954023

6167637,3,B00HLQYS6S,I enjoyed this but found it very uneven. All three stories were interesting. I only wish the farcical elements were introduced in all three cases at the same time and earlier in the film. The result was confusing and came out of the blue. Acting overall was inconsistent as well. Unless you are a HUGE fan of  gay and low budget independent film-- you'll most likely find this a waste of time.,1425945600,,393,4.458333333333333

fly-on-the-wall jaunt.

On a personal note, I particularly enjoyed the following:
(1) Day trip to the Hollywood Walk of Fame
(2) Bulk of action takes place within the motel walls
(3) Lesbian couple, and not in a straight male fantasy way
(4) Ongoing dynamic between the default lead characters, our first couple, the husband and wife

Delightful.",1517011200,,549,5.2272727272727275
