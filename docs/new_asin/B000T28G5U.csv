2892302,5,B000T28G5U,"This is the second collection of Deathnote episodes, one of the most compelling and amazing animes of all time. It tells the story of Light Yagami, an intelligent university student with a strong sense of justice who accidentally picks up a notebook owned by a God of Death. Slowly, he starts killing off criminals under the guise of Kira ('Killer'), becoming more and more like those who kills in the process. The storyline is incredibly amazing and faithful to the original mangas, while the artwork is absolutely perfect. And the music and English vocals are a perfect match as well. As a result, this is one of those animes that even people who normally don't like cartoons can get into.

On these four further episodes, the mind games between L. and Kira continue as each tries to ratchet up the intensity. Light (as Kira) has already forced L. to reveal his identity to the Japanese police, but L. is already beginning to suspect that Light IS Kira. Now Light has to deal with surveillance cameras and bugs in his room, as the task force, led by L. of course, spies on him. And worse yet, the fiance of Ray Pember (the FBI agent Kira killed) confronts Light with evidence that could reveal too much about Kira's powers. How can he get rid of her without knowing her real name? The plot continues to thicken with this DVD.

As an added bonus, the limited edition first run DVDs of the series each come boxed with a figure. This time around it's Light Yagami, holding his Deathnote, which adds to the appeal of splurging on the special edition.",1211587200,,1548,4.605072463768116
2892303,5,B000T28G5U,"The four episodes comprising the second volume of DEATH NOTE remain as gripping and intense as the first volume.  What I really enjoy about these episodes is that each one really tries to develop and expand the story.  Never does the story stand still or simply mark time.

Light becomes an increasingly dark character (a not unintentionally irony) as he begins to use the Death Note in more indiscriminate fashion.  He barely retains any regard for human life, instead more concerned with setting up a world that he can mold in his own fashion.  The most horrific episode is certainly the one where he strives desperately to learn the name of a woman on his trail so that he can use the Death Note to kill her.

Most animated series are based either on comedy or on action.  DEATH NOTE has to be the first one based primarily on reasoning.  Significant portions of each episode revolve around Light or L talking about their own strategies or tactics or figuring out those of their opponents.  I can think of another show that takes critical thinking so seriously.  I think this is at least part of its wide appeal.  It values the brain to a degree that few other shows do.",1210032000,,1173,4.564593301435407
2892304,5,B000T28G5U,"So this isn't as great as the first Disc...it still rocks.

The episode where Light tries to fathom the ex FBI agent's name is great.  These episodes are less action packed but no less intriguing than the previous.  I was wowed several times during these 4 episodes.

Verdict: still a five star: strong animation, characterization, and music.",1209340800,,342,4.947368421052632
2892305,5,B000T28G5U,"It was exactly what we expected. The ""extras"" on the DVD were very interesting also. My daughter and I are huge fans!",1206316800,,117,4.363636363636363
2892306,5,B000T28G5U,"First off I have to talk about the Light Figurne. What might put you off getting the Limited Editon Death Note vol 2 is the cost, although it's not much more than the one without the figurine some of you might not what to pay that little bit more; but trust me, it's worth it, theres a great feeling in knowing that there's only 1500 of something in the world and you own one.(So what I'm saying if you can try to get this before it's sold out, you might not get another chance)

With vol 1 you got a Ryuk figurine, in comparison the Light one is much smaller than Ryuk. Also, because his hand is sticking out the paint on his finger tips might be worn slightly in the packet. Other than that he's great.

This vol has episodes 5-8 and a lot happens in them. Light has to fend off the FBI agents. The team on the Kira case finaly meet L face to face and he's not quite what they thought he would be. And now not only does Light have a deal with L bugging his home, but someone may know something about ""Kira's"" power that could help L get that much closer to finding out who Kira really is. Worst of all poor Ryuk as to go without his loverly apples! But the best bit is the episode prevew on the last ep of the disk, making you want the next one all the more.

Extras: English voice actor intervies and recrding sessions-(this time it's L) If you're anything like me you won't like this bit as the actors have no clue what they are talking about, you think ""my god, if you want to know what happens next so badly read the manga""(and if you havn't read it yet eather you really should)

Japanese animation director and character designer interviw-
probably the strongist of the extras

Production art-

and Audio commentary-
but yet again the actors don't know what the hell they're talking about.

So, yeah you should get this, or if you don't want to spend the little extra on this get the one without the figurine, if that's still too much for you then just get the manga(all 12 vol's are out now)",1202515200,2,2000,4.219895287958115
2892307,5,B000T28G5U,"I began watching this series on Adult Swim (Cartoon Network).  I was instantly hooked.  I couldn't help notice how well thought out the storyline is.  It one of those series that is so elegantly put together, the story just draws you in.  When you feel the emotions experienced by the characters, you know it's good.  For those who think that all dubbed anime is terrible, you couldn't be more wrong.  VIZ, the production company, has completely redid each episode so the characters actually appear to be speaking English--this is not some crappy dub-over.  However, if you still insist on reading subtitles, you can always change the DVD options.  And of course, this isn't just for younger audiences.  This is one series you can't pass up!!!!",1201910400,2,744,4.888
2892308,4,B000T28G5U,"This volume is the one that really hooked me on the series.  The first dvd is more of a setup for the cat and mouse game between L and Light.  This volume dives more into the game that they play L trying to uncover any clues and Light trying to remain anonymous.  Episode 5 is amazing, really driving the story forward as well as episode 8.  Episode 6 and 7 unfortunately seem more filler and could have been condensed into one I think but the other episodes make up for it I think.  Rating only a 4 because of middle 2 episodes dragging the story out and the eyes on the Light figurine look a little weird, one is looking ahead while the other is looking to the right, doesn't seem right to me...",1197936000,4,697,4.1716417910447765
8207311,1,B000T28G5U,THIS IS NOT THE SECOND PART OF DEATH NOTE.  I thought I had found a great deal of the second part of DeathNote. No it's episode's 5-8 of the first half.  Luckily I didn't really lose money.  But I was not happy.,1500854400,,211,3.9761904761904763
8207312,4,B000T28G5U,great working condition but the case was a little messed up. I'm still happy with it though,1489795200,,91,4.411764705882353

8207318,5,B000T28G5U,"Limited Editions aren't always worth it but this one seems nice, The Light Figurine isn't too special but still nice. Glad it was cheap. Don't pay too much though, remember that the regular dvds are always cheaper usually around 3-5 dollars. It's up to you.",1366588800,,257,4.733333333333333
8207319,5,B000T28G5U,"Honestly, this is one of the best tv series ever simply because of the mental part of it.  There isn't so much action in the sense of people fighting.  It's all about the mental warfare.  This series will keep you guessing what is going to happen inbetween each episode and as you're watching the episode itself.  This is something that everybody and anybody should watch at least once through.

The Bad Part:  It technically ended with the resolution at the end of the first ""season"".  You can tell what part I'm talking about when you see it.  Then because the fans loved it so much and they pressured him, he went about making a second ""season"".  Think of it really being two books in the set.  The second set of episodes takes some episodes to really get along.  He had to take it slow to keep the human reactions in the show realistic as opposed to them ""magically"" figuring somthing out or slipping up.  So that's it's only real downside.

There is one other part I don't particularly care for, but I can't say because it's a spoiler.  If you enjoy the series, you'll know instantly what part I mean when you see it. ;)",1219536000,,1125,4.424390243902439
