I bought my copy on vhs about 10 years ago at the Pocono Blues Festival and haven't seen another copy since although believe me, I've looked. I can't wait to get a copy on dvd. Takes place in Bluesman John Jackson's back yard in Alexandria VA. He and his wife threw an annual Blues party for many years and this has many of the older Blues musicians (including Flora Molton, a musician who played many a street corner in DC) reminiscing about their careers and lives as well as performing and just having a fine time. Perfect example of the  southern house party tradition. Every true Blues fan should own this dvd. I own about 50 Blues videos and this is one of my very favorites.",1157587200,4,725,4.37037037037037
