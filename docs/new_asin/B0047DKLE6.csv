4284982,3,B0047DKLE6,"William Castle's first major directorial effort is a C effort from a guy who will spend his career making B movies.  The plot lumbers along for the first hour and then races to the finish line as Castle frantically ties up all the loose ends and gives us one of the most preposterous endings of an movie.  Great performance by Jim Backus who is truly creepy here folks....he is right up there with the kind of squirm in your seat performance like Jackie Early Haley in LITTLE CHILDREN.  Too bad that casting directors didn't see the potential here for Mr. Backus to take on more parts like this one; the scene with he and the blind girl as they emerge from their tryst is truly U N C OM F O R T A B L E.  For a film that advertised itself by offering $1000 to your loved ones (should you die of fright during the picture), there is not much here that is frightening but, then again, I have to tip my hat to Mr. Castle who always at least TRIED for greatness with each picture he made which is lot more than I can say about most movies made today.",1366243200,,1046,4.137931034482759
4284983,5,B0047DKLE6,"I have always loved William Castle films. And I still do. Absurd and very cheap but truly off the wall. And of course,great fun for fans of this stuff. Macabre is the one with,he played a nasty so many times,William Prince. And loveable, the voice of Mr Magoo. James Dean's well meaning father,Jim backus as a baddie. Plus a hundred thousand dollar insurance against a viewer dying of fright while watching. Highly unlikely. Tho' not as unlikely as anyone ever being able to collect. Not another 'The Tingler'but if you like this type of film. You'll really enjoy this one.",1366156800,3,573,4.74
4284984,3,B0047DKLE6,I saw this movie when I was 10 yrs old. I enjoyed watching it now. It was good for the year it was filmed in.,1353456000,4,109,3.4
4284985,4,B0047DKLE6,"...than meets the eye at first glance. It has been half a century since I first saw this movie. Watching it again for the first time in all those years made me realize what an impact it had on me way back when. Certain scenes just jumped right out at me as if I were still a child while I can now appreciate the rest of the film as only an adult can. The subject matter (a child being buried alive) would certainly be memorable and frightening to a child back in those innocent days of black & white three network TV. What struck me this time around is how well made MACABRE really is. It combines the look of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER small town America (the film was made in 1958) with the fog laden atmosphere and chiaroscuro lighting of the classic Universal horror films. Although Jacqueline Scott's performance is somewhat overheated and the script doesn't make a lot of sense in some places, the overall effectiveness is still pretty remarkable.

Director William Castle has never been given the credit that producer Willliam Castle has in the making of these films. This is the first Castle film that had a promtional gimmick. Each patron was guarenteed ""Fright Insurance"" from Lloyd's of London that promised to pay $1000 should they die of fright. Of course nobody did and the film made a small fortune and Castle was on his way. Despite the gimmick, MACABRE is extremely well made and tightly directed for maximum impact with a couple of genuine old school scares and a surprisingly serious low key performance from Jim Backus proving that there was more to him than just Mr Magoo and Thurston Howell III. Then there's the ending credits which are memorable to say the least. The Warner Archive made-on-demand DVD has an incredibly sharp black and white picture and, as usual, no extras but you don't really need any. For me, having the film available again is reward enough.",1352592000,12,1879,4.625748502994012
4284986,4,B0047DKLE6,"This film is a picture purfect William castle film. It has his style down completely. This is the earliest castle film I've seen so fare but I can see his  trademarked threw it.

4284989,3,B0047DKLE6,"Like another reviewer mentioned, I grew up reading and hearing about this movie for many years.  When the films of the great William Castle started finding their way to home video in the early 80's, Macabre was MIA.  I thoroughly enjoyed 13 Ghosts, House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler, to name some of the more popular titles.  But in my mind's eye, I could still see that wonderfully spooky movie poster (see the DVD cover), and wondered if I'd ever get a chance to see Macabre.

So was the wait worth it?  Well, for the most part, yes.  Remember, this is Castle at the beginning of his directing career.  Although he'd already started using gimmicks to lure patrons in the theater, he hadn't quite perfected the horror film.  Which just means that, although Macabre is very well-made, the pace may be too slow for modern viewers.

Warner Bros. should be commended for taking time to do a proper restoration, something they still seem reluctant to do with many films in their ""Made on Demand"" library.  If you like black & white horror and suspense films, the restored print used here is terrific.  The audio track is mono, but it's clear and uniform throughout the film.  And this is becoming a common complaint with these MOD releases, but there are NO extra features. . .not even chapter stops (although the viewer can skip ahead in 10 minute increments by simply pressing the chapter skip button on the remote).  It's a shame, too, because the film's original trailer is wonderful.  A disclaimer on the package states that the film, made on a DVD-R disc, may not play back on computer drives or DVD recorders.  I don't know about the recorder option, but I've got a Blu-ray player and 52"" screen, so I can't imagine ever playing a movie on my PC.

If you have fond memories of the film, or just a long-held curiosity like I did, this one's worth picking up.  The MOD program definitely needs some tweaking, but in the meantime it may be the only way to enjoy seemingly lost films like this one.",1297123200,13,2001,4.575842696629214
4284990,4,B0047DKLE6,"When I was a kid I used to buy a magazine called, ""Famous Monsters of Filmland."" I would see photographs from creepy movies and they would fire my imagination. I wanted to know what happened next. Well, now, millions of years later, I remember some of the titles and I buy them when they show up, like this one for instance. They don't always turn out as expected.

The story concerns a Doctor who is hated by the townsfolk because they blame him for the death of a young, blind woman. While he is out his housekeeper receives a telephone call saying his daughter, a child, has been kidnapped and buried alive and has air for about four to five hours. On hearing this the housekeeper faints. When the Doctor gets back he revives her and she tells him what's happened.

Now, these people would never get any Oscars for acting. The girl takes forever to tell the Doctor the details of the phone call. The first thing out of her mouth is not, ""Oh Doc, they,ve got your daughter and buried her alive somewhere."" No, she goes on about how the person asked her where the Doctor was and that she told the caller he was out, then the caller laughed and frightened her and blah, blah, blah. When the Doctor IS told his daughter is missing does he scream and panic like a normal person? No, he's very thoughtful, takes a shovel and he and the housekeeper drive what seems like a long way to a cemetery to look for freshly dug graves. They dig here and there but find nothing. Various people turn up and they have discussions with each of them...Remember now, there is a child buried alive in a coffin slowly suffocating...but the Doc has all the time in the world. He even attends another funeral, held at midnight. Well, I'm not telling you any more, you'll have to watch it yourselves. - It has great atmosphere, the graveyard has the overgrown tombs and the swirling mist, hands appearing from behind gravestones etc. and the end titles are unusual.

This film was directed by William Castle. Generally speaking I like his films, they are usually oddities. He had a gimmick for this one in that all members of the audience were insured for $1,000 if they died of fright while watching the movie. Ha, I'd like to see anyone collect on that one. For one thing how would they prove someone had died of fright? And, for another there is nothing in this movie that is that scary. Amusingly though the audience is asked at the start of the picture to look out for the person sitting next to them, to make sure they are ok.

Another thing to mention is that I have read that Warner Bros. are making their discs in their, Archive Collection, of which this is one, on demand. This seems to mean that this and the other discs in the series are not being released in the usual way but are manufactured  as people order them. The discs look different too, they are a purpley blue colour and look as if they have been burned on a computer. THEY ARE OFFICIAL RELEASES however, they are NOT pirates or copies. On the back cover a notice says, ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD video play only devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices including recorders and PC devices."" I tried it on my computer and it played ok. It's not region one encoded and should play in Britain with no problems. The black and white picture quality is superb, nice contrast, good, deep blacks and brilliant whites. Pity they've cropped it at top and bottom to make it widescreen. I wish they wouldn't do that to these old movies. At about 26 these Archive Collection series are pricey so, if they don't sell many these titles may be deleted.

All in all though, I enjoyed this, even with the rubbish acting - it WAS 1957 after all, and I like nostalgia.",1295827200,23,3726,4.424198250728863
4284991,3,B0047DKLE6,"William Castle's first directorial effort scared the pants off me when I first saw it. We've come a long way since then.

Castle always had his gimmicks, and his films were mostly satisfying. He's left a legacy of horror that is to be commended: House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, Homicidal, Mr. Sardonicus, Strait-Jacket, etc.

""Macabre"" hasn't survived the test of time, and it's suspense element has been decimated by subsequent films. Still, the DVD transfer isn't bad, and the story holds some interest. What was missing were the scares. Maybe this would be a good film to show kids on Hallowe'en. It's not offensive, and is certainly milder than most of what's on TV today. Mr. Castle certainly knows how to create suspense, and most of that comes from his regular use of Von Dexter's always satisfying and creepy music score.",1423526400,,833,4.859154929577465
4284992,3,B0047DKLE6,"The original, scary-looking movie poster must be another one of the gimmicks Mr. Castle is known for and is a big come-on for an underwhelming, and disappointing production from the maker of House on Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts, The Tingler and Mr. Sardonicus, (movies worth multiple, if not many viewings).  The creepy set design in some scenes was interesting, but was not put to best use or given enough screen time.  I thought Wm Prince, though a good supporting actor, was not a very charismatic lead, and was oddly balanced by the experiment of having Jim Backus play a brutish cop.  A few other supporting actors were underutilized, (such as Ellen Corby) or just plan bad (or badly directed?),  I noticed a lack of background music that was so effective in chillers like the Haunting (1963).  Wm Castle seems to be an uneven producer/director, with the best worth seeking out and the rest viewed once for the curiosity factor...you probably won't be bored, but you'll be wondering...what was he thinking?",1419552000,,1007,4.9

8418082,4,B0047DKLE6,"Macabre tells the tale of a small town doctor who gets a cryptic message telling him his small daughter has been kidnapped and buried alive. He has to find her before time (and her air!) runs out.

William Castle started as he meant to go on, with a low budget, yes, but also with the ability to direct and photograph what counts: tight dramatic scenes, stark lighting and shock effects. I am sure the audiences loved this when it first came out. It's pretty short and actually quite low on action, even tough it's central idea (death of a child by suffocation in a coffin) is quite nasty.

The acting is variable. Jacqueline Scott overacts rather as love-lorn nurse Polly, whereas William Prince tends to keep things fairly wooden as the tormented doctor. They are better supported by the rest of the cast, who all do great work, especially Ellen Corby who I love as the child's elderly nursemaid. Castle always seems to get quality actors for the small parts in his movies, even if the leads can be a bit flakey.

There's lots of acton set in a graveyard as the cast equip themselves with spades and torches to search for the missing child, and in a nice touch the film only covers a period of about 5 hours in time (a clock reminds of of this), although two fairly long flashback fill in some details of past intrigues. The film only really boats a handful of shocks, the notable one being some hilariously gruesome remains found inside a coffin, and a dead body found suddenly in a dark corner. Short enough and silly enough to be entertaining, it shows that William Castle knows how to make a movie.",1513382400,,1604,4.524137931034483
