1685080,4,B000062XEK,"This ""2"" pack includes 4 Firm workouts including ""Standing Legs"", ""Upper Body"", ""Tough Tape 2"" and ""5 Day Abs."" When I ordered this, I could not find a list of these titles. I would not have ordered this item if I had known that I was ordering 3 workouts that I already owned. As for the firm tapes, they are great workouts for the serious exerciser. They make you work for every minute you watch. You don't have to worry that you can't make it to the gym. They would probably be intimidating to the beginner but over time would be an accomplishment to complete. This ""2 Pack- really a 4"" pack is a great deal for anyone wishing to start the firm videos but they'll produce serious muscle toning/soreness from day one. Good burn!",1022025600,111,729,4.407407407407407
7957898,5,B000062XEK,"I started out using this set in VHS back in the late 80's  early 90's. When we finally switched to a DVD player I gave my tapes away and replaced them with ""Get Chisel'd"", ""Hi-Def Sculpt"", ""Dangerous Curves Ahead"", ""Hard Core Fusion"",  and ""Super Body Sculpt"".  I do love these workouts also, but I am really excited to add back into my daily routine my oldies. The workouts are refreshing and make you feel good..... But, I have been using the Firm workouts for well over 20 years! The compliments I receive on how great I look for my age (50 bring it on I'm not afraid)  But like everyone said in the other reviews they will kick your butt.... literally into shape! Thank you so much ""The Firm"". The workouts are addicting.",1468368000,,725,4.428571428571429
7957899,5,B000062XEK,"This may be an old workout dvd, but it is a real workout.  I have a lot of others but I always come back to this one..  After doing it I feel strong and I know my friends and family can see  how strong I look.",1401321600,,209,3.5
7957900,5,B000062XEK,"I've done The Firm workouts for years. I had this set on VHS if that tells you anything. If your looking to do strength training, build muscle, and burn more calories this is the ticket. You'll need several different sizes of dumbbells, and a box (step), and you're on your way to being tight, and tone. You'll get a great upper body, lower body, ab work all bundled into this one set of DVD's. They say results in 10 days, and they're not fibbing.",1365724800,,448,4.345238095238095
7957901,5,B000062XEK,"Originally (on VHS in the 80s-90s) the FIRM had TOTAL BODY workouts which were an hour+. They then came out with FIRM PARTS videos which were 'compiled' from the TOTAL videos but only the segments pertaining to the PART (ex: ABS). So if you wanted to just work a PART, you could do one of these compilation workouts to focus on that. Now with this DVD set, they took 4 PART videos which as a total creates a TOTAL BODY(abs/upper/lower, etc) workout but what it actually is are 4 FIRM:PARTS videos all on one DVD set. Fabulous if you own any of the 'parts' videos as this replaces 4 VHS tapes. I have 3 of the 4 on VHS so this is a great find for me! You might want to look into the Firm Classic TOTAL BODY workouts which are now on DVD if you are looking for 'uncut' but be aware that they are over an hour in length and cover ALL body parts including a warmup and cooldown. Best videos for literally 'changing' your body. They used to guarantee visible results in 10 workouts - true stuff. But that refers to the Total Body full 60+ minute workouts - not these targeted toning videos. Unless of course you can do all 4 of them for a total body workout...yikes!",1363564800,,1161,4.2342342342342345
7957902,1,B000062XEK,"This tape is bits and pieces from other FIRM workouts, kind of thrown together. My fault, should have read the reviews more carefully.",1296518400,,134,4.869565217391305
7957903,3,B000062XEK,One of the DVD boxes was broken during delivery. More protection is needed. The DVD itself is OK.,1288483200,,97,4.444444444444445
7957904,5,B000062XEK,"I have a special place in my heart for THE FIRM workouts. I've been doing them for many years. I'm in the process of replacing all my FIRM VHS tapes with DVDs so I can get back in my routine. I took a long break from them and it's time to get back at it. After all, I was in my best shape ever when doing these work outs on a regular basis.

I now go to the gym 3-5 days a week and recently did these workouts and was sore for 3+ days after. I knew I loved these for a reason. You work muscles you forgot you had!!! I strongly recommend you add THE FIRM to your workout.",1275696000,3,570,3.75
7957905,1,B000062XEK,"This video is almost gross, it keeps showing nude statues of men and it was done very poorly in the 80s, i did all 5 days of abs and felt nothing, save your money and buy a Biggest Loser product.",1262131200,,195,3.9
7957906,3,B000062XEK,"I bought this DVD to help me recover from ACL/knee surgery.  The workouts are tough and ,yes, a little choppy. At the end of a set there's an instructor to tell what's needed to prep for the next set.  A nice rest and good instuction except that I feel it's just a sneeky way to tie in several complations of videos that appear to be from the late 80's.  I'm an active athleate in martial arts and I found this 2-pack to be chalanging.  However, the arm workout seriously lacked in bicep attention. Also, curiously the people on the cover have little to do with the actual workouts other than to update the DVD.  Still, it's worth the money.",1036800000,2,641,4.352941176470588
