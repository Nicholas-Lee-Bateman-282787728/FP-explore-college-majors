8066110,2,B0009SBYOE,"Since I just came back from Sedona, I wanted to have something to remember how absolutely gorgeous the area is. The video does not do justice and there is just not enough information regarding vortexes.",1474329600,,202,4.8

8066112,4,B0009SBYOE,"This is a very enjoyable video representation of the Sedona area.  I've been there several times and miss it while I'm away, so this DVD helps me get my fix.  At times in the beginning it has a bit of a ""Chamber of Commerce"" tone to it, but the gorgeous aerial video makes up for it.

The last third of the video has little voice over and focuses on the incredible beauty of the area, set to an engaging soundtrack.  It would have been nice to have some graphics indicating where the shots were taken or what formations were being depicted, but otherwise this is a well done video.",1408147200,4,581,4.302752293577981

I want to go again! The footage is so beautiful. This DVD captures the essence of Sedona... the peacefulness, the natural beauty, and the very special feeling that you get when you're in Sedona. I've purchased/viewed a number of DVDs of Sedona, but found that this one is the best by far, that captures the essence of such a wonderous place!",1260057600,8,501,4.28421052631579
8066115,5,B0009SBYOE,"This DVD is a general overview of the Sedona area. It's worth a watch if you've been to Sedona, and if you haven't then watching it will make you want to go! The best thing about this is the amazing aerial footage covering all the different areas of Sedona from the more built-up areas to the stunning red rock canyons and rock formations. Makes a good gift! There are some clips from this DVD at [...]",1230076800,6,402,4.302631578947368
