7608170,4,B01ASMCMPU,"GOOD HIGH FANTASY

One of the genres anime never seem to get right is high fantasy. Berserk and Claymore don't count, since they are dark fantasy, Attack on Titan doesnt count because it is a typical zombie apocalypse with shonen characters, while Lodoss War that counts is as dry as the chamomile leaves we gathered last year for tea. Most others that claim to be high fantasy are more like slapstick comedies set in a pseudo-medieval setting, thus they do close to nothing when it comes to capturing that 2nd edition of Dungeons and Dragons I grew up with, back when everything are great because it was retro. And of course there are also light novel adaptations, which are complete garbage, regardless of what genre they deal with, high fantasy included.

So here comes this show to finally break this curse by capturing exactly the magic of what high fantasy is all about. A strong sense of adventure, really high stakes, cheesy dialogues, random enemy encounters, unexpected plot twists, emphasis on character fleshing out, and epic showdowns with dragons, gods, demons, or all of them at the same time.

BEATS THE SOURCE MATERIAL

Despite being based on a virtual card game, not only it doesnt feel like it promotes it by using its gameplay mechanics, but it also does not use cheap tactics like fan service, in order to simply sell, and doesnt even resort to an episodic structure, so it can be nothing more than an aimless adventure with pretty colors. You want more? There is a plot, and there is a finale, which is solid. You want even more than that? The protagonists are not beta males and sexualized lolis but dynamic men and women you can show respect for, since they don't constantly act like horny sluts.

This is not a lifeless adaptation, made solely to advertize a game. Studio Mappa did a splendid job in making it stand on its own, and at the same time being far superior to its source material. As much as I don't care about pretty colors, I cant deny the effort they put into the presentation. The attention to detail when it comes to backgrounds, character motions, and dynamic music, is enough to make even the dullest of episodes fun enough to watch.

GARBAGE SCRIPT

The worst part of the show is the script and I am not sure if that even matters in high fantasy, but lets pretend it does. From a critical standpoint its garbage, since just like most actual pen and paper role playing games, stuff happen because they need to happen at that particular moment, and not because there is a reasonable chain reaction of events that lead to them. If you dislike characters appearing out of nowhere, doing something, and then flying away without anyone being able to do the slightest thing about it, well, too bad, because Bahamut could have easily be called Teleportation, the Animated Series. It is completely chaotic in its story structure, so any strategy the characters have, means absolutely nothing. In other words, this is a show that lives and dies by the rule of cool. Trying to look for depth or underlying messages can only damage the experience. It is meant to be loud, flashy, shallow, exciting, and nothing more.

PURE FUN

If you stick to the action and adventure parts though, you won't be able to get enough of it, since it is made with such passion that it grabs you in seconds and doesnt let you go. Enjoy a cursed rogue with a tail, as he is chased around by a guy who wants to avenge the death of his father, while he escorts a half demon woman with the mentality of a little girl, through dungeons, and haunted forests, and stormy oceans, trying to get to hell and prevent the dragon of the apocalypse from awakening and wiping out everything, as gods and demons are fighting for supremacy all around them. Also, there is a talking duck.

IN CONCLUSION

If you are wondering why I sound so positive about it, when I keep bitching about the script being more important than entertainment, its because it avoids all the done to death anime stereotypes modern anime are full of. No schools, no sexualized sluts, no beta males. It stands out from almost everything else and the character chemistry helps to mesh everything together in a satisfying way. If that is not a good enough excuse for you, then see it this way: It is also the only good high fantasy anime ever made. And even if that is not enough, at least its very fun.",1480032000,6,4369,4.602827763496144

7608173,5,B01ASMCMPU,"FAVAROOOOO!!!!

This anime is a bit of a one-off, in the way it doesn't quite match most of the other fantasy series I've seen. The way I would explain the feeling the show gives you is something like that ""cool"" factor, like from Space Dandy, but set more in a fantasy world like GunXSword or Fractale.

The characters and voice-actors are really what drives the whole series, and the English dub is surprisingly on-point (I recommend it to English native speakers).

I won't describe the show in fear of ruining it for anyone, but I would definitely give this one the ""go ahead"" on purchasing. At the very least, it's a ""watch 2-3 times"" series for me, but not consecutively.

Hope to see more like this Funimation! And also, hurry up with the ""Your Name"" localization!!!",1474416000,9,773,4.661764705882353

7608175,5,B01ASMCMPU,One of the best anime I've seen in years. It has top-notch animation and music which compliment a complete and cohesive story. The packaging is fine and comes with the usual suite of DVD/Blu-ray extras.,1465171200,5,202,4.8
7608176,5,B01ASMCMPU,"One of my favorite animes i own, its very simple with looking very pretty and designed nicely (except for some strange looking 3D things). Story fits very well into the 12 episodes, it doesn't feel like other animes like its cut off or rushed, perfect amount of character development and action.

I can't say more without spoiling it so if you are at all an anime fan you must buy this",1464652800,3,385,4.422535211267606

7608179,4,B01ASMCMPU,"Long ago, the dragon Bahamut threatened to destroy the land, but was stopped by an alliance of humans, gods, and demons. He was then sealed and the key split in half, with one piece give to the gods and the other to the demons. Two thousand years later a strange woman steals the god's half of the key and the world teeters on the verge of chaos.

The story follows Favaro Leone, a bounty hunter and scoundrel , who after a night of drunken revelry, finds himself bound in a contract with a one winged demoness named Amira on a quest to find her beloved mother.

The characters in this show aren't very complex, but darn are they fun to watch. Favaro in particular was fun because he is so true to his scoundrel characterization, more so than I would expect from an anime. The setting is isn't too innovative, but it is so well done that you don't really care. I mean, theyve got gods, demons, and dragons - what more could you want?

One review of this show I read called it a Hollywood adventure movie, which I think is a great description of it. It is much more western feeling than most other anime. I was pretty surprised to find this show was based on a mobile game. It is certainly one of the best game adaptions I have seen.

There is already a sequel planned, called Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, and there is also a related show called Rage of Bahamut: Malaria Friends.",1459900800,7,1379,4.333333333333333

8748261,5,B01ASMCMPU,"The sleeper hit of 2014!! Based on a Card Battle Game on Android and iOS This anime follows Favaro an opportunistic bounty hunter who unwittingly makes a deal with a demon to take her to a land called Helhiem. Along the way they are enlisted to help keep the world destroying dragon Bahamut sealed in perpetual slumber. I'm not going into more detail than that because it is an anime you must watch to see the great character developments and serpentine story twists. Really one of my favorites current releases I wish I'd have held out for the Limited Edition. What can I say, standard BD/DVD combo pack period, I'm just glad I physically have it in my collection.",1481414400,,665,4.5966386554621845
