7801528,5,1932267018,"I am not a member of the SDA church, however, as a Christian I have always had a problem with traditional interpretations of the Revelation. There was always something missing and/or unbelievable with stories such as The Left Behind Series and the arguments related to things like the rapture and the tribulation...always some missing piece or something in the explanation one needs to look past in order for those stories to appear reasonable.

The point here is this. Shawn Boonstra opens the Word of God and explains everything from the Bible. As he asks in the DVD set, ""should we guess here?""...""should we take a stab in the dark?""...or should we look to The Word of God for our answers? I love that!! One of my mentors from the past always said, if anyone tells you the Bible says this or that, ask them to ""show you where"", and that is exactly what Shawn Boonstra does.

If you are a Christian who loves a practical understanding of God's Word, or just a curious passerby, then I encourage you to jump on this one and I promise you will not be sorry. Best part is the set can be purchased used for a reasonable price...not bad for 20+ hours of great, logical, scriptural teaching.

Buy with confidence.",1430006400,2,1209,4.587962962962963
7801529,5,1932267018,"This product is by IT IS WRITTEN and Pastor Shawn Boonstra, delivering a powerful message by the powerful guidance of the Holy Spirit. The messages takes you back to the book of Daniel and other reference scriptures to open your minds and hearts to prophecy and the sign of the times that we are living in which signals the soon return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to reclaim earth and rule over it. The teachings are bible based facts and evidence. Line upon line and precept upon precept. There are beautiful illustrations and pictures being used to accomodate the biblical facts. This is a power message! The CD came in a 3 volume set. In each set there are four (4) dvds which is a total of 12 dvds. The one that was purchased from Amazon was practically near new, and my family and I are enjoying them. If you are interested in Christ Jesus future plans for you, and you want to get ready for HIS soon return and be accepted in HIS Father's Heavenly Kingdom, then this is a must DVD for you. Jesus will be returning in the clouds and HE will be accompanied with HIS entire host of Holy Angels to put a final end to the devil and his host of angels, and sin.  God Bless those who hear this true prophecy from God's Word and keep it!",1320710400,2,1243,4.2893617021276595
