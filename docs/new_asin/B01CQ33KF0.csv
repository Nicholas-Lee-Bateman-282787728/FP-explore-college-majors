8753698,5,B01CQ33KF0,"I love this DVD. I've been learning the djembe, and can't afford lessons right now. But with this DVD, I'm getting those beginner lessons, and I'm able to bang away enough to enjoy myself. Zorina Wolf is simply wonderful. She explains things so clearly, I'm able to follow along without difficulty, and my daily practice has seen significant improvement in both my skills and my confidence.

I particularly like the way she explains details, like how to place your hands on the drum -- that was especially important to me, as a beginner with no outside guidance.

Ms. Wolf is so friendly and open, I find myself truly enjoying her instructions and performance. I'm an almost-50 year old woman, and with her book and video I don't feel self-conscious, or like there's something wrong with a woman my age wanting to learn how to make a lot of noise. :)

I highly recommend this video (and the accompanying book, ""Whole Person Drumming"") for anyone -- but especially those new to drumming.",1504396800,,986,4.754385964912281
