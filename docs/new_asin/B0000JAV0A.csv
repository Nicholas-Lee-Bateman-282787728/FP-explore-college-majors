1938627,4,B0000JAV0A,"My admiration of Sophia Loren borders on idolatry.  Though she will not go down in history as one of our great actresses she was not bad in the movie.

Eduardo Ponti made this movie with his mother in it and it is decisively a success.  I loved the subtle play of relationships and experiences that are all too familiar to us.  It is a lovely gentle movie in which the characters remains true to themselves and the story line is soft.  I appreciate that the movie goer's intellect are not doubted by spelling/blaring/yelling out the plot or clues.  We are trusted to pick them up ourselves and interpret them as we wish.

This movie is a true celebration of woman without needing to burn the bra.",1179100800,,696,4.476190476190476
1938628,3,B0000JAV0A,"I found this to be a very experimental and unusual

concept for a drama.  It's always a visual treat to see a

fine performance from Sophia Loren.  Her dramatic range

has expanded in her later years, lending pathos to a film

which features frankly depressing subject matter.  While

the three protagonists escape their circumstantial and

unfulfilled lives rooted in unhappy relationships with their

fathers or spouses, that escape doesn't occur until the

very very end of the drama, painting the experience in very

gloomy colors.  The concept of the three parallel lives is an

interesting one and I wondered throughout if the director,

Edoardo Ponti might be the now adult son of Sophia Loren.

I'm sure he's some relationship to Carlo Ponti.  I enjoyed

Between Strangers, but it wasn't thrilling.",1128470400,5,806,5.069230769230769
1938629,3,B0000JAV0A,"Set in modern-day's Toronto, 'Between Strangers' follows the lives of three women loosely connected to each other, played by Sophia Loren, Mira Sorvino, and Deborah Kara Unger.  The film's director Edoardo Ponti is the son of Ms. Loren.

Mira Sorvino is a successful journalist Natalia, whose recent photo shot in Angora is nationally praised, and was even used for the cover of Time maganize.  But Natalia is still tormented by the sense of guilt, for she thinks she could have done something to the little girl instead of taking photos, even though she was in the war.

Deborah Kara Unger is renowned cellist Catherine, who has run away from her husband and daughter, and keeping herself aloof from others, she is thinking about plans that have something to do with one aged male (Malcolm McDowell) who has just come out of the jail.  And Catherine is holding a loaded gun.

And Sophia Loren is a timid housewife Olivia, who works at a grocery store, and is married to John, a grim-faced man in wheelchair (Pete Postleswaite).  One day, as you and her friend Max (Gerald Depardieu) will find in the nearby park, Olivia has been seeing in her dreams the dark figures coming out of rocks, and is drawing the pictures of them on paper.  Later, as you know, we come to realize the real meaning of them.

The three stories are interwoven deftly, and the characters including the supporting ones are memorable.  The acting is unanimously good, but the most impressive is naturally Sophia Loren, who has literally become an ordinary wife.  Olivia has buried her own dream in the past, decided to live a stiflingly dismal life with her husband, and is still aware that her life is lacking something vital, and as the other two women do, she finally finds what to do in the end.

Sadly, however, the ingredients themselves in this film -- like journalist's ethics, troubled relations with father, or anything else -- are all nothing new to me, and though the script about sins and forgiveness is well-crafted, and eveything goes smooth and fits in the right place, I for one needed something more, something unique.

Maybe I have complaints about the film because I have seen films like 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her.'  But Sophia Loren is another story, and her acting alone can make this film worth your money and time.",1121126400,4,2344,4.7272727272727275
1938630,5,B0000JAV0A,"Three stories leaded by women. Three solvent actresses will make the best she can to solve her ethical and problems. Three different occupations: the devoted wife and her invalid husband, the winner photographer of the year and a cellist who faces a brutal drama familiar will fight against her fears, disappointments and disillusions with conviction, honesty following her respective bliss.

It's remarkable to underline the smart device of the phantom girl who appears in dramatic moments was used previously by Kieslowski in his masterwork: Decalogue.

Another important issue: the attack to the old man: Malcom Mc Dowell works out a incisive destiny irony due precisely Mac Dowell thirty three years before in the Clockwork Orange plays a similar role but from the other side of the street when he makes the same against an indigent in the park with his fellow friends.

The presence of Klaus Maria Bandauer and Gerard Depardieu add this artwork film another quality seal . Mira Sorvino makes a convincing role as the winner who suddenly realizes the slender difference between duty and ethic. Loren displays all her experience in a devastating revelation

1938631,5,B0000JAV0A,"""Between Strangers"" was an incredibly moving film, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to see it.
Some people may not enjoy it because there is not an obviously to it, no real action.  However, the stories of the three women that unfold are sad and dramatic and very touching.  All the actors are incredible, from Sofia Loren down to Wendy Crewson.",1083369600,5,354,4.515625
1938632,4,B0000JAV0A,"BETWEEN FRIENDS is a tough story told with unrelieved intensity, acted with underplayed angst,  and directed with quiet strength by Eduardo Ponti. The ""Strangers"" are three unrelated women, each of whom has a burden that grows until it must be lifted.
Mira Sorvino is a media photographer, daughter of Klaus Maria Brandauer (who has multiple awards for his own news photography, who has just had one of her images appear on TIME magazine - an image of a little girl from Angola  who we gradually learn died in the fire Mira was photographing.  She is haunted by the fact that the time she spent photographing the child could have been used to save the child's life.
Deborah Unger is a concert cellist whose wife-abusing father (Malcolm McDowell) is released from prison despite her conviction that he should die for his cruelty, forcing her to leave her own family in the attempt to end her father's existence.
Sophia Loren is a haggard housewife who has devoted her sad life to caring for her wheelchair-bound past athlete husband (Pete Postlethwaite) until she sees her illegitimate daughter she was forced to abandon becoming the sculptor artist she herself always wanted to be.  Each of these women have visions of the same small girl at moments when they are forced to confront their pain and each finds a way back to salvation through 'living out a dream'.
Some may find the story saccharine, but the actors deliver these sad folk in such an honest way that together they manage to capture our hearts.  It is a true pleasure to see Sophia Loren act again and even the makeup she dons for her dowdy role cannot hide the fact that she remains one of the most beautiful women the screen has known - and one of the best actresses.  All cast members are superb.  Just be aware of the fact that this is a bleak story that requires much from the viewer.  The rewards are worth it.",1074729600,18,1879,4.63855421686747

1938674,5,B0000JAV0A,"Until I happened upon this film a few weeks ago, I'd never heard of it. I started watching it on cable fifteen or so minutes in and did not move throughout the rest of the film. It's a tapestry with the stories of three different women woven together. Sophia Loren's story is the best of them all. She is beautiful, intuitive and gives a performance that warms one with touches of impressionism. Gerard Depardieu turns up in a small role.

There is no secret recipe for a movie.

Lucid, sensual, and gloriously schizophrenic.

In fact, this movie,""Between Stranges"",  with an idea in its head and a camera in its hand, enriched the speech of itself.

""A camera in your hand and an idea in your head"" was how film critic-turned-filmmaker Glauber Rocha characterized the creative conditions under which Brazil's ""Cinema Novo"" (New Cinema) began.

1938682,3,B0000JAV0A,"Between Strangers is the sort of film that never gets made in America- not in Hollywood big budget films nor in independent films, because it is a film that takes its own sweet time in conveying its ideas to the viewer. That's not to say that it's a great film, nor even a pretty good one, but watching this 2003 Canadian-Italian film on DVD, shot in Toronto, gives a viewer an insight into how other people enjoy the same basic forms of art.
 This film follows the lives of three different women, each of whom has issues surrounding a trauma involving a little girl, and their own troubles relating to the men in their lives. That the film makes heavy-handed usage of a little girl (Sydney Pearson) that appears to each of them once, as a symbol, is a flaw, since there was no need for symbolism in an otherwise realistic film. The cast is loaded with international film heavyweights, not the least of whom is Sophia Loren, whose son Edoardo Ponti (whose father is Carlo Ponti), in his first time at a film's helm, wrote and directed this film. She plays Olivia, a woman who works in a Toronto supermarket, and years earlier married an ex-athlete, now wheelchair bound invalid, John, played by Pete Postlethwaite, a man whose rage at the world is directed like a laser at his masochistic wife. Her secret is that she had a daughter out of wedlock, as a teenager, and was forced to give her up for adoption by her father. Now, the daughter (Wendy Crewson) is a famed sculptress, whose fame seems to coincide with Olivia's own rediscovery of her drawing talent, unused since her pregnancy, of works of art eerily similar to her daughter's, and encouraged by Max (Gerald Depardieu), her gardener friend at a local park. The second woman lead is Natalia Bauer, a photojournalist played by Mira Sorvino, whose photos from the war in Angola have landed her a cover of Time magazine, much to the delight of her father, Alexander (Klaus Maria Brandauer), himself a legendary photojournalist, who both encourages and discourages her passive-aggressively. Yet, she is guilt-ridden by the girl in her photo, because she could have saved the child's life, rather than gotten the photo. The third woman is Catherine (Debra Unger), a famed cellist who is stalking her ex-convict father, Alan Baxter (Malcolm McDowell), after he is released from prison after twenty-two years. She blames him for her mother's death, and this crisis has made her leave her marriage and daughter, who leaves plaintive messages on her answering machine.
  That's the set up. Little overtly occurs in the film.... Sophia Loren gives a magnificent performance in what is reputedly the hundredth film of her career. Those who have chided her as building a career on her sexuality have never seen this woman's eyes. She is one of those rarities who acts with every square inch of her body. Postlethwaite, as her husband, is also very good, and it should not surprise that the best story in the film is the one the filmmaker accorded his mother.
  Yet, I felt, to a degree, as if I were watching a slightly better than average telefilm from the 1970s, at times, but one that never quite gels into something first rate nor substantial. This is the screenplay's fault, and thus the burden lies with Ponti. It is one of those rare works of art that doesn't terribly move you, but you are better for having seen it, even though it will not haunt you. If that seems like a very mixed reaction, then I have succeeded in recapitulating my experience in watching it, and- for reasons that elude me, and despite all its flaws, I think you should watch it, too.",1220832000,2,3612,4.699842022116903

8002323,4,B0000JAV0A,"Between Strangers is about three women who find themselves in an emotional crises with regards to the men that happens to be a big part of their lives. It stars an ensemble cast that includes Sophia Loren,Mira Sorvino,Deborah Kara Unger,Pete Postlethwaite,Klaus Maria Brandauer,Malcolm McDowell and Grard Depardieu.

Olivia takes care of her husband John,who is on wheelchair. Despite her old age,she still wanted to pursue a career as an artist. But her husband does not want to listen to her stories about it and she finds solace from Max,a French gardener. While Natalia is a news photographer that is assigned to do work in Angola. She took a picture of a child orphaned during war. Her well-known photojournalist father made her famous for it but she is haunted by the fact that she wasn't able to save the child's life. Meanwhile,a musician named Catherine has never resolved her hate towards her father,who killed her mother by beating her to death. When her father was released from prison,she wanted to kill her father. But she does not know that he has changed for the better.

The film tackles three themes:hope,redemption and forgiveness. This was shown by the three main female characters in Olivia,Natalie and Catherine respectively. Although the story could have been interesting,we get into one clich after another with the three main female characters trying to fight their own personal demons. Added to that,there were really no great performances due to underdeveloped characters in it despite the fact that we have a talented cast on the film. It was obvious that the film tried to rely on the films famous faces particularly the gorgeous and age-less Sophia Loren.
