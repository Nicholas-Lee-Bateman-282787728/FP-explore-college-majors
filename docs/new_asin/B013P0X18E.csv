8728368,5,B013P0X18E,"This is an adorable Chuggington DVD that features six episodes, all of which have been previously aired on television. My three kids love Chuggington and it is such a wholesome show for young kids. I admit too it makes me laugh! The characters are all unique and have such cute personalities. I like though the lessons taught such as teamwork, responsibility and friendship. My kids love being able to watch Chuggington whenever they want, especially since we tend to miss it on television.
