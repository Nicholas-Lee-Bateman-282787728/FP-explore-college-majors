8468292,5,B005EIJGSU,"A wonderful film focusing on the real essence and purpose of life.
The stakes are high. Family or career! One or the other! No way out! A choice many of us have to make in life.
Jeff Mackay and Jeremy King are spectacular in their portrayal of father and son as their complicated relationship evolves  throughout the film.
In the end, watching this movie gives you a  real sobering experience. It wakes you up, makes you focus, and hopefully changes your perspective on what really counts in life.
A ""must see"" for anybody with a modicum of sensitivity, empathy and human connection.",1330992000,,583,4.705882352941177
