1330831,5,B00003IRHT,"I admit it....I am a consumate collector of Jackie Kennedy books, magazines, and videos. I have all videos that are available, including all the are listed here at amazon.com.  Don't get me wrong: all of these videos  are wonderful windows to the past, and I recommend that you have these for  your collection as well. However, this video has something  special..something difficult to describe. I believe it captures the  ""feeling"" and esssense of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis.  This video strives to make Mrs. Onassis alive and a vivid, living person  who sustained unspeakable tragedies. To be able to carry on and raise two  wonderful children after seeing her husbands head explode is a testament to  her inner strength and courage. I admire(d) her enourmously even though I,  like so many of you, was born after President Kennedy's murder in Dallas. I  have watched and re-watched this video many times and have yet to tire of  it. So many people who were friends and business associates speak glowingly  of her and her times and accomplishments. We need another Jackie Kennedy  today in this ungracious world of ours and this video serves to prove that  need.  Buy this video.....I promise you will not regret it.",959644800,26,1230,4.955882352941177

7918878,5,B00003IRHT,Too real and lends doubt of her made up persona,1429056000,,47,3.8
7918879,5,B00003IRHT,"The title is slightly misleading, but I enjoyed this documentary very much. Jackie is still very enigmatic so one can only get ""behind the myth"" to a certain degree, but I learned a great deal more about her background and early life with John Kennedy. DVD was delivered very quickly & perfectly packaged.",1386028800,,305,4.773584905660377
7918880,5,B00003IRHT,"PBS is one of the best publicly owned networks and always produces the best quality work. Great because it brings together many historical pieces of footage that I have seen but did not know their precise context. This film bring everything into context and frames every event in chorological order.

 I did enjoy how it was attempted to retain Jackie's voice throughout the film, however it was also one of the things I liked the least. There are several times in the film when someone speaks as though trying to mimic the tone and inflection of her voice which should never be done.

However the context of the film itself was very good. I recommend reading a Bio on Jackie before you watch the film. It allows you to understand the facts in the film that are mentioned in passing.",1320278400,,783,4.578571428571428
7918881,5,B00003IRHT,It was really detailed but not depressing. I thought I covered a lot of the historical facts around her life without intruding into the facts that we really don't need to know. Since she spent most of her life after the death of JFK trying to sheild herself and her children from the press it was good to see that for the most part this biography wasn't too intruding.,1233705600,,368,4.3478260869565215
7918882,5,B00003IRHT,"This is an excellent production.

You can pay the resellers $80 here, or still get it for $20 at PBS.",1190246400,,101,4.05
7918883,2,B00003IRHT,I was totally not happy with this DVD. It's kind of boring and I hated the voice overs. The chick that was reading Jackie's diaries was so lame. Don't waste your money on this one. I wished it had more pics of Jackie instead of scenery pictures of Rhode Island and Virginia and DC and NYC. I wouldn't recomend it.,1183766400,3,313,4.233333333333333
7918884,1,B00003IRHT,seller did not have item and I hope I have not been billed for it nor have I received any information if and when it would be available.,1167782400,,136,3.892857142857143
7918885,5,B00003IRHT,I watched this whole documentry on PBS TV...coudnt resist myself from buying the video! DO NOT EVEN READ THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS. Just buy it and it will prove to very good addition in your collection...for years to come. Ofcourse you wouldnt want to watch it once you have ...but still...,1049068800,,286,4.74
7918886,5,B00003IRHT,"This is a great video.  It shows many rare clips I'd never seen before.  Though I'd already read a few books on Jackie I still learned new info.  Covers her life from birth to death (not just the presidency years).  I highly recommend it for both ardent fans, and people just learning about her.",995846400,7,295,4.407407407407407
