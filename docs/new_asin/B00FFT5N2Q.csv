8615409,3,B00FFT5N2Q,"""Downtown""(1975) is directed by Jess Franco (Female Vampire). This isn't Jess Franco's most creative film, but it's still enjoyable to watch. It's about a private detective (Jess Franco) who takes on the job of photographing his client's husband who is seeing another woman. Jess Franco really gets into his role and in one sequence is actually throwing himself (fully clothed) into the midst of two naked women, one of whom is Lina Romay. Jess Franco looks like he's at a banquet fully revelling in the meal. I wonder how many times he had to shoot this scene just to get it right!

This movie looks good and plays fine on a North American blu-ray player. The voices are in German with English subtitles. There are no special features.",1457481600,,736,4.75
