1354765,4,B00004U9QT,"The madcap slapstick adventure won't appeal to everyone, but there is much that is original and funny.
I must say, though, to those reviewers who have been whining about the DVD, that you're way off base.  This is a 1973 film, remember, that has a lovely widescreen non-anamorphic DVD transfer with a rich, accurate color palette and excellent sharpness throughout.  It is clearly NOT from a VHS original, and is one of the better looking 1970's DVD's you will see.  Thirty years after the fact, with a film that will not sell a million copies, you cannot complain about the lack of special features.  Thanks, Facets, for giving us a clear look at a forgotten classic!",1090108800,18,668,4.732758620689655

You don't *want* to hear the English dubbing from the original release.  They even changed the character's name from ""Pivert"" to ""Beaver""...
(I haven't yet seen this DVD -- i intend to do so as soon as possible -- the five stars above are for the film, one of the great slapstick comedies of all time.

1354768,5,B00004U9QT,"I just watched the movie on DVD last night and was reminded once again why Louis de Funes was my favorite actor growing up even though I don't even speak French. I've seen plenty of his comedies, and some of his best are part of the Gendarme-series, where he plays a cop who encounters human-looking Extraterrestrials at one point. He has to throw water on them to make them rust.
The DVD image is of great quality even though you may not have heard of the releasing studio before. As far as the plot, if you like screwball comedies, this is one of the best available.",1082678400,8,568,4.367924528301887

1354771,5,B00004U9QT,It is about time that this classic screwball slapstick comedy is available to the US. When I originally saw this film in the theatres back in 73- I laughed alot- and now this film is still one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen- According to the description of the DVD the film is in French and has english subtitles- if this is correct- Who cares!- The story and slapstick make the film- In any language Rabbi Jacob is a good time.,1078012800,7,439,4.301204819277109

& most hillarious film ever !
Pulling no punches the movie exposes racism of all kind that of the french of course but also the ever actual middle-eastern brand of bigotry. It's brillance resides in it's evenhandedness in
denouncing racism as a sign of intellectual weakness. Plus the gags are fast & furious throughout the very entertaining 90 minutes of pleasure ! highly recommended !",1077926400,3,453,4.82051282051282
1354773,5,B00004U9QT,"'I have become an actor so I can bring a smile to the children and their parents in these sad times'..so said Louis de Funes, one of the greatest comedians ever, and who is still to this day, even with the huge boom in the DVD market and the increased interest in 'international' films, largely unknown outside France and the francophone countries, even after having 145 films to his name from 1945 to 1982, a year before his death.
Like Chaplin and Sellers,De Funes is one of the very rare breed of comedians who had a distinct talent and total dedication to his craft, and who knew how to make people laugh,not through the written script only but also through his interpretations and character. All three giants of comedy have had such a complex and interesting personalities, both on and off screen, that always added another dimension and depth to their acting.
To watch any De Funes film is to be totally captivated by a unique style that none of his contemporaries in French and world cinema were able to come near: The expressions on his face and his very French theatrical,dramatic and sometimes over the top body language is legendary, so is his ability to dominate every scene without overshadowing his co stars,something not very easily achieved!
The characters he played over the years, especially in his later films post 60s remind me somehow of Wayne Mitchell's Arthur in Brit 70s sitcom Till Death Do us Part: nasty, sexist,racist, and bitter..But like Mitchell, his is a lone voice that is portrayed in such a way as to make it one that belongs to a minority older generation not quite in tune with the changes the world has seen,and as such is never quite offensive or threatening but totally hilarious.
In Adventures of Rabbi Jacob, one of his most successful films (along with such classics like Le Corniaud, La Grande Vadrouille, La Zizanie, Oscar, L'Aile ou la Cuisse and others), he impersonates a rabbi, along with an Algerian fugitive, running away from assassins, and goes to New York and is mistaken for a very important rabbi.
In this film as in other De Funes movies, he is thrown in a adventure by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and is forced to face his prejudices head on, in this case against both Jews and Arabs, and becomes a different man as a result.
It is a very funny film in the De Funes unique tradition, and although the script might be uneven at times, it is his performance that makes up for any flaws: a twitch of a nose, or some incomprehensible mumblings transforms the scene totally!
Louis De Funes is an actor that should at last get his dues in the US and UK and the wide recognition he deserves,(by releasing his most famous films on DVD and soon) for denying large number of viewers of his comedies is depriving cinema lovers of a true genuis with a great personality and undeniable class.",1075852800,13,2853,4.629191321499014
1354774,5,B00004U9QT,An excellent old film from an equally excellent actor. I thoroughly recommend it for the lovers of good old comedy films.,1373500800,,121,4.809523809523809
1354775,4,B00004U9QT,"As a born American, I have been educated to take a dim view of French culture (they feel the same about us).
After all, we have been told that Jerry Lewis is very popular to this day in France.
This movie was made at the same time that comedy reached a peak in the US and Britain, with ""Saturday Nite Live"", ""All in the Family"", ""Monty Python"", ""Taxi"", ""Barney Miller"" and ""Yes, Minister"".  These all represented a sophisticated, nuanced and intelligent form of humor.
When I first saw ""Rabbi Jacob"" years ago, it seemed to me to be a throwback of a half-century to the old days of Vaudeville and slapstick comedy like ""The Keystone Cops"" and the ""The Three Stooges"" with losts of pies thrown in people's faces and actors making weird facial expressions in rapid succession.  We see lots of this in this film and so I was more or less turned off. After all, how could this compete with Monty Python's soccer game between 19th century German philosophers and ancient Greek philosophers?  Or how about the quiz show about the English Football League with a panel consisting of Marx, Lenin and Mao Tse-Tung?
Having said this, recent reviewing of ""Rabbi Jacob"" has increased my appreciation for the film.  First, Louis De Funes is certainly an amazing actor, even if his form of comedy ( e.g. making funny faces in quick succession) is not really up my alley. His learning to portray someone immitating a Hasidic Rabbi required a lot of talent, in addition to his ability to learn Hasidic dancing which is probably the highlight of the film.
Secondly, this is a lavish production with expensive sets like the complex Yankee chewing gum factory (is that name supposed to be a subtle anti-American jab?) which, unfortunately took too much time in the movie and was super silly and rather boring. The ending at the Palace with the helicopter, mounted honor guard and limousine going around in circles was, on the other hand, quite impressive and no doubt expensive as well to produce.  Also the chase scene in the streets of Paris was impressive as well.
Thirdly, as I stated in the title of the review, this was an introduction to French culture and attitudes for me.  A notable example is the way the police are portrayed. They come across as clumsy idiots who are on a power trip.  This is in extreme contrast to the friendly English ""bobbie"" or the American police officer who serves the public.  The reason for this is the French police were for centuries identified with protecting the reactionary monarchy and not the public. In order to do this they had to view the public as a potentially dangerous rabble and were quick to use truncheons or tear gas on demonstrators. Films made of the riots in Paris in May 1968 show four or five policemen with truncheons beating a teenage demonstrator on the ground. Thus, it is easy to see why the police would have a negative image.
Taking all this into consideration I would say the film was entertaining and worth the time to watch it even if French comedy is not really my cup of tea.",1329523200,,3028,4.6361940298507465
1354776,5,B00004U9QT,"I first saw this one on the big screen back in the 70s, and a few times since then, but never on DVD until now. This movie displays the genius of Louis de Funes at its height. When I first saw it, my friend laughed so hard she banged her head on the seat in front of her and needed medical help, but she would not leave until the movie was over. Sheer comic genius. The quality of the DVD has been commented upon, but who cares? I was too busy laughing my head off. A true classic.",1328313600,,481,3.9183673469387754
1354777,5,B00004U9QT,"This is one of many great films by Louis de Funes, the wonderful French comedian.  It's a typical 70's comedy, full of twists and turns, silly police, car chases and more.  The movie is clean and appropriate for the whole family.  Our children love this movie and even enjoy watching it with subtitles while listening to French.  It's become our family's tradition to watch this movie during the Thanksgiving week.

The movie stars Louis de Funes as an arrogant, prejudiced French factory owner who could not care less for his workers or anyone who isn't French, white or Catholic.  In a hilarious series of events, he finds out that his driver Solomon is Jewish, fires him and then ends up getting stuck in a bubble gum factory - this is probably one of the most hilarious comedy scenes of all times.  There he gets entangled in a plot to eliminate Slimane, a political challenger to a military regime of an unnamed Arab country from North Africa.  This sends him and Slimane into hiding as Jewish rabbis who eventually end up in Solomon's synagogue.  The movie has a happy ending, with all the main characters learning to be more tolerant of each other and actually coming to appreciate other cultures, religions and races.

It's a pitty they just don't make movies like this anymore.  This is a terrific movie, one of those gems that I'd recommend to anyone.",1309824000,2,1361,4.70042194092827

1354785,4,B00004U9QT,"I saw a customer take this out from the library, so I decided to borrow it after him.  I mean, it had a very unique name, but I didn't know what to expect.  Since I've never heard of this movie before I came out knowing nothing about it, which for me ended up being a good thing, because I love it now. At first I hated the slapstick, but after a while you get into it and appeciate how funny it is. It's about a guy, Mr. Victor Pivert, who accidentally overhears and thwarts the assassination of revolutionary leader Slimane, but ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob to get away from killers.  Mr. Pivert is Catholic (and sadly gives a bad image of us Catholics) but since he is disguised as a rabbi, he ends up learning about and appreciating Judaism. What happens to the real Rabbi Jacob is priceless. The dvd itself is awful. You have to click on everything twice to access anything. Also they don't list their filmographies chronologically, which confused me because the dvd says this was Oury and Funes last movie together, and I got horribly confused as to which came first ""The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob"" or ""Delusions of Grandeur"" (""...Rabbi Jacob"" came first). I had to check again to make sure.
Thank goodness I borrowed this from my university's library and didn't pay for it, because they could've made it into a more user friendly dvd.
In short, the movie was great, but the dvd people blew it big time.",1187395200,2,1414,4.4728682170542635
1354786,5,B00004U9QT,"I originally saw an English version of this film in a cinema over 30 years ago and was delighted to find it was available on DVD. The fact that the soundtrack on the DVD is in French, one of the (n-1) languages I do not speak, made no difference to my enjoyment of seeing it again. This film tells a good story. It is inoffensive. The acting is superb, with just enough exaggeration to remove the content from the reality of everyday life and enable the viewer recapture the experience of seeing a proper movie. The humour ranges from the subtle to the extreme slapstick and the result is one very, very funny film. I have no hesitation in stating it is the funniest one I have ever seen. There are lots of other good comedies but none come close to The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob. It is in a class of its own.

We ordered this movie from Amazon and watched it with our children (4 and 6 yrs old) - everybody had a great time (the children especially liked the bubble gum factory scenes). There are a few gunshots and a fight but the violence is cartoonish, G rating is fitting.  Great lessons about overcoming racism and respecting cultural and religious (here Jewish) traditions.

Well OK there is some mess with bubble gum, but that's not the kind of clean I mean.  ;-)  Definitely one of the better comedies I have seen over the last few years, and I may soon be adding this to my collection.

I would recommend, however, that you NOT pay full price for this DVD; rather, see if you can snag a used copy from an Amazon Marketplace seller.

He's indeed very funny in this movie, but this is not his best film.  Why his other classics, such as La Grande Vadrouille, L'Aile Ou La Cuisse or others are not released with english subtitles is quite beyond me!
This movie gets 4.5 stars from me; it goes by quickly and it has many incredibly funny parts, but it doesn't quite seem to flow as smoothly as those other De Funs films that I've seen (while on my vacation to Russia, where they're shown all the time on tv).  The ending, in particular, is chaotic and confusing.
The DVD, however gets 3/5 from me.  The quality might be a BIT better than a VHS, and the picture is clean, but it's still not nearly as sharp as most DVDs out there.  Also, there is no option to turn off the subtitles (which are pretty good, although  not everything is translated and a few puns such as ""Pivert"" vs ""pervert"" took a while for me to sink in).
Frankly, they have no excuse for the lack of effort on the DVD.  This DVD is currently pretty high on the Amazon.ca sales rankings. Louis de Funs' most popular movie, La Grande Vadrouille, is even higher (~136) and was chosen for ""Le meilleur de l'anne 2003"" (""The best of year 2003"").  So it REALLY baffles me why nobody is bothering to release any of this comedian's other movies for English speaking audiences, in GOOD DVDs; the market is certainly there.  PLEASE, PLEASE release more Louis De Funs DVDs!

7923766,1,B00004U9QT,"This film should be in French and English with , of course, subtitles in French and English.
I just received the film in German but it is does not work on  the American system. No indication about his restriction when I ordered the film.
I am going to return the film with great disappointment as I was looking forward to revisiting this hysterically funny film.",1506211200,,362,4.569230769230769
7923767,1,B00004U9QT,Movie is not in English and was not listed as being in a foreign language. I notified seller that I wanted to return film unless seller had an English version. Seller has not responded.,1495497600,,185,4.470588235294118
7923768,5,B00004U9QT,"My favorite movie.  I can see this over and over again and still laugh aloud each time.  When feeling ""down"", I play this DVD and my blues vanish.  Louis de Funes has a remarkable face and is a superb actor/comedian.  The plot and other actors are delightful as well.  A good family movie too - my grandchildren love it!",1438992000,3,320,4.3559322033898304
7923769,5,B00004U9QT,"Louis de Funes (a famous French comedian) plays a bigot who's late to his daughter's wedding.  Meanwhile, Rabbi Jacob is coming from New York to go to his nephew's bar mitzvah in Paris, which he hasn't seen in years.  De Funes runs into revolutionaries and secret police, and to escape them disguises himself as a rabbi.  He's mistaken for Rabbi Jacob and the funny gets even funnier.  His daughter is played by Miou-Miou, but she has only a minor role (one of her first, I think) in this very funny film.
I bought this film to replace the VHS copy we had at the local French video library.",1406160000,,590,4.435185185185185

7923771,5,B00004U9QT,One of the best of Louise de Funes movies. Made me laugh so hard I was in stitches. Loved it!,1400112000,,93,3.7
7923772,5,B00004U9QT,"It's a great film, humane and funny, one of the best movies with Louis de Funes. Music by Vladimir Cosma is amazing.

Service from Family Biz has been great: at first they send me a DVD without English subtitles, but then , after I let them know about the mistake, then sent the film with subtitles and extra 2 DVDs.",1392681600,,316,4.266666666666667
