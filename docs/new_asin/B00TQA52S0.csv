8702737,5,B00TQA52S0,"I haven't purchased the DVD, but I saw a screening of this at my local AMC theater.  What I particularly like about the Exhibition on Screen productions is that they are beautifully directed and executed.  In this film there is a short segment where an artist shows you how Rembrandt painted and another on how the prints were made.  The film moves seamlessly from views and discussions of the paintings in the exhibition to a succinct review of the stages of Rembrandt's life to the brief demonstrations described above.  The photography is fabulous, but it is the concept and its execution that really makes these films stand out.",1442707200,5,632,4.824074074074074
