4998167,5,B006JSY3VE,"This was a fun special. We have almost all the Lucy specials now! I would probably pick ""Happy Anniversary & Goodbye"" as my favorite thus far, but this was pretty good. I'd probably like it more if I'd been around back then and was more of a fan of all those stars. The beginning of this special was one star after another coming in to say hello to Lucy. I've always found it curious that, with all the actors I love from the ""good old days,"" and with how big Lucy was with using special guest stars, none of them ever appeared together. (There's one exception. She starred with Bea Arthur in Mame, which of course was highly criticized. I loved it.) Anyway, the final third of ""Lucy Moves to NBC"" was a sort of a pilot for a new show, and once that started, Lucy was barely in the special anymore.

So I'll give the special itself 4 stars and give it a bonus star for all the special features. Bob Hope especially... he was in the special, and two of the special features. Lucy's appearance on his show was particularly funny. Bob Hope I have to know well, both because of his work on ""I Love Lucy"" and the four movies they did together.

I have especially enjoyed the ""Let's Talk to Lucy"" radio segments. (They have some of these as special features on ""Here's Lucy"" also.) They are short, and even though Lucy is interviewing OTHER actors, I feel I am learning a lot about HER. I've read several books about her, and frankly, they are boring, because they are all the same. Once you've read one, that's really all you need. Lucy announces at the beginning of her show that she wants to talk as herself, and she is. I have really enjoyed learning about causes and issues that were important to her.",1333929600,2,1700,4.359621451104101
4998168,4,B006JSY3VE,"What a rousing welcome lucy received from bob hope(really a walkon part)to johnny carson(then king of late night tv) jack klug(quincy)Gary coleman(different strokes)to gene kelly and donald oconnor(Francis the talking mules films). Of course it shows what a star line up nbc had at that time,as all these were hit tv shows,and were my favourites i recall watching them avidly at the time as nbc was one of my favorite networks and had good programming leading to Seinfeld and Friends and many other hit dramas. Many of the stars do walk on parts and don't stay that long,but donald o'connor has a lengthy bit and a long banjo routine. It's interesting the special begins with lucy discussing her previous shows,reminiscent of the old jack benny program of a show about the making of a show and its too bad they didn't stay with this theme throughout
it would have been fun but it soon devolves around a series of star skits and when donald o'connor comes on Lucy disappears for a long while. Sadly the last tv series she filmed after this special,didnt last long and perhaps she was too old and frail for a weekly show,interesting a live audience. It was sad that the cbs network let her go,declining ratings or what or attracting not enough younger viewers or the diffferent things sponsors were looking for? She really made cbs but stranger things have happened

Bonus material...funny segment directed by lucy on world of monks which is fast disappearing as a society from our world. I wonder what influences in the future will take their place...also old radio show with bob appearing talking about visiting a school where prayer was disallowed..and a good sermon on
lucy about raising children and giving them values even through teaching them about the world through various means including newspapers making them world citizens of sorts,and i wonder why the producers choose to add this to the
bonus disc about making american youth thinkers and teaching thinking skills
Also a segment on the bob hope show from bob texaco hope who often took some
criticism for being so corporate friendly but he makes no apologies and i
recall all those live shots at drilling sites and wherever actually doing ads
for his many sponsors,and i think texaco was one of his most loyal,although he had sponsors back from his radio days. He really was the only comedian back
from radio who made it so big as a movie star..most others tried but failed and
who hosted the Oscars more than him?This special was not as funny as some of the others she made,more a series of skits.",1333065600,2,2562,4.783295711060948
4998169,5,B006JSY3VE,"After 30 years or so, I spent a Sunday afternoon with my favorite redhead, Lucille Ball.  I was very impressed with the release of this special. No surprise there! After all they have not let me down with any of their products relating to Lucy.

I recommend this treasure to all of the Lucille Ball fans out there.  The extras are wonderful as well and gives a nice piece of television history. Love it and well worth the price.  Enjoy all!  I sure did.",1332633600,13,453,4.345238095238095
4998170,5,B006JSY3VE,"In 1980, after spending almost 30 years being under contract with CBS, Lucy found that CBS had lost interest in her and no longer requested nor needed her. This dealt a hard blow to Lucy who wanted to work in television forever, so Lucy ended her long television career with CBS by making a television special for NBC. The special, appropriately titled Lucy Moves To NBC, aired on February 8, 1980.

A 68 year old Lucy was simply bored not producing or starring in her own series and found that her retirement which consisted of backgammon games, family, friends and some help from a little wine or vodka to pass the time was just not enough for her. While retirement was a welcome retreat after a lifetime of work for most people, Lucy was truly happy only when she was working. Lucy really looked forward to doing this television special for NBC.

The story begins with the President of NBC, Fred Silverman, talking Lucy back into show business as a producer. Mr. Silverman asks Lucy if she would produce a new musical variety series called The Music Mart. The series stars Bob Hope,  Johnny Carson, Gene Kelly, Jack Klugman, Gary Coleman, Robert Alda, Ruta Lee, Doris Singleton, Gale Gordon who plays Lucy's production assistant with heavyweights Donald O'Connor and Gloria DeHaven. This one hour special actually had a half hour show attached to it, which featured Donald O'Connor and Gloria DeHaven- a married couple doing musical numbers along with their son Scotty (He's fabulous on the banjo)- kind of a pilot which never went any further than this special. MPI states the running time for this dvd is 120 minutes, which leaves an hour of special bonus features for us to enjoy!

The Bonus Features include A Remembrance of Lucy Moves to NBC- which is 20 minutes of fond memories from some of the cast and crew on working with Lucy. Jack Klugman recalls when he got some of those little notes from Lucy on how to give a better performance that Lucy was famous for leaving her guest stars- like Danny Kaye. Also included are hilarious outtakes- especially funny are Bob Hope's ad-libs and Johnny Carson's cussing. Lucy can't stop laughing! More great bonuses include Lucy on The Bob Hope Special, Let's Talk To Lucy and more. Also included is a Lucille Ball directed pilot that never went anywhere called Bungle Abbey which starred Gale Gordon as the Abbot of a monestary. Even though the supporting cast starred Charlie Callas and more great comedians, a sitcom about monks just isn't that funny, so this pilot never went any further. Even though the show is not that funny, it's still a treat to have this rare Lucy directed pilot included with the bonuses in this dvd.

This is a memorable last hurrah for Lucy's television specials and is a real treat for us Lucy fans thanks to MPI making it available this March 2012. I haven't seen this special since it's original airing in 1980, and I can't wait to see Lucy again doing a duet with Donald O'Connor singing and dancing to that lovely old song, A Real Live Girl!",1326931200,32,3026,4.691148775894539
4998171,5,B006JSY3VE,"I've waiting for this special to come out. I taped this special way back in 1980.
my copy is kind of poor looking now, glad its finally coming out on march 20.
dont know what the bonus features will be. MPI has done a great job with lucy's other dvds.
as of 2/6/12 i found out one of the bonus features will be bungle abbey a pilot lucy directed in 1981.
ive only seen 2 very short clips of it. the pilot is about a group of monks. with gale gordon and charlie callas.",1326672000,14,468,3.9893617021276597

4998185,5,B006JSY3VE,"It's kind of bittersweet that Lucy Moves to NBC was Lucy's last TV Special (not including the hit CBS TV Movie The Stone Pillow that aired in 1985.  The first hour is good and is kind of sweet with all of NBC's big stars welcoming Lucy to NBC, however, the last last hour hour is a dated pilot starring Donald O'Connor and Gloria DeHaven which is just terrible.  I bought this DVD but just watched the first hour and the bonus material.  The pilot I have no interest to watch again and that's why it never made it to series.  A must for Lucy fans.",1380758400,2,547,4.180952380952381
4998186,2,B006JSY3VE,"Lucille Ball signed a production deal with NBC after her decades long tenure with CBS ended.
This tacky TV special was the launch of that deal. Age got the best of her. Nolonger could she be silly at 70. Comedy styles had changed and she was stuck in time. This special and a pilot for a TV sitcom directed by Lucille Ball was all that NBC got from this ""we finally got Lucy, but it was too late"" deal. ABC and Aaron Spelling would try ""Lucy"" in '86 and would also fail.",1380067200,5,470,4.119565217391305

If you love Lucy you will love this one!",1362009600,,361,4.0

4998189,4,B006JSY3VE,"The introduction to this special is cute and unique. I love Lucy's facial expressions in this special as she says her wisecracks. The ""Hello, Lucy"" production number is funny as you watch Lucy's facial expressions and is well done. Lucy and Johnny or Bob Hope work well together but Gary Coleman irritates me. Lucy and Gale's reactions together are great. Once we see Lucy hire Gale Lucille became Lucy scrambling to follow Gale's orders. That is classic. The ""Singing in the Rain"" dance number by Donald is not bad but not good. He cannot even get his steps to match the chorus girls. Lucy's reaction to him pretending not wanting to get on stage with him melts her age away and their dance number together is superub. The Music Mart pilot is cute and funny at times. It seems somewhat old fashioned but compares to Happy Days a popular sitcom at the time. Gale inteacts great with Scotty as the loan officer. Lucy's Sister Hitchcock is a classic performance. Lucy's facial expressions steal the show and she sings ""Bill Bailey"" while shaking a mean tamborine. The Cogan family interacts nicely and Donald and Gloria's number is sweet but old fashioned. However, Scotty's banjo solo is breathtaking music. The ending where Lucy finds out Gary Coleman is now the president is not that funny. It should have ended with Lucy as Sister Hitchcock sighing as the Cogans walk away.

Bungle Abbey is not that funny. It is TV gone bad with stale jokes and forced physical comedy.

I love Let's Talk to Lucy. After joking with Bob which she does naturally she promotes National Children's Book week and talks about nurturing children's curiousity. It is a heartfelt revelation how Lucy really felt about raising children and is very honest and upfront.

The Lucy guest appearance on Bob Hope's special is one of her best. She is cute and hilarious as she does the skit and it is great to see Doris and Gary alongside her. She is so happy, pretty, radiant, and enjoyable. The introduction to Lucy Moves to NBC is interesting commennt on Lucy and the big special. I love Lucy's face in some of the outakes. She is having a ball and making such great expressions. She never lost her ability to make you laugh when you look at her.",1340668800,3,2218,4.667519181585678

I have a copy of this special someone recorded on their VCR with the Donald O'Connor pilot edited out and the quality was poor. So, this release was a welcome treat. It was great to see the whole show intact and looking wonderful. MPI has really done a great job with the Lucille Ball Specials.",1335916800,3,408,4.243589743589744
4998191,5,B006JSY3VE,"I loved this DVD; what a fun show!  It is very well done, proof that Lucy did know what works for her and what does not.  I wish she would have returned to series tv in 1980-81 and not 1986.  Anyway, I missed this show when it aired since i was only 8 but I'm glad it is finally out on DVD.  The 'show within a show' part with Donald O'connor is just so-so but all the parts with Lucy are very well done.  It's more of a nostalgia trip really though for folks who love Lucy.  I don't think a young audience would really get into this.  But for the price it is well worth it!",1334102400,3,574,3.8547008547008548
