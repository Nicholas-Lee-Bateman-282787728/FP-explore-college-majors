8343682,5,B001UHLNY4,"The Maranatha world prophecy updates are really cool.  This conference in particular made me really want to check out the news.  It showed me how uninformed I am about the world.  To be honest, I am not super obsessed with looking for more signs of the end times that are coming true today.  It's not that I don't believe it, I just know the Lord is coming back soon either way.  But you know what, Amir is from the Israel military and he is giving us first hand accounts of what is going on over there.  This is some stuff that they won't tell you on CBS.  Either way this series will drive you to the scriptures and to current events.  Be informed and check this out!",1239062400,,669,4.21259842519685

Iran, I guess, inspired Syria. North Korea was there to supply the material, Russia was there to supply the defense and Iran was there to pay the bill to both.  This is the Axis of Evil that will cause the domino effect in the Middle East very soon....""",1236643200,,410,4.694444444444445
