7876360,5,6304673159,"For any Princess Diana fan-this video is recommended to add! Not so seem callous, but this is a good one to get to remember Princess Diana as someone who did alot of good in life & is still to this very day well loved!",1274486400,,218,3.977272727272727
7876361,4,6304673159,"The video starts out with some shots of the flowers people put out for the Princess, then a bit of the funeral, followed by what is mostly a history of her life with the Royal Family and ends with the hearse going through the gates at Althorp. You see a lot of footage from the entire time period, a little of it unfamiliar to me, but don't really learn anything most of us don't already know. The writers avoided going very deeply into the scandal area and give the Diana/Dodi romance story a little too much credence in my view but on the whole a good program to watch and own, especially if you can't afford to have all of the videos out there.",1001980800,,647,4.225806451612903
