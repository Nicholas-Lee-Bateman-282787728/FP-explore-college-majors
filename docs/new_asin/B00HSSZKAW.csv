6207732,5,B00HSSZKAW,I have watch all but the last few shows in season 5. My husband loves it. The price for the complete set is a great price since I've looked several web sites including sic-fi. I am going to order the box set for father's day.,1400112000,,225,4.022222222222222
6207733,5,B00HSSZKAW,"I watched the pilot on Netflix and was hooked. The Star of the show may be Saul R,but i think the crazy funny Eddie McClintock who plays Pete,makes me watch. He has all the good lines and cracks me up silly. Joanne Kelly makes a good partner for Pete.
Highly recommended!",1399248000,7,271,4.333333333333333
6207734,2,B00HSSZKAW,"This could be a bit premature given this hasn't been released yet, but when looking at the price of this set, and comparing it to the price of buying all 5 seasons separately, this set had better have a TON of extra goodies to make this price even somewhat reasonable.  If this set is nothing more than all 5 season sets in a collectors box...this is not worth it.  You can buy all 5 seasons on their own for somewhere around $100.  Keep that in mind before you jump at ordering this set.",1397520000,18,488,4.225806451612903
6207735,3,B00HSSZKAW,"Warehouse 13 has been one of the best things Syfy has done since changing its name. If you haven't seen it, think ""Friday The 13th:The Series"" from the 1990s with a bit of Rod Serling mixed in. As with Eureka, it got a bit sillier as time went on, but unlike the former series it never lost that edge of seriousness which makes for really good science-fantasy. As we prepare to witness the final demise of the series (if not the Warehouse itself - which I fervently hope doesn't happen as it will allow for a possible reboot in the future) I'll be sad to see it go. In this age when sci-fi-fantasy is dominated by horror subjects such as werewolves, vampires, ghosts and zombies or violent space-operas (the new Battlestar Galactica comes to mind), there are preacious few shows which really appeal to the classic sci-fi-fantasy buff. Once this is gone, great (or even good) sci-fi-fantasy will only be available through BBC featues such as ""Doctor Who"" and ""Orphan Black"". Bottom line: if you knew and liked ""Friday The 13th: The Series"" you'll like ""Warehouse 13"". And if you liked Eureka, there are the infamous Claudia/Fargo crossover stories.
That being said, I'm not sure what is in this complete edition which is not available in the original offerings of seasons 1-4 (and of course the soon-to-be-released season 5) thats worth having especially at this price. If you have held off buying, it's probably worth your money but if you're like most of us who have been buying the series as it was made available, there's nothing worth the large price tag here. At least I don't think so.
SPOILER ALERT:Do Not Read Beyond Here If You Want To Be Surprised
The underlying plot of ""Warehouse 13"" follows the adventures of two U.S. Secret Service Agents who accidentally witness a Warehouse snag in progress. They are immediately recruited and find themselves collecting artifacts with supernatural properties and thus carrying on a legacy which goes back to the dawn of human civilization. Artifacts encountered include Poe's pen and diary, Lewis Caroll's mirror, Lovecraft's silver key among others. The actual building and much of its attendant hard- and software are the combined brainchildren of Nicola Tesla, Albert Einstein and M.C. Escher. And agents carry stun-pistols called Teslas and communicators called Farnsworths, named for their respective inventors.
Although the show continues to follow the original two SS Agents, Pete Latimer and Mika Bering, we also follow the lives of head-agent Artie, junior-agent Claudia Donovan and even the mysterious Mrs. Fredrick, the keeper of the warehouse.
In this series there is no clear definition between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" - every character is a mixed bag. Even the fun-loving, child-like Pete is battling alchoholism and has his dark, solidly grown-up moments. And every character faces his or her demons at some point, usually as the result of contact with an artifact. And every season seems to end with a catastrophic cliff-hanger which is always resolved but with lasting consequences, a far cry from the usual ""we fix the problem in the first episode of the next season and move on"" formula of other series.",1395878400,13,3166,4.986767485822306

This series is missing at least two episodes from the discs; that is very unfortunate because I loved the show so much..
Who knows what else I'm missing from the seasons that were never on Netflix?

I wish I'd noticed as soon as I got the set as a gift, rather than finding out years later when I finally get around to watching the entire thing.

6207775,4,B00HSSZKAW,"This is not a comment on the show.  I like the show. Others do not.  This is a comment on the Blu-Ray Boxed Set.

4 stars instead of 5:
They replaced actual, relevant music in the first season with generic music in Season 1. This was most noticeable to me in Season 1, Episode 8 ""Duped"" which had three iconic songs at broadcast: ""Luck Be a Lady"", ""I Will Survive"", and ""White Rabbit"" which were deleted and replaced with generic filler music.  This detracts from the stories because the music was so important to those stories.  Season 2 and afterward apparently got the music rights straightened out, but season 1 was disappointing in that respect.
The Christmas episodes are out of order with continuity; a carryover from the individual season sets that should have been fixed in the boxed set.
Other than that, this is a fine product with lots of extras.  If you're a fan of the show, this is about as good as it will get.",1515974400,2,926,4.482142857142857

6207801,3,B00HSSZKAW,"My review is for the Warehouse 13: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] in the ""Farnsworth"" box set cover.  The series itself is great, but as another reviewer mentioned,  the low-tech menu on my blu-ray player made me wonder if I'd accidentally bought a pirated copy.  It doesn't look real/professionally designed, being grainy and difficult to navigate.
To begin, each disc asks you to verify which region (in my case US), then gives you the piracy information.  However, then you get a menu similar to what your computer offers-icons only on the left had side of the screen.  No descriptions until you arrow through and select each icon-and sometimes not after that.  Good luck figuring out which episode you left off on!  :( There is also something weird with pause-if you are gone long enough for the menu to time out, you cannot resume playing.  It would only allow me to start over at the beginning- not of the episode, not of the disc-just the option to power up from the region option again.

So, although I would give the show a 5-star rating, the disc design was a 1.  Maybe the DVD version is different or single seasons have a different menu design, but just be aware that this particular set has some technical issues.  However, once you get into the episodes themselves, the image is high quality, the plots fun and interesting, the acting engaging.  I really enjoyed watching the series again and it's nice to rediscover shows I can watch with my 13-year-old niece without teen eye-rolling. :)",1505606400,16,1502,4.756756756756757

6207814,4,B00HSSZKAW,I started watching this and I've noticed that there's a little glitching going on in the playback once in a while. Not sure if it's my dvd player on the computer or not. I decided to watch on a regular dvd player to see if it glitches and so far haven't seen any issues. So maybe it's my computer? I do like this series and it looks like they've added some additional content. Nice that they have it all together in 1 complete set.,1499904000,2,431,4.142857142857143

6207844,2,B00HSSZKAW,"2 stars for the first 2 seasons.

Season 1 took a turn for the worse when they introduced the character Claudia Donovan, who is a mouthy, know-it-all, shallow woman with lots of cliche, attitude, and whining.

For season 3, they decided to add another member to the Warehouse 13 team: a homosexual agent named Steve Jinks. That's when I turned it off. Hollywood pushing their gay agenda again. No thanks. I'm selling the series. Wish I knew this ahead of time.",1485734400,,460,4.666666666666667

6207854,4,B00HSSZKAW,"Amazing series, just be sure you check ALL the DVDs shortly after they arrive. Our first set had several damaged DVDs, although the second set seems to be fine.

The series itself is both clever and very entertaining, and the stories frequently have literary or cultural connections of some kind (For example, Poe's notebook and pen, and Jack the Ripper's lantern were all featured in an episode I watched last night). In addition to the episodes that involve recovering artifacts, there are occasional episodes about the warehouse itself and/or the trouble caused by artifacts that have already been recovered. Many of those are among my favorites.",1482105600,3,649,5.122641509433962

This show has made me laugh out loud for years, and I even made my ugly cry face from time to time as well, especially when it came to Claudia and Steve's relationship. They were two of the strongest and most loveable characters in the whole series.

If you're looking for something to kick back and relax with, this is the show for you. You will laugh for sure, and you might even cry. No matter what, you will not be disappointed.

I am hoping that there is a revival of this series that ended all too soon; even for as
little as a mini-season [like ""X-files"" and ""Heroes""].
Yeah, I know, it was an expensive series to produce---the MAIN reason it ended, ab-
ruptly---but, with the, recent, computer-generated S/F/X advances, IT CAN BE DONE.
I got a great deal on this. I hesitated last time the price dropped---even at TODAY's price,
of $134. I have to pay $40.40 shipping and import-taxes to Germany, but, I ended up
buying it from ENGLAND for $57 [without ANY taxes; and just $3 shipping]. Same region-
free version.

Let's all hop-on the 'Warehouse 13 Train', demonstrate interest, have a revival of the series,
and---[also] like ""X-Files"", and ""Star Trek"" and its many incarnations---a couple of movies!",1454976000,2,855,4.9375

Fantastic dynamics between the cast members, especially the two leads - Myka and Pete.  It was so wonderful to see a show actually not force and shoehorn in an awkward romance between characters just because they were - you know, a guy and a girl (so it must be done).  They had a great family dynamic - sorely missing from the typical rubbish produced on practically every other show.

6207913,2,B00HSSZKAW,"I really wanted to like this show but it just isn't something I would purchase again or recommend anyone else purchase. I love Sci-Fi but don't have the slightest idea how the Sy/Fy channel justified renewing this show for 3 seasons, much less for 5.  So much potential, such weak script writing.  It was kind of like going to a fancy schmansy coffee place with cremes, and sugars, and flavorings and walking out with a tepid, plain coffee.
Did really enjoy seeing some of the guest stars. A fond trip down Amnesia Lane of Sci-Fi shows from the past. I mean who can't get behind seeing Capt. Janeway again?  The only Starfleet Captain to command a Starship in do-me pumps and a wet tee-shirt? Now, THAT was good writing!",1450483200,,720,4.565891472868217
6207914,4,B00HSSZKAW,"Warehouse 13 is a fun lighthearted ride, you will enjoy the characters and the episodes immensely. The heart of the show are the characters and their interactions along with the family dynamic. The greatest weaknesses of this show are the fact that the danger is downplayed in favor of endless humor and pratfalls, the villains are arguably straight out of comic book rather than appropriate menacing with the exception of MacPherson. That's probably one of the biggest reasons this show never got to 7-8 seasons when it easily could have if they had given the series more weight. What defines heroes & 'good guys' are the struggles they must endure and the villains they have to find a way to overcome. Warehouse 13 fails miserably in this regard and the fact that somehow despite having all this training, they never see the bad guys coming. That trick can only work so long, after a while you end up insulting the intelligence of both the characters and the audience watching. So is it a keeper? Yes but I wouldn't get seriously invested in the show, it is guaranteed to let you down.",1449532800,,1087,4.696335078534031
6207915,5,B00HSSZKAW,"Warehouse 13 is a fun unique series that didn't last nearly long enough
Only 5 years much like Haven, Eureka, and the re-boot of  Battlestar Galactica  I see a pattern forming here!
But, that's Sy-Fi channel/Universal  for you anything with legs gets canceled
But, the same network will air WWE Smackdown with a 2hr. block once a week in 2012-2015 when pro wrestling is dead and never ever going back to the epic Monday Night War ratings

The Series was super smart it's very much a updated version of Friday the 13th The Series but, more family friendly
 mostly in part to the whip smart  writing and actors
Eddie McClintock  as  Pete Lattimer  (Eddie has been kicking around Hollywood for a while doing tv guest spots  and was on the full time cast of Stark Raving Mad  great sitcom) This was the series that made him a house hold name
Joanne Kelly  as  Myka Bering  (Joanne much like Eddie has been acting for a while this series also put more of a spot light on her
She is a really a  good actress she is stunning and can act!
The chemistry between Pete & Myka is also a real throwback to a series like Moon Lightning
Newcomer  Allison Scagliotti  as Claudia Donovan  (Is a actress to watch out for she has a great presence on screen) Claudia is a great character over all
Genelle Williams  as  Leena  (Great Canadian actress that after W13 appeared on Bitten) She was wrote out of the show in a terrible way
Aaron Ashmore  as  Steve Jinks  (Aaron outshines his twin brother with this part Steve Jinks is a solid memorable character
Then you have two amazing seasoned actors in
Saul Rubinek  as  Artie Nielsen
CCH Pounder  as  Mrs Frederic
These two actors are simply amazing they have both done so much great stuff i can't talk up either one enough!

There were only 64 episodes which is crazy for a series this good
I already have season 1-3 on dvd I'd love to know why all of a sudden they finally decide to do a proper blu-ray box set
The one major saving grace all the extras from the dvd's are being ported to the blu-ray set A+
But, why now?
I'll wait til it hits around $75.00 bucks even if you held out on any of the previous dvd's the SRP is way to high
Maybe Eureka or Alphas will be next do a proper HD blu-ray set
The series as a whole gets a  9.6/10
the price on this BR box set is criminal though!
I'm pretty sure you can get the German BR Set (Import) for less but, you'll need a region free player",1449446400,4,2418,4.27373068432671

Warehouse 13 Seasons 2-5 DVD are fine & in perfect working order.

6207932,5,B00HSSZKAW,"A great Sci-Fi show. It has the story line that the weird events that people report are due to ""artifacts"" that can make people or things have special occurrences happen to them. It is their job to find the artifact and neutralize it. Then they bring it back to a special building - warehouse 13, there were 12 warehouse before them dating back to ancient Egypt. Getting the artifact is not always easy and of course there are all different types of bad guys who want the artifacts so that they can have the powers the artifacts possess.
The cast is very good and works well together. I enjoyed it when it was on Sy-Fy channel and wanted to see it again.",1440201600,6,654,4.368852459016393

6207955,5,B00HSSZKAW,"I've seen virtually no ""good"" SyFy since the days of Star Trek DS9.  ""Warehouse 13"" is a wonderful breath of fresh air.  A great and ORIGINAL story line that doesn't depend on zombies and vampires (one more of those shows and I'm gonna vomit).  This series has an excellent ensemble cast, some actually engaging scripts and just the right touch of occasional humor.  It doesn't take itself too ponderously serious.  Even if you don't like science fiction, you may like this.  One word of caution:  the story lines build from episode to episode, so you really need to watch them in order.",1434067200,6,587,4.696078431372549

6208018,5,B00HSSZKAW,"I bought Warehouse 13 as a chance because my partner and I had enjoyed Eureka, but where I found Eureka rather quickly got stale and formulaic, this show just grew with passion and entertainment. Initially I did not gel with the two main characters and I found Pete to be irritating and Myka rather dull, however with the development of the series I really grew to love them. However the real stars of this show are the wonderful and brooding Saul Rubinek who plays the part of Artie as if it were himself and I loved him for this. The other real shining light here is of course Allison Scagliotti playing Claudia, whose mildly acidic and humorous dialogue was so beautifully written. Also worthy of note is the gentle character Steve played by Aaron Ashmore, who does a great job of playing a young gay man with out resorting to being camp or stereotypically pathetic. It is so nice to have a good gay character in a show like this and the jokes about his sexuality are insightful and amusing.

The seasons are well constructed, but leaving the final season in only six episodes was a brutal cut that I do not understand. I can see that they wanted to end the series on a high and the final episode was very moving and wonderfully written, but why only six episodes? They could have had some real development with the season bad guys, but maybe quick and over was the best way rather than dragging out the suffering of some of the characters involved that we as viewers really love.

The box set is brilliant, with lots of extras and plenty of disks, what does strike me as strange though is why the extras are spread out all over the place meaning that if you want to search through them, you are swapping disks every ten or so minutes. However the quality of the menus and the quality of the play back make this set a great addition to any DVD shelf.

Eureka was good, but it did not make the audience fall in love with the flawed, but very human characters. The cast and crew of this show have a great deal to be proud of with this show and that comes through in the DVD. Well worth buying and when I got it, it came at a great price. For those of you who love the genre of Sci-Fi, there are so many in jokes in this series and also a great many actors from other shows popping up too.",1416614400,47,2289,4.293981481481482

6208035,5,B00HSSZKAW,"Stumbled onto a flaky series with an outlandish premise and marginally bearable characters.  By the end of episode 4, it was our default viewing choice.  The streaming service elected not to carry Season Five in a timely manner, so we bought the set.  Usually commentary adds nothing to the viewing pleasure, and series cancelled before their time do a very poor job of wrapping up.  Neither, I'm happy to say, holds true in this case.  It's cheaper to buy the seasons one at a time; it's also cheaper to go to a theme park and only ride one attraction.  The package is worth the extra money.",1404864000,27,592,4.537735849056604
6208036,5,B00HSSZKAW,Great show! Like the whole series in the box set. Will miss the show.,1404432000,,69,4.0
6208037,5,B00HSSZKAW,"Warehouse 13 is one of those TV series that don't make as much sense if you miss episodes. It has a definite beginning, a long list of story lines which thread together to make a linear tapestry, a great ending and a very touching closure. So it must be taken as a whole.

We watched every original episode in order, stretched out over what seemed like endless years, but by the time we bought this DVD set a lot of the early detail was blurry. The DVDs have the advantage of allowing the viewer to self pace their watching, backtrack for details and take in the series as a freshly coherent experience.

These DVDs play well, have no problems loading and have abundant bonus material, including commentary for a number of the episodes. I did find a broken hyperlink to a 'more' section on one of them and had to flip through the scenes from the 'play all' link to get to the next show but that was a minor glitch.",1403913600,39,914,4.3391812865497075
6208038,5,B00HSSZKAW,"Why would people give a show a bad rating based on some bundled package price that hasn't even been released yet???  People just like to complain and in the process lower the overall rating of great shows like this one.  If you see a low rated review based on price, please move on.  It's not fair that people knock shows based on price, packaging, etc.  THIS IS GREAT SHOW that can be enjoyed by the WHOLE FAMILY.  A RARE thing in today's tv world.  If you like movies like Indiana Jones and such, you will like this.  Don't listen to the complainers, try season one, you'll be hooked.",1403568000,5,586,4.37037037037037

Extremely sorry to see either series end, but i'm really grateful that Mrs Fredericks finally got to get rid of that horrible pink suit.  Forward and backward in time and she's stuck in that suit.

I'm just glad that both series cleaned up all the lines and people were allowed to become happy with relationships and everybody is well.  But being from Cleveland, I'm really going to miss Pete.",1400630400,8,486,4.604651162790698
6208045,5,B00HSSZKAW,"This, in my opinion is one of the best tv shows of all time. It has all the elements. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and holds your attention through every single episode. I am very sad to see it end after only 5 seasons and am further disappointed that there were only 6 episodes of season 5. But as much as I loved the show, I'm not about to pay $199, $109, or even $89 and change, when I could buy each season separatly for a total of $70.75 as a prime member. The box is nice, but just not worth the extra cost. With all that being said, I give the show a five star rating and the complete series purchase price a 2 star rating. I do, however plan to purchase the entire series, if it becomes available on blu ray. I also highly recommend buying the entire 5 seasons, as it is one of those shows that you will find yourself enjoying over and over again.",1400457600,5,863,4.023255813953488

The DVD quality is passable, which is to be expected with DVDs, and the box that they come in is made of flimsy cardstock. All in all, it's what I paid for and what I wanted. That said, most of the middle discs are scratched on the outer rims, likely because of the packaging. Be sure to check your boxset immediately once you receive it. I let mine sit for about a month before I noticed. The scratches are causing playback issues for certain episodes, and sometimes even resetting me to the Menu mid-episode.
