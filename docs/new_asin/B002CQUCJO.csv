8364333,1,B002CQUCJO,"PHILO VANCE:  I expected a mystery movie and all I got was an E-book.
  This is why I was dissappointed in my purchase.",1354492800,3,119,4.086956521739131
8364334,1,B002CQUCJO,"As other reviewers have said, this is not a movie. It is only a reading of a story on a DVD. There are no images.

The question then is....Why does this still come up when I search on Amazon for 'Philo Vance Movies'?

Until this issue is resolved, I must assume Amazon is intentionally trying to scam its customers.",1336435200,3,315,4.322033898305085
8364335,1,B002CQUCJO,"Imagine my surprise, when I put this on expecting a movie, and all that came out was talking.  There was no picture, just talking, like a radio show.  I'm a little afraid to buy any more movies, especially the old ones.  This is the first time anything like this has happened.  I hope it doesn't happen again.",1323648000,8,309,4.368421052631579
8364336,1,B002CQUCJO,"Was not impressed with the writing and less impressed with the presentation. Boreing and not to my taste as a mystery. I take part of the blame; as I thought I was getting a Van Dine Movie rather than a poorly written pastche. A waste of money and time artfully disguised as a movie but instead, a glossy disappointment. Many thanks for the lesson ensuring that I read your site ads with more care.",1313452800,9,398,4.391891891891892
8364337,1,B002CQUCJO,I was under the impression that this was a DVD movie. It was a DVD where I had to read it like a book.  It did not say that on the item when I purchased it.,1303430400,16,156,3.3333333333333335
