The real gem here is the extra short feature.  It's called Be My King and is one of unsung comedy hero Lupino Lane's funniest romps.  In the 60s my dad bought us a ton of great 8mm silent comedies from Blackhawk Films and he got a condensed version of this - re-titled S'Two for the Pot, and my family and I loved it.  At last, it's on DVD - and it's the entire short.  Buy this disc.",1454630400,3,555,4.101851851851852

7858213,4,630398777X,"I saw this movie when I was like 10 years old. I like it so much I saw it three more times. After that I read the book, which was okay, but I liked the movie better. Hugo Stigliz does a great Robinson Crusoe. The whole film is narrated in first person by the main character ( since there is no other human being to talk with until Friday shows up at the end of the movie! ) There was a sequel to this movie which was more action oriented with the pirates and all that stuff. It was good too, but I liked this one better...even more than Tom Hanks CASTAWAY, which was more realistic, but not fun at all.",1066608000,4,602,3.9834710743801653
