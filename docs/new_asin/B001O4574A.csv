3726601,1,B001O4574A,"Some good location shots but a weak screenplay and unbearably bad acting make this a failure for Otto Preminger. It was, however, watchable from a curiosity standpoint concerning how bad can a great director fail. There are some interesting ties to the problem of terrorism that fill today's headlines.",1428019200,,302,5.183673469387755

3726604,4,B001O4574A,"Palestinian terrorist kidnap five young rich girls (only one of whom is Jewish) with demands that short propaganda films they make be shown on television in several European countries and the United States.  Every time one of the films is played in all four countries a girl is released unharmed with the next movie--if it isn't played then a girl will be delivered dead along with the next film.

Two of Otto Preminger's best films were Anatomy of a Murder, a courtroom thriller where the guilt or innocence of the accused murderer was completely beside the point--Preminger wanted to show how a murder trial works and how guilt or innocence isn't as important as having the right attorney and Advice and Consent which did much the same thing with American politics,using a senate confirmation hearing to examine how government works without any respect whatsoever to who might be right or wrong which is something that plays little part in the process.

Otto Preminger tried to do much the same thing for terrorism with Rosebud.  The Palestinians terrorists are depicted as human beings rather than cartoon villains which is brave for a movie coming out of Hollywood in 1975--if they aren't particularly sympathetic neither are the spoiled rich girls that they kidnapped.  But the worthiness or not of the Palestinian cause doesn't matter--the Palestinians are being financed and used by someone who doesn't really care about them or their cause and a British CIA operative (Peter O'Toole) is being used not because he's on the side of right but because a billionaire industrialist was able to pull strings on behalf of his kidnapped granddaughter.

The politics are surprisingly sophisticated in Rosebud, which results in depictions where nobody ends up looking very good.  The Palestinians are pawns to a financier who wants to create a greater Islamic caliphate across historical Arabia, which should sound familiar to people familiar with the goals of Osama Bin Laden and Isis--but the Palestinian people themselves he could care less about.  The American president was going to support playing the first film until the ambassador from Israel intervened--afterwards he punted responsibility to the networks to give himself political cover.  The Israelis are using the kidnapping as an excuse to go after a man they blame for being the leader and chief financier of anti-Israel terrorism--but their belief that military operations can wipe out terrorism turns out to be badly misplaced.

Given the events of the last 20 years Rosebud has turned out to be an amazingly prescient film which is all the more surprising when you consider the fact that it was a critically reviled box office bomb at the time of its original release--something most folks in Hollywood probably didn't shed a tear over given its subject matter and Preminger's choice to not demonize the Palestinian Liberation Army.  Rosebud seems like it might have been influenced more than a little by Costa-Gavras political thrillers from the period, but the idealistic Gavras always took sides in his films which I imagine the far more cynical Preminger found naive.

When Hollywood movies dealt with terrorism in the 1970's it tended to be in mindless entertainments like Skyjacked and Black Sunday whose politics were either simplistic or non-existent--so Otto Preminger deserves a great deal of credit for trying to make a serious film on the subject, even if it turned out to be the kind of movie that no one really wanted to see.  Rosebud doesn't have much in the way of surface thrills but it's a very interesting film just the same, and even if it doesn't rank among Otter Preminger's best it deserves a lot more respect than it was given back in 1975.

3726605,2,B001O4574A,"Nowhere near as bad as I was led to believe by Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide. Still, it does deteriorate sharply toward the end. The rescue scene is comical.",1415318400,,156,4.607142857142857
3726606,3,B001O4574A,"I am a HUGE fan of Peter O'Toole, and up until the other day, I had never even heard of this film, let alone seen it.  I had to purchase it immediately and watch it.

Unfortunately, it is pretty low-budget, and seemingly, a majority of the money they did have went to the salary of O'Toole and Richard Attenborough's two brief cameos.

Nonetheless, it is a treat to see a mid-career O'Toole fighting terrorists in a rather prescient film about international terrorism from the Middle East.

Apparently, Robert Mitchum was originally cast in the lead but was either fired or walked (depending on who's telling the story) a week into filming, due to conflicts with the director, Otto Preminger.  O'Toole stepped in, suffering at the time from acute intestinal problems, which eventually led to the removal of most of his intestines.  Luckily, the part did not require any of the trademark flash-and-fury of O'Toole's more active roles (Lawrence, Henry II, etc.), and he was able to remain pretty low-key throughout, and still manage to be compelling and tell the story well.  While Mitchum could easily have been as low-key, I can't imagine him being nearly as interesting to watch.

Bottom line: no great filmmaking here, but a curious and fun little oddity for the faithful O'Toole fan.",1393372800,3,1286,4.894009216589862
3726607,3,B001O4574A,"Peter O'Toole is always fun to watch, but it is obvious in the extreme that this movie was written by the director's son.  For a movie about kidnapping and terrorism it is weirdly devoid of any suspense.

3726610,1,B001O4574A,"Why did you do it, Otto? A bad screenplay by his son (with GYPSY ROSE
LEE, a brilliant woman) about terminally bad Palestinian terorists (even FOX TELEVISION wouldn't dare use characters so ridiculous). It was shot in 1975, starring PETER O'TOOLE and RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH. The dreaded
SKIDOO looks like a masterpiece compared to that piece of sheer amateurism.
