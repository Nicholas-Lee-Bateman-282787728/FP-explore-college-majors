5381213,5,B00A3IPC4I,I am in love with this movie. I'd give it an infinity amount of stars. This movie moved me in so many ways. It really touches your heart. I cried a lot but there are funny parts in the film too. The entire cast did a phenomenal job. Lots of love. Can't wait to bring it home to watch with my family.,1420329600,3,299,3.838709677419355

5381217,5,B00A3IPC4I,"I thought this was brilliantly done. It's a great insight to children suffering from a life threatening illness. I laughed when, uh, it's been a few days since I've watched this... his ' friend ' answered the question, ' Why does God make kids sick ' or something like that, and he answered, ' I don't know, because he secretly is evil and likes to torment kids ' .... lol hilarious the way he said it. This had so much to it; even though, I don't believe I'd condone one of the last things needing to be done in life as smoking, and drinking. I honestly don't know why those are burned into peoples minds as being these wonderful little things we need to do before we die. Try climbing a mountain or something, or something within your reach. What do parents or does society teach children now days. How to have sex, smoke and drink? That's messed up....
ah well, they were kids, as they were, and I think this movie was very well done.",1498262400,,937,4.329545454545454

5381219,5,B00A3IPC4I,"This is the first movie I have reviewed and wished there was an option for 4.5 stars. In the end, as you see, I opted for a 5-star rating since I was forced to select either the 4 or the 5. It is a wonderfully packaged movie that ponders questions, I believe, that we all wish we could answer, but cannot. Questions that only a supreme-being (for me that would be God) can answer. My greatest fear in life, or death, is being buried alive. It seems I am rambling, so let me just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, although there are periods when it seems to drag. Perhaps this movie is a bit life life itself, in that it has periods that we wish it would end; and, conversely it has moments where we don't want it to end.",1496361600,,728,4.133802816901408

It was a good story to watch before bedtime - thoughtful, realistic and very moving w2ithout relying on the tear-jerk reflex. I'm not sure how may children of this age, in this situation, are actually capable of dealing with the the cessation of life in such a philosophically and emotionally mature manner, but if you can get past that, this is a beautiful story about a very courageous and very beautiful human being.",1479254400,,489,4.620689655172414

It's possible to create a lasting legacy that influences the lives of others even after you're physically gone from this Earth. Why would someone want to create a legacy? Well, I know that those who changed human civilization either created services or pushed for new ideas that altered how we lead our daily lives. This film is one of those created products that will influence how you lead your future life.

Did not read the description or reviews before clicking in.  But I am sure glad I did!  What a great story.  It's the story of a young boy and his friend, both with terminal cancer, told from the young boy's point of view.  It is sad in parts, but I would not call it a sad film, overall.  It does show how children deal with the terminal diagnosis and how they try to make the most of their lives before they die.  I had never heard of this film before, so it was a happy accident that I ran across it.  This really is a movie you don't want to miss, or you will be missing out.  Well acted, well cast,  withan inevitable ending, but a journey worth taking.  It does make you think.",1474761600,5,808,4.050632911392405

5381275,5,B00A3IPC4I,"This is a serious film about a serious subject.  The subject is pediatric cancer.  Before the starting up of the film, the fiomakers went to John Hopkins University to find out about the subject matter.  World Wide Motion Pictures is also donating a part of the proceeds to research at John  Hopkins.  They also had many of the young patients read the book the film is based on and told them they would only continue with their consent which they did stating that they want the people to know what it is like for them.  The story revolves around two young men with terminal cancer: Sam (Robbie Kay) and Felix (Alex Etel).  What is different is that their story is told from their point of view.  It is an uplifting story and although sad in some aspects, it is not a sad film.  They themselves are not downtrodden but even with their knowledge of the course of events of the future, they are upbeat and are looking to live their lives to the fullest that they can.  They are asked by their tutor if they know how to live forever since they are aware of what is happening to them,  They create their ""bucket lists"" of things they want to do before it is too late for them.  Sam brings up questions throughout the story of ""Questions Nobody Answers"" like where do you go when you die?  Does it hurt when you die?  You get the message.  This is how they live forever.

I mean, cigarettes in a children's cancer ward? This is not funny. It is not comic relief.
I'm not sure of the intended audience but I do not think it is for people who have experience with leukemic patients, regardless of their ages. OTOH, those that have no clue about the destructiveness of this disease, particularly for children, might gain some insight as long as they take some of the stunts with an understanding that over-exaggeration is necessary to get the point across.
