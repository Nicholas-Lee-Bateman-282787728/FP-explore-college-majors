8668328,4,B00LVANL18,This German DVD of The Giant of Marathon is far better than other DVDs out there of this title. But a word of warning. The English language track is not available as an audio set up. You must go into the Extras and select it from there. Good color and widescreen transfer and the film itself is one of Steve Reeves best.,1464393600,,320,4.17741935483871
