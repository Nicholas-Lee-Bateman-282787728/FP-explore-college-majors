Tried to get refund but they will not because I opened cd.

8684787,1,B00OTZN3Q0,NOT IN DESCRIPTION WHEN I PURCHASED BUT THIS DVD FROM THIS SUPPLIER  DOES NOT WORK ON MOST US DVD PLAYERS.  DO NOT PURCHASE COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!,1486166400,,145,4.76
8684788,5,B00OTZN3Q0,"This was one of the more informative DVDs that Caesar has put out in my opinion. Apart from his mastering leadership six DVD volume which I also on, it felt to me like this one had a different producer. This one felt like they went the extra mile to make it the most teaching tool on the subject of socialization Caesar has put out yet. Highly recommend!",1444003200,7,354,4.298507462686567

8684790,5,B00OTZN3Q0,"I'm glad I got it.  He covers a number of techniques that were applicable, and when combined with my PAWS trainer recommendations, I think we are on the way to giving our  Coton greater confidence.  There are a number of situations covered, and some helpful ideas.  Yes, I wanted more, but nothing replaces a a local dog behaviorist who will work specifically with you and your dog.",1428451200,8,382,4.656716417910448
