8223362,5,B000WGWZYG,"This is one of the real gems in an eight DVDs Time-Life collection of classic country music performances from Grand Ole Opry. This disc includes hitmakers such as Johnny Cash (singing ""Big River""), Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton (""Joshua""), Don Gibson (""Oh, Lonesome Me"") and Porter Wagoner (""Green Green Grass Of Home"").  Other highlights include Bill Anderson, early in his career, singing ""Po' Folks,"" and a clean-shaven Willie Nelson singing ""Mr. Record Man"" (clearly uncomfortable with the by-the-numbers backing by the TV studio house band...) and Chet Atkins dazzling guitar work on ""Yakety Axe.""

This disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans. The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand."" The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, the way it used to be. This collection is a true gift -- highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1197158400,10,1251,5.127450980392157
