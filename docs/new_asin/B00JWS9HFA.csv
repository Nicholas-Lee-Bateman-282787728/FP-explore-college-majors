8654203,5,B00JWS9HFA,"I think it's a story about an addict whose stuck in a vicious cycle and wants off but is powerless over its control. Beautifully put together in Canada (Cole Harbour Nova Scotia) with only a $5,000 budget to produce a 2014 opus that major studio heads should pay attention to. Part silent film part poem part feature film and part lucid dream but all unforgettably fanfkntastic! This is the Eraserhead of the 21st century and one of the most memorable films of 2014, even though it was made in 2012.

Seth Smith is no joke and I can't wait to see what he does next. And Chik White goes for the gusto and his performance is Oscar worthy. This movie is for true cinephiles only and those looking for some amazing art.",1442793600,,715,4.416666666666667
