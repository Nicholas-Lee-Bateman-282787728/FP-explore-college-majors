7841953,5,6303222803,Jeff Smith does it again with his fascinating inclusion of very interesting historical facts and cooking yummy recipes!  The recipes in this program are from different early American cookbooks from the late 1700's to 1824 and since there were no measurements included Jeff has tested them himself and come up with the necessary measurements!  He always makes everything so much fun and so interesting!  This is another outstanding video from Jeff Smith!,1168041600,,453,5.263888888888889
