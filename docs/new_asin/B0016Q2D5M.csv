3163901,2,B0016Q2D5M,"While Journey to the Center of the Earth will readily appeal to its target audience of youngsters and the easily impressed, its ridiculous story won't earn the respect of any longtime Jules Verne fans. The jokes alternate between rather amusing and blatantly failed, but the creative implementation of 3D effects pleasantly surprise, balancing out the whole Journey into a much more palatable affair.

Everyone knows you can't travel to the center of the Earth. Everyone except for publicly criticized science professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), who journeys to the mythical ""world within a world"" to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of this brother. Accompanying him is his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and their pretty mountain guide Hannah (Anita Briem) who will join in his fantastic adventures in a lost land of terrifying creatures and prehistoric danger.

Glowing hummingbirds, magnetic floating rocks, and giant carnivorous plants may sound pretty silly, and that's because they are. However, when such creations are thrown into a 3D movie they become spectacular moments of visual brilliance. Except perhaps the floating rocks. But Journey does well in its main reason for existence, and generates an ample amount of creative uses for its medium. From things jumping out of the screen, to more things jumping out of the screen, Journey wastes no opportunity to throw every manner of object or deadly creature at its audience, resulting in an abundance of visual stimulation and a noticeable absence on solid storytelling. At least the former was expected.

The true ""Verneian"" will be dismayed to learn that little remains familiar between this latest adventure to the Earth's core and the original novel. And while it may be unfair to compare it to the book or even the 1959 film, director Eric Brevig's vision often feels like an excuse to use a famous title rather than a sincere adaptation. Goofy comedy replaces earnest, though farfetched, explanations and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects. Odd musical bouts aside, the '59 version utilizes a human antagonist for an extra layer of depth on a film already submerged deep within the Earth's crust, and a race for discovery accompanies the challenge of survival. This new Journey substitutes in a young boy for a young man, a bumbling scientist for a genius professor, and an animated avian for an Icelandic handyman, but at least the female protagonist remains, this time in the form of a mountain guide. Unfortunately all elements of drama and romance take a backseat to the outlandish action and phosphorescent birds.

If curiosity (or the kids) gets the better of you and you must take this Journey, make sure you see it in 3D. Otherwise, once the story rapidly tires, the only thing you'll be able to fall back on is the headrest of your theater chair.

3163907,4,B0016Q2D5M,"A boring professor (Brendan Fraser), unable to maintain a moderate class size, soon finds himself on a field trip to the center of the Earth.  The inconvenience of baby-sitting his snotty nephew (Josh Hutcherson) does not deter him from learning what happened to his brother Max.  In Iceland they learn that brother Max was a Verniansomeone who believes that Jules Vernes work was nonfiction.  While trying to retrieve a sensor, a sudden storm forces the professor, nephew, and guide into a cave just as the entrance collapses, trapping them in an abandoned mine.  The mine proves to be the long way to the center of the Earth.
A few elements from the novel were misused here in ways the author never intended.  The use of the 3D gimmick hindered the visual effect of the movie due to the inherent need of the process (and filmmakers) to literally throw things straight at the camera/audience.  This effect didn't work during the 1950s and it doesnt work any better here.
Other than that, the best this film can claim is that it is good harmless fun that doesnt tax the brain.",1517616000,,1076,4.696808510638298

3163938,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Gone are the days of the simplistic action/adventure film, and luckily Journey to the Center of the Earth was of the last treats this genre has given us. The plot and characters are simple, and don't offer a lot, but their simplicity allows for the viewer to be engaged into this world more. Each character is likable, and while the dialogue can be cheesy I find that's part of its charm. The pace is fast and the characters are in constant danger after falling through the Earth. A lot of the thrills and special effects hold up, some more than others, to make this a very enjoyable night in. Brendan Fraser is the king of screaming and being a badass. Plus you get to see him not only punch a plant but use his Hollywood muscles to tear it from the ground! I really enjoyed how Hannah, the main female character, wasn't the stereotypical girl in distress. She actually kicked butt more often than the boys and saved Faser's life on numerous occasions. The 3D in this film is great, if a bit dated. You can tell that some shots aren't as suitable for the 3D format, such as the quick editing in the beginning, but this was made at the beginning of the 3D resurgence so I'll give it a break. Especially since this 3D is better than most Hollywood movies today, because it actually dares to give you the pop out effect on many occasions, and on most of those occasions I found myself giggling with pure bliss in my heart, because the film along with the 3D made me feel like a kid again.",1501891200,2,1486,4.368231046931408
3163939,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Some good ideas, but poorly directed. Acting is very cheesy. A lot of things happen that defy the  laws of physics.

Unfortunately this movie was lacking in comedic writing, or good writing whatsoever. Whether this movie were in 3D, 2D, or 5D would not change the actual quality of the writing and storyline. The big ""mystery"" of the plot is solved halfway through, while the characters continue to meander stereotypically through underground caverns. All that was missing from this predictively below-crust adventure was that Brendan Frasier does not end up marrying the female lead.",1492214400,,641,5.056603773584905

3164078,5,B0016Q2D5M,"The experience of watching Journey to the Center
of the Earth is like taking a deep breath of fresh air.
It harkens back to a time when there were more 3D films
being shot natively.  By this, I mean they were conceptualized
and designed for the format rather than upconverted in
post production.

What's rather odd is that Journey To The Center of the
Earth, as tremendously fun as it is, falls short of being the
perfect 3D action film.  However, when you discover that
most movies currently released on 3D Blu-ray consist of
upconversions, the film somehow manages to rise to the
top of ""must have purchases.""

I'll explain this in a moment.

I don't think the story is unfamiliar --- especially for anyone
who has read Jules Verne novel or watched the spectacular
1959 film this remake is loosely adapted from.  In this
modernized  version, Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan
Fraser) is on a quest to find his lost brother. With his nephew
Sean (John Hutcherson) at his side, they head to Iceland to
explore strange seismic activities that may be their key to
a portal that will transport them to the deepest regions inside
the earth. With the help of a beautiful mountain guide (Anita
Briem) and the Jules Verne book to guide them, the team
soon finds themselves living a real-world science fiction fantasy.

It's rather a shame that a terrific novel and a well-respected
1950s film was ultimately rebranded into a juvenile B-rated
remake that gears itself towards young moviegoers.  However,
that being said, I was awfully surprised as to how much I was
enjoying this popcorn flick, particularly for the fact that it does
come across as a wild, mindless theme-park roller coaster ride
with lots of WOW moments along the way thanks to its abundance
of 3D gimmickry.

By all rights, Journey to the Center of the Earth should have
been the Blue Ribbon prize winner for all the personal standards
I have set on what this format should provide to its audience. The
""In yo' face"" factor is through the roof here as the film certainly
succeeds at exploiting the format by throwing everything it can
towards the viewer.  The intent is certainly evident within the film's
initial first frames as we watch a woodlouse's antenna's poking
itself forward. From that point on, viewers should expect to be
bombarded with objects that include a retractable measuring tape,
a hurled-yo-yo, spilled molecular balls and a fallen flashlight (to
name just a few).  While some may consider the amount of effort
given to these thrown effects as ""cheesy,"" I think it works perfectly
for a film that doesn't seem to take itself very seriously.

So here's the problem:  Journey to the Center of the Earth suffers
from looking dated as far as what the 3D technology should look
like.  Sure, we are only talking about a film that is a few years old,
but for some reason, the quality of the 3D presentation falls just
short of being as incredible as it should.  Overall depth level is good,
but I felt it could have been a bit better. The film's intended 3D effect
work doesn't quite pack its intended punch.  For instance, most of
the more prominently projected objects lose their effectiveness due
to a slight amount of double-imaging as it moves closer to the viewer.
Even intentions to have objects seemingly dance before your face,
such as blown giant dandelion seeds, don't come off as effectively
as they should.

There are traces of ghosting to be seen now and then, but outside of
the protruding effect work, I didn't find it to be a constant problem.

Perhaps the problem lies in the overall murky look of the film which
is something that I am certain is intentional rather than a transfer
problem.  The outdoor scenes look wonderfully crisp, but once the
journey goes inside the cave, towards the center of the Earth, images
become rather subdued and cloudy resulting in a slight loss of detail.
The film's most climatic fast-paced action sequences that involve a
mine car or dinosaur chase, have a slightly smeared look to it.  In all,
I am rather disappointed that with all the effort put into creating the
film's beautiful cavernous world, its clarity is somewhat dulled.

The real show stealer here is the film's DTS-HD MA soundtrack which
is perfect in all respects.  This is a powerful, boomy audio presentation
with enough LFE activity to shake the entire floor during the film's seismic
events and action sequences (particularly a dinosaur chase).  Viewers will
find themselves completely immersed in the ambient activity that is
delegated to the rear channels where the subtle nuances of the underworld
(such as various drips and creaks) are effectively conveyed.

Journey to the Center of the Earth arrives as a single 3D/2D Blu-ray
disc housed in lenticular packaging.  In addition to commentary by
Brendan Fraser and Director Eric Brevig, there are 20 minutes of
family-friendly special features that include How to make a dinosaur
drool; A World Within our Own that looks at historical theories about
what lies below our planet's crust; Being Josh which profiles 12-year-old
costar Josh Hutcherson.  The disc also comes with an $8 coupon off
the admission of Journey 2 The Mysterious Island which opens in
theaters this February.

I have such a love/hate relationship with this 3D Blu-ray release of
Journey to the Center of the Earth.  I had never watched this film
previously, had low expectations going in, and it turned out that I
enjoyed watching this onscreen adventure more than any other 3D
film in recent memory.  It really captures that essence of being on
a theme park ride, placed in the middle of the action, with all this neat
stuff being thrown towards you.  For me, it's exactly what 3D is all
about.

The problem is that based on the film's low-budget effects, dulled
look and 3D technology that was about to be improved upon by
James Cameron, the film falls just short of being as tremendous
as I had hoped.

Still, somehow, Journey to the Center of the Earth gets placed on
my list of ""must purchase"" Blu-ray releases.  If you are buying into
the format for that 3D WOW factor, this just happens to be a film that
delivers it.  This makes for a perfect family film whose 3D gimmickry
will induce screams of joy from the kids.  What more could you ask for?",1453075200,,6274,4.782205746061168

This disc contains both (2D & 3D) versions on one Blu-ray disc. I do agree that this is a very impressive 3D Blu-Ray DVD movie, however there is considerable video noise in the form of white dots almost like snow or a fine mist that almost obscures the picture at several points near the start of the movie, lasting for the first 20 min of the movie intermittently. This is very annoying especially in 3D and is still quite noticeable even with the noise filters built into my TV at max. I recommend buyer be ware.

Buy another form of this movie and that's probably why the Blu-ray 3D (non-combo) only movie is much more expensive!!!!",1448668800,,803,4.462585034013605

3164163,3,B0016Q2D5M,"The French novelist Jules Verne (1828-1905) probably made a bigger contribution to the world of science fiction than any writer who ever lived, yet the cinema has most always treated him rather shabbily.  With the exception of Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" movies have handed us a range of silly, often low-budget permutations of ""A Trip to the Moon,"" ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" ""Mysterious Island,"" etc., and almost a dozen variations on ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" the most-famous previous film version starring Pat Boone, acting and singing.

Now, we've got New Line's 2008, 3-D production of ""Journey"" starring Brendan Fraser, hamming it up in full Indiana Jones, tongue-in-cheek mode as though he were still looking for mummies to dispatch.  Well, at least he doesn't sing at us.  Actually, this new ""Journey"" is a perfectly serviceable rendering of the Verne story for children, although adults may find it a rather juvenile, scatterbrained affair, with many of its shots intended more to show off the 3-D process than to further the story line.  For a pure, Saturday-afternoon, children's matinee adventure, it can have its moments, so the film is not a total loss.  Just don't expect to take any of it seriously, which must have poor Verne turning over in his grave.

There are several reasons why the movie didn't work for me, the primary one being that I am not of the age demographic the filmmakers were trying to reach.  Here are a few specifics:  First, Verne set his story in his own time, the mid 1860s.  The current filmmakers set their story in the present, the better to reach a younger audience for whom historical dramas might be a turnoff.  Either that or the filmmakers couldn't afford the period costumes and sets; I don't know.  Second, Verne's characters were a middle-aged professor; the professor's nephew, presumably in his late teens or early twenties because he marries his sweetheart when they return from their adventure; and an Icelandic man who serves as their guide as they climb down a volcano shaft.  The filmmakers, though, give us Brendan Fraser as the professor, a thirteen-year-old boy (Josh Hutcherson) as the nephew, and a beautiful young woman (Anita Briem) as the guide.  Again the filmmakers are targeting the youth market.  Finally, we get a whole slew of actions and special effects that the filmmakers intended specifically for the 3-D production, things that pop up about every ten seconds and have little or nothing to do with the story line or characters.  Be prepared for yo-yos, tape measures, balls, rocks, and all matter of debris to come flying off the screen at you.  And the fact that the events in the story are far more preposterous than anything Verne could have invented is probably beside the point; we have come to expect exaggerated theatrics in today's adventure movies.  Besides, Eric Brevig directed the film as his first big-screen directorial effort after spending most of his Hollywood career as a visual effects supervisor.  So what did you expect from the movie but a world of visual effects?

Otherwise, the movie retains some semblance of Verne's plot.  We do have the professor, the nephew, and the guide.  We do have the volcano in Iceland they climb (or fall) down.  We do have all the typical hazards for which movies like this have prepared us:  man-eating plants, man-eating fish, and anything-eating dinosaurs.  You know, the usual.

Don't expect anything to make sense, though; the filmmakers have calculated every calamity that befalls the trio to highlight some new 3-D effect.  If you're not watching in 3-D, much of the goings on look seriously dumb.  There's even a roller-coaster ride in mine carts down an old mine shaft, a ride similar to the one in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (and there's more ""Temple of Doom"" action toward the end of the movie when the trio slide down a mountain).

Frankly, I preferred the old Pat Boone rendition of the story better than this one; it actually had more realistic thrills, if you can believe it.  This movie is more like a Disneyland ride, the emphasis on the glitter and glamor of the CGI effects rather than on any kind of tension, suspense, or excitement.  Worse, much of the computer graphics aren't too convincing.  For example, the trio's raft venture on an underground ocean didn't seem too real to me, nor did some of the creatures they encountered.  Add in a flock of cutesy birds that seem to have flown in from a Disney cartoon, and you get a film that kids will undoubtedly enjoy at the expense of more than a few parents.

Oh, and in the best tradition of adventure movies everywhere, the heroine sheds more and more of her clothing as the story goes on.  But don't worry:  It gets a PG rating.

Video:
New Line provide two versions of the movie on a single, dual-layer BD50 disc in VC-1, both versions in 1.85:1 ratios that reproduce the film the way audiences watched the movie in a motion-picture theater.  The difference is that one of the versions is in 2-D and the other is in 3-D.

The 3-D presentation is wonderfully pleasing in its dimensionality and made the few minutes I stuck with it something of a kick, even if it seemed more dimensional than real life.  I mean, just look about.  Do objects in the space around you really have as much depth as they appear to have in a 3-D movie?  However, as I had found with the standard-definition 3-D version I watched several days earlier, I couldn't stick with it for long because of the 3-D cardboard-and-cellophane glasses.  They were just too uncomfortable to deal with for very long.  Now, here's the thing:  If you don't normally wear eyeglasses, the 3-D glasses are simply an annoyance on the nose.  But if you do wear eyeglasses for distance, as I do, the 3-D glasses are downright impossible.  I tried wearing them outside my regular glasses and got nowhere.  They wouldn't stay put.  Next, I tried wearing them under my own eyeglasses; again, no dice.  They actually hurt.  Worse, I couldn't get them to focus properly in either location, and after a short time I started to get a headache.  I remember having this same problem several years ago with ""Spy Kids 3-D,"" and I resorted to cutting the cardboard 3-D glasses apart and taping them to my eyeglasses.  Even that didn't work, however, so I didn't try it this time.  Instead, I watched the movie in regular 2-D.

In 2-D and 3-D, the first thing I noticed about the colors was that they had an oddly purple tinge to them, no doubt a result of the red-and-green colors used in the 3-D process.  These colors looked more than a bit washed out, too, no doubt another condition of the 3-D cinematography.  The second thing I noticed was that the image looked slightly soft in both versions, even though the Blu-ray high definition was significantly sharper than in SD.  Then I remembered that the filmmakers had shot the movie using digital 3-D cameras, so it is possible to attribute the lack of ultimate focus to the digital photography.  In any case, the disc's HD video quality did not impress me in 2-D, and in 3-D it was too hard for me to watch and too hard for me to focus.  I couldn't win with this one in any case.

Audio:
New Line's standard-definition edition of the movie came with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and I really expected more of the high-definition Blu-ray.  Alas, what with cramming two versions of the movie onto a single disc, it looks like the studio ran out of room.  Or I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt; I don't know.  What I do know is that any modern adventure needs the best possible audio.  Instead, we get ordinary Dolby Digital 5.1, which does about what we would expect of it and little more.  It displays a good dynamic response, strong impact, and an abundance of rear-channel surround effects, like creepy underground noises, bang, booms, creaking, and cracking.  There were times when it also displayed a small degree of harsh, edgy distortion, but these times were thankfully few.

Extras:
Besides making the movie available in two separate dimensional formats, New Line provide a few other items as well.  First up, there's an audio commentary by star Brendan Fraser and director Eric Brevig.  After that, there are three featurettes:  ""A World Within Our World,"" ten minutes of discussion on various hollow-Earth theories through the ages; ""Being Josh,"" six minutes following actor Josh Hutcherson around the set; and ""How to Make a Dino Drool,"" three minutes on the making of that particular effect.

In addition, the package contains four pairs of 3-D glasses; a digital copy of the film, compatible with iTunes and Windows media devices; twenty-one scene selections; bookmarks; a guide to elapsed time; a slipcover with a 3-D holographic picture on the front; English and Spanish spoken languages; Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
If your idea of a good movie is an amusement-park ride, then ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a good movie.  For kids, it should be great fun.  For this adult, however, it was something of a chore, in 2-D or 3-D, and not even the high definition helped that much.",1433808000,2,9200,4.779607346421786

3164253,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I loved reading the book, ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" when I was younger, it was an amazing story and it really got my imagination going!

This movie seemed to try to do the same thing.  We have a boring scientist played by Brendan Fraser who wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and prove that he wasn't crazy, and his nephew stops by for a visit.  Together they end up going on a trip that is essentially a replica of the one in Jules Vernes famous book.

The story is great, the acting is good, and the actors all put in a great performance, plus the special effects are terrific as well.  My only question is, when the T-Rex came upon the nephew character, it was in the middle of what looked like a barren wasteland.  So... what was this thing eating?  What was it living off of?  I didn't see any animals there that it could eat to stay alive, or even any plants in that area either.  It's just a little inconsistency that kinda had me scratching my head.

But this is still a great movie that families and fans of the original novel will really enjoy!",1415404800,,1074,4.272277227722772

His scientific theories rubbished by his eminent colleagues, Professor Trevor Anderson [Brendan Fraser] sets off on a backpacking trip to Iceland to get away from it all with his nephew Sean Anderson [Josh Hutcherson] and local guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson [Anita Briem]. Stumbling across a previously unknown cave system, the explorers soon find themselves journeying deeper and deeper into the earth's core, on a rollercoaster ride into an unknown world populated by man-eating plants, lava lakes, and some seriously hungry dinosaurs.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Jules Verne once said Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real. And director Eric Brevig has done just that, as he has made the fantastic world that Jules Verne imagined come into a near-reality in his film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D. He was able to do this through technological advances made in stereoscopic 3D filming. I believe this was the first live-action film to be shot in 3D during the infancy of 3Ds return. While having the obvious intent of introducing us to what 3D can do and paving the way for the success of the 3D AVATAR, and this film also tells an enjoyable story that does well on its own even without 3D.

There's a lovely visual gag in Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D that sums up what's good about it. We're trapped in a chasm 20 minutes in, and Trevor Anderson [Brendan Fraser] is dangling on the end of a rope in fear for his life. He must be cut loose, or he'll pull everyone else down with him. Snip goes the rope, and he plummets about six inches, getting a light bump on the floor of an old disused mine. It's a big laugh, and such a simple, retro one it leaves you smiling for minutes.

The story is centred on the adventures of the Anderson family. Max Anderson [Jean Michel Par&eacute;] disappeared while on an expedition; he was never found and is assumed dead. The story begins ten years later with Trevor Anderson [Brendan Fraser], Max Andersons brother. He is a geologist, and the university where he works is planning to close down his lab. He has become so focused on his own troubles he had forgotten that he had agreed to spend time with his nephew Sean Anderson [Josh Hutcherson] before he moved away to Canada with his mom. So when Sean arrives, the house is a mess and Uncle Trevor is caught off-guard, having made no plans. Sean Anderson, who didn't want to be there in the first place, is not impressed. Trying to connect, Trevor Anderson decides to go through the box of Max Andersons belongings that Sean Andersons mum had left for him.  Amongst other nick-knacks and gadgets, they come across Max Andersons copy of Jules Vernes A Journey to the Centre of the Earth in which he had documented his final research prior to the expedition that lead to his disappearance. The information they find leads them to believe that Max Anderson had disappeared in Iceland while searching for a passage to the centre of the earth.

They decide to make their own way to Iceland and investigate what happened to Max Anderson. Together with newly met Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson [Anita Briem], the daughter of a scientist Max Anderson knew, they discover that he was searching for what most thought was only a fictitious story, the passage to the centre of the earth ""documented"" in Jules Verne's famous novel. They recruit Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson as a guide and head into the mountains to search for any signs of Max Anderson and his research. A wicked lightning storm  forces them into a cavern to shelter them from the storm, but the storm in its ferocity causes the entrance to collapse behind them. So having no other options the group starts their journey into the earth.

After finding their way to the bottom, or should I say falling their way down to the centre of the earth, they discover a world within the world just like Lidenbrock, the character from Jules Vernes book, had described. It is filled with an assortment of prehistoric creatures and plants, and covered with lakes and rivers. To reach the escape passage they seek, they must battle the harsh environment that surrounds them and all the monstrous creatures that call it home. Will they prevail or will their discovery die with them? To find out, gather your family and join the journey on this great family-friendly adventure, and don't forget your 3D Glasses!

Eric Brevig has hit this one out of the park, as his direction of the cast brings out the chemistry between the characters that plays out well on screen. Brendan Fraser is always a joy to watch on screen and I think the selection of this cast, especially for the three primary cast members, was extremely well done. I really enjoyed watching Brendan Fraser compete with Josh, who's just a teenage boy, for the attention of Anita, and while this could easily turn out to be a little creepy, they aligned the actor's and characters ages and personalities up just right so that it seemed natural. Eric Brevig also found a lot of ways to add to that third dimension of this film without sacrificing the story or character development. The show moves along at a great pace and does a good job of keeping your attention. Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is loosely based on a classic work of literature, but at no point does it take itself too seriously, it will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film is one that you can enjoy by yourself or for a family night, as the show is good clean fun with little to no language.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Both versions of the film are here in full 1080p encoded image quality, with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Depending on which version you're watching, the video tends to be a mixed bag. The 3D video image is outstanding and is also good in the standard 2D versions. Detail was really sharp and the cinema photography was choreographed very well. Director of photography Chuck Shuman deserves recognition for creating such a masterful piece of art work. I do have to complain about the lighting at times where they added some glow to the image in different shades of colour. That just didn't seem to look very natural to me, although it was the intended effect by the director. Other times they took short cuts on set and to me those were noticeable as well. The lighting works somewhat better in the 3D version and looks like a more natural presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I hope nobody has their pitchforks around when I say this, but there's no 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track for this release. Instead, we're given an amazing awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. This is a film that takes a journey to one of the most beautiful and bizarre places (literally) in the world, so it's no surprise that the audio representation for this release gives your whole system a pretty decent workout. There's a nice dynamic range that leaves voices easy to hear, and increases the volume during the action to a loud level that won't make your kids cry thinking their eardrums had burst. There does appear to be a little distortion once in a blue moon, which is kind of disappointing. You'd have to really listen for it, as it's nothing that's consistent by any means, but a high definition audio track should have been available for this release.

3D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Eric Brevig and actor Brendan Fraser: They provide for a jovial atmosphere joke session and quip their way through an otherwise thorough commentary, covering everything from Journey's development to its characters, visual effects, 3D shoot, and scenes that proved more difficult than either man anticipated. As audio commentaries go, this one is decidedly non-essential listening for all but the most pumped-up of fans.

Special Feature: A World Within Our World [2008] [10:08] An ironically shallow look at several leading theories about what lies deep beneath the surface of the Earth. It is the best feature, giving an overview of relevant historic scientific theory regarding the ""hollow earth"" used as the basis for Jules Verne's novel. Narrated by Anita Briem.

Special Feature: Being Josh [2008] [6:00] A day in the life of young Josh Hutcherson's experiences on set. We follow Josh in his trailer and on the set of the film. It's not really a fun watch, but your children might enjoy seeing someone closer to their own age behind the scenes.

Special Feature: How to Make a Dinosaur Drool [2008] [2:47] Features Josh Hutcherson, Eric Brevig and the men responsible for the horrible goop in question, explaining how they made and employed T-rex spittle. Finally, the set includes access to a digital copy of the film, so kids on the run can continue to enjoy the fun.

Finally, the 3D effects are definitely the icing on the cake and if your idea of a treat is having a woodlouse poke its antennae into your near vision, then you are in for a treat. But the best news is a nicely judged script that doesn't come off too aggressive - more gently joshing - and three actors doing the best they can to give it some personality. Brendan Fraser (who also produced) is an impressively unflappable stalwart by now at this running and screaming business, and his relaxed professionalism gives you the instant feeling of being in safe hands. When he tosses Josh Hutcherson some tome about Atlantis at the end, paving the way for another adventure rich with peril and pointy things, and it is a type of 3D film that is an enjoyable repeat viewing. I thought I might hate this film, as I have always been a massive fan of the original 1959 Journey To The Centre Of The Earth film, but I was totally won over and so pleased I have now added this to my Blu-ray Collection and if you want to impress people with a stunning 3D, then this is a very good 3D reference Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

The woman is fairly modestly clothed, shirt and short shorts, but she keeps it all on, and I didn't notice any zoom-ins on parts of her body, or ""checking her out"" in a sexual way.

Movie itself:  entertaining throughout.  Not the best movie ever, but a good family movie night flick.  Good acting, good story line, cool concept, good execution.

3D:  now this is what merits the price.  When I bought my led t.v. on black Friday 2013, I immediately started looking for epic 3D movies.  When you search ""best 3D movies"" on Google, this movie constantly came up.  I took the chance to get awesome scenes.  Literally from within the first 3 seconds of the movie, till close to the end, there's 3D in almost every scene.  Very good 3D effects, among the best I've seen thus far.

Overall: I would recommend this movie due to its overall execution, as stated above.  Im satisfied with my purchase.  Im willing to bet you'll be too.",1390694400,2,825,4.671328671328672

3164388,4,B0016Q2D5M,"We went and saw this movie in the theater when it first came out.  My son was probably five at the time and there were a couple parts that really scared him (the T-Rex and the magnetic rocks).  But now this is one of his favorite movies.

If you like science fiction with lots of adventure, this is a good movie.  Once the three get on their adventure, they encounter all sorts of things such of things such as oversized dinosaurs that are very mean, man eating plants, fish that jump at you and try to kill you, magnetic rocks you have to climb over to get to where you're going, a awesome train ride, and lava.

The movie keeps your interest captured from the first moment to the last.

great movie with exceptional quality, highly recommended for all ages and a blue-ray worth for keeping.",1386201600,,230,4.775
3164401,4,B0016Q2D5M,"The plot is simple enough: a trio of explorers discover an underground realm and they encounter different creatures and plants and terrifying obstacles. The story is nothing to ponder about: there's nothing philosophical or symbolic about it. But it's not trying to make a statement (or trying to be pretentious) about it. Journey to the Center of the Earth is strictly an adventure movie. The characters may be wooden, and the situations may be extremely preposterous, but hey, I did enjoy watching this movie. The special effects looked riveting, though watching it in 2D may have been a very minimal experience compared to the 3D that I could have seen. Still, the effects are marvelous. I did have a problem with the world underneath the earth's surface. The landscapes and creatures looked beautiful, but there weren't a lot of threatening beasts. There were sea creatures, Venus flytraps, and one T-rex: it didn't seem enough.

Anyway, JTTCOTE is a good adventure movie. The acting isn't that great, though Brendan Fraser gives his usual enjoyable performance. I'll say that you can watch this strictly for the visuals, the music, and cinematography. I haven't seen this movie in 3D, but I heard it's better than watching it in 2D. I can't really say myself, but I guess either way is fine.

3164423,5,B0016Q2D5M,"This is a great movie and I just had to write a review after seeing it. I can assure anyone who is looking for a great movie to watch and that is available in 3D ( I love Blu-Ray 3D but the selection is a bit limited )
That this movie is simply tons of fun to watch and enjoy.

The film is lighthearted in nature, and the acting is actually much better then I expected. Kudo's to the Director and to all of the cast. The 3D effects are amoung the best I have seen so far. I have been buying Blue Ray 3D movies and some of them are great stuff to watch, and others are absolutely awful to watch. No plot, worse acting, and no real 3D effects.

( I should add here that when I bought my 3D system, none of the reviews i came across mentioned the difference between passive and active 3D. So I bought an LG 47 inch passive 3D 6200 series TV. It was one of the highest and best ranked TVs.
Later I discovered that Active 3D has significantly better 3d effects. I didn't do my homework.. And nothing was mentioned regarding the 2 different types of 3D available when I was reading through Amazon product specifications either.  I actually was unaware there were 2 different types of 3D at the time. If I could do it again I would definitely buy a Samsung LED TV with Active 3D, and may still do so, while delegating this TV to a different room. But as I wrote above I should have done some research. Actually the LG model I did buy has some pretty good Passive 3D abilities and LG displays are excellent for HD movies also. so I can wait for a bit while pricing points start to drop on all of this 3D tech. As prices always do drop especially on TV systems. )

Anyway I wanted to include the above information because even on my passive 3D system, this film had tons of great special effects flying out of the TV and aiming right for me...  I actually tried to block an image of a small rock that was flying right at me, instinctively.. Pretty amazing for a 3D passive system. I can only imagine what this film would be like with Active 3D tech.

So I highly recommend this film for everyone, its not violent, its not scary! It is very engaging for the type of movie that it is. And it has some suspense filled moments. It has been done with an overall sense of very good Humor throughout the film, and has, of course, the usual but well managed love interest theme going on throughout it.
Getting into the great mood and the upbeat rhythm of this film is easy to do and its a great 3D movie on an early Saturday evening type of movie. It has a really good sound track as well.",1379116800,,2572,4.144288577154309

If you like Brendan Fraser, adventure movies, Jules Verne, or Josh Hutcherson, this is a wonderful movie. It's great for the whole family.

3164461,5,B0016Q2D5M,"Having seen several of the 3d Movies offered, I have to say that this movie was worth the price. It had good amount of action sequences that worked well with the 3d aspect. Several parts had me and my family jumping due to the clever use of effects. The story is a little bland, but I would still buy this over again if I had to. A great family movie.",1369180800,,351,4.0285714285714285

3164472,2,B0016Q2D5M,"We are expected to accept too many unlikely events.  Everything goes impossibly right or impossibly wrong and very unlikely at that.  Even though the characters make really poor judgments, they make it home when they should have been stuck or died in oh-so many ways.  A bit cheesy, too.

I did laugh in some scenes, that were meant to be funny. A weird thing was that eventhough i did think the acting was okay, its werid, when they wanted you to feel emotion, you felt it, it's a little hard to explain.

3164484,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Yes, Brendan Fraser is far from an academy award actor and this silly story has been told quite enough times by now. But just the same, it was good campy fun watching it in 3d at home (our first foray into 3d movies on the new 73"" 3d TV). There were a number of cool 'pop out' scenes to really get you going; in one scene, someone lit a road flare, and while gripping it in hand, they suddenly thrust their hand straight at the viewer, my wife and I both jumped out of the way as it looked so real coming straight out of the screen into your face. In another scene we caught ourselves swatting our arms as these little bird like creatures seemed to infiltrate our living room! Kids would probably really enjoy this experience.

3164489,5,B0016Q2D5M,I give this five stars as the packaging and delivery of the product was sound with no issues. That said it was also a great 3D flick and one of the better ones I've seen. It's a short simple story that you end up wanting more. In that I would give it a three out of five but overall it's a nice purchase if you have a 3D television and want to enjoy it for what it was made to do.,1363219200,,380,3.7037037037037037

It works pretty well on my 55"" Flat Screen, although the colors are somewhat duller than playing it as a 2D.  It comes with 4 sets of cardboard glasses which are small for my adult head.  I cut the ear hooks off a pair and taped on an extension and it worked fine.  Anyway, it is a novelty seeing the 3D, but with the new technology out now, I think you will have to buy the equipment to see it in the future and get an even better experience for it.",1361145600,,580,3.956896551724138

Overall the movie was decent, light hearted and entertaining, the big selling point to Mr seas the 3d, it was clear the movie was directed with the idea of 3d in mind. The look of the 3d was very convincing, and there were several effects that came well out of the screen (I flinched several time because it seemed like something was about to hit me)

I highly recommend this if you want to see a movie fully leverage the capabilities of 3d",1361059200,,556,4.091743119266055

3164511,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Let me get this out the door: Journey to the Center of the Earth is a very cheesy and campy movie. It is has the most clich one-liners, and corny dialogue. Yet, that doesn't stop the movie from being an exhilarating 3D adventure. For those that are fortunate enough to own a 3D TV, the 3D in this movie is very fun. Depth is always there, and there are some fun pop-outs through out the movie (Yes they know they are gimmicky). Within the first minute of the movie, there is an awesome pop-out that stretches way out of the screen. The picture quality is another story, during some scenes, there is a pinkish hue, a blueish hue, and a greenish hue that really takes away from the picture quality. However, if this doesn't bother you, i highly suggest buying this movie. At $14.99, it was a steal. However, I am not sure if this is still the price. I would pick this up if you found it for under $19.99.",1359763200,,902,4.280701754385965

I also found the window violations to be too numerous for me (window violations is a through the window effect where part of the through-the-window object is cut off by the edge of the TV screen) something appears to be between the viewer and the screen but is cut off by the side of the screen).  IT is OK if something is sticking out at me, but when half a person is sticking out at me, it is too distracting.

You certainly have plenty of acting talent. It's too bad it was wasted on such a vapid screenplay. And the sets are colorful. But that's about it! Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching planes land and take-off at an airport. Sure some people may find that exciting, but most people don't.

If I had to sum up this film, I would say it lack's heart. The writer's of the screenplay certainly went out of their way NOT to do, or say, absolutely anything to offend anyone! This is the ultimate perfect film for small children. It's so plain vanilla, parents will have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, for the rest of us, it wasn't marketed as a children's only film!

I don't expect a Jules Verne story to make sense - it's a delightful fantasy. But the versions I remember as a child & teen had very convincing passion and a lot of imagination. Memo to Hollywood: When you make the next remake sometime in the next twenty years, dump the plain vanilla into the compost bin, and take walk on the wild side!

Now we are presented with ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.

Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.

I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.

Now it was time to watch the 3-D version. , I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat.  Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.",1341187200,,1884,4.502941176470588

There were some campy over-the-top action sequences that would normally leave our heroes with shattered vertebra but it all fit in with the type of classic film genre that this movie represented.

The visual effects quality in this film were light and were more TV grade than theatrical film grade but, I'm glad the producers kept the cost of production under control so that this film could by profitable and it looks like, in the world wide box office, it was very profitable.

I also liked how this film had no profanity or gratuitous sex and violence.  This is a very family friendly film that can entertain the kids and their parents.",1338508800,,940,4.777777777777778
3164612,2,B0016Q2D5M,"This movie..wow. The book by Verne was nice, and so was the beginning to this movie. I immediately got a horrible taste in my mouth when I saw them on this silly adventure in the railway cart. It was then that I knew that this movie was not a real adaption or a serious one but rather a spoof either intentional or not.

Rather than going on about how much of a Disney movie it turned out to be with a good beginning, let me go over a few problems I had.

1) When they were going out the water blast at the end, are you seriously telling me that they were perfectly aimed at the top to where they didn't clip the side and go tumbling up?
2) The kid stored a prehistoric bird in his bag and it didn't die of either cramped space or something similar? You hide a bird in the small pocket of a bag and you tell me what happens.
3) The graphics are worse than a movie made about 12 years before in Jurassic Park. Really?

There are many more complaints. The 2 stars are for the beginning of the movie and the beautiful actress who, in real life, would NOT have fallen for the main character in such a short amount of time.

Really, if you are a kid then maybe this movie might suffice. If you are an adult then no, this movie won't do. It feels rushed and we as viewers should demand better. How is it that Jurassic Park had better graphics than this movie? That just bites me in negative places..

3164631,4,B0016Q2D5M,"This was briefly put out with the anaglyth red and green glasses type of 3d. That system was the only type available when this was put out on blu ray. Today you can get a proper 3d version that is actually cheapet to buy than this one is.  I would make sure to ask which version you are getting. The newer 3d version needs a 3d tv and 3d player and it looks outstanding. The older version which uses the old style glasses is ok but it can't compare. In fact using the red and green glasses causes a ghosting effect, (images seems to have lines around them or a fainter second image) this is ccmmon and normal when using those old style glasses. SO you don't want to pay 35.00 for that version, while the version with the 3d logo on it looks great as you will have the black glasses and a three d tv.  The story isn't as good as the 1959 version which is coming out on blu ray in 2012, but it's fun and a romp with effects from the 00's decade so that's a bonus.  It's got extras too. But I would certainly not waste your money on a older 3d version with green and red glasses unless you don't ever intend buying a 3d tv. That would be a mistake though as the format is outstanding. SO make sure to ask which version you are getting. The older is more exp3ensive because it was in print only a few months and lots of people complained abou tit and it was yanked out of print.  The ghosting though is what you get with those glasses on a tv. that's just the way it was until the new format came out and you can get this in the new format for less!.",1335052800,,1546,4.026058631921824

So all in the spirit of fun I find that this Brendan Fraser version is a keeper for me. I enjoyed the regular DVD version initially...until I upgraded my television set. I just bought and watched the 3D verstion of this movie and even though I found the 3D glasses a bit difficult to wear throughout the movie, doing so was worth it. While I believe there is still much work to be done on the quality of 3D movies in general, I found the depth and the ""pop-out"" to be delightful experiences and I plan to purchase a few more select 3D movies.
As far a this version of the Jules Vern Classic, this was my favorite as Trevor Anderson (Fraser), his nephew make a breakthrough discovery and a breakthrough in their relationship that improves the story for me.  This predictable ""never-before-seen world"" (except by Hollywood and previous versions of this story) holds a few new twists and turns as well as an ending that works for me.",1334707200,3,1052,4.473958333333333

The packaging is very nice and is about the right size for a DVD. I have also found that CD's fit nicely into the box.
The film itself is not actually a documentary about travelling to the center of the earth however. I was expecting a David Attenborough type in depth programme with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. I was also dissapointed that the film is old style 3D not compatable with modern 3D tvs, but after a few attempts of squinting, or closing 1 eye and even blinking rapidly all failed i discovered that if you stand as far away from the television as possible and then run towards it, its like things are flying out from the TV at you.

 However after getting the bluray 3D version I was impressed at just how much my opinion of this movie changed. Being made as a pure 3D movie when it hit theaters this version is outstanding. As a rule many movies are somewhat darker as we were the Polarized Glasses. However this was not the case with this version. It is one of the brightest (if not the brightest) 3D titles that I have. As far as movies go the only other title that I have that is as bright as this is Captain America. Do not get me wrong...I have numerous titles that are in 3D but most are CGI movies...Monsters Versus Aliens...MegaMind..Shrek..Dispicable Me..Avatard has a ton of CGI but just not as bright. That's why I say the only other ""Movie"" that is comparable is Captain America. As far as brightness it all varies on the type of equipment one has, I have a Mitsubishi so yours may be brighter than mine.

 My 5 star rating is based solely on the 3D and while it may not have the most out of screen effects the quality of 3D turned this from borderline 3 star viewing to something I will be able to watch several times. I can not say that you are going to love this or it is a must have all I can tell you is that I was glad I bought the 3D Bluray version.

3164672,2,B0016Q2D5M,"Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).

But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying ""Go for it, go for it!""

Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.

The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.

I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film ""Gods and Monsters.""  What did he do to deserve this mess?  Presumably he was well paid for it.",1329868800,,2703,4.518518518518518
3164673,5,B0016Q2D5M,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 25 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, 44 effects between 25 and 30%, 6 at 40%, 3 at 50% and 3 more around 60%. If I had to pick just 3 of my favorite effects from this film, they would be the biting fish at up to 30%, the carnivorous plant around 35% and a glowing bird that flits around between 25% and 40% for about 20 seconds. There are lots of other nice effects for you to pick your own favorites from.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
The depth is, for the most part consistent from scene to scene and is natural to SLIGHTLY exaggerated looking because the footage is so crisp and clear. In fact, the live action 3D is done so well that in some outdoor scenes, the fact that it is actually an indoor set or green-screened, becomes noticeable. (Did I just complain about 3D being done too well?? Must be a full moon or something. LOL)

This is a great action/fantasy film suitable for most family members (rated PG) and I will enjoy watching this movie many times in the future. It easily makes it into my top 10 (out of 100) blu-ray 3D movies.
I should add that this is NOT a 2 disc combo set. The Amazon title is wrong, their ""Product Details"" are correct.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
On my system, in addition to some slight ghosting that most people shouldn't notice, 5 scenes had easily visible crosstalk. I'm not trying to scare you away from this title. It's not perfect but still well worth adding to your collection.
(crosstalk varies from system to system)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

3164700,5,B0016Q2D5M,"First some back-information on the releases..

Journey to the Center of the Earth has been released in at least 3 different Blu-Ray versions now:
Blu-Ray 2D (with 3D anaglyph (green/magenta glasses) + DVD + Digital Copy
Blu-Ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy
Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray 2D

The original Blu-Ray 2D w/ Anaglyph 3D wasn't so great, mainly because the required green/magenta glasses which made the video look terrible (it also showed much more ghosting and the 3D was nice but hard to watch an entire movie). This release was later replaced with a 2D only release.

The 2012 release is a REAL Blu-Ray 3D release (requires a 3DTV). The release is a single-disc with both Blu-Ray 2D and 3D versions on it (there is no Anaglyph version on here, so you will need a 3DTV to view it in 3D). It's also worth noting that there is no longer a DVD or Digital Copy included (There was, however, 8-dollars movie money for the 2nd movie coming out in early 2012).
The 3D Blu-Ray release includes a lenticular cover.

MOVIE - I found the movie to be fun. Not a great movie by any means, but works nice as a ""turn your brain off and just enjoy it without thinking too much about it"" way. Nothing terribly memorable, but also more watchable than most of these movies (and I think a bit of that comes from the 3D - I originally watched it in 2D, but enjoyed it much more in 3D). At 92 minutes, it also doesn't drag on like some movies.

AUDIO - This is an improvement over the original Blu-Ray releases which only had Dolby Digital 5.1 -- the 3D Blu-Ray now has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 -- audio was very nice, didn't notice any issues with it.

VIDEO - Video was also good - the colors seemed a bit odd at times, but still very watchable. An above average transfer.

3D - Here's where the movie really shines. The Movie was filmed in 3D and combines live action and CGI elements very well. Lots of depth, lots of popout (a lot of gimmick popouts also, which I enjoy). I didn't notice ghosting/crosstalk during it (Panasonic DT30 LED TV with shutter glasses), something that is obvious during some movies. Depth seemed very natural and showed good separation.. sharpness was also very good. It was very obviously 3D the entire time, unlike some movies which seem as though 70% of them could easily be in 2D (and quite a few newer releases are just converted to 3D (this one was shot in 3D)). I'd rate it near the high end of 3D releases currently available.

Extras - Extras are sort of thin (same as the original release) - biggest being the commentary. The 3D release also includes a lenticular slipcover.

Overall - Not a great movie, but a fun movie. If you've seen it before and liked it, you'll like it much more in 'real 3D'. I owned the prior release (2D+Anaglyph+DVD+Digital Copy) and was still very happy with this new release. Recommended!",1326844800,88,2832,4.4728682170542635

I look for any debris and dust as I take very good care of my optical disks but found none.

I Recommend the movie but buy it locally where you can take it back for an exchange if you wind up like me. It's just not worth my time and money to send it back. I'll wind up buying it locally at BB or TRGT.

No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.

Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.

Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)",1314144000,,900,4.54320987654321

3164713,3,B0016Q2D5M,"I've read the Jules Verne classic book and watched the 1959 movie version as well as the lamentable 2008 made for TV version and it occurred to me that the best movie interpretation would be one that doesn't take itself seriously. The Jules Verne book really is quite silly and totally unbelievable and it hardly seems possible to make a movie interpretation that is both true to the book and serious. It was with this in mind that I had hopes for the Brendan Frasier version, not HIGH hopes but hopes. The film starts off well enough with Brendan playing a school teacher whose brother Max was lost 10 years ago while searching for the center of the Earth following Jules Verne's novel (a bit of meta fiction). I won't go into the details but Frasier and Max's 13 year old son end up traveling to Iceland to find Max in the legendary Mt. Sneffels with the help of a beautiful Icelandic guide.

I was totally expecting brainless silliness and man did this film deliver. Rather than have our heroes hike for weeks or months into the Earth it's all one big Alice in Wonderland type drop that deposits them I guess hundreds of miles into the Earth. I won't spoil how they survive such an absurd fall. The movie is all one big roller coaster ride that occasionally descends into a LITERAL roller coaster. It really reminded me of one of those 80's summer blockbusters where you buy a big box of popcorn and power down your brain. There's no tension because the characters are all as indestructible as Wile-e Coyote and the whole world seems designed to keep them safe from harm with walls of rock that can be smashed through for easy escape. It's sort of like an MGM back lot adventure show with about as much depth and dignity. This is not to say that it's not enjoyable but it's basically a cartoon with human actors.

What I didn't expect from this film was the terrible special effects (I did not watch this in 3D). The CGI dinosaurs were better in Jurassic Park back in 1993 and the blue screening is so bad you never feel like the actors are anywhere but a sound stage. Many of the action scenes looked like bad video game graphics and REALLY pulled me out of the film. The films 60 million dollar budget is modest by today's standards but it isn't THAT modest. Tron: Legacy had a 170 million dollar budget and you see every penny of it and the CGI world is totally believable. Here it's just laughable. This is DEFINETELY my biggest issue with the film.

The pacing of the story here is a complete departure from the book which was an underground journey of many months. I would estimate that in this film the group was underground for MAYBE a couple of days. You never see them eat or sleep or for that matter show any exhaustion. Despite the fact that Max had gone lost a decade earlier it's only NOW that the heat starts to spike in a lame attempt to increase tension. The temperature rises well above 110 degrees F but you never see anyone show fatigue or sweat. After some adventures with prehistoric piranha's, man eating plants and a T-Rex the group shoots out of the Earth just as swiftly as they descended, out the top of a volcano (sadly that bit of silliness actually is true to the book).

This film is really dumb. Max's son gets a phone call on his cell phone from deep within the Earth despite cell phone's propensity to lose connection even in an elevator or stairwell. Brendan Frasier punches out a plant and they discover what appears to be a hyper intelligent bird who helps guide the group to safety. I wouldn't say that I completely wasted 93 minutes of my life but I probably wouldn't bother watching this film again if for nothing else than the special effects are so bad. The film is far better than the 2008 TV version that leached off this one but the best is still probably the 1959 version.",1306972800,3,3821,4.454285714285715

Not only was it not interesting in the least, but it was very boring. This paint-by-numbers action/adventure movie is so inorganic and artificial that you'll be craving a sense of individuality when it comes to this movie. Unfortunately nothing sets it apart from the rest, and it ends up being a bad B-movie through and through. The fact that the point of this movie is to read the book it's based on is consistently hammered into viewers' heads to the point where it actually seems like a better option. Being someone who has read the book, I can tell you that it is 100 times better than this movie.

For those thinking about seeing this or those who are fans of Brendon Frasier, imagine a crappier, uninteresting version of The Mummy, and that's what you get here. The characters aren't fleshed out at all, their motives are very poor and not explained well, and overall this movie has no substance to it at all.

Accompanying him on this quest is his brother's son and the daughter of a deceased vulcanologist who also was a determined Vernian).

I have to say, this is one of Brendan Fraser's better films.  He's still got a couple of cheesy moments in the film, however most of his acting was right on.  The character development of characters played by Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem was remarkable.  He went from being a snobby brat to a more humane and likeable person without much character degradation.  She went from a serious, practical mountain guide without much faith in her father's beliefs to an realization that both her father's and other Vernian's views have merit and truth which she sees for herself.

The problem was convincing my husband and son that it would be worth watching. Finally, I found Amazon had it marked down to a reasonable price on Blu-Ray and I ran my pleas with my family one more time to snatch it while we can. My husband agreed this time, because he's so wonderfully sweet. His response was, ""Sure, get it if you want."" I bolted from the room and ordered.

Brendan has become one of my favorite actors ever since I saw him in The Mummy. I had no clue he was a naturally talented actor who does comedy mingled with action/adventure so well. Journey made me think a lot of his role in The Mummy and that's what really hooked me. In Journey Brendan (Trevor Andersen) is a scientist. One weekend, his late brother's wife brings his nephew for a visit and drops off some stuff for him that once belonged to his brother. Inside the possessions, he finds Jules Verne's book, Journey to the Center of the Earth, with clues written in the margin by his brother (also a scientist) which sends Trevor and his nephew off for an adventure of a life time.

If you're a Fraser fan, then I'm certain you'll enjoy this and too boot it's fairly family oriented.

This is a good family film. We were able to watch it very comfortably with our 9 year old grand-daughter.

The movie, which is about three people trapped far beneath the earth with prehistoric plants and creatures, is both exciting and funny. The main characters are all likable, and Brendan Fraser is at his charming and funny best.

Sadly, even if you do all the work to correctly track down the 3D dvd version of this film and the 3D glasses. it won't do you much good. The home 3D presentation doesn't exactly jump off the screen at you, so my advice would be to skip the extra trouble and expense that I went through to that end.

Suspension of disbelief is no greater for this 'follow-up' film than it was for the Verne book or for the original movie with James Mason and Pat Boone. The special effects are good, and the same solid dinosaurs about to eat people type that you've come to appreciate ever since Jurassic Park. The story is NOT meant to be a cover of the Verne book, it is sort of a sequel, in a way. That element of the movie was handled in a very interesting fashion.

3164768,5,B0016Q2D5M,"I bought a huge stack of DVD's at a reduced price and nearly bypassed this movie, thinking it was just another boring remake of a classic... like most of the other remakes. I was most definitely wrong and surprised at how wonderful this movie was.

This has spoilers...(for those of you who are thin skinned about reading reviews and then complain because you read reviews which included the storyline.)

I loaded up a 5 disc DVD player and put this one in last because I didn't expect much out of it... and to my surprise, it turned out to be the best movie in the stack. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a while. I bought the normal DVD version of Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser. Nothing fancy. This was not a 3D version.

There really was not a boring moment in the entire movie. It was fun, interesting, well written, well acted, well directed and had wonderful visuals and special effects. It was all unique and refreshing. I was glad they did not sour the movie with a bunch of unnecessary and unbelievable subterranean tribes or inhabitants like we see in other movies like this.

Definitely a great family movie. No violence... other than that of the creatures they encounter... but that was also a nice feature. No blood, gore or killing of any characters in the entire movie. I really get tired of that in other movies. It is amazing how enjoyable a movie can be without those things.

The story was fast paced, kept our interest and exciting to watch. The movie didn't dawdle too long in any one scene. The scenes were fresh, exciting and innovative and not repetitive of any previous movie versions. Anyone who has read my previous reviews knows I do not give out a review like this which is all positive. I usually have complaints even on my most favorite movies... but no negatives on this one on any aspect of it.

For those of you who care about these things... the dialogue and gadgets were technically up to date with the times. So you won't have the teens complaining about it being old fashioned. But at the same time, it met all of the needs of the older audiences as well. It was a quality movie.

The photography & sets were beautiful and unique. The action and story were fresh. The relationships between the three characters were well written and the actors were all wonderful in their roles. The nephew's role was scripted just right... and you don't often see that. Most movies have the kid too bratty. But they did a great job with this character of Sean as did the actor (Josh) who played him. His relationship with his uncle and his interactions were well written and acted and quite believable.

The luminescent birds were a nice touch. I got a kick out of the ending with the bird. That was great. It is something I would have done in his place... so that was well received by the audience. The CGI barracudas and sea creatures were superb and very realistic. I liked the interaction they had with those nasty looking fish with the really hideous teeth. I remember seeing some fossils with similar teeth... so they were more realistic than most people might think since there isn't anything quite like that today.

The magnetic rocks were a fun scene and quite unique. Bravo on the effects of the rock rotating. That was very realistic and would have been overlooked by most directors and special effects experts.

But the best CGI scene was the one with the giant Venus flytraps. That was very realistic... and having him wrestle with them was well done.

I will say that the mining cart scene was a little over the top. It was more like a Disneyland roller coaster ride. Thrilling effects which made it appear to be the ultimate roller coaster ride... but just a little beyond credibility when it jumped the chasm and all three separated cars landed perfectly on the tracks... Then a few minutes later did an impossible 3 direction split of 3 cars onto 3 tracks simultaneously which could not occur without rail switching, and even then, only one at a time per switch. However, other than taking a bit too much creative license... it was a thrilling scene with a lot of excitement. Same comments on the falling scene. A bit much on the extended falling like dropping out of the sky without a parachute and remaining in the fall for a ridiculous time period (similar to spy kids 3)... but they handled the end of the fall fairly well at the end.

We especially thank the writer & director... for once, it was refreshing to see a character bring back the fringe benefits with them at the end of the movie. We really get tired of these movies where they find things like that and then lose them in the end. Finally! Someone got smart and actually brought back the goods and benefited from them. Thank you for not leaving the audience frustrated with the characters stupidity like we see in all the other movies.

Very nice ending! The movie was a delight to watch from beginning to end.

You'd have to be a real curmudgeon not to like it. I recommend it for everyone... all ages... except curmudgeons who are never satisfied with anything. Leave them at home or wait until they are gone so they don't ruin the enjoyment of the movie for you.",1268784000,,5211,4.5356762513312034

3164770,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I rented this on blu ray to test my new HDTV, and got a surprisingly enjoyable film.  First off, the scenery shots are absolutely gorgeous, with waterfalls, mountains and oceans and especially the scene where they first end up underground with these flocks of tiny cute glow-in-the-dark ""hummingbirds"" (one of which befriends the boy) flying around in graceful patterns and the ""sky"" is all shades of copper and rose and gold...beautiful.  I kept pausing the film just to appreciate the breathtaking scenery.

The storyline, while simplistic, has relatively few moments where you think ""it doesn't work that way in real life"", since most scenes are given fairly plausible explanations (they're falling a mile or more into the earth and don't die or get seriously injured when they hit bottom because they end up gradually slowing down with the help of a ""waterslide""-type rock formation).  Some of the humor is corny, but Brendan Frasier delivers his lines with such wide-eyed innocence that I kept chuckling in spite of myself.  I also got a kick out the of the end scene in Italy where the teenage boy starts imitating Italian while talking to the guy whose vinyard they accidentally trashed.  This kid spent a lot of the movie complaining, yet demonstrated commendable maturity at the end to deal with this unexpected situation with aplomb.

I also appreciated the geologic information, which I not only found interesting but I hope may entice some young people to join the ranks of the rapidly aging scientists of America these days.

3164791,4,B0016Q2D5M,"2008's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a loose adaption of Jules Verne's classic book set in modern times. Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and ""volcano tube"" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?

One glance at the poster or dvd and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of ""Indiana Jones"", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of ""Journey"" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling rollercoaster-like railcar sequence a la ""Temple of Doom,"" although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of ""Jurassic Park,"" but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).

I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).

Normally I'm not into mindless ""blockbusters"" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's ""The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.

This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels (""Temple of Doom,"" ""Last Crusade"" and ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three ""Pirates of the Carribean"" flicks).

I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.

One last thing: The dvd features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.

3164805,2,B0016Q2D5M,"received this movie from Netflix last night and was in the mood for a good adventure flick, so I decided to give this movie a try. From the opening scene I started to have this bad feeling in my gut as Trevor Anderson(Brendan Fraser) is having a nightmare about his brother Max running from a very silly looking CG Dinosaur and falling to his death. Still I figured it's just a dream sequence I'm sure the movie won't be as bad as the first minute, so I decided to continue with hope. In the first few scenes we see Trevor is not fairing to well at his job as a volcanologist at a school, infact his office is about to be shut down by some wormy looking guy you just want to hit. When Trevor goes home that evening and listens to his answering machine he is reminded that is thirteen year old nephew Sean(Josh Hutcherson) is coming to stay with him for the next ten days. When Sean's mother drops him off she gives Trevor a box with some of Maxes old stuff including a book Journey To The Center of The Earth. When Trevor opens the book later on he finds notes written by his late brother indicating he might have actually found the center of the earth. After going to his lab to look into it Trevor decided to head to Icland to investigate and brings Sean. So they get to Icland and pick up a guide Hannah(Anita Briem) and after a series of events get stuck underground where they end up in a world inside our own world, the center of the Earth.

  So here's my take on this movie. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between. The effects weren't that good in my opinion, maybe if this was a made for TV movie but not up to par for blockbuster movie theater standards in my opinion. Most of the scenes look like they were real people with a moving picture behind them, and any of the creatures in this movie look so fake, almost cartoonlike with there expressions, infact this movie was like watching some kind of looney toons cartoon with live people. They can fall for miles and somehow survive without a scratch. The movie was released in 3-D in the theaters and maybe it looked good in that setting, but on DVD it just looks silly. I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 I say if you have kids under ten it might be worth watching with them, otherwise I'd stay away from this one, there is a 1959 movie of the same name maybe oneday I'll check that one out.",1257033600,,2376,4.206140350877193

3164807,3,B0016Q2D5M,"This (latest, mindless) remake of the Jules Verne classic is hopelessly silly, Brendan Fraser must possess an innate ""annoyance"" chromosome, and if I saw one more death-defying plunge down some endless abyss I was promising to scream louder than the actors.  Yet, oddly, indescribably, uncharacteristically, I found myself having a bit of fun watching this moronic bubble-gum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  I'm just not going to tell anyone.

Playing a pseudo scientist (which is fitting, as Fraser is a pseudo actor) journeying to Iceland with the young son (Josh Hutcherson) of his dearly-departed brother, Fraser's Professor Trevor Anderson comes under the tutelage of Hannah Asgeirsson (Anita Briem), the daughter of Trevor's brother's former mentor (huh?).  Hannah takes the two Americans on an Icelandic expedition, where they end up plunging down a hole and into a funky world of animated nonsense.  All the silliness is amplified by cornpone action sequences, yet I had to keep reminding myself this film was initially a 3D offering for kids (and Hutcherson darn sure plays to that audience), so it's all in good clean (sort of) fun.  The ending is predictably (and conveniently) over the top, and the plot instantly forgettable, but JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is still worth one or two giggles and gaggles.

No plot spoilers from me, but even with a healthy suspension of disbelief, this movie has so many holes and overly cute elements that it falls firmly into the same category as Looney Toon Cartoons for me. Except for one tear jerker scene (relatively short and needed to close a plot line), it is mostly comic mayhem and some bits of genuine excitement. It flows like a video game, moving from scene to scene at a hectic pace that most kids will enjoy.

About the 3D: The DVD we received had the 2D version on one side and the 3D version on the other. It also came with four 3D glasses. The 3D shown in the theaters uses a completely different technology to produce the 3D effect than the type that is possible on home TVs. This resulted in a hugely disappointing experience for my family, as the 3D effect bothered all of our eyes.

First it's important to note that not all versions include the 3D version on the reverse side of the disc. If you're looking for 3D, make sure the version you are buying includes both the 2D and 3D versions. They will both be on a single disc.

Just recently acquiring a Mitsubishi 65"" 3D-ready DLP HDTV I was quite anxious to start viewing all the home variety 3d programming I could get my hands on.

First I found a couple of movies that I knew my kids would love and made the purchase. First was Spy Kids in 3d, followed by Lava Girl and Shark boy. While there were a few spots (very few) with mediocre 3d effects, all in all I was pretty disappointed with the lack of depth perception, clarity, color, and items that were supposed to 'pop' out at you. On a scale from 1 to 10 for 3d goodness, I'd give each a 3.

Not wanting to give up on home 3d viewing, I searched for another kid friendly 3d movie for home viewing, and wound up ordering Journey to the Center of the Earth.

Now, I haven't watched this with my kids yet, that will be this weekend. But I just completed my pre-viewing - in 3d - and all I can say is WOW!
Unlike the other two movies mentioned above, both of which had you putting on your 3d glasses, then taking them off, then putting them on again, the entire movie here is in 3d. And the 3d effects are good. I mean really good.

Finally I was able to see stuff pop out of the screen at me. And the entire move - all scenes - look as though you are viewing them through a viewmaster. Total depth of scene, along with decent color and clarity. I am so happy to finally have something that will make my 3d hdtv come to life. And that I know my kids are going to love as well!
My advice. If you're looking for a good 3d movie to watch at home, don't miss this one.

The only drawback I've found is that this movie uses their own unique 3d galsses, instead of the common red/green variety. Too bad since I own several pair of expensive plastic framed standard anaglyph red/green glasses. So, when watching this movie, we are forced to use the cheap paper glasses that come with it, as no others will work (I've tried).

Brendan Fraser is reliably affable, and the tour guide is really cute, but the movie special effects are TV-show quality, at least in 2-D. Watchable, but nothing special.",1241136000,,257,4.863636363636363
3164860,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Fraser, Anita Briem and Josh Hutcherson go deep in the relatively entertaining tale ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth.""  This version of ""Journey"" is not a remake nor is it an adaptation of the Jules Verne adventure that some many other films have been based on.

In this particular tale, Fraser plays a seismic geologist named Trevor Anderson who is losing students and his brother's memorial research center at the university where he teaches and does research.  When his nephew, Sean (Hutcherson), comes up to spend a few days with him before moving with his mother to Canada, the pair uncover notes in Sean's father's copy of ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth"" that match up with some of Trevor's research.  This leads them to believe that Sean's dad might have been on to something before he went missing in the field.

With Sean's father's copy of ""Journey"" in tow, a hasty trip to Iceland is planned to check data gathered at one of Trevor's sites.  Notes in the novel lead the pair to an obscure professor's research institute in Iceland where they meet the now-deceased scientist's daughter, Hannah (Briem).  She agrees to guide them on their quest and then the three of them literally journey to the center of the Earth.

Once the group enters the cave that will eventually lead to the center of the Earth, the viewer is offered a ton of visual oohh's and ahhh's.

Originally shot in 3-D, the film relies on the gimmick a bit too much at times and the plot suffers for it.  The CGI is very vibrant and colorful, and can be sketchy at certain points.  However, the entire film has a light air to it, and the sometimes goofy CGI only aids to this.  From runaway mining cars a la ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" to a race for life against an enormous T-Rex that nods to ""Jurassic Park,"" the writers/director/producers know exactly what they've got with this film and try to build upon it throughout the movie.

Fraser, Hutcherson and Briem work very well together.  While there's quite a bit of generic dialogue between the characters, they seem to be in on the joke that this film is meant strictly to entertain and do nothing else.  All three of them seemed to be having fun with the silliness of the script.

While it isn't the greatest family film out there, it is definitely a crowd pleaser for families with children under the age of thirteen.  Some of the action might be a little tough for younger viewers to watch, but the film has no foul language (although adults and most kids will pick up the ""shist"" line easily), no sexuality and only brief moments of peril.

Take it for what it is.  It's funny, silly and plays to Fraser's comedic strengths.  He's one of the few actors who can pull off the action/comedy bit and do it well.  It's more deserving of three-and-a-half stars than four, but I rounded up for the simple fact that it is a very fun film to watch.

Recommended to families with children interested in science fiction and fantasy, fans of Fraser's work, and to folks who just want to turn of their brains for a bit and have a good laugh.",1241136000,,3090,4.53971119133574

The 1959 version with it's comically outdated ""special"" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the ""gravitas"" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie?

People who have complained about the color being washed out probably didn't pay attention to the box that popped up before starting the 3-D movie that said to turn your TV settings from ""Cinema"" to ""Standard"" because the movie settings are set to Standard, and Cinema will only wash out the color.  As for the ""too much green"" or ""too much red"" comments, well, that just comes with the technology.

This rendition might just be my favorite.  Brendan Frasier does his signature comedic role in this movie where he and a couple of people wind up making their way to the Center of the Earth in the very traditional Jules Verne story.

Don't expect an adult story, expect Verne's story.  Expect a pinch of comedy.  Expect Dinosaurs.  Expect neat special effects.  Expect to hang your brain at the door.

This is a light airy movie that delivers marvelously provided you don't go into it expecting some kind of heavy drama, or high adventure.  If you're here for a lighter version of Journey to the Center of the Earth - this is it.

Of note, there are really only 3 characters to this movie with minor characters coming in at the very beginning and then the very end.  So you'll wind up seeing a lot of Brendan Frasier and his couple of young cohorts.

The 3-D version makes this great flick better!  Everything across the screen literally jumps out at you.  You will want to retrieve you favorite 3-D specs and watch it in a dark room.

Fraser, Hutcherson, and Briem give stellar performances with the Weiss, Flackett, and Levin screenplay that follows Jules Vern's original novel.  As the characters progress deep down into the earth we learn applied science while being entertained by science fiction.  We see diamonds galore in volcano tubes, luminescent birds, hungry sea monsters, floating rocks, and even a crazed T-Rex.  3-D adds to this excitement.  (One hopes that these moviemakers will indeed make a sequel- hinted about Atlantis- in the final scene).

That was what passed for a nifty special effect in 1959.  Today it's 3-D effects.

Of course, audiences of today are far too sophisticated to fall for lizards with horns and fins glued to them; in the age of movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B00003CXAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>, only a digitally animated Gigantosaurus will do.

Trevor's brother and Sean's father Max disappeared a decade before looking for the center of the Earth.  Max left behind sensors that detect geological shifts in the Earth's crust and a cryptic series of notes in a Jules Verne novel (guess which one?). When one of the sensors fails in Iceland, Trevor decides to go on an adventure in 1950s fashion, bringing along his plucky nephew for the ride.

Accompanying Trevor and Sean is the fetching Hannah sgeirsson (Antia Briem), the daughter of another volcanologist and the only person with any spelunking skill whatsoever.  While checking on the device, lightning strikes, our heroes dive for cover, and from there it's a lot of falling, screaming, and running.

This is a 3-D movie, which means that at various times and for no reason whatsoever, something flies straight at the screen.  Since you will likely not have invested in the expensive 3-D glasses and you may not have even had the good sense to rent the 3-D version, this makes the movie seem even dumber than it is.

The other surprise is that despite the dinosaurs and the hottie, this movie is aimed at a younger set.  The dialogue isn't very good, although Fraser does his best.  Sean is meant to be a wisecracking preteen modern hero, but he reverts quickly to type.  Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.

Did I mention the irritating glow-in-the-dark mascot?  There's a bird.  It follows Sean around.  Only he can understand it.  And it glows in the dark.

Wrong.
The relation to the original story is weak, with only the `idea' preserved, none of the richness of character, imagination and depth of detail of the book (or the original James Mason film, for that matter..).
The script is geared to kids, and is all about moving quickly through the motions in the same way those short movies that introduce amusement park attractions do.  No-one cares about character development or building tension etc... it's just - when can we get to our next `moment'!  And if it's moments you are after, there are certainly some ok effects on display, and younger viewers might have their interest held.. but I for one was grateful it only lasted 90 minutes.
So much for the film - what about the 3D!  Well, there is the option to watch in 3D on one disc, or 2D on the other.  In 2D the movie is flat, lighting looks abnormally bright, and colours washed out.  On the 3D version - yes, you really do get to watch in 3D - or at least as many of you have glasses...  However, the effect though stunning is rather erratic, the glasses uncomfortable cheap cardboard, the images in dark and weird colours thanks to the green / red glasses you wear.  I think watching in 3D is an exciting novelty - but based on this, it's a cinema experience, not a home theatre one, no matter if you do have a large projector screen. And clearly directors have not yet figured out how to make a movie that happens to be 3D, rather than an amusement park ride drawn out to feature length in order to get a release.  It's all just too self conscious.
Shame, I love Jules Verne, and even beneath the shallowness of this effort I enjoyed some of it in the way younger kids will.  But my advice - save the pennies, and next time a movie like this comes along, try and see it at the cinema if you want to see it in 3D.",1232668800,,1906,4.373937677053824

We didn't and we viewed the movie in 2-D, with 3-D glasses on and vowed only to see 3-D in theatres as iat wasn't very good. That night I went to Amazon.com and brought up this movie and learned it has both 2-D and 3-D versions on it. Yes, we put the 3-D glasses back on and viewed the movie on the other side. Wow, what a concept! It really does work if you view the correct side, 3-D, with the 3-D glasses. :) It was a good movie and the 3-D was very good.

3164939,1,B0016Q2D5M,"First off, the 3D effects did nothing for me except give me a headache. I took off the glasses after 2 minutes because I couldn't tolerate it. And apparently it wasn't just me because my friend felt the same way. As for the movie. Boring!!! Predictable. It lacked energy and there was no where near enough action for an ""adventure"" movie. There would be a short sequence of potential excitement, and then... nothing. The acting: Ho Hum!! Usually I can at least finish a movie, especially if I paid for it. But not this. My suggestion: invest in something else.",1231200000,,560,4.61

I keep having to say NO to all of the Superhero movies because of the PG-13 rating. So it was great to be able to say ""Yes"" to my 7-year-old twin boys for once. This is a ""manly"" movie. The emotional issues men and boys face in life are handled succinctly, giving this movie more depth than the non-stop action would seem to allow. The 3D effects truly add to the excitement. The few gratuitous/gross ones were just plain old fun & funny. The theater was packed and people actually clapped at the end. I hope Hollywood pays attention and puts out more PG movies of this caliber.",1231113600,,707,4.574803149606299
3164941,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Granted this is an adventure/action film.  And granted that it was kept fairly clean for family viewing.  Still, I had some problems with the movie.  Without going into detail, it sort of mimics the original Jules Verne story.  However, it is interesting in that it references the original story as some sort of secret code of a quasi-secret society and implies that it wasn't at all fictional when Verne wrote it.

Here's where it goes wrong.  The characters are shallow.  The plot is really unoriginal.  The special effects are so obviously specially generated effects that they aren't particularly special at all.  Even the sentimentalism is very thin.

There were many improbable scenes that require such a stretch of suspension of disbelief to make it work, that it didn't.  Another movie I think of, in a similar genre, had no issue with suspension of disbelief.  No, in fact, Raiders of the Lost Ark made you believe it was all quite possible.  Easily so.  Journey to the Center of the Earth did not.

As a side note: we switched from the 3D to the 2D after about 15 minutes into it.  It just wasn't that visually appealing as a 3D movie.

This was worth seeing once, and only if you rent the DVD, in my opinion.",1230854400,,1219,4.621495327102804

However, it was a little cheesy with the special effects. With today's technology I expect a little more out of sci-fi movies.  Not enough action packed adventure for me. My husband didn't say much.",1230508800,,363,4.671875
3164943,5,B0016Q2D5M,"I watched this movie twice (once in the theater and once on DVD) and I enjoyed it each time. Although I think some of the ""close calls"" were quite unrealistic and would probably never happen in real life if someone actually fell to the center of the earth. Anyway here are a few of the close calls that I remember from the movie. I took notes on all of the close calls because they were so cool and had me at the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie.

1) Trevor almost steps into a 200 ft deep cliff but Hannah the mountain guide pushes him out of the way at the last minute.

2) When all 3 of them were climbing down the rope wasn't long enough so Hannah cuts the rope and lets Trevor go or else the 3 of them will plunge down. He was actually already at the bottom and Hannah played a trick on him!

3) MY FAVORITE: Going over the broken tracks in the mine and where Hannah has to jump onto Trevor's car.

4) MOST UNREALISTIC- An actual smooth landing into the center of the earth after a 10 minute plunge when the muscovite breaks through (they end up swimming for a long time which is quite unrealistic since they don't have oxygen tanks).

5) Where both Trevor and Sean are chased by a big dinosaur, and the dinosaur falls through the muscovite. Trevor almost plunges down, but he catches the top of the cliffhanger. He is VERY LUCKY like he said in the movie.

6) Exiting the center of the enter (VERY COOL)!

These are the 6 out of the total of 11 close calls that really stuck out to me in the movie.",1230422400,,1518,4.108108108108108
3164944,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I saw this film in 3D in San Francisco.  It was outstanding.  There was excellent technical direction, as well as an interesting story.  The film has the usual stereoscopic gags with things popping into your eyes which I object to.  With 3D coming into increased use, perhaps Directors will get a clue it plays to the VFX, not the story.  As a slight digression, the best stereoscopic movie out there is ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" - this is a conversion of a formerly 2D movie; the 3D conversion enhanced the film.

Anaglyph video, as well as anaglyph comics, have been around at least since the 1950's.  Whoever did this conversion to a nonstandard choice of green/magenta versus the usual red/cyan does not make sense to me, considering the body of technical knowledge, skill available for such a conversion using red/cyan.  Perhaps it is an attempt to deploy rights management, but the glasses are available separately.  I observed many alignment problems with JTTCOTE.  Some shots with vertical misalignment in the original were not fixed in post.  There is a particular scene in the guide's house sitting around a coffee table: it was as if the two cameras had slightly different magnification.

The 2D conversion of the movie was well done, but not excellent.  I have viewed several BD videos by now, and I expect a certain amount of care in the conversion.

It is my opinion that the technical deployment of the stereoscopic portion of this BLU-RAY release of JTTCOTE was a hack job, poorly thought out, poorly done.  Considering how well the stereoscopic version in the theatrical release was so well done (albeit some minor alignment problems), that it should be so poorly deployed on the DVD release.  I saw the discussion of this film at NAB in Las Vegas 2008.  The Director and his colleagues put such effort and care in the technical deployment of this film, only to have it so poorly rendered in this DVD release has done the work a considerable disservice.  If you are purchasing this release with the goal of viewing this in stereoscopic 3D in your home, it is my strong opinion that you will be very disappointed.",1230336000,2,2136,4.8054794520547945

I don't know if we will watch this in 3d all of the time, but we don't need to. The 3d copy has a 2d version on the other side of the disc.

My kids are indiana jones fanatics and loved this movie too. Yes it is sophmoric and shallow but it is a good ride at the same time.

3164957,4,B0016Q2D5M,"This remake of Journey to the Center of the Earth is a pretty good version.  No stellar performances, special effects are good.  The blu-ray is crisp and clean.  The adaptation of 3-D for blu-ray has a few issues though.  It uses an unusual combination of red and green lenses, and the green will often get too dark and you'll find yourself adjusting the glasses to try and get a better view.  I'm not sure if the glasses are what cause the movie to become so devoid of color, but it almost appears to be a black and white film in 3-D.  Though entertaining, some of the 3-D tricks are the oldest in the book, and you almost feel like you've been there - done that.  You WILL appreciate the ability to choose between the 3-D and the standard versions of the film.

Obviously the comparison between this version of Journey to the Center of the Earth and it's original counterpart is going to be like comparing apples and oranges. The technology has progressed so much for this latest version.  You won't need to use your imagination so much now.

3164960,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I wanted to see this flick because I liked the original Journey to the Center of the Earth with Jame Mason and Pat Boone.  That movie was a real long journey, mostly on foot and still captured the imagination.

What this movie did was made the story into more of fascinating joy ride.  It gave you thrill ride sensation, like you were at an amuzement park or at a theme park.  The movie had some fun scenes that must have been great in 3D.  I liked the roller coaster ride that was created from the mine shaft train, a little Indiana Jonesish, but still fun.  The dino scene was a little silly, but still fun.  The falling scenes were also pretty good.  Although the humor was campy, there were definately a few laughs.

Fraser is a rather nice guy geologist who is down on his luck, his brother went missing over ten years ago and Fraser is attempting to keep his work going.  His nephew is sent to spend a short vacation with him and Fraser is given his brothers things that eventually open the door to going on the journey.  Cool were the older copies of Jules Vernes actual book.  I remembered some of those from grammar school.

There is the usual troubled teen issue at the beginning and he grows from his bonding experience with his uncle.  So we have a good story, good comedy, great action and effects, but, it was still a bit light.  I wish they would have had Pat Boone show up in the flick for a cameo giving us a connection with the old movie.

I enjoyed the scenes in Iceland and Italy, and of course, the Center of the Earth.  Good for a laugh or for a light evening of got nothing better to do.",1229990400,,1610,4.260726072607261

Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.

The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.

I found myself fast-forwarding scenes where characters were constantly yelling and screaming as they were being chased and hounded, an the really sappy scene in the middle.

It's a fun film for all ages Fraser fans or not.

This product comes with both 3D and normal picture which was a bonus,
I saw the movie 3D at the cinema  and was so looking forward in getting it home, the only thing that I must say I HATED the glsses that came with the movie, I wish it came with the glases that we wore at the cinema.

Brenden Frasier lacks some of his charm in this movie; the lines seemed to be flatly delivered.  His co stars are okay, not exactly memorable but not how-did-they-get-the-part bad.  What I did find enjoyable was the basic story of getting lost in the depths of the earth, finding all kinds of weird things there and the struggle to escape. I particularly liked the crazy flying fish scene and imagine that it would have been cool to watch in 3-D. The dialogue is lacking but the thrills make up for it.",1228176000,,631,4.422413793103448

3165037,3,B0016Q2D5M,"This movie can be best described as roller coaster action - meaning, the movie goes from one action sequence to the next, with a very shallow story in between that serves mostly as a way for the movie to move from action piece to action piece.

With that said, I liked the movie.  It was mindless fun that kept me entertained.  I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser (sp?), but he does a decent enough job here - he is at his usual slap-stick comedy routine, but that helps lighten the mood of the movie.  Even the kid actor did a good job (I remember him from Bridge to Terebitia (sp?), so I was hoping he would do just as well in this movie).

As to the BD itself - the movie has a pretty clean transfer, which helps make the 3D version of the movie look even better.  I must admit, even though I felt a bit silly sitting there with those 3d glasses, the 3d wasn't bad at all; too bad it causes the colors to be crap, but otherwise, it was well done.",1228089600,,955,4.080213903743315

The movie is an excuse for a 3D film (they used the RealD polarized system (passive glasses) in theaters which was dark but good), and would be all right IF the 3D was even remotely as watchable here, (It's not). To combat pirating they used a magenta-green system instead of the red-blue standard, and it's even worse than bad. Now that there are Mitsubishi and Samsung HDTVs that are 3D ready out there the studios need to get with the program and produce either field sequential or polarized versions,(watchable on affordable 22"" iz3D monitors). Anaglyph just doesn't cut the mustard anymore. People who will pay for blu-ray will shell out for the hardware to get a decent 3D experience at home! If I were either of those 2 companies above I'd contract the studios to put out software for the Tri-def or Stereoscopic viewer format which they are compatible with.

The blu-ray format for Journey uses a red/green anaglyph rather than the more common red/blue.  This may be a matter of taste.  The concept of 3D is used best used to draw the viewer into the action.  This was done well in the movie ""Spy Kids 3D"".  There is always the use of ""coming at you"" in the 3D which should be used with discretion.  Journey over-uses this concept in a very predictable manner.

3165075,4,B0016Q2D5M,"3D on TV isn't going to be anything like high tech IMAX, but it isn't all that bad with proper colored lenses. I have a sample pack of ""Lee Filter"" colored ""gel"" lenses 1.5""x3.5"" that I got at a company that sells colored gel lenses for theater and band spot lights. What I did was start the movie and pause it at a place that showed 3D artifacts. The halo colors I saw were green and pink. They might be different on your TV depending on how your color is adjusted and that is the main point here. I don't think one pair of colored glasses is going to work well on all TVs. In this case, I started with light colored pinks and greens and kept trying darker samples of each color until I could no longer the see pink halo through the green lens or green halo through the pink lens. At this point all one should be able to see is a single object in the picture without any halo. I held the sample pack up to my eyes with the pink sample out to the left and the green sample out to the right. By changing the angle of the lenses between vertical to 45 degrees (darkens and lightens the image slightly) and rotating the lenses so one lense is closer to one eye than the other, I could fine tune the image. After I found the sweet spot, I sat back and really enjoyed the movie. Some of the 3D images actually left the TV but mostly it was like looking through a window at another 3D world. Until 3D format become uniform industry wide, I think this will work the best whether for red and blue or red and green and all shades in between. A person could remove the lenses from the sample pack and make their own glasses, but the next movie might not work with those exact colors.

BTW, the colors that worked for me were ""Primary Green and Bright Pink"", but again, it may be all in how the color scheme was set up on my TV.
Also, I have a 62"" Toshiba Rear Projection DLP TV and I sat real close.

3165080,3,B0016Q2D5M,"It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be ""too many."" I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/horrible-television-adaptation-in-January/dp/B0016MJ6HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">horrible television adaptation in January</a>&nbsp;starring Rick Schroeder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B0017I3RKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000EWBKLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mummy-series/dp/B001HQZJPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mummy series'</a>&nbsp;of films.

The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.

Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.

Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1959-version-starring-James-Mason/dp/B00007JMD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1959 version starring James Mason</a>&nbsp;as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the `59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...

It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines (""What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs."" -- when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-novel/dp/1562549146/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the novel</a>.

It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zathura/dp/B000DBHX4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zathura</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/B000P6R5Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RV/dp/B000GCFNZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RV</a>, and the soon-to-be-released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cirque-Du-Freak/dp/0316153788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cirque Du Freak</a>.

It is escapist fare that is good family fun without being bland.  I'm sure I will watch it over and over but apparently not on my iPhone till I'm over being angry at Warner Brothers for their false advertising.

3165102,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I am a fan of science fiction, especially the classical kind of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and other European authors of the pre-Hollywood era.  I've read many of these books, and have watched almost all the English-language movie adaptations of said books, and I will say that this is the best adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth produced by Hollywood so far.  This version is not as faithful to the book's plot as previous versions.  But as a movie, it is by far the best, for the following reasons.  First of, the special effects are great and very realistic, which is a required of any sci-fi movie these days.  Second, the action and dialogue were actually quite believable.  Brendan Fraser actually played a half-serious role, and the movie, though funny, was not ridiculous.  The other two characters; the boy and the lady, came across well, and were cast well.  Last, there were no outlandish scenes involving far-fetched technology, or some long-lost underground tribe of humans.  This made the movie very believable.  All in all, quite good, and probably Fraser's best action movie in the past several years.",1226707200,,1128,4.889473684210526

Using colored lenses that use tints that are more 'opposite on the color wheel; the picture seperates better. Not perfect, but better than most and of course the picture neutralizes; but you got a 3-D movie in the house!
The Dolby track needs to be turned up to compensate for the lack of HD track as there are a lot of 3-D sound effects that whooosh, click or boom with the film.

I missed the 3D version in theaters and was surprised by how well the 3D works on this DVD. The glasses have magenta and blue lenses, unlike the typical red/blue lenses of most home 3D movies, the ghosting (double images) is minimal. Certainly the 3D looks far better than on Sony's ""Polar Express."" You need the glasses (four pair) that come will the movie for maximum effect.

The story is pretty basic, but has a lot of action.  If you watch the regluar non 3D version I would give it a 3 out of 5, not great, but not bad either.  HOWEVER, The 3D is what makes this movie extra fun and it was specifically designed to be a 3D movie as is evident by the cinematography.  This movie is a great one to show off your blu-ray player to guests or when your kids have a sleep over.

Yes, the colors are obviously going to be distorted AFTER you put the glasses on, but its still in 3D.  It takes about 5 minutes for your eyes to adjust to looking through the glasses.  Then your eyes will start to color correct some of the distortion.  Also, the start up screen tells you to brighten your flat screen as the glasses make the picture appear darker.  I'll still take this version over the regular version any day, even IF the colors are distorted by the glasses.

You get 4 pairs of glasses with the movie.  If you plan to show this to more than 4 people at a time in the future, do what I did and buy an extra few pairs on Amazon.com while they are still available.  I searched Amazon.com using the words "" journey center 3D glasses "" .

In fact it is in my top five all time favorites so you can imagine from the ads I suspected this remake would be a real loser. Especially when I heard it was 3D. In all seriousness do you ever truly take the 3D movies serious? We did not watch it in 3D but I imagine we will at some point. After watching it with my wife we decided two things. We still like the original best, the second was this isn't a true remake. However, I mean that in the best terms. We actually found this version quite entertaining and not at all like the original and that we liked too. It doesn't try to be or beat the classic movie. Although you see some jewels, giant mushrooms, a dinosaur, et cetera, none of it feels or looks the same.

Brendan Frasier (The Mummy), Josh Hutcherson (Jurassic Park III), and Anita Briem do a great job of acting in this movie and that really helps too. Look for a couple cute references in this movie to Josh's part in JP III. Good quality DVD with good replayability. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could but I don't feel bad about four. There aren't enough movies like this to suit me these days. As a kid I was spoiled by having lots of movies like this to watch. I kind of feel sorry for kids and families today because if they don't appreciate the classic versions, it's a wasteland out there for the most part. I recommend it for the whole family. If you enjoyed this catch ""Stardust"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom"".

3165118,2,B0016Q2D5M,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is directed by an Oscar winning visual effects artist, and it shows. The movie looks amazing. And that's about it. The writing is plodding, predictible and as stale as the air in an underground cave.

The actors do their best to bring charm and freshness to the film, but its like performing CPR on a day-old corpse. The characters say and do things that a baboon with two brain cells to rub together wouldn't do, just to further the abysmal screenwriting and set the movie up for director Eric Brevig's strong point; the visual effects.

And Brevig does a good job with the visuals, the underground terrarium is a sci-fi wonderland, although the dinosaurs look a little lame. But if there's one thing that's been proved over and over, its that gorgeous CGI makes a good video game, but not a good movie.

I couldn't help comparing this to Brendan Fraser's 10-year-old action adventure, The Mummy. The CGI in The Mummy was cutting edge for its time, and its still looks fine. But the writing is witty, the characters are engaging, the whole thing is livelier and more memorable because someone put some effort into the storytelling.  Ultimately, that's what adds more depth to a movie about a reanimated 3000-year-old corpse than in The Journey to the Center of the Earth.",1226361600,,1307,4.719298245614035

I love Branden Fraser - loved him in The Mummy! Here is portrays a rather wimpy college professor trying to prove a theory about the fact that Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth novel is not just fiction - but it actually there is such a place.

His nephew is played by Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabihia) - typical 13 year old that hates the fact that he has to spend 2 weeks out of his summer vacation with his uncle.  When an anomaly in his computer lab detects another active volcano that might lead to Earth's core - he takes his nephew to Iceland to meet with another professor that had the same belief in Verne's theories.

When they arrive in Iceland they are greeted by the professor's daughter (Anita Briem) who is a mountain guide but staunchly doesn't believe in her father's writings.  She then agrees to take them up the mountain for an exorbitant fee.

I felt that much of the movie were clips from other films...  i.e. Scenes from Jurassic Park with extinct creatures, complete with the T-Rex; the roller coaster mine scene from Indiana Jones - Temple of Doom.  The acting was rather stilted and the scenes trite at times. The action adventure pace was good though as well as the special effects.

By  Zendoch ""Zendoch"" (USA) - See all my reviews

I just finished watching this film on a 42"" lcd flat screen tv with a blu ray system in place. I bought it after hearing how good it was in 3D and figured that the technology would be the same. Wrong-O!
The first thing I noticed when I took the glasses out that they were the old colored 3D glasses and those never gave true 3D. As I watched the movie I found that some of the effects where hit or miss. Sometimes the 3D would seem to pop out a bit but most of the time the movie was like watching the old view master toys but the picture was moving. Also, like noted by some of the other reviews, the glasses distorted the picture. My wife wears contact lenses (gas premables or something like that.)and she commented that the picture seemed to jump into black or white for her. The manufactuers only suggestion is to watch the movie on a bright setting.
Overall the movie is some what enjoyable but the reviews about how great the 3D is in theaters should not be here. It is misleading. The technology in the movie theaters was polarized I've found out which gives the movie a far superior look. If you've ever experienced Disney at one of their theme parks you know what I mean.
I would avoid buying this movie until they remaster it to work with polarized 3D or some other technology that will give you a theater like experience the movie itself is not good enough to blow the money on unless you are a HUGE Brendan Fraser fan.

I'll add that to pay what one pays for blu-ray disc you should expect more from advanced technology than an upgrade in the color of your glasses. HD and blu-ray create beautiful pictures so unless you want a 3D experience that cheapens your set up I would, rent, skip or borrow a buddy's until they remaster this.",1226102400,2,1855,4.340057636887608

3165124,5,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Frasier stars in this loose adaptation of the classic Jules Verne novel by the same name.  Frasier stars as Trevor Anderson, a college professor who teaches plate tectonics and volcanism.  He is kidded by his colleagues because he only has two students in his class.  Ten years earlier, Trevor's brother went off to prove that the assumptions made by Verne in his novel were actually true.  Trevor has also agreed to take in his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for the summer.  Trevor share his beliefs about the center of the earth with Sean.  Soon, the two are off to Iceland to track down a possible entry to the center of the earth.

Once in Iceland, Sean and Trevor meet Hannah (Anita Briem).  Hannah is the daughter of a dead Icelandic professor whom Trevor's brother was working with.  It is possible that the two may have indeed found the entryway described by Verne.  Hannah agrees to be Trevor's guide and take him to the possible entry site.  Once there, Trevor discovers a piece of scientific apparatus and retrieves it, but a severe lightning storm strikes, forcing Trevor to drop the apparatus and run to the safety of a nearby cave.  Unfortunately, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean are trapped when a large rockslide covers the entrance, but they did indeed find the entrance to the center of the earth, for soon, they are careening down an abandoned mineshaft in coal cars.  Then, they fall through a thin layer of rock and, just as in Verne's novel, find themselves at the center of the earth.

But, once there, Hannah makes a sobering discovery; she find's Trevor's deceased brother.  After burying him, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean must find a way back to the surface before the underground temperature gets too hot.  Along the way, they encounter some nasty sea creatures, a very scary T-Rex, and some hungry carnivorous plants.  Their only hope is to reach a vent which leads to the surface, but this vent is located on the far side of a vast underwater ocean.  Will the three adventurers make it before its too late?

This is an excellent movie.  Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role, and Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are very good as well.  The special effects are first-rate, and there are several exciting moments in the movie, including the T-Rex chase, the journey across the underground ocean, and the thrilling ride in the mine cars.

I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  It does a good job of combining adventure and comedy.  Viewers familiar with Jules Verne's story will surely enjoy this fine movie.",1226102400,,2548,4.778032036613272
3165125,3,B0016Q2D5M,"I'm not sure that Jules Verne, who was a stickler for scientific detail - be it imaginary or real - would think too highly of this film, even though it's not a true adaptation of his original novel.  In this cinematic world, scientific fact is the equivalent of a prize greased pig - everyone keeps chasing it, but no one ever catches it.  If you're going to throw realism to the curb, though, you might as well do it in unabashed grand style - and that is precisely what you get in this 21st century Journey to the Center of the Earth.  What you have here is your basic summer-time action comedy.  These guys survive falls that Wile E. Coyote couldn't walk away from.  Fortunately, the whole thing is entertaining enough to overcome all of the inanities that could otherwise have doomed this film into forgettable silliness.  In other words, it's a Brendan Fraser movie.  Every time I see Brendan Fraser in a movie, my immediate reaction is to say uh oh and expect the worst - yet every time I actually end up feeling entertained.  That's not to say this is a good movie - it's more of what I call a ""good enough"" movie.

Fraser plays Trevor Anderson, a volcanologist dedicated to continuing his late older brother's studies.  Max apparently got himself killed searching for the lost world described in Verne's novel, believing that the father of science fiction was describing fact and not fantasy.  Just when his lab is stolen out from under him and all seems to be lost, a 10-day visit with Max's son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) brings with it new clues in the form of notes inside Max's copy of Verne's novel - and this leads uncle and nephew to discover a new site in Iceland they simply have to explore.  The scientist they want to check with in Iceland turns out to be dead, but his hot redheaded daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) agrees to guide the two up the mountain to the site.  Of course, they end up trapped by a cave-in and forced to explore the mountain cave system in search of an exit.  They find a lot more than that, though.

The film's myriad of CGI effects aren't all that impressive in 2D, but I'm sure the 3-D version must pack much more of a punch.  Either way, though, I was surprised at how few ""prehistoric"" creatures there were on display.  For example, I expected to see people running from dinosaurs all over the place, but there's basically just one giant monster to be found here.  The characters' falls are worth watching, though, especially the first big one.  If there's a longer falling scene in any other movie, I haven't come across it yet.  A roller coaster-like ride in an old mine system is also great fun to watch - and the adventure doesn't end there.

3165163,3,B0016Q2D5M,"About once every decade or so the motion picture industry decides to revisit 3-D technology, and one of the properties chosen for this occasion was Jules Verne's classic JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Originally published in 1864, the story has been through more screen and television adaptations than you can shake a stick at--most famously in a 1959 big screen adaptation starring James Mason.  The current version, however, is not a literal adaptation of the novel; it is instead a modern riff that finds scientest Trevor Anderson (Brandon Fraser) using his late brother's notes on the Jules Verne novel in an effort to revive interest in his own dying university program.

With smart-alec nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and hiking guide Hannah (Anita Briem) in tow, Trevor stumbles into a cave that leads to an old mine that unexpectedly drops them to the center of the earth, where they find Verne was right all along.  Along the way they encounter a wild mine cart ride, a man-eating plant, a T-Rex, and lots of other bits of business designed to show off the 3-D effects.

3-D is really a big screen format, and when to bring it to the small screen the result is only so-so.  The glasses are as annoying as ever, especially if you wear glasses yourself; be that as it may, it works fairly well as long you keep the room completely dark and sit directly in front of the television.  You may have to move further back or closer to the screen for best viewing.  This aside, JOURNEY is a flyweight thing, well-designed, reasonably well-acted, but with a trivial script and story that exist only to provide an excuse for the 3-D effects.  Recommended if you want check out what 3-D is like these days, but never mind the rest.

3165164,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I love Brendan Fraser. I would see him in any film, even in one as awful as this. So if was difficult to only give this film a single star. But even the affable Fraser cannot save this bad film. This is a film that only a six year old can enjoy. Perhaps I should have had one to sit and watch with me. This film needed a little more attention to detail. A better script and less reliance on 3D visual effects. Perhaps then it would have  been an enjoyable, if mindless, entertainment.  My thoughts while watching my 2D DVD version was that the film must have been originally developed as an animated feature film. It has that ridiculousness in both plot and acting that seem more appropriate in a Saturday morning cartoon. For example, take the falling down the hole sequence. The main characters scream cartoon voices  and converse in whole sentences while flaying their arms as they fall endlessly downward. Sort of like 'Alice in Wonderland'. Another example is the sequence win which the younger hero (the oldest looking 13 years old I've seen on screen for a long time), traverses a chasm by hoping and sliding on magnetized boulders. The laws of physics be damned!
Worse yet, the DVD's 3D version uses the aged green/red 3D cardboard glasses technology that makes the film almost un-viewable.  If you somehow manage to sit through the complete film using these glasses, be prepared for a headache and sore eyeballs.

But it is alot of fun to watch the depth of this movie.  In contrast to what some reviewers believe, 3D doesn't mean stuff is constantly jumping out at you.  It gives the movie depth.  When you look down the hole and it looks like it is disappearing back behind your wall, that is depth. The movie is filled with layers of depth which make it much richer than a flat 2D image.  Yes, the pink and green glasses mess with the color, but you get sort of adjusted after a while.  I didn't notice a huge breakdown in sharpness as other reviewers remarked.  Sure, it would be great to be just like the movie theater, on the 4k dual DLP projectors, but the theaters spend hundreds of thousands of $$ to get that set up.  If you have the dough, go for it.  If you are a regular joe with a big box retailer TV, this is the best they can get you, for now.

3165166,4,B0016Q2D5M,"From the folks who brought as the Chronicles of Narnia films, Walden Media, comes ""Journey To the Center of The Earth"", starring lovable goof-slash-action hero, Brendan Fraser.  (I watched the 2D version, by the way.)

While this film doesn't have the deep spiritual overtones of 'Narnia', it does enforce positive family values and encourages bonds of relationships between friends and relatives.  If you're looking for a good adventure movie to watch with all ages without being worried it's going to be really gory or filled with unexpected sexual innuendo and laced with profanity, I recommend this movie.

The visual effects and CGI are top notch, and you really feel like there is depth to the cliffs, rockfaces and caverns.  The creatures in the movie are very well done, and include a drooling T-Rex, luminiscent birds and giant pirahna.  Because 'Journey' was probably done digitally for the most part, they really enhanced the color palette, and the colors are rich and saturated.

The acting is what you'd expect from a Disney-type adventure movie...no academy award performances here, but the actors give their best for what kind of movie this is...a fun, entertaining popcorn flick.

Just one gripe...Brendan Fraser didn't look like he worked out too much to get in shape for this movie and had man-boobs.  On the other hand, the cute actress Anita Biem from Iceland,who plays the lead female role, is a breath of fresh air and I think we'll be seeing more from her in the future.",1225756800,,1493,4.963855421686747
3165167,5,B0016Q2D5M,Was expecting not so great performance after reading other reviews and experiencing other 3D DVD movies. But this blu-ray version of this movie is simply superb. I am not sure if it is because it was Blu-ray because my earlier experiences were with the Shrek DVD in 3D. Wish there was an easier way to get hold of more 3D glasses as the Movie came with 4 pairs. Will be an interesting movie to watch for the kids when you have a movie night for your kids and their friends over at your home.,1225670400,4,491,4.23404255319149
3165198,5,B0016Q2D5M,"Before I write a short review on this movie please carefully listen to what I am about to say here.

DON'T ever pre-order from Amazon.  I pre-ordered this movie and paid over $26.  Only after a few days, the price went down $3.00 lower.  If you are not in hurry, just wait to get the best price.

-  Picture quality of the 2D version is not as good as other HD/Blu Ray movies I have seen.
-  Same RED/BLUE glasses like Spy Kid 3D or Shark Boy and Lava Girl.  You don't take glasses off during the movie.  Instead you put it on for the whole time.  If your eyes are getting tired, pause the movie for a moment, go to the restroom and come back.
-  I think the 3D here is better than the Spy Kid 3 & Shark Boy & Lava Girl.  It could be due to the movie is made on BluRay.
-  The story is simple.  After 10 minutes, the movie will take you to the journey.
-  This is the best 3D movie I have seen in term of the story and the enjoyment.",1225670400,2,933,3.836842105263158

My wife and 10 year old son watched this last weekend and it was a really cool movie.  It had some very nice visuals and a few ""jump out of your seat"" scares.  My entire family loved it.  Its also one of the nicest video transfers I've seen on blu ray.",1225670400,3,358,3.9305555555555554
3165201,4,B0016Q2D5M,"My 10-year-old son was mesmerized from the time the movie began until it ended. I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" fit the bill.

Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects.

""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.",1225670400,,1634,4.916666666666667

3165203,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Contrary to some of the other reviewers who found this movie shallow or otherwise lacking in depth of plot, etc., I'd like to point out the fact that this movie was the top family movie of the season; it premiered in spring 2008, and in my area of the country it was still playing past Labor Day.  Pretty good for a so-called ""shallow"" movie.  It is not the traditional following of the Jules Verne epic book, however, and is refreshingly original, although it interprets areas of the book and follows those who are fans of the original story.  In an age of continual remakes, this one sets itself apart.  My husband and I saw it 6 times this past summer.

That being said, I believe the bulk of the appeal during the summer season were the Disney 3D effects, which, unfortunately, do not translate over to the DVD version.  In the movie theater, for instance, one sees in the first scene a trilobite's antenna reaching out from the screen - at home, on my 60"" media room screen, the effect was completely lost, with and without the 3D glasses provided with the DVD. I tried watching the movie in complete darkness, hoping that would help, but it did not. I even tried the glasses I bought when I saw the movie in the theater - it does bring out a bit of depth, but not at all the cool 3D effects I saw at the movie theater. The 3D glasses which come with the DVD are the typical Blue and Red lenses which (in my case) just make my eyes hurt and really don't do anything special to the movie.  I prefer the glasses which were provided at the movie theater, though they do nothing to enhance the color of the movie, they do add some depth of field, but hardly a 3D effect.  It is the overall entertainment value of this movie that garners four stars.

The movie itself is very family oriented - no foul language, no overtly 'adult' banter; no excessive skin revelation (i.e. cleavage) and nothing the least bit gory.  Scary, perhaps, for small children is the scene with the dinosaur, but other than that, this movie is perfect for family entertainment.  We plan to show it on Thanksgiving to everyone after dinner, so confident are we that grandparents and grandchildren will enjoy it as much as the rest of us.

To sum it up, it is a good movie - not a blockbuster, but certainly entertaining - however the 3D effects were left in the theater.",1225670400,,2344,4.412993039443156
3165204,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Sure, I'll concede that this film hit the target for the intended audience. It's a family action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has much fast paced action, suspense and light humor.

You really have to divorce yourself from reality and even harsh criticism while watching this, because it's very easy for an adult with high-expectations to feel let down. But the truth is, this about the same type of fare as you'll find with films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang/dp/B000WC39ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apple-Dumpling-Gang/dp/B00009YXAV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apple Dumpling Gang</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Kids/dp/B000065V42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>, and so on.

My wife liked it and thought it was entertaining. However, I'm a fan of Jules Verne books and always have been. I guess I was hoping for more of an adult driven, Steampunk style (see comment below) drama than what I saw. I wish the CGI was better and the mood a little less cotton-candy-ish, but it really wasn't aimed at me and I can concede that. I'm not going to give the movie less than the four stars that it does deserve for the simple fact that with every scene, you can see that Brendan Frasier isn't overdoing the acting and delivers a family movie with a family movie level of acting. Kudos to him for being aware of what he was involved in.

This review is about not going into this hoping for an epic telling of a Jules Verne Classic, but going into it with the perspective of seeing a family movie. Hopefully this will help someone.

3165205,2,B0016Q2D5M,"First off I will state that I am not a fan of 3-D movies - ever!! But my husband is so I bought this for his 3-D pleasure while I watched the old fashioned way. His complaints, like so many other reviewers, were that all the glasses did was to make the picture look like red and green. I, however, enjoyed it in all it's 2-D splendor.

My ire was irked, however, when we opened the package. Therein we found a flyer with directions and a code for downloading the movie from our computer. This was accompanied by a blank, recordable DVD. NOTE: This is not good if the buyer is not computer savvy or doesn't own a computer - yes there are many folks who don't and I personally know at least 2 people who don't own home computers.

The next thing to vex me was the fact that once I got to the movie web-site I had to give them my credit card for a $1.99 charge to use their movie manager software which I then had to install on my computer. I was very tempted to just repackage the entire thing and bring it back to the store. But my hubby prevailed. We installed the software and forked out the $1.99 on top of the price of the movie. NOTE: Not a good thing if you feel the movie makers already charge enough for the movie; also not a good thing if you are at all hesitant about installing software from a company you don't know or trust.  NOTE 2: No where, and I mean NO WHERE, on the external packaging was any mention made about having to download the movie.

Once we got the thing into the DVD and on the screen we did enjoy all of the special effects but for me the entire thing was ruined by having to download and spend additional funds. The movie itself was a fun romp through some very futuristic special effects and definitely left itself open to a sequel for the actors since the teenage lead's next reading adventure, as given to him by Trevor, is Atlantis.

3165222,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I was watching for this at the stores, wondering why I was only finding the 2D version before now, so when buying milk at Wal-Mart there was the 3D/2D DVD together with a glow-in-the-dark yo yo at the checkout counter. I looked at the thing briefly just to make sure it was widescreen and I didn't see the awful red/blue (or magenta/green) eyeglasses I wanted to avoid either.

I saw this at the theater in 3D using polarized eyeglasses and wanted the same thing on DVD. I didn't realize polarized 3D couldn't be done for home TV until I read reviews here at amazon.com, wish I had known. Actually if I had given it more thought I could have figured it out eventually. Like someone else said, the DVD package shows colorless 3D eyeglasses. Very misleading if you had seen the movie at a theater and knew the differences in the eyeglasses, this means you can't avoid buying and opening the DVD box to discover what's really inside. I knew anaglyph two color ones were not good for long movie-watching. In fact, I was going to use the polarized ones I got at the theater anyway since those were like regular sunglasses (all plastic) and not paper and cellophane.

What's even worse about this... they put the 3D glasses in with the DVD itself so I found the DVD was scuffed from them rubbing against each other. My first thought was hopefully the 3D side was untouched, and it was, but now I know the 3D side is not the most important thing. I only got around to watching it tonight and the movie was almost unwatchable. Double-images most of the time-- and always when not the focal point of the picture (sometimes I couldn't decide where that was at)-- and colors messed up (as I expected from color glasses).

I enjoyed the 3D experience of JTTCOTE at the theater but this TV version is a poor attempt at keeping the 3D effect. I must admit it did manage to capture some good moments that would otherwise be missed in 2D alone. It was nice that the sepia coloration late in the movie made the 3D effect more pleasant to watch. The beginning of the movie was ridiculous by comparison due to the normal colors being fouled.

As to the movie itself, I think it was fun if not taken seriously. Obviously that was the intent, to be a fun movie. So when they are in danger it never seems like it really. Well, maybe a few different moments at most.

Terrible to know now that I can't ever watch any 3D movies the way I wanted to, in clear full color. I was going to start getting more of them if this had gone right.

If any of you would-be buyers of this DVD see the plastic 3D image on the DVD box first, well, you can probably judge the quality from that... and worse. IMHO buying a good 2D version cheap might be wise if you've been spoiled by the theater version, otherwise it can be a fun watch if your visual pain tolerence is high enough. The movie was plenty good at the theater so this DVD will disappoint many people, so I must say only get it for the adventure and laughs and such but not for the 3D novelty feature unless you never saw it before and can't resist the temptation.",1225584000,2,3086,4.348958333333333

3165239,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Fraser stars in the latest adaptation of Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" but the real star of the film is, of course, its special effects including 3-D images. Unfortunately I couldn't see the film in 3-D (the theater I went to showed only 2-D version), so please read my review as such, in which ""effects"" means only traditional 2-D special effects.

Probably you already know the film's story as you have read the original book or seen the 1959 version starring James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook. For the new adaptation the Hollywood studio decided on a story that they think is fit for effects. The new adventure story is much simplified: Brendan Fraser's hero Prof. Trevor Anderson is looking for his missing brother; Josh Hutcherson is his nephew Sean who follows his uncle's (and father's) quest; and Anita Briem is a mountain guide Hannah sgeirsson (a nod to ""Hans"" of the 1959 version?) whose father is one of the ""Verneians."" Actually the film is slightly self-referential as our hero finds a clue about his brother in the titular Jules Verne book.

And ... that is all. No ""villains"" appear (except, perhaps, a mean-spirited boss of Fraser's character, a very small role you may forget soon) as this is a family-friendly picture and each scene is obviously borrowed from other films like ""Indiana Jones."" The Jules Verne fans would lament, or even is angry with, the changes done to the source material.

Still as the film is fun. Yes, it may be silly kind of fun, but fun nonetheless as first-time feature film director Eric Brevig (also, visual effect veteran) has provided enough actions to keep the ball rolling. Even seen in 2-D the images are not bad if not great. Yes, I know, the characters are flat and its romance is uninteresting, but still I like the film for what it is, a 90-miinute roller-coaster ride.",1225411200,,1862,4.758513931888545

The good news: when you watch the movie without the glasses, you just see a normal movie. It doesn't have the weird double image of 3D movies of the past.

The bad news: the 3D effect with the glasses is terrible. I was expecting that the DVD would come with the same kind of glasses we got at the movie. Nope, we got the same old cardboard glasses with the red and green cellophane lenses.

The result is that when you watch the movie with the glasses, the colors are really distorted. Everyone looks like they've got a really bad sunburn, light colors are washed out with green. It's just awful. And the 3D effect isn't nearly as good as it was in the theater.

It turns out that my wife saved our glasses from the theater, so we tried them. No luck... no 3D effect.

This is a special effects heavy movie with the plot at times being nothing but an excuse for them.  But they were amazing.  And the plot works, too.  Yes, it's predictable, but it is fun, so that didn't matter to me.

Granted, it helped that I cared for the characters.  And the acting by the three leads was good enough to draw me into the story.

For all my praise, I do have two complaints.  The first is the pacing.  The movie took a little too long setting things up before the adventure really started.  Secondly, the ads for the movie gave away too much of the story.  I sure wish marketing departments would figure that out.

The film is rated PG due to the action elements.  It will be too intense for kids who get scared easily.  But any kids who can handle some suspense will love it.

So if you are looking for a family movie night, give this one a chance.  If your kids won't be scared by it, you'll all enjoy an amazing trip.",1225324800,,1980,4.304347826086956

I noticed POLAR EXPRESS is doing the same thing.  FORGET IT.  Stick to the memory of the REAL 3D in the theatre and watch the 2D version.  There is a technique that was used a few years ago for the Rose Parade on new year's day where the camera was constantly panning and moving and the glasses were left eye clear and right eye partially grayed out.  For some reason the messages sent to the brain caused a sense of depth (The JUDDS did a music video in 3D that uses this technique and was very effective).  I've also found that if I wear these glasses with a normaL 2D film, it will add a sense of depth to it and layering.  But red and blue?  Very blurry, ghosty and hard to watch.

3165258,1,B0016Q2D5M,"Whatever the merits of the actual movie, the 3D process used on this DVD (Green/Purple glasses) is simply awful. While the 3D might be great in the theater, this adaptation of the 3D to DVD is intolerably bad. Many 3D DVDs use colored glasses, primarily Red/Cyan or Red/Blue (for instance Spy Kids 3D and Polar Express 3D), but for some reason, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D uses Green/Purple Glasses. With these glasses, the movie is unwatchable due to brightness differences between the two eyes, and the lack of any color reproduction (like watching a black and white movie tinted green.)

Perhaps Amazon could take the time to inform buyers about the 3D system employed by the DVDs they sell. Some are High Quality Field Sequential (HQFS), some are Red/Cyan anaglyph glasses, some are Red/Blue anaglyph glasses, but this is the first I've seen of the Green/Purple system. I hope it'll be my last encounter!

Summary: Totally botched 3D conversion onto DVD! Stay away!

As a side note, many buyers are not aware that some anaglyph DVDs (colored glasses) can look quite good in the home, but only so on certain playback hardware configurations. If your TV is connected to your DVD player with composite video, S-Video, or a modulator (Ch. 3-4, etc...) the colored glasses 3D effect will look terrible. This is because these connections do not provide accurate color information.

The best playback setup would be a computer monitor (either LCD or CRT), or a DVD player connected to your LCD, DLP, or CRT TV set with HDMI or component cables. Movies like Polar Express 3D or Shrek 3D look pretty good with this setup. However, even with a great playback setup, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, is a disaster. Remember that the studio must do a proper conversion from the in-theater polarized source material into the colored glasses source for the DVD. This is where Journey 3D got flushed. Also the choice of Green/Magenta glasses seems to have made the conversion even worse. Although the conversion from polarized to anaglyph requires skill, it is not rocket science. Warner Home Video and New Line Home owe everyone an apology (and a refund) for this botch job.",1225324800,10,2180,4.836461126005362
3165259,3,B0016Q2D5M,"(This review is of the BluRay edition with 3D glasses)
I won't re-review the movie content: the main theatrical review is accurate and I agree with it.
I'm commenting on the 3D effect only.

The movie comes with red/blue 3D glasses (4 pair). The 3D effect is pretty good, but as with all red/blue 3D, the effect goes mostly into the screen, not out from the screen. Theatrical 3D with polarized lenses do both, but that is not technically possible with TV. But it is entertaining, none the less.

The big downside: you wanted a color movie, right? Well, red/blue 3D glasses essentially eliminate color. Everything is very muted, almost sepia in appearance. Look at the same scene in 3D, then in 2D (or just take off the glasses), and you'll quickly see what you are missing.

Overall, I wish they'd stop with this color-robbing 3D stuff on DVD and BluRay. It's a gimmick and removes the reason I have a color TV the first place.

3165261,4,B0016Q2D5M,"This is in regards to the DVD 3-D version of Journey to the Center...

Being a huge fan of the older version, (with Pat Boone), I was very hesitant about this film. However, when I saw that it was in 3-D, I was sold.
Turned out all the lights, put the glasses on and waited to be thrilled.
Well...until now the only video that had truely 3-D effects that I had seen was, 'The Mask'. NOT the Jim Carrey film, but a much older movie about a young man obsessed with a tribal mask. The 3-D in that was very good, in that you could actually see a hand coming out of the screen at one point.
Back to 'Journey...' It is 3-D through-out and it is very good. It is not the kind that makes you think that something is coming at you. Nor does it have the ability to make things appear as if they are floating in space. (I have experienced that in the theaters).

I was surprised that the manufacturer did not include ANY instructions for adjusting your tv for optimal 3-D viewing.
Because of that, we were seeing double images throughout the film. Sometimes getting a bit annoying.
I tried adjusting the color, brightness and hue, but to no avail.

Overall I enjoyed the movie and think that it would be worth watching again.
I wish the 3-D effects had been better. With that said, I will still buy the 'Polar Express 3-D'.
BTW: the tv used for this was a Sony 32"" HD.

The film may be a bit too intense for some children younger than 9 or 10. Most of it is alright for children. (Didn't hear ANY cussing). But, there are a couple of scenes toward the end that may be a bit harsh for some sensitive children. View it yourself first, then judge if it is appropriate for your children.",1225324800,2,1672,4.231974921630094

This movie is a treat to watch in 3D.  I love the floating rocks and the furious flying fish in the movie.

I really liked the special features on this DVD. It features a commentary on every scene of the movie with Brendan Fraser and the director Eric Brevig.  This DVD also features an interview with Josh Hutcherson about his life as a young actor.  There are some fun games to play based on the movie included in this DVD too.

Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?

Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.

Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.

Side A: 2-D in full screen and wide screen

I have no complaints here. The movie looks good and is still simple family fun no matter which version you prefer.

Side B: 3-D in wide screen

Here's my problem with this DVD as it compares to the theater experience. Most who watched it in the movies in 3D will be let down. The movie is a good movie, but not good enough to own. It was the 3D gimmick that made it awesome.

Here are the problems:

1. The 3-D effects are not the same as the way you saw it in the movies.
2. The 3-D effects are more like the gimmicky old school red/blue 3-D-ish movies from the old days.
3. And that's what you get, cheap red/green 3-D glasses that makes the movie barely watchable and truly disappointing.
4. I kept the old 3-D glasses from the movie theater hoping that I would be able to enjoy the 3-D coolness on my 47 inch HD LCD TV, instead I get a quasi 3-D gimmick that greatly disappoints.

Conclusion:

If you are buying this DVD for the simple pleasure of a fun family movie then by all means get it, but if you were expecting some 3-D fun then do not buy it. It will only disappoint you.",1225238400,6,1251,4.140495867768595

I was expecting it to be at least as good as Hannah Montana-Best of both worlds 3-D DVD but it blows that movie away. You use Red/Blue Anaglyph glasses for Hannah Montana but for Journey to the Center of the Earth you use Magenta/Green. WOW!!! What a difference on this movie. I tried using the red/blue glasses but they didn't work. I would say the 3-D effects (not talking about color) is as good as it can get without the huge screen. The things that are suppose to pop out at you really do. You can't expect the colors to be great because you are only using two color glasses so the colors won't be as good as the theater...but you don't notice it as much during darker scenes (when they are inside the earth) which is most of the movie. The surround sound was very good even though it does not have the TrueHD audio format...the rear speakers were very engaging. I will say that not everyone does well with 3-D some people get headaches but do those same people get headaches on amusement parks rides...if so this might not be good for you. For me, I love rides if it doesn't spin me around so for this DVD I highly recommend it on blu-ray.

*UPDATE* I now own a Samsung UN46C8000 3D HDTV and Samsung BD-C7900 3D blu-ray player and active shutter glasses...I can't wait until they come out with Journey to the Center of the Earth in real 3D blu-ray because the difference is beyond incredible.

3165278,5,B0016Q2D5M,I see a review complaining about it being just the basic red/blue 3D that has been around since way back when. This movie does not deserve a bad rating based on that. It is a great flick and you can NOT expect the same 3D you got in the HD 3D theater. The 3D theaters use Stereo Optic 3D which is still IMPOSSIBLE for home use. It would require you to have two projectors and the whole deal like the movie theaters which isn't cheap. It is a GREAT movie with a great little 3D overlay added. It is not as good as the new Stereo Optic 3D theaters but unless you have about 20000 dollars to hook one up for yourself I think you should be pleased.,1225152000,20,644,4.0390625

I'm the author of Walt Disney World with Disabilities, and I've seen every 3-D movie at all the Disney parks more times than I can count (Now those movies have incredible 3-D effects!). Unfortunately the effects in this movie were very weak. The 3-D rarely seemed to pop out at the audience. If it did, it lacked impact. There was so much potential, but it just wasn't used.

Now combine that with a very weak script, plot and character development, and poor special effects even without the 3-D involved, and you have this movie.

Sean: What?
Trevor: It's a metamorphic rock. Green shist, white shist, micro-guarded shist-
Sean: Oh. Shist.

This adaptation of the Jules Verne classic novel features Trevor, a goofy volcanologist (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, a canny Icelandic tour guide (Anita Briem).

While on a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland to retrieve data from a previously dormant volcanic sensor gadget, the trio emulates Alice by falling down a hole.  Curiouser and curiouser, they end up not in Wonderland, but in a lost world, where long-extinct phosphorescent birds flutter by and the flying fish have a serious case of overbite.

Using the storyline of a missing brother and misunderstood Vernian volcanologists, the little group wanders around the treacherous terrain, overcoming insurmountable odds and horrible hardship (Eat your Trilobite, Sean) before reaching the grandly preposterous finale.

3165302,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Fraser in ""Journey"" and in ""The Mummy"" is perfecting the role of the hero who is smart-dumb with a kind of a dizzy, dazed, sexy look. He's in action movies that have a light, bantering tone, but yet the stories have incredible creatures, scary chases, wild special effects, but a ""Look folks, no hands, only kidding"" kind of approach. This handsome, still boyish looking actor, manages to look terrified and can scream his head off in the face of danger. The character is bright, but you suspect there's a dumb streak lurking below the surface.
 He, a science prof, and his nephew, Josh Hutcheson playing Sean, go to Iceland where they join up with pretty Hannah, go climbing and end up falling to the center of the earth where there is a huge amount of space, plenty of light, a horizon, and apparently plenty of oxygen.
 Scary highlights: 1. Sean has to cross a deep chasm by jumping from one magnetic floating rock to another with one rock orbiting while he's clinging aboard. 2. Man-eating very toothy fish with real overbites attack the three on an elaborate raft that they were apparently to build in about a day without tools. 3. Prehistoric drooling monsters like raptors chase the uncle and nephew and almost gobble them up. 4. Huge, very hungry carnivorous plants attack Fraser and Hannah. Watch Fraser take care of the last plant, and you'll know why this is part braggadocio spoof.
 This is good escapist stuff that will entrance you as long as you don't start asking too many dumb questions. It's a thrilling adventure, scary and fun. Fraser is a winning action hero.",1220054400,2,1588,4.725631768953068

In my favorite sequence Hutcherson finds himself walking across huge boulders and rocks suspended by a magnetic field, hundreds of feet from the ""ground.""  He must jump from rock to rock as you would in crossing a stream, but with a much scarier potential fall.  It's hard to do justice to this part in words; you have to see it.

I like both movies.

Of all the 3D films I've seen, this is the best for several reasons - acting isn't sacrificed, the story stands alone, and the 3D is refined since a couple years ago.  I see 2 movies a week and so far this is my favorite of the year.

Warning:  The above review was written for the theatrical release of the film.  Now that I've bought the DVD it turns out they did not use the same excellent 3D system on the DVD as in the theatres, which used a new kind of glasses.

The actors: Branden Fraser is his usual affable, comedic, heroic self; although, he has starred in some dark movies, ""Gods and Monsters"" and the ""R+"" rated, ""Journey to the End of the Night.""(Stick with this journey.  He does this role so well.

3165328,4,B0016Q2D5M,"By definition, what you like or enjoy is subjective.  Whether or not something is of a certain quality is more debatable.  In between, lands films like this that you can enjoy quite a bit while readily admitting it might be one of the dumber films you've ever watched.  I would not dare debate the artistic quality of this film other than the stunning visuals and appropriate acting.  At the heart of most film is the story.  This story is so stupid and full of nonsense, that enjoying it automatically falls in the ""Guilty Pleasure"" category, only without the guilt.  Let's quickly chop it up to make this clear.

-OH SO STUPID!!
This film has so many scientific inaccuracies, so gleefully digs enormous plot holes, so often defies probabilities, so boldly slaps the face of logic and so blatantly ignores physics that suspension of disbelief is nearly forced upon you; ""Don't even START to believe ANY of this!!!"" the film makers seam to be shouting.  I accepted this like the sugar coated pill that it is.  Even with the stupidity, the concept was actually pretty cool; Jules Vern was using REAL sources.  My biggest complaint is they spent too much time developing a back story and a prelude to the action.  Even though those aspects weren't poorly thought out, it actually detracted from the bold stupidity of the rest of the film.

-I LIKE BRENDAN FRASER
Here's a guy who currently is really good at only one thing; playing the capable yet imperfect, attractive but not handsome, intelligent yet simple, irritating but admired, reluctant but heroic ""everyman"".  Talk about type-casting!!!  Other than his cartoon adaptations (bad ideas to begin with), I can't think of one film he's done that I haven't enjoyed a lot.  Whether it was ""Bedazzled"" or ""The Mummy"" series, I always feel good after watching his movies.  He really has a talent for acting like we think we would (or at least WISH we would) if put in the same situations.  The other actors didn't hurt this film either.

-LIKE A DISNEY 3D ATTRACTION
If you've ever been to any of the Disney theme parks, you've probably seen a 3D attraction of some sort (Honey, we Shrunk the Audience"" comes to mind).  Well, if you have, that is what this film is like for one and a half hours.  Anyway, needless to say, it's extremely cool regardless of the films inherent problems.  My kids were reaching for stuff coming out of the screen and my wife jumped out of her skin a couple times; a real thrill ride.  A lot of screams and giggles occurred throughout the audience.  As most have stated; without 3D this film is rather pointless but still ok.

-SET PIECE HEAVEN
After the initial (boring) set up, the film progresses from one cool and silly set piece to another.  Each scene plays out almost like a video game;
-Confront strange new environment.
-Solve the puzzle/beat the challenge.
-Move to the next set piece.
I have to say, this made it all a lot of fun without ever challenging your brain; sometimes its fun to turn your brain off.

-RECOMMENDATION
This is the first time I took my son to a film where he shouted out ""That was AWESOME!!!"" after a scene.  Though shamefully derivative and sometime scary, my kids absolutely loved it.  My wife and I had fun despite the unparalleled suspension of disbelief.  I would put this in a similar category with the original ""Tomb Raider"" film; a turn your brain off thrill ride.  The big difference is that this one is even less probable yet more family friendly.

For our part, the best of these was ""Journey of the Center of the Earth"". The story was a fun take off of the Jules Verne classic, by not trying to tell it as a period piece, and for my money, Brenden Fraser continues to be great as an action star.

Here's the funny thing though, the theater was out of the 3D Glasses so we watched it without the special 3D effects and still thought that it was a way fun ride! So much so, that we went back and watched it again with the 3D glasses so we could get the whole fun. Without the 3D we thought it was a 4star movie but with the 3D it was way a 5Star movie!

Without 3-D **

I find it more than a little ironic that ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", the new film starring Brendan Fraser and Josh Hutcherson, is being billed as the first ""Live Action"" film created in the new 3-D process. Ironic because this 'live action' film is basically as cartoonish as any animated film. But it is a fun experience nonetheless. However, if I didn't see the film in 3-D, it wouldn't be worth the time and effort.

Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a science professor struggling to keep his missing brother's research into plate tectonics alive, is quickly reminded that his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson, ""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""Zathura"") is coming for a visit when he and his mom show up on his doorstep. Mom is off to Canada to set-up their new home. In 10 days, Sean will board a plane and rejoin her. Sean's mom gives Trevor a box of her husband's things, because she can't bear to live with them any longer. Trevor realizes there are notes in his brother's copy of Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" and soon connects this with some plate activity that suddenly re-appears on one of their monitors. Trevor becomes excited and decides they have to travel to Iceland. Immediately. As they take the long plane ride, Trevor reads through the dog-eared copy of the book and announces, ""There is a society of people who believe Jules Verne's writings were real"", something Trevor and his missing brother apparently both believe, so he uses the paperback as a sort of map or guidebook (can Rick Steve's be far behind?). They soon hook up with Hannah (Anita Briem, TV's ""The Tudors"") and before you can spell ""Centre"", they fall through a small crack in the Earth. Thankfully, just in case we missed it, Trevor announces, ""I give you... the Center of the Earth."" They are soon careening down railroad tracks on runaway mine cars, trying to outrun living dinosaurs and trying to escape molten lava. And they only have a few days to do it; the area where they are is heating up and it will soon be too hot for them to survive.

""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", directed by Eric Brevig, a former special effects supervisor on many films, is a decidedly fast-paced film. While this is a good thing, the director is not able to handle this fast pace and the special effects, and at the same time also develop the story and character. I suspect that because this is his first film as a director, he is not able to handle all of these various elements with the same degree of skill. His work on the special effects for films like ""The Village"", ""K-19 The Widowmaker"", ""The Island"", ""Signs"", ""and Pearl Harbor"" provided the resume securing the job for him. The filmmakers were looking to create a fast-paced story, filled with thrills, which could be exploited for 3-D. Story and characters be damned.

The thing about Brendan Fraser is that he is always the perfect fit for these types of roles, the sillier, the better. He has the dashing good looks, non-threatening charisma, and silly charm perfect for these 'matinee idol' throwback type roles he seems to relish. Kids, tweens, adults, everyone can find something to like in Brendan Fraser. It also helps that he isn't a very good actor. He is always more enjoyable in films like ""The Mummy"" (and it's sequels) and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", loud, fast-paced movies surrounding the actor with a ton of stuff going on, to help distract us from his, at best, sitcom style of acting. When they arrive at ""The Center of the Earth"", Trevor announces, ""I give you... the Center of the Earth"". Just in case we missed it. The dramatic pause is also necessary to make sure we realize how dramatic it is. Not very subtle. The characters are almost always running away from, hurtling towards something or trying to escape some impending bit of danger. Because of this, they almost never have time to take a breath, let alone try to create a character or build any emotion.

Sadly, when Fraser plays a more normal person, with the lone exception of ""Gods and Monsters"", the characters are nowhere near as interesting. Yes, he is good looking, but unless he is shouting or running away from some CGI creation, he doesn't seem as believable somehow.

Josh Hutcherson has a more difficult time. Initially, Sam is supposed to be your typical teen, surly, uncommunicative and unresponsive. But he too quickly abandons this persona for the sake of the story. There isn't time for him to remain this way, because they have to work together to escape a dinosaur, or to navigate rickety mine cars, or to find their way out of ""The Center of the Earth"". He quickly coverts and joins the cause.

Anita Briem is pretty much negligible. You recognize the need for a female to be in the group, but the pretext for her to be around is shaky at best. During the course of the film, Trevor and Hannah are supposed to set off some sparks, but they fall into the same trap set-up by the filmmakers. Everything is moving too fast. There isn't time for a conversation to begin, let alone a romance. So when they finally kiss (like that's a surprise) it is extremely forgettable.

I was also a bit surprised that so much of the film is brown or orange. I know they are in the center of the Earth, but everything takes on this dull glow giving the film an almost monotone appearance and it looks washed out. After they arrive in ""The Center of the Earth"", a small blue bird appears. The product of CGI artists, this bird almost becomes a bit of a mascot for the adventurous threesome. But it sticks out, a lot, because it is so different in color and really draws you eye away from everything else. It also serves to make the overall color scheme stand out all the more and makes everything seem more brown, more orange and more dull.

Early on, the characters find a map which promises to point them towards a geyser they are sure will help them escape. As soon as this document appears, this becomes the main thrust of the narrative. Everything they do is about finding this geyser, never mind the fact ""The Center of the Earth"" is heating up...

Let's pause for a moment... At one point, Trevor realizes they are now in an area that is 115*. Yet, despite all of the running around, very little sweat...

They have to escape to the surface. And when they do escape, they pop up in a different part of the world. Initially, this is surprising, but if you think about it, ""The Center of the Earth"" would be smaller, so the fact they end up in... Wait a minute! I am wasting too much time trying to make an implausible story plausible. More time than the filmmakers spent trying to make everything work out. So when Trevor, Sam, and Hannah pop up in this other part of the world, it is done for laughs. Look at the funny local with his funny accent. Har-har.

As much as there is to dislike about this film, there is something about putting on a pair of 3D glasses that just makes it better. As soon as you slip those glasses on, you become a part of a collective group, a group that is about to experience something. As much as going to the multiplex to experience a movie is a group experience, and heightens everything somehow (comedies are often funnier when you hear other people laughing, dramas more dramatic when you hear sniffles), the 3D glasses make the whole thing even better. You're part of a group about to experience a ""new"" thing together. And the technology has greatly improved. There are no longer little red and blue lines around some of the images. The technology, while still not perfect, is more seamless and seems to be better for all people, whether you wear glasses or not. It's a lot of fun to sit in a packed audience with a bunch of friends and even more strangers and experience a roller coaster ride like this together.

So far, this technology has been best used for animated films like ""Monster House"", Disney's ""Meet the Robinsons"" and a re-release of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I think the technology still lends itself better to this medium. When watching live action in 3D, too many surfaces become flat and begin to resemble cardboard cut outs on different planes. In animated films, these same problems seem to blend in more generically.

Of course, it's the same journey to the center of the earth type story that you expect, but Brendan Frasier is good in these adventure flicks and the movie is neat.  3D is also great fun because they do little tricks that make things jump out at you so you holler.  Of course, they encounter dinosaurs and sea monsters and attack fish that make pirahnas look like minnows.

Just in case anyone reading does not know what 3D is: You wear special 3 Dimensional glasses to watch these movies (which they gave you at the theater).  Then objects in the movie have depth to them.  They stand out like the objects you see in real life, as opposed to objects appearing flat on a screen.

Of course, I think the fact it was 3-D helped some as the 3-D parts did cause the ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" and were neat to watch on the screen.  Watching objects fly out toward you and reach for you is always fun to watch.

Unfortunately, other than the 3-D effects, the movie wasn't all that great.  Characters are somewhat flat, there wasn't much you knew about any of the characters besides surface level details.

Also, the world beneath the surface wasn't fully developed and explored.  Sure, there were a few action-packed scenes (the ride on the ocean with the sea monsters, the chase by the T-rex, and the man-eating plant scene), but I felt a bit disappointed.  I was expecting to see *more* of this underground world, but there wasn't much given, before the main characters all leave to the surface.  Another thing that puzzled me was the little glowing bird that followed the nephew of the professor, Trevor, everywhere.  Oh well, it was a cute little glowing blue bird, but I felt it was a bit pointless and didn't do anything except make you, the viewer, think, ""Aw, how cute!!"" LOL.

I felt there also wasn't enough conflict either, not much struggle while they are in this underground world.  Not much going on, of course, I noticed a lot of people bringing their families to this movie so maybe the less unpleasant conflicts going on the better.

My opinion:  I think perhaps the makers of the movie decided to skimp out on a lot of substance and meat to the story and instead relied on 3-D effect to carry the movie.  It is easy to be distracted by the 3-D effects, and not notice that the movie is lackluster.

3165335,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

3165337,3,B0016Q2D5M,"""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" would be the ultimate theme park ride were it possible to build. So many moments of this film are as fast paced and exciting as an extensively themed roller coaster, with a lot of falling and flying and escaping set against the backdrop of elaborate special effects. This actually poses a bit of a problem: just as theme park guests ignore the story of a ride, so too will audiences ignore the story of this film. The filmmakers most likely did this on purpose, seeing as there isn't much of a story being told. It's all about the visuals, which can be experienced in 3-D if you go to the right theater (mine only offered a traditional 2-D presentation). There's nothing wrong with great visuals, but they're always a lot more tolerable when coupled with a solid plot. An attempt is made in this case, but it's weak even at best.

Those of you expecting a direct adaptation of Jules Verne's novel will be greatly disappointed, especially since both author and story are mentioned by name throughout the film. It's more of a springboard, a way for the filmmakers to tell their own story and introduce original characters. First, there's Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a disorganized but dedicated earth scientist. He teaches a college course no one wants to take, and his lab is understaffed, under-funded, and completely disrespected by the other faculty. Despite his problems, he remains passionate about seismology, volcanology, and plate tectonics, much like his brother, Max, who disappeared in 1997 while doing fieldwork in Iceland.

While his sister-in-law prepares to move to Canada, Trevor is left with his standoffish teenage nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson). He's also left with an old box full of Max's things, one of which is a copy of Jules Verne's novel marked with notes. Trevor compares the notes to his own scientific data and realizes that Max was on to something big; it seems that the world's most seismically active sites contain passages the lead deep beneath the earth, and this suggests that Verne's writing was not mere science fiction. Trevor and Sean immediately book a flight to Iceland to find Sigurbjrn sgeirsson, an earth scientist who had known Max and shared the same passion for ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" When they arrive, they instead find his daughter, Hannah (Anita Briem), an avid mountain climber. While she loved her father very much, she never believed Verne's book was anything other than fiction.

Despite having just met them, Hannah agrees to guide Trevor and Sean up a volcano so that Trevor can do a bit of fieldwork. A sudden thunderstorm forces them into a cave, and after a couple of hair-raising close calls, they fall through a thin sheet of rock all the way to Earth's center. They then discover a dangerous yet amazing world of glowing birds, magnetic rocks, carnivorous fish, gigantic Venus flytraps, still-living dinosaurs, and underground oceans. ""A world within the world,"" Trevor muses, realizing his brother and Hannah's father were right all along. Unfortunately, they have to get back to the surface as soon as possible. The temperature is rapidly rising, and they only have so much time before a volcanic geyser is ready to erupt.

I grant you that all of this is fun to watch, and while I was unable to see it in 3-D, I understood how the effect was supposed to work on the audience. The sheer number of objects flying towards the camera is enormous, pretty much to the point of being obvious. The thing is, I want more than three-dimensional images assaulting my field of vision--I want to be told a story, and I don't care if it isn't believable. The story for this new ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a bit flimsy, probably because it didn't seem like the actors fully believed what they were doing; their performances were restrained, as if they were just rolling along with the punches. Not bad, but definitely not great. If they aren't convinced of the material, how can the filmmakers expect the audience to be?

Nevertheless, the film has its moments. There's a touching scene between Fraser and Hutcherson taking place on a beautifully lit shoreline, and while I won't describe what happens or reveal what they say to each other, I will say that it felt the most authentic in terms of character development. And yes, the special effects are quite good, most likely because they didn't look completely real. Strange as it sounds, the last thing a story this preposterous needs is a realistic look. Take, for example, a frenetic scene in which all three characters coast through expansive caverns aboard runaway mine cars; instead of the tracks going in simple straight lines, they swoop and curve and suddenly drop. There's even a sizeable gap that they have to jump across.

My point is that it's more exciting for a film to be outrageous than to be realistic. However, it was annoying that the mine car scene was copied from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" a much better film in all respects. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" takes us on a ride and gives us plenty to look at, but it doesn't really give us anything to remember, certainly not as far as characters or story are concerned. I have no doubt that children will love this film, especially if they have access to a theater showing it in 3-D. But most other people will see it as nothing more than a mildly amusing distraction, a way to kill ninety minutes out of the house. See it if you must. See it many times in a row, if it suits your fancy. Some people love riding the same amusement park ride over and over again.",1215734400,,5623,4.738508682328907
3398398,2,B0016Q2D5M,"While Journey to the Center of the Earth will readily appeal to its target audience of youngsters and the easily impressed, its ridiculous story won't earn the respect of any longtime Jules Verne fans. The jokes alternate between rather amusing and blatantly failed, but the creative implementation of 3D effects pleasantly surprise, balancing out the whole Journey into a much more palatable affair.

Everyone knows you can't travel to the center of the Earth. Everyone except for publicly criticized science professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), who journeys to the mythical ""world within a world"" to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of this brother. Accompanying him is his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and their pretty mountain guide Hannah (Anita Briem) who will join in his fantastic adventures in a lost land of terrifying creatures and prehistoric danger.

Glowing hummingbirds, magnetic floating rocks, and giant carnivorous plants may sound pretty silly, and that's because they are. However, when such creations are thrown into a 3D movie they become spectacular moments of visual brilliance. Except perhaps the floating rocks. But Journey does well in its main reason for existence, and generates an ample amount of creative uses for its medium. From things jumping out of the screen, to more things jumping out of the screen, Journey wastes no opportunity to throw every manner of object or deadly creature at its audience, resulting in an abundance of visual stimulation and a noticeable absence on solid storytelling. At least the former was expected.

The true ""Verneian"" will be dismayed to learn that little remains familiar between this latest adventure to the Earth's core and the original novel. And while it may be unfair to compare it to the book or even the 1959 film, director Eric Brevig's vision often feels like an excuse to use a famous title rather than a sincere adaptation. Goofy comedy replaces earnest, though farfetched, explanations and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects. Odd musical bouts aside, the '59 version utilizes a human antagonist for an extra layer of depth on a film already submerged deep within the Earth's crust, and a race for discovery accompanies the challenge of survival. This new Journey substitutes in a young boy for a young man, a bumbling scientist for a genius professor, and an animated avian for an Icelandic handyman, but at least the female protagonist remains, this time in the form of a mountain guide. Unfortunately all elements of drama and romance take a backseat to the outlandish action and phosphorescent birds.

If curiosity (or the kids) gets the better of you and you must take this Journey, make sure you see it in 3D. Otherwise, once the story rapidly tires, the only thing you'll be able to fall back on is the headrest of your theater chair.

The inconvenience of baby-sitting his snotty nephew (Josh Hutcherson) does not deter him from learning what happened to his brother Max.

While trying to retrieve a sensor, a sudden storm forces the professor, nephew, and guide into a cave just as the entrance collapses, trapping them in an abandoned mine.  The mine proves to be the long way to the center of the Earth.
A few elements from the novel were misused here in ways the author never intended.  The use of the 3D gimmick hindered the visual effect of the movie due to the inherent need of the process (and filmmakers) to literally throw things straight at the camera/audience.  This effect didn't work during the 1950s and it doesnt work any better here.

3398435,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Gone are the days of the simplistic action/adventure film, and luckily Journey to the Center of the Earth was of the last treats this genre has given us. The plot and characters are simple, and don't offer a lot, but their simplicity allows for the viewer to be engaged into this world more. Each character is likable, and while the dialogue can be cheesy I find that's part of its charm. The pace is fast and the characters are in constant danger after falling through the Earth. A lot of the thrills and special effects hold up, some more than others, to make this a very enjoyable night in. Brendan Fraser is the king of screaming and being a badass. Plus you get to see him not only punch a plant but use his Hollywood muscles to tear it from the ground! I really enjoyed how Hannah, the main female character, wasn't the stereotypical girl in distress. She actually kicked butt more often than the boys and saved Faser's life on numerous occasions. The 3D in this film is great, if a bit dated. You can tell that some shots aren't as suitable for the 3D format, such as the quick editing in the beginning, but this was made at the beginning of the 3D resurgence so I'll give it a break. Especially since this 3D is better than most Hollywood movies today, because it actually dares to give you the pop out effect on many occasions, and on most of those occasions I found myself giggling with pure bliss in my heart, because the film along with the 3D made me feel like a kid again.",1501891200,2,1486,4.368231046931408

3398575,5,B0016Q2D5M,"The experience of watching Journey to the Center
of the Earth is like taking a deep breath of fresh air.
It harkens back to a time when there were more 3D films
being shot natively.  By this, I mean they were conceptualized
and designed for the format rather than upconverted in
post production.

What's rather odd is that Journey To The Center of the
Earth, as tremendously fun as it is, falls short of being the
perfect 3D action film.  However, when you discover that
most movies currently released on 3D Blu-ray consist of
upconversions, the film somehow manages to rise to the
top of ""must have purchases.""

I'll explain this in a moment.

I don't think the story is unfamiliar --- especially for anyone
who has read Jules Verne novel or watched the spectacular
1959 film this remake is loosely adapted from.  In this
modernized  version, Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan
Fraser) is on a quest to find his lost brother. With his nephew
Sean (John Hutcherson) at his side, they head to Iceland to
explore strange seismic activities that may be their key to
a portal that will transport them to the deepest regions inside
the earth. With the help of a beautiful mountain guide (Anita
Briem) and the Jules Verne book to guide them, the team
soon finds themselves living a real-world science fiction fantasy.

It's rather a shame that a terrific novel and a well-respected
1950s film was ultimately rebranded into a juvenile B-rated
remake that gears itself towards young moviegoers.  However,
that being said, I was awfully surprised as to how much I was
enjoying this popcorn flick, particularly for the fact that it does
come across as a wild, mindless theme-park roller coaster ride
with lots of WOW moments along the way thanks to its abundance
of 3D gimmickry.

By all rights, Journey to the Center of the Earth should have
been the Blue Ribbon prize winner for all the personal standards
I have set on what this format should provide to its audience. The
""In yo' face"" factor is through the roof here as the film certainly
succeeds at exploiting the format by throwing everything it can
towards the viewer.  The intent is certainly evident within the film's
initial first frames as we watch a woodlouse's antenna's poking
itself forward. From that point on, viewers should expect to be
bombarded with objects that include a retractable measuring tape,
a hurled-yo-yo, spilled molecular balls and a fallen flashlight (to
name just a few).  While some may consider the amount of effort
given to these thrown effects as ""cheesy,"" I think it works perfectly
for a film that doesn't seem to take itself very seriously.

So here's the problem:  Journey to the Center of the Earth suffers
from looking dated as far as what the 3D technology should look
like.  Sure, we are only talking about a film that is a few years old,
but for some reason, the quality of the 3D presentation falls just
short of being as incredible as it should.  Overall depth level is good,
but I felt it could have been a bit better. The film's intended 3D effect
work doesn't quite pack its intended punch.  For instance, most of
the more prominently projected objects lose their effectiveness due
to a slight amount of double-imaging as it moves closer to the viewer.
Even intentions to have objects seemingly dance before your face,
such as blown giant dandelion seeds, don't come off as effectively
as they should.

There are traces of ghosting to be seen now and then, but outside of
the protruding effect work, I didn't find it to be a constant problem.

Perhaps the problem lies in the overall murky look of the film which
is something that I am certain is intentional rather than a transfer
problem.  The outdoor scenes look wonderfully crisp, but once the
journey goes inside the cave, towards the center of the Earth, images
become rather subdued and cloudy resulting in a slight loss of detail.
The film's most climatic fast-paced action sequences that involve a
mine car or dinosaur chase, have a slightly smeared look to it.  In all,
I am rather disappointed that with all the effort put into creating the
film's beautiful cavernous world, its clarity is somewhat dulled.

The real show stealer here is the film's DTS-HD MA soundtrack which
is perfect in all respects.  This is a powerful, boomy audio presentation
with enough LFE activity to shake the entire floor during the film's seismic
events and action sequences (particularly a dinosaur chase).  Viewers will
find themselves completely immersed in the ambient activity that is
delegated to the rear channels where the subtle nuances of the underworld
(such as various drips and creaks) are effectively conveyed.

Journey to the Center of the Earth arrives as a single 3D/2D Blu-ray
disc housed in lenticular packaging.  In addition to commentary by
Brendan Fraser and Director Eric Brevig, there are 20 minutes of
family-friendly special features that include How to make a dinosaur
drool; A World Within our Own that looks at historical theories about
what lies below our planet's crust; Being Josh which profiles 12-year-old
costar Josh Hutcherson.  The disc also comes with an $8 coupon off
the admission of Journey 2 The Mysterious Island which opens in
theaters this February.

I have such a love/hate relationship with this 3D Blu-ray release of
Journey to the Center of the Earth.  I had never watched this film
previously, had low expectations going in, and it turned out that I
enjoyed watching this onscreen adventure more than any other 3D
film in recent memory.  It really captures that essence of being on
a theme park ride, placed in the middle of the action, with all this neat
stuff being thrown towards you.  For me, it's exactly what 3D is all
about.

The problem is that based on the film's low-budget effects, dulled
look and 3D technology that was about to be improved upon by
James Cameron, the film falls just short of being as tremendous
as I had hoped.

Still, somehow, Journey to the Center of the Earth gets placed on
my list of ""must purchase"" Blu-ray releases.  If you are buying into
the format for that 3D WOW factor, this just happens to be a film that
delivers it.  This makes for a perfect family film whose 3D gimmickry
will induce screams of joy from the kids.  What more could you ask for?",1453075200,,6274,4.782205746061168

3398584,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I bought the ""Journey to the Center of the Earth (One Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)"" because the movie is rated as one of the best 3D movies available for 3D viewing. This disc contains both (2D & 3D) versions on one Blu-ray disc. I do agree that this is a very impressive 3D Blu-Ray DVD movie, however there is considerable video noise in the form of white dots almost like snow or a fine mist that almost obscures the picture at several points near the start of the movie, lasting for the first 20 min of the movie intermittently. This is very annoying especially in 3D and is still quite noticeable even with the noise filters built into my TV at max. I recommend buyer be ware.

Buy another form of this movie and that's probably why the Blu-ray 3D (non-combo) only movie is much more expensive!!!!",1448668800,,803,4.462585034013605

3398660,3,B0016Q2D5M,"The French novelist Jules Verne (1828-1905) probably made a bigger contribution to the world of science fiction than any writer who ever lived, yet the cinema has most always treated him rather shabbily.  With the exception of Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" movies have handed us a range of silly, often low-budget permutations of ""A Trip to the Moon,"" ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" ""Mysterious Island,"" etc., and almost a dozen variations on ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" the most-famous previous film version starring Pat Boone, acting and singing.

Now, we've got New Line's 2008, 3-D production of ""Journey"" starring Brendan Fraser, hamming it up in full Indiana Jones, tongue-in-cheek mode as though he were still looking for mummies to dispatch.  Well, at least he doesn't sing at us.  Actually, this new ""Journey"" is a perfectly serviceable rendering of the Verne story for children, although adults may find it a rather juvenile, scatterbrained affair, with many of its shots intended more to show off the 3-D process than to further the story line.  For a pure, Saturday-afternoon, children's matinee adventure, it can have its moments, so the film is not a total loss.  Just don't expect to take any of it seriously, which must have poor Verne turning over in his grave.

There are several reasons why the movie didn't work for me, the primary one being that I am not of the age demographic the filmmakers were trying to reach.  Here are a few specifics:  First, Verne set his story in his own time, the mid 1860s.  The current filmmakers set their story in the present, the better to reach a younger audience for whom historical dramas might be a turnoff.  Either that or the filmmakers couldn't afford the period costumes and sets; I don't know.  Second, Verne's characters were a middle-aged professor; the professor's nephew, presumably in his late teens or early twenties because he marries his sweetheart when they return from their adventure; and an Icelandic man who serves as their guide as they climb down a volcano shaft.  The filmmakers, though, give us Brendan Fraser as the professor, a thirteen-year-old boy (Josh Hutcherson) as the nephew, and a beautiful young woman (Anita Briem) as the guide.  Again the filmmakers are targeting the youth market.  Finally, we get a whole slew of actions and special effects that the filmmakers intended specifically for the 3-D production, things that pop up about every ten seconds and have little or nothing to do with the story line or characters.  Be prepared for yo-yos, tape measures, balls, rocks, and all matter of debris to come flying off the screen at you.  And the fact that the events in the story are far more preposterous than anything Verne could have invented is probably beside the point; we have come to expect exaggerated theatrics in today's adventure movies.  Besides, Eric Brevig directed the film as his first big-screen directorial effort after spending most of his Hollywood career as a visual effects supervisor.  So what did you expect from the movie but a world of visual effects?

Otherwise, the movie retains some semblance of Verne's plot.  We do have the professor, the nephew, and the guide.  We do have the volcano in Iceland they climb (or fall) down.  We do have all the typical hazards for which movies like this have prepared us:  man-eating plants, man-eating fish, and anything-eating dinosaurs.  You know, the usual.

Don't expect anything to make sense, though; the filmmakers have calculated every calamity that befalls the trio to highlight some new 3-D effect.  If you're not watching in 3-D, much of the goings on look seriously dumb.  There's even a roller-coaster ride in mine carts down an old mine shaft, a ride similar to the one in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (and there's more ""Temple of Doom"" action toward the end of the movie when the trio slide down a mountain).

Frankly, I preferred the old Pat Boone rendition of the story better than this one; it actually had more realistic thrills, if you can believe it.  This movie is more like a Disneyland ride, the emphasis on the glitter and glamor of the CGI effects rather than on any kind of tension, suspense, or excitement.  Worse, much of the computer graphics aren't too convincing.  For example, the trio's raft venture on an underground ocean didn't seem too real to me, nor did some of the creatures they encountered.  Add in a flock of cutesy birds that seem to have flown in from a Disney cartoon, and you get a film that kids will undoubtedly enjoy at the expense of more than a few parents.

Oh, and in the best tradition of adventure movies everywhere, the heroine sheds more and more of her clothing as the story goes on.  But don't worry:  It gets a PG rating.

Video:
New Line provide two versions of the movie on a single, dual-layer BD50 disc in VC-1, both versions in 1.85:1 ratios that reproduce the film the way audiences watched the movie in a motion-picture theater.  The difference is that one of the versions is in 2-D and the other is in 3-D.

The 3-D presentation is wonderfully pleasing in its dimensionality and made the few minutes I stuck with it something of a kick, even if it seemed more dimensional than real life.  I mean, just look about.  Do objects in the space around you really have as much depth as they appear to have in a 3-D movie?  However, as I had found with the standard-definition 3-D version I watched several days earlier, I couldn't stick with it for long because of the 3-D cardboard-and-cellophane glasses.  They were just too uncomfortable to deal with for very long.  Now, here's the thing:  If you don't normally wear eyeglasses, the 3-D glasses are simply an annoyance on the nose.  But if you do wear eyeglasses for distance, as I do, the 3-D glasses are downright impossible.  I tried wearing them outside my regular glasses and got nowhere.  They wouldn't stay put.  Next, I tried wearing them under my own eyeglasses; again, no dice.  They actually hurt.  Worse, I couldn't get them to focus properly in either location, and after a short time I started to get a headache.  I remember having this same problem several years ago with ""Spy Kids 3-D,"" and I resorted to cutting the cardboard 3-D glasses apart and taping them to my eyeglasses.  Even that didn't work, however, so I didn't try it this time.  Instead, I watched the movie in regular 2-D.

In 2-D and 3-D, the first thing I noticed about the colors was that they had an oddly purple tinge to them, no doubt a result of the red-and-green colors used in the 3-D process.  These colors looked more than a bit washed out, too, no doubt another condition of the 3-D cinematography.  The second thing I noticed was that the image looked slightly soft in both versions, even though the Blu-ray high definition was significantly sharper than in SD.  Then I remembered that the filmmakers had shot the movie using digital 3-D cameras, so it is possible to attribute the lack of ultimate focus to the digital photography.  In any case, the disc's HD video quality did not impress me in 2-D, and in 3-D it was too hard for me to watch and too hard for me to focus.  I couldn't win with this one in any case.

Audio:
New Line's standard-definition edition of the movie came with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and I really expected more of the high-definition Blu-ray.  Alas, what with cramming two versions of the movie onto a single disc, it looks like the studio ran out of room.  Or I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt; I don't know.  What I do know is that any modern adventure needs the best possible audio.  Instead, we get ordinary Dolby Digital 5.1, which does about what we would expect of it and little more.  It displays a good dynamic response, strong impact, and an abundance of rear-channel surround effects, like creepy underground noises, bang, booms, creaking, and cracking.  There were times when it also displayed a small degree of harsh, edgy distortion, but these times were thankfully few.

Extras:
Besides making the movie available in two separate dimensional formats, New Line provide a few other items as well.  First up, there's an audio commentary by star Brendan Fraser and director Eric Brevig.  After that, there are three featurettes:  ""A World Within Our World,"" ten minutes of discussion on various hollow-Earth theories through the ages; ""Being Josh,"" six minutes following actor Josh Hutcherson around the set; and ""How to Make a Dino Drool,"" three minutes on the making of that particular effect.

In addition, the package contains four pairs of 3-D glasses; a digital copy of the film, compatible with iTunes and Windows media devices; twenty-one scene selections; bookmarks; a guide to elapsed time; a slipcover with a 3-D holographic picture on the front; English and Spanish spoken languages; Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
If your idea of a good movie is an amusement-park ride, then ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a good movie.  For kids, it should be great fun.  For this adult, however, it was something of a chore, in 2-D or 3-D, and not even the high definition helped that much.",1433808000,2,9200,4.779607346421786

3398750,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I loved reading the book, ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" when I was younger, it was an amazing story and it really got my imagination going!

This movie seemed to try to do the same thing.  We have a boring scientist played by Brendan Fraser who wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and prove that he wasn't crazy, and his nephew stops by for a visit.  Together they end up going on a trip that is essentially a replica of the one in Jules Vernes famous book.

The story is great, the acting is good, and the actors all put in a great performance, plus the special effects are terrific as well.  My only question is, when the T-Rex came upon the nephew character, it was in the middle of what looked like a barren wasteland.  So... what was this thing eating?  What was it living off of?  I didn't see any animals there that it could eat to stay alive, or even any plants in that area either.  It's just a little inconsistency that kinda had me scratching my head.

Stumbling across a previously unknown cave system, the explorers soon find themselves journeying deeper and deeper into the earth's core, on a rollercoaster ride into an unknown world populated by man-eating plants, lava lakes, and some seriously hungry dinosaurs.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Jules Verne once said Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real. And director Eric Brevig has done just that, as he has made the fantastic world that Jules Verne imagined come into a near-reality in his film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D. He was able to do this through technological advances made in stereoscopic 3D filming. I believe this was the first live-action film to be shot in 3D during the infancy of 3Ds return. While having the obvious intent of introducing us to what 3D can do and paving the way for the success of the 3D AVATAR, and this film also tells an enjoyable story that does well on its own even without 3D.

There's a lovely visual gag in Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D that sums up what's good about it. We're trapped in a chasm 20 minutes in, and Trevor Anderson [Brendan Fraser] is dangling on the end of a rope in fear for his life. He must be cut loose, or he'll pull everyone else down with him. Snip goes the rope, and he plummets about six inches, getting a light bump on the floor of an old disused mine. It's a big laugh, and such a simple, retro one it leaves you smiling for minutes.

The story is centred on the adventures of the Anderson family. Max Anderson [Jean Michel Par&eacute;] disappeared while on an expedition; he was never found and is assumed dead. The story begins ten years later with Trevor Anderson [Brendan Fraser], Max Andersons brother. He is a geologist, and the university where he works is planning to close down his lab. He has become so focused on his own troubles he had forgotten that he had agreed to spend time with his nephew Sean Anderson [Josh Hutcherson] before he moved away to Canada with his mom. So when Sean arrives, the house is a mess and Uncle Trevor is caught off-guard, having made no plans. Sean Anderson, who didn't want to be there in the first place, is not impressed. Trying to connect, Trevor Anderson decides to go through the box of Max Andersons belongings that Sean Andersons mum had left for him.  Amongst other nick-knacks and gadgets, they come across Max Andersons copy of Jules Vernes A Journey to the Centre of the Earth in which he had documented his final research prior to the expedition that lead to his disappearance. The information they find leads them to believe that Max Anderson had disappeared in Iceland while searching for a passage to the centre of the earth.

They decide to make their own way to Iceland and investigate what happened to Max Anderson. Together with newly met Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson [Anita Briem], the daughter of a scientist Max Anderson knew, they discover that he was searching for what most thought was only a fictitious story, the passage to the centre of the earth ""documented"" in Jules Verne's famous novel. They recruit Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson as a guide and head into the mountains to search for any signs of Max Anderson and his research. A wicked lightning storm  forces them into a cavern to shelter them from the storm, but the storm in its ferocity causes the entrance to collapse behind them. So having no other options the group starts their journey into the earth.

After finding their way to the bottom, or should I say falling their way down to the centre of the earth, they discover a world within the world just like Lidenbrock, the character from Jules Vernes book, had described. It is filled with an assortment of prehistoric creatures and plants, and covered with lakes and rivers. To reach the escape passage they seek, they must battle the harsh environment that surrounds them and all the monstrous creatures that call it home. Will they prevail or will their discovery die with them? To find out, gather your family and join the journey on this great family-friendly adventure, and don't forget your 3D Glasses!

Eric Brevig has hit this one out of the park, as his direction of the cast brings out the chemistry between the characters that plays out well on screen. Brendan Fraser is always a joy to watch on screen and I think the selection of this cast, especially for the three primary cast members, was extremely well done. I really enjoyed watching Brendan Fraser compete with Josh, who's just a teenage boy, for the attention of Anita, and while this could easily turn out to be a little creepy, they aligned the actor's and characters ages and personalities up just right so that it seemed natural. Eric Brevig also found a lot of ways to add to that third dimension of this film without sacrificing the story or character development. The show moves along at a great pace and does a good job of keeping your attention. Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is loosely based on a classic work of literature, but at no point does it take itself too seriously, it will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film is one that you can enjoy by yourself or for a family night, as the show is good clean fun with little to no language.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Both versions of the film are here in full 1080p encoded image quality, with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Depending on which version you're watching, the video tends to be a mixed bag. The 3D video image is outstanding and is also good in the standard 2D versions. Detail was really sharp and the cinema photography was choreographed very well. Director of photography Chuck Shuman deserves recognition for creating such a masterful piece of art work. I do have to complain about the lighting at times where they added some glow to the image in different shades of colour. That just didn't seem to look very natural to me, although it was the intended effect by the director. Other times they took short cuts on set and to me those were noticeable as well. The lighting works somewhat better in the 3D version and looks like a more natural presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I hope nobody has their pitchforks around when I say this, but there's no 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track for this release. Instead, we're given an amazing awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. This is a film that takes a journey to one of the most beautiful and bizarre places (literally) in the world, so it's no surprise that the audio representation for this release gives your whole system a pretty decent workout. There's a nice dynamic range that leaves voices easy to hear, and increases the volume during the action to a loud level that won't make your kids cry thinking their eardrums had burst. There does appear to be a little distortion once in a blue moon, which is kind of disappointing. You'd have to really listen for it, as it's nothing that's consistent by any means, but a high definition audio track should have been available for this release.

3D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Eric Brevig and actor Brendan Fraser: They provide for a jovial atmosphere joke session and quip their way through an otherwise thorough commentary, covering everything from Journey's development to its characters, visual effects, 3D shoot, and scenes that proved more difficult than either man anticipated. As audio commentaries go, this one is decidedly non-essential listening for all but the most pumped-up of fans.

Special Feature: A World Within Our World [2008] [10:08] An ironically shallow look at several leading theories about what lies deep beneath the surface of the Earth. It is the best feature, giving an overview of relevant historic scientific theory regarding the ""hollow earth"" used as the basis for Jules Verne's novel. Narrated by Anita Briem.

Special Feature: Being Josh [2008] [6:00] A day in the life of young Josh Hutcherson's experiences on set. We follow Josh in his trailer and on the set of the film. It's not really a fun watch, but your children might enjoy seeing someone closer to their own age behind the scenes.

Special Feature: How to Make a Dinosaur Drool [2008] [2:47] Features Josh Hutcherson, Eric Brevig and the men responsible for the horrible goop in question, explaining how they made and employed T-rex spittle. Finally, the set includes access to a digital copy of the film, so kids on the run can continue to enjoy the fun.

Finally, the 3D effects are definitely the icing on the cake and if your idea of a treat is having a woodlouse poke its antennae into your near vision, then you are in for a treat. But the best news is a nicely judged script that doesn't come off too aggressive - more gently joshing - and three actors doing the best they can to give it some personality. Brendan Fraser (who also produced) is an impressively unflappable stalwart by now at this running and screaming business, and his relaxed professionalism gives you the instant feeling of being in safe hands. When he tosses Josh Hutcherson some tome about Atlantis at the end, paving the way for another adventure rich with peril and pointy things, and it is a type of 3D film that is an enjoyable repeat viewing. I thought I might hate this film, as I have always been a massive fan of the original 1959 Journey To The Centre Of The Earth film, but I was totally won over and so pleased I have now added this to my Blu-ray Collection and if you want to impress people with a stunning 3D, then this is a very good 3D reference Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

My boys are older teens, and this show keeps coming back as something to watch again and again. **SPOILER ALERT** The storyline is good, and promotes some family values, and just to give an idea and see if it's something of your kids' tastes, the excitement comes from many scenes such as non-bloody dinosaur chase, storm at sea, and dangerous natural conditions (rocks, etc). The woman is fairly modestly clothed, shirt and short shorts, but she keeps it all on, and I didn't notice any zoom-ins on parts of her body, or ""checking her out"" in a sexual way.

3D:  now this is what merits the price.  When I bought my led t.v. on black Friday 2013, I immediately started looking for epic 3D movies.  When you search ""best 3D movies"" on Google, this movie constantly came up.  I took the chance to get awesome scenes.  Literally from within the first 3 seconds of the movie, till close to the end, there's 3D in almost every scene.  Very good 3D effects, among the best I've seen thus far.

If you like science fiction with lots of adventure, this is a good movie.  Once the three get on their adventure, they encounter all sorts of things such of things such as oversized dinosaurs that are very mean, man eating plants, fish that jump at you and try to kill you, magnetic rocks you have to climb over to get to where you're going, a awesome train ride, and lava.

The movie keeps your interest captured from the first moment to the last.

3398898,4,B0016Q2D5M,"The plot is simple enough: a trio of explorers discover an underground realm and they encounter different creatures and plants and terrifying obstacles. The story is nothing to ponder about: there's nothing philosophical or symbolic about it. But it's not trying to make a statement (or trying to be pretentious) about it. Journey to the Center of the Earth is strictly an adventure movie. The characters may be wooden, and the situations may be extremely preposterous, but hey, I did enjoy watching this movie. The special effects looked riveting, though watching it in 2D may have been a very minimal experience compared to the 3D that I could have seen. Still, the effects are marvelous. I did have a problem with the world underneath the earth's surface. The landscapes and creatures looked beautiful, but there weren't a lot of threatening beasts. There were sea creatures, Venus flytraps, and one T-rex: it didn't seem enough.

Anyway, JTTCOTE is a good adventure movie. The acting isn't that great, though Brendan Fraser gives his usual enjoyable performance. I'll say that you can watch this strictly for the visuals, the music, and cinematography. I haven't seen this movie in 3D, but I heard it's better than watching it in 2D. I can't really say myself, but I guess either way is fine.

3398920,5,B0016Q2D5M,"This is a great movie and I just had to write a review after seeing it. I can assure anyone who is looking for a great movie to watch and that is available in 3D ( I love Blu-Ray 3D but the selection is a bit limited )
That this movie is simply tons of fun to watch and enjoy.

The film is lighthearted in nature, and the acting is actually much better then I expected. Kudo's to the Director and to all of the cast. The 3D effects are amoung the best I have seen so far. I have been buying Blue Ray 3D movies and some of them are great stuff to watch, and others are absolutely awful to watch. No plot, worse acting, and no real 3D effects.

( I should add here that when I bought my 3D system, none of the reviews i came across mentioned the difference between passive and active 3D. So I bought an LG 47 inch passive 3D 6200 series TV. It was one of the highest and best ranked TVs.
Later I discovered that Active 3D has significantly better 3d effects. I didn't do my homework.. And nothing was mentioned regarding the 2 different types of 3D available when I was reading through Amazon product specifications either.  I actually was unaware there were 2 different types of 3D at the time. If I could do it again I would definitely buy a Samsung LED TV with Active 3D, and may still do so, while delegating this TV to a different room. But as I wrote above I should have done some research. Actually the LG model I did buy has some pretty good Passive 3D abilities and LG displays are excellent for HD movies also. so I can wait for a bit while pricing points start to drop on all of this 3D tech. As prices always do drop especially on TV systems. )

Anyway I wanted to include the above information because even on my passive 3D system, this film had tons of great special effects flying out of the TV and aiming right for me...  I actually tried to block an image of a small rock that was flying right at me, instinctively.. Pretty amazing for a 3D passive system. I can only imagine what this film would be like with Active 3D tech.

So I highly recommend this film for everyone, its not violent, its not scary! It is very engaging for the type of movie that it is. And it has some suspense filled moments. It has been done with an overall sense of very good Humor throughout the film, and has, of course, the usual but well managed love interest theme going on throughout it.
Getting into the great mood and the upbeat rhythm of this film is easy to do and its a great 3D movie on an early Saturday evening type of movie. It has a really good sound track as well.",1379116800,,2572,4.144288577154309

If you like Brendan Fraser, adventure movies, Jules Verne, or Josh Hutcherson, this is a wonderful movie. It's great for the whole family.

But just the same, it was good campy fun watching it in 3d at home (our first foray into 3d movies on the new 73"" 3d TV). There were a number of cool 'pop out' scenes to really get you going; in one scene, someone lit a road flare, and while gripping it in hand, they suddenly thrust their hand straight at the viewer, my wife and I both jumped out of the way as it looked so real coming straight out of the screen into your face. In another scene we caught ourselves swatting our arms as these little bird like creatures seemed to infiltrate our living room! Kids would probably really enjoy this experience.

It works pretty well on my 55"" Flat Screen, although the colors are somewhat duller than playing it as a 2D.  It comes with 4 sets of cardboard glasses which are small for my adult head.  I cut the ear hooks off a pair and taped on an extension and it worked fine.  Anyway, it is a novelty seeing the 3D, but with the new technology out now, I think you will have to buy the equipment to see it in the future and get an even better experience for it.",1361145600,,580,3.956896551724138

Overall the movie was decent, light hearted and entertaining, the big selling point to Mr seas the 3d, it was clear the movie was directed with the idea of 3d in mind. The look of the 3d was very convincing, and there were several effects that came well out of the screen (I flinched several time because it seemed like something was about to hit me)

3399008,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Let me get this out the door: Journey to the Center of the Earth is a very cheesy and campy movie. It is has the most clich one-liners, and corny dialogue. Yet, that doesn't stop the movie from being an exhilarating 3D adventure. For those that are fortunate enough to own a 3D TV, the 3D in this movie is very fun. Depth is always there, and there are some fun pop-outs through out the movie (Yes they know they are gimmicky). Within the first minute of the movie, there is an awesome pop-out that stretches way out of the screen. The picture quality is another story, during some scenes, there is a pinkish hue, a blueish hue, and a greenish hue that really takes away from the picture quality. However, if this doesn't bother you, i highly suggest buying this movie. At $14.99, it was a steal. However, I am not sure if this is still the price. I would pick this up if you found it for under $19.99.",1359763200,,902,4.280701754385965

3399063,1,B0016Q2D5M,"Only Hollywood could turn a campy Jules Verne masterpiece into something so incredibly boring! Where's the story? It just vanished into thin air. You certainly have plenty of acting talent. It's too bad it was wasted on such a vapid screenplay. And the sets are colorful. But that's about it! Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching planes land and take-off at an airport. Sure some people may find that exciting, but most people don't.

If I had to sum up this film, I would say it lack's heart. The writer's of the screenplay certainly went out of their way NOT to do, or say, absolutely anything to offend anyone! This is the ultimate perfect film for small children. It's so plain vanilla, parents will have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, for the rest of us, it wasn't marketed as a children's only film!

I don't expect a Jules Verne story to make sense - it's a delightful fantasy. But the versions I remember as a child & teen had very convincing passion and a lot of imagination. Memo to Hollywood: When you make the next remake sometime in the next twenty years, dump the plain vanilla into the compost bin, and take walk on the wild side!

My favorite phrase in the whole movie is when Brenden Fraser looks at his nephew just before they are about to go down a very dark tunnel and says:  ""Cowboy up!""  The nephew then squares his shoulders and goes in.  Everything in that expression sets the tone for what that boy is going to have to do over and over.

Now we are presented with ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.

Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.

I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.

Now it was time to watch the 3-D version. , I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat.  Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.",1341187200,,1884,4.502941176470588

There were some campy over-the-top action sequences that would normally leave our heroes with shattered vertebra but it all fit in with the type of classic film genre that this movie represented.

The visual effects quality in this film were light and were more TV grade than theatrical film grade but, I'm glad the producers kept the cost of production under control so that this film could by profitable and it looks like, in the world wide box office, it was very profitable.

I also liked how this film had no profanity or gratuitous sex and violence.  This is a very family friendly film that can entertain the kids and their parents.",1338508800,,940,4.777777777777778
3399109,2,B0016Q2D5M,"This movie..wow. The book by Verne was nice, and so was the beginning to this movie. I immediately got a horrible taste in my mouth when I saw them on this silly adventure in the railway cart. It was then that I knew that this movie was not a real adaption or a serious one but rather a spoof either intentional or not.

Rather than going on about how much of a Disney movie it turned out to be with a good beginning, let me go over a few problems I had.

1) When they were going out the water blast at the end, are you seriously telling me that they were perfectly aimed at the top to where they didn't clip the side and go tumbling up?
2) The kid stored a prehistoric bird in his bag and it didn't die of either cramped space or something similar? You hide a bird in the small pocket of a bag and you tell me what happens.
3) The graphics are worse than a movie made about 12 years before in Jurassic Park. Really?

There are many more complaints. The 2 stars are for the beginning of the movie and the beautiful actress who, in real life, would NOT have fallen for the main character in such a short amount of time.

Really, if you are a kid then maybe this movie might suffice. If you are an adult then no, this movie won't do. It feels rushed and we as viewers should demand better. How is it that Jurassic Park had better graphics than this movie? That just bites me in negative places..

I was blown away! I had recently purchased a 70"" Sharp Aquos 3D HDTV along with a 3D discs of ""Hugo"" and ""Harold and Kumar Christmas"", both which I saw in the theater and enjoyed. I had never seen ""JTTCOTE"" and bought it strictly on others' recommendations. It was a very wise decision. The 3D is nothing short of amazing. And the movie itself is a lot of fun too. It's an ideal family film. It's not too long, about 90 minutes, unlike ""Hugo"", which although is a great family film also, with a running time of about 2 hours, younger kids may get restless. Also, this 3D Blueray disc has a great surround sound, which adds to the thrills and excitement. All in all it is the definitive ""fun"" movie. Get the family together and have a great time.

Today you can get a proper 3d version that is actually cheapet to buy than this one is.  I would make sure to ask which version you are getting. The newer 3d version needs a 3d tv and 3d player and it looks outstanding. The older version which uses the old style glasses is ok but it can't compare. In fact using the red and green glasses causes a ghosting effect, (images seems to have lines around them or a fainter second image) this is ccmmon and normal when using those old style glasses. SO you don't want to pay 35.00 for that version, while the version with the 3d logo on it looks great as you will have the black glasses and a three d tv.  The story isn't as good as the 1959 version which is coming out on blu ray in 2012, but it's fun and a romp with effects from the 00's decade so that's a bonus.  It's got extras too. But I would certainly not waste your money on a older 3d version with green and red glasses unless you don't ever intend buying a 3d tv. That would be a mistake though as the format is outstanding. SO make sure to ask which version you are getting. The older is more exp3ensive because it was in print only a few months and lots of people complained abou tit and it was yanked out of print.

So all in the spirit of fun I find that this Brendan Fraser version is a keeper for me. I enjoyed the regular DVD version initially...until I upgraded my television set. I just bought and watched the 3D verstion of this movie and even though I found the 3D glasses a bit difficult to wear throughout the movie, doing so was worth it. While I believe there is still much work to be done on the quality of 3D movies in general, I found the depth and the ""pop-out"" to be delightful experiences and I plan to purchase a few more select 3D movies.
As far a this version of the Jules Vern Classic, this was my favorite as Trevor Anderson (Fraser), his nephew make a breakthrough discovery and a breakthrough in their relationship that improves the story for me.  This predictable ""never-before-seen world"" (except by Hollywood and previous versions of this story) holds a few new twists and turns as well as an ending that works for me.",1334707200,3,1052,4.473958333333333

The packaging is very nice and is about the right size for a DVD. I have also found that CD's fit nicely into the box.
The film itself is not actually a documentary about travelling to the center of the earth however. I was expecting a David Attenborough type in depth programme with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. I was also dissapointed that the film is old style 3D not compatable with modern 3D tvs, but after a few attempts of squinting, or closing 1 eye and even blinking rapidly all failed i discovered that if you stand as far away from the television as possible and then run towards it, its like things are flying out from the TV at you.

 However after getting the bluray 3D version I was impressed at just how much my opinion of this movie changed. Being made as a pure 3D movie when it hit theaters this version is outstanding. As a rule many movies are somewhat darker as we were the Polarized Glasses. However this was not the case with this version. It is one of the brightest (if not the brightest) 3D titles that I have. As far as movies go the only other title that I have that is as bright as this is Captain America. Do not get me wrong...I have numerous titles that are in 3D but most are CGI movies...Monsters Versus Aliens...MegaMind..Shrek..Dispicable Me..Avatard has a ton of CGI but just not as bright. That's why I say the only other ""Movie"" that is comparable is Captain America. As far as brightness it all varies on the type of equipment one has, I have a Mitsubishi so yours may be brighter than mine.

 My 5 star rating is based solely on the 3D and while it may not have the most out of screen effects the quality of 3D turned this from borderline 3 star viewing to something I will be able to watch several times.

3399169,2,B0016Q2D5M,"Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).

But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying ""Go for it, go for it!""

Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.

The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.

I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film ""Gods and Monsters.""  What did he do to deserve this mess?  Presumably he was well paid for it.",1329868800,,2703,4.518518518518518
3399170,5,B0016Q2D5M,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 25 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, 44 effects between 25 and 30%, 6 at 40%, 3 at 50% and 3 more around 60%. If I had to pick just 3 of my favorite effects from this film, they would be the biting fish at up to 30%, the carnivorous plant around 35% and a glowing bird that flits around between 25% and 40% for about 20 seconds. There are lots of other nice effects for you to pick your own favorites from.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
The depth is, for the most part consistent from scene to scene and is natural to SLIGHTLY exaggerated looking because the footage is so crisp and clear. In fact, the live action 3D is done so well that in some outdoor scenes, the fact that it is actually an indoor set or green-screened, becomes noticeable. (Did I just complain about 3D being done too well?? Must be a full moon or something. LOL)

This is a great action/fantasy film suitable for most family members (rated PG) and I will enjoy watching this movie many times in the future. It easily makes it into my top 10 (out of 100) blu-ray 3D movies.
I should add that this is NOT a 2 disc combo set. The Amazon title is wrong, their ""Product Details"" are correct.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
On my system, in addition to some slight ghosting that most people shouldn't notice, 5 scenes had easily visible crosstalk. I'm not trying to scare you away from this title. It's not perfect but still well worth adding to your collection.

3399196,5,B0016Q2D5M,"I would say that this is my very.. very.. best 3D movie ""EVER"".  Now we are finally in the new generation of ""3D"" TV.  This movie is what the REAL 3D picture is suppose to look like (pure, clear and crisp).  You couldn't ask for better.  Picture quality was 10 stars and 3D images were ""genious"".  Lots of ""pop outs"" which is hard to find in most 3D movies that are out now (so you'll appreciate this one!).  Keep in mind, this movie is for family viewing and very adventurous.  In my opinion, 3D movies are at it's best in adventurous.  I can't see a love or drama movie being made in 3D (LOL..).  However, I hope they keep it coming with more adventurous movies like this.  You should own it, you will NOT be disappointed.

One of the best 3D movies so far in 2012.  Whoo.. hoo...",1328054400,6,782,4.20945945945946
3399197,5,B0016Q2D5M,"First some back-information on the releases..

Journey to the Center of the Earth has been released in at least 3 different Blu-Ray versions now:
Blu-Ray 2D (with 3D anaglyph (green/magenta glasses) + DVD + Digital Copy
Blu-Ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy
Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray 2D

The original Blu-Ray 2D w/ Anaglyph 3D wasn't so great, mainly because the required green/magenta glasses which made the video look terrible (it also showed much more ghosting and the 3D was nice but hard to watch an entire movie). This release was later replaced with a 2D only release.

The 2012 release is a REAL Blu-Ray 3D release (requires a 3DTV). The release is a single-disc with both Blu-Ray 2D and 3D versions on it (there is no Anaglyph version on here, so you will need a 3DTV to view it in 3D). It's also worth noting that there is no longer a DVD or Digital Copy included (There was, however, 8-dollars movie money for the 2nd movie coming out in early 2012).
The 3D Blu-Ray release includes a lenticular cover.

MOVIE - I found the movie to be fun. Not a great movie by any means, but works nice as a ""turn your brain off and just enjoy it without thinking too much about it"" way. Nothing terribly memorable, but also more watchable than most of these movies (and I think a bit of that comes from the 3D - I originally watched it in 2D, but enjoyed it much more in 3D). At 92 minutes, it also doesn't drag on like some movies.

AUDIO - This is an improvement over the original Blu-Ray releases which only had Dolby Digital 5.1 -- the 3D Blu-Ray now has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 -- audio was very nice, didn't notice any issues with it.

VIDEO - Video was also good - the colors seemed a bit odd at times, but still very watchable. An above average transfer.

3D - Here's where the movie really shines. The Movie was filmed in 3D and combines live action and CGI elements very well. Lots of depth, lots of popout (a lot of gimmick popouts also, which I enjoy). I didn't notice ghosting/crosstalk during it (Panasonic DT30 LED TV with shutter glasses), something that is obvious during some movies. Depth seemed very natural and showed good separation.. sharpness was also very good. It was very obviously 3D the entire time, unlike some movies which seem as though 70% of them could easily be in 2D (and quite a few newer releases are just converted to 3D (this one was shot in 3D)). I'd rate it near the high end of 3D releases currently available.

Extras - Extras are sort of thin (same as the original release) - biggest being the commentary. The 3D release also includes a lenticular slipcover.

Overall - Not a great movie, but a fun movie. If you've seen it before and liked it, you'll like it much more in 'real 3D'. I owned the prior release (2D+Anaglyph+DVD+Digital Copy) and was still very happy with this new release. Recommended!",1326844800,88,2832,4.4728682170542635

I look for any debris and dust as I take very good care of my optical disks but found none.

No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.

Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.

Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)",1314144000,,900,4.54320987654321

3399210,3,B0016Q2D5M,"I've read the Jules Verne classic book and watched the 1959 movie version as well as the lamentable 2008 made for TV version and it occurred to me that the best movie interpretation would be one that doesn't take itself seriously. The Jules Verne book really is quite silly and totally unbelievable and it hardly seems possible to make a movie interpretation that is both true to the book and serious. It was with this in mind that I had hopes for the Brendan Frasier version, not HIGH hopes but hopes. The film starts off well enough with Brendan playing a school teacher whose brother Max was lost 10 years ago while searching for the center of the Earth following Jules Verne's novel (a bit of meta fiction). I won't go into the details but Frasier and Max's 13 year old son end up traveling to Iceland to find Max in the legendary Mt. Sneffels with the help of a beautiful Icelandic guide.

I was totally expecting brainless silliness and man did this film deliver. Rather than have our heroes hike for weeks or months into the Earth it's all one big Alice in Wonderland type drop that deposits them I guess hundreds of miles into the Earth. I won't spoil how they survive such an absurd fall. The movie is all one big roller coaster ride that occasionally descends into a LITERAL roller coaster. It really reminded me of one of those 80's summer blockbusters where you buy a big box of popcorn and power down your brain. There's no tension because the characters are all as indestructible as Wile-e Coyote and the whole world seems designed to keep them safe from harm with walls of rock that can be smashed through for easy escape. It's sort of like an MGM back lot adventure show with about as much depth and dignity. This is not to say that it's not enjoyable but it's basically a cartoon with human actors.

What I didn't expect from this film was the terrible special effects (I did not watch this in 3D). The CGI dinosaurs were better in Jurassic Park back in 1993 and the blue screening is so bad you never feel like the actors are anywhere but a sound stage. Many of the action scenes looked like bad video game graphics and REALLY pulled me out of the film. The films 60 million dollar budget is modest by today's standards but it isn't THAT modest. Tron: Legacy had a 170 million dollar budget and you see every penny of it and the CGI world is totally believable. Here it's just laughable. This is DEFINETELY my biggest issue with the film.

The pacing of the story here is a complete departure from the book which was an underground journey of many months. I would estimate that in this film the group was underground for MAYBE a couple of days. You never see them eat or sleep or for that matter show any exhaustion. Despite the fact that Max had gone lost a decade earlier it's only NOW that the heat starts to spike in a lame attempt to increase tension. The temperature rises well above 110 degrees F but you never see anyone show fatigue or sweat. After some adventures with prehistoric piranha's, man eating plants and a T-Rex the group shoots out of the Earth just as swiftly as they descended, out the top of a volcano (sadly that bit of silliness actually is true to the book).

This film is really dumb. Max's son gets a phone call on his cell phone from deep within the Earth despite cell phone's propensity to lose connection even in an elevator or stairwell. Brendan Frasier punches out a plant and they discover what appears to be a hyper intelligent bird who helps guide the group to safety. I wouldn't say that I completely wasted 93 minutes of my life but I probably wouldn't bother watching this film again if for nothing else than the special effects are so bad. The film is far better than the 2008 TV version that leached off this one but the best is still probably the 1959 version.",1306972800,3,3821,4.454285714285715

Not only was it not interesting in the least, but it was very boring. This paint-by-numbers action/adventure movie is so inorganic and artificial that you'll be craving a sense of individuality when it comes to this movie. Unfortunately nothing sets it apart from the rest, and it ends up being a bad B-movie through and through. The fact that the point of this movie is to read the book it's based on is consistently hammered into viewers' heads to the point where it actually seems like a better option. Being someone who has read the book, I can tell you that it is 100 times better than this movie.

For those thinking about seeing this or those who are fans of Brendon Frasier, imagine a crappier, uninteresting version of The Mummy, and that's what you get here. The characters aren't fleshed out at all, their motives are very poor and not explained well, and overall this movie has no substance to it at all.

Accompanying him on this quest is his brother's son and the daughter of a deceased vulcanologist who also was a determined Vernian).

I have to say, this is one of Brendan Fraser's better films.  He's still got a couple of cheesy moments in the film, however most of his acting was right on.  The character development of characters played by Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem was remarkable.  He went from being a snobby brat to a more humane and likeable person without much character degradation.  She went from a serious, practical mountain guide without much faith in her father's beliefs to an realization that both her father's and other Vernian's views have merit and truth which she sees for herself.

The problem was convincing my husband and son that it would be worth watching. Finally, I found Amazon had it marked down to a reasonable price on Blu-Ray and I ran my pleas with my family one more time to snatch it while we can. My husband agreed this time, because he's so wonderfully sweet. His response was, ""Sure, get it if you want."" I bolted from the room and ordered.

Brendan has become one of my favorite actors ever since I saw him in The Mummy. I had no clue he was a naturally talented actor who does comedy mingled with action/adventure so well. Journey made me think a lot of his role in The Mummy and that's what really hooked me. In Journey Brendan (Trevor Andersen) is a scientist. One weekend, his late brother's wife brings his nephew for a visit and drops off some stuff for him that once belonged to his brother. Inside the possessions, he finds Jules Verne's book, Journey to the Center of the Earth, with clues written in the margin by his brother (also a scientist) which sends Trevor and his nephew off for an adventure of a life time.

If you're a Fraser fan, then I'm certain you'll enjoy this and too boot it's fairly family oriented.

This is a good family film. We were able to watch it very comfortably with our 9 year old grand-daughter.

The movie, which is about three people trapped far beneath the earth with prehistoric plants and creatures, is both exciting and funny. The main characters are all likable, and Brendan Fraser is at his charming and funny best.

Sadly, even if you do all the work to correctly track down the 3D dvd version of this film and the 3D glasses. it won't do you much good. The home 3D presentation doesn't exactly jump off the screen at you, so my advice would be to skip the extra trouble and expense that I went through to that end.

Suspension of disbelief is no greater for this 'follow-up' film than it was for the Verne book or for the original movie with James Mason and Pat Boone. The special effects are good, and the same solid dinosaurs about to eat people type that you've come to appreciate ever since Jurassic Park. The story is NOT meant to be a cover of the Verne book, it is sort of a sequel, in a way. That element of the movie was handled in a very interesting fashion.

This has spoilers...(for those of you who are thin skinned about reading reviews and then complain because you read reviews which included the storyline.)

I loaded up a 5 disc DVD player and put this one in last because I didn't expect much out of it... and to my surprise, it turned out to be the best movie in the stack. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a while. I bought the normal DVD version of Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser. Nothing fancy. This was not a 3D version.

There really was not a boring moment in the entire movie. It was fun, interesting, well written, well acted, well directed and had wonderful visuals and special effects. It was all unique and refreshing. I was glad they did not sour the movie with a bunch of unnecessary and unbelievable subterranean tribes or inhabitants like we see in other movies like this.

Definitely a great family movie. No violence... other than that of the creatures they encounter... but that was also a nice feature. No blood, gore or killing of any characters in the entire movie. I really get tired of that in other movies. It is amazing how enjoyable a movie can be without those things.

The story was fast paced, kept our interest and exciting to watch. The movie didn't dawdle too long in any one scene. The scenes were fresh, exciting and innovative and not repetitive of any previous movie versions. Anyone who has read my previous reviews knows I do not give out a review like this which is all positive. I usually have complaints even on my most favorite movies... but no negatives on this one on any aspect of it.

For those of you who care about these things... the dialogue and gadgets were technically up to date with the times. So you won't have the teens complaining about it being old fashioned. But at the same time, it met all of the needs of the older audiences as well. It was a quality movie.

The photography & sets were beautiful and unique. The action and story were fresh. The relationships between the three characters were well written and the actors were all wonderful in their roles. The nephew's role was scripted just right... and you don't often see that. Most movies have the kid too bratty. But they did a great job with this character of Sean as did the actor (Josh) who played him. His relationship with his uncle and his interactions were well written and acted and quite believable.

The luminescent birds were a nice touch. I got a kick out of the ending with the bird. That was great. It is something I would have done in his place... so that was well received by the audience. The CGI barracudas and sea creatures were superb and very realistic. I liked the interaction they had with those nasty looking fish with the really hideous teeth. I remember seeing some fossils with similar teeth... so they were more realistic than most people might think since there isn't anything quite like that today.

The magnetic rocks were a fun scene and quite unique. Bravo on the effects of the rock rotating. That was very realistic and would have been overlooked by most directors and special effects experts.

But the best CGI scene was the one with the giant Venus flytraps. That was very realistic... and having him wrestle with them was well done.

I will say that the mining cart scene was a little over the top. It was more like a Disneyland roller coaster ride. Thrilling effects which made it appear to be the ultimate roller coaster ride... but just a little beyond credibility when it jumped the chasm and all three separated cars landed perfectly on the tracks... Then a few minutes later did an impossible 3 direction split of 3 cars onto 3 tracks simultaneously which could not occur without rail switching, and even then, only one at a time per switch. However, other than taking a bit too much creative license... it was a thrilling scene with a lot of excitement. Same comments on the falling scene. A bit much on the extended falling like dropping out of the sky without a parachute and remaining in the fall for a ridiculous time period (similar to spy kids 3)... but they handled the end of the fall fairly well at the end.

We especially thank the writer & director... for once, it was refreshing to see a character bring back the fringe benefits with them at the end of the movie. We really get tired of these movies where they find things like that and then lose them in the end. Finally! Someone got smart and actually brought back the goods and benefited from them. Thank you for not leaving the audience frustrated with the characters stupidity like we see in all the other movies.

Very nice ending! The movie was a delight to watch from beginning to end.

You'd have to be a real curmudgeon not to like it. I recommend it for everyone... all ages... except curmudgeons who are never satisfied with anything. Leave them at home or wait until they are gone so they don't ruin the enjoyment of the movie for you.",1268784000,,5211,4.5356762513312034
3399266,4,B0016Q2D5M,"This was just a fun movie-the dialogue was witty, the character interaction was believable and plausible, the special effects were decent (I never saw it in 3-d), the action kept you interested.  I don't think this movie will make it in the history books as a serious contender for a great remake of the Jules Verne novel, but it's a fun family movie to watch and laugh over!",1268352000,,375,4.514705882352941
3399267,4,B0016Q2D5M,"I rented this on blu ray to test my new HDTV, and got a surprisingly enjoyable film.  First off, the scenery shots are absolutely gorgeous, with waterfalls, mountains and oceans and especially the scene where they first end up underground with these flocks of tiny cute glow-in-the-dark ""hummingbirds"" (one of which befriends the boy) flying around in graceful patterns and the ""sky"" is all shades of copper and rose and gold...beautiful.  I kept pausing the film just to appreciate the breathtaking scenery.

The storyline, while simplistic, has relatively few moments where you think ""it doesn't work that way in real life"", since most scenes are given fairly plausible explanations (they're falling a mile or more into the earth and don't die or get seriously injured when they hit bottom because they end up gradually slowing down with the help of a ""waterslide""-type rock formation).  Some of the humor is corny, but Brendan Frasier delivers his lines with such wide-eyed innocence that I kept chuckling in spite of myself.  I also got a kick out the of the end scene in Italy where the teenage boy starts imitating Italian while talking to the guy whose vinyard they accidentally trashed.  This kid spent a lot of the movie complaining, yet demonstrated commendable maturity at the end to deal with this unexpected situation with aplomb.

I also appreciated the geologic information, which I not only found interesting but I hope may entice some young people to join the ranks of the rapidly aging scientists of America these days.  I notice a lot of recent films for children relate to science/science fiction, which is probably deliberate, as they did the same thing in the 1950's, didn't they?

3399288,4,B0016Q2D5M,"2008's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a loose adaption of Jules Verne's classic book set in modern times. Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and ""volcano tube"" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?

One glance at the poster or dvd and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of ""Indiana Jones"", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of ""Journey"" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling rollercoaster-like railcar sequence a la ""Temple of Doom,"" although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of ""Jurassic Park,"" but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).

I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).

Normally I'm not into mindless ""blockbusters"" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's ""The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.

This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels (""Temple of Doom,"" ""Last Crusade"" and ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three ""Pirates of the Carribean"" flicks).

I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.

One last thing: The dvd features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.

3399302,2,B0016Q2D5M,"received this movie from Netflix last night and was in the mood for a good adventure flick, so I decided to give this movie a try. From the opening scene I started to have this bad feeling in my gut as Trevor Anderson(Brendan Fraser) is having a nightmare about his brother Max running from a very silly looking CG Dinosaur and falling to his death. Still I figured it's just a dream sequence I'm sure the movie won't be as bad as the first minute, so I decided to continue with hope. In the first few scenes we see Trevor is not fairing to well at his job as a volcanologist at a school, infact his office is about to be shut down by some wormy looking guy you just want to hit. When Trevor goes home that evening and listens to his answering machine he is reminded that is thirteen year old nephew Sean(Josh Hutcherson) is coming to stay with him for the next ten days. When Sean's mother drops him off she gives Trevor a box with some of Maxes old stuff including a book Journey To The Center of The Earth. When Trevor opens the book later on he finds notes written by his late brother indicating he might have actually found the center of the earth. After going to his lab to look into it Trevor decided to head to Icland to investigate and brings Sean. So they get to Icland and pick up a guide Hannah(Anita Briem) and after a series of events get stuck underground where they end up in a world inside our own world, the center of the Earth.

  So here's my take on this movie. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between. The effects weren't that good in my opinion, maybe if this was a made for TV movie but not up to par for blockbuster movie theater standards in my opinion. Most of the scenes look like they were real people with a moving picture behind them, and any of the creatures in this movie look so fake, almost cartoonlike with there expressions, infact this movie was like watching some kind of looney toons cartoon with live people. They can fall for miles and somehow survive without a scratch. The movie was released in 3-D in the theaters and maybe it looked good in that setting, but on DVD it just looks silly. I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 I say if you have kids under ten it might be worth watching with them, otherwise I'd stay away from this one, there is a 1959 movie of the same name maybe oneday I'll check that one out.",1257033600,,2376,4.206140350877193

3399304,3,B0016Q2D5M,"This (latest, mindless) remake of the Jules Verne classic is hopelessly silly, Brendan Fraser must possess an innate ""annoyance"" chromosome, and if I saw one more death-defying plunge down some endless abyss I was promising to scream louder than the actors.  Yet, oddly, indescribably, uncharacteristically, I found myself having a bit of fun watching this moronic bubble-gum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  I'm just not going to tell anyone.

Playing a pseudo scientist (which is fitting, as Fraser is a pseudo actor) journeying to Iceland with the young son (Josh Hutcherson) of his dearly-departed brother, Fraser's Professor Trevor Anderson comes under the tutelage of Hannah Asgeirsson (Anita Briem), the daughter of Trevor's brother's former mentor (huh?).  Hannah takes the two Americans on an Icelandic expedition, where they end up plunging down a hole and into a funky world of animated nonsense.  All the silliness is amplified by cornpone action sequences, yet I had to keep reminding myself this film was initially a 3D offering for kids (and Hutcherson darn sure plays to that audience), so it's all in good clean (sort of) fun.  The ending is predictably (and conveniently) over the top, and the plot instantly forgettable, but JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is still worth one or two giggles and gaggles.

No plot spoilers from me, but even with a healthy suspension of disbelief, this movie has so many holes and overly cute elements that it falls firmly into the same category as Looney Toon Cartoons for me. Except for one tear jerker scene (relatively short and needed to close a plot line), it is mostly comic mayhem and some bits of genuine excitement. It flows like a video game, moving from scene to scene at a hectic pace that most kids will enjoy.

About the 3D: The DVD we received had the 2D version on one side and the 3D version on the other. It also came with four 3D glasses. The 3D shown in the theaters uses a completely different technology to produce the 3D effect than the type that is possible on home TVs.

First it's important to note that not all versions include the 3D version on the reverse side of the disc. If you're looking for 3D, make sure the version you are buying includes both the 2D and 3D versions. They will both be on a single disc.

Just recently acquiring a Mitsubishi 65"" 3D-ready DLP HDTV I was quite anxious to start viewing all the home variety 3d programming I could get my hands on.

First I found a couple of movies that I knew my kids would love and made the purchase. First was Spy Kids in 3d, followed by Lava Girl and Shark boy. While there were a few spots (very few) with mediocre 3d effects, all in all I was pretty disappointed with the lack of depth perception, clarity, color, and items that were supposed to 'pop' out at you. On a scale from 1 to 10 for 3d goodness, I'd give each a 3.

Not wanting to give up on home 3d viewing, I searched for another kid friendly 3d movie for home viewing, and wound up ordering Journey to the Center of the Earth.

Now, I haven't watched this with my kids yet, that will be this weekend. But I just completed my pre-viewing - in 3d - and all I can say is WOW!
Unlike the other two movies mentioned above, both of which had you putting on your 3d glasses, then taking them off, then putting them on again, the entire movie here is in 3d. And the 3d effects are good. I mean really good.

Finally I was able to see stuff pop out of the screen at me. And the entire move - all scenes - look as though you are viewing them through a viewmaster. Total depth of scene, along with decent color and clarity. I am so happy to finally have something that will make my 3d hdtv come to life. And that I know my kids are going to love as well!
My advice. If you're looking for a good 3d movie to watch at home, don't miss this one.

The only drawback I've found is that this movie uses their own unique 3d galsses, instead of the common red/green variety. Too bad since I own several pair of expensive plastic framed standard anaglyph red/green glasses. So, when watching this movie, we are forced to use the cheap paper glasses that come with it, as no others will work (I've tried).

Still, I highly recommend the movie for it's superb at home 3d effects, and fun, action filled story.",1242691200,,2341,4.1866666666666665

The writers aimed this movie at 5 and 6 year old kids, but I think even they would be bored to tears as the action doesn't start until two thirds of the film has elapsed! Even when the film gets going.....so to speak, it's so tame and ridiculous that you would be much better off watching a classic like 'Pinocchio' or even the Saturday morning TV show 'Land Of The Lost' for more drama!

I like Brendan Frasier, but he has made some extremely bad film choices over the years, hey I know....who can argue with a couple of million dollars to do this stuff?. Right?....... I'd probably do it too!

In short, the CGI is unconvincing, the film is beyond juvenile and the story is really stupid and boring, it even seemed long for it's 85 minute running time and 10 minutes of that are opening and closing credits.

Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't, as it is totally unbelievable even for a Verne's novel.
Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary. The revelation is in relation to the lovely Anita Briem who steals the show and proves beyond any doubt that she has the potential to have a great career in acting.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all right, though there was plenty of room for improvement.

3399357,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Fraser, Anita Briem and Josh Hutcherson go deep in the relatively entertaining tale ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth.""  This version of ""Journey"" is not a remake nor is it an adaptation of the Jules Verne adventure that some many other films have been based on.

In this particular tale, Fraser plays a seismic geologist named Trevor Anderson who is losing students and his brother's memorial research center at the university where he teaches and does research.  When his nephew, Sean (Hutcherson), comes up to spend a few days with him before moving with his mother to Canada, the pair uncover notes in Sean's father's copy of ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth"" that match up with some of Trevor's research.  This leads them to believe that Sean's dad might have been on to something before he went missing in the field.

With Sean's father's copy of ""Journey"" in tow, a hasty trip to Iceland is planned to check data gathered at one of Trevor's sites.  Notes in the novel lead the pair to an obscure professor's research institute in Iceland where they meet the now-deceased scientist's daughter, Hannah (Briem).  She agrees to guide them on their quest and then the three of them literally journey to the center of the Earth.

Once the group enters the cave that will eventually lead to the center of the Earth, the viewer is offered a ton of visual oohh's and ahhh's.

Originally shot in 3-D, the film relies on the gimmick a bit too much at times and the plot suffers for it.  The CGI is very vibrant and colorful, and can be sketchy at certain points.  However, the entire film has a light air to it, and the sometimes goofy CGI only aids to this.  From runaway mining cars a la ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" to a race for life against an enormous T-Rex that nods to ""Jurassic Park,"" the writers/director/producers know exactly what they've got with this film and try to build upon it throughout the movie.

Fraser, Hutcherson and Briem work very well together.  While there's quite a bit of generic dialogue between the characters, they seem to be in on the joke that this film is meant strictly to entertain and do nothing else.  All three of them seemed to be having fun with the silliness of the script.

While it isn't the greatest family film out there, it is definitely a crowd pleaser for families with children under the age of thirteen.  Some of the action might be a little tough for younger viewers to watch, but the film has no foul language (although adults and most kids will pick up the ""shist"" line easily), no sexuality and only brief moments of peril.

Take it for what it is.  It's funny, silly and plays to Fraser's comedic strengths.  He's one of the few actors who can pull off the action/comedy bit and do it well.  It's more deserving of three-and-a-half stars than four, but I rounded up for the simple fact that it is a very fun film to watch.

Recommended to families with children interested in science fiction and fantasy, fans of Fraser's work, and to folks who just want to turn of their brains for a bit and have a good laugh.",1241136000,,3090,4.53971119133574

The 1959 version with it's comically outdated ""special"" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the ""gravitas"" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie?

This rendition might just be my favorite.  Brendan Frasier does his signature comedic role in this movie where he and a couple of people wind up making their way to the Center of the Earth in the very traditional Jules Verne story.

Don't expect an adult story, expect Verne's story.  Expect a pinch of comedy.  Expect Dinosaurs.  Expect neat special effects.  Expect to hang your brain at the door.

This is a light airy movie that delivers marvelously provided you don't go into it expecting some kind of heavy drama, or high adventure.  If you're here for a lighter version of Journey to the Center of the Earth - this is it.

Of note, there are really only 3 characters to this movie with minor characters coming in at the very beginning and then the very end.  So you'll wind up seeing a lot of Brendan Frasier and his couple of young cohorts.

The 3-D version makes this great flick better!  Everything across the screen literally jumps out at you.  You will want to retrieve you favorite 3-D specs and watch it in a dark room.

Fraser, Hutcherson, and Briem give stellar performances with the Weiss, Flackett, and Levin screenplay that follows Jules Vern's original novel.  As the characters progress deep down into the earth we learn applied science while being entertained by science fiction.  We see diamonds galore in volcano tubes, luminescent birds, hungry sea monsters, floating rocks, and even a crazed T-Rex.  3-D adds to this excitement.  (One hopes that these moviemakers will indeed make a sequel- hinted about Atlantis- in the final scene).

Trevor's brother and Sean's father Max disappeared a decade before looking for the center of the Earth.  Max left behind sensors that detect geological shifts in the Earth's crust and a cryptic series of notes in a Jules Verne novel (guess which one?). When one of the sensors fails in Iceland, Trevor decides to go on an adventure in 1950s fashion, bringing along his plucky nephew for the ride.

Accompanying Trevor and Sean is the fetching Hannah sgeirsson (Antia Briem), the daughter of another volcanologist and the only person with any spelunking skill whatsoever.  While checking on the device, lightning strikes, our heroes dive for cover, and from there it's a lot of falling, screaming, and running.

This is a 3-D movie, which means that at various times and for no reason whatsoever, something flies straight at the screen.  Since you will likely not have invested in the expensive 3-D glasses and you may not have even had the good sense to rent the 3-D version, this makes the movie seem even dumber than it is.

The other surprise is that despite the dinosaurs and the hottie, this movie is aimed at a younger set.  The dialogue isn't very good, although Fraser does his best.  Sean is meant to be a wisecracking preteen modern hero, but he reverts quickly to type.  Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.

Did I mention the irritating glow-in-the-dark mascot?  There's a bird.  It follows Sean around.  Only he can understand it.  And it glows in the dark.

Wrong.
The relation to the original story is weak, with only the `idea' preserved, none of the richness of character, imagination and depth of detail of the book (or the original James Mason film, for that matter..).
The script is geared to kids, and is all about moving quickly through the motions in the same way those short movies that introduce amusement park attractions do.  No-one cares about character development or building tension etc... it's just - when can we get to our next `moment'!  And if it's moments you are after, there are certainly some ok effects on display, and younger viewers might have their interest held.. but I for one was grateful it only lasted 90 minutes.
So much for the film - what about the 3D!  Well, there is the option to watch in 3D on one disc, or 2D on the other.  In 2D the movie is flat, lighting looks abnormally bright, and colours washed out.  On the 3D version - yes, you really do get to watch in 3D - or at least as many of you have glasses...  However, the effect though stunning is rather erratic, the glasses uncomfortable cheap cardboard, the images in dark and weird colours thanks to the green / red glasses you wear.  I think watching in 3D is an exciting novelty - but based on this, it's a cinema experience, not a home theatre one, no matter if you do have a large projector screen. And clearly directors have not yet figured out how to make a movie that happens to be 3D, rather than an amusement park ride drawn out to feature length in order to get a release.  It's all just too self conscious.
Shame, I love Jules Verne, and even beneath the shallowness of this effort I enjoyed some of it in the way younger kids will.  But my advice - save the pennies, and next time a movie like this comes along, try and see it at the cinema if you want to see it in 3D.",1232668800,,1906,4.373937677053824

The situations went from crazy mine shaft rides that rival Warner Brothers cartoons, to the director failing to catch someone's chest strap on their backpack unhitched in a rough climb. . . . But who is looking for stuff like that?

Its silly incredible (and I do mean that literally) chase scenes lent to the comedy for me because it truly was closer to a cartoon than a movie.  Temperatures rising to 115 and not a bead of sweat on anyone's skin?  Come on!  Even a light coating of vaseline would have done the trick, they didn't even have the budget for that?

I guess if it was 3-D then it didn't matter.  But it certainly left me unfulfilled.  I wouldn't recommend it, unless I wanted to dumb down someone's kid.  Read the book instead.",1232236800,,874,4.440251572327044

The so-called dramatic scenes are laughable. The plot of the movie is a unique twist on the original novel by Verne, but misses the mark entirely by hiding a classic story behind bad acting and special effects. Hollywood ought to realize that moviegoers are more intelligent nowadays. We know that this sort of scenario is virtually impossible, but at least try to explain a more intelligent answer to how it could be done. (We know that a free fall thousand of feet down does not lead to a nice gentle landing on a waterslide much less an ability to have a nice calm conversation on the way down!)

I saw this with my 11 year old granddaughter. There were a couple of moments it seemed to drag, but overall it was incredibly engaging. It was cute, a little scary at times, and kept you on your toes. When it was over we both looked at each other and said ""already?!"". This was the absolute best family movie I have seen in years and years and everyone except very small children should see it.

Be aware that it is incredibly unbelievable, but remember it's not trying to be. It's FUN! There will be some dialogue that's so silly it's funny. The characters are very watchable and likeable and you care what happens to them.

So - put the youngest ones (under 4) to bed, because the sea sequence will scare them out of their gourd. Grab everyone else, load up on snacks, and settle in!",1231804800,8,1004,4.445652173913044

And apparently it wasn't just me because my friend felt the same way. As for the movie. Boring!!! Predictable. It lacked energy and there was no where near enough action for an ""adventure"" movie. There would be a short sequence of potential excitement, and then... nothing. The acting: Ho Hum!! Usually I can at least finish a movie, especially if I paid for it. But not this.

The emotional issues men and boys face in life are handled succinctly, giving this movie more depth than the non-stop action would seem to allow. The 3D effects truly add to the excitement. The few gratuitous/gross ones were just plain old fun & funny. The theater was packed and people actually clapped at the end.

3399438,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Granted this is an adventure/action film.  And granted that it was kept fairly clean for family viewing.  Still, I had some problems with the movie.  Without going into detail, it sort of mimics the original Jules Verne story.  However, it is interesting in that it references the original story as some sort of secret code of a quasi-secret society and implies that it wasn't at all fictional when Verne wrote it.

Here's where it goes wrong.  The characters are shallow.  The plot is really unoriginal.  The special effects are so obviously specially generated effects that they aren't particularly special at all.  Even the sentimentalism is very thin.

There were many improbable scenes that require such a stretch of suspension of disbelief to make it work, that it didn't.  Another movie I think of, in a similar genre, had no issue with suspension of disbelief.  No, in fact, Raiders of the Lost Ark made you believe it was all quite possible.  Easily so.  Journey to the Center of the Earth did not.

As a side note: we switched from the 3D to the 2D after about 15 minutes into it.  It just wasn't that visually appealing as a 3D movie.

Although I think some of the ""close calls"" were quite unrealistic and would probably never happen in real life if someone actually fell to the center of the earth. Anyway here are a few of the close calls that I remember from the movie. I took notes on all of the close calls because they were so cool and had me at the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie.

1) Trevor almost steps into a 200 ft deep cliff but Hannah the mountain guide pushes him out of the way at the last minute.

2) When all 3 of them were climbing down the rope wasn't long enough so Hannah cuts the rope and lets Trevor go or else the 3 of them will plunge down. He was actually already at the bottom and Hannah played a trick on him!

3) MY FAVORITE: Going over the broken tracks in the mine and where Hannah has to jump onto Trevor's car.

4) MOST UNREALISTIC- An actual smooth landing into the center of the earth after a 10 minute plunge when the muscovite breaks through (they end up swimming for a long time which is quite unrealistic since they don't have oxygen tanks).

5) Where both Trevor and Sean are chased by a big dinosaur, and the dinosaur falls through the muscovite. Trevor almost plunges down, but he catches the top of the cliffhanger. He is VERY LUCKY like he said in the movie.

6) Exiting the center of the enter (VERY COOL)!

These are the 6 out of the total of 11 close calls that really stuck out to me in the movie.",1230422400,,1518,4.108108108108108
3399441,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I saw this film in 3D in San Francisco.  It was outstanding.  There was excellent technical direction, as well as an interesting story.  The film has the usual stereoscopic gags with things popping into your eyes which I object to.  With 3D coming into increased use, perhaps Directors will get a clue it plays to the VFX, not the story.  As a slight digression, the best stereoscopic movie out there is ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" - this is a conversion of a formerly 2D movie; the 3D conversion enhanced the film.

Anaglyph video, as well as anaglyph comics, have been around at least since the 1950's.  Whoever did this conversion to a nonstandard choice of green/magenta versus the usual red/cyan does not make sense to me, considering the body of technical knowledge, skill available for such a conversion using red/cyan.  Perhaps it is an attempt to deploy rights management, but the glasses are available separately.  I observed many alignment problems with JTTCOTE.  Some shots with vertical misalignment in the original were not fixed in post.  There is a particular scene in the guide's house sitting around a coffee table: it was as if the two cameras had slightly different magnification.

The 2D conversion of the movie was well done, but not excellent.  I have viewed several BD videos by now, and I expect a certain amount of care in the conversion.

It is my opinion that the technical deployment of the stereoscopic portion of this BLU-RAY release of JTTCOTE was a hack job, poorly thought out, poorly done.  Considering how well the stereoscopic version in the theatrical release was so well done (albeit some minor alignment problems), that it should be so poorly deployed on the DVD release.  I saw the discussion of this film at NAB in Las Vegas 2008.  The Director and his colleagues put such effort and care in the technical deployment of this film, only to have it so poorly rendered in this DVD release has done the work a considerable disservice.  If you are purchasing this release with the goal of viewing this in stereoscopic 3D in your home, it is my strong opinion that you will be very disappointed.",1230336000,2,2136,4.8054794520547945

The adaptation of 3-D for blu-ray has a few issues though.  It uses an unusual combination of red and green lenses, and the green will often get too dark and you'll find yourself adjusting the glasses to try and get a better view.  I'm not sure if the glasses are what cause the movie to become so devoid of color, but it almost appears to be a black and white film in 3-D.  Though entertaining, some of the 3-D tricks are the oldest in the book, and you almost feel like you've been there - done that.  You WILL appreciate the ability to choose between the 3-D and the standard versions of the film.

Obviously the comparison between this version of Journey to the Center of the Earth and it's original counterpart is going to be like comparing apples and oranges. The technology has progressed so much for this latest version.  You won't need to use your imagination so much now.

What this movie did was made the story into more of fascinating joy ride.  It gave you thrill ride sensation, like you were at an amuzement park or at a theme park.  The movie had some fun scenes that must have been great in 3D.  I liked the roller coaster ride that was created from the mine shaft train, a little Indiana Jonesish, but still fun.  The dino scene was a little silly, but still fun.  The falling scenes were also pretty good.  Although the humor was campy, there were definately a few laughs.

Fraser is a rather nice guy geologist who is down on his luck, his brother went missing over ten years ago and Fraser is attempting to keep his work going.  His nephew is sent to spend a short vacation with him and Fraser is given his brothers things that eventually open the door to going on the journey.  Cool were the older copies of Jules Vernes actual book.  I remembered some of those from grammar school.

There is the usual troubled teen issue at the beginning and he grows from his bonding experience with his uncle.  So we have a good story, good comedy, great action and effects, but, it was still a bit light.  I wish they would have had Pat Boone show up in the flick for a cameo giving us a connection with the old movie.

Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.

The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.

With that said, I liked the movie.  It was mindless fun that kept me entertained.  I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser (sp?), but he does a decent enough job here - he is at his usual slap-stick comedy routine, but that helps lighten the mood of the movie.  Even the kid actor did a good job (I remember him from Bridge to Terebitia (sp?), so I was hoping he would do just as well in this movie).

As to the BD itself - the movie has a pretty clean transfer, which helps make the 3D version of the movie look even better.

The movie is an excuse for a 3D film (they used the RealD polarized system (passive glasses) in theaters which was dark but good), and would be all right IF the 3D was even remotely as watchable here, (It's not). To combat pirating they used a magenta-green system instead of the red-blue standard, and it's even worse than bad. Now that there are Mitsubishi and Samsung HDTVs that are 3D ready out there the studios need to get with the program and produce either field sequential or polarized versions,(watchable on affordable 22"" iz3D monitors). Anaglyph just doesn't cut the mustard anymore. People who will pay for blu-ray will shell out for the hardware to get a decent 3D experience at home!

The concept of 3D is used best used to draw the viewer into the action.  This was done well in the movie ""Spy Kids 3D"".  There is always the use of ""coming at you"" in the 3D which should be used with discretion.  Journey over-uses this concept in a very predictable manner.

3399572,4,B0016Q2D5M,"3D on TV isn't going to be anything like high tech IMAX, but it isn't all that bad with proper colored lenses. I have a sample pack of ""Lee Filter"" colored ""gel"" lenses 1.5""x3.5"" that I got at a company that sells colored gel lenses for theater and band spot lights. What I did was start the movie and pause it at a place that showed 3D artifacts. The halo colors I saw were green and pink. They might be different on your TV depending on how your color is adjusted and that is the main point here. I don't think one pair of colored glasses is going to work well on all TVs. In this case, I started with light colored pinks and greens and kept trying darker samples of each color until I could no longer the see pink halo through the green lens or green halo through the pink lens. At this point all one should be able to see is a single object in the picture without any halo. I held the sample pack up to my eyes with the pink sample out to the left and the green sample out to the right. By changing the angle of the lenses between vertical to 45 degrees (darkens and lightens the image slightly) and rotating the lenses so one lense is closer to one eye than the other, I could fine tune the image. After I found the sweet spot, I sat back and really enjoyed the movie. Some of the 3D images actually left the TV but mostly it was like looking through a window at another 3D world. Until 3D format become uniform industry wide, I think this will work the best whether for red and blue or red and green and all shades in between. A person could remove the lenses from the sample pack and make their own glasses, but the next movie might not work with those exact colors.

BTW, the colors that worked for me were ""Primary Green and Bright Pink"", but again, it may be all in how the color scheme was set up on my TV.
Also, I have a 62"" Toshiba Rear Projection DLP TV and I sat real close.

3399577,3,B0016Q2D5M,"It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be ""too many."" I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/horrible-television-adaptation-in-January/dp/B0016MJ6HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">horrible television adaptation in January</a>&nbsp;starring Rick Schroeder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B0017I3RKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000EWBKLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mummy-series/dp/B001HQZJPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mummy series'</a>&nbsp;of films.

The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.

Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.

Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1959-version-starring-James-Mason/dp/B00007JMD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1959 version starring James Mason</a>&nbsp;as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the `59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...

It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines (""What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs."" -- when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-novel/dp/1562549146/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the novel</a>.

It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zathura/dp/B000DBHX4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zathura</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/B000P6R5Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RV/dp/B000GCFNZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RV</a>, and the soon-to-be-released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cirque-Du-Freak/dp/0316153788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cirque Du Freak</a>.

I am sorry to say that, despite the low price, it is a huge disappointment: the 3D version of the film is essentially monochromatic and the 3D illusion is dismal, as there is a double image (ghost). The result is much worse than even an experimental 3D-TV series of broadcasts some years ago...

I fully agree with the reviewer who proposed that a higher-priced but better-realised package would have been much preferable; maybe even a CRT-screen implementation for those (like me) who still prefer a good CRT over a run-of-the-mill LCD screen.

Do not buy this item. Maybe that will give the producers the message that they must do a better job next time.",1227052800,3,772,4.753731343283582

With a running time of barely 90 minutes, there's no filler at all, but frankly, there's no depth. Fraser, with his affable charm, at least gives the film a center. His nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and their Icelandic volcano guide (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) are given little else to do except run from danger and scream often.

Given that ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" was set up as a kids effects movie (I did not see the 3-D version, but the 3-D moments were obvious), this is pure, mildly exciting and non-frightening entertainment.

I've read many of these books, and have watched almost all the English-language movie adaptations of said books, and I will say that this is the best adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth produced by Hollywood so far.  This version is not as faithful to the book's plot as previous versions.  But as a movie, it is by far the best, for the following reasons.  First of, the special effects are great and very realistic, which is a required of any sci-fi movie these days.  Second, the action and dialogue were actually quite believable.  Brendan Fraser actually played a half-serious role, and the movie, though funny, was not ridiculous.  The other two characters; the boy and the lady, came across well, and were cast well.  Last, there were no outlandish scenes involving far-fetched technology, or some long-lost underground tribe of humans.  This made the movie very believable.

The glasses have magenta and blue lenses, unlike the typical red/blue lenses of most home 3D movies, the ghosting (double images) is minimal. Certainly the 3D looks far better than on Sony's ""Polar Express."" You need the glasses (four pair) that come will the movie for maximum effect.

The story is pretty basic, but has a lot of action.  If you watch the regluar non 3D version I would give it a 3 out of 5, not great, but not bad either.  HOWEVER, The 3D is what makes this movie extra fun and it was specifically designed to be a 3D movie as is evident by the cinematography.  This movie is a great one to show off your blu-ray player to guests or when your kids have a sleep over.

Yes, the colors are obviously going to be distorted AFTER you put the glasses on, but its still in 3D.  It takes about 5 minutes for your eyes to adjust to looking through the glasses.  Then your eyes will start to color correct some of the distortion.  Also, the start up screen tells you to brighten your flat screen as the glasses make the picture appear darker.  I'll still take this version over the regular version any day, even IF the colors are distorted by the glasses.

You get 4 pairs of glasses with the movie.  If you plan to show this to more than 4 people at a time in the future, do what I did and buy an extra few pairs on Amazon.com while they are still available.

In fact it is in my top five all time favorites so you can imagine from the ads I suspected this remake would be a real loser. Especially when I heard it was 3D. In all seriousness do you ever truly take the 3D movies serious? We did not watch it in 3D but I imagine we will at some point. After watching it with my wife we decided two things. We still like the original best, the second was this isn't a true remake. However, I mean that in the best terms. We actually found this version quite entertaining and not at all like the original and that we liked too. It doesn't try to be or beat the classic movie. Although you see some jewels, giant mushrooms, a dinosaur, et cetera, none of it feels or looks the same.

Brendan Frasier (The Mummy), Josh Hutcherson (Jurassic Park III), and Anita Briem do a great job of acting in this movie and that really helps too. Look for a couple cute references in this movie to Josh's part in JP III. Good quality DVD with good replayability. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could but I don't feel bad about four. There aren't enough movies like this to suit me these days. As a kid I was spoiled by having lots of movies like this to watch. I kind of feel sorry for kids and families today because if they don't appreciate the classic versions, it's a wasteland out there for the most part. I recommend it for the whole family.

3399615,2,B0016Q2D5M,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is directed by an Oscar winning visual effects artist, and it shows. The movie looks amazing. And that's about it. The writing is plodding, predictible and as stale as the air in an underground cave.

The actors do their best to bring charm and freshness to the film, but its like performing CPR on a day-old corpse. The characters say and do things that a baboon with two brain cells to rub together wouldn't do, just to further the abysmal screenwriting and set the movie up for director Eric Brevig's strong point; the visual effects.

And Brevig does a good job with the visuals, the underground terrarium is a sci-fi wonderland, although the dinosaurs look a little lame. But if there's one thing that's been proved over and over, its that gorgeous CGI makes a good video game, but not a good movie.

I couldn't help comparing this to Brendan Fraser's 10-year-old action adventure, The Mummy. The CGI in The Mummy was cutting edge for its time, and its still looks fine. But the writing is witty, the characters are engaging, the whole thing is livelier and more memorable because someone put some effort into the storytelling.

I love Branden Fraser - loved him in The Mummy! Here is portrays a rather wimpy college professor trying to prove a theory about the fact that Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth novel is not just fiction - but it actually there is such a place.

His nephew is played by Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabihia) - typical 13 year old that hates the fact that he has to spend 2 weeks out of his summer vacation with his uncle.  When an anomaly in his computer lab detects another active volcano that might lead to Earth's core - he takes his nephew to Iceland to meet with another professor that had the same belief in Verne's theories.

When they arrive in Iceland they are greeted by the professor's daughter (Anita Briem) who is a mountain guide but staunchly doesn't believe in her father's writings.  She then agrees to take them up the mountain for an exorbitant fee.

I felt that much of the movie were clips from other films...  i.e. Scenes from Jurassic Park with extinct creatures, complete with the T-Rex; the roller coaster mine scene from Indiana Jones - Temple of Doom.  The acting was rather stilted and the scenes trite at times. The action adventure pace was good though as well as the special effects.

By  Zendoch ""Zendoch"" (USA) - See all my reviews

I just finished watching this film on a 42"" lcd flat screen tv with a blu ray system in place. I bought it after hearing how good it was in 3D and figured that the technology would be the same. Wrong-O!
The first thing I noticed when I took the glasses out that they were the old colored 3D glasses and those never gave true 3D. As I watched the movie I found that some of the effects where hit or miss. Sometimes the 3D would seem to pop out a bit but most of the time the movie was like watching the old view master toys but the picture was moving. Also, like noted by some of the other reviews, the glasses distorted the picture. My wife wears contact lenses (gas premables or something like that.)and she commented that the picture seemed to jump into black or white for her. The manufactuers only suggestion is to watch the movie on a bright setting.
Overall the movie is some what enjoyable but the reviews about how great the 3D is in theaters should not be here. It is misleading. The technology in the movie theaters was polarized I've found out which gives the movie a far superior look. If you've ever experienced Disney at one of their theme parks you know what I mean.
I would avoid buying this movie until they remaster it to work with polarized 3D or some other technology that will give you a theater like experience the movie itself is not good enough to blow the money on unless you are a HUGE Brendan Fraser fan.

I'll add that to pay what one pays for blu-ray disc you should expect more from advanced technology than an upgrade in the color of your glasses. HD and blu-ray create beautiful pictures so unless you want a 3D experience that cheapens your set up I would, rent, skip or borrow a buddy's until they remaster this.",1226102400,2,1855,4.340057636887608

3399621,5,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Frasier stars in this loose adaptation of the classic Jules Verne novel by the same name.  Frasier stars as Trevor Anderson, a college professor who teaches plate tectonics and volcanism.  He is kidded by his colleagues because he only has two students in his class.  Ten years earlier, Trevor's brother went off to prove that the assumptions made by Verne in his novel were actually true.  Trevor has also agreed to take in his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for the summer.  Trevor share his beliefs about the center of the earth with Sean.  Soon, the two are off to Iceland to track down a possible entry to the center of the earth.

Once in Iceland, Sean and Trevor meet Hannah (Anita Briem).  Hannah is the daughter of a dead Icelandic professor whom Trevor's brother was working with.  It is possible that the two may have indeed found the entryway described by Verne.  Hannah agrees to be Trevor's guide and take him to the possible entry site.  Once there, Trevor discovers a piece of scientific apparatus and retrieves it, but a severe lightning storm strikes, forcing Trevor to drop the apparatus and run to the safety of a nearby cave.  Unfortunately, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean are trapped when a large rockslide covers the entrance, but they did indeed find the entrance to the center of the earth, for soon, they are careening down an abandoned mineshaft in coal cars.  Then, they fall through a thin layer of rock and, just as in Verne's novel, find themselves at the center of the earth.

But, once there, Hannah makes a sobering discovery; she find's Trevor's deceased brother.  After burying him, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean must find a way back to the surface before the underground temperature gets too hot.  Along the way, they encounter some nasty sea creatures, a very scary T-Rex, and some hungry carnivorous plants.  Their only hope is to reach a vent which leads to the surface, but this vent is located on the far side of a vast underwater ocean.  Will the three adventurers make it before its too late?

This is an excellent movie.  Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role, and Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are very good as well.  The special effects are first-rate, and there are several exciting moments in the movie, including the T-Rex chase, the journey across the underground ocean, and the thrilling ride in the mine cars.

I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  It does a good job of combining adventure and comedy.  Viewers familiar with Jules Verne's story will surely enjoy this fine movie.",1226102400,,2548,4.778032036613272

In this cinematic world, scientific fact is the equivalent of a prize greased pig - everyone keeps chasing it, but no one ever catches it.  If you're going to throw realism to the curb, though, you might as well do it in unabashed grand style - and that is precisely what you get in this 21st century Journey to the Center of the Earth.  What you have here is your basic summer-time action comedy.  These guys survive falls that Wile E. Coyote couldn't walk away from.  Fortunately, the whole thing is entertaining enough to overcome all of the inanities that could otherwise have doomed this film into forgettable silliness.  In other words, it's a Brendan Fraser movie.  Every time I see Brendan Fraser in a movie, my immediate reaction is to say uh oh and expect the worst - yet every time I actually end up feeling entertained.  That's not to say this is a good movie - it's more of what I call a ""good enough"" movie.

Fraser plays Trevor Anderson, a volcanologist dedicated to continuing his late older brother's studies.  Max apparently got himself killed searching for the lost world described in Verne's novel, believing that the father of science fiction was describing fact and not fantasy.  Just when his lab is stolen out from under him and all seems to be lost, a 10-day visit with Max's son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) brings with it new clues in the form of notes inside Max's copy of Verne's novel - and this leads uncle and nephew to discover a new site in Iceland they simply have to explore.  The scientist they want to check with in Iceland turns out to be dead, but his hot redheaded daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) agrees to guide the two up the mountain to the site.  Of course, they end up trapped by a cave-in and forced to explore the mountain cave system in search of an exit.  They find a lot more than that, though.

The film's myriad of CGI effects aren't all that impressive in 2D, but I'm sure the 3-D version must pack much more of a punch.  Either way, though, I was surprised at how few ""prehistoric"" creatures there were on display.  For example, I expected to see people running from dinosaurs all over the place, but there's basically just one giant monster to be found here.  The characters' falls are worth watching, though, especially the first big one.  If there's a longer falling scene in any other movie, I haven't come across it yet.  A roller coaster-like ride in an old mine system is also great fun to watch - and the adventure doesn't end there.

3399660,3,B0016Q2D5M,"About once every decade or so the motion picture industry decides to revisit 3-D technology, and one of the properties chosen for this occasion was Jules Verne's classic JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Originally published in 1864, the story has been through more screen and television adaptations than you can shake a stick at--most famously in a 1959 big screen adaptation starring James Mason.  The current version, however, is not a literal adaptation of the novel; it is instead a modern riff that finds scientest Trevor Anderson (Brandon Fraser) using his late brother's notes on the Jules Verne novel in an effort to revive interest in his own dying university program.

With smart-alec nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and hiking guide Hannah (Anita Briem) in tow, Trevor stumbles into a cave that leads to an old mine that unexpectedly drops them to the center of the earth, where they find Verne was right all along.  Along the way they encounter a wild mine cart ride, a man-eating plant, a T-Rex, and lots of other bits of business designed to show off the 3-D effects.

3-D is really a big screen format, and when to bring it to the small screen the result is only so-so.  The glasses are as annoying as ever, especially if you wear glasses yourself; be that as it may, it works fairly well as long you keep the room completely dark and sit directly in front of the television.  You may have to move further back or closer to the screen for best viewing.  This aside, JOURNEY is a flyweight thing, well-designed, reasonably well-acted, but with a trivial script and story that exist only to provide an excuse for the 3-D effects.  Recommended if you want check out what 3-D is like these days, but never mind the rest.

3399661,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I love Brendan Fraser. I would see him in any film, even in one as awful as this. So if was difficult to only give this film a single star. But even the affable Fraser cannot save this bad film. This is a film that only a six year old can enjoy. Perhaps I should have had one to sit and watch with me. This film needed a little more attention to detail. A better script and less reliance on 3D visual effects. Perhaps then it would have  been an enjoyable, if mindless, entertainment.  My thoughts while watching my 2D DVD version was that the film must have been originally developed as an animated feature film. It has that ridiculousness in both plot and acting that seem more appropriate in a Saturday morning cartoon. For example, take the falling down the hole sequence. The main characters scream cartoon voices  and converse in whole sentences while flaying their arms as they fall endlessly downward. Sort of like 'Alice in Wonderland'. Another example is the sequence win which the younger hero (the oldest looking 13 years old I've seen on screen for a long time), traverses a chasm by hoping and sliding on magnetized boulders. The laws of physics be damned!
Worse yet, the DVD's 3D version uses the aged green/red 3D cardboard glasses technology that makes the film almost un-viewable.  If you somehow manage to sit through the complete film using these glasses, be prepared for a headache and sore eyeballs. I assume that the theatrical version used the superior polarized glasses similar to the ones used in Beowulf 3D.",1225756800,3,1534,4.691449814126394
3399662,4,B0016Q2D5M,"No this movie's story line will not go into the writers' hall of fame.  I probably wouldn't have spent time watching it if it wasn't in 3-D.  But the 3-D is a LOT of fun.  I made believers out of my wife and mother-in-law who were very skeptical and initially refused to wear the silly pink and green 3D glasses included with the DVD.  But it is alot of fun to watch the depth of this movie.  In contrast to what some reviewers believe, 3D doesn't mean stuff is constantly jumping out at you.  It gives the movie depth.  When you look down the hole and it looks like it is disappearing back behind your wall, that is depth. The movie is filled with layers of depth which make it much richer than a flat 2D image.  Yes, the pink and green glasses mess with the color, but you get sort of adjusted after a while.  I didn't notice a huge breakdown in sharpness as other reviewers remarked.  Sure, it would be great to be just like the movie theater, on the 4k dual DLP projectors, but the theaters spend hundreds of thousands of $$ to get that set up.  If you have the dough, go for it.  If you are a regular joe with a big box retailer TV, this is the best they can get you, for now.  There are several technologies in the works, but they will go no where until public interest is peaked.  Go ahead and buy this DVD, it is a lot of fun to watch.",1225756800,,1343,4.076335877862595
3399663,4,B0016Q2D5M,"From the folks who brought as the Chronicles of Narnia films, Walden Media, comes ""Journey To the Center of The Earth"", starring lovable goof-slash-action hero, Brendan Fraser.  (I watched the 2D version, by the way.)

While this film doesn't have the deep spiritual overtones of 'Narnia', it does enforce positive family values and encourages bonds of relationships between friends and relatives.  If you're looking for a good adventure movie to watch with all ages without being worried it's going to be really gory or filled with unexpected sexual innuendo and laced with profanity, I recommend this movie.

The visual effects and CGI are top notch, and you really feel like there is depth to the cliffs, rockfaces and caverns.  The creatures in the movie are very well done, and include a drooling T-Rex, luminiscent birds and giant pirahna.  Because 'Journey' was probably done digitally for the most part, they really enhanced the color palette, and the colors are rich and saturated.

The acting is what you'd expect from a Disney-type adventure movie...no academy award performances here, but the actors give their best for what kind of movie this is...a fun, entertaining popcorn flick.

Just one gripe...Brendan Fraser didn't look like he worked out too much to get in shape for this movie and had man-boobs.  On the other hand, the cute actress Anita Biem from Iceland,who plays the lead female role, is a breath of fresh air and I think we'll be seeing more from her in the future.",1225756800,,1493,4.963855421686747
3399664,5,B0016Q2D5M,Was expecting not so great performance after reading other reviews and experiencing other 3D DVD movies. But this blu-ray version of this movie is simply superb. I am not sure if it is because it was Blu-ray because my earlier experiences were with the Shrek DVD in 3D. Wish there was an easier way to get hold of more 3D glasses as the Movie came with 4 pairs. Will be an interesting movie to watch for the kids when you have a movie night for your kids and their friends over at your home.,1225670400,4,491,4.23404255319149
3399695,5,B0016Q2D5M,"Before I write a short review on this movie please carefully listen to what I am about to say here.

DON'T ever pre-order from Amazon.  I pre-ordered this movie and paid over $26.  Only after a few days, the price went down $3.00 lower.  If you are not in hurry, just wait to get the best price.

-  Picture quality of the 2D version is not as good as other HD/Blu Ray movies I have seen.
-  Same RED/BLUE glasses like Spy Kid 3D or Shark Boy and Lava Girl.  You don't take glasses off during the movie.  Instead you put it on for the whole time.  If your eyes are getting tired, pause the movie for a moment, go to the restroom and come back.
-  I think the 3D here is better than the Spy Kid 3 & Shark Boy & Lava Girl.  It could be due to the movie is made on BluRay.
-  The story is simple.  After 10 minutes, the movie will take you to the journey.

A high definition 3D movie --- Great.------Boy was I wrong. What a waste of money. It is the old style 3D and it looked terrible. Washed out yellow and green --almost like the tint was set wrong.

3399697,5,B0016Q2D5M,"I cant talk about the 3d version since I haven't seen it yet, but the movie itself was great family fun.  My wife and 10 year old son watched this last weekend and it was a really cool movie.  It had some very nice visuals and a few ""jump out of your seat"" scares.  My entire family loved it.  Its also one of the nicest video transfers I've seen on blu ray.",1225670400,3,358,3.9305555555555554
3399698,4,B0016Q2D5M,"My 10-year-old son was mesmerized from the time the movie began until it ended. I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" fit the bill.

Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects.

""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.",1225670400,,1634,4.916666666666667

Anyway the 3d effects with the glasses were pretty descent on my 42 inch tv.
So bottom line....Good movie...good 3d....still enjoyed this movie after watching it twice...1 normal...1 3d...A Keeper, good for multiple views.",1225670400,,355,5.472727272727273
3399700,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Contrary to some of the other reviewers who found this movie shallow or otherwise lacking in depth of plot, etc., I'd like to point out the fact that this movie was the top family movie of the season; it premiered in spring 2008, and in my area of the country it was still playing past Labor Day.  Pretty good for a so-called ""shallow"" movie.  It is not the traditional following of the Jules Verne epic book, however, and is refreshingly original, although it interprets areas of the book and follows those who are fans of the original story.  In an age of continual remakes, this one sets itself apart.  My husband and I saw it 6 times this past summer.

That being said, I believe the bulk of the appeal during the summer season were the Disney 3D effects, which, unfortunately, do not translate over to the DVD version.  In the movie theater, for instance, one sees in the first scene a trilobite's antenna reaching out from the screen - at home, on my 60"" media room screen, the effect was completely lost, with and without the 3D glasses provided with the DVD. I tried watching the movie in complete darkness, hoping that would help, but it did not. I even tried the glasses I bought when I saw the movie in the theater - it does bring out a bit of depth, but not at all the cool 3D effects I saw at the movie theater. The 3D glasses which come with the DVD are the typical Blue and Red lenses which (in my case) just make my eyes hurt and really don't do anything special to the movie.  I prefer the glasses which were provided at the movie theater, though they do nothing to enhance the color of the movie, they do add some depth of field, but hardly a 3D effect.  It is the overall entertainment value of this movie that garners four stars.

The movie itself is very family oriented - no foul language, no overtly 'adult' banter; no excessive skin revelation (i.e. cleavage) and nothing the least bit gory.  Scary, perhaps, for small children is the scene with the dinosaur, but other than that, this movie is perfect for family entertainment.  We plan to show it on Thanksgiving to everyone after dinner, so confident are we that grandparents and grandchildren will enjoy it as much as the rest of us.

To sum it up, it is a good movie - not a blockbuster, but certainly entertaining - however the 3D effects were left in the theater.",1225670400,,2344,4.412993039443156
3399701,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Sure, I'll concede that this film hit the target for the intended audience. It's a family action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has much fast paced action, suspense and light humor.

You really have to divorce yourself from reality and even harsh criticism while watching this, because it's very easy for an adult with high-expectations to feel let down. But the truth is, this about the same type of fare as you'll find with films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang/dp/B000WC39ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apple-Dumpling-Gang/dp/B00009YXAV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apple Dumpling Gang</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Kids/dp/B000065V42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>, and so on.

My wife liked it and thought it was entertaining. However, I'm a fan of Jules Verne books and always have been. I guess I was hoping for more of an adult driven, Steampunk style (see comment below) drama than what I saw. I wish the CGI was better and the mood a little less cotton-candy-ish, but it really wasn't aimed at me and I can concede that. I'm not going to give the movie less than the four stars that it does deserve for the simple fact that with every scene, you can see that Brendan Frasier isn't overdoing the acting and delivers a family movie with a family movie level of acting. Kudos to him for being aware of what he was involved in.

This review is about not going into this hoping for an epic telling of a Jules Verne Classic, but going into it with the perspective of seeing a family movie. Hopefully this will help someone.

3399702,2,B0016Q2D5M,"First off I will state that I am not a fan of 3-D movies - ever!! But my husband is so I bought this for his 3-D pleasure while I watched the old fashioned way. His complaints, like so many other reviewers, were that all the glasses did was to make the picture look like red and green. I, however, enjoyed it in all it's 2-D splendor.

My ire was irked, however, when we opened the package. Therein we found a flyer with directions and a code for downloading the movie from our computer. This was accompanied by a blank, recordable DVD. NOTE: This is not good if the buyer is not computer savvy or doesn't own a computer - yes there are many folks who don't and I personally know at least 2 people who don't own home computers.

The next thing to vex me was the fact that once I got to the movie web-site I had to give them my credit card for a $1.99 charge to use their movie manager software which I then had to install on my computer. I was very tempted to just repackage the entire thing and bring it back to the store. But my hubby prevailed. We installed the software and forked out the $1.99 on top of the price of the movie. NOTE: Not a good thing if you feel the movie makers already charge enough for the movie; also not a good thing if you are at all hesitant about installing software from a company you don't know or trust.  NOTE 2: No where, and I mean NO WHERE, on the external packaging was any mention made about having to download the movie.

Once we got the thing into the DVD and on the screen we did enjoy all of the special effects but for me the entire thing was ruined by having to download and spend additional funds. The movie itself was a fun romp through some very futuristic special effects and definitely left itself open to a sequel for the actors since the teenage lead's next reading adventure, as given to him by Trevor, is Atlantis.

3399719,1,B0016Q2D5M,"I was watching for this at the stores, wondering why I was only finding the 2D version before now, so when buying milk at Wal-Mart there was the 3D/2D DVD together with a glow-in-the-dark yo yo at the checkout counter. I looked at the thing briefly just to make sure it was widescreen and I didn't see the awful red/blue (or magenta/green) eyeglasses I wanted to avoid either.

I saw this at the theater in 3D using polarized eyeglasses and wanted the same thing on DVD. I didn't realize polarized 3D couldn't be done for home TV until I read reviews here at amazon.com, wish I had known. Actually if I had given it more thought I could have figured it out eventually. Like someone else said, the DVD package shows colorless 3D eyeglasses. Very misleading if you had seen the movie at a theater and knew the differences in the eyeglasses, this means you can't avoid buying and opening the DVD box to discover what's really inside. I knew anaglyph two color ones were not good for long movie-watching. In fact, I was going to use the polarized ones I got at the theater anyway since those were like regular sunglasses (all plastic) and not paper and cellophane.

What's even worse about this... they put the 3D glasses in with the DVD itself so I found the DVD was scuffed from them rubbing against each other. My first thought was hopefully the 3D side was untouched, and it was, but now I know the 3D side is not the most important thing. I only got around to watching it tonight and the movie was almost unwatchable. Double-images most of the time-- and always when not the focal point of the picture (sometimes I couldn't decide where that was at)-- and colors messed up (as I expected from color glasses).

I enjoyed the 3D experience of JTTCOTE at the theater but this TV version is a poor attempt at keeping the 3D effect. I must admit it did manage to capture some good moments that would otherwise be missed in 2D alone. It was nice that the sepia coloration late in the movie made the 3D effect more pleasant to watch. The beginning of the movie was ridiculous by comparison due to the normal colors being fouled.

As to the movie itself, I think it was fun if not taken seriously. Obviously that was the intent, to be a fun movie. So when they are in danger it never seems like it really. Well, maybe a few different moments at most.

Terrible to know now that I can't ever watch any 3D movies the way I wanted to, in clear full color. I was going to start getting more of them if this had gone right.

If any of you would-be buyers of this DVD see the plastic 3D image on the DVD box first, well, you can probably judge the quality from that... and worse. IMHO buying a good 2D version cheap might be wise if you've been spoiled by the theater version, otherwise it can be a fun watch if your visual pain tolerence is high enough. The movie was plenty good at the theater so this DVD will disappoint many people, so I must say only get it for the adventure and laughs and such but not for the 3D novelty feature unless you never saw it before and can't resist the temptation.",1225584000,2,3086,4.348958333333333

3399736,3,B0016Q2D5M,"Brendan Fraser stars in the latest adaptation of Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" but the real star of the film is, of course, its special effects including 3-D images. Unfortunately I couldn't see the film in 3-D (the theater I went to showed only 2-D version), so please read my review as such, in which ""effects"" means only traditional 2-D special effects.

Probably you already know the film's story as you have read the original book or seen the 1959 version starring James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook. For the new adaptation the Hollywood studio decided on a story that they think is fit for effects. The new adventure story is much simplified: Brendan Fraser's hero Prof. Trevor Anderson is looking for his missing brother; Josh Hutcherson is his nephew Sean who follows his uncle's (and father's) quest; and Anita Briem is a mountain guide Hannah sgeirsson (a nod to ""Hans"" of the 1959 version?) whose father is one of the ""Verneians."" Actually the film is slightly self-referential as our hero finds a clue about his brother in the titular Jules Verne book.

And ... that is all. No ""villains"" appear (except, perhaps, a mean-spirited boss of Fraser's character, a very small role you may forget soon) as this is a family-friendly picture and each scene is obviously borrowed from other films like ""Indiana Jones."" The Jules Verne fans would lament, or even is angry with, the changes done to the source material.

Still as the film is fun. Yes, it may be silly kind of fun, but fun nonetheless as first-time feature film director Eric Brevig (also, visual effect veteran) has provided enough actions to keep the ball rolling. Even seen in 2-D the images are not bad if not great. Yes, I know, the characters are flat and its romance is uninteresting, but still I like the film for what it is, a 90-miinute roller-coaster ride.",1225411200,,1862,4.758513931888545

The bad news: the 3D effect with the glasses is terrible. I was expecting that the DVD would come with the same kind of glasses we got at the movie. Nope, we got the same old cardboard glasses with the red and green cellophane lenses.

The result is that when you watch the movie with the glasses, the colors are really distorted. Everyone looks like they've got a really bad sunburn, light colors are washed out with green. It's just awful. And the 3D effect isn't nearly as good as it was in the theater.

It turns out that my wife saved our glasses from the theater, so we tried them. No luck... no 3D effect.

I would have been willing to pay more for a DVD with the ""real"" glasses and the same 3D effects we saw in the movie. As it is, the glasses that came with this DVD are a complete waste. You would be better off watching the movie with your eyes closed.",1225411200,2,1240,4.19327731092437

It's better than ""Spy Kids 3-D"", but not as good as the 3-D version of ""Polar Express"" DVD.  They have to work on that.  But the 3-D effects had all of us (four watchers) literally jumping at times.  I haven't done that since I was a kid in the theatres back in the '50s.

That same day, Trevor's nephew is dumped on his door step for a few days.  Trevor hasn't seen Sean (Josh Hutcherson) in years.  It looks to be an awkward time until Trevor finds an old copy of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth that his brother had marked up.  As he begins to interpret his brother's comments, he begins to think there may be more going on than he knows about.

As so the two set off to Iceland.  Hiring Hannah (Anita Briem), they set out to recover a probe.  But a series of events find them falling into a magical world.  Can they find their way out?

I went in expecting a highly fun, fantasy adventure.  And I got just what I had bargained for.  The movie takes a fairly healthy dose of suspension of belief, but considering the premise, I didn't have a problem with that at all.

This is a special effects heavy movie with the plot at times being nothing but an excuse for them.  But they were amazing.  And the plot works, too.  Yes, it's predictable, but it is fun, so that didn't matter to me.

Granted, it helped that I cared for the characters.  And the acting by the three leads was good enough to draw me into the story.

For all my praise, I do have two complaints.  The first is the pacing.  The movie took a little too long setting things up before the adventure really started.  Secondly, the ads for the movie gave away too much of the story.  I sure wish marketing departments would figure that out.

The film is rated PG due to the action elements.  It will be too intense for kids who get scared easily.  But any kids who can handle some suspense will love it.

So if you are looking for a family movie night, give this one a chance.  If your kids won't be scared by it, you'll all enjoy an amazing trip.",1225324800,,1980,4.304347826086956

I noticed POLAR EXPRESS is doing the same thing.  FORGET IT.  Stick to the memory of the REAL 3D in the theatre and watch the 2D version.  There is a technique that was used a few years ago for the Rose Parade on new year's day where the camera was constantly panning and moving and the glasses were left eye clear and right eye partially grayed out.  For some reason the messages sent to the brain caused a sense of depth (The JUDDS did a music video in 3D that uses this technique and was very effective).  I've also found that if I wear these glasses with a normaL 2D film, it will add a sense of depth to it and layering.  But red and blue?  Very blurry, ghosty and hard to watch.

3399755,1,B0016Q2D5M,"Whatever the merits of the actual movie, the 3D process used on this DVD (Green/Purple glasses) is simply awful. While the 3D might be great in the theater, this adaptation of the 3D to DVD is intolerably bad. Many 3D DVDs use colored glasses, primarily Red/Cyan or Red/Blue (for instance Spy Kids 3D and Polar Express 3D), but for some reason, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D uses Green/Purple Glasses. With these glasses, the movie is unwatchable due to brightness differences between the two eyes, and the lack of any color reproduction (like watching a black and white movie tinted green.)

Perhaps Amazon could take the time to inform buyers about the 3D system employed by the DVDs they sell. Some are High Quality Field Sequential (HQFS), some are Red/Cyan anaglyph glasses, some are Red/Blue anaglyph glasses, but this is the first I've seen of the Green/Purple system. I hope it'll be my last encounter!

Summary: Totally botched 3D conversion onto DVD! Stay away!

As a side note, many buyers are not aware that some anaglyph DVDs (colored glasses) can look quite good in the home, but only so on certain playback hardware configurations. If your TV is connected to your DVD player with composite video, S-Video, or a modulator (Ch. 3-4, etc...) the colored glasses 3D effect will look terrible. This is because these connections do not provide accurate color information.

The best playback setup would be a computer monitor (either LCD or CRT), or a DVD player connected to your LCD, DLP, or CRT TV set with HDMI or component cables. Movies like Polar Express 3D or Shrek 3D look pretty good with this setup. However, even with a great playback setup, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, is a disaster. Remember that the studio must do a proper conversion from the in-theater polarized source material into the colored glasses source for the DVD. This is where Journey 3D got flushed. Also the choice of Green/Magenta glasses seems to have made the conversion even worse. Although the conversion from polarized to anaglyph requires skill, it is not rocket science. Warner Home Video and New Line Home owe everyone an apology (and a refund) for this botch job.",1225324800,10,2180,4.836461126005362
3399756,3,B0016Q2D5M,"(This review is of the BluRay edition with 3D glasses)
I won't re-review the movie content: the main theatrical review is accurate and I agree with it.
I'm commenting on the 3D effect only.

The movie comes with red/blue 3D glasses (4 pair). The 3D effect is pretty good, but as with all red/blue 3D, the effect goes mostly into the screen, not out from the screen. Theatrical 3D with polarized lenses do both, but that is not technically possible with TV. But it is entertaining, none the less.

The big downside: you wanted a color movie, right? Well, red/blue 3D glasses essentially eliminate color. Everything is very muted, almost sepia in appearance. Look at the same scene in 3D, then in 2D (or just take off the glasses), and you'll quickly see what you are missing.

Overall, I wish they'd stop with this color-robbing 3D stuff on DVD and BluRay. It's a gimmick and removes the reason I have a color TV the first place.

3399758,4,B0016Q2D5M,"This is in regards to the DVD 3-D version of Journey to the Center...

Being a huge fan of the older version, (with Pat Boone), I was very hesitant about this film. However, when I saw that it was in 3-D, I was sold.
Turned out all the lights, put the glasses on and waited to be thrilled.
Well...until now the only video that had truely 3-D effects that I had seen was, 'The Mask'. NOT the Jim Carrey film, but a much older movie about a young man obsessed with a tribal mask. The 3-D in that was very good, in that you could actually see a hand coming out of the screen at one point.
Back to 'Journey...' It is 3-D through-out and it is very good. It is not the kind that makes you think that something is coming at you. Nor does it have the ability to make things appear as if they are floating in space. (I have experienced that in the theaters).

I was surprised that the manufacturer did not include ANY instructions for adjusting your tv for optimal 3-D viewing.
Because of that, we were seeing double images throughout the film. Sometimes getting a bit annoying.
I tried adjusting the color, brightness and hue, but to no avail.

Overall I enjoyed the movie and think that it would be worth watching again.
I wish the 3-D effects had been better. With that said, I will still buy the 'Polar Express 3-D'.
BTW: the tv used for this was a Sony 32"" HD.

The film may be a bit too intense for some children younger than 9 or 10. Most of it is alright for children. (Didn't hear ANY cussing). But, there are a couple of scenes toward the end that may be a bit harsh for some sensitive children. View it yourself first, then judge if it is appropriate for your children.",1225324800,2,1672,4.231974921630094

This movie is a treat to watch in 3D.  I love the floating rocks and the furious flying fish in the movie.

I really liked the special features on this DVD. It features a commentary on every scene of the movie with Brendan Fraser and the director Eric Brevig.  This DVD also features an interview with Josh Hutcherson about his life as a young actor.  There are some fun games to play based on the movie included in this DVD too.

Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?

Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.

Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.

Side A: 2-D in full screen and wide screen

I have no complaints here. The movie looks good and is still simple family fun no matter which version you prefer.

Side B: 3-D in wide screen

Here's my problem with this DVD as it compares to the theater experience. Most who watched it in the movies in 3D will be let down. The movie is a good movie, but not good enough to own. It was the 3D gimmick that made it awesome.

Here are the problems:

1. The 3-D effects are not the same as the way you saw it in the movies.
2. The 3-D effects are more like the gimmicky old school red/blue 3-D-ish movies from the old days.
3. And that's what you get, cheap red/green 3-D glasses that makes the movie barely watchable and truly disappointing.
4. I kept the old 3-D glasses from the movie theater hoping that I would be able to enjoy the 3-D coolness on my 47 inch HD LCD TV, instead I get a quasi 3-D gimmick that greatly disappoints.

Conclusion:

If you are buying this DVD for the simple pleasure of a fun family movie then by all means get it, but if you were expecting some 3-D fun then do not buy it. It will only disappoint you.",1225238400,6,1251,4.140495867768595

I was expecting it to be at least as good as Hannah Montana-Best of both worlds 3-D DVD but it blows that movie away. You use Red/Blue Anaglyph glasses for Hannah Montana but for Journey to the Center of the Earth you use Magenta/Green. WOW!!! What a difference on this movie. I tried using the red/blue glasses but they didn't work. I would say the 3-D effects (not talking about color) is as good as it can get without the huge screen. The things that are suppose to pop out at you really do. You can't expect the colors to be great because you are only using two color glasses so the colors won't be as good as the theater...but you don't notice it as much during darker scenes (when they are inside the earth) which is most of the movie. The surround sound was very good even though it does not have the TrueHD audio format...the rear speakers were very engaging. I will say that not everyone does well with 3-D some people get headaches but do those same people get headaches on amusement parks rides...if so this might not be good for you. For me, I love rides if it doesn't spin me around so for this DVD I highly recommend it on blu-ray.

3399775,5,B0016Q2D5M,I see a review complaining about it being just the basic red/blue 3D that has been around since way back when. This movie does not deserve a bad rating based on that. It is a great flick and you can NOT expect the same 3D you got in the HD 3D theater. The 3D theaters use Stereo Optic 3D which is still IMPOSSIBLE for home use. It would require you to have two projectors and the whole deal like the movie theaters which isn't cheap. It is a GREAT movie with a great little 3D overlay added. It is not as good as the new Stereo Optic 3D theaters but unless you have about 20000 dollars to hook one up for yourself I think you should be pleased.,1225152000,20,644,4.0390625

I'm actually disappointed by Fraser and although I've come to expect him in terrible films, this one just takes the cake and I'm sure that to many this will be the film that will have his fans saying ""that's enough."" I know I've come close to saying that this time around, but I'm prepared to give him one more chance. All I know is that with a virtually unknown supporting cast and quite frankly shoddy CGI effects, there's no doubting the terrible nature of this film.

Stay away, because you really don't want to risk seeing such an atrocity.",1224288000,,2891,4.410112359550562
3399784,3,B0016Q2D5M,"I love a good 3-D movie. My first date with my wife was at a 3-D movie. I'm the author of Walt Disney World with Disabilities, and I've seen every 3-D movie at all the Disney parks more times than I can count (Now those movies have incredible 3-D effects!). Unfortunately the effects in this movie were very weak. The 3-D rarely seemed to pop out at the audience. If it did, it lacked impact. There was so much potential, but it just wasn't used.

Now combine that with a very weak script, plot and character development, and poor special effects even without the 3-D involved, and you have this movie. A good sci-fi movie takes you out of reality and creates another world. You believe it's real for just a couple of hours and you live the adventure. This movie never managed that. We were rather bored.

Brendan Fraser did a good job with what he had to work with, but it just wasn't much. I just can't recommend this movie as a purchase. Maybe just a rental if you have an unlimited rental deal.",1224115200,,998,4.360215053763441

Sean: What?
Trevor: It's a metamorphic rock. Green shist, white shist, micro-guarded shist-
Sean: Oh. Shist.

This adaptation of the Jules Verne classic novel features Trevor, a goofy volcanologist (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, a canny Icelandic tour guide (Anita Briem).

While on a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland to retrieve data from a previously dormant volcanic sensor gadget, the trio emulates Alice by falling down a hole.  Curiouser and curiouser, they end up not in Wonderland, but in a lost world, where long-extinct phosphorescent birds flutter by and the flying fish have a serious case of overbite.

Using the storyline of a missing brother and misunderstood Vernian volcanologists, the little group wanders around the treacherous terrain, overcoming insurmountable odds and horrible hardship (Eat your Trilobite, Sean) before reaching the grandly preposterous finale.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Three down the shist hole
2. Things start heating up
3. Underground ocean crossing brings separation anxiety
4. Tyrannosaurus wrecks
5. Geyser erupts with ""flare""
6. Strong hint of ""to be continued""

A little Goonies, a little Indiana Jones and a lot of tongue-in-cheek adventure, this movie is great as far as light entertainment goes, and can be viewed by the whole family.

He's in action movies that have a light, bantering tone, but yet the stories have incredible creatures, scary chases, wild special effects, but a ""Look folks, no hands, only kidding"" kind of approach. This handsome, still boyish looking actor, manages to look terrified and can scream his head off in the face of danger. The character is bright, but you suspect there's a dumb streak lurking below the surface.
 He, a science prof, and his nephew, Josh Hutcheson playing Sean, go to Iceland where they join up with pretty Hannah, go climbing and end up falling to the center of the earth where there is a huge amount of space, plenty of light, a horizon, and apparently plenty of oxygen.
 Scary highlights: 1. Sean has to cross a deep chasm by jumping from one magnetic floating rock to another with one rock orbiting while he's clinging aboard. 2. Man-eating very toothy fish with real overbites attack the three on an elaborate raft that they were apparently to build in about a day without tools. 3. Prehistoric drooling monsters like raptors chase the uncle and nephew and almost gobble them up. 4. Huge, very hungry carnivorous plants attack Fraser and Hannah. Watch Fraser take care of the last plant, and you'll know why this is part braggadocio spoof.
 This is good escapist stuff that will entrance you as long as you don't start asking too many dumb questions. It's a thrilling adventure, scary and fun. Fraser is a winning action hero.",1220054400,2,1588,4.725631768953068

There is a touching sequence in the middle to keep us grounded.  And there are several spectacular action sequences building up to the conclusion.  In my favorite sequence Hutcherson finds himself walking across huge boulders and rocks suspended by a magnetic field, hundreds of feet from the ""ground.""  He must jump from rock to rock as you would in crossing a stream, but with a much scarier potential fall.  It's hard to do justice to this part in words; you have to see it.

I like both movies.

Of all the 3D films I've seen, this is the best for several reasons - acting isn't sacrificed, the story stands alone, and the 3D is refined since a couple years ago.  I see 2 movies a week and so far this is my favorite of the year.

Warning:  The above review was written for the theatrical release of the film.  Now that I've bought the DVD it turns out they did not use the same excellent 3D system on the DVD as in the theatres, which used a new kind of glasses.

The actors: Branden Fraser is his usual affable, comedic, heroic self; although, he has starred in some dark movies, ""Gods and Monsters"" and the ""R+"" rated, ""Journey to the End of the Night.""(Stick with this journey.

3399825,4,B0016Q2D5M,"By definition, what you like or enjoy is subjective.  Whether or not something is of a certain quality is more debatable.  In between, lands films like this that you can enjoy quite a bit while readily admitting it might be one of the dumber films you've ever watched.  I would not dare debate the artistic quality of this film other than the stunning visuals and appropriate acting.  At the heart of most film is the story.  This story is so stupid and full of nonsense, that enjoying it automatically falls in the ""Guilty Pleasure"" category, only without the guilt.  Let's quickly chop it up to make this clear.

-OH SO STUPID!!
This film has so many scientific inaccuracies, so gleefully digs enormous plot holes, so often defies probabilities, so boldly slaps the face of logic and so blatantly ignores physics that suspension of disbelief is nearly forced upon you; ""Don't even START to believe ANY of this!!!"" the film makers seam to be shouting.  I accepted this like the sugar coated pill that it is.  Even with the stupidity, the concept was actually pretty cool; Jules Vern was using REAL sources.  My biggest complaint is they spent too much time developing a back story and a prelude to the action.  Even though those aspects weren't poorly thought out, it actually detracted from the bold stupidity of the rest of the film.

-I LIKE BRENDAN FRASER
Here's a guy who currently is really good at only one thing; playing the capable yet imperfect, attractive but not handsome, intelligent yet simple, irritating but admired, reluctant but heroic ""everyman"".  Talk about type-casting!!!  Other than his cartoon adaptations (bad ideas to begin with), I can't think of one film he's done that I haven't enjoyed a lot.  Whether it was ""Bedazzled"" or ""The Mummy"" series, I always feel good after watching his movies.  He really has a talent for acting like we think we would (or at least WISH we would) if put in the same situations.  The other actors didn't hurt this film either.

-LIKE A DISNEY 3D ATTRACTION
If you've ever been to any of the Disney theme parks, you've probably seen a 3D attraction of some sort (Honey, we Shrunk the Audience"" comes to mind).  Well, if you have, that is what this film is like for one and a half hours.  Anyway, needless to say, it's extremely cool regardless of the films inherent problems.  My kids were reaching for stuff coming out of the screen and my wife jumped out of her skin a couple times; a real thrill ride.  A lot of screams and giggles occurred throughout the audience.  As most have stated; without 3D this film is rather pointless but still ok.

-SET PIECE HEAVEN
After the initial (boring) set up, the film progresses from one cool and silly set piece to another.  Each scene plays out almost like a video game;
-Confront strange new environment.
-Solve the puzzle/beat the challenge.
-Move to the next set piece.
I have to say, this made it all a lot of fun without ever challenging your brain; sometimes its fun to turn your brain off.

-RECOMMENDATION
This is the first time I took my son to a film where he shouted out ""That was AWESOME!!!"" after a scene.  Though shamefully derivative and sometime scary, my kids absolutely loved it.  My wife and I had fun despite the unparalleled suspension of disbelief.  I would put this in a similar category with the original ""Tomb Raider"" film; a turn your brain off thrill ride.  The big difference is that this one is even less probable yet more family friendly.

The story was a fun take off of the Jules Verne classic, by not trying to tell it as a period piece, and for my money, Brenden Fraser continues to be great as an action star.

Here's the funny thing though, the theater was out of the 3D Glasses so we watched it without the special 3D effects and still thought that it was a way fun ride! So much so, that we went back and watched it again with the 3D glasses so we could get the whole fun. Without the 3D we thought it was a 4star movie but with the 3D it was way a 5Star movie!

Without 3-D **

I find it more than a little ironic that ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", the new film starring Brendan Fraser and Josh Hutcherson, is being billed as the first ""Live Action"" film created in the new 3-D process. Ironic because this 'live action' film is basically as cartoonish as any animated film. But it is a fun experience nonetheless. However, if I didn't see the film in 3-D, it wouldn't be worth the time and effort.

Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a science professor struggling to keep his missing brother's research into plate tectonics alive, is quickly reminded that his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson, ""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""Zathura"") is coming for a visit when he and his mom show up on his doorstep. Mom is off to Canada to set-up their new home. In 10 days, Sean will board a plane and rejoin her. Sean's mom gives Trevor a box of her husband's things, because she can't bear to live with them any longer. Trevor realizes there are notes in his brother's copy of Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" and soon connects this with some plate activity that suddenly re-appears on one of their monitors. Trevor becomes excited and decides they have to travel to Iceland. Immediately. As they take the long plane ride, Trevor reads through the dog-eared copy of the book and announces, ""There is a society of people who believe Jules Verne's writings were real"", something Trevor and his missing brother apparently both believe, so he uses the paperback as a sort of map or guidebook (can Rick Steve's be far behind?). They soon hook up with Hannah (Anita Briem, TV's ""The Tudors"") and before you can spell ""Centre"", they fall through a small crack in the Earth. Thankfully, just in case we missed it, Trevor announces, ""I give you... the Center of the Earth."" They are soon careening down railroad tracks on runaway mine cars, trying to outrun living dinosaurs and trying to escape molten lava. And they only have a few days to do it; the area where they are is heating up and it will soon be too hot for them to survive.

""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", directed by Eric Brevig, a former special effects supervisor on many films, is a decidedly fast-paced film. While this is a good thing, the director is not able to handle this fast pace and the special effects, and at the same time also develop the story and character. I suspect that because this is his first film as a director, he is not able to handle all of these various elements with the same degree of skill. His work on the special effects for films like ""The Village"", ""K-19 The Widowmaker"", ""The Island"", ""Signs"", ""and Pearl Harbor"" provided the resume securing the job for him. The filmmakers were looking to create a fast-paced story, filled with thrills, which could be exploited for 3-D. Story and characters be damned.

The thing about Brendan Fraser is that he is always the perfect fit for these types of roles, the sillier, the better. He has the dashing good looks, non-threatening charisma, and silly charm perfect for these 'matinee idol' throwback type roles he seems to relish. Kids, tweens, adults, everyone can find something to like in Brendan Fraser. It also helps that he isn't a very good actor. He is always more enjoyable in films like ""The Mummy"" (and it's sequels) and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", loud, fast-paced movies surrounding the actor with a ton of stuff going on, to help distract us from his, at best, sitcom style of acting. When they arrive at ""The Center of the Earth"", Trevor announces, ""I give you... the Center of the Earth"". Just in case we missed it. The dramatic pause is also necessary to make sure we realize how dramatic it is. Not very subtle. The characters are almost always running away from, hurtling towards something or trying to escape some impending bit of danger. Because of this, they almost never have time to take a breath, let alone try to create a character or build any emotion.

Sadly, when Fraser plays a more normal person, with the lone exception of ""Gods and Monsters"", the characters are nowhere near as interesting. Yes, he is good looking, but unless he is shouting or running away from some CGI creation, he doesn't seem as believable somehow.

Josh Hutcherson has a more difficult time. Initially, Sam is supposed to be your typical teen, surly, uncommunicative and unresponsive. But he too quickly abandons this persona for the sake of the story. There isn't time for him to remain this way, because they have to work together to escape a dinosaur, or to navigate rickety mine cars, or to find their way out of ""The Center of the Earth"". He quickly coverts and joins the cause.

Anita Briem is pretty much negligible. You recognize the need for a female to be in the group, but the pretext for her to be around is shaky at best. During the course of the film, Trevor and Hannah are supposed to set off some sparks, but they fall into the same trap set-up by the filmmakers. Everything is moving too fast. There isn't time for a conversation to begin, let alone a romance. So when they finally kiss (like that's a surprise) it is extremely forgettable.

I was also a bit surprised that so much of the film is brown or orange. I know they are in the center of the Earth, but everything takes on this dull glow giving the film an almost monotone appearance and it looks washed out. After they arrive in ""The Center of the Earth"", a small blue bird appears. The product of CGI artists, this bird almost becomes a bit of a mascot for the adventurous threesome. But it sticks out, a lot, because it is so different in color and really draws you eye away from everything else. It also serves to make the overall color scheme stand out all the more and makes everything seem more brown, more orange and more dull.

Early on, the characters find a map which promises to point them towards a geyser they are sure will help them escape. As soon as this document appears, this becomes the main thrust of the narrative. Everything they do is about finding this geyser, never mind the fact ""The Center of the Earth"" is heating up...

Let's pause for a moment... At one point, Trevor realizes they are now in an area that is 115*. Yet, despite all of the running around, very little sweat...

They have to escape to the surface. And when they do escape, they pop up in a different part of the world. Initially, this is surprising, but if you think about it, ""The Center of the Earth"" would be smaller, so the fact they end up in... Wait a minute! I am wasting too much time trying to make an implausible story plausible. More time than the filmmakers spent trying to make everything work out. So when Trevor, Sam, and Hannah pop up in this other part of the world, it is done for laughs. Look at the funny local with his funny accent. Har-har.

As much as there is to dislike about this film, there is something about putting on a pair of 3D glasses that just makes it better. As soon as you slip those glasses on, you become a part of a collective group, a group that is about to experience something. As much as going to the multiplex to experience a movie is a group experience, and heightens everything somehow (comedies are often funnier when you hear other people laughing, dramas more dramatic when you hear sniffles), the 3D glasses make the whole thing even better. You're part of a group about to experience a ""new"" thing together. And the technology has greatly improved. There are no longer little red and blue lines around some of the images. The technology, while still not perfect, is more seamless and seems to be better for all people, whether you wear glasses or not. It's a lot of fun to sit in a packed audience with a bunch of friends and even more strangers and experience a roller coaster ride like this together.

So far, this technology has been best used for animated films like ""Monster House"", Disney's ""Meet the Robinsons"" and a re-release of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I think the technology still lends itself better to this medium. When watching live action in 3D, too many surfaces become flat and begin to resemble cardboard cut outs on different planes. In animated films, these same problems seem to blend in more generically.

Of course, they encounter dinosaurs and sea monsters and attack fish that make pirahnas look like minnows.

Although it seemed like they got back to the present place kind of quickly (or so it seemed) the movie was still a lot of fun. The whole thing was in 3D, unlike some other past movies that are only 3D in part.

Just in case anyone reading does not know what 3D is: You wear special 3 Dimensional glasses to watch these movies (which they gave you at the theater).  Then objects in the movie have depth to them.  They stand out like the objects you see in real life, as opposed to objects appearing flat on a screen.

3399830,3,B0016Q2D5M,"I thought this was an okay summer action flick.  It won't win any awards, and I think it's only good for one-time viewing, but it kept me interested in the movie until the end.  Of course, I think the fact it was 3-D helped some as the 3-D parts did cause the ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" and were neat to watch on the screen.  Watching objects fly out toward you and reach for you is always fun to watch.

Unfortunately, other than the 3-D effects, the movie wasn't all that great.  Characters are somewhat flat, there wasn't much you knew about any of the characters besides surface level details.

Also, the world beneath the surface wasn't fully developed and explored.  Sure, there were a few action-packed scenes (the ride on the ocean with the sea monsters, the chase by the T-rex, and the man-eating plant scene), but I felt a bit disappointed.  I was expecting to see *more* of this underground world, but there wasn't much given, before the main characters all leave to the surface.  Another thing that puzzled me was the little glowing bird that followed the nephew of the professor, Trevor, everywhere.  Oh well, it was a cute little glowing blue bird, but I felt it was a bit pointless and didn't do anything except make you, the viewer, think, ""Aw, how cute!!"" LOL.

I felt there also wasn't enough conflict either, not much struggle while they are in this underground world.  Not much going on, of course, I noticed a lot of people bringing their families to this movie so maybe the less unpleasant conflicts going on the better.

My opinion:  I think perhaps the makers of the movie decided to skimp out on a lot of substance and meat to the story and instead relied on 3-D effect to carry the movie.  It is easy to be distracted by the 3-D effects, and not notice that the movie is lackluster.  If you like 3-D movies, go see it for the 3-D, but not for any good storyline.",1215993600,7,1879,4.4662756598240465
3399831,2,B0016Q2D5M,"I rarely give less than 3 stars for a movie, because I always find enough little things to like about the mediocre ones to push me over the hump. Not the case here. If this wasn't in 3-D, it might have made my top 10 worst movies I have ever seen in theater list. The acting, dialogue and pacing were terrible. It seemed like it took forever just to get down in the Earth so the action could begin. Brendan Fraser was annoying as usual, and the kid just made things worse.

The only saving grace for me was the 3-D, though it wasn't as amazing as the visuals of Beowulf. There were a couple of neat scenes involving carnivorous fish and plants. Special mention to the mouthwash on the face 3-D effect early in the film.

If you got kids who want to see it, take them to the showing where you have to wear the funny glasses, otherwise Journey to the Center of the Earth will be torture to sit through.",1215907200,,900,4.196531791907514
3399832,4,B0016Q2D5M,"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

3399834,3,B0016Q2D5M,"""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" would be the ultimate theme park ride were it possible to build. So many moments of this film are as fast paced and exciting as an extensively themed roller coaster, with a lot of falling and flying and escaping set against the backdrop of elaborate special effects. This actually poses a bit of a problem: just as theme park guests ignore the story of a ride, so too will audiences ignore the story of this film. The filmmakers most likely did this on purpose, seeing as there isn't much of a story being told. It's all about the visuals, which can be experienced in 3-D if you go to the right theater (mine only offered a traditional 2-D presentation). There's nothing wrong with great visuals, but they're always a lot more tolerable when coupled with a solid plot. An attempt is made in this case, but it's weak even at best.

Those of you expecting a direct adaptation of Jules Verne's novel will be greatly disappointed, especially since both author and story are mentioned by name throughout the film. It's more of a springboard, a way for the filmmakers to tell their own story and introduce original characters. First, there's Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a disorganized but dedicated earth scientist. He teaches a college course no one wants to take, and his lab is understaffed, under-funded, and completely disrespected by the other faculty. Despite his problems, he remains passionate about seismology, volcanology, and plate tectonics, much like his brother, Max, who disappeared in 1997 while doing fieldwork in Iceland.

While his sister-in-law prepares to move to Canada, Trevor is left with his standoffish teenage nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson). He's also left with an old box full of Max's things, one of which is a copy of Jules Verne's novel marked with notes. Trevor compares the notes to his own scientific data and realizes that Max was on to something big; it seems that the world's most seismically active sites contain passages the lead deep beneath the earth, and this suggests that Verne's writing was not mere science fiction. Trevor and Sean immediately book a flight to Iceland to find Sigurbjrn sgeirsson, an earth scientist who had known Max and shared the same passion for ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" When they arrive, they instead find his daughter, Hannah (Anita Briem), an avid mountain climber. While she loved her father very much, she never believed Verne's book was anything other than fiction.

Despite having just met them, Hannah agrees to guide Trevor and Sean up a volcano so that Trevor can do a bit of fieldwork. A sudden thunderstorm forces them into a cave, and after a couple of hair-raising close calls, they fall through a thin sheet of rock all the way to Earth's center. They then discover a dangerous yet amazing world of glowing birds, magnetic rocks, carnivorous fish, gigantic Venus flytraps, still-living dinosaurs, and underground oceans. ""A world within the world,"" Trevor muses, realizing his brother and Hannah's father were right all along. Unfortunately, they have to get back to the surface as soon as possible. The temperature is rapidly rising, and they only have so much time before a volcanic geyser is ready to erupt.

I grant you that all of this is fun to watch, and while I was unable to see it in 3-D, I understood how the effect was supposed to work on the audience. The sheer number of objects flying towards the camera is enormous, pretty much to the point of being obvious. The thing is, I want more than three-dimensional images assaulting my field of vision--I want to be told a story, and I don't care if it isn't believable. The story for this new ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a bit flimsy, probably because it didn't seem like the actors fully believed what they were doing; their performances were restrained, as if they were just rolling along with the punches. Not bad, but definitely not great. If they aren't convinced of the material, how can the filmmakers expect the audience to be?

Nevertheless, the film has its moments. There's a touching scene between Fraser and Hutcherson taking place on a beautifully lit shoreline, and while I won't describe what happens or reveal what they say to each other, I will say that it felt the most authentic in terms of character development. And yes, the special effects are quite good, most likely because they didn't look completely real. Strange as it sounds, the last thing a story this preposterous needs is a realistic look. Take, for example, a frenetic scene in which all three characters coast through expansive caverns aboard runaway mine cars; instead of the tracks going in simple straight lines, they swoop and curve and suddenly drop. There's even a sizeable gap that they have to jump across.

My point is that it's more exciting for a film to be outrageous than to be realistic. However, it was annoying that the mine car scene was copied from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" a much better film in all respects. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" takes us on a ride and gives us plenty to look at, but it doesn't really give us anything to remember, certainly not as far as characters or story are concerned. I have no doubt that children will love this film, especially if they have access to a theater showing it in 3-D. But most other people will see it as nothing more than a mildly amusing distraction, a way to kill ninety minutes out of the house. See it if you must. See it many times in a row, if it suits your fancy. Some people love riding the same amusement park ride over and over again.",1215734400,,5623,4.738508682328907
