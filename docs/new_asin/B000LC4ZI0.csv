2704181,4,B000LC4ZI0,"I really liked season one. This one, I felt was not quite as good. Considering the battle at the end of season one, I though it was bit of a cope out the way, they saved Atlantis.",1167436800,5,179,3.864864864864865
2704182,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Stargate Atlantis is one show you really hate to miss. With the arrival of Season 2 on DVD, well, now you can partake in the adventure whenever you want.

I have been waiting, too, for it to be available via DVD. For some reason, they were SLOW to get this series on DVD, even with the major success of Stargate SG1. It's still not in my local stores or Sam's Club. However, you can always rely on Amazon to have it.

The action and the stories are fun, unique and adventurous. The people who are annoying remain annoying. And the villains, VILLAINOUS. I love the characters...and tolerate the scientist that you would prefer to slap and tell to shut up! Ronan does that from time to time, as well as others.

Ronan was a successful new character introduction, and a good parallel to Teyla and Sheppard. I also like it that Weir gets stronger throughout the series.

As Stargate SG1 struggles to find it's footing with the principle cast taking a leave of absence, you can count on Atlantis to be the fantasy adventure story you can sink your teeth into.

Ok...the Ori story has resurged a breath of fresh air in SG1.

My advice...get them ALL. Atlantis has so many fresh twists, it is an original, not a clone of SG1. My wish is that they continue to thrive and continue to develop interesting and compelling story lines. I love it!

Live long and prosper, Atlantis.",1167436800,25,1367,4.510121457489879
2704183,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Continuing straight forward from the cliffhanger at the end of Season 1, Stargate Atlantis continues to bring more elements from the Stargate universe and opens up new questions regarding the Wraith, the Genii, and the dark turn that Lt. Aiden Ford (played by Rainbow Sun Francks) has taken in this action-driven season.  New elements are skillfully introduced with the addition of the Daedalus, a brand-new battlecruiser commanded by Col. Steven Caldwell (Mitch Pillegi).  A runner named Ronon Dex (Jason Momoa) joins the cast of Atlantis along with former recurring cast member Paul McGillion as the loveable Scottsman Dr. Carson Beckett.  As a strong fan of Stargate Atlantis, and Stargate SG-1, I can confidentally say that this series is well worth the time for any sci-fi fan or anyone with an interest in action programs.",1165622400,48,828,5.164179104477612
2704184,5,B000LC4ZI0,"The second season of Stargate Atlantis begins on an adrenaline high with the third and final part of Season One's ""The Siege"" and the action doesn't end with the season opener.  One character departs the show as a regular to make room for model, turned bad-boy, Jason Momoa, who plays Ronon Dex, a Wraith Runner; while a new group of the Atlantis Expedition arrives from Earth aboard the newest ship in the fleet, the Daedelus.  This season, helped by the amazing chemistry of the cast, shows its maturity early with story lines that can be enjoyed as separate episodes while giving die-hard fans a well thought out story arc involving the Wraith, Ancients and other interesting discoveries from the Pegasus Galaxy.

Overall Atlantis has not only met fan's expectations but has slowly exceeded its parent series, Stargate SG-1.  If you're a fan of the Stargate Movie and haven't seen an episode of SG-1 I highly recommend buying the first nine seasons on DVD before jumping through the gate to Atlantis, however any fan of Sci-Fi would covet these Atlantis DVD sets.",1165276800,58,1066,4.87292817679558

2704305,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Stargate Atlantis was a great series. It only lasted half as long as Stargate SG1, and didn't have the wonderful cast of Stargate SG1, but I enjoyed the series as much as the original Stargate series. I only watched a few episodes of Stargate Universe. The original Stargate series was fun and witty. Stargate Atlantis continued with the fun and wit, but Stargate Universe was dark and dumb, with an unlikeable cast.

Stargate SG1 is a great example of taking a mediocre movie, the source material, and turning it into an outstanding franchise with the longest running sci-fi series in history, although Supernatural is now the longest running fantasy series in history.

When Im not watching episodic storytelling Im reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy.

Sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ray Bradbury, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, William R. Forstchen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, George Orwell, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R.

I have to pay again for something that I'm already paying for, probably not. Fortunately my free membership runs out in 2 days and it makes that decision easy for me.

2704462,5,B000LC4ZI0,The show is great however Amazon decided to stop running the program under Prime. You now have to purchase HULU to watch it. Their stand on it is simply it is what it is!

2704463,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I just got back into the show  (which is amazing) and as a college student found it included in my prime membership. I was really happy about this since I'm a biology major with a fascination with history and space.
Unfortunately Amazon took it off prime within the last 2 weeks and I can't watch it to give a truly good review (since it costs money I, a broke college student, do not have).

2704587,5,B000LC4ZI0,I love the entire Stargate Atlantis series and season 2 introduces some major reoccurring plots and characters.

2704656,4,B000LC4ZI0,"This is a good yarn. The acting is first rate. Basically this is a series of morality plays that are remakes of old cowboys & Indians shows we all grew up loving, except the good guys fort is called Atlantis, the Indians are ""Wraith"" and the cowboys are a motley collection of scientists and refugees, led by a beautiful woman and a hot headed young Major - think Clint Eastwood, as Rowdy Yates. This is entertainment, and overall, very good entertainment. There are times when the political correctness gets a bit thick for my taste, and times when it descends into syrupy soap opera a bit more than I care for. After all, we don't watch this for morality & philosophy. We are tuned in to see the cowboys in a flying station wagon, slaughter the very ugly Indians with bad teeth.",1475798400,,780,4.5

2704769,4,B000LC4ZI0,A change in actors - replacing Rainbow Sun Frankes with Jason Momoa brightened up the chemistry in this ensemble cast.  Good move!  This show does not take itself seriously / but had wonderful inside jokes hidden in the dialogue and a respect for previous SYFY classic Space Operas.  It is entertaining and good family fare.

Ended up watching it later on and never got into the other series and spin-offs they had during its time.  Was pleasantly surprised with the cast and the series as a whole.  Very good if you enjoy good old Stargate Sci-fi you'll enjoy this.  With cameos of old/new faces from the previous series as well.

2704977,5,B000LC4ZI0,"This is just good Sci-Fi. Yes, it falls for some of the classic tropes, but it misses more typical pitfalls than it falls for. Atlantis manages to have a cast chock full of beautiful women that are almost never the ""damsel in distress"" or the typical 7 of 9 or T'pol ""boobs in a catsuit"" window dressing they made fun of in Galaxy Quest. I think the way they handle the female members of the team on this show is much more realistic in terms of their roles on the team and in their opportunities to both experience and overcome peril.

There are also a lot of good stories here that break from the regular pattern as well. I especially like that the Ancients are massive dicks and that they failed as often as they succeeded in terms of their technology. I always had problems with how they handled the Asgardians in SG1. I felt like a race that advanced just wouldn't beheave like it did in a lot of situations they were in but not so with the Ancients. Heels through and through for the most part.

If I have complaints it's that the wraith are really very foil and I never felt like they really represented a legitimate threat. I also feel like they use McKay and the Daedalus as magical hand-wavey deus ex machina way too frequently. They try to balance McKay out by making him about 50/50 brilliant and incompetent and to be fair he does cause almost as many disasters as the wraith but still, between him and Carson the brilliant surgeon who's also the most advanced geneticist and virologist known to human king, it seems like they reached their budget for casting before they filled out the script's crew complement. You need like 3 more people at least to make this stuff believable even with Ancient technology involved",1470009600,,1729,4.503184713375796

2705154,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Until Stargate Sg1 premiered(1997) my favorite sci-fi TV show was Star Trek DS9 and my second favorite was Star Trek Voyager(I don't care how bad critics and some fans hated it) go Trek. Then in 2004 Atlantis premiered and it became my favorite sci-fi series to date. Even surpassing Eureka and Warehouse 13 which are in my top 10 best sci-fi TV shows ever. I particularly like the chemistry between Chief Scientist/Physicist Rodney McKay(David Hewlett) and Colonel John Sheppard(Joe Flanigan), they kind of remind me of Laurel and Hardy(comedy/slapstick duo from 1926-1950). When Rodney becomes too much of a cynical smart a__ Sheppard threatens him with a lemon which McKay is deathly allergic to. The acting was well above average and if you watch carefully you can tell that on occasion some of the dialogue is ad libbed. The special effects and CGI is excellent and the stage sets are remarkable, especially some of the scenes which are supposed to be outside but are really on a sound stage. There are a few episodes that really stand out for me. ""The Tower,"" episodes with the Genii, Todd the Wraith, Lucius Lavin, the episode with Daniel Jackson and many other too numerous to mention. If you like Stargate Sg1 the chances are you will like Atlantis.",1464393600,2,1258,4.855813953488372
2705155,5,B000LC4ZI0,Next to Stargate SG1 the best sf tv series to date another one would be Smallville and Sons of Anarcy and Lost all great tv series done to entertain and with thrown in plot twisters to add to the fun of watching,1464307200,,211,4.0476190476190474

2705168,3,B000LC4ZI0,"Many of the plots are derivative--The Intruder, Duet, Epiphany, The Tower, The Long Goodbye, and others--that were executed better on other shows. Once the stories get away from the threat of the Wraith, they get somewhat familiar, and uninspiring. I love the Stargate franchise but this season has been somewhat disappointing.

2705203,5,B000LC4ZI0,"The season continues to be very enjoyable.  It seems that the writers took everything that they learned from Stargate SG-1 and put it to good use in this series.  The Wraith continue to be an ever present threat, in fact the season starts out with the Wraith just about wiping out Atlantis it is only through some trickery that they are able to escaped destruction.  You also learn more about the ancients, in one episode you meet ancients trying to ascend, in another episode you meet a group of ancients in one of their warships trying to make it home.  There continue to be episodes that you learn more about or highlight one of the main characters.  The Genii are also make their presence known for good and for bad.  The season ends with a experiment that went astray (using a retrovirus on the Wraith) that maybe allows for a union between a faction of the Wraith and the Atlantians.",1462406400,2,889,4.525

2705267,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I am reviewing this as a parent. This is the first TV show I have invited into our home-EVER. I picked up the DVD set at the library for myself to watch when I wasn't feeling well (we don't watch TV in our home and I don't have Netflix). My 12 year old got her hands on it and after much trepidation ( I was originally kicking myself after seeing the Wraith in Season 1-WAY TOO SCARY!!), we watched it together and it has turned out to be a major bonding session while we watch the show. As I mentioned, the Wraith are completely terrifying (I had weird dreams initially, I am finally over it!) and I was worried about depositing that into her mind. I am somewhat conservative and I don't believe in introducing ideas to children prematurely. That being said, after getting so deep in Season 1 we could not escape, this series has pleased me immensely. Little to no inappropriate language, no sexual suggestiveness (SO GRATEFUL!!), no main characters sleeping with each other every chance they get, strong female characters, an interesting story line, concepts that encourage thinking, and so much action I can't believe they were able to keep coming up with new episodes!! Of course, the series is not perfect, however, the fact that there is a quality show that a family can watch together (I would not recommend for under 12- 13 or 14 is probably best) is enough to make us lifelong fans! Thanks Amazon for offering this on Prime!!",1459900800,4,1434,4.583657587548638

The wraith are a formidable opponent as are the replicators. The characters are engaging, fun and keep you watching to see what happens next!  Though the original series characters only make guest appearances, you quickly come to care about the Atlantis crew all on their own merits.

thousands of years.  Also our planet is being flooded with information from these beings from other worlds.

of Nevada Las Vegas.  The material is defined at the web site of Urantia.org.  The other worldly beings
that gave us this material are teaching us that the cosmos consists of 7 super universes and one central universe.
We are part of the 7th of the 7 super universes.  Each of these universes consists of something like 1 trillion planets.
Thus with something like 7 trillion or more planets in the cosmos what is the probably of at least one of the species
THAT  inhabit these planets behaving like the RATH!  OUCH ON THAT THOUGHT!",1440201600,,957,4.594117647058823
2705787,3,B000LC4ZI0,"Stargate atlantis is a pretty good series. BUT, the fact is for an expedition / endeavor that is to be the most important in human history, Dr. Weir was absolutely the wrong choice for a mission leader. Think about this, just 6 months prior to Dr. Weir heading off to lead this expedition she was beginning her command of stargate command (Right after the 3 month ""review board"") So, she poorly runs the SGC for a grand total of 6 months, only to resign and then be selected to ""lead"" the atlantis expedition. Now having only known about the stargate / new reality for 9 or 10 months, your telling me the world leaders and international comity select a ""business broker"", to go find and retrieve atlantis? BS

At this point in the stargate series the ONLY clear choice would be SG1 and Hammond to lead this expidition. As oppsosed to Dr. Weir's supposed knowledge of ""ancient tech"" having only studied the antartic outpost for a month, wouldn't Dr. Daniel Jackson, having already studied ""ancient tech"" for 10 years have been a more reasonable choice. Wouldn't General Hammonds knowledge of having lead stargate command for 8 or 9 years have been a better mission commander? Also, as an alterative, retired general Jack Oneill would have filled the mission commander just fine as a civilian.

Lets face it, with an ego so large that he thinks he's gods gift to save the ""universe"", Rodney McCey is a jack ass who nobody even wants to watch his idiot personality. Furthermore in 80% of the situations he supposedly ""Saves the day"". He CAUSED them to begin with, by screwing with stuff way over his head. Samantha Charter had already proven herself from before the stargate was opened, maybe what? 15 years experience? Samantha Carter should have been the leader of the front line gate team at atlantis.

Teal'c having no real interest in the pegasus galaxy would have probably stayed behind. No problem, the best member of the entire atlantis expedition was already there, ""Roanan"" . Isn't it interesting that the 2 most reasonable, and persistently have the moral high ground over all the others, and rightly so, is ""Roanan and kayla""  and they weren't even part of the atlantis expedition to begin with.

But most of all Dr. Weir has no business running any expedition, much less one of this importance. Do i have a problem with female leaders? Nope, Samantha Carter is a far better leader. I say, if SG1 had been the ones selected to recover Atlantis, it would have been back to earth in under 6 months.

Here is just one instance of ludacris leadership by Dr. Weir. Season 2 episode ""Inferno"" introduces the atlantian warship renamed as the ""Orion"". Now, Orion having 1 or 2 ""ZPM's"". Is sitting there hidden and parked light years away and wraith ship is on long range scanners. The very next Episode ""Season 2 episode 'Allies'"", last episode of season 2, here comes the Wraith ship, hails them, say's they want to negotiate / blackmail them. So Dr. Weir is in the position that the single hive ship has blackmailed her that they will give away altantis' location if they do not comply. Well At her disposal is the 1 or 2 ZPM's in warship Orion, as well as the earth starship Daedalus is there. Wether its 1 or 2 ZPM's doesn't matter, the city can intersteller flight AND launch Drone weapons. So you take the ZPM from the hidden Orion ship. Use Atlantis and Daedalus to destroy the single wraith hive. Open hyperspace window to a new location with both Atlantis and Daedalus. Once Atlantis is relocated you take the ZPM onboard Daedalus and Hyperspace Daedalus back to the Orion. Then Hyperspace both back to orbit the new planet Atlantis is on. Problem solved, Atlantis hidden again with 2 warships in orbit as a protective cover.

So, instead how does Dr. Weir handle it? Dr. Weir trusts the enemy, ""Even though the whole conversation started with blackmail"", and ends up with a 1.5 years of dealing with ""Michael the half converted Wraith"" and in the end having to sacrifice Orion to protect Atlantis. (And having to relocate atlantis ANYWAY)

So after having stuck around so long that they awakened every enemy in the entire pegasus galaxy , ""Including a replicator home planet"" who does the earth international comity replace her with? Oprah listening homo Richard Woolsie. Who just happens to be the only person they could find who was WORSE than Dr. Weir. (Which is questionable because at least he got atlantis back to earth)

I gave it 3 star for creativity on episodes and seasons. But i find the whole character selection of a band of 3rd rate misfits as highly improbable, compared to who would actually be selected for such an important endevour",1440115200,,4662,4.724477244772448

Although I couldn't quite relate to the main characters as thoroughly as the brilliant cast of Stargate SG-1, the writing is just as imaginative. Rachel Luttrell is a heroine to match the superb Amanda Tapping of SG-1, who gets the occasional guest shot. Joe Flanigan makes a noble effort, but can't quite equal the combination of Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Ben Browder.

2706089,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I really like this series.  The characters are likable, they seem to work well together and the visual effects are good.  Also the female characters are strong and seem to be part of the team rather than just stuck In as a potential love interest later for the male characters.  In fact, none of the main characters get romantically involved with each other at all, I love that.  Also the martial arts fighting is good, not like some other science fiction where the fighting seems to be in slo mo and not believable at all.  Also it has a very stylish look to the sets and the city, lots of stained glass, very nice.",1425945600,3,616,4.368421052631579

I loved Sheppard and Teyla for their tendency to follow orders ""creatively"" and Rodney's arrogance and self importance were great comic relief.

The Wraith were worthy successors to the villainy of the Goa'uld, I mean what better villains than a race of insect-human life-force vampires?",1425168000,,454,5.013333333333334

 being a sci-fi buff i keep watching hoping the episodes develop a alternate story line other than than the Wraith.

2706174,5,B000LC4ZI0,"David Hewlett deserves an Oscar for his performance in this series. His outbursts are so spontaneous and his displays of insecurity so natural that he makes all the cliff-hanger situations look real and believable. Without the dramas of Rodney McKay character that David plays, the series would be bland. There are other noteworthy points about the series. The John Shepard character is a well crafted model of modern ideals of leadership qualities: calm, deliberate assessment of each situation and the available options, yet ready to face dangers of the best option. Each episode is well written, well acted, and well produced. Well done in all.",1418860800,,647,5.171428571428572

I love space sci-fi TV shows (e.g. Stargate SG1/Atlantis/Universe, Star Trek TNG/DS9/Voyager/Enterprise, Farscape, Battlestar Galactica, etc) and I wish there were shows like these on the air right now, or coming up in the near future, but it seems like the days of action spave sci-fi TV shows with big elaborate sets and special effects are over. It seems like TV has gone down hill over the last decade with everything focused on ""reality"" television. I don't want to watch someone else's reality, I want to be swept up into a great sci-fi story. Something that makes me dream of living on another planet or space station, or continually exploring the galaxy.

I've fallen in love with the characters and their stories, and enjoy the ebb and flow of the plot - fast-paced at some points, and slower at others. What can I say?

We were looking for an alternative since all of our favorite shows are either not in production anymore or we're in off season. This show started off rocky, nothing I really cared for. After about 7 shows things changed. Maybe it was the connection between the actors or they had more money for better production. We are addicted now!

2706361,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I think this series is right up their with the best of them. I'm chronologically-challenged, but I really like space flicks. I'm sad that our nation has abandoned our space program and has given up the lead that the USA held over other nations in making the exploration of outer space a reality. As a consequence space travel and exploration such as that depicted in Stargate Atlantis is probably many generations off for qualified Americans. Perhaps Russian, Chinese, Indian and Japanese young people a generation or two down the line will be traveling the stars, while Americans will still be viewing fictional presentations such as Stargate Atlantis and wondering why their forefathers failed to do the footwork to make travel to far off places in the Universe a reality for them. But, if remains fiction for them, I suspect that watching Stargate Atlantis will still be right up there at the top for them!",1401062400,,909,4.909090909090909

In fact I never saw any of the Stargate series and now I am watching all of them. I love them. I especially love John Sheppard and Jack O'Neill.

It was an awesome show, then came along Stargate atlantis. I thought like some spin offs, it was not going to be as good. Well......truth be told I was wrong. Stargate Atlantis, has wise ass comments, fun, action, all great people. Another way to put it, as I would call it a ""well oiled machine"" of a show.

Rodney McKay's personality is better developed and he becomes more human, the Wraith have a few new tricks up their sleeves (and the Stargate team have a few of their own), Rainbow Sun takes on a new persona...all in all, a satisfying watch.  Better still, it's free with a Premium membership.",1396828800,,359,4.774193548387097

2706414,4,B000LC4ZI0,"Nice adventure science fiction action and drama.  The Wraith evil concept is good, but the story lines involving the Wraith are dark and less interesting than the fantasy of exploring new worlds and new things that only can be imagined if one were to transport to other worlds through the Stargate.

Well it would've been great if it wasn't almost always focused on Sheppard & McKay...reminded me of Mash always being focused on Hawkeye.

2706432,4,B000LC4ZI0,"I enjoyed the 1st season ... and the 2nd season is just as good.
I'm kind of disappointed that Atlantis was able to make contact with Earth, because now there's a lot more interaction between Atlantis and the SGC, which I don't enjoy.  I *really* enjoy the interactions with the Daedalus and Mitch Pileggi's reoccurring appearance!  I adore him <3

Great story.  Hard to beat the SG-1 run but off to good start.

Acting is getting better and special effects are great.

Not sure why I have to provide a specific amount of words in my review but I guess I have finally written enough for Amazon to accept my real review which this Season is better than 1 and I know the rest of the series rocks cause I watched them all already on another video provider.

Most of the story lines are great - although once in a while there's a dud. Most of the actors are top notch. Jason Momoa is hot, Joe Flanigan livens up the show. Torri Higginson is convincing as a capable leader. David Hewlett plays his character well - unfortunately,his character is annoying and we'd like less of him. Whoever plays Tayla could use some acting lessons.

Overall this is a good series, worth watching.",1389398400,,552,4.52

At first I didn't know if I'd like it, but after watching the whole set I decided in ways that it's actually BETTER than SG-1 since this Series ties right into it and continues along. There are flashbacks from this series to SG-1 at different points that makes it interesting. YES -- I'd say that this season IS just as good as the other four are and worth the money.

Also, I noticed that I kinda missed Bob Hope earlier movies and I can't help seeing ""Rodney"" in the roles that Bob Hope played in his ""Road to"" movie series. I think that ""Rodney"" and Bob Hope have very similar ways of dealing with stress. I think it would be fun to watch ""Rodney"" deal with the same raucous situations that Bob Hope dealt with in his early movie career.",1381363200,,586,4.485981308411215

2706506,1,B000LC4ZI0,"For most of the episodes in Stargate Atlantis, the story and the main characters all fall short (not even half) by comparison to Stargate SG1. By characters I mean the roles being portrayed not the skill of the Actors/Actress. The story plot is just plain ridiculous.

Colonel Shephard), Tayla, Ronan and the always funny Dr. McKay played by David Hewlet, his best performance ever I think, was as this character. This is probably rated as sci fi but has to be scifi-fantasy. Yes, they travel through a Stargate to other worlds and meet other people, which may be hopefully sci fi (wouldn't you love to be able to do that? I would) but those people speaking English is probably all fantasy. The villains, the Wraith, are wonderful fantasy too, or nightmare horror. So now we are talking scifi-fantasy-horror genre. But really they always escape and  you know they will, even though they may escape with some aftereffects. If you want some really good entertainment complete with humor, check this series out!

2706535,5,B000LC4ZI0,"One of the most delightful, engaging, and original TV series I have ever watched. While the original idea is a third generation spinoff from the 1994 movie, Stargate, the way each episode and seasonal arc is written is in no way stale or rehashed. The characters are more loveable, believable, and appealing than SG-1's military heavy characters, (not including the very attractive Daniel Jackson and the dry wit of General O'Neill).  Col. John Sheppard brings vitality, humor, and a modern day snarkiness to his role as military leader of Atlantis, and leaves this watcher eager for his next scene. And Rodney McKay is brilliant and equally annoying, yet highly addictive and as much as a joy to watch as Sheppard.  This series was cut short far too soon at just five seasons, but Season 2 remains my favorite even after all these years. Enjoy.",1376352000,,845,4.861111111111111

While I enjoyed seeing some of the characters from SGU, I got bored watching Atlantis.  It was the same old, same old story line every episode.  Every other episode was the same--the Atlantis crew were threatened by an alien race, they go after them, they win. End of episode.

Not to bad mouth other shows, they may be great but I just could never get into them. I actually started watching this show on netterflex a while back and really liked it. When I found out the show was no longer making episodes, I was really bummed out. Only because of the way the series ended. There are 5 seasons and all are great. Each episode continues the other. There is not to many episodes that stand by themselves. Its like one big story line. One long movie. I think thats where Battle Star Galactica got its premise. So this is the spin off the hugely popular Stargate 1 series, and this series rocks. It has so much action and great story lines. The actors are so good at what they do.

Stargate command is guilty of incompetence for allowing her to remain in control of that facility.

The behavior of the characters in Alantis needs improvement, I hate what they did to the one character I felt was done right but the replacement isn't bad and the actor is decent.  The problem is Alantis needs it's comedic episodes and Shaaka type episodes of Sg1 instead of the rodney character constant and insistant rants.  It makes the show predictable and dull, I do like the lead of this show.  He would have been better then Ben browder as a replacement for Oneill.

the episode itself is dumb, boring and lame.  The problem and solution are a bit far fetched, based on what's been shown it was incorrect.  Needless to say the episode could have been entertaining if the mckay character had a better actor.  I don't get the writers of this show at all.  They either do the geeks as know it all jerks or know it all fembots.  How about smart and normal for a change......just a thought.",1345248000,,921,4.461077844311378

2706696,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Of all the seasons of Stargate Atlantis, I think that by sheer numbers my favorite episodes come from season 2. However, seasons 1 and 3 also get five stars because of all five seasons, these are the only three that had close to half of the episodes being what I would call truly five-star and beyond.

While I mention in other reviews that season 3 is the peak performance for Stargate Atlantis, I would also argue that it is merely an extension of the amazing episodes that were generated out of season 2. SGA was giving a great jumping point with season 1 and season 2 took those past episodes and expanded it to make something that truly became television worth watching every week.

One of my favorite parts of the entire Stargate franchise is the character development and I thought some of the strongest was in this season. Season 3 saw great McKay-centric episodes, but season 2 saw many wonderful team-centric episodes that really helped to illustrate the bond created and forming between current and new characters on the show.

I also thought some of the best storylines came out of season 2. Epiphany, Trinity, Duet, Inferno, Grace Under Pressure and The Long Good-bye are some of my all-time favorite episodes for storyline, character development and emotional response. All five seasons of Atlantis have been worth watching. Seasons 1-3 are the best, but if I had to decide, I would say that season 2 is, in my opinion, the best that SGA had to offer.",1233878400,,1465,4.71484375

Season 2
DVD Set:
1.  The discs are great and easy to take them out.
2.  Slim type case gives extra room, not like the Buffy, Babylon 5, Lois & Clark to name a few that take a lot of space.
3.  THERE ARE SCENE SELECTIONS ON THIS SET.  Thank you for that... I hated that season 1 did not have them.
4.  All episodes come with a commmentary, excellent.. you can watch it with or without giving you double the pleasure.
5.  The menu is much better than in season one.  It is easy to read and navigate.
6.  The art on the cases and DVD is OK, nothing fancy but it does not look like a bad print like in the Beauty and the Beast series.

THE SERIES.

Like other reviewers I will agree that the cast is much better in season two.  I did not like the character played by Rainbow Sun and I still not care for Ronan.  All the other characters are great.  The deadelus and its captian are a welcomed addition to the series, giving in it a great sense of power in the pegasus galaxy.

All the episodes are great and built momentum, but the final three episodes including the finale are lacking the excitement of season one.  The final episode ends with a cliffhanger, that does not (at least to this reviewer) make you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for season three to star.  Through the season we watched conflicts within the crew, friends and enemies to be let down at the end.

It is still an excellent show, highly recommended to add to any sci fi library.  If you do not have any of the four seasons, buy them in the pack (I did), and at the time was cheaper than individually.

2706721,4,B000LC4ZI0,"The second season of Stargate Atlantis has quite a few good episodes, but one can already glimpse the storyline weaknesses that will rear their ugly heads in season 3. The characters, too, are changing, and sometimes not for the better.

Lt. Col. John Sheppard has become Jack O'Neill Jr. in this season. He cracks lame jokes, lets others do his work for him, and seems only to be good at flying planes. However, Dr. Elizabeth Weir isn't much different than before; she sometimes ends up making the wrong decision, but she's still fair. Dr. Rodney McKay begins to tread the road from crabbiness to sheer angriness; although brilliant, he seems driven to childishly ostracize everyone around him. Thus, he is very, very annoying, and due to this `conflicted' personality, the writers love giving him center stage. Teyla is still the warrior woman, however, and she offers up her wisdom now and again. Ronon is the newest member of the team; although not being very emotive, he's likeable. Dr. Carson Beckett, becoming a regular in this season, doesn't have much to do but is a very earnest character.

On to the episodes:

The Siege, Part III--7 of 10--This finished the 1st season cliffhanger somewhat well but also somewhat poorly. The spectacular ship Daedalus arrives to deal with the Wraith, but Lt. Aiden Ford is changed subtly by a Wraith, and the latter is a huge mistake. Ford was a nice, likeable, and cheerful character in season 1 and quite frankly, in this episode he becomes yet another annoying one. It puts a damper on the episode.

The Intruder--9 of 10--While traveling from the Milky Way to Pegasus, the Daedalus encountered mysterious sabotage. This is one of the better episodes--a mystery at first, which quickly turns into a race against time, helped by nicely done computer effects. We see what the main characters did as they relaxed on Earth days before, and watch while some of them cope with both personal and life-threatening problems at the same time.

Runner--7 of 10--The team meets Ronon for the first time, but has to contend with the errant Ford. The parts of the episode featuring dirty, disheveled Ronon are good; the worst part, though, is that Ford truly believes he's perfectly all right, but every member of the team insists on trying to get him to come back to Atlantis for medical treatment! Not even Teyla, wise leader of the Athosians, thinks to agree with him. Due to this, the episode feels slightly contrived. There is a very good fight scene between Ford and Ronon, however, that shows how equally the two are matched.

Duet--8 of 10--Because of their fiddling with a Wraith dart, Rodney and one Lt. Cadman become locked within one body--Rodney's. This is good because of the large amount of comedy involved--it downplays Rodney's irritating qualities. Even with his character's dislikeable tendency, David Hewlett is a very good actor who makes the most of his role, fluctuating between two distinct and different personalities.

Condemned--5 of 10--Convict day! The team falls into a bad situation as they find that a planet dumps its convicts on an island with the Stargate, so the Wraith can feed on them. The leader of the planet is the usual cowardly type, willing to sacrifice anything and everything so that he can live, whereas the convicts obviously have an insane and brilliant leader who can decipher any problems in the blink of an eye. All the guest characters are stereotypical in this way; it if weren't for such blatant unoriginality, this episode would be decent.

Trinity--5 of 10--The team finds a potentially unending source of energy, but of course it doesn't work. Not Rodney at his best...in the whole episode he's more than insufferable. Aside from being grating, he's extremely cocky and smug, insisting on doing what he shouldn't. He's also scolded for his actions, but by the next episode is back to normal. Rodney ruins the story, unfortunately, as he does many times.

Instinct--7 of 10--The team comes upon a man raising a Wraith girl as his daughter. This episode has several strong points as well as a few weak ones; it also marks the beginning of the--I'll be blunt--idiotic Wraith-turned-into-humans story arc. It is a good adventure, though. The man has a very good reason to raise a Wraith--he's not mad or foolish. The girl, too, is what could almost be called an oxymoron: a somewhat likeable Wraith!

Conversion--7 of 10--Due to his adventures in `Instinct', Sheppard begins to change, and not for the better. Most of this episode chronicles Sheppard's metamorphosis--first subtle, then more and more noticeable until it becomes almost horrifying. The trying part of this episode is Dr. Weir, who doesn't exactly make the best decisions of her career. Her foolishness, as usual, is really vexing.

Aurora--7 of 10--The team finds an Ancient warship dead in space, complete with its crew, who are in stasis but can conveniently interact; however, the Wraith are hovering nearby. As we in the audience can predict, none of the Ancient crew believe Sheppard when he pleads for them to search for a Wraith in their midst. If it weren't for the Ancients' stubbornness--they are supposed to be smarter than the average humans, right?--this episode would be over in twenty minutes, not forty-two.

The Lost Boys--6 of 10--Ford returns, this time with a bunch of tough guys at his side, and coerces the team into helping him. Ford is, of course, hyperactive, delusional, and all-around aggravating; his plans are horrible, which adds significantly to the storyline. He presents more of a villainous front than that of a wayward ally.

The Hive--7 of 10--Trapped aboard a Wraith hive ship due to Ford and his plans, the team tries desperately to escape. The Wraith worshippers--a very interesting but underutilized plot twist--are introduced in this episode, making it better than the previous one.

Epiphany--6 of 10--Sheppard makes the mistake of running through a mysterious doorway and becomes trapped in a `bubble' inhabited by Ancients. There is the standard beautiful woman and dangerous challenge waiting for him; he grows a beard that, although months pass, never becomes more than stubble! This episode is interesting but clichd.

Critical Mass--10 of 10--There is a bomb in Atlantis, placed there by the Goa'uld-infiltrated Trust (which is based on Earth), and Rodney has to figure out how to disarm it. This is the best episode of the entire season--if not the entire show--featuring a shocking twist at the end that I could not see coming by a long shot!

Grace under Pressure--5 of 10--Rodney is trapped in a sinking puddle jumper; by far, one of the most maddening episodes. The premise is sound, but Rodney spends his time ranting, raving, yelling, snapping, and being all-around horrific. To add to the chaos, Sam Carter pops up, making Rodney show the symptoms of his inane crush on her. If he's this bad here then I can only imagine how he'll be during season 4.

The Tower--4 of 10--The team stumbles on a city exactly like Atlantis, ruled by nobles whose personalities resemble Henry the 8th and his court. This episode is more funny than anything else, given the fact that it's so terrible.

The Long Goodbye--4 of 10--Sheppard and Weir become hosts to alien personalities and rampage around the city. Since the two personalities hold grudges against each other--anything else would have been boring--they are almost perfect fighters, escaping from their pursuers time and time again and making the episode very predictable. An interesting thing I noticed: Torri Higginson changes her acting style totally to fit the new character she's presented with, whereas Joe Flanigan acts...the same!

Coup D'Etat--9 of 10--Ladon of the Genii, who we last saw in `The Storm/The Eye', returns to the city, telling Weir that he plans a coup of the Genii government. With surprises galore, this episode is just as good as any with the Genii, if not better. We see just a glimpse of the convoluted political situation within their government.

Michael--5 of 10--The team begins their experiment with the Wraith-into-humans drug, which naturally results in disaster. Given the fact that the entire idea of making such a drug was imprudent, the episode logically becomes just as bad. The titular character is a classic villain--super-smart and exceptionally skillful, able to figure almost anything out in the blink of an eye.

Inferno--6 of 10--A civilization, gifted with a shield that protects them from anything, runs the shield constantly until its source of power--a volcano--starts to erupt. The basis of this episode is a very interesting idea; however, both Sheppard and Rodney act like morons around one of the native women. As they almost grow close to fighting over her, one thinks of earlier episodes that would be a much better use of one's time.

Allies--6 of 10--Michael returns, this time with a hive ship, calling for an alliance. Dr. Weir falls right into it and finds that the Wraith didn't particularly care for an alliance; in this episode, the denizens of Atlantis are tricked splendidly--only one of many times. Actually, it makes me wonder if the people of Atlantis are really Earth's best and brightest. If they get into trouble so easily, how in the world were they allowed to settle in the city?",1216684800,,9308,4.987749838813668

2706723,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I grew up watching Star Trek (as in the original series) and have always enjoyed sci-fi.  I have to admit that this series is one of the best, past or present.  The plots are well-written, the characters have a depth not usually found, the writing, (particularly the exchanges between Rodney and anyone)is first-rate and there are plenty of silly moments - enough to keep even my 7-year-old and 14-year-old entertained.  Additionally, there are almost no moments I would feel I had to skip or fast-forward through because I would consider them inappropriate for my kids.  I would highly recommend this series to any sci-fi fan.",1206403200,,627,4.942857142857143
2706724,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I honestly like this show. Even though I was not hooked to the original SG-1 (but loved the motion picture), Stargate Atlantis grew on me. The script is very well written, with lots of humor. This is intelligent writing at its best. There is chemistry between the cast, and the characters are lovable.

Season 2 begins with the third and final part of Season One's ""The Siege"". If you recall, Season 1 ended with Sheppard flying into a Wraith hive with an atomic bomb in order to save Atlantis from the Wraiths. Should the Wraiths succeed in taking over Atlantis, they would have direct access to Earth! The Daedalus, a brand-new battle cruiser commanded by Col. Steven Caldwell, saves the day. The Daedalus is able to cruise in hyperspace, and can beam people up and down, just like Star Trek. The configuration of the ship is also the same, with the captain sitting in the middle of the cockpit. Honestly, I think the producers should not have introduced the Daedalus. It is too much of a Star Trek copy-cat. They could have instead created a brand new concept in a futuristic battleship. The battleship in Battlestar Galactica, for example, does not use the same technology as in the Enterprise in Star Trek.

Ronon Dex (Jason Momoa) joins the cast of Atlantis in this season. I like his character, but doesn't he get cold being topless all of the time? You would also think he would be wearing a uniform.

I don't like episodes such as when Sheppard turns into a bug and back again, or when Elizabeth gets another consciousness in her head and almost kills everyone. I think such episodes were rushed. Can you imagine a person in real life getting transformed into a bug and back again within a period of a few days? It could be possible, but it would be more believable if it took years for the metamorphosis to take place. Obviously, such long periods are not possible in one-hour long episodes. I would rather the producers air believable episodes, not just episodes with the sole intent of entertainment.

My favorite characters are Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) and Dr. Carson Beckett (Paul McGillion). I would love to see Dr. Beckett take more principal roles.

The season ends with the ""Allies,"" where the Wraith Michael brings a Wraith Queen to Atlantis to fight against another hive. I can't wait for Season 3.",1206144000,,2326,4.705159705159705

2706739,5,B000LC4ZI0,"First of all, I have to say that I started off thinking that I would never prefer Stargate Atlantis over SG-1. After ten years of SG-1, the familiar characters we know so well, the stories and the plots which are never boring, I didn't think Atlantis could even reach, let alone surpass SG-1.

At first I didn't even really get to watch Atlantis, then one day, late at night, I watched an episode. It was 'Epiphany', in which Sheppard is transported to a bubble of space-time in which descendants of the ancients live, to study meditation and ascension. It was this episode which got me wanting to watch more, and by the time I watched 'Michael', in which a captive wraith is turned human, I was hooked. Not only does this show equal SG-1, it's even better. And the wraith are definitely my favorite 'bad guys' of the Stargate universe, far more so than the Goa'uld of SG-1, who pale in comparison, although they are funny.

After getting hooked on the Season 2 episodes, I then went ahead and bought the rest of the series. This season is in my opinion the best, although I love the first and third season as well. There's the right amount of excitement, plot, and humor. McKay, as much as I couldn't stand him in SG-1, quickly became one of my favorite characters as he bumbles his way through the series, victim to mishaps wherever he goes, yet vain and brilliant. The episodes 'The Hive' and 'The lost boys' are great examples here. And Sheppard continues to be one of my favorites, the smartassed, loyal O'Neill-type leader of his team.

There isn't a boring episode in this season, in my opinion. So far I've watched season 2 three times, and I'm still not tired of it. Amazing Sci-Fi series, I hope it stays around for a while!",1196726400,,1734,4.533546325878595

To my surprise the writing was surperb, the plot was reasonable (for a show that takes place in a galaxy far away) and the characters exceptionally likable.
It took me about 3 shows to realize that I was hooked.  I found that I was generally interested in what happened on the next show.  Interwoven with the pegasus galaxy's woes you will find wit, humor and plenty of humanity.  I was sad to find that one of the main characters left (slowly) but was replaced with a wonderful new guy.  I tend to get ovely loyal to my characters so I didn't take well at first.  The writers did a great job of winning me over with Ronan Dex who takes Ford's place on the team.  My 2 teenage boys make fun of me for being drawn in, but that's fine with me. The fact that Stargate is attached to the name gives people and idea that Atlantis is as cheesey as SG-1.  Not the case whatsoever.  When we were close to approaching the season finale of the first season I knew I had to get the second season.  I am happy to inform you that the second season is even better than the first.  I haven't watched any extra's but they are there.  My husband and I watch an episode a night.  We are 1/4 of the way through the third season and I'm not sure what kind of withdraw I'm going to experience when I have to wait for weekly episodes like the rest of the world. What I can say is that this set is worth every penny.  Enjoy the second season...we sure did.",1182816000,,1733,4.116071428571429
2706763,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Ever since they announced that Stargate SG-1 was ending its series its spin off Stargate Atlantis has grown on me. Maybe its in the same way I loved Star Trek DS9 and Star Trek Voyager in that each of these series the crew is far from home and in hostile territory without the help of earth and its defenses. But all in all this series has grasped my  attention the most because of its cast, its wonderfully acted and a good balance of drama, comedy and action. i would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves sci fi or a good quality television series.",1182124800,,552,4.3076923076923075

Throughout the course of this season, the crew of Stargate Atlantis works to overcome the obstacle of having Adama out of commission, dealing with a conflict between military rule and President Roslin's resistance, the discovery of a map to Earth on Kobol, the introduction of the Pegasus and the ensuing conflict, and the dramatic season finale which involves settling roots down on the planet New Caprica.

This show has everything that a science fiction fan can ask for.  It has a wonderful balance of characters that alternately love and hate each other, but are also there for each other in a pinch.  It also has a wonderful balance of drama, humor, angst, light moments, and issues, such as capital punishment.

Now I'm gonna have to wait until it's on DVD again.

2706803,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I've always loved space based scifi.  I'm a Trekker and a Star Wars Fan, and have adored Stargate SG-1 for years.

I truly loved the first season of Stargate Atlantis.  The stories weren't just a remake of the original series, SG-1, but something quite refreshing while still paying homage to it's roots.  And now the second season -- what the writers did with the Wraith story line just made it more interesting -- gave it more depth, -- with the addition of a ""runner"" to the cast, together with understanding the chemical process of how wraiths feed (which turns into its own storyline in ""Lost Boys"", and ending the season with the culmination as evidenced in episodes called ""Michael"" and ""Allies"", sort of starring Connor Trineer (Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker on Star Trek Enterprise).  One has to own this season with all the special features to understand why it sort of stars Mr. Trineer.  Some of the characters are getting more depth, also,.... watching them grow as people is as fun to me as the great special effects and the storyline -- including a brilliant comical performance by David Hewlitt on ""Duet"".

I've watched it twice through already and my 8-year-old daughter who's favs are Dr. Weir and Teyla, keeps requesting their playback.  And my husband, who isn't really into the whole scifi genre is really enjoying it.  Fun for the whole family.",1175817600,2,1368,4.836909871244635

Overall, the commentaries added to the viewing and didn't detract or distract.  Would have liked the Inline Video Commentaries like on the Doctor Who Series Two, so we could actually see the people while they're watching the show.  No Deleted Scenes (which is why gave this 3 stars instead of four).  Especially, missed seeing some deleted scenes referred to in the commentaries.  Overall, this is worth $30-$35 price.  Would have felt disappointed if it had cost much more.",1175817600,,709,5.267857142857143
2706817,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Without going into the details of the episodes, what I noticed the most about the second season was continued high quality and interesting story writing, although there were a few very predictable episodes, like the one where Sheppard turns into a bug and back again.  But the good news is that Stargate Atlantis has become such a character driven show that even predictable story lines are entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.

More of what I like:

Not only do we get humor with our science fiction, even an entire episode intended to be a comedy (the very funny Duet).

We get a lot of main character development, but we also have strong secondary characters (like Dr. Zelenka and Colonel Caldwell), that really give Atlantis a sense of community.

Great special features, one of my favorites being ""Road to a Dream with Martin Gero"".  Ha ha!

Commentaries with every episode!  I watch the episodes with my wife, who doesn't like Sci-Fi as a genre but is addicted to this show, and then I watch the commentaries on my little flat-panel while walking on the treadmill.  There's a lot of entertainment for the money here!

Now, the one thing I really don't like about this set are the menus.  The purpose of the menu screens, I thought, was to help me navigate through the DVD, not to demo the special effects.  In my entire DVD watching career, these are the only DVDs where I've ever had to actually get up and move close to my TV just to read the episode selections!

I did some measurements and the area devoted to the episode choices on the top menu screen is roughly 5% of the screen area.  The rest is special effect playbacks!  And, the menu selections themselves are listed using a thin, faded font that doesn't even stand out from the rest of the screen.  Blue on blue!  Brilliant!  What are these menu designers thinking?  Maybe the third season DVD menu will be in 8pt courier?

Still, it's a great show.  These episodes are like potato chips; just try to watch just one!",1175644800,10,1987,4.556497175141243

2706821,4,B000LC4ZI0,"I believe Atlantis came into existence at the right time. SG1 had done it's job at laying the ground work, for a different story line. Atlantis often is weaved into SG1 and vice versa, which in essence creates one big Stargate show. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys witty drama, interesting plot twists, and the realm of science fiction.",1175040000,,353,4.709677419354839
2706822,4,B000LC4ZI0,"Stargate Atlantis continues to map out new territory without completely losing its connection to the series that spawned it.

This seasons introduces some new characters to go along with the old ones. Most notable is Ronon Dexx who joins the team as the mostly silent, ""beat the opposition into submission"" type of personality. He plays a straight man and is good for some laughs.

The Goa'uld make their presence felt even in the Pegasus galaxy hosting Atlantis. This could provide some interesting story lines in the future but is just getting started this season.

While still darker in tone than the original, it is lighter than the first season. It is entertaining and fund to watch.

Episode synopses appear below:

The Siege Part III  - As last season closed, the cliffhanger had Atlantis under siege by the Wraiths and things were not going well. Atlantis was ready to self destruct and Maj. Shephard was on the way to a suicide mission. As is customary in such situations, the cavalry arrives just in the nick of time in the form of the Earth Ship Daedelus. It has some advanced Asgard technology on board which saves Shepherd and helps to destroy the hive ships attacking Atlantis. Some manage to get away and they are heading back with reinforcements. While the cleanup is going on, a lieutenant is rescued but he has been severely damaged by the wraith. He is irrational and jumpy about the others who do not fully trust him. As the enlarged wraith fleet arrives, Atlantis decides to gamble on deceiving them that a self destruct has really taken place. This occurs just as the damaged lieutenant steals a puddle jumper and flees through the gate.

The Intruder - The Daedelus has made a trip back to Earth to let SGC know what's going on. Shepherd has been promoted to LTC and given command of the military contingent against the wishes of the commander of the Daedelus who wanted the job for himself. As the ship heads back for Atlantis, they become aware of a Wraith computer virus which has infected the ship. The virus is intelligent and self modifying. The is actively trying to sabotage the ship, kill off those who would try to fix the problem and summon the Wraith.

Runner - A team from Atlantis is investigating a planet with extremely high solar radiation. While there, they find a dead Wraith. There is evidence that he was killed by Lt. Ford, the guy who fled in the first episode of the season. The team heads back to try and get him to come back.  They find a surprise. There is another human on the planet who has had a transmitter mounted in his back so that he can be the guest of honor in a sort of trophy hunt. He has managed to elude the Wraith for 7 years before being captured. He is set free by Lt. Ford who is deranged. Now it is a 3 way manhunt with nobody trusting anyone else.

Duet - While investigating a world, a Wraith Dart comes through and scoops up Dr. Rodney (the megalomaniac) and a female officer assigned to security. The others manage to shoot it down before it can get away and let Atlantis's secret out. Now the team is stuck with trying to figure out get them both out of the dematerializer they do not understand. They have only enough power to get one person out and Rodney is the one they get, in the hope that he will be able to help get the other out. It doesn't work out like that though. He gets out but the consciousness of the woman gets stuck in his body along with his own. Now he has a voice stuck in his head that everyone finds uncomfortable. Its also a bit amusing since she takes control while he is asleep and uses the opportunity to arrange his and her own love life to suit. An second story involves Ronon Dexx who was rescued in the last episode. His people are all dead now and Shepherd is trying to get him integrated into the community with a few social hitches.

Condemned - The Atlantis team is exploring a new planet and find something strange. At first, the locals seem like savages but, as they are being attacked, they are saved by another group of locals with advanced technology. It turns out that the area with the stargate, an island, is the local prison. The Atlantis population would like to arrange trade with the locals but they become aware of an ugly secret. The prison is successful because they prisoners are used by the Wraith for feeding. It is an easy source of food for the Wraith and keeps down the undesirables for the locals. The problem is that the Wraith have hearty appetites and even Jaywalking is a capital crime. When the exploring team is captured by convicts, everyone is working at cross purposes.

Trinity - While exploring, an Atlantis team finds evidence of a huge battle in which lots of Wraiths were destroyed. Unfortunately, the weapon did not come in time to save the Ancients. Now,  the tech guys think they can finish the development work. If it works, Atlantis will have a power source that makes the ZPM crystals look like alkaline batteries. It's dangerous and there is a reason the Ancients abandoned it.

Instinct - While investigating a new planet, the Atlantis team comes across a village that is intermittently plagued by a Wraith. The team agrees to hunt it down but finds something unexpected. They find a local ""scientist"" who has been raising a juvenile female Wraith as his daughter. He swears that it is not her who is terrorizing the village. He also maintains that there is another Wraith out there. The science types at Atlantis think they might be able to use the girl to develop a vaccine to fight the virus that causes humans to become Wraiths. It might even turn Wraiths back into humans.  The research is promising until the young Wraith girl jumps the gun causing no end of problems.

Conversion - At the close of the previous episode, LTC Shepherd was injured by the Wraith girl who had tried the experimental virus. Some of their blood mingled. Now he is infected with the parasitic virus that produces Wraiths. Now the race is one to capture an alien bug, get some stem cells and find a cure. The col. is going stir crazy while this happens and is getting more and more volatile.

Aurora - With the new power supply, Atlantis's sensors pickup indications of an Ancient ship on the other side of the galaxy. The Daedelus manages to find it and a Wraith ship at the same time. The Wraiths are driven off and the team decides to investigate the newly found technological treasure trove. When aboard, they find the complete crew in functioning stasis units and indications that their minds are active in a virtual environment. Sheppard decides to enter a pod in order to contact the crew. The problem is that the crew on the Ancient ship does not believe they are stuck in a simulation. They do not realize that 10,000 years has past. Sheppard admittedly has a fantastic story but he is having an even more difficult time than expected making himself believed. He is being sabotaged by the Wraith who have an interest in the ship.

The Lost Boys - The team is following up on a tip and is captured. They are quickly taken to another planet where they find that they have been captured by a force led by the AWOL Lt. Ford. He has been on a rampage and has been taking Wraith ""enzyme"" from all of his victims. He feeds the enzyme to his followers to give them super strength. He thinks that is the way for humanity to defeat the Wraith. The enzyme prevents him from thinking straight. And, by the way, this one is a cliffhanger.

The Hive - Lt. Ford's plan to prove the worth of the enzyme is simple. They use a stolen dart and use it to blow up a hive ship. That's what they were doing at the end of the last episode when they got captured. Remember, Ford doesn't think all that well under the influence of the enzyme. After the capture, all grow through withdrawal  from the enzyme. The longer it has been used, the worse the withdrawal. Help comes from an unexpected source from the least likely hero.

Epiphany - While looking for an Ancient treasure trove, the team finds a cave protected by some sort of barrier. Camera images from the other side show nothing dangerous and they have no trouble pulling their probe back. People are another matter. When Shepherd touches it, he is sucked in and cannot withdraw. Things get stranger when McKay realizes that time is passing much faster on the other side of the barrier. Shepherd spends his time on the wrong side of the barrier meeting the ancestors of the Ancients. It is a sanctuary for people to prepare themselves for Ascension. It is also inhabited by a monster that only Shepherd is brave enough to face.

Critical Mass - Stargate Command on Earth and Atlantis are plunged into chaos when it is revealed that a Goa'uld operative is hidden in Atlantis. The operative has orders to set a bomb to blow up Atlantis when the Stargate is used to dial Earth. They apparently want to destroy Atlantis to keep the Wraith from getting anywhere near them. The mole is very highly placed.

Grace under Pressure - McKay is on a test flight of a refurbished puddle jumper when there is a problem and it crashes into the ocean. It quickly begins to sink and faces the prospect of being crushed by the pressure as it heads down. The clock is running as Atlantis tries to find him. Does anyone remember that McKay is claustrophobic?  There is a nice cameo by LTC Sam Carter from SG1.

The Tower - The team is away visiting what seems to be a backward planet. It turns out, however, that the people they see are just the peons. The nobility live in a great tower which bears a striking resemblance to the central tower of Atlantis. In fact, it turns out to be a copy of Atlantis, complete with weapons systems. There is a strict separation between the nobility and the serfs and the latter are treated very badly. A dynastic succession controversy makes things that much worse.

The Long Goodbye - This is a confusing one. The Atlantis Team finds two derelict ships, each with a life support system. When the first is rescued, an alien consciousness takes over Dr. Weir. She says that she and her husband were ambushed. Her imprint will only last a little while and she asks that LTC. Shepherd allow himself to be imprinted as well for a final goodbye. He agrees but things go south right away. They are a couple but they are trying to kill each other. They know their way around Atlantis and they are intent on killing each other no matter what.

Coup D'Etat - The Genii are up to their old tricks. Through double dealing, they try to convince Atlantis that a coup is planned. It is all a plan to take Shepherd and some others as prisoners in exchange for some Atlantis technology. The plotters have their own plots, however, and there are coups under way. It is a convoluted plot that fits well with the Genii.

Michael - Something is not quite right. The episode begins with a man in sick bay. As he is awoken, all of the command staff is notified to be there. He has amnesia and cannot remember anything. He is told that he was a member of a team captured by the Wraith and recaptured by Atlantis. That is not quite the truth which is quite a bit uglier. He was a Wraith upon whom an experimental retrovirus had been tried. The experiment threatens the existence of Atlantis itself.

Inferno - Atlantic gets a message from a planet that is seeking help. They are having trouble with the shield left by the Ancients. It turns out that the local planet has a shield left by the Ancients and powered by a gigantic volcano. Since the locals have been running their shield on overtime, the power draw has awoken the volcano which threatens the entire planet. The evacuation just gets started when lava swallows the stargate. That means using the Daedelus to ferry people...a slow process. There is one ace in the hole. The planet has an Ancient battleship big enough to ferry everyone. Unfortunately it is not in working order. Dr. McKay is doing his best to figure it out and fix it but suspicions are slowing things down. Those suspicions are fueled by the observation that Atlantic would like to claim the ship.

Allies - A Wraith hive ship arrives. Instead of opening fire, the Wraith ship opens communication. It is being led by Michael, the Wraith upon whom experiments were conducted. He is offering all sorts of Wraith military secrets...for a price. They want the retrovirus used to create Michael. They believe that will give them supremacy over other Wraith. They are a slimy group though and hidden agendas are not beyond the realm of possibility. The alliance is not what it seems. Earth is in trouble in this season ending cliffhanger.",1174176000,13,12632,4.54221635883905

My review is on the home page of the discs.  This is an major improvement from season 1 as you can scroll down to what episode you want to watch at a viewing or you can watch them all.  They also have some action snippets and photos from the episodes on that particular disc to make the homepages more interesting.  The back drop on the discs this season is the schematic of atlantis.

2706836,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Season 2 has finally hit DVD, and it does not dissapoint.  I recently decided to start follwong this show, but I needed to start at the begining.  I bought seson one a few months ago and was very impressed.  Season two is more intense, with even better visiaul affects and more action!  I only wish that I could get all of season 3 before season 4 starts up on The Sci-Fi channel next month.  I unfortunately will be a little out of sync watching this new season, but it's a wonderful show.

Now I never got into the SG1 series, so I can't evaluate this show from that angle, but I do remember the origal Kurt Russell Stargate movies from the 90's; those are enough to make sense out of this show.  If you like the ""new school"" Battlestar Galactica that's on the sci-fi chanel now, I think you'd enjoy this.  Battlestar Galactica is more dramatic while Stargate Atlantis is more adventurous, so the 2 shwos are good to compare and contrast.  This certainly matches Battlestar Galactica in my opinion.

2706837,5,B000LC4ZI0,"I spent the weekend listening to the commentaries on all 20 (!) of the episodes and even watching the featurettes (well, most of them) all the way through. There are, alas, no bloopers no deleted scenes, but, as with the first season, the Atlantis audio extras belong to that rare category of commentaries that actually tell you interesting things.

For those who don't have the episodes memorized, we start with the third episode in ""The Siege"" trilogy, when Ford has fallen into the water with a Wraith drone attached to his chest, Sheppard flying into a Wraith hive with a nuke in his puddlejumper, and all of Atlantis about to fall into enemy hands.

During the season, we get to meet (and grow to like) the new member of SA-1, Specialist Ronon Dex, who's spent the last seven years running as a sort of sport-prey from the Wraith. Poor Rodney gets stuck in the back of a sinking puddlejumper and hallucinates Samantha Carter. Tayla sings over the body of her grandmother. Elizabeth gets another consciousness in her head and almost kills everyone, and Carson Beckett comes up with a Wraith nano-virus that creates Michael the Wraith and almost turns Sheppard into a bug.

Pretty cool.

The season ends with the cliffhanger ""Allies,"" where Michael brings a Wraith Queen to Atlantis to fight against another hive. Despite the ever-present threat of the Wraith, Atlantis has managed to remake the Stargate magic in its own cauldron precisely by not having too much reliance on the Big Bad Plot Arc. While SG-1 has unfortunately been mired down through seasons nine and ten with the Ori, Atlantis has gone back to the fun of SG-1's first seasons, which the teams went through the gate to adventure and romance.

So we also get to hang out with foppish ""nobles"" who use an Ancient tower to lord over the peasants, criminals who are sent to ""Wraith Island"" instead of prison, Ancients in a VR who don't know they've been in stasis 10,000 years, and nice guys who don't realize that when your Ancient shield is powered by a volcano, you really shouldn't leave it set to ""high.""

As I said, all the episodes have commentary, the best coming from Martins Wood and Gero, David Hewlett, and Peter DeLuise (though it's all fun, really, and they bring in Amanda Tapping for ""Grace Under Pressure""). We get a great featurette on James ""Bam-Bam"" Bamford, the stunt coordinator, and we spend a loooooottt of time on the kiss in McKay and Beckett character profiles.

What's really great about Wood and Gero is that their commentaries are 40-minute lessons in filmmaking. We get to hear about the DoP's lighting choices, 100 ways to make the same corridor look like different corridors, how blocking works, how the actors contribute to their characters, and how the whole thing really works.

My only complaint, and I have to reach for it, is the sucky cover art. Get someone better with Photoshop next time, guys!",1173139200,9,2902,4.778443113772455
2706838,5,B000LC4ZI0,"Let me be perfectly frank. I love this show & by loving any show, the person who loves it can see nothing wrong with it, even when there's a lot of stupid things going down on it.

But - lemme ALSO be the exception to that rule. For starters, anyone who's anyone has seen SG-1 in some way shape or form & knows that there's a set person-formula in the proceedings. (On SG-1, the count was 1 alien, 2 military, & 1 civilian.)

So - let me the first to say that I thought that would continue on with SGA. And for a time it did...only the alien was of the opposite gender & both military counterparts were guys (which effectively eschewed any kind of jack/sam-like relationships). And I'm actually glad. 'Cuz if I had wanted a carbon copy of SG-1, I'd simply turn around and WATCH SG-1. ;)

But - I'm REALLY REALLY glad when they shook things up even further in this 2nd season, with the addition of Ronon & removal of Ford. This is the move hat finally set SGA & SG-1 apart. It put a different spin on John, the main character, as well as the main team, as he no longer technically had complete control over them, since none of them had Earth-rank that he could supersede. From here on out, it would no longer be SG-1 Lite. It would be a show of its own.

And while the road may have been at times bumpy & uneven (the almost complete lack of a continual arc leading up to the finale springs to mind), it was overall an excellent sophomore season.

And it only got EVEN BETTER with Season 3!!! :) BRING IT ON! :)

2706839,5,B000LC4ZI0,"The second season is GREAT!  There is the positive addition of the character ""Ronon Dex"".  He keeps things interesting, plus for the gals, he's easy on the eyes.  There are also appearances by Richard Dean Anderson, or as we Stargate Fans know him, Brigadeer General Jack O'Neill, (that's 2 L's not one).

Plenty of action and fun!  Rachel Lutrell is not only a great actress, she is beautiful, a strong warrior and has been the voice of conscience for the team.

If you're a Stargate Fan, you must own it!!!",1171065600,3,508,4.588888888888889
2706840,5,B000LC4ZI0,fans of SG1 would also love Atlantis some new twist to the new series. The one character i do not like on the atlantis team is the paranoid scientist.,1170720000,,150,4.206896551724138
2706841,2,B000LC4ZI0,"I've been a big fan of the franchise going back to the original movie, and SG-1 has been one of my all-time favorite shows. Season 1 of Atlantis was very good with loads of promise leading into season 2. SG-1 seemed positioned to go downhill but I still had high hopes for Atlantis. Sadly Season 2 of Atlantis is better off largely forgotten, and likely the worst season of any Stargate show.

We get to see the show give up on one of its main cast members (Ford) due to their own inability to write for him. We get to see the introduction of the one dimensional alien Ronon (thank God they learned from their mistakes regarding this character in season 3 and actually decided to give him some character development), all while the character Teyla is reduced to the token women who gets all the lines which don't obviously go to Sheppard or McCay.

The majority of the episode plots revolve around the team, typically Weir, making stupid mistakes like allowing alien entities to take control of their bodies (because we're nice like that), or how about turning a Wraith into a human and letting him walk around the city, pretending he's like everyone else? Oh, and I don't even want to get in to how gullible they get when the Wraith come around saying that they 'wana start playing nice.' (This is a problem that still occationally plagues them in season 3)

Bottom line, Atlantis season 2 is nothing more than going through the motions of creating a SciFi show. There is no character development all season, unless you want to get into learning just how naive our 'political negotiations expert' leader is. There are no ground breaking discoveries and no new found allies - the kind of stuff that filled early SG-1 and that made it so good. Season 2 was simply midless filler from a show that has proven in the past that it can do much better. It's good to see that the shows creators addressed these short comings in season 3, which has been pretty good so far.",1169424000,23,1964,4.5423728813559325
2706842,4,B000LC4ZI0,"another great season, so whos the reason because the spanish lenguaje its not include? only french!, here in latin america a lot of people see star gate on fox and universal channel.",1168646400,4,182,4.71875
2706843,4,B000LC4ZI0,"I've been a fan of Stargate SG-1 since they started showing it in syndication.  (Never got Showtime)  Have all the seasons on DVD (1-9) and the first season of Atlantis.  First-off, I'd like to say any ""TRUE FAN"" of the Stargate series' would still be a fan, even through the changes.  Namely I'm referring to SG-1 and the start of season 9.  I miss Richard Anderson as Jack O'Neill as much as any other fan, but even though the changes aren't easy to get past, you can if you're a true fan.  (Ben Browder as the new add on is GREAT, not to mention Beau Bridges as the new commander!)

Anyway, on to Atlantis.  The first season of Atlantis was superb!  The cliffhanger at the end was the best I've seen for any show.  (Dare I say, better than the first season cliffhanger for SG-1?)  That being said, the show is pretty good, but not perfect.  The big one being for season 2, they didn't really give Ford's character a good chance before replacing him with Ronon.  (Not that I dislike Ronon, but they already had an alien on their team)  The problem I have when people bad mouth and peck away at the show is how they point out the way that when they're in some impossible situation, at the last moment, they get out of it using some other equally as impossible plan!  Well duh!  That's one of the main devices for the Stargate shows!  If you don't like it, you shouldn't be watching the show!  I hate it when people say, ""Oh yeah, that would work!"" or something as equally stupid.  So, you find that detonating a nuclear warhead above Atlantis, then cloaking it using a combination of the city sheild and a cloaking unit from a jumper to make the Wraith believe the city was destroyed is a cop out, impossible and too convenient situation; but actually being in a distant galaxy, aliens everywhere, and the Stargate itself isn't???  Get my point?!

There are few wrongs in the show, some believing it's one thing, but others not seeing it at all.  The only other thing that I think they should do with the show is pace themselves a little more, like they did in SG-1.  But I suppose since this is a spin-off and they have more knowledge of the universe already, they don't have to take it quite as slow.

For the fans, it is about time they released the second season!  It should have been released in November, but supposedly they had some trouble getting all the special features together.  It should be well worth the wait!",1167955200,20,2426,4.4198645598194135
