6936337,4,B00RWUOEZ8,"If you want lots of special effects, violence, etc. this is not for you. I, on the other hand, found it a refreshing change of pace to watch a film that actually tells a story (I didn't like the ending but that's just me). I thought it was an interesting storyline and the characters looked like actual people!",1429228800,,310,4.362068965517241
6936338,1,B00RWUOEZ8,"Ouch! Boring!  (Spoilers!)
This movie is a dud, you could take a nap during this movie and not miss a thing! I had expected some thing along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy, or Jupiter Ascending, but not even close!  When I go to see a movie, I expect to have at least some slight revelations about the main character. In this case, where has this guy been?, AND more importantly WHAT happened to him? This movie draws a blank on those subjects. leaving YOU to fantasize about what MIGHT have happened to him! Wonderful! I was very disappointed, Especially after watching the mysterious trailer, and getting all worked up about another interpretation of ET!  I came away from this movie saying, but where were the EBES?

Imagine if you went to see a Superman movie, but in the movie they never reveal that Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same. In short they imply through subtle hints that there might be a connection to Clark and the man of steel. I would tire very quickly of that type of nonsensical lead me by the nose-endlessly-routine. What would be the point?

 I came away from this movie knowing just about as much as I knew before I saw the movie!!

I thought that the actors were good, given the poor script and plot-line(?)  that there was. I do not fault them, but the director, and script writers!! It COULD have been SO much better! Thumbs down!  1 out of 10!",1429056000,5,1387,4.450592885375494
6936339,5,B00RWUOEZ8,"This film holds your interest, leaves you wondering what actually happened with Aaron. Plus it has some of the most beautiful scenery  showing Michigan fall colors.  Suspenseful, mysterious and compassion all thruout this movie.",1428969600,,228,5.676470588235294

6936345,2,B00RWUOEZ8,It dawns on me this younger generation of film makes do not know how to end a movie.  The premise was interesting and just when I though something might explain something.....bam the thing was over.  Now I feel like I wasted my last hour plus.......and I have watched some Gosh awful movies I can tell you that at least ended.  Geesh get some ideas kiddies.  Movies should have a beginning ..... a middle.....and an ending.,1480550400,2,423,4.6

6936347,1,B00RWUOEZ8,"The movie had a good start and it seemed to be climaxing to a good finish, but it didn't. Poorly produced and poor acting.",1479859200,,122,4.125
6936348,1,B00RWUOEZ8,"I watched this on Amazon prime because of the high rating it got there... without noticing that the IMDB rating was a very low 3.5/10! These 5 star reviews may be from the crew that made this movie. It started out very well but then fell apart. Poorly written and executed. Uneven quality. Script was not well thought out. Ending not as clear as it should have been. Some of the actors, like Michael Walton, were excellent while others were not so good. Some scenes look like they were filmed by children while others were okay. Audio was good in some scenes while others were muddy. Overall impression was they were amateurs making a movie. But they are not. They ARE professionals! Maybe they were limited by time and money to do this right.",1479772800,,743,4.552238805970149
6936349,5,B00RWUOEZ8,"This movie was amazing! Not a horror, by any means, more of a drama; but it's beautiful and the acting is phenomenal! There's suspense and adrenaline towards the end, but still much more of a drama. Loved this movie! Please don't overlook this gem!",1479600000,,248,4.659090909090909

6936351,5,B00RWUOEZ8,One of the best movies I have seen in long time. An actual storyline that touches the heart and actors that can act. One of the great things about movies is that the really good ones take you there-I forget about everything else except what is going to happen next. Give the director an A+. Brilliant.,1479513600,,301,4.392857142857143

It was pretty slow and I could be wrong, but it seems that the guy came back only because his loved ones hadn't completely accepted his death (oh wait, so why did he wake up at end). So freaking confused and lost.",1479340800,,256,4.14
6936354,4,B00RWUOEZ8,"I really enjoyed this quiet, touching mystery. For me, it had just the right mix of suspense and supernatural, it was what wasn't said that said so much. Well done!",1479081600,,164,4.5

6936363,3,B00RWUOEZ8,"I am giving this move 3 stars, provisionally. (Possible 'spoiler alert' here)... A lot of thought went into the concept and production as a lower-budget film. In other words, I appreciate the artistry behind it all. A number of comments mention ""incomplete"" and ""what happened?!"" I am guessing that the writers/editors/etc. wanted to emphasize Aaron's experience with his 'earthly' connexions under the circumstances. However, on the flip side of all that I really would like to have known what REALLY happened to him. At least the last 20 seconds of the film? Thanks.",1477872000,,568,5.118279569892473
6936364,5,B00RWUOEZ8,"""LUCY""

This is not a sit on the edge of your seat alien movie. As a matter of fact it is more of a subtle love lost and then found love story. It is a bit slow to start but it was worth watching. I won't give any spoilers away and as others have said, the ending leaves you with more questions then answers. However, if you put your mind to it, you can figure the ending out on your own. If you have some time to kill, this is not a bad movie!",1477526400,,444,3.723404255319149
6936365,3,B00RWUOEZ8,"The movie was pretty good until it got near the end otherwise I would have given it more stars.  It seemed like something was cut from the final product because the ending didn't make much sense unless we're supposed to believe the story starts all over again.  There was also no explanation for the strange glow or who those other people were trying to go after Aaron.  Like I said, something is missing.",1476576000,,405,4.52054794520548

6936367,1,B00RWUOEZ8,"This movie started off okay, but then it was really bad. Spoilers ahead.......... We never ever find out where he was all of that time.  We never find out how he was taken or where he was taken to.  We never find out who is watching him and why people are trying to track him. We never find out why he is bleeding.  We never find out what the ""blood"" on the leaves mean.  We never find out anything!!!!!  Why did I watch this?  I will never know!!!!",1475798400,6,449,4.045454545454546

6936369,1,B00RWUOEZ8,"What a snoozefest!!!!! My first admission is I wanted to like it, my second admission is that I made it for 32 minutes before turning it off and I will never try it again! The main character who ""comes back"" or whatever happens to him does not say a word in my 32 minutes. I don't know where he came from or why he appeared 20 years later after getting lost in the Gulf War. AND I don't care at all. There is a limit to how long I will wait for a story to get interesting. I think this never would have.",1433808000,5,503,3.8932038834951457
6936370,5,B00RWUOEZ8,"imagine losing someone close to you and not knowing what happened to them. Imagine losing a lover, a brother, a friend and two decades go by. And one day he shows up completely unannounced. And appears not one day older. What ensues is The Mourning. Watch it for the story.",1429315200,,273,4.48
8696195,5,B00RWUOEZ8,"One of the reasons I loved this movie is that it makes the viewer think.  The main character, Aaron, returned after twenty years. Viewer didn't need a road map to know where he had been.  Instead, the director focused on unfulfilled relationships and living with the choices. This movie reminded me of the old radio days, when you let your imagination do the work.
The only thing I would have liked more was, when the solo was sung, I would have either liked some of the words to be more clear or to be able to look them up on line. I would have bought the song had I been able to find it.  Great job.",1507420800,,601,4.163793103448276

8696200,3,B00RWUOEZ8,"It's was ok, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it (included in Prime Video). Overall I thought the acting/production was good, it was the story line that needs something.  The writer(s) may have wanted to leave something to the viewers' imagination, however there was too much left out.",1482278400,,281,4.73469387755102
8696201,2,B00RWUOEZ8,"No Payoff at the end of a very long, amateurishly acted, and horribly-recorded movie.
Seriously, worst sound I've ever heard in a film.
This looked promising, but nothing was explained and it felt like a lame SyFy network movie. Why there are any five star ratings here is beyond me.",1482105600,,283,4.68
8696202,2,B00RWUOEZ8,There were many questions to be answered as the movie progressed.  Virtually none were.  The idea of the movie was good.  The acting was poor.  A dwarf looking man was supposed to be a marine.  I don't think so unless his uniform was purchased in the boys section of a department store. Try getting a real man who can actually act.,1481846400,,331,4.360655737704918
