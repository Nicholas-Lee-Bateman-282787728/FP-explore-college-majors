Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey provide a comfortable comedic  atmosphere. Capable of being watched without fear of becoming obsolete, The  Ref will brighten any viewer's day.",956102400,,320,4.981132075471698
582952,5,6303153348,"...like never before, buy this movie!  Dennis is at his best when he's not restrained and allowed to let his mouth run as foul as it can. He's actually a great actor, but he's never been allowed to sit in the driver's  seat aside from this movie. Many kudos to Kevin Spacey for playing the  prissy uptight married guy to Leary's completely unrestrained single  thieving scoundrel. All in all, a very excellent dark comedy. ""Mary - gag  your Gramma."" One of the best lines I've ever heard! One I'll watch again  and again! I'll even purchase it again, if/when it's released on DVD (hint,  hint...)",952646400,2,596,4.619047619047619
582953,5,6303153348,"Possibly the best, most intelligent comedy of the 90's. Due to poor distribution, this film didn't see it's proper success. Spacey and Davis could EASILY have earned academy nominations for their acerbic, wry  portrayal of a dysfunctional suburbian family. A foreshadowing of Spacey's  role in American Beauty, this was a true showcase for his talents. Leary et  al were equally as superb!  I recommend this movie as one of my favorite  comedies of all time. The scene between BD Wong and Davis/Spacey in the  beginning is true cinematic genius!",951091200,4,545,5.067415730337078
582954,5,6303153348,"I've seen a lot of comedies, most of them good, but The Ref ranks right up there with Caddyshack as the two best comedies I have ever seen.  The Ref's script is intelligently written and original and the movie is casted  perfectly.  If you ever read a negative review of this film, ignore it.  That person must have a sense of humor as thin as Calista Flockhart.  This  movie is a sure thing.  Now if only they would put this film out on DVD!",945216000,3,442,4.190476190476191
582955,5,6303153348,"Outstanding! Very few comedies are able to surprise me with laughs. Most movies you see the jokes coming 3 minutes before they arrive.
Spacey & Leary are an outstanding duo. Spacey demonstrates his sharp tongued  ""Swimming With Sharks"" humor once again. Leary is, well, himself!  I would love to see another movie pitting Leary & Spacey as  antagonists!",944956800,2,353,5.051724137931035

Everyone knows how great an actor he is, so I don't have to go into that.  I think  it would be fun to see him in more comedies; it suits him also.  Denis  Leary was very good; in fact, the entire cast was.  If you want to have a  good laugh and enjoy yourself, purchase this VHS!",931996800,,413,4.1265822784810124
582957,5,6303153348,"The first time I saw ""The Ref"" I couldn't stop laughing.  The second time I saw it I laughed even more.  The third time I saw was when I laughed the most.  Get the picture?  With the great permormance by Dennis  Leary made the movie great. Everyone else in it, Kevin Spacey, Judy Davis,  Christine Buranski, and Glynis Johns, gave the performances of their lives.  Every line in the movie was histerrical.  The timing of the cast members  was incredible.  If you are looking for a movie to enjoy this Christmas,  ""The Ref"" is the best one I can recommend you(and that's coming  from someone who watches movies all the time).",914025600,2,624,4.5225225225225225

This exercise in suburban wish fulfillment reminded me of a funnier version of the vastly overrated ""American Beauty"" which coincidently also starred Kevin Spacey (Hisss! Boo!).  These aren't so much characters but caricatures disappointing when you consider the talent involved.  The only actor that transcends that label is Denis Leary as Gus the Burglar.

583488,4,6303153348,"""The Ref"" is an unlikely Christmas movie to watch any time of year. Two time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey and Emmy winner Judy Davis played Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur, a couple on the verge of divorce. They spend a part of their Christmas Eve with their marriage counselor, Dr. Wong's office. On the way home, Caroline stops at a convenience store where Gus (Denis Leary) kidnaps her and her husband. Gus and his partner, Murray, have just robbed the place and are on the run for the Christmas holidays.

Lloyd and Caroline live in Lloyd's mother's home and runs an antique store in a small Connecticut town. While the police are looking for the robbers, Gus stays at the Chasseur home in probably a memorable Christmas Eve night. Lloyd and Caroline have guests coming to their home for a traditional Christmas Eve holiday. Christine Baranski is memorable as sister-in-law Connie. Glynis Johns is terrific as Rose, the family matriarch. Glynis's Rose is a world away from Mrs. Banks in the ""Mary Poppins"" classic.

Despite everything going on, this ninety minute film is truly entertaining by a terrific cast and smart writing. I would have preferred less vulgarity with the language though. There are no special features on the DVD sadly.",1484611200,,1245,4.895734597156398
583489,5,6303153348,This irrelevant holiday movie has now become an annual tradition.  There are Christmas movies for kids but this one is for after the kids go to bed.  Dennis' character is supposed to be a bad guy but I root for him every time I watch the movie.,1484524800,,244,4.170212765957447
583490,4,6303153348,"Ok, so the basis of this movie is a tad generic:  grab a popular comedian and create a movie to throw him/her into where he/she has a chance to ramble on in a way that their fans will enjoy.  In this case, we wind up with Denis Leary as a good natured (but very angry) thief who winds up taking a highly dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas.  Over the course of the evening, Leary's angry rants reunite the family and they in turn help him . . . with whatever his main goal was, I don't remember right now.

What I do remember, however, is that this movie is one of the few that managed to break from the mediocrity of the formula and wound up being truly hilarious.  Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis playing the parents in the hostage family definitely helped (honestly, the whole cast is really good) in that they are both talented both in general and in a comedic sense, but what really sets this movie apart is Leary.  It definitely feels like he got the chance to improvise some of his rants and if he didn't it just means that the writers involved actually took the time to write dialogue that would fit their actor (of course, it does help that Denis Leary is a pretty solid actor in his own right).

I remember it not doing well when it first came out.  Some people claimed it was too dark or too fowl, but honestly it's pretty mild compared to some recent stuff.  Personally I just think it was poorly advertised.",1484179200,,1422,4.315789473684211

583666,4,6303153348,Call me crazy but I believe this movie would have earned 5 stars without Dennis Leary and whomever plays the annoying Jason. They could have made this movie really great with just Spacey and Davis airing out their dirty laundry over Christmas dinner but instead they added the highly improbable Leary character who does nothing but interrupt the true plot. As bad as Leary is the kid is the worst. And the ending was way too sappy. Not to say there aren't some truly great one liners and arguments in this movie-its why I bought it. Christine Baranski plays a perfect mother who is the type of woman who smiles at you and then stabs you in the back.,1474329600,,649,4.46218487394958

Judy Davis is hilarious and anytime Christine Baranski is on screen, you know she will be great.  It's not your typical sappy Christmas movie (which I love too), but rather it is full of sarcasm and wit.  There is some strong language in it, so just be warned if that type of stuff bothers you.

583955,5,6303153348,"It's that time of year again and when I pulled out the Christmas movies this was the first one I wanted to watch. I think this is probably my favorite Christmas movie of all time, and even though I've seen it so many times I can practically recite it, it's still hilarious.

The synopsis is pretty simple - Gus, a washed-up cat burglar (Leary), gets into a snafu when he attempts to rob a wealthy house in a small town in Connecticut on Christmas Eve. He ends up on the run from the police, and in desperation kidnaps what he thinks is an average suburban couple - Caroline and Lloyd (Davis & Spacey) - and forces them to take him to their house while he figures out what to do next. Caroline and Lloyd are, of course, as dysfunctional as they come - on the brink of divorce and deliciously nasty to one another. And, since it's Christmas Eve, the in-laws are coming to dinner - hostage situation or not. It's family dysfunction at it's best, and anyone who has EVER suffered through tense family dinners, dreaded holiday get-togethers, or had the mother-in-law from hell can probably relate to this movie.

I'm sure I'm dating myself my saying this, but I remember Denis Leary's early stand-up days and I always thought he was funny. There's something about that sarcastic wit combined with angry rants that just leaves you howling with laughter. Add Kevin Spacey (pure genius), Judy Davis, Christine Baranski (Sheldon's hilarious mother on Big Bang), and Glynis Johns and you have the makings of one the sharpest, funniest movies I've ever seen.

No, this is NOT a family-friendly Christmas movie. This one is purely for the grown-up table - and a table with more than a few empty wine bottles at that. The humor is very dark, the characters are very sarcastic, and the dialogue is sharp, biting, and liberally laced with profanity. You'll know in the first five minutes whether or not you'll like this movie with Caroline and Lloyd's marriage counseling session - I'd quote my favorite lines but none of it would make it past the sensors, lol.

But underneath all the sniping is a VERY heartwarming movie about the best and the worst parts of the most important thing of all...family. There's a delightful twist to the end (which you will see coming a mile away), and I swear this movie fills me with more Christmas spirit than Miracle on 34th Street and the Muppet's Christmas Carol combined.

Love, love, LOVE this movie. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes dark humor, can relate to dysfunctional families, and gets a kick out of Christmas movies like Scrooged and Christmas Vacation.

**NOTE about the DVD - it's a terrible transfer, and the newer your TV the worse it's probably going to look. For some reason the ""widescreen"" doesn't fit the TV screen (tried it on three different TVs and it was the same on all of them). It's stretched across the screen with black bars at the top and bottom. The only way to make it ""fit"" is to zoom it, which makes it even blurrier. I wish there was a decent transfer available, or better yet a Blu-Ray copy, but this movie is SO GOOD that I'm happy to take what I can get. The picture may be strange, but it's better than not having it at all. I can't imagine my Christmas without ""Excuse me, excuse me, EXCUSE ME!! If you don't mind, the corpse STILL has the floor!"" lol!",1450137600,6,3322,4.565436241610739

583985,2,6303153348,"As many others have already recounted, this is an outstanding Christmas comedy with fine acting by Denis Leary, Kevin Spacey, Judy Davis, and Glynis Johns.  Instead of focusing entirely on the potentially zany premise -- a burglar on the run after a Christmas-time heist -- the makers of this excellent film added a significant helping of dark comedy concerning the troubles of the family with whom the burglar hides out in well-to-do suburban Connecticut.  Instead of just a zany comedy, it's a story with real depth -- but always very funny.

But this DVD doesn't do the movie credit.  Because Disney made the unfortunate decision not to issue the DVD in anamorphic widescreen, there's no way to play it properly in full-screen mode on a widescreen TV.  You either have to choose playing it in 4:3 mode, which utilizes only the center of a widescreen TV, or in one of the ""zoom"" modes, which distort the picture while filling the screen.  I give this DVD two stars instead of one star only because Disney at least didn't release an even lamer ""pan-and-scan"" version.

This great movie deserves a much better release, preferably on Blu-ray.",1448841600,,1141,4.850515463917525

583988,4,6303153348,"""The Ref"" is a 1994 comedy-drama that stars Denis Leary, Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis. The plot centers around a bickering couple (Spacey & Davis) who are taken hostage by a robber named Gus (Leary) after running into him at the grocery store. Trapped with the bickering couple Gus' night is about to take a turn for the worst when his hostages have a Christmas Eve dinner with constant arguing and bickering. Gus finds himself being the referee for this dysfunctional family.

This movie at times is funny and also depressing. How it flopped at the box office is beyond me?

Onto the DVD.
The picture quality is troubling compression artifacts. While the 1.85:1 aspect ratio is preserved Buena Vista has failed to provide an anamorphic transfer. It's obviously a LaserDisc transfer like many other catalog titles from the company.
A major lack of bonus content here not even a theatrical trailer.

Where's the audio commentary, a behind the scenes featurette and there's a lack of subtitles.

""The Ref"" is far from being a decent DVD release. The picture quality is poor but the audio is great. It is stilll an overall mediocre DVD release and Disney isn't looking to release a Blu-Ray or HD master anytime soon. If you must own it then go ahead and purchase this DVD. If you don't want to spend a lot of money I suggest you rent it.",1448582400,,1333,4.659574468085107

The two of them somehow manage to steal the movie from Leary and have some of the funniest lines as they snipe at each other. And then when their crazy relatives show up for Christmas, Leary really has his hands full!

THE REF: You've heard of ""psychodrama."" Welcome to ""psychodramedy."" This savage psycho-satire is a Christmas card drawn jointly by Currier & Ives and Hieronymous Bosch; a venomous, vituperative comedy with sharply filed fangs. Spacey and Davis are the dynamic duo of dysfunction, and couldn't get along if their lives depended on it--literally. He's a smug, priggish mama's boy who's given up on life; she's a ""nasty, selfish woman"" (much like Lloyd's mother!) unconscious of her own artsy pretentions to ""good taste."" Even pitted against such accomplished character actors, rasty-nasty Leary holds his own, brusque and bitter against their buttonpushing, bickering and backbiting. The irony is that everyone hates his own miserable life and envies everyone else's--and the one with the worst life among them might be the only one with his head screwed on straight enough to give the others a healthy dose of ""reality therapy."" A stimulating, refreshing farce, strong on dialog, character and in-your-face comic animosity.",1422230400,,1281,5.158653846153846

584733,5,6303153348,"Every so often one of my JayFlix.net colleagues suggests a movie. This time the colleague insisted, so I watched it. I have never been disappointed when I get a referral this way and this time certainly is no exception.

This hysterical R-rated comedy boasts a wonderful director, Ted Demme (""Beautiful Girls"") and a razor-sharp script based on the story by Marie Weiss (""The Christmas List""). I defy you to find a better cast!

They are:
  * Denis Leary (""Draft Day"") Gus is a cat burgler who is cornered into taking his victims hostage. Problem is, it's Christmas and they have dinner guests due to arrive. And that is only for starters!
  * Kevin Spacey (""House of Cards"") Lloyd is the exasperated husband who NEVER gets anything right, no matter what he does.
  * Judy Davis (""To Rome With Love"") Caroline has put up with Lloyd for many years but she just can't make up her mind when to pull the plug. Besides, holidays are stressful, AND her in-laws hate her, AND her son's in trouble.
  * Robert J. Steinmiller, Jr (""Coyote"") Jesse, like children everywhere, is the lightening rod for his parents' marital problems. But he's blackmailing that guy at school, so he has running-away money on hand!
  * Christine Baranski (""The Good Wife"") Connie has been sharpening her tongue along with her nails. She's ready for anything...she thinks...
  * Glynis Johns (""While You Were Sleeping"") Grandma Rose objects to the R-rated language she hears!

This is only part of the cast, we also have more in-laws, a pair of befuddled policemen and Gus's hapless partner-in-crime who is supposed to be providing a getaway car.

You will not believe all the twists and turns (Gus listens to the bickering couple and realizes they sound like his own parents so he REALLY feels sorry for that boy). Despite the gaily wrapped Christmas gifts and elegant decorations that surround them, it still isn't surprising that the Spirit of Christmas is sorely lacking, even though Johnny Mathis sings so beautifully.

584739,4,6303153348,"""The Ref"" is one of the humorous Christmas films. It us so far fetched, you will forget your troubles and woes, and fall right into step. Dennis Leary stars as Gus, a jewel thief who sets off an alarm in a private house and then in desperation kidnaps a married couple, Judy Davis as Caroline and Kevin Spacey as Lloyd. Gus knows not what he has done on this Christmas Eve.

Caroline and Lloyd, are the personification of dysfunction. They have been fighting for years, and their son, Jesse, so fraught with their home, goes to miliItary school, and then blackmails his teachers. Gus trying to find a way out if the mess he is in, tries to mediate the couples arguments, and when their family comes for Christmas Eve dinner, all is set in motion. This is in fact a funny film, that will have you laughing. The other actors are superb. The relatives who are all as crazy as this couple, the police department filled with goons, and the neighborhood Santa Claus who drinks too much. Something for everyone, here.

Great writing and acting, a script that is full of life, and the director, Ted Demme, lets it all roll. One of the good ones at Christmas.

Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and does a bang up job as a much put upon husband in an unhappy marriage.  The couple fighting in front of the kidnapper (Leary) is absolutely hilarious and Leary handles it very well - never quite sure what to make of it.

Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis!  He takes them home where relatives are expected to arrive any minute. Karan Baranski not a well known name but google her and you will recognize the types of roles she plays stars as the sister In law and old time movie star Glyins Johns with a distinctive voice stars as the mother/mother in law.

Some comedies get serious 2/3 of the way through or they go into some romantic area - I suppose to please the romantics in the crowd - and that always seems out of sync with the whole idea of the movie - silliness.  But this picture never strays.  It's consistently funny and the timing is perfect.  Timing is critical to comedies and all the actors have that important sense of timing.  I did not see this when it first came out, but after I rented it from Netflix I had to have it just to watch every Christmas and whenever I wanted to sit and laugh.",1389398400,,671,4.203125

This is not a movie for everyone, but it is absolutely hilarious - particularly during the Holidays.  Let's face it, we all have that strange aunt or uncle or relative that always shows up at our house during the holidays - this is the movie that makes you appreciate all of them.  The chemistry and comedic timing between ALL of the cast members is excellent.

585019,5,6303153348,"Not really safe for children in my opinion, but this is one of our favorite XMas films to curl up with after the kiddo's have gone to bed.  It's hard to believe it's been out as long as it has, but Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary look so young.  Where does the time go.

To get you up to speed with a brief overview, Denis Leary is a thief who has a botched job and alarms go off in the cops are summoned.  His ride takes off and he is left to cool his jets after hijacking Spacey and Judy Davis at the store.  Spacey and Davis have an extremely dysfunctional family and the rest of the clan is descending upon them for Christmas Eve dinner.  Leary must survive the evening and avoid the police while waiting for his partner to call with a getaway vehicle.

Seriously, if you are a fan of Kevin Spacey or any of Denis Leary's stand up material you will be a perfect candidate to fall in love with this Christmas classic.  If you're offended by strong language, pass this title by.  For $10 it was a no brainer to add to our streaming collection here on Amazon.",1387843200,2,1057,4.167487684729064

This is a definite must for your holiday movie collection. But be aware, it's not for kids.  Some of the subject matter and the language is for adults only.",1387670400,,441,4.27710843373494

At the heart of this weird fable lies a warm holiday heart that gets to the essence of humanity and the Christmas season with a lot more honesty and integrity than do 90% of the holiday crappers one suffers through on the Hallmark and Lifetime networks.

While this film may not reach the classic Xmas status of warts-and-all holiday fare like ""A Christmas Story"" or ""Christmas Vacation,"" it is on par with that other model of off-the-beaten-track Christmas entertainment, ""Bad Santa.""

Acting as a hostile ""ref' to their marital squabbles, this thief helps them work through their issues, something that probably would not have happened had these two stubborn people NOT been held at gunpoint.

Add into this mix hostile/snooty relatives coming over to visit, a town of funny characters and inept police trying to locate the thief, and one very drunk Santa Claus and you have a really excellent dramedy that brings laughter and heart to this Christmas tale.",1357344000,,736,4.6461538461538465

585347,5,6303153348,"In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated comedies of the 90s.  One possible reason for this is that it's a Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer movie that isn't a bigger-than-life, in-your-face blockbuster (or attempt at one) that is usual for these two guys.  And you have to have an appreciation for dark and gritty humor.  This sure isn't your sugary sweet Christmas fare that you trot out for the little kiddies or have it playing in the background when the family is over to visit.  This is the Christmas movie that you watch after the kids have gone to bed and you have a stiff drink in your hand.  This flick appeals to me because it takes a shot at a lot of the things about the holiday season that we've come to know and dislike but do out of obligation (winter travel conditions, visiting relatives when you'd much rather drive on past and get a room at the Marriott, pretending you love the holiday season when it's more of a pain in the butt than anything, increased tension with people because of all these things, etc.).

The thing that really appeals to me in the movie, too, are the things in it that you want to do but never do.  Like when Dennis Leary is told, ""That doll is my mother's and is a very old collectible, will you be more careful with that?""  so he rips it's head off throws the pieces across the room.  Or telling your mother-in-law to shut up (with at least one profanity thrown in).  Or lines like ""Connecticut is the fifth ring of hell!"" uttered through clenched teeth.

If you're uptight and live in a small town in New England, this movie will hit too close to home and you probably won't like it.  But for the rest of us:  enjoy!!",1353110400,,1670,4.365695792880259

585421,1,6303153348,"Hard to believe the glowing amazon reviews.  The Ref is the story of a very dysfunctional family who say terribly mean things to one another.  And sadly, the film is about as fun as listening to that can be.  It fails on so many levels.  A home burglar decides the best way to evade the police is to kidnap a family, invade their home, and force them to host a scheduled Christmas dinner while he attends, wearing suit and tie, posing as a marriage counselor.  All of the film's subplots, the Scandinavian themed dinner, the drunk neighbor in a Santa suit, and the son's little black market side business to name a few, are pointless and add nothing to a story suffering the same problem.  I could go on about plot, but you wouldn't believe me if I did.  The rare humorous lines delivered capably by Glynis Jones as Spacey's mother can do nothing to save this mess.  What is so disappointing of course is that the film stars the usually outstanding Kevin Spacey, so the viewer begins with high expectations.  But don't expect shades of American Beauty here.  And The Ref is no War of the Roses either.  You hope for the funny, sarcastic, biting, and smart dialogue Spacey is famous for, but there is nothing remotely humorous or witty about the constant, non-stop jousting between Spacey and his estranged wife played by Judy Davis.  Likewise, by the time you've listened to Denis Leary's fifth or sixth forced and profanity laced emotional outburst, you're over them.  Good Morning America blurbs on the DVD case that the film is ""Hurt your sides funny!""  Well, The Ref is about as funny as two daily hours of network morning ""news"" programming, and equally mindless.  As for the amazon reviewer who writes the film is his new favorite holiday movie, that's like saying packaged fruit cake is your favorite Christmas food.  Writers Weiss and LaGravense must harbor deep personal resentments toward family and viciously unleash them on their characters.  It's not clear what else could explain the words they've put to paper.  I can't imagine folks wanting to watch something so dreary as this at Christmas or any other time.  Once again, there is no joy in writing a bad review.  But The Ref is about as fun as an episode of Divorce Court.  Hugely disappointing.",1316131200,4,2263,4.707379134860051

Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.",1308528000,,658,5.158878504672897

585427,5,6303153348,"Burglar Gus (Denis Leary) has a few issues.  He's just been unexpectedly sprayed with cat urine.  His partner still can't figure out why they took ""Happy Days"" off the air.  Worst of all, he's managed to hijack his ""(expletive) parents,"" or the nearest thing.  The trouble is, it's Christmas Eve, not exactly a prime hostage taking time of the year.  But the local cops are out in full force trying to track him down.  Leaving the upper crust Connecticut town or the ""ninth level of Hell"" right away is too risky.

Gus's hostages, Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) have problems, too.  They have a rocky marriage and have difficulty coming to an agreement on such matters as to whether their son (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.) is sensitive plant or a budding psychopath.  The only thing they agree on is that their therapist should shut up and let them fight.  You get the impression the therapist is considering doing just that.

But fighting must take a back seat to figuring out how they can host the family Christmas while still technically being held hostage by Gus.  The family is currently fueling up at a diner (""Heaven knows what we'll get to eat at Aunt Caroline's.) but they're due soon enough.  Their son is also arriving home from military school, where he's been running a scam of his own.

Surprisingly, the get-together is less than idyllic.  The arriving cast consists of Glynis Johns, as the grandmother from hell (of whom Gus says, ""I've known loan sharks who are more forgiving), the in-laws and their two children (who may need future therapy after the night is over).  Gus poses as the Chasseuers' therapist, Caroline serves an authentic Scandavian dinner that includes burning headgear, and the wacky high jinks are cranked up full throttle.  By the end of the evening, tears will be shed, feelings will be hurt, foreheads will narrowly avoid being singed, and several of the guests will themselves be wrapped up like holiday presents.  Also, a Christmas tree gets attacked, a put-upon police chief gets his revenge, and an intoxicated neighbor dressed as Santa, helps save the day.

There are a few sweet moments where it looks possible that the characters might forgive all and hug, but the movie never descends into treacle.  If you've ever longed to gift wrap your family during the holidays, ""The Ref"" will resonate.",1291766400,,2365,4.835820895522388

Spacey is in fact the highlight of this occasionally very funny and always very nasty little Xmas flick. He plays his character close to the chest at most points, avoiding the near-slapstick of some other actors here. Leary is better than usual, toning down his inherent meanness and doing his role justice in the meantime (but I will never love this guy, both for his complete ripoffs of so much of Bill Hicks' material and for his unbelievably mean comments at the end of his Comedy Central roast).

The real highlight here is the script, in any case, and the cast can barely keep up with its endlessly scathing lines. The counseling scene at the start is truly excellent; sounds like the man and woman who wrote this have logged some hours in that room. The small town cop scenes also smell of writers' revenge, especially the exceptionally nasty riposte from the police chief at the end. Ouch. But the writing is invariably tight and everything moves along quickly and without too many dead moments.

All in all, well worth watching, but not with the family and not with someone you're having relationship issues with; it might all hit a little too close to home.

I truly believe that this is possibly one of the funniest movies ever made or at least one of the funniest Christmas related films to ever be released, no scratch that it is one of the funniest movies ever made. And since the holidays just passed I decided it was time for another Christmas related review, this one here though is a film for every time of the year since it is so funny. Everything from the writing to the acting to the direction is pure perfection; this team should have come together more often and delivered more of these films. I remember the first time I had seen this was at my Aunt's house in Austin, I was visiting Texas at the time coming from Maryland and she popped it in. I had always liked Denis Leary so I knew I would enjoy this film, but I didn't expect to end up likening it so much that I went out and bought my own copy the next day.

It is a simple of enough story in that it is all about a cat burglar [Leary] that is hiding out from the local police after a job goes bad, that is literally what the movie is about. What makes things all the more interesting is that he happens to end up hiding out with and taking hostage a married couple on the rocks that really seem to hate each other with a passion. And if that wasn't bad enough for him it just so happens to be Christmas so the entire family is coming over and they hate each other just as much as the couple. Add in a career criminal son who is on the way home from military school and you have all the makings of one of the funniest films to ever be produced.

Denis Leary is absolutely perfect and in his element all through out this film as Gus, his wit and delivery for every line is incredible. This is probably the best film he has ever done or at the very least one of the best the man has been a part of. I was a fan of his from his stand up but this movie made me love the man's skills. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lloyd the underachieving momma's boy who is constantly at battle with his wife Caroline. Speaking of which, Judy Davis is just as good as his wife and holds her own with both of the lead actors with ease. She and Kevin going at it about her infidelities and him giving up everything are priceless, especially when they are driving the person who has them hostage crazy. If the film would have just had these three in it, it still would have been a classic in my eyes. These three make for one on the best on screen teams I have had the pleasure of seeing, they need to do more.

The supporting cast is just as good and entertaining take Robert Steinmiller Jr. for instance who plays the couples son Jesse. Talk about a kid who would have been right at home with Macaulay Culkin on ""Home Alone"". The kid actually blackmails his drill instructor from military school before he goes home for Christmas; he gets a lot of cash. J. K. Simmons by the way was wonderful in that part as the instructor. Also top notch performances are given by Raymond J. Barry as the lead cop, [these are the rest of the family] Christine Baranski as Connie, Adam LeFevre as Gary, Phillip Nicoll as John, Ellie Raab as Mary, and by B.D. Wong as the marriage counselor. But Glynis Johns almost steals the show as the matriarch of the family; she is responsible for Gus delivering my favorite line of the film when she is being tied up. Richard Bright is excellent as well in this film as Murray; he is just as funny as the rest.

Director Ted Demme keeps things going at a lively pace and things never seem to get boring or slow, in fact once it is over you are left wanting more because it was so good. Still all credit should not go to the director because the film was written by Marie Weiss and Richard LaGravenese and the delivered one hundred percent with this film. Their writing is quick and witty and full of comedy, what a great combination. Producers Don Simpson {R.I.P.} and Jerry Bruckheimer sure did know how to get the right comedies done together, The Ref, Bad Boys, and the first 2 Beverly Hill Cop films. The two really had a good eye for these types of films.

Normally I would say when reviewing something that this might not be for everybody, but I happen to think that this time everyone could enjoy this film as much as I did. It has a wonderful cast and crew behind it who knew what they wanted and got the job done.

585535,5,6303153348,"Judging by the DVD cover, you wouldn't expect this film to have any correlation to Christmas. However, like DIE HARD (but to a higher degree), Christmas is the backdrop for this hilarious film about a family kidnapped by an inept burglar. Denis Leary plays a jewel thief who, after a bungled burglary, is forced to take a feuding couple hostage in order to avoid the police. However, the couple (played to a ""T"" by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) prove to be too much for ""The Ref"" to handle. The title gets its name from the fact that Leary must continually resolve the differences between the constantly bickering family members. Once again, I believe this film could have packed a bigger punch at the box office had they only changed the title. Non-sports fans won't give a film with the title THE REF a second glance. Sports fans will be turned off once they read that the film isn't actually about a real REF. Then, the fact that there is no reference to Christmas on the cover, will keep people looking for unique holiday fare from picking up the box.

The film continues to pick up steam as more and more of the family members - and a couple confused cops - show up at the house. No one gets along and THE REF has no where to turn. If you are the type of person who enjoys films like PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES where conflicting views can repeatedly prove comical, then THE REF is a surefire way to add a fun spark to your holiday movie collection.

Maybe it has something to do with a smart and funny screenplay by Richard LaGravanese (The Mirror Has Two Faces, Living Out Loud) and Marie Weiss.  Obvious physical humor is supported by a hysterical cleverness throughout the film, which also benefits greatly from inspired performances.  Denis Leary is terrific as Gus, the robber/kidnapper, and Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey are his perfect foils.  One of the funniest moments in the film is Santa, getting kicked out of the house, by the upset parents.  His 3-second monologue is a classic.

585611,5,6303153348,"This is just a must-see at Christmas for those of you with dysfunctional families that fight on the holidays.  You will roar with laughter at the antics of this movie.

Basic premise:  Gus is a burglar whose last big job gets botched and he ends up taking a couple hostage while the man hunt goes on to find him.  Unfortunately, he picked the worst couple possible to kidnap as even a gun in their faces won't stop them fighting.  Fortunately for them, Gus's really straight-forward attitude and blunt approach to their fighting actually breaks through this couple's problems and starts them to see what they're really fighting over.

This is definitely a black humor kind of film and NOT really a family flick.  Think of it a bit like ""Bad Santa"" but not so vulgar, just a lot of swearing.

But everyone you see in this flick is someone you probably know or are related to.  The couple that are struggling to keep their relationship afloat, the juvenile delinquent of a son, the brother with no spine, his hen-pecking wife, their two chubby kids that are yelled at constantly and best of all the absolute worst mother-in-law that is so inherently evil you root for her downfall when Denis takes her on.

585614,5,6303153348,"Denis Leary is one of the funniest comedians in america. He is a great actor, and he was very attractive in the ref, and his humor is unique and contagious. We all can relate to unpleasant holiday get togethers with the fam, and the mother in this movie, the grandma, is JUST LIKE my grandmother who i disowned and they act the same way and say the same rude and haneous things even at the dinner tables and during the holidays. AND my grandma also has money and uses it against everyone as a threat. So I and am sure many others can relate to this movie which happens to also be a comedy. Because we all know that guss is just another typical thief with no wife or kids, and obviously does have a heart and morals and he has to step in and referree this fighting family constantly while he hides from the cops and waits for his partner to get a getaway car, or in this case ends up being a boat. Kevin Spacey is another one of my favorite actors and he's also great in the ref. He plays the father who was cheated on by his wife with a devilery man. So it's pretty much non stop laughs and denis leary is hilarious and hot and a big turn on (for me) and if you like denis leary, check out JUDGMENT NIGHT, and his stand up comedy NO CURE FOR CANCER, which is also funny as hell, but judgement night is a thriller and learry plays the villain, and the cast and acting is great also and the cast includes emilio estevez. I've seen the ref 100s of times and still laugh as hard as i did wen i first saw it. I'm about to buy it on dvd here soon... i can't fathom how some people hated this movie.

This movie is similar in theme (the tables are turned on the kidnapper), although filled with some very funny one-liners (my favorite is a line about the need for a mute switch).  Dennis Leary is a Christmas Eve burglar in wealthy ""New Baybrook"" Connecticut, who sets off a boobie trap, alerting the police (who are totally inexperienced at dealing with serious crimes). They set up a roadblock so burglar Leary can't get out of town, so he kidnaps the wife of a fighting couple (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are driving home from a visit with their marriage counselor. He makes them take him home, although they are expecting Spacey's truly awful MIL and other relatives (including Christine Baranski) for dinner.  Their headed-down-the-wrong-track son is due home from the last-resort military academy he's attending.  But no wonder the son is so troubled -- his parents never stop bickering.  Burglar Leary ends up being a kind of marriage counselor to this rather affluent but deeply dysfunctional family.

This is definitely a Christmas movie, but if you want cute little elves and jolly old Santa Claus, this isn't the movie for you.  It's definitely an adult movie, and the language is probably not appropriate for delicate ears or those sensitive to bad language or some sexual comments.",1104105600,2,1378,4.965217391304348

The angst that Spacey and Davis going at throughout the movie is simply hilarious.  You wonder how people could hate each other so much.  The interplay with Spacey's extended family is really funny.
It is like taking a Christmas dinner where the family does not get along, and adding a lot of spice to it.  There are so many funny scenes in the movie that you will not know what is coming next.

585617,5,6303153348,"With so many reviews, I guess the core materials have been covered.  So, into the fray!  American Beauty was much hailed, but Ref, essentially an earlier concept of the same movie, went unrecognized, due to its comedic classification.  The Ref utilized some of the same cast members, whose performance there, I felt, was superior.  Despite the show's sometimes goofy presentation, the issues and emotions had far more depth than the later release.  Too, Beauty had a preachy quality, telling you how to live your life.  The Ref, doesn't really tell you how; it just says you can't control everything that happens to you - deal with it.  Furthermore, Beauty had a flitty feel (perhaps a result of the repetitious musical cues), simply inhanced by one-dimensional characters, who never really connect.  The Ref's characters are very similar, on a basic level; and yet, they not only connect, they clash painfully.  Even the insignificant townsfolk have layers of unexplored realism.  These people are forced to confront their issues, to learn and grow.  Beauty's people, on the other hand, seem to drift even further into their own isolated misery, spiting the movies intended message.  Leary's role in The Ref is multi fold.  Primarily, he is the catalyst of change and the voice of chaos - little effort on his part.  Ultimately, while his humor may have removed the film from any Oscar contentions, it also gives the viewer a much needed stress release valve.  The drama there is so intense, you get the idea that this family would happily choke the life out of each other.  When (like me) Leary goes off on a rant, anger is displaced with negative jocularity, creating an antithetical surrealism.  It's like being comforted by the fact that your buddies laugh at you for doing something stupid. The ""ref"" both makes and breaks the movie.  I will concede this however; had I not seen The Ref, my opinion of American Beauty would be higher.  You know how it is; everything is relative - good is only good until there is something better (but in this case, better came first).",1075766400,4,2075,4.860398860398861

Dennis Leary (Ice Age, Stand Up COmic, A Bug's Life) is a small time burgler that meats his match in a home with a unique security system. That system fubbles his robbery and then leads him in frustration to meet Judy Davis (Life with Judy Garland, The Reagans, Deconstructing Harry) in a convienence store.
She plays the disgruntled wife the amazing Kevin Spacey (K-PAx, Pait Forward, American Beauty, A Bug's Life) who in himself is dissapointed in his life and marrage and more.
From there Dennis's character relazies he hijacked his Parents and all the relatives that go with it. On the road through this kidnapping all the characters learn about their lives, true feeligns and what is it to be true to each other.
Their son is also cleverly played by Robert J. Steinmiller, Jr. (The Ref, Rudy) who also learns a valuable lesson about his soon-to-be divorced parents.
Dennis, Judy and Kevin are amazing on screen. They dry humor and black comedy about real important human issues makes this fun, educational and extreemly humorous.
Coupled with the amazing performance of Chrstine Baranski (Happy Family, How The Grinch Stole Christams, The Birdcage) and the ever amazingly annoying mother-in-law played by Gylnis Johns (Marry Poppins, Superstar),
This movie has performances that shine with every cast member. No one is week, uninteresting or unbelievable. Directed by the late Ted Demme (Blow, Snith, Beautiful Girls) this has to be my favorite film of his.

Leary is stuck with them for awhile as he relocates his partner.  The trouble is it is Christmas Eve and the rest of the family will be arriving.  Said family almost manages to make the couple look normal.  Almost.  Leary must pose as their marriage counselor to survive the visit but surviving this family is easier said than done.
The tense situations and reality of their predicament drive the couple into being more open and the effect spreads as members find themselves finally venting their frustrations.
In the end Leary manages to get away but he leaves the family in a healthier emotional state then when he arrived.
Leary's rants as he deals with the family are classic.  One can really understand his character and his frustration with his situation.  It is almost a one-man show except that there are some excellent performances by Kevin Spacy and Judy Davis.

The uniting of Judy Davis, Denis Leary, and Kevin Spacey was inspired, and Christine Baranski and Glynis Johns (one of my favorite stars when I was a kid) provide extra pith to an already pith-laden production.
Now you know, of course, that whenever you get Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary in one film there's going to a lot of talking and a lot of ranting, and the rants are truly delicious, topped off with Spacey's line: ""The corpse has the floor!""
Judy Davis more than holds her own with Spacey and Leary, and B. D. Wong is delightful as the overwhelmed psychotherapist. As everyone gets a number in a musical, everyone gets a rant in The Ref, reminding us again of why two people argue: because they're both right.

Criminal with a good heart gets stuck somewhere during the holidays.  But whereas the folks in ""Trapped in Paradise"" were hospitable to a sickening level, the family in ""The Ref"" are absolute bickering nightmares.
Enter Leary planning the rip-off.  He gets stuck with this married couple (with one son) who fight, tooth and nail, over every excruciating detail of life.  They are already in therapy and in part their troubles stem from the wife's former infidelity.  Kevin Spacey plays the bitter husband who is equally as harsh towards his unfaithful wife.  But Leary's involvement in the two...I won't give away how it comes about or how it ends...but let's just say it is absolutely priceless.
If you know Leary's style and attitude, just place it in the context of him having to deal with two [people] who are, presumably, deep down good people.  His wit and delivery are impeccable.  You will love it!

585756,5,6303153348,"The Ref is a dazzling comedy of words, with sterling performances by Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey, who have fantastic ""chemistry"" of a couple who have bickered so long they seem to loathe each other.  It is a pleasure to watch two great actors play well-written, surprisingly complex comic roles.
Dennis Leary is perfectly cast as the harrassed burglar who finds himself trapped in an upper crust New England town and forced into hiding in a role that evolves into gun-toting marriage counselor to Spacey and Davis.  I have watched several other of his films since catching The Ref, and none comes close to using Leary's comic delivery style so effectively.  The chemistry among Davis, Spacey and Leary is pitch perfect.
Glynis Johns gives a memorably wicked performance as the ""mother-in-law from hell"" -- a character so self-centered and cruel, she gives Hitchcock's series of awful mothers and mothers-in-law a run for their money.  An added bonus is Christine Baranski as an uptight mother of two brats in over her head in the emotional battle royale that takes place among Davis, Spacey, Leary & Johns during Christmas dinner and during the opening of presents.  Further complicating the mix is Spacey and Davis' crooked and self-pitying son, home from military school (where he is a master blackmailer) in a town that suspects him of every petty crime (including stealing Baby Jesus from the town Nativity), who wants to join up with Leary's world-weary thief.
The language in this film is coarse, to say the least,  but it fits the characters and situations.  The opening half of the film is hysterically funny, and that's before Johns, Baranski et al make their ill-fated appearance.  This is an adult comedy -- no gross out jokes, no flatulence humor and only a few off-key physical jokes involving the local Santa.  Just great writing, great comic timing and great cast chemistry.  The Ref is truly an overlooked comic gem that anyone (who does not object to a liberal dose of four letter words) who has watched the petty arguments of married couples, the strained drudgery of family Christmas get-togethers and the subtly poisonous relationships with in-laws, will love.",1045612800,5,2180,4.997237569060774

If you've never seen the film, The Ref is about a burgler (Dennis Leary) who gets trapped with an incredibly dysfunctional family on Christmas Eve.  He first takes a married couple hostage, only to find that they are on the brink of divorce and so busy bickering with each other that they have little time to spare to be threatened by him.  He is waiting for a phone call from his partner and cannot leave until he gets it; meanwhile, the rest of the Chasseur family is due to arrive at any moment to celebrate the holiday.  What follows is probably some of the funniest dialogue in movie history, as the frankly loathsome mother-in-law (Leary tells her, ""I've met loan sharks more forgiving than you') and the rest of the family arrive and Leary has to pretend to be the couple's marriage therapist.
This is a must-see movie, especially for the holidays.  Quick, witty dialogue and excellent performances make this a stand-out.

Now, back to the review.  This is a movie that is GUARANTEEDto make you laugh until it hurts and you are on the ground, laughing so hard that your crying.  This is also a very underated movie that should've gotten a lot more recognition.
It's about a Christmas gone straight to hell.  Denis Leary plays a theif who is fleeing from the cops when a robbery has gone wrong.  He takes a couple hostage, hoping to hide out in their home and stay away from the police.  Well, he's about to find out that he's going to wish the cops had caught him, because the couple he has taken hostage are bitter, angry, and always yelling at each other.  Gun or no gun, this couple will fight and argue until Hell freezes over.  Leary does his best to try to calm things down, but he just might lose his sanity before the night is over.
Denis Leary steals the show, spewing some of the funniest lines ever heard.  He is presented as the foul-mouthed, anger-filled comedian we all know and love.  Kevin Spacey is also very funny in this movie, and this was before he was famous.  The script is very original.  This is a holiday classic that should be on everyone's list.
What are you waiting for?  A freaking invitation?  Go and see this movie already!  You won't regret it.  This has to be one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  An orignal work of art, if you ask me.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, but for now, I guess the VHS will just have to do.

This movie is the film equivelant of a good shot of Bushmill's whiskey: strong and dry, the humor evaporates on your tongue and leaves you wanting more. Denis Leary is a cat burglar who kidnaps a bickering couple (Kevin Spacey and Judi Davis) to help him escape the cops after a bungled burglary.

Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey are electric as the embattled duo: neither have surpassed these roles in their many subsequent brilliant performances. If you grew up with more verbal knockdowns than eggnog at Christmastide, then this one's for you.
I confess that the Swedish dinner sequence particularly appeals to me since my own fighting mother tried to capture certain Danish yuletide traditions in a context much like the one which faces Judy Davis.
Some have objected to the profanity and vulgarity of the script. However, if you've lived through a dysfunctional Yuletide, you'll know that it's healthier to curse than to smolder!",970790400,2,961,5.246753246753247
585868,5,6303153348,"Director Ted Demme, based solely on the strength of this movie and ""Beautiful Girls"", establishes himself as a great architect of snow-drenched tales of suburban loneliness.  The cynical sweetness of ""Beautiful Girls"" is present here in small doses, but it gets stomped to pieces by bitter familial dysfunction.
Kevin Spacey -- in my opinion the coolest actor working today -- gives a performance here that I rank as his best.  I know that others would point to the flashier roles of Verbal Kint (Usual Suspects) or Lester Burnham (American Beauty), but for me Lloyd Chasseur (pronounced with as much pretension as you can muster) is the be-all and the end-all of Kevin Spacey roles.  He is the ultimate put-upon husband/mama's boy, and his pathetic dreariness could not be any lower or any more real.
Judy Davis -- who we don't get to see enough of these days -- is just great as the domineering wife, spoiled rotten by her upbringing and eternally disappointed with her failure of a husband.  Her rage and her ice-queen exterior are just diaphanous enough to cover her unhappiness.  She and Kevin manage to subtly hint that Caroline and Lloyd once loved each other, but now only loathe each other.  They make a great tandem.
Denis Leary -- in the title role -- plays the middle ground between these two fine actors.  And he does superbly.  His Gus is a criminal and a loser, and he knows it.  Ripping off the Chasseurs is an opportunity to get out of cat burglary, and rid himself of his hapless partner Murray (a drunken Richard Bright).  Leary is a fine comic who very rarely shows much acting range, but here he shows us Gus' quick temper (quite easy, as that is also his comedian persona) but also his humanity and his morality (relatively speaking, of course).  If he had just relied on spitfire one liners and burning intensity, the whole movie would fall on top of him.  Many kudos to Leary for holding his own here.
The rest of the cast is quite fine, sprinkled with competent and familiar faces.  They include Glynis Johns as the ultimate hard-assed matriarch, Christine Baranski as the plastic daughter-in-law, and a small but pivotal role for J.K. Simmons (one of my favourite character actors... he's Schillinger on TV's ""Oz"") as the military school Commandant blackmailed by the Chasseur's ne'er-do-well son.
The script is tight and witty, the setting is a hysterically insipid Christmas season in an affluent Connecticut suburb, and the story gets all the satirical moments just right.

Next to the Grinch trying to steal Christmas, this is the most uproarious  funny send up of Christmas I've ever seen, yet after watching it you still  feel good and miraculously it extends the good cheer. Leary plays a master  thief, who robs and then takes hostages, Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis, and  if he knew what trouble they would be, he would have run faster from them  than the police. These two yuppies take arguments to high art, with Leary  only barely having control because he has a gun, but that does not stop  their tirades. Add to this wild mix is the family coming over for dinner,  gourmet-cooked by Judy Davis, and they hate it. The great Glinnis Johns, as  Kevin Spacey's mother, is wonderful, as is all the supporting cast. Only a  super-animated character like Leary can keep up with this wildly funny,  fuming couple and try(barely) to sort things out. From start to finish, the  film rocks with verbal velocity, sight gags(the Swedish candle headpieces  were my favorite, with mother saying ""my head is getting hot,"")  and a drunken neighborhood Santa turning quite Scrooge-like and whacky when  inebriated. The laughs never stop but like most movies there is a short  time to try to stop all this nonsense, draw some moral conclusions(after  all this is a Christmas movie-kind of) and find an ending. The ending isn't  very clear, for we have seen and heard so much. It would be difficult to  draw just one conclusion. Suffice it to say that The Ref is the funiest  movie I've watched in years.
