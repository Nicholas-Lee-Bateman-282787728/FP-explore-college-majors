Old Juan makes his living the hard way, by pulling it a handful at a time from the living stone of the mountain. Each day, he trudges up to his ramshackle pulleys, and hoists himself down into a trembling crevice of fear and hope. Hope for the ore that will pay his way in the world, fear of death and darkness if his pick breaks through that one crucial support. On this day, his hope comes true - he sees that streak of mineral color he's sought all these years.

And his fears come true. He is buried, his body broken under tons of boulders, and his unconsciousness outlasted his lamp. But then, he gets up, he works his way along the clear passages, deeper into the stone. He encouters a not-quite-human being, one who shifts in shape, color, and face, and who leads him on a quest with no goal. When she shows him her heart, he sees deeply into it, and beyond - into the world of literal truth, perhaps? Much in this movie is Latin American, especially the mix of New World pagan and Spanish Catholicism. Some is uniquely Mexican, including a dance with death - sensual, driving, and as stylized as Bergman's chess game.

As much as I like this movie, it's decidedly mixed. It's visually intense, but with a sound track that adds little. Even if you don't know Spanish, the handful of subtitles don't clarify much. The filming and effects are decidedly low-budget, but used carefully. Sometimes they even convey the formal rigor of a waltz, danced on a rubble floor in jeans and rags. And, for all the personal passion and articulate vision that drove this movie, this DVD transfer is technically flawed to an uncomfortable degree. Edges blur, framing has peculiar moments, and finer points of color seem unreliable. Be warned, the technically fussy viewer will find this a waste of attention. But, if you attend to the Juan and just a bit of a world we can't normally see, it's unforgettable.

8120190,2,B000FBHCE6,"The box states plainly that this film is 'letterboxed', but the print is actually full frame, and rather soft. The infuriating thing is that both the trailer and the 'photo gallery' are culled from a very sharp widescreen print. That's right: the photo gallery is made up of screen grabs from a WIDESCREEN print, to which I can only assume the makers of this DVD had access. But instead of giving it to us, we get stuck with something that looks like it was mastered from an old VHS tape.

As for the film itself, it's basically the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey stretched to 98 minutes. Having said that, even a film of marginal interest gains immeasurably from being presented in the framing intended by its director. Too bad.",1154476800,3,739,4.556390977443609
