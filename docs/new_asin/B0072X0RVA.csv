This dvd is beautiful, I wish it came it with aroma therapy!!!! The Lavender field is
stunningly beautiful, acres and acres of gorgeous rows of perfect lavender. Bees.......... buzzing all about and just waves of lavender. If I was not so allergic to bee stings, I would want to roll in the lavender rows...it is that pretty. The music is lovely and calming. I have purchased a few of these Lifescapes dvd's because they take a stressed out person, out of themselves. I believe the lavender fields could be in France, because they grow so much of it there. However, California is also a big producer of lavender. The whole dvd is just glorious.

The beach scene is also lovely with great music. The lapping waves at the seashore, the birds overhead, on a real sunshine day. Sometimes, I put this on and lie back with cucumber slices over my eyes (very refreshing, but hold the salad dressing!) and I just relax.

I purchased this one from Target stores, as well, because at the time of purchase I did not realize that Amazon carried it. Of course, the price is always better at Amazon! These are so nice and so wonderful, the photography is lush and clear, with deep bold coloring and the dvd's are unending.

These dvd's are also perfect for getting a cranky child to sleep or for calming a nervous pet, during a noisy afternoon. The music on all that I have purchased is just wonderful, calming, serene and classic. A great choice, once again.

I found the Lifescapes series, purely by chance and I have loved everyone that I have purchased, so far.",1378512000,3,1760,5.13986013986014
