8496318,5,B006C1ELTW,"This is a good little movie; I remember seeing it on the ""Late, Late Show"" when I was a kid. How come it is only available on DVDs which play exclusively outside Region 1? Why only Region 2? Doesn't whomever produced this DVD want to earn as much as possible from this release? There are an awful lot of people in Region 1!",1490313600,,323,4.142857142857143
8496319,5,B006C1ELTW,"Yvonne Mitchell was outstanding! The rest of the cast were certainly up to the task of this very well written, timeless story. Heart wrenching domestic tale of a man trying to relive his youth.",1458432000,,193,4.705882352941177
8496320,5,B006C1ELTW,I saw this movie as a youngster and it has stayed with me all these years due to the remarkable performance given by Yvonne Mitchell. Her desperation and pain is heart wrenching to say the least. I'm so glad it's finally available on DVD. Highly recommended if only for Ms. Mitchell's acting.,1429747200,,292,4.634615384615385

8496322,5,B006C1ELTW,"A rather slovenly working class housewife (Yvonne Mitchell) is content with her lot in life. In love with her husband (Anthony Quayle) and proud of her son (Andrew Ray), everything seems good. What she can't see is that her husband is unhappy in their marriage and in love with a younger woman (Sylvia Syms). Unless you're a Streep or a Nicholson, most working actors work to pay the bills and are lucky if they get that one role ""of a lifetime"" as it were. You may never get another great part again but you have that one performance and no one can ever take that away from you. The role of Amy Preston is Yvonne Mitchell's one great role and she is amazing! It's a part that some actresses would have done and gone all actress-y on us but Mitchell hits all the right notes (she won the best actress award at the Berlin film festival for her work here). She's touching, she's funny, she's annoying, she's real. The forerunner of all those British kitchen sink dramas like LOOK BACK IN ANGER and SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING, the director J. Lee Thompson (THE GUNS OF NAVARONE) gives us a gritty look at a working class marriage and how when our dreams never materialize, we still hope. I'm not sure how I feel about the film's ending. On one level, it seems like a total cop out but given the nature of its characters, it seems inevitable. With Carole Lesley and Marianne Stone.

The Optimum Region 2 DVD is a nice B&W full frame transfer.",1384819200,,1445,4.452830188679245

8496324,5,B006C1ELTW,"It's unfortunate that I don't have the time at the moment to write a review worthy of this remarkable film, but I simply could not resist the opportunity to recommend it very highly.

I had never heard of Yvonne Mitchell before I saw WIADG on our local public access cable channel, and I have to say I was deeply moved and more than a bit mesmerized by her performance. The other rles were played with equal skill and subtlety, and the camera work and directing were top-notch.

I saved the movie on my DVR, and have watched it several times since it first aired. I hope to find a way to get a DVD copy (one that is USA-compatible) for my own small collection of classics. Yes, it's that good.",1352851200,4,693,4.323076923076923
