Still kind of shocking some of the stuff coming out of her mouth in this, especially since this was made in 2005, a couple of years before 2007's Halloween.",1427587200,,314,4.0
8359448,1,B002AGOA80,"First off I'm a huge fan of Scout Taylor-Compton and sadly she was the only thing good about this film. I wish I could say she saved this flick with her undeniable talent, but no. It also didn't help that she was the only competent actor in the bunch. Don't waste your time or money with this flick, cause it truly fails across the board. PASS!",1360713600,,344,4.2272727272727275
8359449,5,B002AGOA80,This is a very powerful movie about a young girl who is abused. The movie itself is flawless from start to finish. It really shows the graphic detail of what can really go on in someone's life by being abused. The overall quality of the DVD is great. It looks really good on big TV's as well. Not as clear as blu-ray but still really good quality! This is not a cheaply made DVD!! This is a professionally made DVD and it is great.,1335916800,,431,4.142857142857143
8359450,5,B002AGOA80,"An excellent indie movie, and it is disturbing at parts and knowing that Scout Taylor-Compton was only 15 in this movie, yes, 15 years old. This movie is really good, but has some really horrify scenes. It deals with adult entertainment which a minor is doing. Disturbing, again, but a must see.
Scout's performance was excellent.

Special Feature:
Making of...

DVD: The DVD includes a Making of, but sound and video is not very good. The sound is very weird, sounds as if they voiced over them. NO SUBTITLES or ADDITIONAL AUDIO.",1272326400,4,530,4.75
8359451,4,B002AGOA80,"In this movie you can see how a little girl that has a realy traumatic childhood, is trying to overpass that and improve her life. But unfortunately, the gosths from the past won't make that easy. You can see that when a person suffers as much as she did as a child, it is very difficult to forget it, and try to start a new life. Her pass would always be there. I really liked the drama, it is a story that has much of reality.
