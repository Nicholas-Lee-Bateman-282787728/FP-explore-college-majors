The story starts on the day of Marlo's husband's funeral, where she is consoling her young children. We soon learn (when Marlo tries to cash in an insurance policy) that her husband's body has never been found, and therefore, she cannot collect the money.

As the movie unfolds, shocking secrets are unveiled, concerning incestuous child molestation, and by the end of the movie, a flashback reveals what really happened to Marlo's husband.

The only valid criticism I've seen about this movie, is that Marlo is too old for the part (the movie was filmed in 2004, and she plays the mother of a 7-year-old boy.) But if you like Marlo, you can easily overlook that, and enjoy this great Lifetime movie!",1375401600,,859,4.601307189542483
