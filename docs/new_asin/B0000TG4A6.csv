Auntie Ballistic
-A quasi-continuation of Cursed Case Scenario, Lupin get's invited over to have a steamy date with Fujiko, but what he get's instead of a sultry vixen is a brash ballistic Italian godmother who claims to be Fujiko's aunt. What she wants is simple; Find some lost WWII treasure hidden by the Germans in Africa and Lupin can marry Fujiko, fail and he dies. No problem right?

Rats to You
-Goemon gets to have the spotlight in this episode. Teaming up with another descendant of Japanese master thieves, the two are trying to restore their family honors by stealing something that their ancestors were duped out of by none other than Lupin the First

The Lair of the Land-Shark
-The worst has happened, Fujiko got herself locked up in prison with a handsy warden looking to jump her bones with or without her consent. It's up to Lupin and the gang to save her, but that involves getting into prison and outwitting the devilish anti-escape security the warden created himself.

Shot Through the Heart
-Jigen and Lupin are at a crossroads this time. Jigen's got his eyes on a woman who fancies him, but the thing is, she wants Lupin dead. Will this web of deception cause these partners to have a final showdown?

To Be or Nazi Be
-Now this is a tricky one. Germany is cut in half by the old Iron Curtain. On one side somewhere is Hitler's lost loot, on the other side is the only living Nazi officer who knows where it is. It's gonna take some doing to get the old timer over the wall and jog his senile memory, but nothing some acting couldn't help.

The Little Princess of Darkness
-Lupin has faced many pains in the neck in his long career, but this one can even outmatch Zenigata. When a little girl steals a priceless stamp that he's been scouting, he'll have to figure out how to steal it back while also making the girl's dream come true",1523923200,,1913,4.467048710601719

8002671,5,B0000TG4A6,these are several episodes i never got to see on cartoon network and i can see why some episodes are borderline for tv loved it,1357689600,,127,4.12
8002672,5,B0000TG4A6,"Whether your prefer the original Japanese track or the English dubbed version, this is one of the better collections of Lupin's adventures.  Fans of the series will enjoy Miyazaki at his finest in ""Rats to You"" and ""Shot Through the Heart.""  This is also the only disc to prominently feature Fujiko as the main character on the cover, reason enough to add this to your collection!",1209945600,,380,4.742424242424242
8002673,5,B0000TG4A6,The fun never seems to die when your watching a Lupin the 3rd DVD. It has the wonderful Tony Oliver doing the voice of Lupin. He makes Lupin..Lupin I'm sorry. I can't watch the other version of Lupin without Tony. The episode are really good.,1178668800,,242,4.4
8002674,4,B0000TG4A6,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average. I will wait for next volume.,1142467200,,891,4.681528662420382
8002675,5,B0000TG4A6,"The wait is finally over!  Geneon (formerly known as Pioneer) has released the episode, ""Hitler no Isan (Hitler's Legacy)"", AKA ""To Be Or Nazi Be"".  I could understand that with the episode being about Hitler and all, that us North American viewers would have to wait until Lupin the 3rd became more popular, but all in all, I don't think it's that offensive.
It even has some of my favorite episodes, ""Rats to You"", ""Shot Through the Heart"", and ""The Little Princess of Darkness"".  Being used to watching the series on the Cartoon Network Adult Swim block, I was pleased to see that each episode had their opening theme, eyecatches, next episode previews, and ending themes.  I was especially surprised that ""The Little Princess of Darkness"" had different versions of the opening/ending themes, and were preserved on the DVD.
The only thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of extras, which contained only conceptual art and the trailer for the upcoming PS2 videogame, and the fact that the next episode previews only came on their respective previous episodes, instead of directly before the actual episode.  That means the preview for ""Auntie Ballistic"" is NOT included in this DVD, and there's a preview for ""Revenge of La Nerd"", which I have to wait for on the next DVD.  Oh well.  I'm anticipating that, anyways.",1076371200,5,1320,4.8923766816143495
