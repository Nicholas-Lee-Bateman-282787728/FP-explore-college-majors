8074084,5,B000A3G5R4,The film is very funny! David Wenham as the Spiteri character is priceless. The commission section is worth the price of the DVD. The whole is cast great and the script is super..,1380844800,,179,4.454545454545454
8074085,3,B000A3G5R4,"Whenever a film has a ""cast of thousands"" those thousands can be little more than cliches and stereotypes. And this film has an array of good guys and bad guys and not-so-sure-about guys that forces the writer to reduce them to those bare essentials. So this promising film is laid low by just such a failure. We don't know how the sting will occur, but after about 15 minutes the basic plot lines are all too clearly laid out and we just have to ride along to see how they are played out. So a generally delightful cast is forced to do too little, and a couple of whopping implausibles and unlikelies come together to build a pleasant, but ultimately forgettable, film. Nicely done, with yet another glorious performance by Timothy Spall, who does seem able to do about anything, but not anything that will last.",1369872000,,813,4.575342465753424
8074086,4,B000A3G5R4,"I really liked this Australian film. It has a great cast Sam Worthington/Avatar, David Wenham/LOTR (who is a riot and steals the show)Timothy Spall/Harry Potter and too many more. Worthington portrays a savy guy, fresh out of jail and attempting to go straight and harassed by a crooked cop, gets roped into a mess and has a suprise ending. The plot has some nice twists (written by Chris Nyst, Aussie defense solicitor and award winning author)and the characters are a hoot. It really has some fun scenes, a couple of slow spots are the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

It won more than a dozen awards, including Australian Film Institute's Best film, Best Screenplay 2003, (and best actor for Wenham among them).

If you like the slightly different pace of a foreign film, you'll really like this. I've watched it 2 times and I still laugh out loud at Wenham as ""Johnny Spitieri"". Would definitely watch it again.",1351987200,,921,4.714285714285714
8074087,5,B000A3G5R4,"The first major film for Sam Worthington showcases his talent before becoming a major star in Avatar.  David Wenham is hilarious as the drug addicted support actor, the court scene had me in stitches!  A good laugh and a good story, well worth viewing.",1341100800,,252,4.704545454545454
8074088,4,B000A3G5R4,"Usual for Aussie movies mix of naivety, crime, copulating, drug-issues, kicking-the-faces and swearing resulted in a-little-with-reality easy-watching police comedy disclosing unwillingly a gray empty nothing-upon-a-life to do existence of an-even-ethnic-majority-belonged commoners in Australia.

Nice performance and music add to entertaining side of this movie.",1175731200,,364,7.2727272727272725
8074089,4,B000A3G5R4,"Just saw the last two-thirds of this movie on the Sundance channel.  Neat, clever Aussie comedy, with good acting and directing--a great ""feel good"" movie with the almost good guys winning over the bad guys.  Very entertaining.  Tried to find it online so I could see it all, but alas, not gonna happen until it is released in USA DVD format.",1135296000,2,342,4.573770491803279
8074090,5,B000A3G5R4,"If you want to see David Wenham do a complete opposite of his ""Noble Faramir"" in Lord of the Rings, THIS is the flick - his itchy, twitchy Johnny Spit is priceless as the junkie who isn't quite the dumbass he appears to be.  A fun movie that is amazing heart-warming, considering the characters are all cons and ex-cons!  If you're looking for a funny comedy that pokes gentle fun at the hard time criminals have getting away from the old life, you'll enjoy this.  This is a super little Aussie movie that it is a crying shame isn't available in Region 1.  I had to watch a friend's, and wish there was some way I could get my hands on my own.",1129852800,8,643,4.203252032520325
