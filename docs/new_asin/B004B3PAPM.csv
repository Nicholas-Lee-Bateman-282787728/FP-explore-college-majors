4313009,5,B004B3PAPM,"This is a wonderful old TV performance of the classic operetta; beautifully sung and appropriately performed. How amazing to have this treasure released and available ! My only regret is losing some of the other characters and songs, but they could only do so much in 90 minutes. ""The Desert Song"" goes on !",1295827200,21,307,4.703703703703703
4313010,5,B004B3PAPM,"this version of the desert song is marvelous- considering it was on tv in 1955-this is a great copy and so wonderful to have a record of the american baritone nelson eddy in a live performance-
his voice is as golden as in 1935-and gale sherwood was lovely too-
perhaps there will be a release of all the jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy films done as well as this one was- great show",1295827200,3,386,4.301369863013699
4313011,5,B004B3PAPM,"Considering that this is made from a live TV show so many years ago, it is quite good.  It is presented in two acts with a nice cast, including operatic bass Salvatore Baccaloni.  Video Artists International (VAI) notes that this is ""the only document of Eddy in a live performance of a complete musical."" A must for Eddy fans.

4313012,5,B004B3PAPM,"The chemistry of Nelson Eddy and Gale Sherwood in this live TV production of ""The Desert Song"" is a joy to watch. The quality is quite good considering that this was copied from a kinescope, I only wish it was in color. However, that does not diminish the magnificence of Nelson Eddy's singing...in his 50s in this performance, his voice sounds as velvety smooth as it did when he first appeared in ""Naughty Marietta"" with Jeanette MacDonald in 1935. Now, all we need is to have all of the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald movies released on DVD so the world can become acquainted or reacquainted with this unforgettable couple.",1294444800,40,630,4.736363636363636
4313013,4,B004B3PAPM,"Desert Song was  Nelson Eddy's only full length performance on live TV.This print is remarkable considering it was remastered from a kinescope copy, of a live NBC color broadcast in 1955. Eddy and Sherwood head a brillant cast of Broadway and opera performers. The songs and dances are robustly  performed, and Eddy & Sherwood's voices blended perfectly. Too bad this was their only film together, but their highly successful night  club act lasted  15 years, until Nelson's death This film serves as a lasting  reminder of that long and caring relationship.",1293840000,38,558,5.087912087912088
4313014,3,B004B3PAPM,Great music and well done for an early TV b/w presentation.,1406160000,,59,4.454545454545454
4313015,2,B004B3PAPM,It seemed to be not very well done or unprofessional.  The songs were good but the sound was not up to par.,1403913600,,107,3.8636363636363638
4313016,5,B004B3PAPM,truly a magnificent musical with nelson eddy and gale Sherwood doing a splendid job love the music and fantastic singing,1403395200,,120,5.05
4313017,5,B004B3PAPM,"I love Sigmund Romberg more than any of the lite opera composers of those days.  The Desert Song was one of his best.  And who of us oldsters didn't love Nelson Eddy?

For anyone who likes  operettas and the mid easy listening era, you cant top this !!!",1402876800,2,253,4.208333333333333
4313018,5,B004B3PAPM,"Nelson Eddy in his 50s! I gather he could be a terror in real life, but in movie magic he was just perfect!",1401840000,2,107,3.6956521739130435
4313019,3,B004B3PAPM,I was disappointed as I thought this was the movie not the same and Nelson Eddy was old.  Unfortunately as I live in Australia could not get the other Desert Song with Katherine Grayson as it was not compatible to our dvd system,1386115200,,228,4.3023255813953485
4313020,5,B004B3PAPM,This operetta by Sigmund Romberg is a favorite. I really enjoy NelsonEddy's singing. The story was written in 1925  during the time of French Algeris and is not in any way factual. A really fun fantasy.,1385078400,2,202,4.611111111111111
4313021,5,B004B3PAPM,"Just couldn't resist the chance to see Nelson Eddy in a live performance. I fell in love with him all over again!
Nothing like a good old-fashioned plot and beautiful music to please us pre-rock age old oldsters! Great fun!",1376524800,2,223,4.6
4313022,3,B004B3PAPM,"This was taken from a live performance of a TV performance. It has a disconcerting 'behind the scenes' bit at the front which detracts, but the actual performance works quite well. The two things that are off putting are (1) that, having been told it is set in Morocco in 1927, all the ladies are wearing very 1950 dresses, and (2) Nelson Eddy is way too old to be the son of the camp commander. If you shut your eyes and just listen, the music is great and the 'leit motif' of the French Military Marching Song is great.",1374710400,2,521,4.2727272727272725
4313023,5,B004B3PAPM,"So happy to have the recording of Nelson Eddy in a live performance.  What a treat that it is in the wonderful Romberg operetta, ""The Desert Song"" with all of it's beautiful songs.  Thank you for making this available.",1370736000,2,218,4.564102564102564
4313024,4,B004B3PAPM,I HAD HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND IT. THE MUSIC WAS ABSOLUTELY ENCHSNTING. IT IS SOMETHING I WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN,1369180800,2,147,4.103448275862069
4313025,2,B004B3PAPM,"was really looking more for one that he did when he was younger
very disapointed in this production  by the time I was able to watch this I was sorry I could not return it",1356566400,,171,3.8857142857142857
4313026,4,B004B3PAPM,Though older than his character should be the voice was everything.  The quality if early TV but the music and singers are first rate.,1355356800,,134,4.583333333333333
4313027,5,B004B3PAPM,"Devotees of theatre and musicals know there is worthy interest in this desert romance saga, from the early stage play at the turn to the 20th century ""The Red Shadow"" through the 1929ish movie, and the finally, glorious movie of 1953 with Gordon MacRae and the delicious Kathryn Grayson, a coloratura contender for the ""Best Ingenue of all Time."" Macrae was very good, Grayson, fantastic, but the plot sequence of the '53 movie was altered, stripping many of the beautiful songs and dances out.  That was a neutering of the story.  In this Eddy version, filmed on a stage presentation, the original plot sequences and all the missing songs AND DANCES -- scrapped from the 1953 movie -- are gloriously restored.  Eddy was slowing down but still in excellent voice and Gale Sherwood was marvelous, not as pure as Grayson, but excellent nonetheless. One cannot fairly criticize the video of a well-staged stage presentation.  The players are not in a real desert:  they're on a stage! This is a faithful presentation of the original plot AND MUSIC and should please devotees, aficiandos and new lovers of musical theatre.",1317945600,11,1118,4.925531914893617
4313028,3,B004B3PAPM,Received item quickly.  Content was as expected for the time period it was made. Enjoyable if you are a fan of Nelson Eddy.,1315440000,2,123,4.3478260869565215
4313029,5,B004B3PAPM,"This black and white TV production  seemingly is the only one that exists of Nelson Eddy, one of the best baritones our country has ever known. While the 1955 production obviously use  ""Broadway Play"" mentality, direction and staging, it never the less clearly shows Eddy at his best. Although an older man at this point in his life, he sang the role flawlessly- and as an added bonus, the production included Gale Sherwood, his partner to be in his night club act. Sherwood, while not able to hit some of the same notes as Jeanette MacDonald, was the perfect match for Eddy- you could clearly understand evry word she sang- such was not the case with MacDonald.  A truly great find for the serious Eddy fan.",1315353600,2,708,4.603174603174603
4313030,5,B004B3PAPM,"Being a long time fan of Nelson Eddy, it was a real treat to see this made for TV movie.  I had not seen it on TV.  It's a shame there are not more movies such as this and more music such as Mr. Romberg's.",1298764800,5,205,3.533333333333333
4313031,3,B004B3PAPM,"I felt disappointed in the production for a couple of reasons: First, were the costumes. Supposedly it was 1921, but the women were all in 1955 dress plus absurd harem garb. Second was the hoky and over-long pseudo-Arabic dances. BUT, hey, all balanced out with wonderful Nelson Eddy. The music was fine. I sure would like to see the Jeanette MacDonald/Nelson Eddy movies released in DVD.",1298160000,8,388,4.893939393939394
4313032,5,B004B3PAPM,"My mother was a huge Nelson Eddy fan and loved Eddy and MacDonald's films.  I grew up watching them on TV and have come to love them as well.  Nelson still had a great, booming voice.  He and Gale Sherwood had good chemistry and she had a wonderful voice.  Watching them together gives you an idea of their nightclub act.  Considering this was taped off a live TV performance I am amazed at how well this stands up.  For live TV the sets were very good.  Also fun to see Bambi Linn dancing, she was quite a sprite of a dancer!  I imagine it was an event to watch live TV back in those days!",1297209600,5,590,4.069565217391304
4313033,5,B004B3PAPM,"Singer Nelson Eddy is most associated with Jeanette MacDonald because they made so many filmed operettas together. These films play on TV often and have been available for years. Less known is that Eddy performed a television adaptation of Sigmund Romberg's classic The Desert Song in 1955, produced and directed by Max Liebman - the man responsible for the classic Sid Caesar variety show, Your Show of Shows. Liebman produced a series of ""specials"" for NBC in the 1950s under the title Max Liebman Presents and, lucky for us they were recorded on videotape (early videotape!). This performance of The Desert Song is finally available on DVD and it's a joy to watch. Sure it's in black and white. That's what TV was in 1955! And, yes, there are a few blurry spots to the edges of the screen but that was what it looked like when it was aired. Remember broadcast television wasn't even a decade old at this time. The sound quality for this time period is superb and I noted no distortion, even on the high notes sung by Eddy and his post-MacDonald singing partner, Gale Sherwood. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  There are four dance numbers - in different styles - choreographed by Rod Alexander and featuring him with partner Bambi Linn, who often appeared on Liebman's Show of Shows.

There's not a lot of dialogue among the singing but Eddy carries it off well. Because the TV version had to fit into a 90-minute slot, and there were cars to be sold (Oldsmobile was the sponsor, but the commercials do not appear on the DVD), the plot had to be edited and adapted down to 78 minutes. One of the three adaptors was another from Libeman's stable: playwright Neil Simon! This was the ""Golden Age of Television"".

VAI's release of this show deserves thunderous applause for give us the best copy available. The DVD is indexed properly so that you can find specific songs upon repeat viewing. Add to this a delightful (though fantasy) love story -the French and the Spanish and the Moroccans all speak with East Coast accents! - and this DVD is a winner.

8421443,5,B004B3PAPM,"As a fan of Macdonald/Eddy works, this was thrilling to see and hear like an unreleased Eddy film after 50 years! All the hallmarks of an Eddy's films with Jeannette Macdonald are covered so well by Eddy's current answer to his call, the soprano Gale Sherwood. All the vocals with a chorus (male or female) when necessary are well-preserved in a luster the original television audience would not have heard. An additional bonus of this production is the marvelous dancers and actors who accompany the screen legend, Eddy. Although some footage might have been edited out, the pacing and entertainment provided by the dancers and soloists never lets up. At the end of Act I, by then Sherwood and Eddy have had at least 2 duets to express their affection for one another, he as elusive leader of the Riffs who terrorize the French Foreign Legion. Eddy (Pierre) is the son of the legion commander (Otto Kruger). Two dancers mirror the affection expressed by Sherwood and Eddy in a solo number dancing in the shadows of the trees with the dunes as backdrop that would be only more graceful if attempted on ice, very effective nonetheless in black and white. The astounding thing to witness is Nelson Eddy's voice at age 54. You can see the awe and admiration in chorus members when he delivers like he always has. He ascends the scale with ease and booms to catch the orchestra in pitch like the master he was in his 30s film musicals. Gordon Macrae and Ann Blyth did a technicolor movie version a few years before this that plays as a silly farce in comparison with too much comedy relief. Here, with a brief summary of intent by Eddy before this production begins, he sets the tone for those who want to dream along with the characters.  With at least 3 cameras, including one that telescopes, this is as close as one could get to a movie musical and with Eddy and Sherwood this delivers a wonderful musical fable.",1517097600,,1912,4.623529411764705
