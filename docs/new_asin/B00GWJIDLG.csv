8627942,3,B00GWJIDLG,"The main actor, the one who played Verde, had some pretty cool moves that the movie slows down but all the other fighting seems to have been sped up a little bit and it really takes you out of the movie. The story is nothing special but it's not terrible. The acting is bad.. it could be that the actors can't speak English well though. Some of the movie is in a foreign language with subtitles it might have been better if the whole film was done like that. The stunts are good throughout the movies. Plenty of bottles and tables are broken throughout. During the end credits there's a bloopers reel that shows some of the stunts being messed up and it really makes you appreciate the effort and skills. You can tell the crew had a fun time making this movie. I feel like I would have really enjoyed this movie is the fight scenes speed did seem so weird.",1490659200,,856,4.290123456790123

8627946,2,B00GWJIDLG,"I'm not going to write a treatise on good film making.  People like what they like, and film, and as with every other medium of visual storytelling, it is a subjective experience.  But there are certain generally accepted unwritten rules that we as consumers have learned to expect when digesting certain types of movies.

To those who favor action movies, we come to understand that for us to consider it good, then you accepted and appreciated the spectacle of it.  What you saw on the screen was visceral and exciting.  Your brain processed excitement, and your body responded in kind.  Because of that expectation in this particular genre of film, we give allowances for certain deficits.  What I mean is, you don't watch a film like ""the Raid"", ""Die Hard"", or ""Rumble in the Bronx"" and expect to have been moved by clever storytelling devices and deep character development.  On the contrary, an overly complex plot can be detrimental for viewers who have trouble digesting a layered story along with visceral explosions and special effects or martial arts. These kinds of movies actually come with an expectation of loosely threaded plot that is just active enough to keep your audience from getting bored, but loose enough to give you a breather between the next big spectacle.

The martial arts genre is unique because the spectacle is usually a person.  Someone who can complete impressive stunts or beautiful, graceful choreography that challenges your understanding of the physicality that one human can accomplish.

With all that in mind, you have a film like ""Mortal Enemies"".  You can throw out arguments pertaining to the budget and what was available to them, but the fact remains that the spectacle of this film, the martial arts sequences, aren't strong enough and aren't paced well enough to keep you from thinking about the nonsensical story they're presenting.  The filmmakers seemed to want to present lofty and deeply touching motivations for their characters, but they don't seem to understand how to create a character arc to make you 1)Identify or 2) even care about the struggles of their characters.

The first third of the film goes by with almost no significant action scene which leaves you nothing but time to try and understand the lazy premise and poor character development.  When you're finally presented with the action, you are left feeling more annoyed with the stilted dialogue and lazy, cliche plot points that feel like an amalgamation from half a dozen Hong Kong Kung-Fu films that have done it all immeasurably better in the past.

You see, even in a martial arts action movie, you have to CARE about the character you're watching.  Identifying with their plight creates drama, which is implicit in investing emotionally in a story.  If you can't care about the goings on of the story even a little bit, then you're not watching a movie.  You're watching fight choreography clips, which you could do more efficiently on YouTube.

The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because of the the stars and stunt team.  The fights were tolerable, and might have even been forgivable had the director chose to film them in wider and more dynamic angles with longer takes and fewer cuts.  It's clear the action team are talented enough.  They deserved someone more capable of serving the action which is unarguably the most important aspect of the film.  But the film is what it is, and the films stars deserved a better chance to display what they are capable of.",1400457600,,3501,4.894915254237288
8627947,4,B00GWJIDLG,"Usual martial arts story line, two kids in orphanage get separated and meet again 20 years later. You guessed it, all hell breaks lose. About 33% you must read subtitles but this movie is one fight after another.",1400112000,3,212,4.605263157894737
8627948,3,B00GWJIDLG,"Like many folks, I'll always remember Robin Shou for his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;- not only because I like the movie, but because he hasn't had too many notable parts since then. It's surprising that he went about fifteen years without a starring role, when I'm certain I wasn't the only fan eager to see him cut loose again as a martial arts superstar. Well, it's finally happened: after languishing without a wide release for about three years, ""Mortal Enemies"" is finally out in North America and sees Shou receive both top billing and screen majority. Disappointingly, it's not exactly the full return to form I had been hoping for, and not a perfect movie in other aspects either.

The story: twenty years after being separated and seeing their brotherhood shattered, Sunny (Shou) and Verdy (Imade Bhawanta) meet again as pirate and businessman. Necessity and retained loyalty drive them to combat a plot that puts Verdy and his fiance in danger.

While Shou's name and experience likely helped the film, he sort of puts himself into a vulnerable position by appearing alongside younger and fiendishly athletic stars. His co-lead, Verdy Bhawanta, is not only twenty years Shou's junior but also a noted capoeira practitioner, and I think it's safe to say that he outruns Robin for the money. But even with a lot of exceptional talent in the credits, the action content is in trouble. There are about seven fights here, and I think only two are particularly good. The camera consistently hugs the action, providing too little room to appreciate the choreography, which ends up being on the bland side too often. Slow motion is slightly overused. Shou looks quick and strong but doesn't do too many exciting things, whereas Verdy occasionally shines through the use of some smooth dance-fighting and pro wrestling moves. Curiously-cast Brazilian fighter Marcio da Silva does well enough for his role but his end fight isn't that spectacular, whereas a seemingly indestructible enforcer played by Ryan Adriant is more impressive.

A lengthy backstory ends up providing the two leads with 50% more character than is the norm for these pictures, which is fortunate because as soon as the movie kicks into full action mode (about 40 minutes in), the drama this one had going for it promptly dies. Sunny and Verdy take turns being inconsistent in their resolve and feelings towards each other, and the screenplay attempts to tell too much of the story too fast by rapid-firing the plot twists into your lap with little chance to digest anything. Everybody does well enough when it comes to acting, though only when speaking a language they're comfortable with: about 60% of the film features Indonesian dialogue, with the rest being English, and whenever Verdy goes from the former to the latter, it's a bit uncomfortable to listen to. The soundtrack, however, is surprisingly atmospheric and fun.

If he manages to seize more prominent roles, Verdy Bhawanta has a chance of being mentioned in the same breath as Iko Uwais. Robin Shou, on the other hand, seems to have been out of steam here. I'm pretty disappointed that he doesn't make more of an impact in ""Mortal Enemies,"" especially with the level of freedom that independent films like this are afforded. Maybe he was trying to make his costars look good, but for me, Shou was the main reason to see the movie and he just doesn't make it entirely worth it. Bored martial arts fans should still feel free to give this a watch, but don't count on it to become a new favorite.",1394323200,,3664,5.0813953488372094
8627949,5,B00GWJIDLG,"This is the second best martial arts movie after the Flash Point with Donnie Yen and some Jackie Chan fall-and-crash classics. The beginning of Mortal Enemies was somewhat slow as half of the movie was a childhood story of the main two characters. Despite some minor acting/directing glitches such as showing the characters driving at night with indoor lights on, etc., all imperfections do fade once you actually see the unbelievable fighting sequences, which perhaps is the main reason why one rents this movie here. The latter made me search for other titles with the Mortal Enemies lead actor Verdy Bhawanta. Alas, Mortal Enemies is the only one I could find referenced in IMDB. Hopefully, this great Indonesian martial artist will appear again soon in other movies.",1393891200,3,770,5.070866141732283
