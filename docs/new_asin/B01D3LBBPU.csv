7696464,5,B01D3LBBPU,"Adapted from an unproduced play by Harry Segall, HERE COMES MR. JORDAN is a witty 1941 comedy-fantasy that inspired a 1947 sequel (DOWN TO EARTH with Rita Hayworth), plus two remakes, HEAVEN CAN WAIT (1978) and DOWN TO EARTH (2001).

In this Oscar-winning (for writing) original, directed by Alexander Hall, Robert Montgomery stars as a boxer who is headed for a championship fight until he is killed in a plane crash. According to the people upstairs, he was not supposed to die in that crash, so now Heavens head honcho, Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains), has to find Bob a new body that will allow him to get his title fight.  The body that Bob, ultimately, enters is that of a recently murdered multi-millionaire, which leads to even further complications.

Evelyn Keyes plays Montgomerys romantic interest in the film, which is virtually stolen by Edward Everett Horton, as the angel who mistakenly took Bob before his time, and James Gleason, Oscar-nominated for his hilarious performance as Montgomerys befuddled fight manager.

Seventy-five years later, this picture holds up very well.

The Criterion Collection has given HERE COMES MR. JORDAN a sharp new Blu-ray release; a 2K digital restoration with uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  Extras include a new conversation between critics Michael Sragow and filmmaker/distributor Michael Schlesinger; a 1991 audio interview with actress Elizabeth Montgomery discussing her father, Robert Montgomery; a 1942 radio adaptation of the movie featuring Cary Grant, Claude Rains, Evelyn Keyes and James Gleason; the theatrical trailer and a booklet containing an essay by critic Farran Smith Nehme.

Those are all easy four and five star affairs, but the description of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" as being a comedy does it a great disservice.  It's not a bad film, and good for a small chuckle here or there.  But it is much more a sentimental type film along the lines of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" than a true screwball comedy of any kind.  And much like that film, if you grew up with it, it likely carries a magical charm that gets lost a little for the rest of us.  For new watchers, at least in my family, Jordan came across as a sweet, sentimental film, but overall not that memorable and more than a little repetitive (Montgomery continually saying he's ""in the pink"", and his boxing manager's antics go from ""cute"" to long in the tooth after the 10th time).  If you like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", you will love this film.  If you are looking for true screwball comedies from the 30s and 40s, I would pass on this and try one of the others listed above. Even taken for what it is, I'm glad I saw it once but IMHO it did not live up to its hype.

The quality of this Criterion bluray itself?  Truly excellent.  One of the best restorations I've seen in while. There are some nice extras, including an interview with Robert Montgomery's daugther (from TV's ""Bewitched""), but like the rest of the extras here they are all audio.  Regardless, if you've seen this movie before and like it and want to know if the extra money is worth it, the production here is very worthwhile and topnotch. If you get it, look for a brief line by a young Lloyd Bridges (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B001K37CT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>) in the cockpit for the first time :)",1498867200,2,2951,6.596899224806202

8754794,5,B01D3LBBPU,"Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film with great performances by Robert Montgomery and Claude Rains.  The premise of ""coming back to life"" in someone else's body was very interesting and different (and it seemed to be copied several times over the years).  The storyline, dialogue, and acting are great; this one is worth a try.

The transfer is very good, excellent picture and sound quality, and the extras are typical from Criterion.  Subtitles are available if needed.

The 1991 audio interview with Elizabeth Montgomery was really good.  She speaks quite fondly and lovingly of her father without sugarcoating him, or making him ""the greatest dad in the world.""  I thought she was quite honest about him.  My favorite story she told about him was the prank he pulled on her the first time she ever saw one of his movies (which was the thriller Night Must Fall).  She talks about what it was like growing up with him, about his career, and a little about hers as well--worth a listen!

If you like this film, I also recommend its ""inverse"", the film Angel on My Shoulder, with Claude Rains and Paul Muni.  Rains is just as wonderful a devil as he is an angel!  Both come highly recommended!",1474329600,4,1228,4.713615023474178

8754798,5,B01D3LBBPU,"A Matter of Life and Death (1946), A Guy Named Joe (1943), and Heaven Can Wait (1943) are but of a few titles in the fantasy genre in which someone dies and comes back to Earth. Here Comes Mr. Jordan precedes all these. Robert Montgomery stars as Joe, a boxer, pilot, and would-be saxophone player who is about to get his shot at the heavy weight title of the world. With Joe being a pilot, anyone can easily see how this lead character will meet his end. However, Joes death tuns out to be a mistake, he wasn't supposed to die for another 50 years. An over eager angel, Messenger 7013 (Edward Everett Horton), took Joes soul from his body soon thinking he was surely to die in the plane crash. Unfortunately, Joes earthly body is cremated before the mistake can be corrected, so the powers that be decide to give him another body. The only problem is, Joe spent his life training/loving his old body and still has that heavy weight prize fight on his mind.

Here Comes Mr. Jordan came as sweet surprise to this film aficionado. The powers that be in this film take form as Mr. Jordan, played by none other than Claude Rains. Being a fan of the actor, I was surprised to have never heard of this film, especially knowing full well that Rains played the antithesis of Mr. Jordan in Angel on my Shoulder (1946). Rains is only third billed here, but his presence in the film is powerful as he shapes the destiny of this boxer in his new body.

The story is easily accessible through Robert Montgomerys performance. In being a child of the eighties, it is evident that Quantum Leap producer, Donald P. Bellisario, drew inspiration from Here Comes Mr. Jordan for his story about a man changing bodies and helping the greater good. This is what happens in the film. Joe assumes the body of a rich, greedy man named Farnsworth, who was just murdered. The dark comedy ensues when Farnsworths wife, Julia (Rita Johnson) and her lover are shocked to see that the man they just drowned is walking around. Joe also finds out that Farnsworth had shamefully wronged a man in business deal, a man who now is imprisoned and whos beautiful daughter Bette (Evelyn Keyes) has come to fight for him. Mr. Jordan encourages Joe to set things right in Farnsworths life before moving into a permanent body that is more fitting to his athlete way of life. Joe agrees and quickly makes Farnsworth into a new man and starts to woo Bette in the process. Before long Joe has everything going his way, including a new title shot. That is, until his wife and her lover start scheming again.

The love story is the key to Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Robert Montgomery and Evelyn Keyes really sell the audience on their would-be romance. Nothing physically happens on screen between the two (Joe is technically married to the woman who killed his host body) but there is enough longing to see that these characters both want something good from this life despite what is happening around them. This love story is important because the time comes when Joe must leap again into another body and is left with no memory of any of his other forms. Can Bette see the soul of Joe in a new body? Are the two really meant to be together? All your questions are answered in one of the best bittersweet love stories that anyone under fifty years of age has never seen.

The Criterion Collection has, once again, released a beautiful restoration. The film itself may seem odd to us now (with what a boxer once looked like, especially), but its a movie from another time. It has a great deal humor and love mixed perfectly with the bittersweet. You will not regret adding Here Comes Mr. Jordan to your Criterion library.
