4525634,4,B0051PLR4W,"Reboots are a double-edged sword.

On one edge is the depressing realization that Hollywood has genuinely run out of ideas. Using their business model, they've completely crushed all original thought and ingenuity from within. When 'Swimming With Sharks' came out, I was amused at what I believed to be satire. Turns out it was a documentary in disguise. I really shouldn't be surprised, not really. The so-called progressive herd mentality that exists there today in 2011 tends to foster the worst types of misguided hardcore entrenched mindsets, not the least of which results in dead creativity.

On the other edge is that they're quite adept at taking an older product and spiffying up with a bit of modern polish and adding a sharper tack. Taking something old-n-rusty and making it look and feel new again is a genuine talent, and it's one I appreciate, even if it's essentially parasitic.

Such is the case with 'Wrecked' - an engaging reboot of the classic 1953 movie 'Inferno' starring Robert Ryan. I tried to locate an Amazon Product Link, unfortunately it has yet to find a commercial release, so you'll have to take my word that this production is indeed a reboot.

So what happens when you awake trapped in terrible car wreck - and you have absolutely no clue how or why you're there? Bloody, injured, dead bodies laying around, and apparently you're the only survivor. It's a clever twist on the original screenplay. And adding traumatic amnesia adds a dramatic flair, as Brody's character has to struggle with the loss of his very identity in an effort to understand his predicament.

Like the original, this film tells the story of a man who has to survive in the desolate wilderness with a severe injury and no hope of rescue. Your only chance is what you yourself bring to the table; what resources, knowledge and internal strength that you carry within.

Interestingly, the filmmakers removed treacherous would-be-killers and replaced them with the unknowns of nature. Truth be told, I'd rather face the killers. Natural predators are infinitely more terrifying than some thug. With a murderer you're dealing with humanity; certainly it's not the best of humanity, but at least rage, jealousy, fear or envy are emotions and rationalizations one can understand. Even a paid assassin has professionalism as a justification. But when you're facing a natural threat, it's just following what is in its nature, which I find so much more coldly threatening. The axiom 'nothing personal' takes on a truly grim and terrifying visage.

An excellent film and one, like the character himself, you need to endure to receive the reward of revelatory knowledge.

Personal Note: Adrien Brody has, in my mind, supplanted Daniel Day Lewis and Gary Oldman as the chameleon actor of choice. Deservedly so, his range is truly amazing. His performances border on a word I avoid like the plague - magical. But bleep me, that's the word that fits. I will never forget his work as a mentally retarded young man in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>' or as one of the funny dysfunctional brothers in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Darjeeling-Limited/dp/B003KGBIS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Darjeeling Limited</a>'.

Perhaps there is some deep philosophical importance to this film, but that will only be found by a select few. I had to fast forward to the end - which was just as unimportant as the rest of the movie. You get to watch a guy trapped in a car for days on end who finally frees himself. Then he crawls for days on end, he manages to swim for most of a day and then continues crawling for days on end till hes finally rescued by a park ranger.

4525639,3,B0051PLR4W,"""Who's Raymond Plazey?"" After waking up in a mangled car in the bottom
of a ravine with a broken leg the man (Brody) has no idea how he got
there. Doing everything he can he tries to escape the car and find
help. This movie, much like ""Buried"" and ""Castaway"" involves pretty
much one character the entire time. Very little dialog and prolonged
scenes of trying to open a door make this a hard film to get through.
I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but it is very, very slow moving.
The acting by Brody is very good and it's worth watching to see him.
Much like the movie ""Memento"" the lead character is going about his
life trying to figure out who he is and how he got there. Unlilke
""Memento"" there is really not much that sucks you in and makes you want
to keep watching. I got through it, but it was a struggle. Overall, a
very slow moving one character movie that is watchable, and only
because Brody does a good job. I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - Nope

4525640,3,B0051PLR4W,"The horror!
Imagine: you wake up in a car wreck at the bottom of a ravine. Your face, as you can see in the front passenger mirror, is bruised and bloody. Your leg is stuck under the dashboard. You don't know who you are and how you got there. The driver seat is empty. The front window is smashed. There is a dead man on the back seat. You don't know him. You turn on the radio, and among the brief snippets that you catch are Tiny Tim's hit song (which might help with a time line, together with the car model) and a piece of news about a bank robbery.

Are you one of the robbers? You find a revolver below the driver seat. You find a credit card in the name of one of the robbers, which had been mentioned on the radio. Are you Raymond? After some time you manage to wriggle out of the car. Your leg is broken. You improvise a stabilizer by using pieces of wood and a belt. You hallucinate about a woman coming to help you. You hallucinate about a puma around the car, then about a friendly dog. You start crawling away from the wreck. You find 2 more dead bodies. You begin to remember bits and pieces. You find a road....
No spoilers here.
All this might sound like good suspense, but it is, after all, just so...so. The script is not carrying a full length feature. Brody is credible but left alone. The story is too often confusing between hallucinations and actual events.
Not a stupid flick, but somehow deficient. Not enough meat on the bone! Not for the puma and not for the dog.",1313280000,20,1491,4.213286713286713

His leg is trapped under the dash. He has 2 dead friends with him, one has a wallet. His name is George. Brody apparently isn't carrying ID. The window is busted out so he can drink rainwater. The door is jammed. Over time he hallucinates about a woman who seems to want to help him. He discovers a revolver with discharged shells on the driver's side. His memory is in disarray.

After several days, Adrian manages to free himself. The film is about is journey to safety.

Adrian Brody plays the role well. The movie is interesting, but not overly entertaining. The twist is fine, but this should be an ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and not a 90 minute feature.

A good dramatic actor who almost always nails the role.  The plot for the movie is about a man who wakes up injured and stuck in a car in the middle of the wilderness up on a mountain side in the forest.  He has amnesia so he can not remember who he is or how he got there.  He finds dead bodies, a revolver and a bag of money.  He is badly injured and the only life he sees is a mountain lion who comes to get the bodies to eat.  He keeps seeing a mysterious woman and a big dog.  While it could be an intense film, and it is in some sections, it tends too feel too stretched to fill the time period.  A man against nature type film while he regains his memory.

4525682,3,B0051PLR4W,"***This review may contain spoilers.  I wouldn't read it until after you've watched the movie!***

Wrecked is in the vein of 127 hours, but with additional mystery surrounding how Brody started out in the predicament he was in at the beginning of the film.  I couldn't tell if this was a very mystical and challenging movie or one that was poorly written and riddled with plot holes.  I would love to hear from other viewers on how they interpreted the:
1. Dog-  Does the dog represent his Spirit Guide like in some of the Native American traditions?  Is the dog a hallucination that his subconscious created to motivate him to move and not give up?
2. Woman: Is the woman his girlfriend or does she represent the teller that was killed in the robbery?
3. The man who steals the money gets killed by the cougar.  He was carrying a hunting rifle.  How did he get killed, or was he a hallucination too, meant to represent the guard killed in the robbery?
4. How many full-grown men could a Puma eat in a two day period?
As you can see, I'm torn on this film.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful!  It looks like they filmed this near Vancouver, and I have to say, it is some of the loveliest deciduous forest I've seen in some time.  Brody gives a great performance as the man who wakes up in a wrecked car, that has crashed down a wooded slope into a densely wooded area.  I just felt like I was missing some key bit of information that would explain some of the hallucinations.  I would love to discuss this movie, because it left me a bit confused as you can see from the aforementioned questions.  It is definitely not a 1 star movie!  The scenery and Brody's performance alone merit at least two stars. Ad in the mystery surrounding how he got there in the first place and you've got a 3 star film.

The character is likable, and the setting is perfect for the storyline. The makeup job they did on Adrien was incredibly accurate, and his performance was quite convincing. I thought the cinematography was effective, as it provided the proper angles to capture the moment, as well as enhance the mood of the scene. It was a well balanced plot, full of questions and intrigue. This movie is not for people who prefer a rapid pace and special effects to keep them interested. This is more for the folks who like a cerebral film.

You now watch him crawl through the woods as dream sequences make the viewer question if anything interesting will happen. A dog shows up but we never know if he is real. I don't want to be a spoiler (if that is actually possible with this film)so I will only say that the bits and pieces we were given as to his dilemma finally become one longer dream sequence that suddenly explains it all.

Wrecked is just that, wrecked. Adrian Brody is a good actor but not so much that one wants to stare almost endlessly at his face. The film relies on long maddening camera shots that produce nothing of interest. Brody trapped in the car at the beginning goes on so long that some may actually bail out of the movie. If a film relies on basically one character, it is helpful if you can find something about him you like to root for his survival. Brody is unlikeable throughout, and the fact that we may believe he is a ruthless criminal doesn't help.

What keeps you watching is the question of what it's all about. I don't believe this film reached the theatres for a reason, few can sit through it's laborious acts. Human survival is the lure and it's portrayal flops. Brody looks like he could have gotten pnemonia playing this part and all for an empty film....and a paycheck.

The movie begins with Brody's character--listed in the end credits as simply ""Man""--regaining consciousness in a wrecked car sitting in the middle of the woods.  Sitting in the back seat is a corpse, and another one lies in the forest about twenty feet from the car.  (You know this much by reading the movie's own description.) The next *20 minutes* of the movie are spent on watching Man wondering where the hell he is, trying to extricate himself from the car (his leg is pinned), cursing at his situation, and just looking around. Watching water evaporate is more engaging.

""Man"" finally manages to free himself from the car, and the next *60 minutes* (yes, one whole hour) is spent doing little more than watching him crawl around the forest.  (His leg is wounded from the accident and he can't walk.) Man is in the forest for (if I counted correctly) five full days, and with the exception of rain water that he drinks on day two, we see him eat almost nothing, and opportunities for water are few and far between.  Yet in spite of the severe lack of sustenance and hydration, Man is still able have the strength to do all that crawling around.  And this is to say nothing of his leg wound, which by now surely would have become infected and caused him even greater difficulty.

He comes upon a dead man in a cave of sorts, and the viewer is left utterly clueless as to who he is and how he met his fate.  He periodically encounters a woman who, as it turns out, is just a hallucination, but when you find out who the woman actually is (at the very end of the movie), you are left completely baffled as to why she says the things she does to Man and why she is portrayed the way she is.  There are also a few flashbacks that are not really flashbacks which do little more than to further confound the viewer's understanding of what the actual events are that led to Man's predicament.  Only at the very end of the movie are those events revealed, and then the movie ends abruptly.

My daughter, who watched the movie with me, and I sat for a few moments in silence at the movie's end.  We were pondering if the movie really did end the way it did (or were we, too, hallucinating?), and we were also left momentarily speechless that the whole affair was so bad.

In all fairness, Brody's acting was good, and he does succeed in generating a level of pathos with the viewer.  However, given the other considerations surrounding his performance (i.e., the plot, the monotony, etc.), it's hard to recommend this movie.  Were it not for Brody's acting, I would have certainly given this movie one star.

4525714,3,B0051PLR4W,"Adrian Brody turns in a good performance in this essentially one-man show. However, his performance alone just doesn't supply enough of a reason to spend time on this film.

""Wrecked"" doesn't provide the kind of catharsis that some other films, showing lone individuals struggling against wilderness odds, have provided. I'm thinking of such superior movies as ""Inferno"" starring Robert Ryan.

Nor does Brody show the resourcefulness that would keep us engaged, learning survival skills along the way. Brody's character doesn't exercise much ingenuity in coping. So we aren't left with any sense of triumphing against daunting odds.  There's no celebration of survival, in the way movies such as ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" inspire. The viewer of ""Wrecked"" won't feel infused with gratitude for being alive after heroic struggle.

Most of the interest of this story rests in Brody's flashbacks as he tries to piece together who he is and how he ended up in a crashed car in the middle of the woods.  But his piecemeal recollections aren't enough to carry this film. Even the turn of his final recollection doesn't bring sufficient weight to this film. Mostly, ""Wrecked"" is a man scrabbling around in the woods, injured and disoriented. And that's just not enough to make a really worthwhile movie.",1340064000,2,1297,5.099056603773585

First of all, slow-paced is too kind of a description for this agonizingly drawn out yawner. Most of the movie takes place inside a wrecked car with ZERO change in scenery until Adrian Brody manages to drag himself out of the car and into the woods. Therein lies the remainder of the movie; it's literally just him crawling toward the edge of the forest. I figured something would happen eventually, but nothing ever did. When he finally crawls to the road, the movie ends.

It's not that Adrian Brody (who I usually love btw) had bad acting skills; the problem was there was zero storyline for him to work with. I can't believe this project ever made it to film.

How anyone could criticize this movie is beyond me especially since it is one of the VERY few decent movies available on Amazon Prime for free viewing by Prime members.

Through the partially broken windshield, the body of another man lying in the woods is visible, and there is also a dead man in the back seat.  Searching the car, the man finds a revolver, and later imagines that he has been discovered by a woman (Caroline Dhavernas).

After recovering enough to travel, he crawls off into the woods to try and find help.  You would assume that a road is nearby above where the car rests, but the man heads in a different direction.  In another questionable move, he attempts to cross a river, and is swept away, coming ashore far downstream.

4525725,5,B0051PLR4W,"Wrecked is basically a one-man show, and I must say Adrien Brody turned in a terrific performance as that one man (he does his own stunts, actually eats a worm, and even supplies the voice his character hears on the radio).  Some say the movie is slow and perhaps confusing at times, but I say nay; you couldn't possibly convey the physical ordeal - nor the emotional roller coaster -this character endures in a mere half hour, nor would the ending be as effective as it most certainly is.  I was prepared to say I really liked this movie as it moved toward its conclusion, and then the ending turned my like into love.  It does require some patience on the part of the viewer, but Wrecked is a really, really good movie.

Brody's character wakes up to the grim reality of being trapped in a car deep within a ravine.  He looks like he went ten rounds with Muhammad Ali, and his badly injured leg is trapped underneath the dashboard.  Looking around, he finds an empty driver's seat, a dead man in the back seat, and another body a short distance away from the car.  He doesn't know who he is or how he got there - but it's obvious that he was in one hell of a crash.  Whatever road the car was on isn't even in sight.  If he's going to survive, he has to free himself from the wreckage and somehow find help in the most isolated and dangerous of woodland situations.  As the days and nights progress, he begins having short flashbacks about his past and finds other clues to his identity, the meaning of which is further sharpened by periodic hallucinations.  If the plot sounds pretty basic, it is - but it is by no means simple.  You'll just have to take my word on that.

I found this to be a rather gripping emotional story, thanks largely to Brody's marvelous performance (as well as some fine work from a wonderful canine actor).  There are even some tender moments thrown into the mix with all of the fury and seeming futility of his character's struggles.  You the viewer join the character in trying to piece together his identity, and that great unknown creates emotional friction because you aren't completely sure you should be rooting for his ultimate survival.

Because of the shock, it seems, the man, injured and covered in blood, remembers nothing about what happened, or even his name. I must quickly add that you shouldn't expect a ""thriller,"" however, at least in a conventional sense. The film's tone is more like that of an experimental indie film like Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"" without dialogues.

Yes, the film opens somewhat like ""Buried,"" but I find it hard to pinpoint what genre ""Wrecked"" falls into. The film's pace is very slow as a thriller. Some may compare this with Jack London stories, but he is a gifted storyteller, which the film is simply not. Apparently Brody's character sees ""things"" - I refuse to reveal what they are - whether or not they are products of his hallucinations, I frankly don't know. To me they all just look random and pointless.

Director Michael Greenspan (his feature debut) goes for realism, taking extremely long time to show the situation under which Adrien Brody's character has to suffer (including a Tiny Tim rendition of ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips""), but relies too much on the actor's skills (which are considerable, I admit) and the deserted atmosphere of the wilderness. As a result, despite some realistic descriptions of the protagonist's struggles for survival, and one Buster Keaton-like incredible stunt (done by the star himself), to me watching ""Wrecked"" was a very tedious experience.

Sit through the film with patience and you will know that everything (well, almost everything) fits in the right place with its rather flat ending. But chances are you will have lost your interest by then.",1315267200,,1711,4.954703832752613

The movie focuses on Brody's desperate attempt to free himself from the car and get help.  As he crawls through the dense woodlands, he encounters a hunter, a mysterious woman and a friendly dog---and disturbing memories surface.
WRECKED is a difficult movie to watch.  How can we sympathize with a desperate criminal?  It's to Brody's credit that we do care about his plight.
The script takes an unexpected twist and turns things completely around.  Director Michael Greenspan takes the risky task of keeping things interesting with little actual action and allows us to feel Brody's hopelessnesss and despair, and on that level succeeds.

8453019,1,B0051PLR4W,"A 90 minute film that was 91 minutes too long.

This is another one of those (more-or-less) one man movies where guy is in danger, doesn't know how he got there and has to survive (think Buried with Ryan Reynolds). The ONLY good thing about this movie is Adrien Brody. It doesn't matter how good or bad the film, he gives a role his all. Great actor but the movie is so predictable that it's a waste of time watching it.

SPOILER ALERT:

Guy is in a wreck at the bottom of a cliff. Doesn't know how he got there. Doesn't know who the dead bodies are. Has to survive. As the film passes, you realize a robbery is involved. Was he involved or just some poor schmuck? Think hard:  this is an Oscar-winning actor. It's not hard to work out what's going on. There are a few red herrings along the way, but nothing worth writing about. The only slight difference in this film and the one with Ryan Reynolds is that you actually care what happens to RR. In this one, I was waiting for the guy to go toes up....after ten minutes. Again, it wasn't the acting, just the predictable plot.",1451174400,,1077,4.264705882352941
8453020,5,B0051PLR4W,"Imagine waking up and finding yourself trapped in a wrecked car in the woods with no idea how you got there or how to escape?  That's the situation Adrien finds himself in.  While Wrecked doesn't have much of a story and is based entirely around Adrien either trying to free his legs from the trapped passengers seat he's stuck in or crawling around the forest (seriously this IS the entire movie) I couldn't help but find it intriguing.  The eerily quiet atmosphere makes it feel like something surprising is going to happen at any moment.

So yeah, Wrecked is one of those movies where you expect something amazing to happen and change the story in a big way, but instead it focuses on Adrien freeing himself, crawling around through rich forest lands and constantly hallucinating that a woman is watching him, and that a dog is following him.  However I'm not 100% sure that either the woman or dog was fake.  I won't spoil certain points in the film, but the presence of both felt realistic on a couple occasions.  Also the segment where Adrien's crawling away up a hill, turns around and sees someone taking things in the trunk of his car... this felt realistic, as did when Adrien found a bag of supplies in the woods.  I figured the bag belonged to the man who was digging in the trunk, however it's probably up to interpretation if the bag was even there in the first place (and the man too for that matter).

I liked the first half more than the second.  While Adrien's trapped in the passengers seat of the wrecked car, there's a guy in the backseat who's dead.  For what must've been at least 2 or 3 days (guessing based on how many night scenes we see) Adrien hallucinates that a woman brings him food and water, that there's a mysterious green tablet on the floor of the drivers seat he's determined to get to, and that there's a gun under the drivers seat. Actually the gun might have been true.  I honestly don't know.

The good news is that the movie is rewarding in the end... well, it's nothing particularly exciting, but the reason or Adrien being in the wrecked car is explained perfectly clear.  Let's just say Adrien has flashbacks the more he crawls around the forest.  When the flashbacks first started I thought about the situation he's in some more and felt that he's not exactly the nicest guy in the world if you get what I mean.  I was wrong however.  I loved the segment where he pretended to see searchlights and flashlights looking for him in the forest.  That part felt believable.  Oh and watch out for that mountain lion a couple minutes before the end!  That was a very good jump scare.

So yeah, you'll either find Wrecked fascinating and intriguing until its conclusion, or you'll think it's long, pointless and goes nowhere.  I'm in the first category.  Also I loved the appearance and beauty of the forest.  At first I wanted Adrien to free himself and escape... but as the story went along I found myself thinking otherwise based on certain flashbacks that were deliberately unclear intended to mislead viewers.  So I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be cheering for the guy... until the ending, then I'm happy for him again!",1443657600,,3164,4.577264653641207
8453021,3,B0051PLR4W,"Adrien Brody does a credible job. But, this move would have been a terrific 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, not an hour and forty minute movie. It might be to someone elses taste, but not mine.",1439078400,,194,4.571428571428571
8453022,1,B0051PLR4W,"I started to watch it and lost interest so as is my practice with movies I give up on, it got one star.

Adrien Brody plays a guy who wakes up after a car wreck in a forest with some dead bodies. He is hurt and has some hallucinations. He finds a revolver in the car. He eventually manages to get out of the car and sit on the ground outside. I gave up on it at that point. Just not worth anymore of my time as nothing interesting had happened yet and it did not appear like much of any interest to me was likely to happen.",1435363200,,523,3.8425925925925926
