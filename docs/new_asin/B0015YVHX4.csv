3149071,5,B0015YVHX4,"For anyone who loves Death Note, or if you just happened upon it by accident, this, the second of the movies based on that fabulous manga and anime, is perfect.  It's faster paced than the first and wonderfully done. Even the dubbing is excellent (using the same voice actors who did the anime and the first movie). Ofcourse the Japanese actors are fabulous, but Kenich Matsuyama as L is the standout blow you away performance of the much loved character L. And Alejandro Julliani does wonders adding his voice to Kenichi's performance. I also love the fact that movie assumes you either watched the first movie if you're looking at this one or at least are familiar with this story so they don't spoon feed you everything from the first over again. Great movie, great story, great acting - it's just perfect!!",1237161600,,810,4.704225352112676
3149072,5,B0015YVHX4,"For all those who enjoyed Death Note the manga or the anime tv series, it's not crazy to expect you to enjoy these well-done (if not word-for-word exact) feature films in live action.

All the principals look and sound great--the Shinigamis REM and RYUK, Light the ""Killer"", L the brilliant ferreter-outer of Kira, Misa the submissive love-slaves of Light. I was particularly fond of Ken'ichi as L. Replicating the huge, dark, round-eyed L of the anime would have been tough, even with a non-Asian actor, but Ken'ichi does a great job with posture, attitude, and L's idiosyncracies.

This is a continuation of the first Death Note film, btw. The hunt continues with the delightful twists and turns (in mortal and spirit realms) that will lead to the discovery of Kira and the vindication of L's suspicions. The finale is terrific.

This has been a truly quality story in various media--print, tv, film. I'd recommend them all, and certainly this flick.

For those unfamiliar with the Death Note world: The death note is a book (one of many) that are properties of the death gods (shinigami). One book per death god. But the death gods may allow the book to enter the human world and be used by mortals. There are rules that govern how it can be used to kill (and as Light, smart as he is, discovers, to control actions and outcomes). Write a name, that person dies, essentially. The story ends up being a tense, twisty cat and mouse game between two brilliant young men--L the detective, Light the killer--each trying to overcome the other. Two death gods play their parts, as well as a young woman who is emotionally bound to Kira (""killer""). A special team of officers are put together to bring down Kira. It turns out to be not at all easy, and things get really complicated, especially since the saying about absolute power turns out to be very, very true.

Thumbs up.",1236470400,,1872,4.695121951219512
3149073,5,B0015YVHX4,"Death Note II is what fans have been waiting for since it's a battle to the end between Light and L. This is the way the manga should have been and this is the way I will see the series. The acting is great and the look of the film is beautiful, but the Shinigami still look bleh. The most shocking thing is that they made Rem a male?! I didn't like that, the character clearly looks female or maybe a Glam Rock Star. Besides that, I can't think of anything negative to say. This is Death Note done right with the finale we want (none of that L wanna be Near!)",1235433600,,560,4.008928571428571
3149074,5,B0015YVHX4,"Based on the manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide, ""Death Note"" the live action film makes its way to the US on DVD.

""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and another theme song ""Snow (Hey Oh)"" by the popular band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.

The sequel is the conclusion to the thrilling cat and mouse chase as the murderer Kira (Light Yagami, who has attained a large cult following for killing off criminals) tries to find a way to kill his nemesis, the top investigator in the police force known as L.  While L suspects Light Yagami as being Kira.

The film is 140 minutes long, pacing was indeed well done and overall, despite being different from the manga and anime series, both Shusuke Kaneko and Tetsuya Oishii managed to come up with a thrilling, dark and gripping storyline that remains faithful to the overlying theme of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is featured in 169 anamorphic widescreen and was originally shot in 35mm (1:85:1 ratio). My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk and Rem. And how that would translate on film and the two shinigami look exactly like it does in the anime and manga series but Rem seems to look more less detailed than Ryuk. But overall, the CG works with the film.

As for audio, the film is featured in both English and Japanese via digital 5.1 and 2.0 stereo. I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series. So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features in the film include the Death Note anime trailer, the Japanese and US trailer and Viz Pictures Presents.  The primary featurette is ""the Making of Death Note II"", a 23-minute featurette which includes interviews with the director and the main talent involved with the film.  Definitely good insight of what the talent felt about the characters and the challenges that they faced.  For example, Ken'ichi Matsuyama (L) having to constantly eat sweets.  He mentions that he had to do it so much that he couldn't tolerate it anymore and couldn't swallow.  He just spit it out after the shot.  Also, explanations by director Shusuke Kaneko on differences from the live film and the manga version.  Overall, a solid featurette.

""DEATH NOTE II: The Last Name"" was extremely popular in Japan.  Having been #1 in the box office for five weeks and earning 5.5 Billion yen in Japan, the film was indeed a success.

I enjoyed the film a lot and the pacing was much better with the second film but if anything was amazing, it was Tetsuya Oishii's screenplay.  It is challenging to get so much storyline from the manga and making a live action film.  There is so much story in the ""Death Note"" manga that it would be difficult to translate all that in two films.  So, there had to be major differences in the live film versus the manga and unfortunately, for many films based from a long manga series, they don't succeed because they try to condense everything into one film.

As for ""Death Note II: The Last Name"", Oishii manages to create a new storyline that is so different from the manga series but yet manages to stay within the confines of the main focal point.  Kira vs. L and finding a right conclusion.

Having the storyline so different from the manga, I was pleasantly surprised by it but by the film's end, I was rather pleased.  Both Kaneko and Oishii pulled it off.

What I love about this film is that Kira and L are two individuals who are intelligent and the way they try to outdo each other, is always amazing.  In a way, it's like a chess game between these two as they do what they can to outwit each other.

Also, I enjoyed seeing how many other characters were integrated into the overall storyline.  And knowing how different this film is from the manga and anime series, I was satisfied with the conclusion of the film and overall, I really enjoyed the sequel.  Good storytelling by Oishii and managing to pull of a storyline that is just as satisfying as the manga but yet quite different.

If you enjoyed the first live film, then you will definitely want to pick up the sequel.  ""DEATH NOTE II: THE LAST NAME"" is a thrilling, suspenseful and enjoyable film.  Highly recommended!",1234051200,18,4900,4.61361014994233
3149075,4,B0015YVHX4,"Far more a continuation than a sequel, ""Death Note: The Last Name"" follows the immensely popular and entertaining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>. The agile game of cat-and-cat continues between Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and L (Ken'ichi Matsuyama). Tables are turned, fortunes are reversed, and a new Death Note and shinigami comes into play.

The story continues almost exactly where ""Death Note"" left off. A young and popular idol, Misa, gets herself a Death Note and an accompanying shinigami, Rem. An devoted fan of ""Killer"", she decides to follow in his footsteps, even though she lacks the genius and finesse of execution. She is much more of an emotional wild card than Light's calculated style. L is still in hot pursuit, and he gets to show his stuff a little more in ""The Last Name"", demonstrating why he has the reputation he has. There are quite a few twists and turns, but the pace is good and the film never gets slow or bound up in it's own mythology.

All of the original cast has returned, including director Shusuke Kaneko. Matsuyama, as L, is particularly good, and it is no wonder that his performance spawned a spin-off flick ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Change-the-World/dp/B001CK0Z9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L: Change the World</a>"". The new shinigamis each have their own individual look and personality, and are animated well enough that you soon forget they are CG characters. Light is a little bit too steadfast, because we all know exactly what we would do if we had an admirer like Misa, but I guess that is the price you pay for being a cold, calculating genius/killer. Still, he is a man of absolute steel, as he shows more than once.

For fans of the comic series, it isn't the literal adaptation they might have been hoping for, but it is still an excellent series in its own right. ""Death Note"" and ""Death Note: The Last Name"" are both great flicks, and it is almost a shame to see them end. Live-action animation adaptations are rarely done this good.",1231718400,6,2142,5.350148367952523
3149076,4,B0015YVHX4,"Death Note is based on the popular manga (Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I've finally finished the anime series, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan in quite a while. I will review both films because  while the first film, which is indeed phenomenal and it can definitely stand on its own, the story is very much linked together. Suffice it to say, the live-action adaptation is better when seen one after the other, and this last chapter is what gives the thrilling saga of Light Yagami and the truly odd, sugar-devouring, detective called ""L"" its closure.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:
In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.

In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami (Death God), brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.
As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (super-sexy Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.

That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts absolutely--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?

Man has no right to play GOD.

This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films. Some may say that the film also contains a social commentary.

The battle of wits between L and Light Yagami is definitely one to watch; as the two geniuses struggle to stay one step ahead of the other. It is rather curious that such a complex match-up of intelligence also proves that the two are actually two sides of the same coin but on opposing sides. L is pretty much a charming if eccentric presence as the sugar-loving detective. I didn't know that sugar does provide energy for the brain until I observed him gulp down significant amounts of candy and dessert. The thing that proves Light Yagami quite dangerous is the fact that he believes that he is doing the right thing and whatever steps he has taken may seem cruel, it is justified. When one believes his cause his just, one becomes more determined than the common opponent.

Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual with a very solid structure. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is pretty intense, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass other films in terms of plot) I will stop here, since with this film, the less you know, the better it would be.

Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

This is a sort of alternative story that picks up where the first movie left off. I highly suggest getting the first before this one if you haven't already. And if you haven't seen this one, I'd say it's definitely worth it. The storyline differs slightly from the original Death Note series, and it's very well played out, until the rather shocking ending.

The acting is on par with the first part, which is to say flawless. Everyone holds their own even when the sparks fly between the Light and L.

The CGI rears its ugly head again. However, by this point, these movies aren't about the special effects; its about the cat-and-mouse chase starring the two leads.

This movie suffers from the Kill Bill Syndrome, which is that the follow-up to a great first half pales in comparison. I was let down by this final part.

3149109,5,B0015YVHX4,"Way back in 2008, my Sister and I discovered the anime franchise Death Note.  Every Saturday night we'd stay up until one in the morning just to catch the latest episode.  A little before I watched even one episode of the show, I saw an ad in Shonen Jump! magazine for Death Note II: The Last Name to be shown in select theaters for two nights.  After seeing that ad, I decided to give the show a watch with my sister, and you just read about how well that went.  A little into the first arc of the show, I bought the first film at Wal-Mart for five bucks.  We loved the film, and thought that, even if it did change somethings(all for the better), it was one of the best adaptations of another media to film.  We tried to find the second film, but Wal-Mart didn't have it.  We thought if we waited that it would show up, but we finished the anime and nothing ever showed up.  Cut to years later, and I buy this film.  We watched it last night, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  This film makes ever more alterations than the first, but all of them are good, if not arguably better than the source material.

3149123,5,B0015YVHX4,I was a little reluctant when I got this movie. The anime was so good it's hard to imagine a movie being close. This movie was very well done. The suspense and drama are both there. The guys they got to play L and Light fit the roles perfectly. Also if you don't want to read the subtitles the english dub uses the same voice actors that were in the anime. The plot digresses a bit form the anime. Other than a few details in the first movie mostly; this film follows the original story pretty well. In this sequel Light has joined the Kira investigation team. The 2nd Kira also appears. As we all probably know Misa is the 2nd Kira. She also possesses the Shingami eyes. They become a valuable asset to Light. this is the finale of the epic battle of wits between the 2 geniuses. This film doesn't disappoint. If you like the anime then you will most likely enjoy this movie. I hope you like it as much as I do.,1351987200,,912,4.1875

3149129,4,B0015YVHX4,"Now, the live-action adaptation ""Death Note"" 1 tried a few different twists and turns deviating from the original storyline, and this sequel is no different. The plotline covers the story of Light and Misa's confinement, but then afterward--during Light's and L's investigation into the Kira murders--weaves two characters from the anime/manga (the dedicated reporter and the psychotic corporate executive) into a single character's predicament of becoming Kira's new replacement. Why did the filmmaker's do this? Well, this film did surpass the 2-hour limit, which apparently is forbidden in filmmmaking everywhere, although there just isn't enough time to keep one interested, so squishing down the storyline feels necessary in this one. I personally prefer faithful adaptations, although this one did intrigue me as to what may come next since it was similar to the fantastic story of Death Note though it continually leave me surprised by its chanceful transitions in plot and style. If you already know the ending to Death Note, then wait to be surprised, because this ending is very different; not in an outlandishly bizzare way, but in an engagingly surprising way. If you have seen the anime, then you may notice a similarity in the English dubbing from Light's English voice actor in this one as in the anime, though I have yet to research it enough; however, his Japanese face actor commits to a heart-striking performance in the Ending. I actually prefer this movie over its predecessor, because the acting was all-around better and the storyline felt more reactive.",1282867200,,1577,5.237154150197629
3149130,4,B0015YVHX4,"First of all, I'd like to warn that for those who have not seen the movie, this review may spoil the plot. This applies even if you've seen the anime and/or read the manga. The reason (which is kind of a spoiler itself) is because the movie does not follow the plot of the anime or manga very closely. Various elements of the second half the original Death Note plot (as well as a few elements unique to the movie) are combined to create a new plot, which is much shorter and simpler. This new, and very different plot isn't necessarily bad, but I don't think it's quite as good as the original plot. I usually complain when movies mess up a book's plot but in this case, the plot was altered so much that I consider it to be separate but still complimentary to the manga and anime.",1282521600,,782,4.25503355704698
3149131,4,B0015YVHX4,"Death Note II: The Last Name continues the adventures of the characters from the previous film. In this sequel, Light, (Tatsuya Fujiwara ) the homicidal son of the local police chief, continues his deadly game of cat and mouse with L, the quirky computer genius who eats only sugary snacks. These two are both incredibly smart and motivated by their own inner demons.

Plot: Light has weaseled his way onto the Akira task force, seeking to hide his own tracks. (Light is a serial killer who uses a mystic book to kill criminals for the `greater good. Unfortunately, he also kills good guys if they get in his way). L is suspicious of him, however has no proof. To add fuel to the fire, another shinigami  Rem makes his presence felt and becomes the guardian of Light's new goth-lolita girlfriend. This shinigami has a conscience however and disapproves of Light and his tactics. Rem does something quite touching twice in the film, which made me really like this character, unfortunately he is no match for Light whose diabolical nature knows no bounds.

I really liked this film better than the first one, although I did feel that the devotion Light's girlfriend was a bit sickening, it added to the believability that Light was charismatic young man. I really liked Rem and hoped for a happy ending for him/her/it.

Overall, I felt this was better than the first film. It was good to see some resolution to the Light/L fight, and I really liked Rem who was a noble being.",1272585600,,1473,4.675675675675675

3149142,3,B0015YVHX4,"This movie is something of an oddity. On the downside, the plot is too convoluted, with numerous instances of the notes being swapped from one person to another and then back again, memories being lost and regained in the process, and new notes popping up out of nowhere. Some of the acting is a bit flaky, with characters breaking into hysterics one moment and then quickly accepting the appearance of Death Gods the next. The movie also implies that there are a lot of homicidal folks working in the Japanese media. But the main problem lies with the direction, which is too flat for such an imaginative source material. On the positive side it's engagingly quirky, it's always entertaining, it looks good, and the CGI is impressive. The story is ingenious despite its over-complexity, and there is never a dull moment. With stronger direction this could have been a great movie.",1241395200,3,881,4.841059602649007
3149143,5,B0015YVHX4,"This was a really awesome movie. I had the opportunity to catch it when it went in theaters for one night only, and it was well worth it (My friend and I actually cosplayed as Light and L). The dubbing was surprisingly good, with only a few awkward moments, and all in all, it was a very tense and gripping movie.

I loved how they stuck to the original ending (Won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it) from the manga and anime, even if they had to cut out an entire second season due to time constraints. I would've liked to have seen the psychological play between Light, Near, and Mello, but to be fair, the second season was dialogue-heavy, with not quite as many action sequences.

I only had one real gripe with the movie, and that was the character of Rem. The CGI was impressive and all, but what peeved me was the fact that in the movie, the shinigami was male. In both manga and anime forms, Rem was a female; I'll admit that it was rather unclear in the manga, but just watch a few episodes of the anime after Rem is introduced, and it's pretty clear.

All in all a fantastic continuation from the first Death Note film.",1241049600,,1136,4.274418604651163
3149144,4,B0015YVHX4,"A very well done conclusion to the film based off the anime series. The film makers did an outstanding job of putting the entire series in context with subplots and plots without confusing the person watching the film. It followed the anime series about 75%. The acting was superb by all actors involved. Even if you haven't watched the anime series this film does a good job on its own of explaining everything.

Couple gripes though...

1. REM the shimigami was female in the anime series not male as portrayed in the movie.
2. While the overall plot conclusion was the same as the anime several massive plot variations weren't followed, possibly due to movie time constraints. For instance in the anime series ""L"" was killed by REM via manipulation from Light. Also, one of light's own team members actually figured him out and defeated him with the help of Near. Light's Father also was killed in the anime series but he wasn't in the movie. While this isn't a big deal to some, these are major plot point that weren't transitioned to to keep it ""pure"".

Overall this was an extremly well done movie! I wish some Hollywood directors and screenplay writerswould follow novels, games etc as well as the makers of Death note movies did.",1240358400,2,1237,4.691244239631336
3149145,5,B0015YVHX4,"Great sequel to the first Death Note movie - picks up where the other left off, whips into hyper drive with an imaginative, complicated plot that really keeps you on your toes, and actually concludes with the Death Note notebook last name revealed. I wouldn't attempt to watch this sequel without seeing part one - you have to know the main characters, how they think, their relationship, etc., right from the get go in this part two. The story in infinitely more complex, with two gods of death and two Death Note notebooks, and more twists and turns how these death sentences using can be dealt using these notebooks. As before, the main story is the battle of wits between Light/Kira (Tatsuva Fujiwara), who vacillates between his evil Kira persona and innocent Light persona, and the mysterious ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama), the detective who's trying to put an end to all the deaths. These two brilliant young protagonists are playing a game of chess (both literally and figuratively) with each other, and the ending was pretty much a surprise to me. I'm not into Mangas, so I don't know if it's faithful to that story; I do know this movie is a really good supernatural thriller, and better than Death Note part one. The DVD has about a 20 minute ""Making of"" which was quite interesting - the director explained how the Manga had to be condensed and changed for the movie medium, each major actor had a say about their experiences (""L"" never wants see candy again!), and a neat movie wrap where everyone politely claps and bows respectfully to one another.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Death Note, and also to anyone who is just a fan of good movies.

Ofcourse the Japanese actors are fabulous, but Kenich Matsuyama as L is the standout blow you away performance of the much loved character L. And Alejandro Julliani does wonders adding his voice to Kenichi's performance.

All the principals look and sound great--the Shinigamis REM and RYUK, Light the ""Killer"", L the brilliant ferreter-outer of Kira, Misa the submissive love-slaves of Light. I was particularly fond of Ken'ichi as L. Replicating the huge, dark, round-eyed L of the anime would have been tough, even with a non-Asian actor, but Ken'ichi does a great job with posture, attitude, and L's idiosyncracies.

This is a continuation of the first Death Note film, btw. The hunt continues with the delightful twists and turns (in mortal and spirit realms) that will lead to the discovery of Kira and the vindication of L's suspicions. The finale is terrific.

This has been a truly quality story in various media--print, tv, film. I'd recommend them all, and certainly this flick.

For those unfamiliar with the Death Note world: The death note is a book (one of many) that are properties of the death gods (shinigami). One book per death god. But the death gods may allow the book to enter the human world and be used by mortals. There are rules that govern how it can be used to kill (and as Light, smart as he is, discovers, to control actions and outcomes). Write a name, that person dies, essentially. The story ends up being a tense, twisty cat and mouse game between two brilliant young men--L the detective, Light the killer--each trying to overcome the other. Two death gods play their parts, as well as a young woman who is emotionally bound to Kira (""killer""). A special team of officers are put together to bring down Kira. It turns out to be not at all easy, and things get really complicated, especially since the saying about absolute power turns out to be very, very true.

This is the way the manga should have been and this is the way I will see the series. The acting is great and the look of the film is beautiful, but the Shinigami still look bleh. The most shocking thing is that they made Rem a male?! I didn't like that, the character clearly looks female or maybe a Glam Rock Star. Besides that, I can't think of anything negative to say. This is Death Note done right with the finale we want (none of that L wanna be Near!)",1235433600,,560,4.008928571428571
3383571,5,B0015YVHX4,"Based on the manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide, ""Death Note"" the live action film makes its way to the US on DVD.

""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and another theme song ""Snow (Hey Oh)"" by the popular band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.

The sequel is the conclusion to the thrilling cat and mouse chase as the murderer Kira (Light Yagami, who has attained a large cult following for killing off criminals) tries to find a way to kill his nemesis, the top investigator in the police force known as L.  While L suspects Light Yagami as being Kira.

The film is 140 minutes long, pacing was indeed well done and overall, despite being different from the manga and anime series, both Shusuke Kaneko and Tetsuya Oishii managed to come up with a thrilling, dark and gripping storyline that remains faithful to the overlying theme of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is featured in 169 anamorphic widescreen and was originally shot in 35mm (1:85:1 ratio). My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk and Rem. And how that would translate on film and the two shinigami look exactly like it does in the anime and manga series but Rem seems to look more less detailed than Ryuk. But overall, the CG works with the film.

As for audio, the film is featured in both English and Japanese via digital 5.1 and 2.0 stereo. I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series. So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features in the film include the Death Note anime trailer, the Japanese and US trailer and Viz Pictures Presents.  The primary featurette is ""the Making of Death Note II"", a 23-minute featurette which includes interviews with the director and the main talent involved with the film.  Definitely good insight of what the talent felt about the characters and the challenges that they faced.  For example, Ken'ichi Matsuyama (L) having to constantly eat sweets.  He mentions that he had to do it so much that he couldn't tolerate it anymore and couldn't swallow.  He just spit it out after the shot.  Also, explanations by director Shusuke Kaneko on differences from the live film and the manga version.  Overall, a solid featurette.

""DEATH NOTE II: The Last Name"" was extremely popular in Japan.  Having been #1 in the box office for five weeks and earning 5.5 Billion yen in Japan, the film was indeed a success.

I enjoyed the film a lot and the pacing was much better with the second film but if anything was amazing, it was Tetsuya Oishii's screenplay.  It is challenging to get so much storyline from the manga and making a live action film.  There is so much story in the ""Death Note"" manga that it would be difficult to translate all that in two films.  So, there had to be major differences in the live film versus the manga and unfortunately, for many films based from a long manga series, they don't succeed because they try to condense everything into one film.

As for ""Death Note II: The Last Name"", Oishii manages to create a new storyline that is so different from the manga series but yet manages to stay within the confines of the main focal point.  Kira vs. L and finding a right conclusion.

Having the storyline so different from the manga, I was pleasantly surprised by it but by the film's end, I was rather pleased.  Both Kaneko and Oishii pulled it off.

What I love about this film is that Kira and L are two individuals who are intelligent and the way they try to outdo each other, is always amazing.  In a way, it's like a chess game between these two as they do what they can to outwit each other.

Also, I enjoyed seeing how many other characters were integrated into the overall storyline.  And knowing how different this film is from the manga and anime series, I was satisfied with the conclusion of the film and overall, I really enjoyed the sequel.  Good storytelling by Oishii and managing to pull of a storyline that is just as satisfying as the manga but yet quite different.

If you enjoyed the first live film, then you will definitely want to pick up the sequel.  ""DEATH NOTE II: THE LAST NAME"" is a thrilling, suspenseful and enjoyable film.  Highly recommended!",1234051200,18,4900,4.61361014994233
3383572,4,B0015YVHX4,"Far more a continuation than a sequel, ""Death Note: The Last Name"" follows the immensely popular and entertaining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>. The agile game of cat-and-cat continues between Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and L (Ken'ichi Matsuyama). Tables are turned, fortunes are reversed, and a new Death Note and shinigami comes into play.

The story continues almost exactly where ""Death Note"" left off. A young and popular idol, Misa, gets herself a Death Note and an accompanying shinigami, Rem. An devoted fan of ""Killer"", she decides to follow in his footsteps, even though she lacks the genius and finesse of execution. She is much more of an emotional wild card than Light's calculated style. L is still in hot pursuit, and he gets to show his stuff a little more in ""The Last Name"", demonstrating why he has the reputation he has. There are quite a few twists and turns, but the pace is good and the film never gets slow or bound up in it's own mythology.

All of the original cast has returned, including director Shusuke Kaneko. Matsuyama, as L, is particularly good, and it is no wonder that his performance spawned a spin-off flick ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Change-the-World/dp/B001CK0Z9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L: Change the World</a>"". The new shinigamis each have their own individual look and personality, and are animated well enough that you soon forget they are CG characters. Light is a little bit too steadfast, because we all know exactly what we would do if we had an admirer like Misa, but I guess that is the price you pay for being a cold, calculating genius/killer. Still, he is a man of absolute steel, as he shows more than once.

For fans of the comic series, it isn't the literal adaptation they might have been hoping for, but it is still an excellent series in its own right. ""Death Note"" and ""Death Note: The Last Name"" are both great flicks, and it is almost a shame to see them end. Live-action animation adaptations are rarely done this good.",1231718400,6,2142,5.350148367952523
3383573,4,B0015YVHX4,"Death Note is based on the popular manga (Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I've finally finished the anime series, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan in quite a while. I will review both films because  while the first film, which is indeed phenomenal and it can definitely stand on its own, the story is very much linked together. Suffice it to say, the live-action adaptation is better when seen one after the other, and this last chapter is what gives the thrilling saga of Light Yagami and the truly odd, sugar-devouring, detective called ""L"" its closure.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:
In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.

In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami (Death God), brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.
As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (super-sexy Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.

That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts absolutely--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?

Man has no right to play GOD.

This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films. Some may say that the film also contains a social commentary.

The battle of wits between L and Light Yagami is definitely one to watch; as the two geniuses struggle to stay one step ahead of the other. It is rather curious that such a complex match-up of intelligence also proves that the two are actually two sides of the same coin but on opposing sides. L is pretty much a charming if eccentric presence as the sugar-loving detective. I didn't know that sugar does provide energy for the brain until I observed him gulp down significant amounts of candy and dessert. The thing that proves Light Yagami quite dangerous is the fact that he believes that he is doing the right thing and whatever steps he has taken may seem cruel, it is justified. When one believes his cause his just, one becomes more determined than the common opponent.

Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual with a very solid structure. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is pretty intense, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass other films in terms of plot) I will stop here, since with this film, the less you know, the better it would be.

Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

This is a sort of alternative story that picks up where the first movie left off. I highly suggest getting the first before this one if you haven't already. And if you haven't seen this one, I'd say it's definitely worth it. The storyline differs slightly from the original Death Note series, and it's very well played out, until the rather shocking ending.

The acting is on par with the first part, which is to say flawless. Everyone holds their own even when the sparks fly between the Light and L.

The CGI rears its ugly head again. However, by this point, these movies aren't about the special effects; its about the cat-and-mouse chase starring the two leads.

This movie suffers from the Kill Bill Syndrome, which is that the follow-up to a great first half pales in comparison. I was let down by this final part.

3383606,5,B0015YVHX4,"Way back in 2008, my Sister and I discovered the anime franchise Death Note.  Every Saturday night we'd stay up until one in the morning just to catch the latest episode.  A little before I watched even one episode of the show, I saw an ad in Shonen Jump! magazine for Death Note II: The Last Name to be shown in select theaters for two nights.  After seeing that ad, I decided to give the show a watch with my sister, and you just read about how well that went.  A little into the first arc of the show, I bought the first film at Wal-Mart for five bucks.  We loved the film, and thought that, even if it did change somethings(all for the better), it was one of the best adaptations of another media to film.  We tried to find the second film, but Wal-Mart didn't have it.  We thought if we waited that it would show up, but we finished the anime and nothing ever showed up.  Cut to years later, and I buy this film.  We watched it last night, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  This film makes ever more alterations than the first, but all of them are good, if not arguably better than the source material.  Those that didn't like the second half of the anime/manga will probably find what they were hoping for here.",1373846400,,1219,4.233766233766234

The suspense and drama are both there. The guys they got to play L and Light fit the roles perfectly. Also if you don't want to read the subtitles the english dub uses the same voice actors that were in the anime. The plot digresses a bit form the anime. Other than a few details in the first movie mostly; this film follows the original story pretty well. In this sequel Light has joined the Kira investigation team. The 2nd Kira also appears. As we all probably know Misa is the 2nd Kira. She also possesses the Shingami eyes. They become a valuable asset to Light. this is the finale of the epic battle of wits between the 2 geniuses.

3383626,4,B0015YVHX4,"Now, the live-action adaptation ""Death Note"" 1 tried a few different twists and turns deviating from the original storyline, and this sequel is no different. The plotline covers the story of Light and Misa's confinement, but then afterward--during Light's and L's investigation into the Kira murders--weaves two characters from the anime/manga (the dedicated reporter and the psychotic corporate executive) into a single character's predicament of becoming Kira's new replacement. Why did the filmmaker's do this? Well, this film did surpass the 2-hour limit, which apparently is forbidden in filmmmaking everywhere, although there just isn't enough time to keep one interested, so squishing down the storyline feels necessary in this one. I personally prefer faithful adaptations, although this one did intrigue me as to what may come next since it was similar to the fantastic story of Death Note though it continually leave me surprised by its chanceful transitions in plot and style. If you already know the ending to Death Note, then wait to be surprised, because this ending is very different; not in an outlandishly bizzare way, but in an engagingly surprising way. If you have seen the anime, then you may notice a similarity in the English dubbing from Light's English voice actor in this one as in the anime, though I have yet to research it enough; however, his Japanese face actor commits to a heart-striking performance in the Ending. I actually prefer this movie over its predecessor, because the acting was all-around better and the storyline felt more reactive.",1282867200,,1577,5.237154150197629
3383627,4,B0015YVHX4,"First of all, I'd like to warn that for those who have not seen the movie, this review may spoil the plot. This applies even if you've seen the anime and/or read the manga. The reason (which is kind of a spoiler itself) is because the movie does not follow the plot of the anime or manga very closely. Various elements of the second half the original Death Note plot (as well as a few elements unique to the movie) are combined to create a new plot, which is much shorter and simpler. This new, and very different plot isn't necessarily bad, but I don't think it's quite as good as the original plot. I usually complain when movies mess up a book's plot but in this case, the plot was altered so much that I consider it to be separate but still complimentary to the manga and anime.",1282521600,,782,4.25503355704698
3383628,4,B0015YVHX4,"Death Note II: The Last Name continues the adventures of the characters from the previous film. In this sequel, Light, (Tatsuya Fujiwara ) the homicidal son of the local police chief, continues his deadly game of cat and mouse with L, the quirky computer genius who eats only sugary snacks. These two are both incredibly smart and motivated by their own inner demons.

Plot: Light has weaseled his way onto the Akira task force, seeking to hide his own tracks. (Light is a serial killer who uses a mystic book to kill criminals for the `greater good. Unfortunately, he also kills good guys if they get in his way). L is suspicious of him, however has no proof. To add fuel to the fire, another shinigami  Rem makes his presence felt and becomes the guardian of Light's new goth-lolita girlfriend. This shinigami has a conscience however and disapproves of Light and his tactics. Rem does something quite touching twice in the film, which made me really like this character, unfortunately he is no match for Light whose diabolical nature knows no bounds.

I really liked this film better than the first one, although I did feel that the devotion Light's girlfriend was a bit sickening, it added to the believability that Light was charismatic young man. I really liked Rem and hoped for a happy ending for him/her/it.

Overall, I felt this was better than the first film. It was good to see some resolution to the Light/L fight, and I really liked Rem who was a noble being.",1272585600,,1473,4.675675675675675

3383639,3,B0015YVHX4,"This movie is something of an oddity. On the downside, the plot is too convoluted, with numerous instances of the notes being swapped from one person to another and then back again, memories being lost and regained in the process, and new notes popping up out of nowhere. Some of the acting is a bit flaky, with characters breaking into hysterics one moment and then quickly accepting the appearance of Death Gods the next. The movie also implies that there are a lot of homicidal folks working in the Japanese media. But the main problem lies with the direction, which is too flat for such an imaginative source material. On the positive side it's engagingly quirky, it's always entertaining, it looks good, and the CGI is impressive. The story is ingenious despite its over-complexity, and there is never a dull moment. With stronger direction this could have been a great movie.",1241395200,3,881,4.841059602649007
3383640,5,B0015YVHX4,"This was a really awesome movie. I had the opportunity to catch it when it went in theaters for one night only, and it was well worth it (My friend and I actually cosplayed as Light and L). The dubbing was surprisingly good, with only a few awkward moments, and all in all, it was a very tense and gripping movie.

I loved how they stuck to the original ending (Won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it) from the manga and anime, even if they had to cut out an entire second season due to time constraints. I would've liked to have seen the psychological play between Light, Near, and Mello, but to be fair, the second season was dialogue-heavy, with not quite as many action sequences.

I only had one real gripe with the movie, and that was the character of Rem. The CGI was impressive and all, but what peeved me was the fact that in the movie, the shinigami was male. In both manga and anime forms, Rem was a female; I'll admit that it was rather unclear in the manga, but just watch a few episodes of the anime after Rem is introduced, and it's pretty clear.

All in all a fantastic continuation from the first Death Note film.",1241049600,,1136,4.274418604651163
3383641,4,B0015YVHX4,"A very well done conclusion to the film based off the anime series. The film makers did an outstanding job of putting the entire series in context with subplots and plots without confusing the person watching the film. It followed the anime series about 75%. The acting was superb by all actors involved. Even if you haven't watched the anime series this film does a good job on its own of explaining everything.

Couple gripes though...

1. REM the shimigami was female in the anime series not male as portrayed in the movie.
2. While the overall plot conclusion was the same as the anime several massive plot variations weren't followed, possibly due to movie time constraints. For instance in the anime series ""L"" was killed by REM via manipulation from Light. Also, one of light's own team members actually figured him out and defeated him with the help of Near. Light's Father also was killed in the anime series but he wasn't in the movie. While this isn't a big deal to some, these are major plot point that weren't transitioned to to keep it ""pure"".

Overall this was an extremly well done movie! I wish some Hollywood directors and screenplay writerswould follow novels, games etc as well as the makers of Death note movies did.",1240358400,2,1237,4.691244239631336
3383642,5,B0015YVHX4,"Great sequel to the first Death Note movie - picks up where the other left off, whips into hyper drive with an imaginative, complicated plot that really keeps you on your toes, and actually concludes with the Death Note notebook last name revealed. I wouldn't attempt to watch this sequel without seeing part one - you have to know the main characters, how they think, their relationship, etc., right from the get go in this part two. The story in infinitely more complex, with two gods of death and two Death Note notebooks, and more twists and turns how these death sentences using can be dealt using these notebooks. As before, the main story is the battle of wits between Light/Kira (Tatsuva Fujiwara), who vacillates between his evil Kira persona and innocent Light persona, and the mysterious ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama), the detective who's trying to put an end to all the deaths. These two brilliant young protagonists are playing a game of chess (both literally and figuratively) with each other, and the ending was pretty much a surprise to me. I'm not into Mangas, so I don't know if it's faithful to that story; I do know this movie is a really good supernatural thriller, and better than Death Note part one. The DVD has about a 20 minute ""Making of"" which was quite interesting - the director explained how the Manga had to be condensed and changed for the movie medium, each major actor had a say about their experiences (""L"" never wants see candy again!), and a neat movie wrap where everyone politely claps and bows respectfully to one another. You can watch the DVD with dubbed English, or Japanese with English subtitles. Great DVD rental if you like this type of genre.",1239840000,,1686,4.71864406779661
3383643,5,B0015YVHX4,If you enjoyed the mini series you will definitley enjoy the movie superbly done and you must see the part 1 then part 2.,1239062400,,121,4.083333333333333
3383644,4,B0015YVHX4,"This movie completes the Death Note conflict in a different way than the original manga, but the new ending is just as fulfilling and, in my opinion, a bit easier to follow. It's true Near, Mello, and others do not appear in the movie, but the fantastic spirit of the other characters more than makes up for it.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Death Note, and also to anyone who is just a fan of good movies.

[This is a minor personal input, but... watch the movie in Japanese with subtitles. Please. If only because Light's laugh at the end is ten times more Epic in the original than in the dubbed version.]",1238803200,,641,4.289256198347108
3383645,2,B0015YVHX4,the movie was decent at best but they went so far from canon that it wasn't really deathnote anymore. the only bright spot was that L won so we don't  have to put up with the inadequate heroes Near and Mellow.,1238716800,,209,4.097560975609756
