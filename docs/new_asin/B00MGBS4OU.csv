6577024,5,B00MGBS4OU,I got this for Christmas and just viewed the entire first two seasons in two days. I hadn't laughed like that in ages! One of the great comedies with every actor at the top of their game. Even my husband who tends not to laugh out loud was laughing with me. High praise indeed! It's a pity it is not yet available on Amazon in Seasons 3&4 on DVD. I will look elsewhere as this show should not be missed! It will always be a favorite. Great writing and acting-who could ask for more?,1453766400,3,482,4.138297872340425

6577036,5,B00MGBS4OU,"REV The Exes TVLand

TVLand struck gold with ""Hot In Cleveland"" and they have another remarkable hit with ""The Exes.""
As with ""Cleveland"", we know all the actors here. Kristen Johnson (3rd Rock, Adventures of Old Christine) Wayne Knight (Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, Hot in Cleveland) Donald Faison (Scrubs, Remember The Titans, Clueless) and David Alan Basche (The Starter Wife, Oh Grow Up, The War of the Worlds). In most sitcoms using actors over 30 is unheard of. TVLand has tapped into a vast, experience of talent that, 35 years ago was unheard of. The result is brilliant.

They spend money on sets, actors, writers and put us into today's world. Television for those over forty. Yet it teaches Gen X that life doesn't stop at 40. The subject of men who face life after divorce is not new; ""The Odd Couple"" was hugely successful, but ""The Exes"" characters are far more real yet at the same time the situations become hysterical and out of control, but never unbelievable.

Kristen Johnson plays a divorce attorney who, for lack of fulfillment, takes three newly divorced men, sets them up as roommates and guides them back into the world. Mismatched? Yes? Friends? Eventually. We see the amazing Wayne Knight as an on-line day trader couch potato, Johnson as an insecure, neurotic comedic genius. (Still hot, she's still willing to do anything for a laugh.)
Many of the guest artists are also well known faces from the past (Judith Light, Peri Gilpin, Don Rickles, Carl Reiner, Susan Lucci and many more.) and the writers hold back nothing in regard to making tongue-in-cheek jokes about past sit-coms. (How delightful when Carol Burnet said, Im so glad we had this time together. Or when Valerie Bertinelli speaks about how all the members of Van Halen didn't care much for David Lee Roth.) This is pure entertainment and, to this reviewer, it looks as though TV Land has stepped into a very warm and desirable market.

Check this out for certain. The first two seasons are on DVD for about $13.",1420848000,,1994,4.787790697674419
