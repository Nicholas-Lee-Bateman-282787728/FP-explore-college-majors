The music is Beethoven's first 6 symphonies, played here by the Berliner Philharmoniker under the legendary Karajan (though uncredited) in the 1960s.  Each painting is shown for about 16 seconds, with its title displayed at the bottom for about 3 seconds, a bit too short for my taste as I sometimes have to pause the video to see the title and artist information.

The video is presented in the NTSC 4:3 ""fullscreen"" format, with a fake, rather ugly picture frame around each painting, although I got used to it quickly and soon simply ignored it while looking at the pictures. The whole painting is shown first, then the camera zooms in a little bit to show some detail from the main part of the painting. The picture quality is actually good, with even lighting and smooth camera work. On my Yamaha upscaling DVD player (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yamaha-DVD-S659-DVD-player-upscaling-black/dp/B000KJK3DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yamaha DVD S659 - DVD player - upscaling - black</a>) hooked to my 1080p Sharp LCD TV, the pictures look clear with good resolution, if not exactly ""real-life""-like.

At this time there are two versions of this product being sold on Amazon, one with 3 CDs of the symphonies and one without. According to a flyer that came in the package, the set with 3 bonus CDs is the latest version.",1264982400,3,1840,6.2362204724409445
8503729,2,B001ETLY1A,"I think the concept behind this project is a good one, and I had a great expectation when I ordered the item. However, I was disappointed because the images of those beautiful pictures were so shoddy --- it looked almost as if the production team had used a home camera to film from some coffee table art books. Also the audio quality of the music playing was poor. Not only that, it doesn't even tell us the name of the orchestra or conductor at all! I gave 2 stars only because I thought the basic idea was a great one. I only hope some others pick up this idea and produce some beautiful product later on.",1221868800,3,608,4.25
