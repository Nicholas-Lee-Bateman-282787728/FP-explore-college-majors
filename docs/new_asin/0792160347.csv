134883,1,0792160347,"I thought that this movie was very dated, in other words, it wouldn't work today.
This movie was from 1980, but it felt a lot older to me.

I didn't understand why these rich married women would be seen in public, such as in their country clubs, with a ""male escort.""
If they wanted to have sex with Julian (Richard Gere), they could do it in a hotel or even in their house.
If they wanted to be taken out and if they wanted attention, then they could have done it where people don't know them.
Couldn't anyone they know see, at any time, and then tell their husbands, that these women were out with a 30 year old man?
I thought that the whole point was to be discreet - - but how could you be discreet if you are seen having dinner in your country club with a 30 year old man, which everyone seems to know is a male prostitute?

I found the relationship with Michelle (Lauren Hutton) unbelievable.
She sees him from across the room, realizes that he is a callboy, and hits on him.
She falls in love with him, but I honestly could not see why.
As Leon (the black pimp) said, Julian only cares about himself and doesn't feel anything for anyone else.
And as Michelle herself said, when he has sex, he just goes to work.
I couldn't believe that Michelle would throw her whole life away for Julian.
What did she expect would happen next?
Did she think that Julian could be faithful to her?
If he could, then how would the two of them support themselves?
Michelle said that she could not go home because she just gave Julian an alibi,
so how can we assume that she still has money to pay for his defense?

Julian said himself that he is getting older.
He cannot be ""in demand"" for too many years more.
What will he do when he can't sell his body anymore?
Was working as a chauffeur and a translator real work that he could support himself with?

We see Julian ""working"" all the time, but we don't see what he does when he is not working.
He said that he prefers older women, so are we supposed to believe that he really did fall in love with Michelle?

I found this movie very slow and very boring.
This must be the only movie that I have seen that was about sex that didn't hold my attention.

Richard Gere is, of course, attractive in this movie, but it is a shock to look him up on Google and see how he looks today.",1504396800,,2315,4.179372197309417

American Gigolo (1980). Paramount Pictures. Rated ""R"". Running Time: One hour, 56 mins.
Directed and written by Paul Schrader.

Julian Kay (Richard Gere) is a male escort in the Beverly Hills area. He is so experienced that his services are higher-priced. Wearing Giorgio Armani suits, he will only take rich women. No drugs. He drives to Malibu to visit Anne (Nina van Pallandt), who has a couple topless girls sun-tanning on her deck. Julian doesn't care about their nudity because he has some business to discuss. Anne wants him to escort a new female client. She is from out-of-town and needs a chauffeur. This is her first time. He wants a higher percentage, but Anne reminds him she needs a percentage too. Anne also reminds Julian he is neglecting his regulars. He tells Anne to get one of those high school drop-outs to do it. When Julian is told the woman does not do drugs, he agrees to 50/50 and takes the client.
  At home in the Hollywood Hills, Julian uses his gravity exercise boots that make him hang upside-down while lifting dumb-bells. He gets a call from Leon (Bill Duke) who needs him to fill in for Joey. He reluctantly agrees.
 He meets his first client of the day. She is wealthy. It is Mrs. Dubron (Carole Cook). He drives her to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Well, lets just say, he pops her cork.
He goes to a high-class, jacket-only restaurant and meets his next client, Michelle Joste (Lauren Hutton). He likes her at first. They both know French. But when he finds out she lives in Los Angeles, he decides to leave. He refuses her offer and tells her he doesn't do sex with the clients. He leaves her.
  On to his third call, this is the one Leon needed him for in Palm Springs. This was a rough trick and he did not like doing it. Later, he looks for Leon and when he finds him, he tells him he doesn't want to do his perverted kinks. There is some trouble ahead.

Also in the cast: Hector Elizondo, K. Callan, Carol Bruce, MacDonald Carey, Richard Derr.

134945,3,0792160347,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I had never seen this film and figured it would bore me, but after 36 years it is an historical record of the LA scene. I was enthralled with each street scene, home decor, wardrobe, and hedonistic simplicity just like when I first moved here.

Richard still looks better in dress whites but nice to see him sans gray hair. I think the Armani suits were classic but those dark shirts and light silver boots ruined the look imho. He is a very handsome lad and so very wholesome, just what the lady ordered I am guessing.

Most of the women they focused on for his tricks were absolutely stunning, why would they have to pay anything was impossible to imagine. Also it was hard to believe the two topless girls did not have huge implants, nice. Back then, $1000 for a 'date' appears to be astronomical, but like women in his profession, probably had to work with some nasty characters. So before AIDS, internet porn, 9/11, crazy RE prices, the lure of LA was sumptuous and hard to resist.

I found the script most tedious and un-engaging, but the test of time proved this was just a blip in honor of the preservation of life in LA back in the day.

High recommend for those of us who lost their Beta tapes of touring the town and a happy reminder of a simpler life. Beware of nostalgia!",1456617600,5,1326,4.395918367346939

you have both studio Logo's on the back cover, ridiculous
but both studios have done an extreme rush job releasing this on blu-ray
the old dvd version had no extras, just the Theatrical trailer
and poor widescreen Digital transfer with Dolby digital mix
and Guess what so does this new blu-ray reissue, exact same content as the dvd release, no new extras no nothing
all they have done is given the film a new HD transfer which probably looks like a dvd transfer
 & a 1.0 master audio mix & new cover art
i mean what's the point, waste of money i think
it makes you wonder why WB or paramount even bothered to release this film on blu-ray
if they're not going to make any effort adding new extras or giving a new 5.1 master audio mix to the film
like a new retrospective featurette with Richard Gere or Director Paul shrader
very very pathetic effort, this new blu-ray is not worth $1
there's many more old classics like American Gigolo been given the same treatment on blu-ray by WB or paramount
no new extras no Decent 5.1 master mix, alot of stupid Decisions being made at WB or paramount
keep your old dvd release of the film, this new blu-ray is worth nothing

135002,3,0792160347,"I wondered if seeing American Gigolo now, in late 2015 would engender different responses from what it did in me when I first saw it back in the day, so I went there.

It did not.

The movie is still compelling re distilled, super slick style, including the relentlessness of the Blondie driven soundtrack, but American Gigolo is also still cold and sterile at its core: badly written, sometimes verging on puerile and precluding suspension of disbelief;  badly directed, given the dearth of  believable affect in its two principals.  Well, except for the feast to the famine intensity of gigolo Julian trashing his apartment in frustration and search for planted evidence, and that went on far too long, tho his follow up dismantling/trashing his Benz in desperation, getting the stolen jewels had been planted somewhere in IT, worked.

But, in general, Paul Schrader who both wrote and directed this film, apparently couldn't differentiate between nuanced and subtle versus necrotic and pancake flat.  Not to mention, the final line uttered by Julian from behind glass in prison to Michelle, assuming it was not a joke, was wince-making.  A final insult, if you will.  And yet, Mr. Schrader also wrote the remarkable TAXI, which Scorsese directed, so he must be capable of writing a decent script.

I was, tho, reminded cars were beautiful then, and none resembled bloated waterbugs, which all have for far too long.  And Armani truly was singular back in the day.  I was also reminded that once, just fit in men was the ticket....before the armor of ripped and cut became the ticket.

But, for me, the greatest sin of all: the staged, stilted depictions of sexual intimacy were near anti erotic.  Did the director have a clue re what real, intense, subtle, mindless arousal is like viscerally?  Does he now? Did either of the two leads? Or were they simply victims of bad direction?

The only worthy message: anyone capable of selling sex, must, by definition, be emotionally shut down.  But in the fully realized film Klute, wherein Ms. Fonda plays a call girl, we can feel everything she is feeling on every level ongoing, including what she is working to obfuscate deep within herself.

No such privilege with this movie: Mr. Geres Julian is robotic, Ms Hutton's Michelle comes across as guarded and trying to emulate feelings rather than being fully present and feeling them.  To what degree these deficiencies owed to the actors versus the director is hard to determine.

All  in all, a glossy, ambitious but failed work, but even now, at least diverting.",1443312000,,2563,4.913953488372093

When I read that Travolta was to play Julian, I breathed a sigh of relief that he did not and Gere did. I loved Gere in some of his more off-beat roles like Mr. Jones and Intersection. I also love that he plays music himself in the films. He still looks sexy at age 65. As for the rest of this movie, I liked Lauren Hutton, she was so soft and pretty and a good contrast to the roughness of most of the other characters.  It was a cliche love story maybe, but I bought it.  I would've done that for Gere, too. Most women would on film. I first watched it when it opened in 1980 and even have it as a VHS tape.

I think the movie would have been better if he would have cried during some point of the movie.  He just seemed much too unemotional for somebody that age, in this profession.

135152,3,0792160347,"I've always thought Richard Gere to be a reliable actor. He gets the job done. So it is nice to see a very young Gere -- early in his career -- show the prowess and magnetism we witness in his films today. What is especially intriguing about Gere in Gigolo is that it foreshadows his role in Pretty Woman, which was made exactly 10 years later. Obviously, there is some role reversal, and the plot is quite different in terms of suspense vs. romance. But I cannot help comparing the movies to one another.

For one thing, another recognizable actor, Victor Elizondo, is in both flicks. Even though his parts are remarkably different, I get the same sleazy uncle vibe from him in each. Certainly, his characters are not such you either like or hate -- he's not a convincing enough performer for that type of distinction.

Both movies are love stories. Gigolo tries very hard the first hour and forty-five minutes resisting that categorization. So, as a romance, it fails. But what it lacks in romance it makes up in suspense. Although, I cannot say the murder mystery is as interesting as how Gere's beleaguered character handles himself throughout the story.

About Paul Schrader's direction. Not sure if I consider Gigolo to be ""stylized,"" as I see it described by some. Nothing about the movie is eye-popping or outside the normal mode of expression for the 1980s. Of course, one could argue that it ""set the tone"" for the decade. I don't have sufficient knowledge of filmmaking in the late 70s and early 80s to verify that.

Moreover, I question Schrader's decision to speed up the conclusion of Gigolo. There are a lot of fast-forward transitions (fade-out, fade-in sequences) at the end of the movie that clash with the steady pace of all but the final 15-20 minutes. I also question Schrader's frequent insertion of that catchy, but eventually annoying, ""Call Me"" song by Blondie. He even uses purely instrumental renditions. I was about to blow my brains out.

All that said, American Gigolo pleases well enough.",1400198400,2,2019,4.790229885057471

135161,3,0792160347,"I just watched American Gigolo for the first time.  Aside from the music, which was a bit much at times, the movie was an okay thriller.  The ending was a little disappointing (spoiler: were they going to set him free?), but overall it kept my interest throughout the movie.  The basic premise of the movie is that Geres character is being framed for murder and none of his alibis will collaborate his story.  Because of that he is forced to try to get to bottom of things on his own.  If youve never seen the movie, and don't mind a little nudity (male and female), you may want to give this one a chance.

135164,4,0792160347,"I really like everything about this movie--Well, almost everything.  The writing and directing are top notch, as is the acting.  The story and basic concept are still fresh over 30 years later.  This one has it all--except an ending.

The story of Julian, a top notch male LA prostitute (played beautifully by Richard Gere) is a complex story with many different sides and angles.  For almost two hours, the director builds Julian's story scene by scene.  Julian's story is built not so much with plot--this movie doesn't have much of that.  His story is based on how other's feel about and react to Julian.  Most of the film's ""plot"" occurs off camera, but that technique adds to Julian's isolated, lonely existence.  Of course, the other characters in the film (rich desperate women, heartless pimps, etc.) are just as lonely and isolated.  Julian is simply a carnival funhouse reflection of the rest of them and maybe of society in general.

American Gigolo deserves a better ending.  Of course, that's always going to be a problem for movies like this one.  Interesting, complex movies are always saddled with the problem of quickly wrapping up that which is seemingly unwrappable.  Some films deal with this problem better than others, but American Gigolo chooses not to deal with it at all.  The film simply stops.  One minutes we are up to our neck's in Julian's complex and rapidly deteriorating life, and the next minute the whole thing is over leaving most of my questions unanswered.  Such a fine fine deserves a much better ending.",1397779200,4,1543,4.873076923076923

135203,2,0792160347,"I can't figure out why people--guys especially--seem to hate Richard Gere so much. I don't think he's the greatest actor of his generation or anything, and photographed from the wrong angle, he can look kind of creepy, especially when he was younger. (He has aged gracefully IMO.) But when cast within his range, he's capable, charismatic and attractive, and he seems able to laugh at himself. So really, I don't get the hate and I didn't dislike ""American Gigolo"" because of Richard Gere.

Rather, I disliked ""American Gigolo,"" because it kept too much of a distance from its characters and its themes for the audience to engage with them. I had just read Joan Didion's ""Play It As It Lays,"" another indictment of the superficiality, materialism and spiritual deadness of affluent Southern California. That book was brilliant because its hard surfaces were fragile and you could reach in and touch its narrator's anguish. While writer-director Paul Schrader has done some great work (""Taxi Driver"" for instance), this story of Julian Kaye,  who sleeps with wealthy older women for money and gets caught in a web of suspicion after a client is murdered, never lets the viewer in deep enough to feel anything. You get subtle hints of Julian's malaise. He has stacks of pictures in his apartment that he flips through but never hangs on the wall. He expresses frustration that he can't do work other than be a male escort, but that doesn't even make sense because he shows a remarkable aptitude for learning languages. We know nothing of where he's from, what dreams he may have brought with him, or how or why he became what he is. Maybe his problem is that his ambition was misdirected in the first place and he thought having material stuff was all he would need to be fulfilled, but we never find out. He seems to have little in common, other than loneliness and physical attraction, with Michelle, the wife of an ambitious politician with whom he has an unpaid relationship (Lauren Hutton), so her enduring devotion to him and belief in his goodness doesn't make a lot of sense either.

Maybe the movie would have worked better with Julie Christie playing Michelle (she was in talks at one point), but I doubt it. I don't think the script would have given even the most gifted actors enough to work with. Schrader's analysis is fine, giving ""American Gigolo the potential to have been an excellent movie, but his directorial and scriptwriting choices left me cold.",1382054400,7,2467,4.813679245283019

135256,5,0792160347,"""American Gigalo"" made Richard Gere a movie star and brought male prostitution out of the closet and into the mainstream consciousness.

 Gere stars as Julian, a sexy and hunky man in his early twenties, living the high-life in Hollywood and working in the oldest profession knwon to man. His clients are older women who have tons of money, no men or couples, and he knows his career to a T.

 In the story Julian is set up for a murder of a woman and the only person who stands beside him is a woman very much in love with him, Michelle, played by beautiful Lauren Hutton.

 The film was a finanacial success making over $22,000,000 and critics loved the movie.

 Paramount also did a superb job in cleaning the film. The only extras are the trailer.

 One important sidenote: Richard Gere was the first Hollywood actor to show off his frontal parts in a movie, something most women and gay men have enjoyed!",1325462400,3,909,4.521472392638037
135257,5,0792160347,"This is a classic '80's flick directed by Paul Shrader who also wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver. To me, four films made Gere the icon he is today: Breathless, Looking for Mr. Goodbar, An Officer and a Gentleman, and this film, which Siskel and Ebert chose as one of their favorite films of the '80's.

Gere plays the title role in this film, well-dressed and well-schooled in the art of seducing old, rich, white women by his pimp who--in a reversal of the pimp-whore paradigm--is a female. Another pimp, a big black dude, played by Bill Duke has had his eye on Gere and wants him in his stable, although his gay, kinky, and often downright perverse clientele are not to Gere's tastes--yet. In a world of fake love, fake passion, sometimes even gigolos need love too.

I'll just leave it to that and not spoil this film for anybody who hasn't seen it yet. This film is a time machine: the clothes, the music courtesy of Blondie and disco--which was on its way out, the cars,Lauren Hutton, Bill Duke (who also played Abdullah in Car Wash, another classic).

135259,4,0792160347,"In my ongoing quandary to watch movies that define an era's unique style, I came across ""American Gigolo"" as a most suggestive one.  There are many things that stood out for me while watching this movie.  First and foremost, the fact that Richard Gere cast in the lead role appears to have been an absolutely perfect choice.  Not just because he is considered one of the sexiest men in Hollywood - an assumption I do not concur with - but because his inner egotistical sense shines through in this movie without quandaries.  Gere personifies to the ""T"" the typical selfish American Adonis who has achieved too much, too soon and in a far too easy way.  As such, he gets entangled in a web of deceit and murder, with everyone that he reaches out to turning their backs on him when he finds himself in desperate need of help.

He finds a kindred spirit in his leading lady, the epitome of American classic and easygoing style, Lauren Hutton.  Hutton plays the role of a politician's wife, too lonely and unhappy in her marriage, and in dire need of distraction and affection.  She meets Gere by chance in a hotel restaurant, when he assumes her to be French while he overhears her talking to the waiter in that language.  Ever ready for business, he approaches her with his debonair style but wants to withdraw as soon as he learns, (a) that she is married, and (b) that she is a local.  But Hutton goes after him, dons the classical trench coat and heads to his apartment overnight.  From then on, their sizzling encounters provide for some of the movie's plot.  The rest has to do with the murder of one of Gere's customers, and his implication in it.

Something that stroke me as very daring was the amount of nudity included in a movie that was filmed in 1980.  The shot of Richard Gere in full nude, with a far-sighted shot of his front genitals must have seemed quite a perversion for the time; as well as the close-up of Hutton's breasts being caressed by her lover.  Still, the nudity is tastefully done and never deviates into cheap porn.

This movie also put Armani on the map of general fashion, and one can seriously take a very good and quick lesson in stylish menswear by watching the scene where Gere puts together his suits for the week.  All of his outfits are pieced together with great care, and the fact that Gere's shape is probably his best ever adds much to the movie's appeal.  After all, who wants to watch anything other than gorgeous bodies in a movie that hits all the landmarks of Los Angeles, from the Beverly Hills Hotel to its beautiful beaches?",1302307200,8,2575,4.512931034482759

135261,4,0792160347,"This movie has grown on me over the years. The first time I saw it I was a teenager and at that time I really did not understand the movie. Now as an adult I can revele in the greatness of Paul Schrader's character, Julian Kaye. Simply put he is the kind of guy I've always admired. Confident, suave, intelligent and well-dressed. The man of the 1980s!

Some critics like Leonard Maltin have said that the movie is a bit too slow. Yet the slowness of pace allows us to get accustomed to the character and his lifestyle. Julian is a man who seems to have it all. Clothes, women a car a nice apartment. Yet despite all of the success he appears to have he is an extremely lonely man. Michelle Stratton, wife of a prominent politician, enters his life at the right time and they begin a torrid affair. Things get dicey for Julian when he is framed for murder and the story takes off from there.

I highly reccomend this movie and its similarity to later movies such as Light Sleeper (1992) and The Walker (2007) will be evident to any film buff. While I've seen Light Sleeper, I have yet to see The Walker; but I've heard it too is quite good.

American Gigolo, while somewhat dated today (See Julian's Tricks Get In Contact With Him Using 1970's Technology) still holds its own when it comes to dealing with the basic human emotions of love, lust, greed and envy and hatred. Bill Duke's role as Leon was fantastic. his ruthless portrayal of a gay pimp has yet to be matched by any other actor in any similar-themed film. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that this is a thoroughly enjoyable Four-Star film.

135263,3,0792160347,"'Taxi Driver' writer Paul Schrader wrote and directed this film about a male escort named Julian (Richard Gere) who romances a senator's wife (Lauren Hutton) and gets framed for murder. Besides the Scorsese classic, this is Schrader's second biggest credit. I've only seen a couple of his films as director, but I prefer him more as a writer. That isn't to say he isn't skilled behind the camera since this film does an excellent job of portraying a cold and shallow world of excess and consumerism and the even colder people who live in it. The story is intriguing and makes for a very suspenseful film. You feel as helpless as Julian as you wonder who could be framing him and why. Gere and Hutton are both good looking and each appear nude in the film. The best work though comes courtesy of supporting players like Bill Duke and Hector Elizondo. Duke is frightening as a shady pimp who contracts Julian for jobs catering to the kinky crowd. It is one of his clients who winds up murdered, so Julian naturally goes to him for help. He proves to be anything but loyal for  a friend. The single funnest performance is that of Hector Elizondo as Det. Sunday. Elizondo, chewing the scenery along with a giant cigar, is a hoot in his scenes with Gere. Sunday is in awe of Julian's hypnotic hold over women. In a clever plot twist, Julian agrees to trade style and grooming advice with Sunday for more lenient care when he becomes a murder suspect. The film builds to a surprising climax as we figure out who the murderer is and what happens to Julian. Boasting plenty of coke, Armani suits, and an amazing score from Giorgio Moroder the film is pretty entertaining but not the iconic 80's film I was expecting.",1251417600,7,1708,4.563517915309446
135264,4,0792160347,"""American Gigolo"", like Julian Kaye, the titular gigolo played by Richard Gere, has a shimmering surface, but underneath that thin veneer lies nothing but shallow narcissism. Released in 1980, it really captured the zeitgeist of that era; you could call it the quintessential film of the 80's.

Julian Kaye is most passionate when he is perfecting that surface. When he is exercising, hanging upside down from weird high tech boots while simultaneously learning to speak Swedish from instructional tapes, he is a dedicated and disciplined soldier. While sorting through his wardrobe, picking the perfect combination of tie, shirt, and pants to perfect his ensemble, he is truly alive.

The rest of the time he is whining about being misunderstood, but it was impossible to understand what he was saying, half the time. He would either be mumbling, whispering -- or SHOUTING! I can only speculate on what some of the dialogue was, but Julian Kaye was always complaining, always kvetching, and always trying to negotiate a better deal. Even when he meets Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton), a Senator's wife and his ostensible love interest, he protests that he is not that kind of girl. She puts it bluntly:

--------------
Michelle Stratton: How much?
======================

She has already figured out what kind of girl Julie is; now they are just haggling over the price.

At least she appreciates him. No one else seems to. When he finally uncovers who has been trying to frame him for a murder, he asks them, 'why me?'

""Because you were framable. You've stepped on too many toes. Nobody ever cared about you. I never even liked you much myself.""

It is hard for the audience to care about him, too. That makes it hard to connect with the film apart from the dazzling surface.

Though set in Southern California, there's a European look to the film's mise en sc&egrave;ne, due to superb production design by (unaccredited) Ferdinando Scarfiotti. The celebrated designer is best known for his work with director Bernardo Bertolucci. Scarfiotti lacked a guild card, and was not credited for his work, but in a film that stresses style over substance, he can't be credited enough. It is the look of the film, more than the content that stays with you.

When Julian gets behind the wheel of his very expensive and stylish automobile with ""Call Me"" by Blondie blasting on the soundtrack, you get a taste of what it feels like. Giorgio Moroder, best known for his work with disco diva Donna Summers, wrote the music and had Deborah Harry write the lyrics. Before Harry came up with the 'Call Me' hook the track was called ""The Man Machine."" She really nailed the concept and the whole song was finished quickly, and then rerecorded with her band, Blondie. Her voice is a perfect fit. The ""Call Me"" musical motif continues throughout the film, and some of the soundtrack was even composed by the director Paul Schrader and Moroder.

For all the influence this film had, the murder mystery at its core is very weak. Director and writer Paul Schrader lacks the knack for this sort of genre, it seems, though his script for ""Taxi Driver,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, certainly generated plenty of suspense. Schrader is no Hitchcock, that's for sure. Still, there was a certain je ne sais quois about the film that captures an era, the dawning of a new and decadent decade that was the 80's.

135265,4,0792160347,"A slick L.A. callboy finds love & redemption in Paul Schrader's ultra-stylish drama. High-living prostitute Julian Kay (Richard Gere stepping in for John Travolta) has it all: the Mercedes the clothes access to Beverly Hills' swankiest establishments and a stable of rich older female clients, but it all falls apart after he does a favor for his former pimp (Bill Duke)and the trick turns up dead a short while later; Julian's actual client won't give him an alibi and police Det. Sunday (Hector Elizondo) doesn't believe the gigolo's denials.

The one person who can help him is frustrated politician's wife (and sole non-paying bedmate) Michelle (Lauren Hutton) if only Julian could let down his defenses and accept her gesture of love. Mixing his admiration for European art cinema with a voyeuristic view of the seamier side of sex & affluence Schrader renders Julian an inscrutable emotionally disengaged purveyor of pleasure decked out in Giorgio Armani clothes coordinated with Ferdinando Scarfiotti's meticulous production design & lots of graphic nudity.

Amid critical doubts about its artiness and distanced eroticism AMERICAN GIGALO surprised everyone by not dying on the box office vine when it was theatrically released in the Winter of 1980 with some audiences reportedly showing up for repeat viewings of Gere's seductive charms it became a moderate hit turning Gere into a star and Armani into the new fashion sensation.

Whatever reservations one may have about the movie it provided two indelible images of 1980s decadence to come: Gere's perusing his artist's palette of shirts ties and jackets and Gere's cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in his convertible to the New Wave strains of Blondie's ""Call Me"".

Therefore, with nobody to help Julian, he ends up in jail awaiting trial for the murder, but when all seems lost, Michelle risks her own reputation and her husbands to provide Julian with the alibi that can save him from going to prison.",1229385600,3,1972,5.153125
135266,3,0792160347,"I was weary of turning the volume up and down during this movie.  Richard Gere is either mumbling or yelling.  Lauren Hutton was whispering the whole time. Although I thought she was great for the part, with her androgynous looks that would appeal to a line-straddler such as Julian Kaye, she needed more acting lessons.  She appeared nervous -- more nervous than her character required. I would have liked to see Julian with one of his older clients, doing what he apparently does best.  The movie got it backwards -- older women, it seems, want to be sexually noticed, and the younger women want someone who will listen to them.  Gere goes on and on about older women and the pleasure he gets from giving them pleasure, but all you see is him safely escorting older women, as a gay pal might do for any gal.  Gere has that ability to be both low-class and yet convey to others that he believes he's superior.  I'm surprised that Swedish madam didn't wring his neck and dump him in a bay. I just love the stupid scene in which she's not paying attention to her child with whom she gets only visitation, and Gere comes up with something like a ""Hey, kid,,"" and throws his ball to another area as if he were a fetch dog.  And the poor kid character runs after it. Just an upscale version of the strippers who have their kids backstage, being watched by God knows who.  It's seedy as all get-out, with great clothes. Hutton has the best wardrobe. I would have liked to see more development of why her character and Julian Kaye fell in love.  She makes it clear that it isn't the sex.  She seems to portray a depth that Kaye can't match, so what does she see in him to warrant love? Something shared, something more revealing would have been interesting. Was his last line really, ""It took me so long to come to you?""  I couldn't hear well because of his mumbling.  But if so, that is hilarious, considering his earlier speech of how long it took him to help an older woman to orgasm.",1225152000,4,1981,4.40934065934066
135267,4,0792160347,"I like American Gigolo.  It's a simple film to watch, and a film that wouldn't be out of place in a made for TV movie line up today (Scandal!  Sex!  Drugs!  Politicians!).  Naturally, the main reason to watch this is Richard Gere who was up and coming ala James Dean, and vital eye candy at the time.  It would take him a few more years to be taken seriously as an actor but there's a wicked pleasure in watching Richard Gere fit this role perfectly.  It feels like he's working the audience, the camera and the characters in his own movie world.  The gigolo role is tailor cut for him, just as the Armani suits are.  I'm a Lauren Hutton fan too but the real reason to watch this noir piece is for Mr Gere.  And Blondie's soundtrack hit of course. Any analysis past this is pointless.  Enjoy the 80s.",1221177600,,800,4.266666666666667

135271,3,0792160347,"This is one movie that grew entirely from its failings into one of the most influential movies of the last 20 years. How could the director of ""Taxi Driver"" blow it? The ingredients were in line: attractive stars: Model of the decade, Lauren Hutton; Richard Gere, Slim Von Wink;supporting cast,Hector Elizondo, Latino on the rise, Bill Duke (future director)and the blond near-actress tied to Howard Hughes, Nina Von whatever. The movie rides entirely on the surface, two wheels instead of four on the ground. Slick, teasing. Innuendos,political smear. The screenwriter could not tie the pieces together into a cohesive drama. You didn't know whether it would be a political thriller or a fashion thriller. The clothes, the glitter and gloss blend with the gross. You had as much concern for Gere's fate as his choice of wardrobe at the end. Let the music play, end of movie. Made you want to shop forever. All wrapping.

135273,4,0792160347,"American Gigolo is one of my favorite films and yet it is really not one of the greatest films that you might encounter. Shot in rich tones, particularly blues and greys, the director, Paul Schrader, wants us to know that we are not going to be afforded the opportunity to get to know the characters too well. One might be able to argue that American Gigolo was one of the films that literally catapulted the movie going public into the 1980's mindset of materialism.

Richard Gere in one of his earliest films, protrays straight male call boy, Julian, who is tops in his game. Julian is gorgeous and knows many gorgeous women. He sleeps with those who will pay him. He doesn't bother with those who won't. Julian's lifestyle is one of everything ""is a means to an end"". He is interested in beautiful clothing and looking good, but because it helps him get something that he wants. He enjoys artwork and stylish digs, but not because he loves them, but because they are status symbols for his success. Julian enjoys being a gigolo because he is the best there is. He wouldn't (and doesn't) enjoy it when it isn't on his terms. For someone like me who feels he is too in tune with his emotions, Gere's Julian is cool, calculating and enviable. He goes about life without a care for anyone but himself.

When Julian meets Lauren Hutton, he is actually smitten with her. This is evidenced by the meeting taking place in a bar with deep reds and comfortable upholstered booths instead of the abounding greys, blues, and steel evidenced elsewhere in the film.

When Julian finally becomes intimate with Hutton and allows his emotional wall down for a moment, Schrader pulls us in close, but just afterward he lets us see that Julian can't maintain such intimacy and the camera pulls back for a long shot of him as he gets out of the bed leaving Lauren Hutton alone in the bed.

The story is secondary to the style of the film. It is a thriller, but not an exciting one. The music of Georgio Moroder and Blondie complement the film and give it even more atmosphere. It needs it because the films two false endings drag this picture out longer than needed in trying to show us how emotional involvement can change someone. The message should be left that a lack of emotion can be dangerous.

I rewatch this film every so often. It's a guilty pleasure watching the opening of the film with Julian driving down the PCH in his 450SL. Or when he's laying out different Armani outfits determining which to put on. Or looking at paintings, never deciding where he will hang them.",1105574400,32,2566,4.557483731019523
135274,3,0792160347,"This film is stylishly shot and poorly acted, and paced at about the speed a rich old woman might utilize to putter about the perfume section of Neiman Marcus.
I think it would have been more interesting if Julian had been an amnesia-suffering killer who, after his rich senator's wife angel rescues him from prison, murders her, too, and then goes back to turning gay tricks on the ""bad side of town."" But that didn't happen.
A lot of male/female dialogue in this movie is truly cringeworthy, and the funniest line to me is when Julian's lawyer tells him ""The maid saw you try and rescue Leon, so they're not going to prosecute on that"" after Julian pushes the guy off a twelfth floor balcony. That's like shooting someone and then being let off because you put a pillow under their head while they died. I also found it peculier that in a sprawling city of ten million or so people where supposedly no one ever leaves their car, characters keep running into one another on city streets and shops.
All in all, a good snapshot of wealthy LA on the cusp of the eighties, but there really isn't much more to be gleaned from this movie than that.
One note on the sound quality of the DVD. The dialogue is very hard to pick up at times, which forces one to turn up the volume quite high. This gives the viewer an unpleasant jolt whenever the pounding Moroder tunes come in, because they are recorded very loud. Be warned.",1066780800,7,1417,4.453846153846154
135275,3,0792160347,"The significance of American Gigalo is capturing the mood of the disco movement in its waning days, and not of a compelling story line that draws you in.
The story line itself is weak, as other reviewers have already panned it.  A gigolo is framed for murder, set up by him pimp.  Living the cream of life in its riches on his good looks, a murder accusation send his good life down a spiral.  Along the decent, he picks up the love of a prominent politician's wife, who becomes his savior and true love, perhaps for the first time in his life.
What makes American Gigalo fun is capturing the last breadth of the disco movement, of the lifestyle of when casual sex was safe, drugs were no big deal, and the music was still dance-able.  This was the film that made Richard Gere the movie icon that he is today.
Watch this movie for a trip down memory lane, but don't expect a great story out of it.",1061683200,3,897,4.289940828402367
135276,4,0792160347,"As would FLASHDANCE, AMERICAN GIGOLO helped to set the tone for the nascent 80's, though not to the extent that the former movie ultimately would. Nevertheless, as we watch, we see that emerging decade called the 80's unfold.  Clearly disco was on the way out and new wave was on the way in, as evidenced by the soundtrack and fashions of this film.  Also, you will see portents of the Miami Vice look that would become all the rage five years later. AG probably represented the last bastion of promiscuity and homosexual activity that flourished free of the threat of AIDS. The disease, if it did exist in that day in age, was probably so obscure that it wasn't even discussed even among those in the medical community. AG is the story of Julian Kaye, played by a painfully young-looking Richard Gere, a high-priced male prostitute who services the older, wealthier women of Beverly Hills.  Handsome, well-paid, sophisticated, and intelligent -- he is conversant in several languages -- he seems to live an enviable life of privilege and ease. He remains emotionally unattached to the women he comes in contact with until he catches the eye of a cool blonde named Michelle, played by Lauren Hutton.  She appears to be his equal in every way, but there is a cloud of mystery that surrounds her that Julian can't quite fathom.  They part, and he doesn't expect to see her again until she unexpectedly shows up at his apartment.  They spend the night together and come to the conclusion that they are in love. Julian discovers Michelle is the wife of a prominent Senator shortly after he's asked to fill in for a fellow prostitute's gig. The assignment is to pleasure the wife of a million-dollar businessman.  To Julian's horror, he reads of this woman's murder a few days later in the paper.  His pampered existence is tainted by this tragedy.  As his and Michelle's clandestine love flourishes, he realizes that he's being framed for a murder he didn't commit.  Who is doing this to him and why are reasons he can't figure out.  In vain he tries to obtain an alibi from friends and acquaintances, only to have them withhold help.  Then one is promised to him by Leon, a fellow prosititute, but he has his own reasons for vacillating which come to light later in the film.  Michelle wants desperately to help him, but she has everything to lose and absolutely nothing to gain by providing an alibi. The plot takes a few twists and turns as the film comes to its surprising conclusion, but one thing that's never made clear, or perhaps I wasn't paying attention, is where exactly Julian was on the night of the murder.  It's obvious that he's innocent, but where was he?  He may have spent all or part of that night with the wealthy woman who, along with her husband, repudiates him, but I'm still not sure.",1053561600,2,2806,4.651821862348178
135277,4,0792160347,"""American Gigolo"" is high on my list of Guilty Pleasures. This 1980 thriller wallows in the troubles of the rich, the infamous and the decadent. Its main characters have too much money, which can be a good thing, and too much time on their hands, which can be a very bad thing. There is a sort of perverse pleasure in watching them sort through their various problems, most of which are indirectly of their own making. Writer-director Paul Schrader has always cast a cynical eye on human endeavors. Sometimes, his insights have been absolutely brilliant. [He wrote both "" Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"".] But even when he is playing around, as in ""American Gigolo"", he creates for us an interesting world, which can also be repellant because we see a certain amount of truth in his characterizations.
Richard Gere is Julian Kaye, a very well paid [and apparently well educated] LA hustler. His specialty is wealthy, older women. Arrogant and self-assured, he has made his share of enemies in his shadowy world, especially among his pimps. Things get complicated for him when he falls for Michelle Stratton [Lauren Hutton], wife of a prominent political figure. But far worse is in store for him after a client is murdered and Julian becomes the number one suspect.
Giorgio Moroder contributes a lively musical score - very 80s. John Bailey's cinematography is first-rate. He captures the vanity and vulnerability of Julian right from the opening shots, for example.
This is one of those movies that has more detractors than admirers. To me, it is wildly entertaining in a dark comedy way. Its one big fault is a contrived happy ending, which is diametrically opposed to the tone of the rest of the movie.",1031443200,22,1704,4.859106529209622
135278,5,0792160347,"Richard Gere is remarkable as a Male Prostitute in this gritty, but glamorous protrayal of a fella that's lookin' for love in all the naughty places!
I like the crime story element much more than the love story between Mr. Gere and Ms. Hutton...But mostly I like that a typically female role (especially in main-stream cinema) was played by a great leading male.
Recommend this as a Double Feature with Pretty Woman (although I'm not a fan of Pretty Woman for film sake...it's good to see Richard turn the tables on his life...Imagine it as a Prequel to Pretty Woman. It'll give the storyline a whole new spin!!)",1018915200,2,612,4.675925925925926
135279,4,0792160347,"Let me begin by saying that I believe Paul Scrader is the greatest screen writer of all time. Why? Simply bacuase no other filmmaker has expressed the human truth of man's existence so well. No, he is no expert on women - but he does know men.
THE BAD - American Gigolo's plot nowadays plays like a porn plot unfortunately. So, it hasn't aged well. The character of Detective Sunday for instance, is distractingly artificial. I believe unintentionally so. The costume design is exquisite for Gere, but ridiculous for the detective. Additionally, the film has been somewhat unimaginatively directed by Schrader, considering it against some of his other masterful efforts. Take the ludicrous love scene with Gere/Hutton, clearly a failed homage piece.
THE GOOD - The film has an incredible sensibility about it. A very cool edge, in many respects. The performance of Gere is still today a landmark for him. Not as successful as its forebearers, but still a fascinating study of a man dealing with artificial relationships - he struggles with his homosexuality (Schrader delved into the gay underworld at this time, without actually being gay). Ultimately, it is the intimacy of love with Michelle, that allows Julian Kaye to find peace. To explore the gay subtext perhaps read Peter Biskind's ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"".
FINALLY - please consider this film alongside its Schrader counterparts. The Amazon review is INCORRECT in fact, this is not part of a trilogy, it is part of a tetralogy, as said by Schrader in a Film Comment interview.",1017100800,4,1539,5.015625
135280,3,0792160347,"This is one of two breakthrough films for Richard Gere.  The other one was ""Officer and a Gentleman"", which cemented his status as a bankable star.  This is also an early film for mega producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, ConAir, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor).  In this film, Gere plays Julian Kaye, a gigolo who services the sexual needs of wealthy older woman.  One of his tricks gets murdered and suddenly all the evidence points to him.  Of course, his alibi refuses to admit he was with her because it would be scandalous.  The last half of the film is devoted to Julian trying to discover who is trying to frame him.  Concurrent with this plot is the story of his love affair with Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton) the wife of a wealthy Senator.
The story isn't bad, but the dialogue is mindless and trashy, typified by Michelle's repeatedly begging for sex from Julian in the most profane and explicit terms.  There aren't any surprises that aren't completely predictable, and the mystery of who is framing Julian is painfully obvious.  The film features Blondie's hit ""Call Me"", but after hearing a couple of dozen Georgio Moroder variations on this theme on his synthesizer, it gets tiresome.
Gere's performance shows promise here and his generous nude scenes make this film a favorite among his female fans.  Gere exudes a smart and sophisticated machismo in this film that would be his trademark for years to come.  For Lauren Hutton, who was more famous as a Supermodel than an actor, this role is probably her most notable.  She does an adequate job of playing the aristocratic wife with an untamed libido, but is in no danger of winning any acting awards.
This is an interesting film to watch from a historical perspective if you are a Gere fan, but it is by no means a classic.  I rated it a 6/10.  Weak writing hamstrings a decent story and keeps it from rising above mediocrity.",1012953600,3,1922,4.732732732732733
135281,5,0792160347,The plot and characters of this stylish film are just an excuse for displaying a certain type of life style.  The movie is really cinematic in its original big screen vibrant colors (subsequent releases in VHS tapes and DVD are truly disappointing with rather pale and dull colors).  This film is a must see for any eligible bachelor who wants some ideas about the right clothes and furniture.  The sound track is superb and this is one of those movies that make LA and its various neighborhoods look very very cool indeed!,1006041600,2,523,4.663043478260869
135282,1,0792160347,"This movie was not sexy, it was boring and it just went on forever(all those fade outs and fade ins at the end got on my nerves-enough already director-time to yell - that's a rap!).Actors(especially Gere and Hutton)  talk as if they are heavily medicated on some type of pain pills. Sex  scenes are not even sexy of this type of film genre. I think a  happier-""GRADUATE"" type of ending would have improved picture  somewhat. The music is the only reason I give this film one star because as  a big eighties music fan and since I was in J-High and H-school during this  period I have a personal bias towards Blondie, otherwise don't waste you're  time with this dud of a picture.",961804800,5,679,4.471544715447155

135284,4,0792160347,"American Gigolo is probably writer-director Paul Schrader's most memorable film. Richard Gere is perhaps too well cast as a strutting, smug hustler brought low by his egotism and blindness to the reality of his life. The  love story ""redemption"" centering around Lauren Hutton is pure  front-office placation. The real subject of the film is exactly the sexy  surfaces the story somewhat hypocritically pretends (but not too strongly)  to condemn.
In fact, the film's most memorable sequences are both  dedicated to hard-edged commodity glitter and have nothing to do with the  love story. In the opening credits, Gere shops on Rodeo Drive then drives  down Pacific Coast Highway. Deborah Harry loudly sings out to ""Call  Me"" in the background, Gere smirks in the sunny breezes behind the  wheel of his 450SL, while the camera lovingly caresses the bumpers and hub  caps. In the famous dressing scene, Gere throws one exquisite jacket, shirt  and tie after another on to his bed as he ponders the most effective  combination. Both scenes are wonderful evocations of svelte narcissism,  cheeky self-satisfaction made into an art.
To achieve these surfaces,  Schrader owes a deep debt to cinematographer John Bailey, fashion designer  Giorgio Armani and especially ""visual consultant"" (production  designer) Ferdinando Scarfiotti, who is probably chiefly responsible for  the film's famous ""European"" look. It also doesn't hurt that the  story is almost exclusively limited to the sleeker parts of LA and Southern  California-Beverly Hills, Westwood, Malibu, a side trip to Palm Springs,  with a touch of Hollywood grunge thrown in for some kicks and kink. It all  adds up to a creamy, pastel-tinged vision of LA as a show-biz Riviera,  where class and style don't come from centuries of breeding, but can be  purchased for the price of a designer shirt.
It is not too much of an  exaggeration to suggest that the unsympathetic, vacant characters and  ludicrous plotting are there to wear the clothes. Intentionally or  otherwise, that hits at a truth about LA that makes the film stay in the  memory (particularly since life in the city has changed little since it was  made). It's not just the combination of the sleazy and the silky, the  cooled-out camerawork gazing alternately at rot and luxury, but the film's  realization that in LA, ""How much?"" is not just the beginning of  a financial transaction, but the only question of value people understand.",960163200,91,2456,5.141772151898734

135286,3,0792160347,"It has been sufficiently praised the whole crew's work in Schrader's interesting thriller, not to mention the filmmaker's ability to deal with an expensive production (headed by recent Armaggedon's self proclaimed pop  corn movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer.) It was all in the screenplay. Even  though Schrader had made his directorial debut a couple of years before  ""American Gigolo"", with ""Blue Collar"", his career had  been catapulted by the happy writting experiences with ""The  Yakuza"" (directed by Sidney Pollack) and, above all, ""Taxi  Driver"", movies that dealt with characters that seek some form of  redemption, particularly thoughout violence. This seems interesting when  Schrader's biggest influence has been (along with Martin Scorsese) outcast  french filmmaker Robert Bresson. In the fifties, this auteur was forced to  manage sounds and acting in a totally different way as it was never before  done in world cinema, avoiding theatrical performances and camera movements  that could distract the audience from the stillness and the subtle vitality  of the actors. (In fact, Bresson denied the use of the word  ""actor"", and prefered ""models"". He said that, as a  director, he wasn't interested in what the model could show, but in what he  could hide, pretty much as in real life: we are always careful not to show  all aspects of our personalities). Therefore, his work, that portrays so  vividly that ""inaccesibility"" have stood the test of time. When  Paul Schrader was a film critic, he lounged for a new kind of cinema that  would express feelings with concern, honesty and craftamship. It was when  he saw Bresson's film ""Pickpocket"" that, he confessed, he could  not write about any other film. Bresson's movie narrates the misadventures  of a would be burglar who uses his time and his energy in robbing people's  money, putting it into practice as an art. In the story, there are also a  girl and a policeman, and in the end, the main character ends in jail only  to realise, in an unforgettable finale, that he has fallen in love. When  ""American Gigolo"" was released it was no secret that Schrader had  planned some sort of homage for his movie hero. Concessions were made of  course, and the stylish production of the misadventures of a male  prostitute, in a story that includes a policeman and a girl, were met by  favorable reviews that took ""American Gigolo"" as ""the  portrait of a 'call boy' as a bressonian victim"" and negative points  of view as well. One of these critical reviews considered, not without  justification, that the ending of ""American Gigolo"", which  practically is the same of ""Pickpocket"", was redundant and  vulgar. Schrader had made a thriller about an existencialist crisis, about  the urge for a spiritual exit (simbolized by the unconditional love of the  senator's wife for Richard Gere's character, Julian, who, by the way, is  very convincingly acted) and, therefore, about the pursuit for purity.  Beauty and purity are what the main character of ""Pickpocket""  looks for (in the strangest way: through crime), and ultimately finds it  with unconditional love. But the final sequence in Schrader's film doesn't  quite fit with Bresson's theme in ""Pickpocket"", where, due to the  repetitive images, subtle performances, and strategic extracts of music,  the final redemption throughout pure love goes right to the point.  ""American Gigolo"", with its comercial looks, its performances  (which are far from the austerity of Bresson),and one or two images of  sexual abandon (between Julian and the senator's wife) which I find of very  poor taste, sums an interesting display of hollywood professionalism that  could have turned into a cheesy movie, if it wasn't for Schrader's genuine  affection and enthusiasm for cinema, and Robert Bresson. If any of you is a  fan of Schrader's movie, and gets a chance to see ""Pickpocket"",  don't miss it. It's interesting to establish a comparison between the two  movies, even more when ""American Gigolo"" is a worthly effort to  watch.",953510400,5,4034,5.132511556240369
