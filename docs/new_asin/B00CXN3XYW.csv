8587261,4,B00CXN3XYW,"Still good, but not quite the same experience as it is in the game. Basically, they took all the in-game cutscenes and meshed them together to form one long movie, with Akane narrating (in Japanese) the parts of the game that they skip over. As a result, it feels as though there's a lot of stuff missing from it. There's not a good sense of how the time passes, and there's not as much character development as there is in the game. Those who haven't played the game might be left with a feeling of ""How in the world did they come to this conclusion?"" Also, the voice-over narration sometimes covers up the cutscene dialogues to the point where you miss some of what they're saying.

That said, as someone who has played through most of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it, I give this movie 4 stars. It's still good after all these years.",1382400000,,839,4.412903225806452
8587262,1,B00CXN3XYW,"The movie is just a collection of all the cutscenes from the game.  I knew that before I bought it, but I read that there were new scenes created to make the story more cohesive.  I was hoping for some added CG sequences along the lines of Final Fantasy: Advent Children, but there was nothing of the sort.  I may be wrong, but I think the only thing they added was additional dialogue to help explain the story.  I'm a big Onimusha fan.  So I decided to blind buy this DVD.  Terrible decision.  One I'm hoping to save others from.",1380585600,4,531,4.25
