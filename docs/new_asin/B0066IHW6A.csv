8563110,3,B0066IHW6A,It's unfortunate that the author isn't too conversant in English. Plus the sound volume is too low to make what he said understandable. This DVD is a seminar where much time was spent trying to make himself understood by the foreign students. A pity because clearly Lee Yun Fook is an expert in Hung Gar. It would be excellent if he could make instructional DVDs on Hung Gar Kung Fu. I would be among the first to purchase them.,1364428800,,428,4.430379746835443
