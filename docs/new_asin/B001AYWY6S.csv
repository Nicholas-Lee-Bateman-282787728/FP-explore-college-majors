I personally enjoy the closing song of the movie. This is a must see movie!!! enjoy.",1223769600,3,257,4.733333333333333
3474909,5,B001AYWY6S,This movie is fun to watch and inspiring too!,1408665600,,45,4.111111111111111
3474910,3,B001AYWY6S,A good family move. I enjoyed watching it with my kids.,1407456000,,55,4.090909090909091
3474911,5,B001AYWY6S,This was purchased for my 9 year old granddaughter.  She is a soccer player and really enjoyed this movie.  The story line was a little far fetched but it brought many laughs.  Our family watched this together and it was liked by all ages.,1390089600,,239,4.386363636363637
3474912,3,B001AYWY6S,"Good movie to watch with the kids. As with any movie if you have an imagination,the story works and entertaining.",1367625600,,113,4.7
3474913,3,B001AYWY6S,It was funny. It was a little mature for younger kids. I would suggest kids be at least 13 years old before they see it. It was pretty entertaining as a whole. I give it three stars.,1366761600,,182,3.945945945945946
3474914,3,B001AYWY6S,"Predictable, low production values, acting is pretty good. A great movie for my soccer loving 11 year old girl. Annoying sequences of soccer games: the ball changes instaneously as does the weather and the editing is VERY choppy. A lot of close in shots of girls' cleats running around.",1349827200,,286,4.857142857142857
3474915,2,B001AYWY6S,"Some reasons why I dislike this move and think it typical of white-American film:

1. The white man was a perfect father and husband
2. ONLY reason a white mother could ever be single is because her husband died.
3. White mom is a good mother b/c she runs herself ragged trying to please her spoiled teenager
4. Black couple is divorced (at least they were married in this one)
5. Black female is angry/bitter at her ex-man
6. Black man is a jerk and poor excuse for a father.
7. There were more gay male hairdressers than female hairdressers working in that salon.

How many of these movies are out there? Let's start  with Imitation of Life and count forward...

Gave it 2 stars only b/c the girls were athletic, the team was pretty diverse, and the original soccer coach was funny. One he left the scene it was downhill from there. Did not finish watching.",1338508800,,859,4.452229299363057
3474916,2,B001AYWY6S,"Bought this DVD for my 12 yr old soccer-playing daughter. She made fun of the crappy pitches, not that she plays on perfect grass herself. The production value just wasn't there, and the movie was too silly for her; might be suitable for little kids.",1319760000,,250,4.5777777777777775
3474917,4,B001AYWY6S,"For the record, it isn't Missi Pyle's character who says that to her daughter. She and Emily Osment share a different sort of dysfunction.

Parents will do the screwiest things for their kids. SOCCER MOM demonstrates this, with Missi Pyle playing a harried mom who masquerades as famous Italian soccer star, Lorenzo Vincenzo, who comes to coach her 14-year-old daughter's hapless soccer team. SOCCER MOM hits its high points whenever the disguise is on and I grinned at all the wacky that went down. Missi Pyle, under all the prosthetic, looks passable as a dude, although she's not as convincing with the posture and the man voice. Still, Missi is so likable that it's easy to overlook those nitpicks. There's just a bit of Lucille Ball in Missi Pyle.

It's nice to see Emily Osment temporarily shedding HANNAH MONTANA to do her own thing, to step into the spotlight for once. Emily's angry teen role doesn't lend much room for her comedic talents so she switches it up and demonstrates a nice dramatic presence. It also adds a measure of believability that Osment actually has eight or nine years of soccer-playing experience. Underneath all the silly stuff, the core beat concerns the strained relationship between a mom and a daughter grieving over the loss of her father, and the mom's desperate attempt to reconnect. It all adds up to a warm-hearted family flick with bits of good old-fashioned silly cross-dressing thrown in. The soccer sequences won't light up any soccer fan, but that's not the point, anyway. The screwball's the thing, and how ridiculous it really gets when the real (and blustery) Lorenzo Vincenzo shows up at the regional finals. But we all knew that wasn't not gonna happen.

The DVD's bonus stuff: ""Heart of Goal"" features interviews with cast members Missy Pyle, Emily Osment, and Dan Cortese (00:07:48 minutes); ""From Mom To Man"" reveals the arduous process which transforms Missy Pyle into Lorenzo Vincenzo (00:06:27); and the movie trailer.",1292112000,,1975,4.9787878787878785
3474918,3,B001AYWY6S,"Sometimes corny, generally predictable,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soccer-Mom/dp/B001AYWY6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soccer Mom</a>&nbsp;is nonetheless a surprisingly entertaining. In a plot twist reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000ZM1MG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>, a suburban soccer mom dresses up as an Italian soccer star to impress her daughter's team. This film isn't flashy and the acting won't leave you floored, but it does the job.

I suspect this will be a good movie for older kids/younger teens. I found the complaints about sexual innuendos to be nonsense. The whole point of the plot twist is that the female does not realize she's kissing the mom, but thinks she's kissing a soccer star. It's not a lesbian kiss.",1276732800,,860,7.190476190476191
3474949,2,B001AYWY6S,"If you don't mind multiple unnecessary sexual innuendos, then by all means plop your kids in front of this one. I'm not sure who this movie was supposed to be geared for, but I had to fast forward through a bunch for my 11 & 12 year old girls. I guess I'm a little old fashioned, but I have to say I'm getting tired of even PG movies being filled with it. Examples? Homosexual hairstylists going on and on about how badly they want this male coach. A divorcee going on and on about who her husband is dating and rubbing all over the woman dressed as a coach. Then the big kiss between these two women.  Anyhoo, if that doesn't bother you, then, it's a kinda cute movie.",1273708800,,669,4.186046511627907
3474950,4,B001AYWY6S,"I'm not sure what to think about Soccer Mom to be totally honest.  I laughed enough times that I found myself enjoying it, but that doesn't change the fact the storyline definitely has a low budget feel to it.

The film definitely contains humor, though I must admit I didn't really catch any of the sexual references that many others apparently have.  If that's the case, yeah, you probably shouldn't let your teens watch this movie.

The goofy Italian guy was hilarious most of the time, as was the majority of the little things such as the soccer moms kids letting the family dog eat peanut butter and slobber all over the place, haha.

There *is* a positive message about not giving up when it comes to playing the game of soccer poorly.  Gotta give the film a little bit of credit there.  Not the greatest film in the world, but decent enough for a rental.",1271376000,,861,4.480769230769231
3474951,4,B001AYWY6S,"My 11 year old (soccer playing) daugter picked this out at the video store completely at random.  Knowing nothing about the film, I really enjoyed the story-line and unlike many of the other reviewers, I am not going to disclose what it is.  While the plot is far from original, my daughter and I had a very good time watching it together.  If you are a soccer mom (or dad) this one is a no-brainer.  It is filled with light-hearted humor, and the main plot twist is quite entertaining.  Missi Pyle does a fun performance and you will see Emily Osment nicely pull off a role that is far from her character in Hannah Montana.

Regarding the remarks that some have made about sexual content, they do have some merit.  While I don't think that it had a big impact on the movie as a whole, there was one scene where both me and my daughter looked away from the screen as if to say, ""That's just gross!""

Bottom line: This is a fun picture to watch with a soccer kid!",1232928000,,962,4.276243093922652
3474952,4,B001AYWY6S,"I bought this movie based on a recommendation from a friend. My wife and I thought it was well done and funny. My young daughters especially enjoyed watching Emily Osment and the soccer scenes. The story is not the most original, but it has a warm message driving it. Missi Pyle does a great job as Wendy and as Lorenzo. We really felt she cared about her daughter's happiness. It was fun to watch, and we laughed a lot.",1230595200,3,420,4.329113924050633
3474953,5,B001AYWY6S,"I rented this movie from RedBox and I couldn't stop lauging as the mom tries to play a popular italian soccer star just to convince the girls soccer team that he is actually coming to coach. She and the soccer star actually got into an altercation at the airport and he blatantly refused to coach the soccer team, but there are some real surprising twists as the movie progreses. I was laughing for more than a full minute on the part where the real ""Lorenzo"" pours a pitcher of water on himself because two other people poured water on him because they thought he couldn't ""make up his mind"" on what to order. The truth of the matter was the mom (Missi Pyle) was impersonating him and they were in the same room!

You just need to watch the movie to find out if the mom's (Missi Pyle's) act of playing Lorenzo the Italian soccer star is exposed. Emily Osmont did an excellent job as playing Missi Pyle's daughter and she is very good at playing soccer. I wish I could give this movie 6 stars because of how closely it resembled Mrs. Doubtfire and She's the Man (both excellent movies where people try to impersonate others).

I wasn't sure why some people gave it negative reviews based on the sexual dialagoue, but this is a teen movie. What did you expect? But anyway this movie is actually worth buying and keeping as a collector's edition.",1228867200,5,1344,4.459349593495935
3474954,1,B001AYWY6S,"I completely agree with the review called ""Too many sexual references"". In fact, I was getting on here to write a review just like it. I second everything ""Joyful"" said!",1228089600,2,169,4.666666666666667
3474955,1,B001AYWY6S,"I'm not sure why this movie was rated so highly from the others.  It had way too many sexual references to be even shown to teenagers.  It's as though it's so common and acceptable that when two men or two women or two of anyone kiss and grope, we just laugh.  Why do most films these days have to have a gay theme, also?  The language was also shotty.  It would have been a great movie with a great theme of the mother wanting to see her daughter happy.  That's about all I saw good about it.  Don't buy or rent it.  There are other movies worth your time.  Your kids may thank you for your values when they get older.",1227657600,4,619,4.049586776859504
3474956,4,B001AYWY6S,Soccer Mom is a cute family movie that showcases Missie Pyle's range and better than average acting skills. Take out the silly Italian accents and formula driven plot and focus on the interactions and family narrative and you have a pretty good movie. All in all a good movie.,1225584000,,276,4.653061224489796
3474957,5,B001AYWY6S,"What a special movie, for the entire family.  Soccer Mom has it all: strong family values, humor and suspense, and general warmth that touches the entire family.  Not just girl power, but family power too.  And some great acting.  We can't stop talking about it!",1223942400,6,262,4.7555555555555555
3474958,5,B001AYWY6S,I have kids ranging from 6 years to 15 years old (boys and girls)- everyone loved this movie.  My teenage daughter is inviting her girlfriends over this weekend to watch it.  It is a fun movie with a great nice message.  This is a keeper!,1223856000,3,238,4.2444444444444445
