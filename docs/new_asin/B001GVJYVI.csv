8326478,5,B001GVJYVI,"I have been using Tian Yong's methods everyday for about 5 years now, and not only is it easy, I can do it anywhere AND it's relaxing. I am a recently quit heavy smoker of 22 years, but there is barely a line on my face. I always get surprised looks when I tell people my age (and this also gives me the chance to tell people my secret so they can help themselves as well)! My own personal tip is that I use a couple drops of sweet almond oil(or grapeseed oil) and a couple drops of water as my preferred facial oil. So cheap, and soooo natural, but that is just what works for me!
Seriously, do something amazing for yourself and give these techniques a try. You will be SO happy that you did!
I could go on and on and on about how happy and grateful I am for learning some of Tian Yong's knowledge about anti-aging secrets, but I will just say that I hope that more people will use this DVD as an alternative to all of these new, invasive, and horribly expensive ""quick-fix"" procedures, because TIAN YONG ROCKS!!",1268784000,,1014,4.205128205128205
