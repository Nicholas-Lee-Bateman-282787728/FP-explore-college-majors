8418953,4,B0049BW8PQ,"It has been 25 years since I wrote in Portuguese, so this will be in English.  I thought this was a very good movie.  I ordered a Kindle copy of ""Os Sertes"" by Euclides da Cunha at the same time so that I would have the definitive contemporaneous description of the conflict.  I wanted the history.  I think that Jose Wilker was much more believable as the mago in ""Bye Bye Brasil"" and as the malandro in ""Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos"".  Maybe he was uncertain as to how much of a charlatan and how much of a saint Antonio Conselheiro actually was, but I have trouble believing Wilker as a saint; I kept thinking about Jim Jones and Jonestown.  You can tell how much I like Wilker's other two roles by my disappointment in comparison.  Paulo Betti, Claudia Abreu, Marieta Severo and Selton Mello were terrific.  I could identify closely with Betti, Abreu and especially Severo.  Combine this with the serious side and back story of ""Gabriela"" and maybe you can get a feel for the problems of late 19th Century rural Brasil.  If you are interested in a unique and hugely important event in the history of Brasil, the Canudos War, or if you identify with the poor and oppressed, this could be a really important film to see.  It is not up to the standards of Argentina's ""Camila"" or ""La Historia Oficial"", but few films are; that's why it only got 4 stars.  But I am very glad I spent the money on the film; I have watched it 3 times in two months and will watch it again and again.",1410480000,,1481,4.345454545454546
