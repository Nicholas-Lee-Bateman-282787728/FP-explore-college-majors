The story focuses far too much on the pre-race politics and general BS.  The flight scenes are mediocre at best, so I guess it boils down to one really having to be interested in aviation history to sit through this story while pretending to enjoy it.",1393459200,,413,4.324675324675325

7923965,4,B00004UEES,"It's been a while since I've seen it, but after reading The Great Air Race the book, the movie did capture some of the excitement and array of colourful characters who participated in this truly great race, held at a truly great time in aviation history.

The actual story of this race is an exciting one. There were crashes, non-starters,a bogged plane hauled out of mud by 300 townspeople, the marriage of Amy Johnson and Jim Mollison clearly on the rocks, and the flamboyant charismatic charm of Roscoe Turner and his cane made from his favourite lion's tail and so on.  The young Australian Melrose unfortunately was shown as a dark haired shy young man in a leather jacket. Melrose was in fact very blonde, 6 feet tall handsome with blue eyes and always wore a beautifully tailored suit with a silk shirt while flying. He was just 21 years old at the time and the only solo flyer of the lot.

If the movie brings the story to the attention of aviation buffs so they can get the real story from the book, then it's a good thing. Like most films there is so much which has to be left out for practical reasons but you get the idea so at least you can explore further.

It was a Great race.",1338508800,,1192,4.3558558558558556
7923966,4,B00004UEES,"""The Great Air Race"" - a short TV miniseries I'd been searching for for years. Even at the moment of writing only two are available via Amazon. Thanks to ""rpdevo2"" I have one in good condition. IMDb list it as ""Fictional story about the 1934 London - Melbourne MacPherson Robertson Air race ..."" I consider it was close enough to convince. I don't know if the aircraft left in historically accurate order, but they were shown in right order at the end where it counts. The story is told well.

This movie is what an aviation buff needs in their collection. It was filmed in Australia, so get used to gum trees. England looks like Australia. France looks like Australia. Karachi looks like Australia.

This was made before the computer graphics which so benefitted ""The Aviator"" and ""Amelia"", everything was in-camera. Two replica DH88's were used, but other than that, available real aircraft stood in for the originals. The famous DC-2 entered by KLM, the ""Uiver"", was played by its successor, a DC-3; Turner's Boeing was a nicely repainted Avro Anson from a museum. Too many Stearman biplanes for my taste, but generally the standins, classics themselves, did good service, and the liveries were spot on. Airfield anoraks, drool your hearts out!

The pace builds at a 1930s rate, through the politicking to the gala start, during which time we meet the main players, from the squeaky-clean South Australian Jimmy Melrose, who set a record just arriving at the start line, to the brash, self-aggrandising American Roscoe Turner, and Amy Johnson and Jim Mollison with their troubled marriage. After that, it's what can go wrong in a long flight 1934, and a visual love affair with all the old aircraft, leading up to the final run for the prize in Melbourne.

7923967,4,B00004UEES,"Yes, my fellow reviewer, you probably missed the point. This is an Autralian movie made for a large audience. And a good one too. The only criticism I can think of is that it takes more than an hour before the real action starts. A lot of attention is given to the characters and their individual circumstances. Apart from this, The Great Air Race is historically accurate. This is how it really happened. It was 1934 and this race attracted only the most audacious adventurers in the world. Sadly, they left out the second Dutch entry, the Panderjager (panther hunter), one of the fastest planes in the world then. Nevertheless, this is a most enjoyable movie though it takes quite some time to really take off. The end isn't very strong either. Still worth four stars.",1245974400,,770,4.669117647058823
