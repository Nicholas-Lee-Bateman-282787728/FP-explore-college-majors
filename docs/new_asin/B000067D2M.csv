1714911,2,B000067D2M,"I have seen this movie before, maybe it was on broadcast TV. Now I've seen it on blu-ray. The movie is mostly depressing. It takes place in a small southern town. The people who live in this town are either bored or depressed. About the only happy person in this picture is the town hooker. It seems everyone has her telephone number, she makes house calls! Also great at polite small talk.  Halle Berrys and Billy Bob Thorton's charactures seems to have more than their fair share of problems. It's also so quiet I had to rewind and turn up the volume to hear some of the dialogue. There are a few scenes you might find disturbing.
 However the ending was happy. That always works for me",1347148800,,688,4.409448818897638
1714912,2,B000067D2M,"The video (Blu-Ray) part, of the DVD was fine, but the audio of the DVD did not match the Blu-Ray player... Audio was slightly off.",1346284800,,131,4.28
1714913,5,B000067D2M,This is a very interesting film starring Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Barry.  Very erotic and emotional.  All the better in Blu-ray format.,1306713600,,139,5.0
1714914,3,B000067D2M,"Did Halle Berry deserve an Academy Award for her performance?  Perhaps.  She had a wide range of emotions to scale and did it effectively, not to mention engaging in a soft core porn scene.  I found Billy Bob Thornton's performance effective as well, but he was stuck with a character who is confusing and inexplicable.  He goes from raving racist who scares off two black kids with a gun to Berry's sensitive lover.  He's downright obsessive about his trips to the restaurant for ice cream, but we never learn why.  The latter half of the movie largely drags along toward an ineffective ending that simply fades into a starry sky with nothing finalized.

While there are good things to say about Monster's Ball, there are much better ways pass an evening than watching this film.",1295049600,,780,4.733333333333333
1714915,3,B000067D2M,"Very thematic and thought provoking film carried on by actors who fulfilled their acting roles tremendously. I enjoyed the realism of emotions and sometimes apathy embodied by all the characters. Characters personalities and emotions really became tangible when necessary. Plot line evolved very well and was original, with a few surprising twists and turns here and there. Real life problems, such as racism, abuse, obesity, apathy and poverty all solidified for a great storyline. However, the ending was very far fetched and unrealistic. It's hardly to believe Leticia wouldn't confront Hank immediately after discovering the drawings her former executed boyfriend drew. This kind of left a bitter feeling of inconclusiveness towards the film. No matter how Hank responds to the accusations and what follows, as a spectator, you need to see that transpire. It was almost torture not to see what transpired after that because you know Leticia would confront Hank, you just don't know when and I think this should of been included in the film to bring closure.",1289347200,2,1061,5.247058823529412
1714916,5,B000067D2M,"NOW I SEE HOW HALLE WON AN OSCAR FOR THE MOVIE.SHE WAS EVERYTHING AN ACTRESS SHOULD BE IN A ROLE WHICH IS DRAMATIC,CONVINCING,SEXY AND MAKE YOU THINK DURING THE MOVIE. That love scene was the most passionate, realistic act I've ever seen in a movie. A must see for all.",1261872000,4,269,4.4
1714917,4,B000067D2M,"If you have to see a realistic and horrifically depressing film with great performances - this is it.  This tragedy set in a prison community in the racist south is chock full of surprises and shockers.  Thornton's three generational family is a conflictual mess with varying degrees of vicious racism and mental illness.  Halle Berry's family fares no better with tremendous loss of everything and everyone in her life.  When the two finally meet, there is a sort of acceptance and redemption on both parts, but its terribly painful to watch.  Heath Ledger plays Thornton's more sensitive son in an underplayed role.  Halle Berry bares her soul and her body with a worthiness Oscar rewarded, only to see her disappear into the ""X-Men"" again!  Berry and Thornton have a torrid sex scene that is barely cut only to have him wake up in the morning with his underwear on - only in America!

Now in this blu-ray edition, the colors, crispness and sound is impeccable.  The sound is in DTS 5.1 and extras include, Audio Commentary with Director and Writers, four deleted scenes, the featurettes of `On the set', `Behind the scenes with the producer', cast and crew interviews, music for the film and the theatrical trailer.",1235001600,20,1218,4.845410628019324

1714960,5,B000067D2M,"First I would like to say, ""Yes I've had a infatuation for Halle Berry!"", but I still give a true review. Monster's Ball was far most life like film that has a true capturing Ahavah of turning hate into love. From a prejudice individual to honoring the beauty of a gorgeous woman. There was much heart-felt sentiment in this film from a mother struggling as a single parent, a son being hated by the father, the father trained in the ways of being a redneck, a mother struggling in poverty, and much more. The film is definitely unrated in sexual matters but being honest that what many of us adults like about the movie but the connection of the sexual matters did give more so amorous and sensual type of love making with a little rough lovemaking, spiced with one of the most gorgeous women in the world Halle Berry. I also love the way Halle was more so virtuous in the film and embraced her intimate hairs in the film. The portion of Billy playing the prejudice individual was more realistic and well acted. Honestly the film was excellent! The film given a more public figure of inspiration on how to treat a gorgeous woman (basically, as treasure, devotion, sensual with a little ice cream on the side).",1449878400,3,1210,4.529680365296803

1714977,5,B000067D2M,A rare gem that Hollywood has produced. It has a great cast and good storyline. It is not an easy flick to watch on a saturday afternoon. It has lots of emotion. Billy Bob Thornton played a prison officer with a sour relationship with his son. (Played by Heath Ledger) Heath shoot himself in front of his Dad in the first forty minutes which it is a bit of a waste that his screen time was too little. Halle Berry played wife of the death row prisoner and mother of a kid. Both Billy and Halle deveopled into a relationship after Billy help to send her son to hospital after an accident. You can see Billy changing from a cold hearted person to more human after the relationship started. It is a heart warming movie and do not be surprise that tears may come out of your eyes automatically.,1412812800,,790,4.308724832214765

I peeked over at her in the parts that make me cry and so was she.  I really liked watching this with someone who'd never seen it before.  My son was actually quiet and didn't spoil any of it like he sometimes will do.  The quality of these actors is outstanding.

It is a very disturbing and difficult movie to watch at times,but it will get you glued to your seat. It's about people who's lives will change forever. A prisoner who was on the Death Row and a prison guard Billy Bob Thornton who got involved in relationship with the prisoner's wife and just watch unlikely story evolved. This is a movie you got to see 'all of Halle Berry'. It is a sad story, but good one and will get set in your mind for some time.

7962714,3,B000067D2M,"This movie was incredible for the first 45 minutes.  The relationship dynamics of Billy Bob Thorton's character with his father and son...as well as Halle Berry's relationship with her son...all set to the backdrop of a death row inmate's electrocution.  It was truly spectacular.

Unfortunately, the second half of the movie wasn't equal to the beginning...it's almost as if they were trying to hold the film together by resorting to showcasing a very racy sex scene between Halle and Billy Bob.  Their actions simply weren't believable.  Suddenly, Billy Bob isn't racist?  And Halle doesn't care that she's sleeping with the guy who essentially killed her husband?  Seemed a little far-fetched.

If I'm being totally honest, I didn't see anything spectacular with the acting either.
Is it worth watching?  Yes.
Is it Academy Award worthy?  No.
Will you find yourself rolling your eyes occasionally?  Probably.
