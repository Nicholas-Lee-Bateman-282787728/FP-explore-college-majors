Only watched 40 min so far, but seems to be super throughout. very satisfied. I got the 2nd dvd as well, and we'll see how it is. I anticipate it being super, based on 1",1417392000,,311,4.2
8131987,5,B000GGS0UU,This video seems to be a copy of an old VHS. The quality is still very good. The teacher is very good and entertaining. The lessons are also very good. This is the best DVD I've seen so far for learning the Tabla.,1369785600,,213,3.9767441860465116
8131988,4,B000GGS0UU,"Batish presents concepts in a clear, easy to understand way. The majority of this video is focused on the tabla drum it self (what are the parts, how to tune it, how to take care of it) and short introduction to the hand technique of 4 basic hits. I found this to be informative as a beginners guide.

The major drawback of this video is that it is a copy of 1990's VHS onto DVD, without a menu to jump to the different sections (eg background info vs how to hit the tabla). So it makes going back to the demo/practice section difficult to find. While the video looks homemade, it didn't bother me because there is clear view of the tabla and hands, and the content itself was worthwhile.",1358553600,2,688,4.292307692307692

8131990,4,B000GGS0UU,"There is not much material about this kind of instrument, the Tabla. For me it was a good stuff because I'm learning about Tabla. There are some words in sanscrit. It could be good idea if we can see these strage words in the video like in the introduction to Tabla 2.",1175472000,4,268,4.173076923076923
