I liked everything about the first season and the second season doesn't fail to be funny. the box set is also very nice, it has the same glittery pink like the first season but they have covered the back with pictures of the characters. personally, I think it looks better that the first seasons.",1380499200,13,391,4.6

5716551,4,B00CDV4R26,"Hello there, and thanks for taking time to read my review!
Let's see, what's to be said here? If you liked the first season, you'll get more of the same in the second. The humor is the same, the relationships are largely the same (with some minor developments), the magic is the same.
If you're hoping for huge plot advancement, I think you'll find yourself rather disappointed with this entry. It doesn't really take you to any new places, but instead tries to give you more background on the already-familiar.
The only character in this show that I don't really like at all is Orito, who is the standard perverted sidekick character to the main guy. He's funny in moderation, but I could have dealt with it just as well if he barely appeared in the show at all.
Still, I'll close this up by reiterating that if you enjoyed the first season, I really doubt you'll dislike this one.",1451520000,,882,4.51875

5716565,5,B00CDV4R26,"Good series. This second season is a good continuation of the first series. The story is light and humorous. I like both seasons of this series, however the 2nd season does not bring in new cast members but does a little more development of the existing cast. Therefore, some may feel that this 2nd season is not as fulfilling as the 1st season. If you liked the 1st season, you'll probably want to get this followup season. For those who are unsure of this series, if you just want to watch a show that's entertaining and light hearted with some comedic elements, then check this series out.",1442793600,,592,4.542056074766355

5716567,5,B00CDV4R26,"This review will consist of 2 things: What the product contains and What I think of the product.
First off this product is the 2nd season of the ""Is This A Zombie?"" Anime Series. The Title is: ""Is This A Zombie of The Dead?"".
Second The product looks exactly how it does in the picture with the Anime Classics Slip Cover.
Next This Product features a total of 4 discs. 2 of which are the blu rays and the other 2 are the dvd versions.
Each disc contains extras that belong to the episodes featured on that specific disc.
They also contain the 2 OVA's featured in this 2nd season.
This product comes with an English Dub as well as the original Japanese with English Subs.

This anime series was really great! If your looking for a Action/Comedy story about a zombie this is a great choice for you! Also if you like a little bit of ecchi and romance in your anime, this definitely will be good for you as well!
This product overall is great I love this show and having a physical copy is the best.",1438819200,3,995,4.264550264550264

I love how they have different types of characters from other genres of anime living together! aside from that it's hysterical and I love how they transition from fast paced comedy to slow and serious during the show!

5716573,5,B00CDV4R26,"If you liked the magical, mystery shenanigans from the first season, you're going to love round two!
From ""ghost"" counsellors to our beloved undead cross dressing hero to a psychopath in a singles mixer, Is this a Zombie?! Of the Dead certainly delivers more crazy dilemmas and dangerous dates with destiny.
In this season, not every ""normal"" thing is normal, as our hero becomes unwittingly entangled with a magical force that makes Haruna's teacher shudder shortly after breaking Mistletane saving the school and his classmates from a megalo attack. We also find our way into a maid cafe where our hero's lovely roommates work serving and challenging the guests.
A birthday celebration turns chaotic when Eucliwood is forced to choose a favorite gift, then the topic turns to her age...
Residents of the underworld are more prevalent than you'd think as is revealed twice as events progress, and one is needed to help fight a mischievous magical force that threatens our very undead hero's everyday life, but she's too occupied with something else.
Is this a Zombie?! Of the Dead is a must-have if you enjoyed the first installation.",1429228800,,1135,5.01058201058201

It's so utterly ridiculous and off the wall, And I've fallen in love with this anime, assuming that sort of thing can happen. I discovered this anime halfway through the first season, and once it suddenly ended, I figured this would be the first season to get. and I definitely have my eyes on the first season. There is just one thing I'd like to know.... WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWO SEASONS?!!!! I went looking for #3, to discover that it does not exist, as far as I know. Wow, when Miss Eucliwood Hellscythe said Thanks for watching in episode 11 at the end,  she was NOT kidding. WHY must they make anime girls so darn CUTE?!!!
Eh, well, what can we do? You like cute anime girls with two melons in front of them, A lot of them are here. As Miss Hellscythe again said, Ayumu is a lucky guy. And he IS undead. And he's also a Magical Garment Girl, and *SPOILERS* gains a couple extra abilities near the end of this season. And he wouldn't want it any other way. Only Ayumu Aikawa can end up living in a house with 6 others of the opposite sex, all of which are after him, in some way, shape, or form, nudge nudge wink wink. You want Romance? Hilariousness? Crazy Stuff going on? throw a zombie into the mix *Spoilers again, sorry* that does NOT interact well with sunlight? THIS is the ANIME for YOU!

5716595,5,B00CDV4R26,"Funny and funnier! the sqeual to the 1st season and its just as good as the first if not better! heres my review!!

Plot and characters: (minor spoilers only) we continue the adventues with Ayumu, Eucilwood Hellscythe, Haruna the magical garment girl, Seraphim the vampire ninja,  Yuki Yoshida another vampire ninja, and Sarasvati another vampire ninja. They continue their adventures with perverted jokes and a good story line!

Pros: if you seen the 1st season and love it then this is right up your alley! its just as messed up and funny as the first but maybe just a bit more because it has 2 OVA's instead of 1 just like season 1.

Pros 2: The reason this is Limited Edition is because it comes in a very styleish pink and hard cardboard box, if you get both season 1 and 2 editions they look amazing next to eachother, perfect twin boxes. Great for any collection!

Cons: If you don't like perverted jokes of any kind then don't see this series cus its filled with them. This series is NOT for little kids in anyway at all.

Over all: Buy this series!! its amazing and goes really visually well with the 1st season. You cant go wrong with this sqeual!",1413244800,,1157,4.485714285714286

5716598,4,B00CDV4R26,"As many have stated, if you loved the first season than you will be happy with this one. The only complaint I have is the story seemed to stand still at times. What I mean is nothing really important happens and you never feel any growth or changes in the main characters. Sure you get a little more back story on Eu and a couple of new characters are introduced but again each no really stand out or memorable episodes. As a matter of fact, I could have done without Taeko becoming more involved with Ayumu. It was weird that the creators, of the series, pushed her into a more prominent role. That being said, I think Saras taking a liking to Ayumu was funny as heck. Her lusting after his body and throwing herself at him always brought a smile to my face. Speaking of smiles, without a doubt Haruna is one of the funniest and most unique characters I have ever seen in this type of anime. Not sure why but she just seems to get all the slapstick stuff and her being a ""genius"" is just too comical.

5 stars for the characters and 4 stars for the episodes and overall story.",1408060800,4,1077,4.253658536585366

It has a fun story as well if you are into anime like i am, then you can't go wrong with such a buy! Make sure to get the 1st season or watch it before buying incase it is not for you. This anime is about a almost normal guy in which gets killed walking home one night from a store, then someone or something brings him back to life (don't wanna spoil the show), and he becomes a zombie. Later on in the show he gains extra powers by mistake from another char in the show, which she is not to pleased about. There are only a few anime that really fit this style. Here are a few i like that are a little bit like this one.  1)vampire + rosario  2)heaven's lost property  3)Sekirei season 1 and 2. 4) Cat planet cuties (one of my fav).  These are all very much alike in some ways, also note that i did not place them in any order , all are just random. They all have what people tend to call ""Fan service"", I enjoy all of theses anime.

The 1st time i saw this anime it took me half a episode to get into it, then i got hooked, don't know why really i guess i love the plot lol. Me any my brother are anime collectors so we have a lot of anime of course, and i just recently bought the 2nd season Is this a Zombie. The only thing i didn't like was that it seemed that this version was DVD only, and i love blue-rays, aside from that everything is great, expect of course there is never enough anime!!!!!!!!

The cross dressing zombie and his friends return to face an all new threat. While all the things you loved about the first season are back, but anime fans who dislike cliffhangers will be disappointed by the ending of this season. I personally don't mind cliffhangers, but if a third season or a movie is never made to conclude the story set up in this season of the series Im going to be very angry.

The animation, characters, humor, story and English dub are amazing!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,,1052,4.898876404494382

But during the season there were hints of a potentially good plot and a few things out of the blue (for example, who exactly was that guy vomiting blood?).

If you were a fan of season one, then two will do nothing but solidify it, adding more backstory Eucliwood and the rest, while introducing a few new awesome characters along the way( Chris and her sake) both from Underworld and Villiers.
The voice actors seem to have hit their stride very comfortably in the second season, with all major actors reprising their characters, and even the new characters getting some help from veteran voice actors that make you feel like your being eased right into these new additions
While it wouldnt hurt, this is also a series that while the first season is great, you don't have watched one to get in on the story, as your brought up to speed rather quickly, and it just goes well.
All in all a very funny anime that has plenty of laughs and even a few heartfelt moments made all the more engrossing to the story by a great cast that just works well with one another.",1381968000,,1068,4.426395939086294
