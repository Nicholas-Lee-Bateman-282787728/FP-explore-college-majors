2182745,2,B0006FFRHA,"I was looking for DVDs on women spies when I came across this DVD.  What caught my eye was the DVD title:
""Secrets of War""...""Women Spies of World War II"" and on the DVD cover was a picture of Margaretha Zelle better known as Mata Hari.  The problem with that is Mata Hari lived from 1876 to 1917. She was accused of being a spy during World War I and was executed before a French firing squad in 1917 and thus died long before World War II.  Not long after her trial, people began to doubt her guilt and many now think she was perhaps just a convenient scapegoat for the French military who were doing badly at that time against the better managed German army.  She was looked at suspiciously because of her well known promiscuity with powerful and high ranking men.  However, she had nothing to do with spying during World War II.
However, it seems from Mata Hari's picture on this DVD cover that the producers thought that Mata Hari was connected to World War II spying which doesn't say much for the accuracy of this documentary.",1337472000,,1033,4.41578947368421
2182746,4,B0006FFRHA,"With a mix of total cynicism and idealism, this is a late Cold War thriller which will provide you with the necessary elements of suspense, fear for the fate of the ""Good Guys"" and loathing for the ""Bad Guys"" with a novel twist. There are elements which weaken the impact as compared to the best of breed in this genre, but still it should grip most who do not demand only the superior. Martin Sheen and Sam Neill fulfill the demands of the script, which is a bit high in its requirement that one accepts the unlikely, particularly in the case of Neill's character; Brigitte Fossey is appealing in her heroines role. Derek Jacobi is wasted in a caricatured role as an East German security agent but the other supporting players do not induce the same sense of waste in fulfilling the stereotypes they play. All in all, it would have made an excellent made for television film and is worth a look-in by devotees of this type of work.",1324080000,10,932,4.488235294117647
2182747,5,B0006FFRHA,"Lots of twists and turns right up to the end, very convincing and enjoyable -- one of the better spy films we've seen.",1320624000,3,118,4.173913043478261
2182748,2,B0006FFRHA,"""Engima"" is a 1983 black and white spy thriller starring Martin Sheen, Sam Neill, and  Brigette Fossey. It was directed by French director Jeannot Szwarc.

Martin Sheen was hot in 1983. He had been nominated for an Emmy for his performances in ""The Execution of Private Slovak"" (1974) and ""Taxi!!"" (1978) and for a Golden Globe in ""The Subject was Roses"" (1968) and ""Blind Ambition"" (1979). ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) had been a huge hit and the TV mini series ""Kennedy"" in which he played the President was ongoing.

French director Jeannot Szwarc  started in TV in the late 60s then turned to films with ""Jaws 2"" (1978) and ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980). ""Engima"" was his next film, but before long he returned to TV where he has worked exclusively . Szwarc said he was trying to create a film as good as ""The Third Man"" (1949).

What we don't have is another ""Third Man"". The acting is mediocre, the action is extremely slow, and the photography is dull. The story is OK and there are some good twists and turns, but overall it is disappointing. The NY Times said ""this is the spy film at its most absurdly hard-boiled and at its most icily perfunctory"".

When you think of great spy films, circa 1980, the ones that come to mind are Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" (1969),  ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938), and ""Notorious"" (1946), Richard Burton's ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" (1965), and ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1975). Fans of the spy thrillers would do better viewing any of these films.",1302048000,4,1494,4.636363636363637
2182749,3,B0006FFRHA,"Good plot, surprise ending, good script, love and betrayal, decent acting. A few scenes stretch credibility but for the most part an enjoyable cold war spy yarn.",1264550400,5,161,5.0
2182750,5,B0006FFRHA,"This is the second disk in a three disk series, and the episodes on this disk begin to pay-off on the premise set up in the first four episodes. These four episodes do little to explain the mysteries of the series - like who the girls really are - what is this quest they are on - and why do they keep talking to dandelions? Once again, the episodes are almost marred by an excess of ""fan service"" - which, I guess, can be explained by a series based on a hentai game - but the series begings to introduce some serious elements among all the goofiness. The sisters begin to experience some of the consequences of their traveling through time and space, and, due to a misadventure, are tragically separated. And Ai has a brief love affair with somebody who may be a hero or a villain. I began to fear that the producers were going to ""Tenchi Muyo"" us by suddenly introducing world shattering villans and giving the heroines sudden mysterious super abilities to combat the threat, but, instead, they threw a curve and instead give us an episode about a Shinto shrine maiden who longs to experience a Christmas party and her cranky grandfather who wants to give her a Christmas present but doesn't want to violate his Shinto vows in doing so. I was left thinking ""where is this series taking us?"" which is not a bad thing for the middle portion of a story arc. The emotions the girls displayed when the sisters meet up again (and I trust I am not spoiling the ""surprise"" since the back of the DVD gives away the reunion) make the episodes worthwhile. Anybody who has brothers or sisters with whom they bicker and tease but secretly care for will empathise with the Ai, Mai and Mii. Be sure to have flouride toothpaste on hand, as the final episode on the disk is so sweet it will induce cavities.",1181347200,2,1793,4.4363636363636365
2182751,4,B0006FFRHA,"A bit dificult to review disc 2 of 3 without generalising for the series. You will only buy this if you got disc one and liked that anyway.

The nuts and bolts: well drawn, nothing jars (such as poor frame rate). Sound is good. Subtitles pretty much agree with the English soundtrack, so you won't miss too much info if you listen to the Japanese (which is always more fun anyway).

The story. Not really a gripping tale; I kept watching to see where it was going. Of course, there was no resolution - that's for the next series! (Please give us the funds to make another series Mr Producer...) No, it's the human relationship aspect that really hooked me. I imagine anyone who has moved around alot residentially will appreciate this story and the lesson it gives. It wasn't what I expected going into it, but I liked it a lot by the end.

One weird aspect which may be the culture gap between Asia & ROW: the story could almost be aimed at 10 year olds (and up)and then BANG! the girls are all in the bath together. More nudity here than in Love Hina, Chobits and others of similar ilk. I'm not complaining mind, but the 16 up age restriction must have limited the market.

So, with regard to the above - 4 stars. There is better out there and this is not essential viewing, but you won't come away feeling you've wasted your money.",1181260800,3,1334,4.366935483870968

Martin Sheen! and a very young Sam Neil (I only remember him from Jurassic Park.) The thing that sets this era's spy dramas apart from modern efforts is that they don't go overboard with the garbage hacker crap - the mere appearance of a computer was enough to entertain audiences at the time, and as such, they work a little harder on the script and worry less about FX.",1472774400,,529,4.408163265306122

2182997,4,B0006FFRHA,"This film explores the complexity of human nature.  Personal and global relationships intertwine in intricate ways that reveal the characters of the three principals and a tier of secondary persona.  Cold-War-era values of the United States, the U. S. S. R, and East Germany are juxtaposed against the passions and principles of these individuals.

The plot requires attention, and this is rewarded with post-viewing moments of realization that enhance the experience.  The acting is convincing; the photography, costumes, and dialogue provide the authenticity that made the movie soar.  One minor observation:  this reviewer does not remember seeing in this spy-vs-spy adventure a single firearm.  Firepower, that sine qua non of today's action films, seems to have been replaced here by brainpower - the characters spend a lot of time trying to understand what the other side is up to.  What this says about how our human nature is evolving will be left to the reader.

Although there seemed to be a splicing error in the download from Amazon, this was a minor distraction.  Enigma deserves more acclaim than it has received.  It is a thought-provoking classic that entertains.  More movies of this caliber would give Hollywood a good name.",1438905600,2,1242,5.185929648241206

No one will ever really know ... except that Hollywood has really accepted and made minor to major stars out of otherwise nobodies with about zero acting talent !

The real enigma machine was mechanical, not electronic, and was developed, by Nazi Germany, early in WW2, to exchange encrypted text messages with military units in the field.  In true enigma history, a machine was stolen, and debris was staged to make it look like the stolen machine was destroyed in an accident.  The allies used this machine, extensively, to fight the war with a huge intelligence advantage.  The movie story was updated to make the movie more interesting.

2183097,4,B0006FFRHA,"Enigma is a surprisingly good film.

It has very good acting by a number of recognizable faces, in addition to the main stars, Martin Sheen, Sam Neill, Brigitte Fossey, and Kevin McNally. Very believable film with a great story, and a very spy-like feel with the look and ""feel"" of the sets. It is quite enjoyable and even tricks the audience a few times.

While it is not known to me if the actual Enigma machine was ever digitized for the computers of the 1980's, it is still a great story.

Martin Sheen really took a bath in this film... literally, as he was soaked by water (it appeared cold, but was likely more tepid... we can only hope) a number of times.

An interesting feature was the plane used as a Mig-25 on a tarmac. It would have been difficult to create a mock-up of the real thing and even impossible to obtain a real one from the USSR or the US and no one generally notices such details. It appeared to be more akin to a North American F-100 than a Mig-25. Also, English is used as the main language of the film, which was not distracting at all, given the venue of East Berlin with both Germans and Russians as characters.

A definite must see for any fan of this genre or of the main stars. Cold War espionage intrigue is quite enjoyable on film and this story does a great job to meet that expectation.",1423008000,,1324,4.301204819277109

2183120,3,B0006FFRHA,"It was interesting to see well known actors 30 years younger than they are today.  Their youth produced a tiny bit of cognitive disconnect.  The acting had the style of the 70s-early 80s; that is, it was fine at the time but seems a little stilted today.  The general public was just becoming aware of computers on a personal level, and it was fun to see what was meant to be impressive high-tech but is already so old and cumbersome.  (This ought to remind us of how old and cumbersome our current high-tech will appear in 30 years!)

Replicating an enigma machine in digital hardware seems so blindly ignorant.  Even the most rudimentary software solution would work better.  But, of course the hardware is just a MacGuffin to move the plot forward.  Except that the plot seems little more than an excuse to preach about the ""Evil Empire"" and expose and denigrate women.  And the ""twist"" if you can call it that, is an attack on the ""Good guys,"" that just serves to further confuse and insult the intelligence of the audience.  The redeeming moment near the end of the movie almost saves this picture.  I don't want to spoil it entirely, but it doesn't quite succeed in redeeming either the protagonists or antagonist.
