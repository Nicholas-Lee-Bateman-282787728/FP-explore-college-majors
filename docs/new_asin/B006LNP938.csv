8500436,5,B006LNP938,"Lee Hammond is a remarkable teacher.  The job of a good teacher is not to lose her student's attention and to simplify the material to the point where he/she can connect.  Because I had always been interested in art, following the basic instruction that I received in middle school, I took an advanced art class in high school.  That was over forty years ago, and while I continued to produce an occasional sketch, I never grew as an artist.  I would rate my level of success at about a C or fair, although some people seem to like what I produced - beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder; I wasn't happy with my ""finished products"".  After recently thumbing through one of Miss Hammond's books and watching one and half of her videos, I finally acquired what I lacked: a good foundation.  At the point that arthritis crippled and weakened my hands to such a degree that I stopped doing many manual jobs that I enjoyed, a few weeks ago, I decided to try art again.  Miss Hammond's instruction has helped immensely - this self-taught artist has two exceptional gifts: she's an excellent artist and a great teacher; the two don't always go hand in hand, but Lee Hammond definitely has the touch.

I have observed several video instructors, going back to the days of black and white TV until now, and in one afternoon, I've learned more about technique from Miss Hammond than ever before.  True, artists don't always use the same techniques or follow the set ""givens"".  Being self-taught, Miss Hammond apparently developed her skills using analytical thinking, a lot of trial and error, and staying the course until she hit upon the secrets to producing lifelike pictures.  Making the procedure simple, but not boring, for a student to follow is the ace in the hole.

Today, I received three of Miss Hammond's DVD's: ""Lifelike Drawing in Colored Pencil"" (84 min.), ""Drawing Lifelike Portraits with Lee Hammond"" (90 min.), and ""Lifelike Drawing"" (83 min.).  I'll have to look for more after I've accomplished something worthwhile with these, and I don't think it will take long, although Miss Hammond cautions her students to be patient and not rush.  I'll review them at the necessary slower pace later because I presently want to get an overview.  Despite the comprehensive, quick peek, I have learned a lot, in theory, of course.

I quickly popped the first DVD into the player; it's wonderful that you can view these DVD's anywhere and not attached to a computer.  Miss Hammond starts each lesson by introducing the viewer to the materials he'll need for the project.  Next, she progresses to technique; which include instruction in shading, layering, blending, and, in the case of colored pencils, burnishing; how to hold your tools; and how to preserve them.  The first lesson is to work with your pencil, moving it up and down, and back and forth.  Then you work your way up to a sphere, which she points out, is an essential part of many jobs that you will tackle.  I'm glad I didn't any of the introductions because I learned several new things from each.  Miss Hammond's patient, step by step instruction kept me glued to the screen.  Now, whenever I thumb through a newspaper, I see every picture in a brand new way.  Mind you, I had already learned that I could draw a person or animal by looking for certain geometric shapes within the targeted subject; but learning from Miss Hammond is like moving from hamburgers to fillet mignon - now I really, really see the shapes, lighting, and shading in every situation.  Arthritis or no arthritis I'm going to strive to get as good as I can get and hopefully incorporate such drawings into the production of a couple of children's books that I'm presently working on, and the credit will go to Miss Hammond's gifts.

This was the last video I viewed and it turned out to be the most intense of all, having a lot of difficult subject matter.  You learn the blending, shading, contrast, and texture; and progress to the sphere, which is then followed by the vase, the dog, a rose, tree trunk texture, and finally the pineapple, the most detailed and perhaps complicated subject.  Of all the tapes, I found the colored pencil video the easiest to follow, but that may just be me, and it was the first one that I viewed.  Whatever your preferences, there is a lot in each video to keep you entertained and engaged for a long time.",1340668800,,4388,4.684485006518905
