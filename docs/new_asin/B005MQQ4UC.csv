8479640,5,B005MQQ4UC,"This was a great documentary about Maryland Crab Culture. There is a segment on steamed crabs, and the second segment is on the best crab cakes. I got mad at myself for watching it too early in the season -- it will make you VERY hungry. Please watch this only during crab season or when you will be able to get some Chesapeake Bay Blue Crabs!",1456272000,,343,4.212121212121212
