4111512,5,B003D8M0N6,"My teenage son has really enjoyed the series and anything I can do to get him away from prime-time TV (garbage) is worth it.  The price on these was great ($15 for two seasons)so I bought them all.

Well worth the investment.",1295308800,2,225,4.333333333333333
4111513,5,B003D8M0N6,"The classic is still applicable.  The Cosby Show dealt with real life situations, solving actual problems that parents and non-parents encounter, and it did it in an inventive and humorous way.  Seasons 5 and 6 continue to capture that essential element.  Even though the resolution isn't HD, these are still worth the time to watch.  I cant get enough of it.",1295308800,2,359,4.836065573770492
4111514,5,B003D8M0N6,I enjoy every last episodes of these two seasons. My daughter and I watch Cosby's before bedtime. Instead of a bedtime story we have bedtime Cosby.,1294963200,2,147,4.6923076923076925
4111515,5,B003D8M0N6,"I've always loved the Cosby Show but admittedly season 5 was not my favourite. However, I had to have all the seasons and when I found out there was a Seasons 5 & 6 DVD for the price of $15, I had to buy it. Now, I thought that this was the two seasons in one case with the cover being how it looks here, in green with the two pictures of Cosby. But no! It was actually the two separate seasons, two DVD sets shrinkwrapped together! So I was amazed at what I received - a great value! Now I have to decide if I want to buy the last two seasons (as this same value pack) just to complete my collection :-)",1288396800,5,604,3.879032258064516
4111516,5,B003D8M0N6,"Cosby is one of the all time great television shows. This DVD collection, especially at the bargain basement price of $5 per season, is a must own. It makes lite of many family situations. Family sitcoms should aspire to this today.",1279411200,5,232,4.682926829268292

4111559,5,B003D8M0N6,"I am buying this item to replace the inferior release of The 25th Anniversary Edition by First Look Studios. Several of the discs have scratches, but were playable. I feel that the two sets I just bought will keep what I have intact for the future. At this time when Bill Cosby is under attack by several women, some who lack credibility, this was a good TV program. It has been taken off the air, since the stations involved are awaiting the outcome of these allegations. It is amusing to me as the Daughter of two Lawyers, that the statute of limitations is long over. Why have as many as thirty some women come forward? What is their real beef with Mr. Cosby? I still believe the program is safe to show to children, but they may ask questions about the negative publicity. Parents need to be able to explain that nothing has been proven up to this point. Think for yourself how you feel about the program.",1432512000,,909,4.416666666666667

My only complaint is that when I stop an episode at the end and restart on a different day, it doesn't remember which episode I was on and starts over on the first episode of the disc.  It's not my player as it normally remembers my position with other movies.  It's a minor inconvenience and I still recommend them.

4111629,4,B003D8M0N6,"I had to give this terrific TV show 4 stars only due to product issues. There is something wrong with the sound channels, many times the left or right channel goes much fainter, I have noticed when there is a camera change, is also when the sounds cut low. It happens from Season 1 to about season 6. I watch this, along with Roseanne and Sinfeld, when I go to bed so I have head phones one. The other two TV shows has no issues with the sound, so I know it's not my DVD player. I am now watching the Cosby series again for the second time since I bought these, the sound is still an issue, it's very very annoying. I'm rather disappointed in that. So, with that, this is a review about the products, the physical product would only get something like a 1 star, the THE COSBY SHOW product, the show itself, certainly gets a 5 stars.",1355443200,6,832,4.173913043478261
4111630,5,B003D8M0N6,Seeing the Bill Cosby show again and again keeps me in stiches and brings back memories of a great TV family comedy series.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this series. It's also a good sharing video for uplifting your relatives (and friends) in the nursing home.  The Bill Cosby show is a good conversation DVD to show for those who are not watching all-day football games on Thanksgiving or for those who are having any family/friend dinner gathering.,1352851200,2,457,4.7
4111631,5,B003D8M0N6,"We own seasons 1-6  and we just purchased seasons seven and eight as we want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand!

While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!

Bill Cosby is great and we are thankful to enjoy such talent! We wish that the Fatherhood cartoon would be released on DVD. Two seasons on Nick Nite (2004-2005 season run time and has been canceled). and twenty six episodes.. This was a great cartoon with values, please release this on DVD. And also Little Bill on DVD.

Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin show, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx show, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.

Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!
thanks.",1336089600,,3395,4.084084084084084
4111632,5,B003D8M0N6,"I had never watched ""The Cosby Show"" until I got pregnant and my husband decided to start watching it on Netflix. I immediately loved it and wanted to watch the whole thing - all 8 seasons - before our baby was born. Well, that obviously didn't happen but we kept watching it even after our baby girl was born, until one day Netflix decided to remove ""The Cosby Show"" from the ""watch instantly"" feature and we had to stop. I was so frustrated that I decided I wanted to buy all 8 seasons of The Cosby Show - not only so that I could finish it, but also to be able to show it to my daughter when she's older! So, we purchased all 8 seasons and I'm so glad we did because we now own hours and hours of comedy that will always be timeless and entertaining.

Before I purchased from this seller, I looked at other sellers from which I could order the same product and have it shipped through Amazon Prime, however, their product was about $100.00 more expensive than from this seller, and it was the exact same product! Also, the shipping was faster than I expected and totally worth paying the $12.00 extra dollars. I'm very pleased with my purchase!",1331510400,3,1147,4.334883720930232

It seems that the content (although not ""bad"") in Seasons 5-6 is less appropriate for younger kids.  I'd be more comfortable letting my kids watch if they were 12+ yrs.  Seasons 1-4 are mostly great for younger kids with exception of a few episodes (i.e. drug themes, teen pregnancy themes, etc).

The four stars is just because the themes are more grown up b/c the kids in the show are more grown up (with exception of the new baby twins and the introduction of Olivia).  Overall a great family show!!!",1488585600,,611,4.509090909090909
