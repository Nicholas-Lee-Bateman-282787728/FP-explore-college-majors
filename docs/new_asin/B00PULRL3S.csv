8689319,4,B00PULRL3S,"The visual and audio quality of the DVD were great (Limited Edition Collection).  The movie itself is...interesting.  What impressed me the most was the fact that most of it was filmed at different locations in Hawaii.  There was no stock footage used.  That said, it is an odd movie.  I particularly liked Jean Engstrom as the interior designer who is attracted to Boris Karloff's secretary played by Beverly Tyler.  This character is really out of place in an American movie made in the 1950s.",1453161600,5,495,4.833333333333333
