344377,4,6301678036,"A little known, crude comedy in the vein of ""Porky's"" and ""Meatballs"". Filled with the kind of idiocy you can laugh at.",1393891200,,119,4.454545454545454
344378,1,6301678036,"In the late70'early 80's there were several comedy films made based around hijincks at summer camp , skiing , rafting/boat races , etc..... and they all seemed to follow a similar plotline where for what ever reason there is a competition going on and its make or break , that the good guys have to win or they lose some big prize , even Ernest P. Warrall jumped on the band wagon with a few of his own .

None of them were great , but they were funny , entertaining , and made you laugh at least once .

Most had at least one big named star , or s slew of up and coming stars , and in that regard , Gorp is no exception , its got at least a few faces that would go on to better things .

But one thing those other movies had that GORP didn't is a story .

The movie revolves around a summer camp , and is full of what I am sure is supposed to be amusing slapstick comedy , but nothing in it has a purpose , and it mixes comedic genre to the point of boredom . Some of the charaters are seemingly serious and normal , something you might see in the ""meatballs"" franchise , while others are absurd cartoons like we see in an Earnest P Warrall , and when put together , the characters clash , so rather than coming across as funny , it comes across as clumsy or poorly edited .

It doesn't have any discernible storyline , there is no set progression or contest or reason for any of the characters to do any of the many stupid things they do .

I am reminded of an interview I saw several years ago of a Disney animator , from the old days of Disney (1930-70's) . apparently Walt Disney offered a bonus for any skit or joke that they came up with to add to one of the cartoons or movies . But they only got paid if the idea was accepted and added to the movie .

This movie makes me think of that interview because it feels like the writers sat down and just wrote out every bit of toilet humor , slapstick gag , or joke they had seen or heard in other movies , and crammed it all into one without any real reason or plot to make it fit as part of the movie . In other movies , they make the material funny , in this one its just sad . I didn't laugh even once .

Nothing is original in this , its all just poorly copied ideas from other movies  .

Lots of stars have done movies early in their careers that they were not proud of , usually porn , but they can all hold their heads high IF they can honestly say ""atleast I wasn't in GORP"".

I say this as some one who like to watch movies to have fun , not as a real movie critic . I have about 700 movies on DVD , so I watch a lot of good movies , and a lot of bad ones .

This movie stands out in particular because I think it's the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen some really bad movies in my time .",1305590400,3,2765,3.8146853146853146

7813828,1,6301678036,"American International Pictures' desperate attempt to replicate the success of ""Animal House"" and ""Meatballs"" died a quick box-office death in the summer of 1980. Disposable teen-comedy garbage, ""Gorp"" ranks among the worst movies ever made. After years of well-deserved obscurity, Kino Lorber has resurrected this AIP last gasp for Dennis Quaid completists and the terminally curious.

7813829,1,6301678036,"Quite possibly the worst comedy ever made. Despite the valiant efforts of a cast of player who, for the most part, went on to better things, the script, at once inane and offensive, kills any possibility that this could move under its own power. It's dull, unfunny, and structured about as well as a Corvair. Avoid.",1458518400,2,315,4.642857142857143
