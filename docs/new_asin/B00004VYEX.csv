7924419,3,B00004VYEX,"This movie stars Vincent Lindon as Michel, a veteran French paparazzo chasing high-paying photo opportunities of celebrities in compromising situations.  One of Michel's photos causes Franck, played by Patrick Timsit, to lose his job.  Until Franck can find other work, Michel reluctantly agrees to let Franck assist on some photo stakeouts to earn some money.  What neither counted on was that Franck would be hooked on the adrenaline rush of being a paparazzo himself and insomuch, jeopardizes his family by throwing his scruples away and becoming a real dirtbag who is just interested in his own selfish desires. Patrick Timsit is very believable as an ordinary guy who by chance falls into this opportunity and is tempted by the money, the excitement, the unpredictability, and perks of the trade.  Throughout the movie, cameos of French celebrities are used.  My favorite was the cameo of Johnny Hallyday (French rock legend)--perhaps the highlight of the movie. This movie is a French drama with English subtitles.  Perhaps anyone who has watched someone close to them make a rapid metamorphosis with a sudden change in their behavior and personality due to a new position, or coming into money, or new relationship may like this movie.  Anyone fascinated by the paparazzi and what they do may also enjoy this movie.  If you are a fan of Vincent Lindon, you may also like this movie.  However, if you are looking for a good Vincent Lindon movie, Mes Amis Mes Amours (comedy), Je Crois Que Je L'Aime (comedy),  La Moustache (drama) and Mademoiselle Chambon (drama) are far better movies in my opinion.  I gave this movie three stars because it was okay--not great, but not bad either.",1402963200,,1689,4.996428571428571
7924420,3,B00004VYEX,"Alain Berberian's 1998 French comedy Paparazzi (not to be confused with the Mel Gibson-produced American revenge movie) feels like the kind of thing that Francis Veber would have made with Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard in the early 80s. Patrick Timsit is the `Pignon'-like sad sack who loses his job when Vincent Lindon's paparazzi gets a cover shot of a couple of celebrities that unfortunately shows Timsit at a football match when he should have been at work. Determined to find out the identity of the photographer, Timsit instead finds himself conned into becoming Lindon's flunky before gradually acquiring a taste for the hunt himself that threatens to overshadow his reluctant teacher. Naturally moral lessons are learned by the time the end credits roll and it's better on the various tricks of the trade - tip-offs, set-ups, cons, bribes and the odd bit of complicity with their more publicity-hungry prey - than it is at providing laughs, but it's an entertaining odd couple comedy which has enough good moments to pass muster. Of the supporting cast only Catherine Frot and Nathalie Baye have much to do while of the many cameos from local celebrities, only Isabelle Adjani and Johnny Hallyday will be remotely familiar to non-French audiences, though Patrick Bruel does give a brief master class in how to deal with a fledgling paparazzi. There's no real reason to watch it, but it passes the time more than pleasantly enough if you do.

The French PAL DVD has a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with English subtitles, though the extras are unsubtitled.",1201305600,3,1572,5.022988505747127
