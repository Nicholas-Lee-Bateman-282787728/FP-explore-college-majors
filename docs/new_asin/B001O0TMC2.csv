8328701,1,B001O0TMC2,I agree with the other reviewer. It is so incredibly annoying to have to sit there every single time you put this dvd on - to listen to the nonsense you listened to a million times before.  I don't know what the makers of this dvd were thinking.  Get another Thomas DVD because this is really annoying!!!,1298160000,,304,4.315789473684211
8328702,3,B001O0TMC2,"Like most of the Thomas DVDs, the stories on this DVD are fun, exciting (for a 2 year old) and full of great moments in Sodor.  Really, my son loves to see Thomas shooting by the other engines because of the jet engine and claps when everything ends well.

Now, on to why this DVD gets 3 stars instead of 4 or 5-- the menu.  Normally, I am pretty patient, you hit the DVD Menu button on the controller and wait a few seconds while it does its little intro dealy so you can choose the ""Play All"" choice.  HOWEVER, on THIS DVD, you have to wait through Sir Toppum Hat's speech AND through an explanation of each and every choice on the menu!  Seriously-- it IS annoying because there is NOTHING you can do to hurry it through or to bypass it!

All in all, if you don't think that would bother you, I really recommend this DVD!",1252022400,2,824,4.150943396226415
