I hadn't seen the performance in thirty years, and just by chance stumbled upon it on Amazon recently, thought I'd buy it and am so glad I did.  It's just charming to view glimses of life in long ago Williamsburg, Virginia.  To see the tradespeople at their chores, to see them dance and sing Christmas music. And Mr. Casual, Mr. Como, of course, is at the top of his game with his silky voice and comfortable demeanor. Effortlessly and naturally the songs unfold. I was so entertained, and often so touched by the sweet sentiment and joy of the show I didn't want it to end! Of course, there's a strong element of nostalgia; Como was an early television icon. But nobody did a Christmas Show as well or as tastefully or as polished as Como. An added attraction is John Wayne's presence in one of his last appearances. He displays that famous swagger of his, and his reading of an actual contemporary soldier's letter to his family describing his war experience and weariness from not being home, in that distinctly gravelly voice of the Duke, was touching beyond words. John Wayne gave special meaning and emotion to the letter, bringing it alive to the audience. The bottom line is this VHS is just lovely and worth owning. The technical quality of the show, which was produced on video tape originally, is crisp and full of colour.  This will surely become a Christmas tradition to look forward to in your family each coming year. I know it has become so in mine.",1355788800,5,1625,4.651567944250871

Not only did I see those wonderful Rankin-Bass shows (Rudolph, Drummer Boy, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, and The Year Without a Santa, etc.), but I loved the variety shows, too. Perry Como and Andy Williams were my favorites.
A couple of years ago, my mother ordered a double set of Perry Como Christmas videos: Early American Christmas and Christmas in Israel. I was overjoyed. The Early American Christmas video is set in Williamsburg, Virginia, and opens with a rousing adaptation of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas."" Boy, the memories sure flooded back as Perry takes the viewer through the colonial town. The people who work in the shops of Williamsburg are dressed in period costumes and show their trades (blacksmithing, glass blowing, candle making, haberdashery, baking, etc.)
I believe this show was filmed in 1978, so it looks a little dated; but if you're like me, and you love that retro look, you won't mind at all. This show features Miss America (1978 or 1979) and John Wayne, who died not long after this show was made. The songs are wonderfully sung by Perry and company, especially ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" and ""Ave Maria.""
I would highly recommend this 48-minute video to those of you, like me, who miss the variety shows (especially the Christmas ones) from the '60s and '70s.",975628800,19,1394,4.788381742738589
