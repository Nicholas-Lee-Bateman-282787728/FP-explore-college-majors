8614051,5,B00FBJLKAO,I rode this one about 160 times and when I went to Paris I barely needed a map.  I talked to the cyclist that did this Jan and begged him to do another one.  He said that it almost didn't happen because of the rain so he jerry rigged the camera to make it work.  You will a tiny bit of rain drops on the screen at times.... makes it more real to me.  This is the best one out there and wish there were more for Paris! My kids and I even put it on in the background  without biking when we need some Paris! Good music on this one too!,1502582400,,533,3.7232142857142856
8614052,5,B00FBJLKAO,Great when the weather is nasty and a ride out is not possible. I love the Giverny segment as I am a professional artist and that is Monet's home.,1462492800,,146,4.068965517241379
8614053,5,B00FBJLKAO,"I'm loving my Bike-O-Vision Paris & Giverney which is fun and interesting and takes the bite out of indoor riding.  The time flies by now when I spend an hour biking indoors.  The quality of the DVD is excellent, the music thereupon is engaging, typically French, and various tempos help me keep a moderate pace - not a fast pace though.  The scenery is highlights of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Arch of Triumph, the Bastille, the Seine, the Champs Elysee, and small rustic towns and scenery in the Giverny area.  I felt like I was seeing a good cross-section of Parisian culture.  The quality of the bike ride itself is more than adequate, excellent splicing at lights or traffic slowdowns and definitely felt like a continuous bike ride.  There is no talking on the DVD and only a few subtitles between tracks.  I had borrowed a few other Bike-O-Visions from the library before purchasing one.  All were of the same quality and I can't wait to buy some more.",1456790400,,961,4.6117647058823525

8614055,3,B00FBJLKAO,"Years back I purchased some Bike-O-Vision DVDs, and expected this new lot that I purchased recently to also be a proper DVD, but it is not!  It is a DVD-R and only one that I ordered (Yellowstone) is an actual DVD.  Why wasn't this specified in the description?  Some people might not be able to view DVD-Rs.  The content of this Paris one is nice, but not happy with the DVD-R aspect.",1407628800,,385,4.305555555555555
8614056,5,B00FBJLKAO,"Spouse and I really enjoyed indoor cycling together to this dvd!  The tour through Paris was exciting, realistic and downright fun!  Lived in Germany for almost 3 years (military dependent) but never got to Paris!  With this virtual dvd we feel like we had the opportunity to visit the popular sites thanks to this wonderful BOV tour.  There are no cons to this dvd: liked the country tour, Monet's estate, and the music too!  This is a winner!  :-) I recommend this dvd.",1405900800,,471,4.614457831325301
