I liked the movie cast better then the series, but some are well known to the Hallmark movies.  It would have been nice to see it go on longer.

Just one warning, it ends in a cliffhanger then the show got cancelled. Would love to have seen this show on T.V. for a long time or at least make a movie to tie up where the series left us with a cliffhanger.

I was hoping to see if they had a second season on here of dinotopia: the series, but to no avail, i have found none. Verry dissappointing...",1106352000,16,337,4.540983606557377
1958740,5,B0000YEE6W,"DINOTOPIA THE SERIES is another in the long line of television shows that were cancelled before they could fully blossom.  It is not by any means a deep, revelatory, challenging show.  If you are looking for accurate, Issac Asimov-style sci-fi... it ain't here.  What we're talking about is just an entertaining, fun show.  Some of the episodes could have been better, but overall... it was fun watching it.  It was way better than I expected... with good continuity from the miniseries.  You get lots of dino action (great effects), neat production design, and a good cast.  The characters are interesting. Originally I thought I would have a problem with the new actors (all are totally different from the mini-series), but I quickly grew to like them.  One thing... this show is not aimed at kids... its really for teenagers and up.  Nothing bad in it that I wouldn't show my 5 year old niece.  If you like LAND OF THE LOST, then you'll enjoy this series.  And it's a bargain .... 13 episodes for a great price.  The only thing is that the last episode ends with a huge cliff-hanger, and we'll never know what would have happened because ABC axed the show.  But then, I guess it wouldn't hurt us to use our brains to come up with our own ending, right? Bottom line... great price, many hours of enjoyment, good characters.. and great dinosaurs.  What more do you want?",1096675200,48,1371,4.634854771784233
1958741,2,B0000YEE6W,"I actually quite enjoyed the Dinotopia miniseries (in spite of the expected communist overtones), and was really thrilled to find out that there had been a continuation.  However, whereas the first series had a cohesive plot, this seems to be just one episode after another of characters acting interminably stupid (what kind of insane person would set off--with no water or food--in a rowboat, hoping to brave the open sea?).  The special effects are clearly done on a lower budget, the sets are straight out of a renfest, and the clean family nature of the first film is now peppered with innuendo.  There are some genuinely funny parts, and frequent enough to make the show watchable, but not enough to make it redeemable.  The ever-shifting cast (why not get the original actors?  And why is Romana Denison white in one episode and black in the next?) is comprised of mostly bottom-of-the barrel actors (with the exception of Jonathan Hyde and Sophie Ward, whom, admittedly, I have been fond of since Young Sherlock Holmes).  Or perhaps I'm being unfair.  It's hard for even the best actors to deliver bad lines over and over again.
I would like to see another series done, a continuation, even, but only with a different set of writers.  At least so far (I'm only on the first disc), I'm not terribly impressed.",1075593600,11,1316,4.792035398230088
1958742,5,B0000YEE6W,"I am a huge fan of the original ""Dinotopia"" mini-series, so when this show premeared on Thanksgiving day, 2002, I was one of the few fans who watched this instead of the popular programs airing at the same time slot, including ""Friends"" and ""Survivor."" ABC basically doomed the series by putting it up against some of the highest rated shows, and so it was cancelled only 6 weeks into the season. If you only watched the 2 hour premiere and decided you didn't like the series based on this, than you should really give it another shot. The new cast takes a little getting used to, but I now prefer them to the mini-series cast. And the storylines get much better as the series gets going. Most of my favorite episodes are the ones that never aired. ABC made a big mistake. I think this show would have attracted viewers if they aired it on Monday nights instead of Thursdays. After watching all three discs, I give the series 5 stars for how good the actual programming. However, the special features are terrible. They are all about the mini-series and not the series. It's as if Hallmark put bonus features they dubbed not worthy of being on the mini-series' DVD on here, just so it looked like you where getting more for your money. Another gripe I have is that the series ends with a cliffhanger. I hope Hallmark plans to continue the show on the Hallmark channel, because finishing the series makes me really want to know how it all ends. I'd settle for another mini-series. I've just gotta know the ending!",1074643200,81,1512,4.542124542124542

1958764,1,B0000YEE6W,"As a child, when I first set eyes on the book ""Dinotopia: A Land Apart From Time"" I was in love. I had always loved dinosaurs, and here was a book that was BEAUTIFULLY illustrated and very well written featuring a world where dinosaurs and humans lived together, working in harmony and maintaining a balance that would benefit all of its inhabitants. The best part was the level of detail that was presented, it swept you away and left you feeling utterly convinced that such a place really COULD exist, a world on par with the worlds presented in ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Dune"" and other such classics. A few years later, a second book joined the original ""Dinotopia: The World Beneath"", with a series of childrens books, and even two adult novels (both written by Alan Dean Foster) joined the series, each providing more detail, adventure and wonder, and my young mind consumed them.
  Flash forward to 2002, I turn on my television, afraid I've already missed the beginning of ""The Megaseries event"" I had been looking forward to for over a year, and sure enough, I missed the first five minutes, but it's on! Dinotopia has been adapted for the screen! I could hardly contain my excitement as I hit record and sat through all six hours. By the time it was over, I was both satisfied and disappointed, satisfied that I got to see dinosaurs, and some elements of the books incorporated into the ""Megaseries"" but disappointed in that those elements were very few and far between. As I grew older, that disappointment grew as I began to better realize just what had been done to the books I had come to love so much. The Dinotopians being turned into self righteous, controlling people, dictating the calling of others to them and criticizing them for not following their ways (very far from the portrayal in the books, where they were very accommodating, educating the dolphinbacks on their new surroundings and then attempting to help them find their own way in life, showing understanding during hard times), the carnivores being pretty much reduced to nothing but mindless creatures (despite Marion taking a quote from the original books in regards to Tyrannosaurs simply being hungry, something we see quite clearly as the large carnivores show themselves to be quite reasonable and even helpful later in the series), the same being true for the skybax being untamed and potentially dangerous, and don't even get me started on the sunstone debacle, or the many many many other major problems with the initial presentation of ""Dinotopia"". But then, as the ""Megaseries event"" ended, I saw the short promo for the coming series. Being completely in love with dinosaurs, regardless of my feelings for what I had just seen, I made a note to look out for it. Of course, that never came to be, it did not air when the promo said it would, and I was blissfully unaware of the five or six episodes that did air before it was cancelled.
  Perhaps it would have been better had I not found it in the local Fred Meyer for fifteen dollars, perhaps it would have been better had I not taken it home, ignored the fact that the insert was primarily coupons(a bad omen if I ever saw one), and promptly put the disc in the player then started watching the first episode, I think I would have saved myself a lot of pain and suffering as a result. I did not actually make it through the first episode to be honest, I only got so far before I had to turn it off, shocked at how mind numbingly bad it already was. This was supposed to be Dinotopia? Who on earth were these ""Outsiders""? Why were they there? They certainly never existed in the books, and wait... did the opening say a ""Strange storm""? Oh no... they're not actually going to try to portray the storm as ""magic"" are they? Ugh... yes they are. Look, when the reviewers of the books say it is a ""Magical place"" they don't mean that literally alright? The book series, while wondrous, did not have literal ""magic"" anywhere in its pages. But of course that won't stop the plot of the opening two part episode from being about a magical glowing green talisman that somehow suppresses the sunstones (which... ugh... never worked that way to begin with), then makes these mindless Tyrannosaurs obey the person who holds it, which happens to be the leader of these ""Outsiders"", after they discover a cave with carvings regarding an ancient ""god"" of tyrannosaurs, accompanied by some of the worst dialogue I have heard in a long time. ""You see these? The snakes, the lightning, it's like a warning, and these people here, the guy with the dinosaur head, a god of T-rexes!"" *Shudders* Just awful, and that's just in the first ten minutes! It really never gets any better from there, though many of the actors are wonderful actors, the writers choose to focus not on the incredible and detailed world of the books, but instead on formulaic, lazy story lines that seem to almost always focus on Carl and his father always trying to either escape from Dinotopia, or trying to make the island more like the rest of the world, while their amazing technology seems to win over the suddenly VERY impressionable and not-too-bright people of Dinotopia (in itself groan worthy), or they focus on the outsiders, who again, never existed and were absolutely even remotely necessary, as sources of conflict they are cliched at best (usually just trying to party whenever possible), and at worst, completely distract from the many many wondrous stories they COULD have written instead. We never see Volcaneum, Sauropolis (the true capital of Dinotopia), we never see the Hadro Swamp, so much that could and should have been explore or at least MENTIONED (though Volcaneum did get mentioned in the original ""Megaseries""). The series simply plods along with a string of uninspired, episodes which rely FAR too much on cliches and ""magic"" leading to the worst insult at the final episodes *spoiler alert* featuring yet again more ""magic"" (GAR!) and an object that creates a portal back to the real world.
  At the very least the original ""Megaseries"" looked beautiful, the CGI really wasn't bad for the scope of the world they were showing, and made more of an effort to let you see at least part of Dinotopia, even if it was vastly misrepresented, but you saw it. Honestly I wanted to like this, I wanted to LOVE it, but I simply cannot, the writers seem to have completely missed the point and spirit of the books that spawned them. One could, I supposed argue that with a smaller budget the writers would have to resort to simpler story lines in order to keep the series going, or that it would be hard to write stories based in a utopia without some sort of trouble. I would counter however,  with the fact that the childrens series actually told many very good stories, in a way that could actually have been filmed very easily with the smaller budget. With that I conclude this review with the suggestion that if you re interested in this series, skip the DVD's, go to the library and find the books instead, I think you will find them a lot more fullfilling, creative and imaginative, with MUCH better writing.",1394409600,,7137,4.686602870813397
1958765,4,B0000YEE6W,I remembered seeing part of this show on TV and I wanted to finish watching it because it had caught my interest. It's doesnt have the greatest special effects but in all the story line is amusing to me.,1394064000,,203,4.230769230769231
1958766,5,B0000YEE6W,I was very pleased with my order.  My order exceeded my expectations. I watched the movie and the series when they aired on television.  I liked them.  I was happy to find the series on DVD.  I already had the movie on DVD.  Now I have both.,1390435200,,241,4.042553191489362

1958768,5,B0000YEE6W,Loved this show when it originally came out and now glad to share it with my kids. Nice special effects with the dinosaurs and the story is interesting.,1388880000,,152,4.464285714285714
1958769,4,B0000YEE6W,"I first watched this series when it originally aired on ABC, and each week it was on, felt like a legitimate event. At the time, for a 7 year old, this was the most incredible show I've ever seen. And here in the US, only 6 of the 13 episodes aired. You can imagine my disappointment. Thankfully, the complete series was released on dvd. How does the series hold up after almost a decade? Pretty well actually, but there are some flaws. First off, the dialogue is awful at times, and I wish the story-lines were better in most episodes, I can't help but see it as wasted potential. You read James Gurney's amazing series, with these unbelievably lavish and imaginative paintings, and having the opportunity seeing the books come to life as a weekly series, you'd think this would be brilliant television, and I wish I could say it was. Also, for the most part, the dinosaurs just sort of.. walk around, while in the books, they're more interacting with the humans, I wish the filmmakers could have gotten a little more creative on that. One more gripe I have is the lack of variation of species. There aren't any new species from the original mini-series, which I find to be disappointing. It could have lead to the possibility of our protagonists adventuring out, and maybe discovering a carnivore that poses a huge threat to Dinotopia, and they're immune to the power of the sunstones. I think a storyline like that could be very well, since the takes are really high. Now I don't have all negatives to say about this series. First off, the acting is pretty good, the standout performance for me is Shiloh Strong, portraying David Scott, a huge improvement from Wentworth Miller, who would basically just complain and was helpless for most of the film. And some of the story-lines are interesting, the best story based episodes for me are ""Contact"", ""Lost and Found"", ""Night of the Wartosa"", ""The Cure parts 1/2"" and ""Crossroads"", and I must admit, the special effects still are very impressive for the most part. All in all, if you liked the miniseries, I'd say check this out. I wish this made it to a second season. Flawed? Yes. Perfect? No. Entertaining? Yes.

1958793,4,B0000YEE6W,"Granted, the acting in this series isn't the best, and the special effects look a decade old. Nonetheless, Dinotopia manages to be somewhat more than a forgettable kid's show. It does try to take character development seriously and you grow to like them the more you watch them. Some of the characters really seem to grow and change with time. The father, Frank Scott, is particularly compelling, always full of energy and torn between searching for a way home and making the best of life on Dinotopia. Some of the stories always play with the tension between the modern world and a traditional culture, but in a more nuanced way than most movies. While Dinotopia is portrayed as adhering to idealistic, upright moral codes, it's not perfect. The stories explore some of the problems that regularly occur in a traditionalist, isolated society and shows how events challenge that moral code. It's just a shame that the CG dinosaurs don't look even as realistic as the earlier DInotopia mini-series. Overall, this series should appeal to Dinotopia fans and kids of any age who like dinosaurs.",1333152000,,1090,4.929347826086956

The TV series spinoff is beautifully filmed, with all the believability that the CGI dinos produced in the miniseries. But true to the books or even the miniseries it is not, and I found it a little disturbing that instead of ""breathe deep, seek peace"", this version of Dinotopia is concentrating more on the human violence and vices of the outside world than the one created by James Guerney. As for the intelligent dinosaurs, I thought there would be more roles for them, but instead we get the soap opera love triangle, constantly rampaging T. Rexes, a Matriarch who goes from a  pillar of strength to a bit of a wimp, and focus on lawless group of brigands (an entire clan, led by a Xena-like female outlaw, had to replace the  Crabbs I guess).

1958804,3,B0000YEE6W,"Hallmark's Dinotopia, the series is reasonably entertaining for the whole family and the current price warrants consideration. The story is about a father and his two sons flying over the ocean in their small private plane when they hit a storm and crash. They end up on a beach but on an Island that isn't on any known map. When they find people they are considered guests and treated well. All seems relatively normal until they see Dinosaurs, some which can talk. The rest the series revolves around the boys becoming active in the Dinotopian society by getting an education and taking on responsibilites such as raising a dinosaur and flying on one. I was not overly impressed the first time I saw half the miniseries but on my second viewing I actually enjoyed it. I recommend the ""Dinotopia - The Miniseries"" and the ""Dinotopia - The Series"". Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Earthsea"".

They still did not show alot of blood, but it was too scary for my youngest to watch and I was nervous about a couple of the next youngest having nightmares.

But seriously, the series is actually really good.  It's got a lot of action, the acting is pretty good, and the FX are impressive. The one thing that I was unhappy about was the special features.  I had expected them to be more about the series and less about the origional mini series.  I was sorely mistaken.  They were, as it seems, also more geared towards a younger audience, which kind of made me feel like the narration was meant for a 5yr old.

1958816,4,B0000YEE6W,"My son (now 10) and our family fell in love with the original Emmy award winning Dinotopia mini-series with it's 'all star' cast. That's also available as two DVD set edited into a superb long film with interesting 'making of' extras. My son absolutely couldn't tolerate this spin off series when they changed all the actors, and has only just started watching it a year or two after we bought it on DVD. He really likes the series now (as he admits he has forgotten what the orginal cast were like).

This Dinotopia series has a more jocular mood with the old charactor's presented in a more likeable way than the original moody and angry or pious (bordering on pompous in the Mayor's case) tone of the original. However I preferred the darker original style, and missed classy Brit's Katie Carr and Jim Carter as the Dinotopians and American's Wentworth Miller and David Thewlis as the believable in-fighting step-brother's coping with their sudden change of lifestyle and recent loss of their father. I also really, really missed Lee Evans as dinosaur Zippo's voice, Terry Jone's as the messenger's birds voice and Tyron Leitso as hustler Cyrus Crabb. However I really like the fact this Dinotopia series DVD set has all the episodes listed seperately so that the cliffhanger, end music and titles remain, greatly helping to set the pace. I felt the merging of the original mini-series into a single very long film on DVD was less succesful than keeping the episodes seperate as screened - which also allows an episode before bed-time for the kids.

The 'unknown' new cast of this spin-off series make a good go of it though, but I do find the change of mood and cast very annoying. I wish they had just bought in completely new character's with this new cast and ignored the previous mini-series. But of course any Dinotopia is better than nothing. Other than the whinges above, this is a very fun series, less serious and Dino-preaching than the original and with more of the Pirate's of the Caribbean feel (as it now has pirates). It is therefore probably well suited to older pre-teens and young teenagers (probably boys mainly). Once we get going, I'm sure we'll all enjoy the series, as on TV we kept missing vital episodes. This 3 DVD set has all 13 episodes listed separately plus a few 'featurettes' on making Dinotopia etc... So overall, very recommended, particularly as no more promised Dinotopia seems to have materialised. We got it very cheap via Amazon resellers.",1166745600,4,2482,4.796728971962617
1958817,1,B0000YEE6W,"James Gurney's Dinotopia is a unique children's book; a Progressive utopia of cooperation and environmentalism.  It's a dramatically different take on standard adventure fare that deserved to be developed, rather than dumbed down. Perhaps that's inevitable for TV. However it's sad to see the concept of a pacifistic, diverse culture communing with nature and celebrating cooperation turned into a show about a primitive society wowed by such innovations as boxing, motorcars, and rock-and-roll. The movie is equally disappointing in presenting  pacifists who must be rescued by roguish rule breakers, and the tv show simply follows that line. It's a tragic waste of a great possibility to do something really different with an adventure series.

Following the film's lead we are in Dinotopia a century after the books, with stranded brothers Karl and David Scott (Erik von Detten and Shiloh Strong) and their father Frank (Michael Brandon) trying to accomodate to an island shared between humans and (mostly) intelligent dinosaurs.  Cyrus Crabbe is replaced as plot driver by ""the Outsiders,"" rebels against the Dinotopian codes who eat meat and use weapons. Their piratical nature made them more interesting to the writers than the 'boring' pacifists of Dinotopia, so they dominate the series episodes:

In the two-part series opener (MAROONED, MAKING GOOD) the Outsiders discover a magic amulet that enables them to control tyrannosaurs and the brothers must stop them from conquering all of Dinotopia.

HANDFUL OF DUST, the third episode, has a dinosaur-killing alchemist making sexy Outsider queen LeSage (Lisa Zane) even younger.

In episode 4, CONTACT, roguish Karl must choose whether to use a radio to escape Dinotopia or to rescue the dying survivors of a shipwreck.

THE MATRIARCH, Episode 5, contemplates the challenging issue of a pacifist mother whose children disappear in a tyrannosaur attack, but fudges the ending dishonestly.

BIG FIGHT was the last episode of the series to air in the U.S.; semi-pacifistic David agrees to box an Outsider bully, a situation quickly exploited both by Frank and LeSage.

NIGHT OF THE WARTOSA is at last something semi-consistent with the Dinotopian ideal and fun (although it does indeed involve some sexual innuendo); it's a GROUNDHOG DAY ripoff.

In Episode 8 LESAGE hijacks a dinosaur-load of medicine; Karl's roguery in getting it back is almost too much for Marion (Georgina Rylance).

In CAR WARS Frank invents a motorcar and ousts Waldo (Jonathan Hyde) from office on a pro-progress platform(!?!)

In LOST AND FOUND Karl's attempt to sneak a ride on a skybax leads a vengeful Frank and a courageous Waldo to the discovery of a lost city of cowboys.

In the two-part THE CURE, Karl's illness leads Rosemary (Sophie Ward) to use magic to send David and LeSage to the outside world.

CROSSROADS is the series finale; however it's a cliffhanger and not a conclusion to the series.  Knowing that they can now leave Dinotopia, the Scotts must decide what they really want, while Marion must decide who she wants to be.

The acting is mostly good, although the tv Marion-role doesn't allow Rylance to compete with the movie's Katie Carr, and Hyde makes for a VERY different Waldo than Jim Carter. I also vastly preferred the movie's Lee Evans to the series' Omid Djalili as the voice of ""Zipeau."" The SFX aren't cutting edge, but survivable. The occasional clever ideas tend to get lost in largely formulaic plots, and the tension between the brothers that really MADE the movie has completely disappeared: Marion now seems to be ""Karl's girl."" The dialogue is pedestrian and characterization tends to be pretty broad.",1153094400,12,3670,5.161888701517706

8004382,4,B0000YEE6W,"Dinotopia was at one time (for all I know might still be) a popular series of children's books, where a society of humans lives in harmony with a society of intelligent dinosaurs. In this miniseries, after a plane crash two brothers are marooned on the Dinotopia island, and must go through the process of learning a new way of life and a new set of philosophies about life. They arrive in a time of conflict, as not ALL the dinosaurs are so friendly. The TV series follows a TV movie which sets up the premise.

The story is engaging, characters are well formed and interesting, the acting is competent, and the special effects are pretty good for a TV production. My only knock on the special effects is that certain sequences are used over and over again. Evidently their budget ran a bit short.

I bought this as a present for our ten year old granddaughter, who particularly enjoyed it, and that was the important consideration. I didn't find any age inappropriate material. Violence was present but in control. The plot had enough meat to interest the adults watching along with her, but was not at all difficult for her to follow.

8004385,4,B0000YEE6W,"After reading Jim Gurney's first Dinoptopia book, and being enchanted, I wanted to watch the two TV series. The first mini-series is on backorder, but I was able to get this 13-episode series, and really liked it. The four stars instead of five is because of the unfair cliffhanger ending. They should have come up with something...anything...to tie up the plot and give watchers some resolution. The dinosaurs were so well-done, and really, all the visuals were stunning. My only dinosaur quibble was that the T-Rexes were portrayed as horror-movie monsters, which was not the way Jim Gurney presented them in his book. And I would have liked to have seen the dinosaurs such as Zippeau or the baby one having more important roles. (Probably would have taken too much away from the human actors though.) The writing could be a little weak, but it was only the first season, and the series really was not given the chance it needed to find its feet and move forward into the next season. I really wish it had been given more of a
chance. I think this could have been a successful series. I agree with another reviewer who said this was more for teens than for younger children, but there is no reason younger kids couldn't watch it.",1474329600,3,1231,4.651376146788991
