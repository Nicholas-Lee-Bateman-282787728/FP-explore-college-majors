8003456,1,B0000V499W,"This 2 DVD set is simply one of those public domain rehashes of this wonderful classic and very funny TV series. What we have here are some select episodes from this long running show that are not only remastered sloppily, but have cut off that very recognizable theme song The Ballad of Jed Clampett and replaced it with a banjo riff that is very shoddily performed and when it comes to the closing credits, they simply tag on the wrong ones and it doesn't even match who were in the episodes playing all the guest starring roles. Of course, we still see the names of the immediates like Bea Benaderet, Paul Winchell. Frank Wicox and even Raymond Bailey, Harriet E. MacGibbon and Nancy Kulp, but really don't match the other guest stars.

I understand that the theme song The Ballad of Jed Clampett is copyrighted, but the company that distributed these, Platinum Disc Corporation, still could have the copyright to the theme song loaned to them for the purpose of this DVD set release.

If you want a remarkable remastering of these first season and the first half of the second season episodes, get MPI's The Beverly Hillbillies The Ultimate Collection's Volumes One and Two and also, the MPI DVD of The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Christmas. With them, you get the whole first season and half of the second season digitally remastered from the original negatives that were authorized by the Paul Henning estate as they had the original rights to the original negatives of all those wonderful first and second season episodes of this wonderful and still funny as heck show. With those, you don't need this or any of them shoddy Public Domain DVD releases.",1326240000,,1669,4.811846689895471
