8188764,5,B000GKMWPU,"I really liked the story but I agree it was stretched out a bit. I also think the lead actors (Bae Yong Joon and Lee Young-A) were both too young to play these parts. The characters are supposed to be in their mid 30's with established carriers. The actors are barely 22 or 23 years old at the time they made this movie and they don't even look that old. If this story were made now, they would be perfect.

Both of the child actors the main source of comedy in the show and steal the spotlight from the older actors from time to time.",1224460800,3,535,4.095238095238095
8188765,2,B000GKMWPU,The best thing I liked about this movie was the lead actress's clothes and the cute children. The storyline just did not do it for me. I was disappointed. Sorry.,1183507200,2,161,4.4
