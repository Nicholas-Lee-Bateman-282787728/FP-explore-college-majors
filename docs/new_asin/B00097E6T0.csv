I wasted my time by watching and buying this product. I highly recommend DO NOT BUY this film. If I can, I will rate zero to the left!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-the-Shogun/dp/B00097E6T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill the Shogun</a>",1331769600,,418,6.084745762711864
8057858,4,B00097E6T0,"This movie is as described correctly by reviewer above N Wolfe, and thanks for the review as it help me to find this movie ive been searching for. I have to say in my opinion it is one of my all time favourite old school martial arts movies. I have the original uncut version on VHS witch I had rendered it to a SVCD as Mpeg2 format out of fear of VHS tape becoming damaged with age. It has a good plot one that keeps you interested the whole way giving you that inspiration feeling of good. The main actors martial arts is great, kicks like a trooper through the whole movie. One major disappointment is that the last 4min of the ending had been cut out of edit, leaving you with written text advising end result of the movie being something other than original edit complete huge massive mistake and I say shame, shame to the reproducer of this DVD as the last 4min was what made the movie unforgettable. Lucky for me I have the original version to watch however its new viewers miss out, the big mistake on editor part. If I can fine the original uncut version available on DVD digitally remastered I would instantly purchase it.",1180742400,,1132,4.369668246445498
8057859,1,B00097E6T0,"There may be another movie out there with this same title that matches the product description given, but this movie is actually set in the 1904 occupation of Korea (by Japan, of course). An incident is sparked when the Japanese force the Korean soldiers to strip off their uniforms. Two of the Korean soldiers refuse and go on a rampage against the Japanese, forcing them to take their uniforms off.

Plot doesn't play a huge role in this film, because basically every plot point exists as an excuse for a fight. There is plenty of fighting, but little good fighting. I mean, there is no Jackie Chan or Jet Li in this film. While the main character is athletic enough, the fighting is extremely sloppy (which is probably due to the fight choreographer).  As a matter of fact, while the Koreans are supposed to be defeating the Japanese with their powerful Tae Kwon Do, very little Tae Kwon Do is to be seen in this movie. I know this because I practiced it for ten years, and there was no recognizable style involved in this film.

The acting is ridiculous, the action is ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. Also, if there was originally a music track, there's pretty much none left in the film. It's almost entirely absent. Fortunately this all combines to make one of those ridiculously bad movies that you can laugh at enough to make it worth watching.

Also, if you're willing to look in the bargain bin, you may be able to find this DVD at Wal-Mart for $1.50. It's really not worth much more than that. If you're just looking for a decent Kung-Fu movie to pass the time with though, this is certainly no Kung-Fu classic. Go for any Jackie Chan or Jet Li or Chow Yun-Fat, or heck, most anything else.",1151020800,2,1709,4.5210355987055015
