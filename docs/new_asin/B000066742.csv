1711854,5,B000066742,"When this little film  turned up in 1975 I was living in one of the few cities it was first released to.  I remember sitting in a huge theatre with 9 other people and we were all howling our heads off.  The run was about 2 weeks and I saw this movie 11 times.  In the ensuing years I taped it on cable.  My video tape is wearing out and this DVD is like Christmas Day.
The main feature is in remarkably good shape.  In an interview writer, director and producer Bruce Kimmel said that the master was literally unusable in some areas.  It had to be completely rebuilt.  The joys of the digital age. In a nutshell it centers around a movie studio that is going to be reposessed unless they put on a movie that is a success.  The brilliant young head of the studio decides a porno nude film  would put them in the black. One of the creditors insists that his nephew direct the film.  Just the beginning of the trouble.  A colorful, funny group of characters sing and dance their way across the screen for 94 minutes.  It is a truly funny movie. ""Dancing Dildos"" is a hoot.
Also on this DVD is the standard photo gallery, theatrical trailer.  However a ""making"" of the film documentary is very funny indeed.  Great interviews and film scenes with Cindy Williams, Bruce Kimmel, Stephen Nathan and others associated with the film.  Rumor has it that Ms Williams wanted to buy every print of the film after Laverne and Shirley became popular.
Also included in this deluxe package is a cd of the soundtrack.  It has a very funny, bright melodious score.  In fact, it would make a great Broadway musical.  What a novel idea.
If you want to have a fun 2 hours watch ""The First Nudie Musical"".",1025136000,6,1682,4.367741935483871
1711855,5,B000066742,"The negative for the First Nudie Musical has been lost and the transfer was taken from an existing prints. The visible evidence that it was taken from print rather than a negative is during the reel changes. The excellent telecine transfer must be mentioned, as the colors are rich and vibrant. They are far superior to the older video releases. The sound is mono, but in the earlier seventies so were the majority of the films made at the time.
The film was the brainchild of Bruce Kimmel who wrote, composed the score and directed the majority of the film with Mark Haggard. Kimmel also stars in the film as the inept director John Smithee. He has an infectious laugh and plays his role with the similar expert timing he displayed on his many guest-starring roles on 70's sitcoms.
Stephan Nathan, Diana Canova (Soap) and Cindy Williams just months shy of the role that would make her famous in Laverne and Shirley also star in the film. Canova plays Juanita an aspiring actress and singer who has the thickest Cuban accent this side of Ricky Ricardo. Nathan is a very able song and dance man as he displayed in the original New York productions of Godspell and in the film version of 1776 singing the controversial ""Mama, Look Sharp"". Cindy Williams a very able comedic actress with great comic timing who appeared in such diverse roles in Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, American Graffiti, Travels With My Aunt and Mr. Rico. John Kirby's scene stealing work as the very bad nudie film actor in the deleted Plumber Scene is another highlight.
 The rest of the cast is filled with young raw talent and they memorable sidesplitting turn by Susan Stewart as Joy Full. Everyone has his or her moment to shine. Leslie Ackerman plays the fresh off the bus Wanna-be-star who has no idea what a nudie film or what a lesbian is; Alan Alebew as the leading man trying to pick up all the women in the film, Alexandra Morgan as Mary LaRue the Faye Dunaway of nudie Films. Look out for a young Susan Buckner as a singing and dancing prostitute (Later to appear as Patty in the film version of Grease) and Joel Blum who went on to be a Tony Nominated actor on Broadway.
Two interesting side notes: Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent of WB's Smallville) and Debbie Shapiro (later Debbie Shapiro Gravitte and then Debbie Gravitte) were two of the more notable ghost singers a la Marni Nixon.
The hilarious songs and dialogue by Kimmel obviously inspired the South Park creators' Trey Parker and Matt Stone in their offbeat songs and humor in their films South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut and Orgazmo. This includes the ""infamous"" words uttered by Cindy Williams so lovingly, ""stunt co**"" that found their way into their films. Kimmel was the first and therefore has the freshest take on the material. The film is briskly edited to 97 minutes.
The DVD has commentary by Kimmel, Williams and Nathan on one track of the film, Kimmel and Nick Redman, and Michael Rosendale on the other. There is also commentary on the deleted scene and musical scene. And what might be a first an audio commentary on the making of documentary features.
All will have an enjoyable time and is highly recommended.",1025136000,9,3183,4.694096601073345
1711856,2,B000066742,"My DVD must have come from the same batch as the viewer in Alexandria (though mine isn't a screener, I actually purchased mine)!  The DVD isn't all that.
Let me start by saying that I've been a big fan of Bruce Kimmel's work since I purchased my first Spotlight Series CD.  So of course I couldn't wait to purchase this DVD, and yes, now I (unfortunately) own it.  Somehow, this wasn't what I was expecting.  I have a sense of humor just as much as the next person, but didn't expect Mr. Kimmel's work to be quite so perverted.  I mean, you have an idea of what to expect hence the title, but give me a break!  It was disappointing to hear Mr. Kimmel's music, not what I'd expect of him, you'd think he would have so much talent, but obviously song writing isn't his strong suit.  So beware when purchasing this DVD, it's not something I'd ever want to see again to tell you the truth.  It's too bad, since I was really looking forward to it.",1024963200,3,942,4.252808988764045
1711857,3,B000066742,"As with the original Little Shop of Horrors, technical quality is not the issue here. This silly little film represents at least a minor landmark in cinema history and now that it's available on DVD, everyone can judge for themselves.  Schlock doesn't begin to describe the technical aspects, but Cindy Williams is a delight as Rosie the Secretary, giving a performance alternately subtle and outrageous. Years of Laverne and Shirley may have done more harm than good to her overall reputation, but this film shows that she could have been the equal of Goldie Hawn in films.
Lots of special features in the DVD (including several Easter Eggs), but grab one soon, as the bonus soundtrack CD will not be included in later pressings.",1024963200,2,730,4.887096774193548
1711858,5,B000066742,"Well, I too got a screener of this.  I love this movie and this transfer so blows away any previous video versions it's unbelievable.  I don't know what the ""viewer"" from Virginia's problem is, but I would have to say he should have his eyes examined.  Of course, it doesn't look like a film that was made yesterday - it does have occasional wear, but the color is great and it's sharp (and anamorphic).  Having listened to one of the commentary tracks, this was a very very low budget film - shot in 35mm but really cheap.  It's not going to look like Spiderman.  Anyway, I laughed throughout - and the documentary is hilarious.  Haven't looked at the other features yet but have already found an Easter Egg, which is pretty cool.",1023321600,9,731,4.492424242424242
1711859,3,B000066742,"Movie rates 3 of 5 stars; DVD transfer rates 4stars.

FNM is probably the strangest movie to have debuted in 1976.
The biggest name star is Cindy Williams.  She had just come
off a feature role in that star-maker, American Graffiti, and did not need the billing and salary to make ends meet.  Was she contractually committed to this turkey role?

She plays it deadpan throughout, and looked as though she wanted to be anywhere but on the movie set.  However, her approach really worked.  She was a hoot, intentionally or otherwise. Diana Canova was another familiar performer; she sported the phoniest Latin accent in movie history. Neither ""name star"" actually gets naked - be forewarned.

The movie is suitably low-budget, and especially costuming -
in all its jiggling glory.  True to its title, it is a musical.  ""Dancing Dildoes"" is the number that says it all.  The chorerograhy and lyrics sound like a third grader's first attempt at staging.  The sight of a chorus line of condoms prancing about is painfully memorable.

DD was unusual because the chorus line was costumed. Most other
scenes had naked ladies.  In fact, the Stunt C*ck was possibly the
only naked male.

Am I glad I went?  Well, I had just been discharged from the
Air Force.  Some of the enlisted guys dragged me to the theater;
I think they needed their ex-captain to cover their evening out.

I will never forget the scene in which the director tells a perfectly
lovely blonde, of course stark naked, to fake an orgasm.  Truly
dreadful acting was never funnier.  Then too, the reaction from guys
in the unit also lent humor to the moment.

So, you pays your money and takes your chances on this one.
There are some knock-down funny, arse-grabbing bits in this film.

You just might hate yourself in the morning though.  All the actresses are now in their middle-50's and probably grandmothers by now.  I keep wondering if they dread the thought of their grandchildren discovering this movie and outing them.",1246060800,3,1984,4.770588235294118
1711860,5,B000066742,when this movie first came out i paid $89.95 for the video......created memerble moments from the movie in shows that i choregraped for charites. know on dvd is a thrill'''''''''',1242259200,,179,5.0
1711861,4,B000066742,"I first saw this movie on Showtime back in the late Seventies or early Eighties, and tried to find it on tape for years afterwards. Very funny, and I LOVED seeing Ron Howard (uncredited) and Cindy Williams in the same film pre-Happy Days/Laverne & Shirley. I have frequently tried to describe this film to my friends, and been frustrated. Even singing ""Dancing Dildoes Are We"" didn't convey the hilarity. Now I can show them!! You should see it too.

If you truly love the bizarre bellylaugh in film, run ""The First Nudie Musical"" as a double feature with ""The Forbidden Zone"" by Richard Elfman. You will laugh all night long.",1189987200,3,626,4.6909090909090905
1711862,3,B000066742,"After knowing about this film for over twenty years, I finally got a chance to see it.  As a consumer reporter, the first thing the public needs to know is that Cindy Williams does not get naked in it.  She's cute as a button, and carries the film in the female lead.  You are kind of hoping she does disrobe in the final scene, but no, like Sarah Jessica Parker in ""Sex in the City"", she leaves this to the other ladies in the cast.

That disappointment aside, the film is very enjoyable to watch.  Although filmed as the filming of a porno film, there is no actual pornography in it.  There is, however, a very good amount of nudity sprinkled throughout, with attractive people in these roles, to keep that part of your interest going. For those wanting to view it from that angle, you won't be disappointed, and frankly, there is a lot more than your average R-rated film of today.

The reason for my title is that another reason to like the film is that you are rooting for the good guys to win.  The plot is the same as thousands of films before it, in that something needs to be accomplished by a certain deadline, or something is going to be lost. So we have the usual problems that happen throughout the production, many of them predictable, but many of them humerous.  The movie has it's share of one-dimensional stock characters, but the leads are done professionally, with a lot of wit and charm.

Also, the songs and chorerography are much higher than you would expect in a film like this.  There are several songs that get you hooked on first listening.  While predictable, you enjoy the movie for the people who are in it.",1171238400,4,1636,4.434782608695652
1711863,5,B000066742,"In these times, when an American Taliban consisting of victim feminists, conservatives, fundamentalists, and just plain prudes are trying to force all women into chadors and burkas, it is refreshing that one can still obtain a video showing any nudity.  Enjoy it while you can, because, like a boa constrictor tightening its coils every time its prey exhales, the Supreme Court has been putting the squeeze on nudity every since Nixon denounced the 1970 Presidential Commission's Report and appointed five right wing ideologues to the Court.  That Report, based on an exhaustive study, concluded that there was no evidence that even the most sexually explicit materials caused any harm or even modified men's attitudes.  It also concluded that government should get out of the censorship business.  Instead, the Court abandoned both of its ""bedrock"" principles:  to remain content neutral and to demand proof that expression represents a imminent and serious harm to a compelling government interest, that the remedy will reduce the harm, and that there is no readily available alternative with that would abridge 1st Amendment freedom less or no time to search for a less suppressive measure.  It has returned to the ""bad tendency"" excuse used to jail ""Commies"" in the 1920s, adopted the ludicrously vague ""compelling interest""of protecting the moral fabric of society, put all sexual expression just above obscenity on a sliding scale of value, okayed discrimination against certain kinds of sexual expression on the basis of content, allowed juries to make law as well as find guilt or innocence, upheld laws that invade that make it a crime to possess certain sexual materials, split live performances into ""conduct"" and ""expression""components, then allowing suppression of the latter on grounds that the former is ""associated with"" certain ""secondary effects""and requiring no proof of the association other than the sayso of local the usual suspect testimony of officials, fundamentalists, and other ""concerned"" groups, etc., etc., etc.  Today, so afraid of sellers of sexual materials of any sort that stores like Publix put dark plastic covers over Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Elle, and other women's magazines.  Sorry for the soapbox, but abridgment of the 1st Amendment is a serious matter.  Yet, if a stage performance can be censored on the basis that it is part conduct, so can the press, for such aspects as data entry are acts the government can justify controlling on the basis that it causes crime as a ""secondary effect"" and the government has a ""compelling interest"" in  coltrolling the crime.  That Amendment says that government ""will pass no law ... abriding freedom of speech.""  Ditto freedom of press.  What is it about ""no"" that the Court, legislators, and people don't understand?  The Court's blatent disregard for the Constitution may explain why polls consistently show that Americans have no respect for lawyers.  At a Time when Americans are dying in a war against the Taliban and other usurpers of liberty, it is ironic that back home, our own Taliban is winning. This movie-video shows, however, that the flag is still there, torn, sullid, and shot full of holes, maybe, but still there.",1142208000,2,3212,5.209708737864077
1711864,3,B000066742,"The title sounded interesting so I thought it was worth a look and although not the best film I've ever seen, it was certainly one to see.
Charming and well thought out movie that should remain a cult movie for the next 25 years too.
The plot is basically a film in a film.  We watch as a crazy team attempt to put on the world's first sex musical.  The film is certainly more comedy than porn so don't be put off.  Give it a try.",1034380800,7,430,3.9767441860465116
1711865,5,B000066742,"This is my all-time favorite film!
The First Nudie Musical has held its own for all these years by word of mouth and undoubtedly many pirated copies on vhs made the rounds since it was so hard to find.  Even Paramount let it go to at least two other video companies I know of, and the last vhs release of it a few years ago was a collector's item in the fact that it contained the ""plumber scene"" which is now included on this DVD release as part of the deleted scenes.  It's so good to see that people have cherished this film and are doing it great justice by giving us so much on this DVD.
I have been a true fan of this modest classic, telling everyone I know about it and forcing them to see it.  No one to this day has been disappointed, especially if you appreciate extreme camp and honest to goodness silliness.  The film is aware of its own low budget and uses that to its advantage, as one film critic once said ""it was made for one percent of the budget of New York, New York and is a hundred times funnier!""  It transcends the boundaries of a T&A comedy by actually appealing to anyone with a giddy sense of humor, straight or gay.  Cindy Williams has always had a special place in my heart after seeing her performance in this film, she is top-notch here!  SHE makes this film a complete experience, besides the charming and very funny Diana Canova's character of Juanita Juanita.  And watch out for that very funny brief cameo by Ron Howard!
The early pressings of the DVD contain the soundtrack on CD -- what a welcome sight since I have held on to my vinyl copy of the soundtrack since it was released in 1977! Many will want this especially for the fact that Annette O'Toole was the singing voice behind the song The Lights And The Smiles! This may sound corny, but with the DVD release of The First Nudie Musical and its soundtrack right now, I feel life has come full circle for me.  This has been my all-time favorite film since its theatrical release back in 1976, and I urge everyone to pay their respects and buy this DVD, or get the remastered Blu-ray for better quality.  You'll be glad you did and find yourself saying what Juanita Juanita said: ""It's just so BIG!""",1028160000,29,2191,4.321951219512195
1711866,5,B000066742,"I was delighted when I first heard THE FIRST NUDIE MUSICAL was being done on a DVD.  I had a 3rd-rate VHS of the movie and eagerly awaited the DVD.  I was not disappointed.  This is a very funny movie with some of the best showtunes heard since the great shows of the 1940's and '50's.
It is amazing that this movie could be made for $150,000!  It looks as good as most million dollar productions of the time.
Unless you are offended by nudity (the movie lives up to its title), I think you will be laughing and humming along from beginning to end.
The DVD is LOADED with extras!  Two commentary tracks, a behind the scenes featurette, two deleted scenes (one a mucical number of a song Barbra Streisand should record), and more.
As an added bonus the DVD comes with a Soundtrack CD that has the music from the movie PLUS instrumental versions of the songs.  This is an extraordinary bonus!
THE FIRST NUDIE MUSICAL is a cult favorite that deserves a wider audience.  Add it to your collection.  You'll be glad you did!",1025395200,18,1018,4.406417112299465

I expected the film to be funny and the music to be imaginative, but neither really made the grade.  It's not nearly as funny as it could be, and if the DVD ever makes it to a 2nd pressing, you won't be missing much if you don't get the soundtrack.
