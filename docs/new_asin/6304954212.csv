7880502,5,6304954212,This is the third Zatoichi film I have ordered and its as good as the others I own. These are great movies. If you like Japanese culture ansd the martial arts you will love this film. It has some great swordsmanship and excellent story and acting. Try it you won't be dissappointed. Zatoichi is a great character and hard not to like. Wow! and the fight choreography with that sword. These are unique films and well worth the price.,1003708800,,432,4.481012658227848
