7031823,1,B00UA86GNM,"A large group of people were killed one night in 2011 in a home on Gabriel Street, L.A. from radiation poisoning according to the press release. Brittney (Brittney Daylee) had a brother who died there and wants to do her own investigating. Two friends accompany her to California. They are further aided by the neighbors, one which has almost an Olympian smirk, perhaps the best scene of the film.

Most of the film is found footage, while some is not. The most important end scenes are all bad found footage. As you can guess from the title, it wasn't radiation. The acting, was for the most part, bad as was the filming and the sluggish plot and dialogue. In the beginning it said 42 people were killed, later we read it is 43 . Clue or goof? The area is improperly posted for underground radiation. Clue or goof? Okay they were goofs. Certainly if you are entering an area with reported deadly radiation, you might take a detection device.

7031828,1,B00UA86GNM,"Well, I made it as far as the 37 minute mark. Just horrendous acting by the entire cast. If any of the people in this movie paid for acting lessons, I hope they went back for their change. The story can make for a decent FF flick if placed in the hand of a competent Director with a few decent actors.",1489708800,2,301,3.9508196721311477
7031829,1,B00UA86GNM,This movie reminds me of a failed college attempt at making a horror movie. It felt more like it was trying to make fun of the occult. It was just horrible.,1489363200,,156,4.064516129032258

7031833,1,B00UA86GNM,"Rating is based on the following:
There was way too much screaming and fighting amongst the main characters.  Having so much of it in one movie is obnoxious and annoying to viewers.
The storyline wasn't bad as far as wanting to know what happened to so many people, but radiation was, IMO, not the best option...Just not logical.  Different angles weren't followed up on; i.e., the girl with marks on her back was not addressed or confronted.
The ending was just the worst.  It appears the writers became lazy and tapped out saying 'done' then ended it where there should have been some better closure for the story.  Due to the ending, I was left wondering what was this supposed to be about (?).
Glad I didn't pay to watch this and I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they wish to waste a couple hours of their time.  Not thrilling, entertaining, nor scary.",1488499200,3,861,4.601307189542483

We skipped through half of the movie for self-preservation and still knew what was going on.",1515715200,,393,4.549295774647887
8704935,1,B00UA86GNM,"Amazon wouldn't allow my review the first time, despite it breaking no review guidelines. Unless saying you don't like a movie it a violation somehow? SO I'm trying again.

This is a really bad movie. The acting is below sub par. The actors sound like they don't even care to attempt being believable. They have no emotion in their voices for 90% of the film. I watched this because it's free with prime and it being around Halloween I always like watching scary stuff. By the end of the film I felt like I just spent 70 minutes staring at a wall while semi spooky music played in the background. What I mean by this is, it was entirely uneventful.

 Lastly, the plot and story telling is extremely lack luster. For some reason the two male main characters are suddenly best friends with this stranger, the girl living next door to where the deaths occurred. They are so trusting of her that they ignore the oddity of this strange girl insisting they not call for any kind of medical aid for her clearly extremely ill roommate. They also ignore their best friends concerns, the female main character, whom they have supposedly known for years, in favor of this strange girl they just met who has been nothing but sketchy from the start. This makes no sense. I could ignore a few plot holes but this movie doesn't even redeem itself by being action packed and interesting, or by having lots of good jump scares. This isn't even a case of so bad it's good. It's just a bad movie.

So if you're down for 70 minutes of almost nothing happening, far fetched story line, and awful acting, feel free to watch this.",1509148800,,1607,4.493150684931507
