4685030,5,B005FRACYM,"finally survivor thailand and amazon are being released....the bad news is...its an on demand product again...which means it will come with discs that are most likely to skip...and individual dvd cases which sucks for survivor fans because it simply does not fit well with past seasons cases (borneo, australia, all stars etc). i had to send my survivor africa, marquesas and heroes vs villains back to amazon due to scratched discs...i kept the discs that did work and put the new ones that i was unsure about back into the to copy that was being returned. so anyone about to by a dvd on demand product(one that has a dvd-r note), be aware tht you are most likely going to have to return it and replace it with a new one. i would also like to ask anyone who orders survivor thailand and survivor amazon to write a review telling if their dvd's scratched and what type of cases does this come in. And yes i do understand that manufacturing items on demand when ordered is cheaper for the company...but it seems amazon.com needs to figure out a way to do this without having poor quality discs. although it is a hastle to have to return items that are manufactured on demand due and to make sure the new discs work...it is definetly worth it having these survivor dvd's. so please amazon and cbs or whoever, kick your butts into gear and start releasing more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1312675200,25,1373,4.608163265306122

4685063,5,B005FRACYM,"Thank the reality show gods for this season. I do believe that, if it hadn't been for this season of Survivor, the show might have gone under. After season 3, came two of the most disappointing seasons of Survivor ever (the reasons why are for another review). Season six: The Amazon featured a new twist on the game that made things interesting, and not to mention it had a great cast. The twist in this game was boys vs.girls, which for the first time, addressed sexism in a reality tv show. Would the men prevail or the women? The Amazon features a few firsts in Survivor: first battle of the sexes, first fish attack, and the first handicapped person to ever play. The Amazon, in my opinion, saved the show from the disaster that was season 5 and propelled the show back into fame.",1407801600,5,785,4.458333333333333

No glitches in audio or video.  The picture quality is as good as one could expect from an SD source shown on an HDTV.

My only reservation is that the audio isn't 5.1, but that's a minor complaint for one of the best seasons of the show.

4685084,4,B005FRACYM,"Again, as with season 5, the set came with it's own box to keep the seasons separated.  Very handy.  The set was crystal clear to be able to see all of the wildlife in the Amazon.  Very cool.",1369353600,,191,3.973684210526316
4685085,5,B005FRACYM,"Rob Cesternino comes out of nowhere the second half of the season and dominates the game. His witty antics earned him the title of smartest player never to win the game by Jeff Probst. There are 2 really stuck up girls in Jenna and Heidi and they think there at a disadvantage because of how pretty they are. Rob eventually puts them in their place, but Jenna has the last laugh. Rob makes an alliance with Matthew because he's afraid he will go psycho and kill everyone in the tribe. I thought Matthew was normal but the edit really played up his craziness of sharpening a machete and everyone commenting on how creepy he is. Rob also makes an alliance with a deaf girl and because of her indecisiveness Rob has to let her go. This season started off as men vs. women and the men struggle at first but eventually level the playing field. This season gives you someone to root for and gives you a force to be reckon with in Rob. Alex makes a mistake by telling Rob the truth and for that reason he's got to go. Rob Cesternino is a legend in survivor and this season displays why.",1364860800,2,1079,4.320197044334975
4685086,4,B005FRACYM,"A good season of Survivor.

I put 4 stars instead of 5 not for the season by itself but because of the picture/resolution quality.

Poor DVD quality, 4/3 resolution. Does not really fit  a 201x 16/9 - 42"" screen.
This was very good in 2003 but now, in 2013, the TV screens have evolved to bigger sizes and resolution (Plasma, LCD, etc.) and a remastering of the image wouldn't be a big luxury.

However, it is still a pleasure to try to define how the castaways will survive to their ""adventure of a lifetime"" !",1363564800,,511,4.347368421052631

4685090,5,B005FRACYM,"I finally got around to watching season 6, and it reminded me of what made this series so remarkable.

This was hard core survivor.  Today's episodes are much less severe. The contestants were divided into men vs. women and sent to their camps with nothing at all. The rewards were far less generous than they are today.  They are either just individual rewards or the winners get to take at most one person.  They are not allowed to bring any food back to camp.  One quickly notices the absence of any of the usual challenges involving swimming - because of the piranhas and crocodiles!

This was a really physical and tough Survivor.

Most of the players were genuine and interesting.  They rarely played to the cameras as so many now do.  You'll find yourself cheering as the ""out-manned"" women pull it together and frequently give the arrogant guys a reality check.

Some may dissent, but I cheered the winner who came from far behind and exemplified the sole survivor ethic",1360281600,,978,4.7
4685091,3,B005FRACYM,"This DVD set was comprised of discs that felt heavier and appeared thicker than average DVD discs.  I tried to play them in two different DVD players with no success.  Ultimately, I had to use my PlayStation3 and the discs played fine.  There were no audio commentaries on any episodes, so the special features were lacking in that regard.  But, most importantly, this season features a deaf castaway/contestant who claimed to be participating in the show to increase awareness for the deaf and hard of hearing.  I'm sure she would be greatly disappointed (as I was) that there are NO CLOSED CAPTIONS on these discs.  That's kind of embarassing, I would think.  Shame on CBS.",1360108800,,675,4.817391304347826

4685094,1,B005FRACYM,"My Husband is a big fan so when this season kicked out I ordered a bunch of the old seasons but they won't load in our players. One DVD player played one program but would not play the other two programs left on the disc. Another DVD player would just keep saying ""no disc"" I had a portable DVD for our sailboat and it played the second program but then stopped in the middle and would not reload.
 I was going to buy a new DVD to hopefully cure the problem but then checked here first to see if others were having the same difficulty. I guess the discs are flawed. How cruel. Now I need to see if Amazon will return my money.
Oh well...  Thank goodness we didn't open all of them.",1356998400,,681,4.074626865671642
4685095,4,B005FRACYM,"Survivor Amazon was a welcome change for the show after extremely bad seasons. Right from the start this season returns back to working out how to survive in the landscape and cope with the elements. Also each group focuses more on being united and less about who is not liked, even though those topics do come up. For the first time a game twist actually helped make the season more interesting and didn't diminish my thoughts on how good the season was.

The cast was very interesting to me, there were many great people to watch (Rob, Matt, Roger, Heidi, Jenna, Christy) and even those I hated, I didn't hate with nearly as much passion as I did back with seasons 4 and 5. This season's merge was just as interesting as the pre merge as many personalities frequently kept me hooked. The final results were satisfying and although I think the final two was comprised of random people, we got good air time with them and the winner did have to work to earn his/her spot in the top two.

I do feel the most deserving person to win came up short (And I do like that person, dispite a couple bad decisions but it was only game moves I hated. Personality weise I loved this person).

A good season to redeem the show and a worthy edition to have on my shelf.",1352073600,,1255,4.354700854700854

4685097,3,B005FRACYM,"I bought this based on the reviews. I was worried about the DVD not playing in my computer, but it played fine in a 2011 Low end Gateway pc using the cybelink dvd player they include.

The dvd's did come all loose in the case. Compared to most any other DVD box set I have bought this packaging seemed very inferior.  I wondered if any of the DVD's had become scratched and unplayable but they all workd.

Two of the DVD's had sound issues were the episode being played was at a much lower volume than the other. I would turn the volume up on it and play the next episode only to get almost blasted out of my chair by the loud volume increase. Sort of unsettling. And again made me think poor production values being put into it.

I found the episode that looks back on previous episodes just sort of useless and irritating. Just include it in the regular episode please. Poor production values. I assumed this is probably because this season of survivor came out before DVD production was in full swing and it was too expensive to edit new episodes. I'd suggest they send that work to china or to college students who want experience in the industry.

The special extras were just interviews of the cast. Nothing that interesting. There were no real extras on this DVD just the show. That's ok. But I like watching Ponderosas, Dalton Ross, and Rob Cesterino work around the existing seasons. Huge survivor fan and expanding the show is always interesting to me. Again that seems to be poor production values and the Survivor producers much more concerned about their bottom line than delivering the franchise to their fans. Future DVD collections should include the ponderosas, extended reunion that wasn't seen on  tv, good edits that were cut out for time. (included in the episode, not as an extra) And commentary and interviews by Ross and Cesterino.

Some nudity in this episode. They should have just had an adult version and charged $20 extra and split the money with heidi and jenna. But maybe that motivation would wreck future survivor shows.

So all in all i got to watch the season I never saw before. I was disappointed in the product Mark Burnett put out.  And isn't about time they uped the final prize to $5 million. inflation has made that original $1 million about $250,000 in current dollars.",1341014400,,2312,4.605839416058394

All of the DVDs played wonderfully, even though two of them had been knocked loose during shipping. I loved that they included the extended exit interviews and the CBS Early Morning segments. I will definately be purchasing other seasons from Amazon. At least they are willing to create/sell more seasons.

I have other Amazon series also and not one of them has had a problem. Just check the data plate under your DVD for multi region indication or ask the retailer who may help you. My retailer even hooked up a couple of different DVD players to try see if my DVD's would work. A data plate with Region 4 only would be a problem.,1339113600,,453,4.159090909090909
4685100,5,B005FRACYM,"This is definitely one of my favorite seasons of Survivor, but that alone doesn't earn it a 5-star rating from me. This is really one of the better Survivor box-sets out there. First, it is in a single, regular-sized DVD case and is on a very reasonable 5 discs. This is a huge step up from the Africa, Marquesas, and Heroes vs. Villains releases, which were each on 9-10 discs and had three regular sized cases without a box holding them together. This is very clunky both for carrying and display. The episodes are perfectly preserved in their original airing format, so people that are complaining about nudity being blurred need to realize that this is supposed to be a remotely family-oriented show. It airs with a TV-PG rating, so there is only so much that they can get away with. Even some language that other shows get away with is censored. The bonus content is fairly substantial for a season that is almost 10 years old now. It has all of the complete exit interviews and Morning Show interviews, plus several featurettes. People who are complaining about these being manufactured on On Demand discs need to get over themselves. The quality really doesn't suffer and honestly it probably makes the product cheaper in price.",1332028800,6,1235,4.748837209302326

So glad that this is finally on DVD! The quality is great and the box that it comes in is better than seasons 3 and 4. Thanks for releasing this finally.",1327363200,,362,4.323529411764706

4685106,5,B005FRACYM,Im a die-hard Survivor fan so when I got this along with Survivor Thailand I was very happy. Full of Extras you get the complete season including the reunion. This was the season Jenna and Heidi stripped for chocolate and peanut butter,1325548800,,235,4.619047619047619
4685107,4,B005FRACYM,"Same as for my Survivor V rating, this would have 5 star rating except for the fact that each disk had at least one glitch where it stopped and then restarted (very quickly). Other than that, picture and sound quality were great. Played on a Sony blu-ray to a 50"" Sony rear projection TV.  Hope Amazon comes out with more seasons to buy.",1325376000,,337,4.349206349206349
4685108,5,B005FRACYM,"A product you literally can not find of this quality anywhere else with some extra features and decent packaging.  Create Space has really stepped up and made the best of their company's skills and time with these.  Extended exit interviews, Early Show interviews, aerial footage, Meet The Cast...there are some nice little bonus videos that are worth checking out as a fan and FINALLY, with this season we complete seasons 1 - 10 now.  After all these years.  Now maybe we can build further or start to add around the previously released Heroes VS Villains?",1325116800,,558,4.842105263157895
4685109,1,B005FRACYM,"Ah bummer, I have only seen the past couple of survivor shows, now want to buy all first 20 Seasons and watch them like they are new as I have no idea who won any of them, but I see the producers made the unbelievable mistake of highlighting the winner of each season on each box buy putting their picture in the first row in the middle, i assume...

how dumb can you get..darnit, i really wanted to watch these but why would i now...",1324944000,2,434,4.105882352941176
4685110,1,B005FRACYM,"When this product arrived, the contents were rattling around so bad that I had to open it up to see if it was broken (it was a gift for somebody else).  The 5 disks inside were all lose.  This is the worst CD case I have ever come across.  None of the disks were broken, but the jury is still out on whether they will play properly.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  The other Survivor I purchased (Vanuatu), is in a different case that doesn't allow this to happen.  I had already read a similar review regarding this issue here on Amazon, so I was forewarned.  Can't see how this product could be shipped without the disks coming lose while in transit.  Not the shippers fault - its the manufacturer.",1324512000,,698,4.3565891472868215
4685111,2,B005FRACYM,"Its a good dvd but I returned first set because it was defective ,on some disc there were no voices ! I rec. a second set and on same disc I had the same problem no voices again ! So I desided to keep it for a month then order a new one and return the old one hopefully they fix the problem by then !

4685112,1,B005FRACYM,"If I wanted DVD-Rs, I'd be burning them myself. Do it right please and just release them. And if they're not getting enough sales to justify releasing the seasons on permanent DVDs, maybe they should try releasing unrated versions.  I enjoy the show, but if I actually buy it instead of watching it under outdated prudish US censorship rules, I think they shouldn't be blurring nudity or bleeping words. So far, the only season I've actually seen nudity or heard expletives in was the first. And in that case it would have been better to blur (Richard Hatch). I'll bet sales would soar on this season and the one with Jeff Probst's former girlfriend Julie if the seasons were uncensored!  But please, release all of the seasons with regular DVDs instead of these on-demand DVD-Rs which so many people are stating are poor quality!",1323216000,3,830,4.756944444444445

4685115,5,B005FRACYM,"One of the Best seasons ever.  This is the last season where the survivors had  little food rewards, and only a couple of times did they get to bring a friend.  All were in bad health at the end of the show.  And they all lost a lot of weight.  In fact Butch lost 38 pounds, Matt and Rob lost 30.  Just watch them all suffer.",1322611200,,325,3.8484848484848486

4685117,5,B005FRACYM,"This was such an exciting season of Survivor.  With the addition of Rob Cesternino to the Survivor world, the game changed.  He was the first player in the history of the show to prove that switching alliances at the right time can keep you in the game longer.  This season was also one of the original strategic seasons.  After Survivor 8, a new school type game was brought to the table which, in my opinion, isn't as great as the older seasons.  This would probably be in the Survivor top ten seasons and I really recommend it.  And both Rob Cesternino and Jenna Morasca have made careers out of this show.  Keep up with Rob's really entertaining Survivor (and more) podcasts at Robhasawebsite.com

4685119,5,B005FRACYM,This season gave Survivor a big leap in viewers it is by far the best season along with Heroes vs Villains and All Stars. I think right when it gets out of pre-order hundreds of people are going to buy this because it had the best cast a girl who was deaf and had awesome challenges. If you buy this your money will be well spent and you WILL enjoy watching this season over and over again. Even though its not in a box set it will still be one of the best seasons you will ever own of Survivor. If you don't buy this you will regret it. So hurry up Amazon and put it out of Pre-Order and let's get our Survivor Party on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1314748800,,655,4.165354330708661
4685120,5,B005FRACYM,"Survivor is probably my favorite show on tv.  I'm glad they are going back and getting these sets out.  Most of the complaints about these sets being released is that they don't come in a box to hold all the DVD cases.  It's not really a big deal for me, since it seems to take up the same amount of space on the shelf.

Also, as far as bad discs are concerned, I've bought Africa, Marquesas, and Heroes Vs. Villains, and have had no problems playing any of the discs.  Also the quality of the video is excellent.",1314403200,6,513,4.1938775510204085
