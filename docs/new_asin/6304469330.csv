8080002,5,6304469330,"The video provides an insight look into ""Who is Collin"" Statements by his friends and coworkers spell out what  his fans feel when listening to his music. Not just am I new  to country music I have never  owned more than one at the most two recordings of any artist. I took  Amazons suggestion and bought Tracks approx. 5 weeks ago, I own six of his  CD's  now, and like each and every song on each of them. Viewing the video  just confirmed that he is the greatest. He is true to his music, and to his  believes which makes him even more likable. The only negative about the  video, it wasn't long enough. I believe anyone viewing the video will enjoy  it, and probably buy another one by this great artist. The video also  convinced me to go see him in concert in a few weeks, the clip shown how he  performs life influenced my decision. Keep up the great job Collin.",964656000,10,869,4.263803680981595
