""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."" we replied. ""Ooooo Kaaaaay."" After a brief description (he was being paid by the hour) he went back to work. I doubt he'll seek it out, however.
Tim Roth, Gary Oldman, and Richard Dreyfuss all were in command of their very wordy characters. The two, obscure main characters from Hamlet, adrift in a complex plot with no backstory, never did quite latch on to which was Rosencranz and who was Guildenstern. This produced a fair amount of comedy. An enjoyable film, but if the plotline of Hamlet is foggy, read/watch/CliffNotes it before watching this.

But the fact that everyone already knows how it goes, except for Rosencratz and Guildenstern, makes for this spellbinding and elastic tension that draws us through the film. The action conjures up feelings like that of watching a spinning top: it is highly playful, curious, and inventive. Gary Oldman and Tim Roth play their roles with such natural ease, they make this quirky film into a personal favorite.

594022,2,6303191398,"What are the minor characters in Shakespeares Hamlet doing when they are not actively engaged in carrying the plot forward? Answer: nothing.
The question makes as much sense as asking what Guildensterns father did for a living. Answer: nothing, he never existed.  OK, thats way too rationalist to approach a deliberately absurdist production like this.  But if they did somehow have an independent existence I hope they would be a lot more interesting than portrayed here.  For example, the titular two don't remember anything about their past before they were summoned by the king.  Well, of course not, Shakespeare didn't provide any prior existence for them so there is nothing for them to remember.  This you will notice loops back to the first point.

594106,5,6303191398,"This is my favorite movie.  I like Shakespeare and appreciate Hamlet.  There is just something about the surrealistic tale that Tom Stoppard weaves in this movie that captures my imagination.  I first watched it in college.  It was recommended by my favorite professor. I didn't like it that much.  Due to the admiration of my professor, I read Hamlet, watched the Mel Gibson and Sir Laurence Olivet versions of Hamlet and watched it again.  I was mildly impressed.  In successive viewings I have come to treasure the simple, subtle complexity of Stoppard's weaving of his remarkably plausible backstory with the actual text of Shakespeare's play. It is far more than I would have guessed as a boy of 21.  It gets better with successive viewings and years of life.  I have watched it intermittently for over twenty years.  Some of the silly lines, that aren't inherently humorous on the surface, are among my favorite jokes of all time.

Gary Oldman and Tim Roth are perfect as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Hamlet who question the nature of reality, leading Stoppard to imagine them as two souls who can't remember exactly who they are and who can't see the obvious in front of their eyes.  As Tim Roth observes, ""there are alternatives but not choice"".  Even with the excellent performances of Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, Richard Dreyfus steals the show as the player.  Donald Sumpter, Joanna Miles, Ian Richardson give strong performances in their roles.  I initially hated Iain Glen's performance as Hamlet.  I still see it as a weak point in the film but have come to appreciate it.

Among the strengths of the play and film is that the commentary of the Player applies to Shakespeare in general as well as the play that all the characters are trapped in.  The humor and word play Stoppard writes mirrors the humorous elements of Shakespeare's writing that are often lost in the archaic language of the time.  Gary Oldman also delivers a variation on Hamlets famous ""to be or, not to be"" speech that is profound and haunting.  This speech is one of the best I have ever heard or read.

I consider the Hangover one of the funniest comedies ever.  This comedy is the opposite.  The Hangover overwhelms with sheer crude audacity, but very good writing.  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead weaves a subtle joke with remarkable wisdom that doesn't jump out and knock the viewer over.  It is an elegant film that becomes increasingly humorous and satisfying over years.  Like wine it is an acquired taste with complex flavors.  An appreciation for Shakespeare and theatre is helpful.  This is not a film for everyone.  It is a precious gift for some.  I am grateful that the admiration of my favorite professor was enough for me to consider it beyond my first viewing.",1427846400,13,2792,4.804621848739496

Shakespeare or Hamlet have never been my favorites but these two extraordinary fellows, Rosencrantz and Guildernstern, have guided me through Hamlet with a very fascinating way. The play seemed to be tricky and funny when I watched it the first time in 1991. Today, 23 years later it seems to be as tragic as comic. A tale about two characters who travel on the mysterious  pathway ignoring the omens and skipping the crossroads. So, they meet their fate inevitably in the end.

It's partly the beginning, which is a little slow, and partly my general prejudice that plays don't translate well to film.

My Mistake. This lavishly filmed production is everything the play can be and more. The cast is stunning., Tim Roth and Gary Oldman might have been born to play R&G (or is it G&R?), Richard Dryfuss nails his performance as the head of the actors, and Iain Glen made one of the clearest, most sympathetic Hamlets I've seen, making me long to click through and watch that play as well.",1408320000,,747,4.374100719424461

It always will because Shakespeare did not write that they found a coin, flipped it and landed on either heads or tails!  The characters bumble through the movie not having much of any idea as to what is going on until they recite their lines from the play itself.  You will also love Richard Dreyfuss' character as the leader of the theatrical troupe who, since his character has been in the play itself, knows the sequence of events and hints of them to Rosencantz and Guildenstern without actually telling them anything.

594358,5,6303191398,"Watching this movie without being familiar with the characters and story of Shakespeare's play, ""Hamlet"" is like watching a ballet without having a clue as to the story. It is not impossible to enjoy without knowing ""Hamlet"", but it makes the experience ever so much better. Note that some productions of ""Hamlet"" give the Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern subplot little attention, and may even cut it out entirely. See Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" to get the full picture (it's a darn good rendition of the play as well.)

The biggest single plus for the film is that it does not only tell the backstory of two minor characters in ""Hamlet"", played marvelously played by Gary Oldman as Rosenkrantz and Tim Roth as Guildenstern. It also tells a lot about the backstory of the troupe of traveling ""tragedians"", the company commissioned to put on the play which Hamlet hopes will wake the conscience of the king. This supplies the third lead character, ""The Lead Player"" played by Richard Dreyfuss.

When either Dreyfuss or other Hamlet scenes are on the screen, everything seems about right. There are even some of Hamlet's more famous scenes played out, with Shakespeare's words. But when the two title characters are along, a sense of deep unreality sets in. For example, at the very beginning of the film, there is a conceit where Rosenkrantz finds a coin in the road and starts flipping it over and over, and it continually comes up heads. Guildenstern bets against that several times, and loses every time, until they reach a count of over 100 heads. Something about their world has become unstuck. It is to this play what the appearance of the specter is in ""Hamlet"". Something is not right in their world. It's the kind of unreality we sense in Peter Greenaway's films, especially because the visual plays such an important part. Contrary to Roger Ebert, there are visual clues which would be missed on the stage.

Over half of the movie rests on the shoulders of the name leads, and for an audience who is used to seeing Oldman as the perfect villain or Tim Roth as the small time robber ""Pumpkin"" in ""Pulp Fiction"", these roles really show a new side of their talent. Roth has the same English accent as ""Pumpkin"", but Oldman is in an entirely new place. I could hardly take my eyes off him. They are innocents in a chaotic world which is destined to crumble around them.

Since so much depends on the dialogue between the two, some professional reviewers have said the play was unsuitable for the screen. I would counter that what the camera gives us is close-ups of the faces, especially of Oldman and Roth, and captures the most subtle expressions, which would have been missed from the mezzanine of a large theatre.

Let's be fair. This movie asks a lot of its viewers, in addition to the need to see Hamlet. It is not for everyone. But, for those who really like subtlety and a unique kind of mystery, this is for you.",1373241600,3,2924,4.692007797270955

Anyhow, my daughter an actor in her own write badgered me into watching this, saying I was more a visualist when it came to drama with words of more than two syllables. What the hell are they when theys at home then? Over rated tricks of the writer's profession me thinks. I didn't get to where I am today by having bag loads of syllables. Anyway Mr Oldham and Mr Roth aka Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are neatly dovetailed into a long scene of Shakespearean clown/comic as ever had the misfortune to slip on pencil grease on any stage anywhere. But let me tell you, Stoppard didn't wrote this play-Shakespeare did who recently turned four hundred and something and lives in Milton Keynes with wife twenty eight known as Lady Southampton. Stoppard, when he's not busy pretending to land on the moon is just a brand name for some flimsy bits of theatre and screenplays. Everyone knows Lord Olivier directed Shakespeared in Love. So, because this was written by Shakespeare, directed by Shakespeare and like Lear he appears in a small bit part as a babe in arms then this is side smackingly brilliant film. If you haven't watched it, do so. If you don't like it blame me. My name is Som Toppard esq once of Newcastle upon Tynemouth, now in occupation residing on my bum in terrius nullius (Nicole Kidman's backyard).",1346198400,,1470,4.530075187969925
594519,3,6303191398,"Two Elizabethan gentlemen find themselves summoned to Elsinore by Claudius to attend their friend Hamlet, who is transformed and neither his exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was. However, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern perceive that perhaps all is not what it seems. The laws of physics, probability and time have been suspended...

Well - I tried very hard with this. It seems to me that this one of those plays that one is expected to see before you die and as I'm unlikely to see it at the theatre in the near future (not because of an impending early demise, I hope), Stoppard's film adaptation of his own play ought to be the next best thing. Never having seen it on stage (nor indeed have I seen any Shakespeare) perhaps puts me at a disadvantage...

If I'm honest it WAS a struggle, but I think that you can enjoy this on several levels.

First of course is the story itself, which is dense and fast moving (or at least the dialogue certainly is, and sub-titles helped immeasurably here). As far as I can tell, Stoppard is exploring a rather convoluted and existential concept, akin to Magritte's ""Ceci n'est pas un pipe"". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (or is it Guildenstern and Rosencrantz?) know themselves to be ""real"" people (rather than simply actors playing those parts) but they also come to realise that they are operating within - and owe their existence to - a fiction. From their perspective then, is what is happening around them real or not? Their experiences >feel< genuine enough to them (witness Rosencrantz's near discovery of Newton's Laws, gravitation, the steam engine, powered flight and, strangely, the Big Mac) and so they are compelled to go along with events. The arrival of a band of travelling tragedians adds a new layer of (un)reality to the story: a play within a play within a play and the conundrum is compounded yet further as Lead Player takes on the task of unpicking the riddle for R & G - an exponent of fiction, peddling reality! That much is clear to me (I think, but who can really say?). Beyond that, and struggling manfully to keep up with the rapidly delivered and archaic Shakespearean dialogue, I foundered, left wondering precisely what was Stoppard trying to prove? Perhaps (no, certainly) I'm not clever enough to divine that and I do suspect that a better appreciation of the real play ""Hamlet"" might have helped me. Next stop is the script for R&C which I have on Kindle.

On an entirely different level, however, the performance is easy enough to enjoy. Roth and Oldman are, as always, excellent value and they are hugely entertaining. The glorious nuances of their expression and delivery contrast very nicely with their Laurel and Hardy-esque interpretation of the two characters. One (Oldman) innocently dim and the other (Roth) in charge but in no way in control; the sparks they strike of one another are a joy to watch. Dreyfuss hams it up (with a somewhat variable accent, bless him) as the Player and Ian Glen overacts suitably as the raving Prince of Denmark.

In the end, I didn't know quite what to make of this. I am pretty sure I missed something fundamentally important but I enjoyed in nonetheless.

Rosencrantz: (tossing a coin) Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads! Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads! Heads.
Guildenstern: Consider. One, probability is a factor which operates *within* natural forces. Two, probability is *not* operating as a factor. Three, we are now held within un-, sub- or super-natural forces. Discuss.

.
In truly one of the cleverest concepts ever, Stoppard explores the characters, idiosyncrasies and motives of two minor players from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" At times R & G participate in Will's Danish-set tragedy exactly as written, at others they step out of it and observe the cryptic goings on in Castle Elsinore, speculating on what each event means.

Most brilliant of all is a puppet show of how Prince Hamlet's mother came to marry his murdered father's brother that's watched by faceless mutes who represent the people being depicted, who are angrily observed by the actual new king and his bride, who are spied upon by R&G. This echoing mirror effect is taken in by us, five times removed from the original regicide.

It's an astounding sequence that's just one of many in a supelative period motion picture packed with sparkling dialogue. After experiencing this, you'll never see Hamlet again without connecting the two works.

594692,4,6303191398,"`Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead' is truly a film I had no expectations of walking into it.  I decided to watch it because I generally like Richard Dreyfuss, and the premise of the film sounded interesting.  That said premise was also deceiving and I found myself confused for the first twenty minutes or so.  I actually thought that this was about a group of actors who put on a stage performance of `Hamlet', I had no idea that it was `Hamlet' just told from another point of view.  After I figured that out the film become much more enjoyable for me.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two dimwitted acquaintances of Hamlet's who are contacted by his mother and step father to try and discern just what is bother Hamlet.  They are told they will be amply rewarded if they succeed and so the two of them find themselves with free reign of the castle, overhearing conversations and trying desperately to put the pieces together.  The trouble is that they can't even seem to keep their identities straight, let alone the root cause of Hamlet's distress.

We all know the story of Hamlet, tragic as it is, so the point of `Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead' is not to simply rehash Shakespeare's play but make light of it with witty dialog and sharp execution.  For the most part the film succeeds marvelously.

The casting of Gary Oldman and Tim Roth in the leads was superb.  The two of them play off one another beautifully with their banter.  If you though that the recent `Juno' was heavy handed you really need to get a load of this film, for the mere fact that Roth and Oldman are able to get through each scene without choking on their words is a marvelous feat.  They both seem so natural in their respective roles (whichever one that is) and their charisma is really what helps coast the film along.  Richard Dreyfuss is also delightful as the wise and mysterious actor who seems to grasp the goings-on's of the house a little more than Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do.  I normally am not a huge fan of Dreyfuss' comedic work, but here he is spot on.

My only complaint about the film is that at times the audience is left to feel as confused as the two leads, and really we should always be aware of what is going on, for that is what makes their confusion all the more entertaining.  I am a big fan of mystery and intrigue, but when you get to the point that you are trying so hard to figure out what just happened that you miss what happened next it can get a little tiring.

Thankfully that confusion does not permeate the entire film, and we are left with an overall satisfying comedy that attacks the funny bone with force and without mercy.  Thanks to the natural feel to the bantering, Stoppard's screenplay becomes one of the best of the year, witty, sharp and entertaining to the very end.",1219622400,,2813,4.512820512820513

I found the movie to be only somewhat amusing and very confusing.  This movie is based on a great idea:  tell the background story of two minor characters from Hamlet.  While it is filled with some great dialogue (most lifted from Hamlet) and a few great scenes (I particularly liked the one at the beginning with Richard Dreyfuss as the Player King and his troupe of slightly mad actors), it also overly complex and, for the most part, almost incomprehensible.

594765,5,6303191398,"Ah, what to say about ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" (R&GrDead)? In this classic stage-play-turned-movie, we find two characters with little background and no future in the play ""Hamlet"". They are, of course Rosencrantz and Guildenstern played by Tim Roth and Gary Oldman, respectively (or is it Gary Oldman and Tim Roth respectively? Meh, s'not important) and... well, they die.

As in all great tragedies, all the main characters suffer and then die. Hamlet is no different. The prince finds himself in a bit of a quandry as his mother has married her dead husband's brother. Hamlet becomes 2nd banana to the throne while his uncle-father proceeds with the usurping. Hamlet pretends (maybe) to be insane to preserve his own skin causing great suffering to his beloved Ophelia.  If his new king knew that Hamlet was sane, then Hamlet will soon follow the recently deceased king to the grave; more ""Not to be"" and less ""To be"".

Richard Dreyfus comes to the castle with his troupe of players to be the foil by playing a slightly altered ""Murder of Gonzago"". Having been the foil for the newly crowned king, and showing everyone how the old king was killed, we see Richard Dreyfus is also the foil for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in foreshadowing their own demise within the play, and in the movie. In one of the best scenes, we see the play, ""Hamlet"", being played for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern viewing the scene where the King views the players playing the ""Murder of Gonzago"" being played while they themselves are in the play ""Hamlet"" in the movie ""R&GrDead"".  This quadruple nesting makes the geek in me all atwitter. Throughout it all, while trying to recover their past, discovering Gravity, Inertia, Archimedes Principle and Flight, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are tasked to determine what is wrong with their childhood friend, the Prince of Denmark.

A play within a play, it is a masterful piece of work with superb, thought-provoking humor and quick dialog. If you are not familiar with the play Hamlet, I would recommend watching it BEFORE ""R&GrDead"" (Kevin Branagh's version not Mel Gibson's). While ""Hamlet"" is tense, dramatic and everything a Shakespearian tragedy should be, ""R&GrDead"" is a witty comedy placed in a tragedy.

594767,4,6303191398,"This play is a myth in Shakespearean theater, maybe even a cult. When the play came out in 1967 it was acclaimed as a postmodern rewriting of our vision of the world. A tragedy like Hamlet's is here entirely captured through the eyes of the two secondary characters in the play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Finally someone was looking at great dramatic historical events from the point of view of two insignificant witnesses, maybe even not witnesses, just people there unwilling and un-chosen, just there by accident or opportunism. They look and understand nothing. They feel something is hidden from them but they do not know what. They capture glimpses and tidbits here and there from behind a window or through a closed door and the plot is slowly reconstructed out of shape from a completely deconstructed partial vision. They even think they are taking advantage of the situation to their own profit and they end up hanged. That was received by many in America as a metaphor of the Vietnam war, a war decided and managed by the leaders of the world but fought and suffered by the simple draftees. It was an immediate success on American campuses. But today, and even maybe in 1990 when the film was made, the meaning is no longer that simple, that postmodern. It is not a metaphor of the war on Iraq. It is not in anyway an anti-war pamphlet as it once was. It is not even an anti-establishment pamphlet because the war on Iraq is fought by professionals and not draftees, because there is no alternative ideology or even utopia questioning the apparent full domination of global market economy and unclear not always very decisive elections between Tweedledee or Tweedledum or maybe Tweedledum and Tweedledee. And as a matter of fact it is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that look like these politicians who are wavering from one side to the other, from one pit to the next, from one illumination to a vision, and never coming to any kind of control over things except by tossing a coin. We are getting into a new post-postmodern period where there still is no truth, where there are still only points of view, but we now know history is not done by individuals, groups or even masses. History is beyond our grasp and understanding. We just struggle to survive, no matter what. The tragedy is then no longer for the leaders of the world, the drama for the copycat actors and the melodrama for the masses. We are just pawns on a chessboard that no one controls. So the film has aged, and the play has aged. Neither speak to us as they used to howl to our thirst and hunger for freedom.

It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative & inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about.

Fortunately, Ros & Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets.

The chemistry between Roth & Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, & Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.)

The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :)

If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun :)",1148515200,3,1502,4.447272727272727
594894,4,6303191398,"This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone.

This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince.

In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps.

It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style.

It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier.

It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn.

It's is fun.",1143676800,8,1355,4.6722689075630255

Watching the first fifteen minutes of ""heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,"" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen.

There is a lot of bawdy (sexual) humor in the movie as well as the play, but that just makes it all the funnier.  The presence of Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss doesn't hurt either.

The movie is generally true to the play script (available from Amazon), with some minor modifications.  But they do not change the nature of the play.  The essence, from the symbolic pages (of a script?) flying in the wind near the beginning to the near-inventions of various machines throughout, to the word play with the traveling acting troupe's leader at the outset, is preserved.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is almost an anti-Hamlet, although it does contain some of Shakespeares script unchanged (His scenes with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in them are included in the play and video.)

Since Hamlet is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays I thought Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead would be a pretty interesting play to read. I was wrong. It was wonderful.

And when I heard that Stoppard directed a film version, I had to watch it. I waited for months until it was on tv and I've been obsessed ever since. Oldman is a genius and he plays Rosencrantz as if he was born to play the part. Roth is great as the dominant, ever analyzing partner and Dreyfuss is brilliant as the Player who actually seems to be the only one in the whole thing that knows what's happening.

If you've read the play, go watch this! It will make the play make even more sense (if that's possible due to the general confusion that exists) and if you've seen the movie go read the play because some of the best conversations between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been left out.",1126396800,3,1138,4.546341463414634

However, the DVD I received from Image Entertainment is perfectly fine. I didn't encounter any of the defects described earlier. The picture quality is not perfect but taking into account it's low budget origin, it's quite acceptable. There are very occasional dust specks, some film nicks and a missing/skipped frame or two (I paused and rewound that segment several times to be sure). There is fine grain throughout, although it's hardly distracting. The one major fault is that black levels bottom out to a dark grey so that the transfer loses out on a sense of depth. Otherwise colors are accurately rendered. As far as I can tell, it looks like the original 1.85:1 widescreen (anamorphic). It didn't look mis-composed to me and I do look out for such stuff. I thought the DTS soundtrack was a bit of an overkill but I'm not complaining. Both the DTS and the Dolby 5.1 sound pretty good with the DTS having the edge. Unfortunately, no subtitles for those unable to get round the British accents. If you do get a faulty DVD it's probably just a problem with that single copy. I'd exchange it or get a refund.

If you're a fan, there's a whole 3 plus hours of interviews, 1 hour each with Tom Stoppard and Gary Oldman, 45 mins with Richard Dreyfuss and half an hour with Tim Roth.

First thing that hits you is that the menus are screwed.  Highlighting doesn't appear where it should, making it difficult - if not impossible - to tell which option you have selected.

When you get the movie playing, the compression has MAJOR PROBLEMS.  My DVD player is only 2 years old, but there isn't a 10-second section of the entire movie that doesn't have several seconds at a time of completely garbled video - characters appearing and disappearing at random, multiple instances of a single character on screen at a time, the works.

To top it off, the whole this is a rip-off job.  They obviously took a pan-and-scan of the movie and slapped black bars on it.  This is made very clear in a number of scenes where you get pan-and-scan jumping as characters move around.

I would have thought that after the MGM lawsuit (they lost) that this sort of thing would have ended.  I guess where there's a customer to be ripped off there's a corporation more than happy to do it.

I recommended it to a friend who works at Renaissance fairs throughout the year. He watched it over and over again to get the accent down and then used some of the lines at fair. He also mastered the game Questions featured in the movie which is a great way to break the ice with customers.

Stoppard's use of language is incredible, and if you don't find this movie incredibly funny, as some reviewers have said, then I think you should probably stick to Hollywood schlock. This film is hilarious beginning to end, from the coin flips to the...end...

It's a brilliant look at Hamlet as one of the first plays to exhibit modern themes: fate, the inability to act, the dichtomy between thought and action, free will, existentialism. Hamlet was a play years ahead of its time, which is why Stoppard is able to blend the themes of Hamlet and Godot into such a seamless (and hilarious) whole.

All of the actors in this film are brilliant. Roth and Oldman are at their best. Richard Dreyfuss is absolutely priceless.

It doesn't suprise me that a lot of modern movie viewers don't have the patience or mental capacity to enjoy a film as complex as this, but for any thinking, intelligent person, this is one of the greats.

Take two minor characters from Hamlet, and give them the existential philosophical foundation of Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"" - and you have a masterpiece.  The allusions, the ironies, the cultural references, the wordplay... brilliant.  It all seems so very absurd - these two characters who don't know who or why they're really here - but we feel for them, because we see a hint of the universal human condition in them.

No matter what they do, the viewer KNOWS how Shakespeare's play unfolds, so we know their fate is sealed.  They're destined to die very soon, and all they can do is try to make some sense of their existence before it happens.  That's the human condition.  That's us, even if we don't want to admit it.

The melancholy of Hamlet, the bleakness of Godot, and yet the play is still funny as hell!  Stoppard's film does a wonderful job of using visual metaphor to accent the themes of his play, while still keeping the pace fast and the superb humor at the forefront.

Please give the film a try.  If you like challenging, thought-provoking movies that still have you laughing... you'll dig this!",1108598400,49,1245,4.665137614678899

I kept watching, hoping for the laughs that undoubtedly were heard in the theater. Nothing! Nada! Zip!

Roth and Oldman, frankly, are not very good. They're both very one dimensional and start to get on your nerves which adds to the boredom. You don't care about them. Roth is impatient and sour; Oldman is dim and vacuous. Spending a whole movie with these two is punishing. Stoppard's direction is even worse. The verbal lines go quickly, but it all seems sooo slow. That's incompetent direction.

Less about Hamlet or the two minor (in the play, here major) title characters and much more of a philosophical analysis of no particualr subject, the film flows beautifully by way of our two heroes' deadpan capacity for both processing and delivering quasilogical nonsense, all severely entertaining.

With Richard Dreyfuss in a supporting role, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth playing hysterically obtuse messengers, and Tom Stoppard's intensely perverse logic/illogic, you have both brain battlers and belly laughs, sometimes in one speech or phrase.

I would not say this film is viewable as a narrative--its value proceeds from fine acting and humorous yet not frivolous dialogue.  Sets and costumes lend realism and gravity to this sideways examination of Shakespeare's most famous play.

Answer: floundering around, not entirely clear as to who they are, and absolutely clueless about what is going on.  I remember being electrified by the play's genius when I first read it six million years ago, and only stumbled on the film adaptation by chance while channel surfing in San Diego.  The film is a gem.  Gary Oldman is a treasure as Rosencrantz, a follower if ever there was one, innocently and accidentally discovering the laws of physics then shrugging them off.  Rosencrantz is a trifle slow at times, and he doesn't seem to know- or care- whether he is Rosencrantz or Guildenstern.  Mostly, he just wants to go home.  Tim Roth is brilliant as Guildenstern, who does know who he is but doesn't know what he can do about it. The interactions and wordplay between these two are dazzling.  Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the slightly sinister Player.  Dreyfuss tends to chew scenery which is entirely apt for this character.

Quoting:

""We stick to our usual stuff more or less. Only inside-out. We do on stage the things that are supposed to be off. Which is a kind of integrity is you look upon every exit being an entrance somewhere else.""

Partially because of both Oldman and Roth delivering awesome performances as Rosencrantz and Gildenstern respectively. (Or was it the other way around?), partially because of the amazing plot, and the great humour implemented in the movie.
So, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, both minor characters in Shakespear's Hamlet now star in their very own movie. They don't know what their purpose is, or who is who exactly. All they know is they were sent for.
It turns out the king of Denmark wants them to try and find out what happened to Hamlet, who doesn't seem to quite have it all together anymore. The plot thickens as Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are being drawn into a web of treason and politics, which they themselves, of course, never see coming.
The performance by Roth and Oldman is simply stunning. Both very convincingly draw attention to each other. Oldman as the slightly more naieve one discovering all kinds of scientific wonders, only to find them unappreciated by the more clever Roth, or being denied international scientific recognition by nature itself. (Some of these scenes are just hilarious, and those alone are worth buying the DVD).
The dialogue in the movie is truly amazing, although at times tough to understand (cause of the old English), so I'm kinda hoping the DVD will sport subtitles.
This is one of the two movies my collection has been patiently waiting for for a few years (Swing Kids being the other one). A definite 5 out of 5.",1023926400,80,1686,4.757679180887372

Roth and Oldman have an incredible chemistry and create the most realistic friendship I've seen in quite some time. Stoppard's writing is amazingly funny and also steeped deeply in Shakespearian knowledge.

Of course, if you have never seen Hamlet or you don't know a lot about Shakespeare, this film also works on completely different levels, no less funny or entertaining. Rozencrantz & Guildenstern have their own story here, and it is told with incredible wit and preciseness. The game of questions and the continual destuction of all of Oldman's discoveries/inventions are alone worth seeing the movie for, but there is so much more here that will entertain ALL types of viewers (from the Shakespearians on down to the ShakeWHO?ians).

To see some of the exhorbitant prices that people are fetching for used copies of the VHS here and on ebay I should think it would raise the flag that there is an audience for this...
Tim Roth and Gary Oldman are brilliant and play off each other as if they had been friends for a millenium. The game of Questions they play is unforgettable.
Watching Oldman wander around inadvertantly inventing and discovering things while Roth routinely destroys them is hilarious.
Still not quite sure which one was which but no matter..

595223,5,6303191398,"It is a shame when this film can't even manage a DVD release even with the potential commercial profitability of Stoppard's name after his lamer inside joke, ""Shakespeare in Love"" won best picture.  There is no sense to the universe, I guess.
A brilliant spoof on Hamlet which manages a shockingly comparable level of depth to the masterpeice it takes place within, when it comes to dealing with certain ""existential"" motifs.  Of course, the vast range of insight and interest of Hamlet is not paralleled here.  Nonetheless, this is a sublime meditation on the life and death of the peripheral characters of life, who are written in to the story solely to die, whose fate does not make sense to them as a series of interconnected meaningful events as it does for great men like Hamlet, but rather whose fate is as pointless and as uncomprehended as their sudden awakening to find themselves thrown into a situation they couldn't account for to begin with.  The film is about waking up one day and finding yourself just being-there, not knowing how you got there or why or even what your own name is for sure.  It is about wandering around as greatly important things are going on and just not understanding them or even what they have to do with your life.
It is the tragedy of existentialism, not the great faults of the great men leading to ruin as in the tragedy of classicism, but instead the sudden insurgence of immanent ruin without a clear explanation of why or even of what the life that is ending was about---what purposes started it, defined it, propelled it, and then wanted it dead.  It is the characters invented by accident as part of some plot device to which they are just a means, becoming self aware and asking what they are doing there, where they came from and then suddenly why they have to die.  Like the creatures of a blind chance and unexplained purposes suddenly developing a sense of that they should have meaning, that where they're going should make sense, only to die without anything being explained to them.  Whether one embraces existentialism as articulate and practically systematic philosophy or in some degree of feeling of existential tragedy and responsibility, the experience of it in this film is well worth the having.
These brilliant ideas that I can only stumble around trying to articulate in words here are so perfectly portrayed through both the script and through what Leonard Maltin above calls the film's ""lifelessness.""  I disagree with Maltin that this element proves the film should have been left on the stage.  This is a film that is ABOUT a sense of emptiness, it is the tone and the theme driving all the witty movement of the dialogue and the plot.  Plus Stoppard's use of visual symbolism and a handful of great sight gags justify this film version of his momentous play.
AND last but not least, could there be a finer treat than the chance to see Tim Roth, Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfus as the actors to immortalize it?",998524800,4,2982,4.704414587332054
595224,5,6303191398,"The very premise of Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, namely the observation of familiar events from a great classic play (Hamlet) by insiders without understanding of what's going on, is terribly clever.  But that isn't the best part.  Tom Stoppard's dialogue is simply too clever to be believed.  Even after watching this tape several times, I find myself rewinding in spots to pick up a line or two that slipped by so fast that it only caught my ear.  I still find it hard to believe that matters this philosophical and literary can be quite as funny as Stoppard makes them.  What is even harder to understand is why more of his work isn't more widely performed in films or otherwise.  Stoppard was one of the collaborating screenwriters on Shakespeare in Love and, after seeing Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, it's very easy to guess where the cleverest plot devices and most sharply funny lines come from.  Ros and Gil is a deeper and less glitzy film than Shakespeare and doesn't have the love story to unify the plot, but for that reason it is probably the more meritorious of the two films and the one that should have more long term recognition.",991353600,,1144,4.71859296482412
595322,5,6303191398,"Having been introduced to the play by a friend who performed the part of Rosencrantz, last year... I have been in love with the story ever since.  This year myself and another friend also performed the duo for an exam piece, and over the past two years I've tried to explore the characters and stories... to the aim of putting on a full scale production.
This is undoubtedly my favourite play-to-film translation... it has been tested and failed many times before, but if anyone was to make it succeed, it was to be Tom Stoppard.  The story delivers us into the world of Shakespeare's Hamlet, but unlike any other before, Stoppard focuses on the limited characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and gives them a branch of their own.  His imagination tells their story, background, and involvement in the events surrounding Hamlet transformation.
The duo have been summoned by the King of Denmark, at first unsure of his reason, they make their way into the service of the new King.  For the purpose of aiding Hamlet recovery from his apparent 'madness', they are instructed, as his old childhood friends.  On the journey they happen to meet a company of actors, under the command of 'The Player', who throughout the course of the film proceed to try and warn the naive pair of the events that will occur.  Of course they do not take the hints, and their final exit is beautiful.
With the young talents (at the time) of Tim Roth and Gary Oldman, in the title roles of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern... or is that Guildenstern and Rosencrantz... not even they know.  The two are absolutely magnificent to watch and with such an intuitive spark between them, they easily challenge any stage pair that have tackled the parts.  Guiding them is Richard Dreyfus, as 'The Player' a brilliantly supportive yet lead role, who delivers one of the best performances of his extensive career.
The film has some of the most outstanding images that I have ever witnessed, the most prominant would have to be the shots of the paper scripts floating down.  This begins as they adorn the Player's mobile-stage, with the paper bursting out from a little cupboard.  The other scenes follow, the best of which is when the two are in Hamlet's chambers, with the paper falling down around them, it's stunning.  You may ask what is the significance of the paper scripts, I don't know what Stoppard meant for them... but for myself I firmly would believe that they are the most magical element of the story.  The connection to reality, the little reminders that it's a story within a story, and in support of the Player they are trying to wake Rosencrantz and Guildenstern up and make them aware that they know the events and ultimately what will happen to them.  The other sequence that I will never forget is of the two tossing the coins.  For me it is one of the most intellectually written and performed concepts in entertainment history, each character has his own money pouch, and the beauty that their money continually travels back and forth between the two is timeless... as is their hope.  To me the coin represents the predictable course of their lives; their desire and willingness for it to be 'tails', shows a want for something unpreditable to twist those lives... but is it to be, open your eyes to the magical beauty of the story and you will be amazed, as I was.
Stoppard's film adaptation is an entralling piece of cinema and does the play so much justice, as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern spin the story with their words and lovable personalities.  Interpret it in any way you will, but appreciate it as an adorable and tragic tale of two men in the service of a false King, to save a Prince and a friend... but most of all, to save themselves.",989625600,6,3738,4.692660550458716
595323,5,6303191398,"This movie is only 11 years old but it is harder to find than some even older and more obscure films. This is due in part to it being originally released by Buena Vista Films (Disney's main production company), and as we all know Disney is fond of putting movies on moratorium and effectively wiping out any chance of new viewers seeing those films. With that said, if you can get your hands on a copy prepare to be delighted. This movie has moments of brilliance in writing, acting and moviemaking. It is funny, touching and thought-provoking, and features 3 actors, Oldman, Roth and Dreyfuss,  who hadn't quite reached their peaks of stardom yet which makes their performances genuine and facinating. It must be said that this film is NOT a recreation of ""Hamlet"". It is an interpretation of ""Hamlet"" using Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as main, not incidental, characters. If you are looking for a re-hash of ""Hamlet"", this is NOT the movie to watch. From that angle, the movie will seem disjointed and confusing.

What more could you ask for in a film? Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, a story within a story, and an excellent and hilarious screenplay by Tom Stoppard. If you recall your Shakespearean Hamlet you will know that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are minor characters who are brought in to befriend Hamlet in his supposed days of madness. These two men are also given the task of escorting Hamlet to England, where he will be killed. Stoppard has written a witty and challenging script which follows the path of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Overall the script really tells a story within a story. There is the story of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern within the wider Hamlet story. Then of course in the play Hamlet, the title character entreats a traveling theater company to stage a play about the murder of his father. The traveling theater company has crossed paths with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern earlier, and Richard Dreyfuss portrays the ironic leader of the theater troupe. Most definitely a witty and intelligent film.",982800000,5,1221,4.875
595326,4,6303191398,"I enjoy many comedy movies of my era, especially the Adam Sandler movies, but I have never found a movie with a mix of comedy integrated with an intense view from a philosophical standpoint, a view on life, a view on importance.  The phrase ""You never really know how much you mean to someone or something"" has an important role within the film Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  Rosencrantz, played by Gary Oldman, and Guildenstern, played by Tim Roth, leave us falling off our seats and keep us laughing throughout the film.  Tim and Gary play two characters that can't find meaning in their lives.  Scripted around Shakespeare's play Hamlet, these two characters now play the leading role instead of the short 20 verses or less role in which they had in Hamlet.  In the Hamlet and the movie the readers consider them important but in the movie they show how they feel that they weren't given a substantial role in the life of Hamlet and death of the family.  They weren't as involved so now they attempt to get involved with no clue about what is suppose to happen at the end of the play.  They don't realize their destiny until they are told in a way that does not go around the truth, at the last final minute upon death.  The Player, played by Richard Dreyfuss, leads Rosencrantz and Guildenstern down the road hinting at many times of why they are actually here.  The play eventually ends up in chronological order, the two talk to Hamlet on his troubles, Hamlet rewrites the letter that the King has given to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and eventually the two end up dead.  The play has eight individuals that die in it, as does the movie.  Near the end Rosencrantz and Guildenstern figure that only six are to die.  Six members within the family have already faced their deaths and the story was over.  The player plays a tremendous role in this part of the film.  He acts as King and asks them to open their letter that has been given so graciously to them and that Hamlet had so deviously changed.  The letter that they are given, states that they must be put to death.  They still do not understand and when this message kicks in they try to prove it wrong when all along they were trying to find their existence within the story.  When they find it, they don't want it.  I find this very interesting since all of us, human nature, is trying to find some sort of meaning to our lives at that particular point.  The same question that religion, science, and medicine all try to answer and have not found.  But the question still remains and I leave you with this question, do we really want to know how the world was formed and why we are here?  My answer to this is no.  I would rather live my full life with my own beliefs instead of someone telling me that this is a proven fact and I must believe this otherwise I will rot in hell. Don't worry about why you exist instead be grateful that you are still here!  All in all the movie was fantastic, I truly enjoyed all the actors and the characters they played within it.

Needs to be in wide distribution,  especially now that Wm Shakespear has been ""discovered"" by  hollywood.",940032000,,430,5.235294117647059

And negative.
This is a very pretentious film. If you want to see what is, basically, the film-makers showing you how smart they are, this is your film!
Of course, if you like pretention, this film will be right down your alley.
Still, it is well done in a technical sense, and you might find it entertaining.

7840764,5,6303191398,"The scene closes in on Rosencrantz & Guildenstern or is it Guildenstern & Rosencrantz discussing the odds of a flipped coin coming up heads. What seems to be a casual curiosity is the setting for the eventual outcome of the story. If the names sound familiar then you will recognize them from the play ""Hamlet"". Their story was never fully told until now.

Through out the film we get snippets of Hamlet and visions of what is to come. The real fun is in the fact that the dialog and the actors could have easily been seamlessly slipped into the original play.

Their play on words not only matches Shakespeare but a good dose of Lewis Carroll; ""Toes on the other hand"",""Don't you mean the other foot?""

Disperses through the story Rosencrantz (Gary Oldman) makes all the great discoveries from gravity to flight to steam engines and so forth. Every time he goes to show them to Guildenstern (Tim Roth) they are overlooked, or dismissed.

The only person that was a tad over the top, acting like he was acting wad Richard Dreyfuss as the leader of the acting troop. However this is one movie that you can get away with it.",1506038400,,1122,4.53960396039604
