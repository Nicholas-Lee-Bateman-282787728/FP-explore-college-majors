8711741,5,B00J9IRCWS,I definitely laughed out loud with this movie.  Yes it was a silly rom com but it surely was entertaining.  A Thumbs Up.,1517184000,,120,4.173913043478261
8711742,5,B00J9IRCWS,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. I love the incredible range of emotional expression by the main actors, Lee Si-young and Oh Jung-se. They are both ultra talented and attractive. The story is a fun Cinderella-type fairy tale. The fairy godfather is magical and devoted. He and his assistants add so much quirky charm to the story. The supporting cast, especially Lee Sung-jae's manager and his little dog, Constantine are great and fun, as well. The story reminds me somehow of another of my favorites, yet a very different movie, I Love Huckabees. In the end ""HTUGWST"" is all about the tender heart and the authentic self that shine through, find love and raise the hairs on my arm! Quite worthwhile to watch and enjoy!",1513728000,,731,4.71875

8711745,5,B00J9IRCWS,"This is a quirky comedy that feels like watching an anime.  Not your typical Korean Rom-Com but if you keep an open-mind, you might be pleasantly surprised.  I should give it 4 starts but gave it 5 just because of the director's creativity.",1508544000,,240,4.558139534883721
8711746,4,B00J9IRCWS,"Cute move with funny characters. The storyline was predictable (as most rom-coms tend to be) but I enjoyed how this love story was a little different from most. The actors did a great job in portraying their quirks and revealing how the past shaped them to be who they were in the present. My only annoyance (at times) was the intermittent tips given through the host of the tape ""How to use guys with secret tips."" Overall, I enjoyed the move. It had me in stitches at the end. A story of failures and major comebacks...especially in the arena of love.",1504828800,,553,4.485148514851486
