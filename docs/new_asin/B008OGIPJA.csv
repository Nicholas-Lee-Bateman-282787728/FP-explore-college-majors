5171573,5,B008OGIPJA,"I won't bore you with a synopsis of the film, which by now should be quite familiar to everyone.  But I will say that the acting is simply superb -- particularly Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, as the coming-together thirty-somethings with a shared disheveled past and an emotional steamer trunk full of similar disconnects.  (DeNiro goes without saying.)  The way in which these real people connect their loose wires is a testament both to the author and to the director (David Russell) of this comic tale of human interaction.  You will long remember the characters and you will never forget the story.  This film is an example of what Hollywood can do well but unfortunately does far less frequently now by sacrificing the stories of real people on the altar of special effects, morphing and extended adolescent superhero nonsense.  Kudos to the Weinsteins for continuing to have the courage to bring us memorable tales like these.

5171574,5,B008OGIPJA,"Definitely Oscar-worthy! I think what I most appreciated was the character development. You really get to know what makes the characters tick, allowing the viewer to really care about them. The performances are superb. I highly recommend this one!",1353628800,14,247,5.358974358974359
5171575,4,B008OGIPJA,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012 release; 122 min.) brings the story of Pat (played by Bradley Cooper), whom we see at the start of the movie leaving a state mental institution after an 8 month stay, having been diagnosed as bipolar and having beat up his wife's lover violently when he accidentally intrudes on them. He has lost everything: his wife, his house, basically his life. He moves in with his parents (played by Robert de Niro and Jacki Weaver), determined to win back the graces of his wife, whatever it takes. Then by chance, he meets Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), the younger sister of a family friend. Tiffany has plently of her own troubles. Since there is a restraining order against him, Pat cannot approach his wife directly, so he asks Jennifer to deliver a letter to his wife. Tiffany agrees but only if he does something in return, namely to be her dancing partner in a dancing competition she desperately wants to enter. Pat agrees. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience. Will Pat reunite with his wife? Or will he fall for Tiffany? You'll just have to see it for yourself.

Several comments: this almost feels like two movies into one, as the first hour of the movie centers around the difficult readjustment Pat needs to make in the real world after his release and still dealing with his bipolar condition. It is difficult to like the Pat character because it is difficult to like the outbursts and ups-and-downs of someone being bipolar. In the second hour of the movie, the centers shifts towards the interplay between the Pat and Tiffany characters and the movie then becomes more of a rom-com. Yet it all works just great. One of the biggest surprises for me in this movie is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence (yes, she of ""The Hunger Games""), who brings an astonishing turn with an emotional depth that blows away anything she has done before, that girl can act! But the other performances are top notch too, certainly Bradley Cooper but check out De Niro in his best performance is YEARS. And oh yea, Philadelphia sports play a huge role in this movie, Eagles fans will love the many scenes set in Philadelphia and surrounding the Eagles.

David Russell, who adopted the novel for the screen and directed this, certainly knows a thing or two about bringing dysfunctional families to the big screen (Spanking The Monkey; The Fighter, just to name those) and here he does it again, perhaps better than ever. This movie is already garning serious Oscar buzz, and it's easy to see why. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1353456000,4,2642,4.753812636165577
5171576,5,B008OGIPJA,"Marvelous movie. Heartwarming, Hilarious. Well cast, wonderfuly well acted....especially Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver. The setting: A working class neighborhood in Philadelphia, peopled by obsessed Eagles fans and bettors. The story: Cooper's character, Pat, has spent the last several months in a mental institution, being treated for bi-polar disorder. His ex-wife has taken out a restraining order  on him. Without telling Dad (De Niro), Mom (Weaver) springs Pat and brings him home. Pat has a two-point plan: 1. go off his meds, 2. get his wife back. One day, while out for a run, he runs into a quirky and feisty young widow named Tiffany who's also clinging to sanity by a thread. A wary friendship ensues. Eventually they strike a deal: she'll help him get his wife back in exchange for him helping her win a dance contest. Family and friends get involved, bets are made, stakes are high, and in their own diverse ways, everyone's future is riding on the outcome.

P.S. Lots of interesting outtakes on the DVD extras, plus interesting interviews with the four principal actors and raves from Dr. Oz and others working with those with  bi-polar disorder.",1353110400,18,1198,5.040404040404041

Bradley Coopers' pain riddled, obsessed character is totally believable and I find myself rooting for he & Jennifer to win the Dance Contest each & every time!  Um, did they?

5171581,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is a story about mental illness: something that we, in the Anglo-Saxon world at least, have difficulty dealing with. The main character (Bradley Cooper) is bipolar. Watching him conveying its inevitable behavioral contortions reminded my of my son (22) who is autistic. Whether there's a clinical similarity, I have no idea. What I do empathize with is how his parents tip-toed around every moment of a possible outburst or lapse. The story itself needs no description; just watch the movie. The revelation is Jennifer Lawrence, her self, challenged, emotionally at least, and conveying such with the various early encounters between them. One riveting scene is their conversation in the diner: those who appreciate the topic she was ""opening up to him with"" will recognize its significance. The family and friends' background is both important and touching, with the parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) utterly believable as the ""egg-shell avoiding"" parents; a role I have played often with my boy.",1524873600,,1010,5.2407407407407405

5171603,1,B008OGIPJA,"I saw this movie when other plans fell thru one evening. Cooper and Lawrence are decent enough actors and I don't fault  them in particular, but the movie seemed so disjointed and uninspired and it appears that the actors were making up the dialog as they went along. I found myself becoming annoyed with all the characters. Whiney and quirky is the best way I can  describe them. Bradly Cooper's character ordering Raisin Bran on a dinner date, was just one of bazaar  elements  that I found annoying. I confess to only staying about half way thru the movie before I walked out. I walked over to Trader Joe's to do some shopping and was telling cashier how much I disliked the film, when the guy next to me said he was the theater manager and offered to refund my money. Kudos to him. I suppose that the biggest issue with films today is that I just don't relate to them.

**spoilers below**

So he meets Tiffany, who clearly has something wrong with her. Not sure what. Her husband has died and she's made a few mistakes. Turns out, she and Pat's parents have been working together to manipulate Pat into falling for her. Pat's father also has serious gambling issues and blames Pat when he loses. Through this, Pat realizes that he does love Tiffany (whom he has had no chemistry with nor shown any interest in) and confesses to her int he last moments of the movie.

Mind you, he tells her that he has loved her since he met her, even though you just watched an hour and a half of them fighting, and him trying to get away from her.

Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are fantastic together in this film and the portrayl of behaviors associated with bi-polar and borderline personality disorder are the closest I've seen to my observed reality of those illnesses (without a hopless train wreck as the ultimate conclusion). Great story, solid script and exceptional acting made me care about the characters and become involved in the experience. I strongly recommend this film to anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from mental illness. I truly believe it can help them to understand that the impulsive, erratic, self-destructive and delusional behaviors they sometimes endure are not a choice and cause more pain and suffering to their loved one than they could possibly imagine. I also love the way the film illustrates how so-called ""normal"" people all have their mental health issues; they just haven't been diagnosed, labeled and put in a box by the health care industry and, hence, by everyone in their lives who then judge them based upon a label they can never remove.",1513468800,2,1167,4.959183673469388

5171638,5,B008OGIPJA,"This film has tremendous relevance for me personally, as mental illness runs in my family.  Bradley Cooper portrays a retired school teacher who lives at home with his two parents, and suffers very profoundly with manic-depression after staying in a hospital for a while.  His manic episodes are centered around a wife who cheated on him at his former place of employment, a public school where he was an English teacher.  He has to live within the confines of a restraining order against him (from his ex), and his friends, parents and siblings who want him to find love again.  He shows up on a blind date with one of his married couple friends, to meet Jennifer Lawrence...a lot younger than him, but a widow who is ready to re-enter the singles dating scene.  She has a dance studio where she spends all her time, and is planning to enter a dance contest on New Years Eve.  Bradley Cooper very reluctantly but at the advice and hard pushing of his parents, engages as her dance partner.  His running addiction makes him a fit partner for her.  She doesn't care that he is Bipolar, she just needs a partner.  I have seen this film a couple times and it won best actor for Jennifer Lawrence, based on a scene in the dance contest in the end that showed her determination and hope, and how Bradley Cooper held her up like an Olympian doubles figure skater.  I saw this film in theaters first, then purchased it.

CONS: What did Pat whisper into Nicky's ear?

""That settles that""

the plot

Pat Salatano Jr. is a substitute history teacher who was sentenced to 8 months in a psychiatric hospital after brutally beating a tenured teacher when he found out that he was having an affair with his wife. While away, he found that he had been living with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for years, and he had decided to commit himself to bettering himself inside and out.

His mother had him released a little early, as long as he commits to taking his RX, seeing a therapist via outpatient treatment and adhering to the restraining order his wife Nicky filed against him. Pat was invited to his friend Ronnie's house for dinner one night mainly so his wife Veronica, a friend of Nicky, could evaluate Pat's progress. At the dinner he met Tiffany, Veronica's sister and they bonded immediately as they are both under psychiatric care in some form.

After Pat had a couple of episodes, one at his outpatient psychiatrist's office and one at home, he wanted to get a letter to Nicky explaining himself, because he knew that this would go into a report that Nicky would have access to. He asked his therapist to give her the letter, he refused because of the restraining order. Tiffany agrees to give Nicky the letter but only if Pat agrees to dance with her in a competition at the end of the year.

This results in Pat spending most of his free time with Tiffany practicing a dance routine that they would be performing, much to the chagrin of his father who wishes to watch The Philadelphia Eagles play with him to sweeten the juju for the team and his extravagant wagers.

the breakdown

I could watch this a hundred times and still not get sick of it. The acting is superb and the characters draw you in deep. Robert Deniro as Pat Salatano Sr was funny, and just as neurotic as the rest of the characters. Chris Tucker only had about four scenes, but they were all memorable. Bradley Cooper was brilliant as Pat Salatano Jr, and Jennifer Lawrence was terrific as well. The writing was smart and funny. The dialog is really what cinches this movie for me.

The downside to this film is now I begin to trust Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, especially if they are in another film together. So far, from what I have seen, their chemistry only works here within Silver Linings Playbook.

The soundtrack works well, from Led Zeppelin to The White Stripes to Stevie Wonder, the musical backdrop is both familiar as well as effective.

The film is basically an amazing love story at its core taking a bit of the old reliable formula where the female lead knows that she is in love, while the male doesn't realize until much later despite them spending all of their time together. But here where you throw in Philly pride, mental illness, illegal betting and an insane dance routine, you don't realize the usual formulaic rom-com factors are in play yet again. This is now easily in my top 5 all-time favorites.

5171657,3,B008OGIPJA,"This movie to me is a conflict how I feel!. It is hard to see a movie after the buzz. Lets start for the awards. Jennifer did a good job! She showed a woman that in life I can relate to more than a cartoon stereotype .I saw there is a list of all these actress playing Tiffany and all I can see is Jennifer.  That being said, I think for this movie ""the actors did a better job than the script"". I question how many rewrites!

I have lots of issues with how the story played out..and really the only thing that saves this movie is Brad and Jennifer are both charming actors..that you forget how much lazy holes are in the story..The director is more worried about making a clean high budget art film than making a master piece. I kept watching ,,thinking..he in court appointed metal hospital..how did the mom get him out? How can they afford the bills? Dads not working.. How did he teach with bipolar with no prier medication, if something happens in live does it just get worse? and really I kept having questions! and he was pretty sharp picking up other peoples metal problems..and couldn't see he was toxic on his own relationship..and he was pretty clear at the end..and from the people I know that are about bipolar as he is showing..no medication makes them that clear headed.. as good as Bradley did maybe
shia labeouf could have been better for the role due to the bipolar theme?

 A big shout out to Chris Tucker. I kept saying to myself is that really him!!",1505865600,,1470,4.373626373626373

5171671,5,B008OGIPJA,"On my first view 5 years after its release, Silver Linings Playbook was and was not what I expected.  The acting was excellent (expected) but the somewhat fantastic plot included more realism than anticipated.  Every father-son pair includes the I love you the way you are but you have to change friction that Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) and Pat Jr. (Bradley Cooper) attempt to resolve throughout the movie.  The two continually walk the fine line between normal and crazy, with Pat Jr. pointing out that his fathers insistence on 3 remote controls and a lucky handkerchief to watch a football game is outright OCD.

Similarly, Pat Jr. and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are shocked to find out during their first date that each thinks the other is crazier.  As all of the characters become more closely connected, the line blurs further, e.g. as Pat Jrs seemingly normal friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) describes the symptoms of a panic attack in reaction to the extreme stress in his career and home life.  When things start to spiral out of control, funny and often nonsensical attention to reality diffuses the situation, e.g. Tiffany confronts Pat Srs accusations of bad juju with sports statistics that prove the Philadelphia Eagles win more often when she and Pat Jr. spend time together.  Everyone in the room is mesmerized with her impossible logic, even Pat Jrs psychiatrist!

The ending was at once the least and most realistic part of the movie.  What are the odds that Tiffany and Pat Jr. would enter that elite dance competition?  Just about zero.  How many of us have been thrilled to receive a 5 out of 10 in some area of life that met failure after failure in the making?  Just about everyone.  The movie offers a refreshing resolution for each character, esp. for Tiffany who seemed destined to be used by yet another person.

Wonderful and funny movie that makes the misfit in all of us feel right at home.",1500076800,,1913,4.775075987841945

5171682,5,B008OGIPJA,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related mostly to Jennifer Lawrence's character (despite being much older, not bipolar, and a dude - sue me, haha).  Though Bradley's character could sometimes be relateable, too.  Good movie about 2 flawed, human, real characters coming together and forming a connection in this crazy world.  Anyway, if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1363,4.782051282051282

  many things have been said about this movie.  we liked it because it showed that people can get better in their lives with a little help from professionals.  the idea of drugs to help bi polar people has its merits and drawback for some.  bradley cooper did a pretty amazing job of portraying the main character. now jennifer lawrence always does a great job and continues in this role as the love interest.  she won the academy award for best actress in this role among other top awards for that season.  we saw the movie when it first came out on the big screen, but 5 years later on our own big screen, it still is relevant and outstanding.  how crazy are those fanatics?",1494374400,,683,4.408

5171690,5,B008OGIPJA,"Not your typical romantic comedy and that was one of things that made it great. Characters all had flaws/problems but they never quit trying or gave up. I thought when he chased after her at the end and said ""Hey!"" like she had done to him while jogging earlier in movie was a nice touch.

As great as the entire cast was, without Bradley Cooper we wouldn't be reading this right now. He carried the movie in my opinion and I was shocked to see he didn't win any awards for this but Jennifer won an Oscar. She was great but I didn't think was in enough scenes to win as a lead. She doesn't even appear until minute 25. There are a lot of scenes afterwards she isn't in like when he is in therapy, dealing with his parents, talking with friends, football game, etc.
Her best scene for me was when she saw his wife across the room arriving to the dance. The pain in her eyes/face sold me.

I laughed outloud sometimes, mostly the scenes with DeNiro, and I was rooting for all at the end because the movie succeeded in making me care.",1492387200,6,1031,4.228426395939087

5171792,5,B008OGIPJA,"Overall, if there were higher rating than 5 stars, I would rate Silver Linings as ""6"". It hit all the right points: romance, especially with the ne plus ultra femme Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany (a name very important to me), Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro were very good as well. The film gripped me from beginning to end, and hit all the right ""buttons"". Two thumbs and one big toe up!

The only problem, and it was systemic, was the inaccurate presentation of Bipolar Disorder and mental health issues in general. Patients suffering mania (more likely hypomania in Cooper's character), do not have sudden bursts of rage/activity followed by normal phases. Cooper's character never came near depression, and there was not sufficient explanation of the medications he was taking. Also, the discussion over table about medication side effects was extremely inaccurate. For example, Klonopin (Clonazepam) at typically-prescribed dosages does *not* knock people out unless they have never been on it before; the brain quickly builds tolerance to (and sometimes dependence on) ""K-pins"".

Despite these errors, Silver Linings was the best romance I have ever seen. I suppose it must be called a ""chick flick"", yet if so, it is the only one I would watch again. In fact, I will watch it again, soon. All right, Jennifer Lawrence has a new fan. :)",1477699200,3,1343,4.991071428571429

5171798,5,B008OGIPJA,"The blurbs for this film made me think of the Japanese original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>&nbsp;and its American remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B006S8QY8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>&nbsp;And the films do share a little DNA here and there. Even the dance song ""Sway"" makes its appearance in this film, as it did in Shall We Dance?

But this film is not really a dance movie. It's a movie about those with mental illness coping with their feelings. Two deeply flawed people struggle to overcome their flaws and have a tough time of it. Those around them, well meaning as they are, have their own flaws to deal with. Everybody, it turns out, has something bothering them.

That said, this film is a comedy, and there's nothing dark or deep about it. Drugs (Pat and Tiffany list off a long list of drugs they have tried), psychotherapy, and even 8 months in a mental hospital were Pat's prescription for his mental illness. But it turns out that the real solution was more friends and family living and loving together that let them all experience a livable life, full of ups and downs but avoiding the deepest pits of mental illness.

The writing, directing, and acting in this film were excellent. The title is a little odd, and there are things here and there that just didn't work. The profanity seems a little overblown too. But where lesser movies turn to cliche, this film turned to fresh takes on stock situations. That freshness was refreshing. The film was full of little surprises that caught me, a somewhat jaded film watcher, by surprise.

To avoid any spoilage, I have left out details in this review. Better to watch this film without knowing what is coming. But it's definitely worth watching. The many Oscars and other film awards and nominations are well deserved. I'm not sure how this film will stand the test of time -- it's not a great film -- but it seems destined to get new fans for a few years at least.",1476489600,,2138,5.297935103244837

5171802,4,B008OGIPJA,"I love this movie despite the fact that there are so many continuity mistakes in it. It's one of those movies I like to watch in the fall. The story, despite all of the obvious errors, which are actually kind of funny, is kind of uplifting, even with all of the mental illness story lines going on.

Let me give you some examples of obvious mistakes. Pat Solitano comes home from the psychiatric hospital and no one, except his mom, knows that he's coming home. He goes out to jog and runs into his best friend unpacking a car of groceries. The friend is surprised to see him and surprised that he's out of the hospital but then says his wife has asked him to come to dinner that week. A few seconds later, the wife pokes her head out of the window and says Did you ask him? If they didn't know he was out of the hospital, how could they have planned a dinner for him?

There's a scene where a dude comes to Tiffany's house for a booty call and tells her parents that he knows Tiffany and that's he's called and texted but hasn't heard back. When Pat gets involved and escorts the dude away from the house, and the guy says, She just texted me! And yet there are no phones in the scene and he just said she hasn't responded to him. PLUS, Tiffany is hiding behind the door listening and is NOT texting!

The Cop. Can we talk about the cop? This cop assigned to Pat's case apparently works 24/7 and always within a few seconds distance from Pat Solitano. He works during the day. He works in the middle of the night when Pat is going crazy. He just happens to be working on Halloween on the exact street that Pat has a spur of the moment meltdown. Also, the song that disturbs Pat  My Cherie Amour  just happens to be broadcast on a random street in front of a movie theater on Halloween? It's not like that song is even mainstream at this point in time  how would it just magically start playing on a random street on Halloween night?

There are so many other things too  mistakes in EVERY scene. Pat walks into the studio with his shoes duct taped and then you see Tiffany duct taping.  There are mistakes in almost every scene with wardrobe, jewelry, positioning of people, factual issues, and on and on.

So while I'm watching this, I get extremely frustrated and yet the story ends up transcending the poor movie-making skills of the director and crew.

But I have to say, the soundtrack is amazing and the underlying story works on many levels. It's still an emotional film. Just viewed it again last night and I laughed at some of the obvious errors, but in the end, it works.",1475971200,,2581,4.31198347107438

I adore the lead actors, and I can only assume this is why the movie has such high reviews. They did their part and acted out their scenes well- but the scenes, the writing, the storyline- were all absolutely, mind-numbingly BORING.

If you're into mental health based movies, watch Girl, Interrupted. That movie will send you through so many emotions and give you an actual moving storyline. There are other good ones too, such as A Beautiful Mind and Sybil, but Girl, Interrupted is fantastic.",1473033600,,634,4.660714285714286

5171842,5,B008OGIPJA,"I absolutely adored this movie because the entire premise of the story is so real.  Set is a middle class suburb it is a story of Pat and Tiffany.  Both are young, yet deeply wounded by the loss of their partner.  Pat spent almost a year in a mental institution after he caught his wife Nikki with another man in their home and beat the unfortunate soul nearly to death.  He just snapped and could not break away form his anger, despair and heartbreak.  Tiffany, on the other hand is a widow who lost her husband after 3 years of marriage.  She is just as troubled as Pat I only she expresses her grief, sadness and depression by being promiscuous.  As it happens, neither sex nor prescription drugs can dull their emotional pain and as life will have it, the two form the unusual alliance trying to help each other.  Of course, their is unconventional friendship and they both fight their demons, sometimes in their solitude and more often than that they battle out their demons in front of each other.

I absolutely loved the cast of this movie.  Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany and she is fantastic.  Her sadness is so palpable, one can almost touch it.  What is even more amazing is that her blond, angle like sister who has seemingly perfect life with a suburban house, husband and a child is played by Julia Styles who truly looks like Jennifer's sister.  The two of them look almost identical, only one has a dark hair and the other is blonde.  Bradley Cooper gives a fabulous performance as Pat who is obsessed with idea of getting his wife back at any cost.

Then of course, there is Robert DeNiro who is playing Pat Senior.  Here is the helpless father who can do nothing but watch his son suffer.  Pat Sr. has his own challenges.  He has lost his pension, and makes living placing bets on a football games.  I mean only Robert DeNiro can pull something like that.

I loved this movie from start to finish.  I also loved the idea that crazy people are portrayed as sensitive souls and they are moving around the world with a different set of eye and sometimes values.  Of course, they get judged and called crazy, but it is human touch and love they crave and they will do anything (that ""normal"") person would not to get what they truly want.  After all, they do not care about filters, they do not care about being judged by other people, they just want to LIVE and not have to conform.

Recommended for guys who are football fans (especially Eagles fans) as well as their wives/girlfriends who hate the sport.  There's a fair amount of profanity, so it's not for the little ones.

Not just a chick flick, this delves into relationships as a whole between parents and children, siblings, friends, spouses, and work.

The scene were the ""big bet"" is so damn contrived and illogical that it's embarrassing and ruined everything they'd built in the first two acts. And it's freaking illogical. Anyone, especially a bookie knows a double or nothing bet is not a big deal, you just have to make another bet at the same number. You don't need to parlay it or give more points. Lazy lazy lazy.

I also like when Jennifer is listing the scores of the games she was with Cooper ... she mentions the Eagles beating the Seahawks 14-7. Well, they'd said earlier in the film that the Eagles were BEATING the Seahawks 27-10. WTF. How freaking lazy. There's also a scene where Jennifer is taping Cooper's shoe's with duct tape.

5171991,3,B008OGIPJA,"One has to respect the experiences of the author Matthew Quick and the director David O. Russell, who have had experiences within their own lives and families with illnesses like depression and bi-polar disorder, and both have testified to the fact that the book and the movie were undertaken as ways of dealing with, to some extent, the difficulties brought about by such illnesses.  And the movie has been very successful -- Americans seem to love the idea that emotional and mental illness (and of course, cognitive impairment and cancer) can be the bases of uplifting stories.  And sometimes, in ""real life,"" they can be.  More often, of course, they are disturbing, frightening, and financially and emotionally draining, both for the sufferers and those who seek to take care of them.  I sometimes wonder if the desire to see uplift in such stories -- the ""silver lining"" -- isn't a way of assuring ourselves that we are seeing these sufferers as people like ourselves and that we would never think of marginalizing them.  One would hope that we wouldn't marginalize them, but let's face it: they're not exactly like (and sometimes not at all like) those of us who are lucky enough not to be thus afflicted, and it bothers me to see them turned into occasions for comedy, for these enable in us a covert kind of self-congratulation: we see them as people and covertly congratulate ourselves for empathizing.  But one can't get away from the fact that the conventions of comedy  -- in this case romantic comedy -- blunt or fuzz up the representation of the difficulties of emotional illness.  We can't believe in the suffering of Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) when they don't seem credibly endangered or a source of danger.  It doesn't help that Pat's doctor is a broadly comic figure or that Tiffany's ""normal"" sister and brother-in-law seem more out of touch with reality than Tiffany does.  Pat's obsessive-compulsive father (Robert De Niro, wasted) has a fixation with the Philadelphia Eagles that is more a source of comedy than anything else.  To sum up, most of these people (including Danny [Chris Tucker], Pat's friend from the hospital in Baltimore where Pat has spent 8 months) are, in some degree, charming, and charming just doesn't cut it in a movie that purports to take emotional suffering seriously.

As most readers will know, Tiffany talks Pat into partnering her in a dance competition, and they practice a lot.  We're to take it that the practice becomes a kind of emotional discipline and, in itself, a source of stability for both.  Fair enough -- and, to the film's credit, in the competition they are (credibly) not very good at all, but they're good enough to bring about a happy conclusion to a rather contrived betting situation that Pat's dad has set up, and -- in best romantic comedy vein -- good enough to discover each other, as each realizes what the other has done for him or her.  I didn't think much of the movie, but the actors are pros, and they give it a whirl -- my quarrel isn't with them.  It's with the whole concept.  I just hope DeSean Jackson was reimbursed for the use (or abuse!) of his name.",1447977600,,3168,4.762340036563072

On paper, they're perfect set up and even on film.

The film includes Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver as Pat's parents. They're marvelous in the film. They filmed on location in the Philadelphia area. The story is about mental illness and living in today's world. The film is beautifully done with sensitivity and care.

5172021,1,B008OGIPJA,"I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately it turned out to be an awful mess. At the beginning Cooper does a good job portraying Pat, the mentally ill character who is obsessed by his ex-wife and struggles to go back to a normal life. [Attention: SPOILERS ahead.] He then meets Tiffany who is a nymphomaniac but of course she is very chaste and we don't see a centimetre square of skin because this is a movie for families (not that I would be interested anyway).

Lawrence is a model-type (very wrong casting in my opinion, I think a ""girl next door"" type would have been a better choice) and while in any other movie (or in real life) she would have hundreds of men courting her, here she falls for Pat and chases him while he goes running. Although her being a model-type, he doesn't seem too impressed with her, not even when she gives him lectures about life while doing what seem a very sexy yoga poses with her buttocks well in sight.

Pat's parents don't like Tiffany because of her nymphomaniac fame, but when she starts listing the scores of some sport, they look at her amazed and suddenly start to like her. At this point, if you had given the movie a little chance, it becomes involuntarily comic and you just want to head to the exit.

Then you have the predictable scene of the dance competition at the end of which poor Tiffany is left alone in the street like a soaked kitten (Pat has caught sight of his ex-wife and at this point you start hoping that the two get together again). But - surprise surprise! - Pat realises at last that he's actually in love with Tiffany and the two get together and live happily ever after.

The movie constantly swings between drama and comedy, but it seems to head nowhere, except to ridiculous. The real low point is Lawrence who has the same sulky expression all through the movie and can't express one single feeling (how she won an Oscar Award is beyond me). I can't believe De Niro accepted to play in this mess, either.",1443916800,2,1988,4.438356164383562

5172078,4,B008OGIPJA,"Nowhere on the movie did it describe that Bradley Cooper's character was manic depressive/bipolar. I truly wished it was mentioned as it shouldn't be a secret. It isn't something that people need to be ashamed of, or hide. As a family member of mine had this, and sadly passed away due to it, I don't take it lightly. I probably wouldn't have bought it because of the pain his death caused my family. But, for those who have never been in contact with a person with this it's extremely eye opening. And, I hope it helps in understanding what a person with bipolar deals with daily.... The stigma that goes along with this is sad, and people can be very cruel and unloving. Overall, the movie is spot on as to how one with bipolar behaves and how those around them are affected. I did like it, and would recommend it, just be prepared for an emotional journey....",1438041600,,862,4.462025316455696

It's based on the story about two disenfranchised people who find each other, and at first aren't all too thrilled with one another. Circumstances pull them together - somewhat out of a need to use what the other has or is capable of providing. There's a huge amount of turmoil for the character played by Bradley Cooper, who plays a man who suffers with bi-polar, which he plays brilliantly. The character played by Jennifer Lawrence adds stability to Cooper, even though she's struggling with her own problems - which aren't small.

The culmination, and lead up to the culmination, are incredibly poignant and beautifully played out by both Cooper and Lawrence! Who knew Cooper could dance so well! Lawrence, of course, as a dancer lends so much to this part! A coming of age love story of sorts for a couple older than the normal coming of age story, is one that will stick to your heart --- even if the title always eludes me!  : )

On the level with The Notebook, I very highly recommend this lovely story!",1437091200,,1195,4.544186046511628

It's different in a simple but believable way. Sure, some of the scenes (such as the recitation of the football stats) might have been on the cheesy side, but overall,  the storyline and dialogue just worked. I also wished Chris Tucker had played a bigger and funnier role, but that's just a personal preference. You'll experience a range of emotions watching this movie; that's how engrossing it is.

Perhaps if you are a numb ""normie"", then you don't have what it takes to appreciate the accuracy of families dynamics, enabling, OCD and bi-polar disorder, depression, loss-grief, rage and acting out. But this movie is spot on. All families have dysfunction and despite this, there are redeeming values in many families and this movie is deeply realistic, honest and positive. The scenes in the parents bedroom and the attic had me crying with laughter. And the east coast suburban socio-economic status and sports subculture were perfect. How anyone could say this movie is boring (?) is beyond me. Perfectly cast, perfectly, and perfectly acted. It is so spot on, you will laugh as to how close to home it hits.

Their attraction is instant, but the relationship can't be realized until Pat finally gets past his obsession with his wife who for good reason has a restraining order against him.  Tiffany had lost her husband in an accident and had since lived angry, depressed, and acting out sexually until Pat came along.  The two grow together and heal each other and finally end up in each other's arms.  I loved this movie so, so much.

I watched the special features part and wished that all the deleted scenes were in the movie. I know they have to edit the movie but I would 've liked to be able to buy the movie without any deleted scenes. Just my opinion.

5172207,2,B008OGIPJA,"Personally, I don't get the hype. This wasn't the most horrible movie I've ever seen, worth a watch, but to me, this movie's achievements were all in the performances, not in the story itself, so I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a movie. And I don't get the BFD about JLaw in this one. If they wanted someone to yell at Bradley Cooper at the top of her lungs for two hours while wearing workout wear and acting a hot mess, I could have done that myself. For way less money. Though admittedly, she looks much better doing it than I would. However, I don't see the Oscar-worthiness at all.",1426982400,2,603,4.298245614035087

I ordered the movie found out fast it wasn't just a chick flick I quickly found out why she won. I loved the movie no other actress could have pulled it off the way she did. I hunted for all the movies she stared in or just in, she owned them all. Both her and Cooper played bipolar s who was introduced the movie began from there. He would say something to her that set her off she in turn say something to him that set him off. (Possible Spoiler stop reading)  Each were normal till he found his wife in the shower with another man he went off and beat the $hit out of him she left him he thinks they are still in love and wants everything  back to the way it was.

It is a love story that is not your typical, and it addresses the mental health struggle with some people that are trying best to cope and move on with their lives after having life events that had pushed them over the edge.

I loved the characters in the movie and I believe they did a great job with playing off of each other and acting.

It is a bit wacky and may not be for everyone, as I did note with myself some of the family squabbles were a bit nerve touching for me, but that was one thing that I also thought was great about this movie. It did touch a nerve, but was not full out triggering, meaning the actors did a good job with portraying that dysfunctional family/relationships.

After being discharged, he lives with his parents Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver. He rebuilds his life and wants to reunite with his wife who has separated from him. His father is obsessed with Philadelphia Eagles and gets into regular bets on their games. Solatano's life changes when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). She is instrumental in helping him reconnect with his wife but only if he helps her out in her ambitions.

The blu ray was viewed on a 60inch Samsung 120hz with 600 CMI and looked amazing. as for sound I use 5.1 surround, phillips, 1000watts with 8in sub. the dialogue was crisp and clear the scenes with music were sounded great as well. the extras aren't that great. a few deleted scenes, and some commentary about the dance scenes, and a q and a session. but it does come with the blu ray, the dvd, digital copy, and UV copy so thats a big plus.

5172269,2,B008OGIPJA,"This movie was recommended to me to watch because I have bipolar disorder.  The person who recommended this does not, but is a close personal friend. This movie was not entertaining to me.  The balancing act of managing mood swings isn't funny, and patients don't sit around talking about their meds.  It's personal.  That's something you talk about with your psychiatrist when you know you need a med adjustment.  This movie is geared toward people who have a family member with bipolar disorder, and it's difficult for them, not funny.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with bipolar disorder, family members, or friends of a bipolar patient.  Too many difficult issues to relive, or past experiences for all concerned.  That's what real life counseling is for to help everyone to cope.  Maybe someone would say I'm being oversensitive, but I'm just being upfront and not recommending this movie to people dealing with this disorder, or those close to them.",1424304000,2,967,4.99375

5172287,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is an amazing film that takes viewers on an emotional journey the way few films do.  With an astonishing screenplay and incandescent performances, Silver Linings Playbook reaches deep down into emotional territory, compels us to do the same, and demands our unflinching attention when Tiffany exhorts, Thats a feeling!  They say that actors inhabit characters, but that great actors allow characters to inhabit them.  What a joy it is to watch these actors, at the top of their game, inhabited by rich, deeply developed, multidimensional characters full of joy and sadness, desire and dread, love and disdain, each contending in his own way with the inherent tug of war within between the tendency toward indifference and the aching desire for deep emotional experiencefor a begrudging love of life in spite of it all.  The film is a cornucopia of generously textured performances, but especially so with Cooper and Lawrence, who are heart-breaking and stunning in ways that can be difficult to convey in wordsways that reach down and touch an emotional core even for viewers who didn't know they had one.  And isn't that what emotional recovery for all of us is really all about . finding ones emotional core and reactivating it.  With Cooper and Lawrence, nothing more is required to break your heart than a simple facial expression, a movement of the eyes, or a brief action.  There are microscopic moments in this filmwhen Pat hugs an unexpecting former employer, or when Tiffany locks flirtatious eyes on Pat and says, Lets go see the house.that embrace more tenderness and pathos than other pictures manage to capture in their entirely.  If I were a filmmaker, Silver Linings would make me a very jealous one for sure.  Is it a love story told against the backdrop of emotional recovery or a story of emotional recovery told against the backdrop of a love story?  You decide.  But theres no denying that Silver Linings is a beautiful film about lifes joy and sorrow, and about a responsibility that each of us has  to face his own pain squarely  to go through the pain rather than be destroyed by it  to do the next hard thing  to create in each of our lives a silver lining.  A famous man once wrote, The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.  But that only happens when the pain is transformed, by doing the next hard thing, into a road map to personal recovery, and hopefully with the support of family, friends, and professionals.  Like Dr. Patel says to Pat: The silver lining thing is yours [if you want it]  This crazy sad s*** as you call it made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.  To Dr. Patel and this magical collaboration of filmmakers, we respond: Message received, loud and clear!",1422835200,,2824,4.807453416149069

Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert DeNiro give amazing outstanding performances.  I love that it takes place in Philadelphia and shows the craziness of Eagles football.  The acting is superb, Jennifer Lawrence is ridiculously good and the story is exceptional.  I loved it!",1422144000,,377,5.8
5172296,4,B008OGIPJA,"Quick story recap: A man with deep emotional problems loses his marriage and tries everything to get his wife back,  meets equally troubled woman, befriends her to enlist her help to get his wife back.  I thought it was a good movie but would only recommend if you enjoy irreverent dark humor.  It's a crazy movie, you can't believe the stuff these characters do and say. It's pretty funny in the aspect of people saying wildly inappropriate things.

Excellent cast does impress as very weird people.  Jennifer Lawrence always does a good job in her character roles. Bradley Cooper is spot on with his character.  Also great acting from Robert De Niro.

This is a weird take on a romantic comedy, one that if you are looking for a date night movie might be a good choice since it won't bore either party. It's goofy characters get a good ending.",1422057600,,845,4.593333333333334

5172298,5,B008OGIPJA,"Like many others, I really enjoyed this film. I enjoyed it for the finesse with which it tackled tough issues like mental illness while remaining relatable and entertaining.  I enjoyed it for the way in which it showed how love is built with time, trust and common experiences.  I enjoyed it for its ability to squeeze out a positive ending that didn't feel clichd in the least. I enjoyed it for the brilliant performances by both of its leads as well as the other actors, all of whom fully inhabit their characters' unique quirks and flaws.  I enjoyed the fact that it's not an easy film to classify - sure it has aspects of RomCom but there is so much depth that it would be difficult to slap with that label. I enjoyed its message that nobody is really 100% sane, and the best any of us can do is find those who accept us for who we are.  I spent the entire runtime of the movie feeling consistently engaged, not looking for plot holes (I honestly don't know if there were any!) or doubting that any of this was believable. The film sucked me into its world and kept me there until the end. That's about as much as I can ask of a film and this one delivered. So I highly recommend this Playbook to anyone who wants a quirky, hard-fought-uplifting movie about growth by coming to terms with oneself.",1421884800,,1301,4.363636363636363

The crazy episodes were a bit unsettling to me, I wanted to stop the movie and tell them what they needed to do to change their lives but I carried on.

All this movie did was piss me off and stress me out. Its nothing but temper tantrums, fighting, yelling, and arguing. Two main characters are majorly Bi-polar. Pat just got on my nerves and his obsession with his ex wife Nikki. Enough!! The movie didn't seem to go anywhere and actually had to turn it off.",1421366400,,483,4.204301075268817

I couldn't stand all the overblown bickering. Deniro, especially got on my last nerve, playing an even more absurd ass than he does in ""Meet the Parents""  It  grated on my nerves. The rest of the story got more and more unrealistic. The ONLY thing I like about it is them talking about the anti deppressants and that someone likes to dance. It was just pure b.s.. A ton of hot air. Extremely overrated. They never figured out what they wanted the movie to be about so threw a bunch of crap in there and let it brew.",1421020800,9,666,4.40650406504065

5172322,3,B008OGIPJA,"It's the classic ""big fish in a small pond"" syndrome; the romantic comedy genre is so weak nowadays that when a movie like Silver Linings Playbook comes along, while entertaining and refreshingly quirky (director David O. Russell's specialty) it doesn't really stay with you. Don't get me wrong, I liked it fine with terrific performances by Lawrence (she deserved every bit of that Oscar) and De Niro (who finally gets a good script in which to flex his considerable acting muscles); but never did I fall head- over-heels in love with it. Something inconsistent crippled the whole film; maybe it was supposed to be that way given the ups-and-downs of mental illness in a larger, more general way, but I never felt much for Bradley Cooper's character even though his eyes did most of the acting in this film and that was very subtle and cool. The Chris Tucker character confused me at first because he didn't seem real. I thought he was one of those narrative devices; kind of like Bradley Cooper's imaginary friend who he talks to in order to get encouragement. Anyways, while not an instant classic, Silver Linings Playbook made for an enjoyable afternoon and maybe that's what it was meant to do all along.",1420934400,,1209,4.7894736842105265

5172363,5,B008OGIPJA,"I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!  There were so many ways to watch this movie.  So far, I've watched it 4 times.  What stands out in my mind is the way mental illness is addressed in the movie.  I believe Silver Lining Playbook was ground-breaking in its handling of the issue in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.  Also, the interplay of ALL the characters was outstanding.  It was really incredible watching Bradley Cooper interplay with Jennifer Lawrence&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Linings-Playbook/dp/B00A81MV3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Linings Playbook</a>&nbsp;as well as Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver.  Each and every person stood out on their own and as a part of the movie.  From Pat Jr.'s psychiatrist to Danny (Chris Tucker) the mental hospital buddy, EVERYTHING FIT TOGETHER like a 5,000 piece jigsaw puzzle.  Silver Linings Playbook will stand out in my mind always as a phenomenal piece of movie history that deals with all aspects of the human spirit and soul with deep knowledge and kindness.",1419379200,4,1088,5.7924528301886795

5172382,4,B008OGIPJA,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie.  Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing in this film, but I guess I didn't feel that the film did a very good job of resolving the conflicts in the film very well.  The thing that bothers me the most about this is how this Nikki girl seems to be totally holding this guy hostage, as if she did nothing wrong -but she CHEATED on him.  They made him seem like he was the one who is insane, but I don't think it is insane to respond in an aggressive manner when you find someone in your home who you did not invite into your home, in your shower, making love to your wife - that seems completely and totally rational for someone to stand their ground in this situation.  It isn't insane to do whatever you have to do to remove this person from your home.  And it would have been rational for him to divorce his wife, she was the one who cheated on him.  He obviously felt very committed to his vows, but Jesus himself said that if someone cheats on you - you have a right to divorce them.  He should have been done with her a long time ago, but he can't seem to let go.  It was a strong lesson for me in that if you have to jump all these hoops for a woman to love you - then she isn't right for you.  The thing that I find odd is that the main character can't see the forest through the trees.  Here's a woman who is obviously good for him, and he can't see it.  Honestly, I wish I was so lucky to find someone who genuinely cared about me and who was good for me.  They call people insane a lot of times, but I think it is normal to have certain feelings when you go through a lot of trauma.",1418601600,,1640,3.966463414634146
5172383,5,B008OGIPJA,"I just love Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.  This is the story of a young man who has spent some time in a mental hospital... gets released and is trying to have a life outside of his mental illness.  Jennifer Lawrence is a young woman who has had her own issues with the untimely death of her husband.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the two meet and enter a dance contest. This movie would be great for a date night... it is more adult with themes and language.. in case that matters to you.",1418428800,,510,4.237113402061856

The movie was really well written and acted and I actually really like the changes that were made. The book was so, so good, and that made me concerned I wouldn't like the movie because I knew they had made some really pretty pronounced changes. But honestly, it's made so well and there's so much heart in what they did I'm glad I got to see what I'll call the ""revised"" version. Four stars for not sticking more to the source material just on principle, but I really did like it very much.",1418083200,,663,4.228346456692913

They had the perfect chemistry. I think Jennifer Lawrence is one of the greatest actresses around today. She hasn't made a bad movie yet. I recommend this movie highly.

Academy Award winners are hit and miss for me. But I had a bunch of long plane trips this year, and finally watched the movie on a two hour flight in August.
It lived up to the hype. I genuinely liked the characters, and rooted for them. I laughed out loud, and yes, I did shed several tears. The person next to me must have been waiting for the credits to roll, because as soon as they did he turned to me and said, ""wasn't that phenomenal"" and proceeded to rave about the movie himself.",1416268800,,640,4.047244094488189

I've watched it three times since it came out. The way it was written does so much to educate people about the daily lives of people dealing with mental illness and how their families are affected. Really done well. DeNiro's portrayal of a gambler with OCD is spot on. I think I liked his performance over all the rest, but no surprise.....he is the man!

Where is the gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence?  Buried in some kind of sweat suit as she jogs around with what--her lover to be, who's caught up in himself and his imaginary world.  It's like an adaptation of a play--two people talking interminably.  There are a few scenes with Robert De Niro thrown in which highlight the craziness of our hero, although De Niro's character isn't exactly what you would call normal either.  The result here is that there is no emotional feeling aroused in the viewer.  We have no sympathy for the characters at all, just a sort of bored resignation.",1413676800,,727,4.68503937007874

What I do find hilarious is that Nikki places a restraining order against Pat, like SHE'S the victim or something. Yeah Pat reacted violently, but did he lay a finger on HER? I guess Nikki thought the restraining order was a good way to prevent Pat from walking in on any of her future affairs...lol! And Pat calls TIFFANY a slut...sheesh!

*SEMI SPOILER ALERT* Sure, Tiffany reveals that she had a much wilder sexual history but of course she was suffering from a mental illness of her own. So the idea of Tiffany and Pat hooking up is great so they can help heal each other, and Nikki can go take a flying leap...whether or not she first sleeps with every other teacher in the school...lol!",1412985600,,947,4.762195121951219

5172533,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is a romantic comedy about two people with some psychological troubles. Both leading actors are very good and the portrayal of people with problems of that kind is done decently and is not embarrassing or annoying i think.
The story is about some very common people. The story is quite simple at first, but even at this level is enjoyable. But the story can be quite rich and non trivial if one bothers to pay attention to the finer details which are not fully explored by the director since he focuses mostly on two main characters and their path to fix their kind of troubled  minds. There several funny scenes with the two main actors.
There are a lot of older time songs that i like a lot. There is the excellent ""if you're traveling to the north country..."" by B.Dylan and J.Cash, there is a Christmas song with Frank Sinatra, ""sway"" but not from Dean Martin, the B.Cooper's character wedding song ""goodnight moon"", S.Wonder, some D.Brubeck and others.

5172549,4,B008OGIPJA,"This movie has perhaps the best depiction of mental health problems, but played by an implausibly attractive cast. Both lead characters suffer from bipolar with Bradley Cooper also showing schizophrenia. I really liked how they flashbacked to the situation that triggered his break. A bit less is revealed about Jennifer Lawrence's character, but she is still adequately fleshed out. As the story begins, both characters are in a recovery of sorts and happen to cross paths. Like any grade school crush, they do more to push the other person away than try any courtship.

As the movie progresses, the story is built up with secondary characters which shows how mental health issues can affect others and how many times it is hereditary. Cooper and Lawrence use the other in a mutually beneficial manner to get them to a spot that they believe is best for them. Along the way, inevitably, there is an attraction and complicated feelings.

Dancing plays a significant part to Lawrence's storyline. It is presented in a believable way. At no time was I distracted by trying to figure out if a body double was used.

5172555,5,B008OGIPJA,"There have been notable performances over the decades by actors who did not receive an Oscar for the role only they could have played:  Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo was one,  Robin Williams' Andrian Cronauer or TS Garp were others.  The same is true of Bradley Cooper in this movie.  Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor to be sure, but who did not fall asleep during Lincoln?  I'm not a professional movie reviewer and do not presume to have the skills to replace Roger Ebert so any dissection of this movie would take up too much space and time to read.  Buy this movie and watch it in your own time.  The best cure in Patrick's life were the women in his life.  While watching it note that Robert DeNiro's father was bipolar and Bradley Cooper had just lost his.  The best scene in the movie is when Patrick is looking for his wedding video.  Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar especially in light of her very young age when she filmed this movie.  Also, bear in mind she was also nominated for Winters Bone which was, I believe, her first starring role.  This movie paid for itself in its first viewing.

5172556,5,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook is a terrific, top-notch film with acting performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence worthy of many awards.  Lawrence, in particular, is surprisingly good with her acting virtuosity showing great range and skill.  The main character is released from a mental facility.  His life has fallen apart and he has now been diagnosed as bipolar.  His wife has a restraining order against him and he is obsessed with getting back together with her.  There is an incident he recalls about finding her in the shower with a fellow high school teacher and beating the guy near to death, but its not entirely clear if he is recalling it accurately as he also called the police a week earlier to report his wife and the other teacher plotting against him.  The story focuses on the lead characters struggles to function in life without losing it all, to co-exist with his father (played by Robert DeNiro), who is football-crazy and spends his days running bets on games and trying to find good-luck charms that will help the Eagles win, although he has been banned from Eagles Stadium.  Not only is Pat (the lead character) struggling with his own mental issues, but he meets Tiffany who, since her husbands death which she blames herself for, also out of her mind.  The two connect at dinner one night when she asks him what meds he is on and they enjoy talking about the side effects of various antidepressants and other meds that they have been on.  The sparks fly between these two and the witty dialogue and emotional turmoil between them make the movie.  Yes, it is a love story and there is something about ballroom dancing in it, but it is also about football and gambling and mental illness and crazy families.  It is an emotionally absorbing movie that tenderly takes apart the emotions and lives of Pat and Tiffany.  Well worth watching.",1411430400,,1867,4.746130030959752
5172557,4,B008OGIPJA,"3.5 stars.  I love Bradley Cooper and his performance was awesome.  Actually all the acting was incredible.  My only problem is this is not a comedy.  There are a few humorous scenes for sure, but no laugh out loud parts.  It is a romantic drama-not a romantic comedy.  There is a lot of sadness and tension as the two main characters try to rebuild their shattered lives while coping with mental illness.  The families of both are trying to help and stumble their way through as they search for a way to get them to meet their potential.  So, superb acting, good drama, slow and at times tense story with an awesome ending!  Glad I rented it",1411344000,,642,4.418803418803419

5172560,5,B008OGIPJA,"Original and humorous drama starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro.  Director David O. Russell successfully straddles different story genres by constructing a heartfelt drama about mental illness, acceptance, family love, and mutual attraction.  In much the same way MASH straddled comedy and drama on television, Silver Linings Playbook provides believable and unflinching insights to mental illness and the capacity of love to ameliorate those afflictions.  While Playbook doesn't obsess about bipolar disorder or related disorders it's clearly the elephant in the room for every scene involving Pat (Cooper).  He accepts his diagnosis, tries to defeat it without drugs, and stubbornly attends support groups.

With an abundance of well-drawn and sympathetic characters Playbook is not only extremely well written but manages to avoid becoming cloying or maudlin through sharp writing, spot-on acting, and skillful (if a bit intrusive) direction.  The story, writing, acting and pacing are far too good to allow Russell's tendency for the unnecessary special effect to ruin the show.  Cooper and Lawrence are amazing in their ability to channel both bombast and studied silence in the course of a single conversation.  DeNiro is a nuanced treasure as Pat's long suffering, OCD father.

The extended diner scene with Pat and Tiffany is one of the best onscreen conversations between two people I've ever seen.  A gem of a movie, complete with an organic, uplifting conclusion.  Which surprisingly, fits this film like a glove.",1411344000,,1549,5.521186440677966

With the book, I couldn't put it down because there was so much mystery and the characters were so interesting. With the movie, there is no mystery because everything is bluntly revealed to the audience early on and most of the characters were drastically changed. I was upset with the movie because it changed so much with what I loved about the book. I thought Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) was truest to her character, and I was thankful for that. Pat (Bradley Cooper) was close to the original. Even though my review sounds like I wouldn't recommend the movie, I would. It is a good movie when not compared to the book.

Love, comedy, sports, friendship, difficult personal and family relationships---and great acting.  Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing.  She commands the screen with her great presence and has a maturity and power seemingly way beyond her years.  She is funny, strong and vulnerable all at the same time.  Bradley Cooper made me believe that he really was unstable, but his was a less showy part for sure.  And, as his parents, Jacki Weaver was this warm and wonderful mother, while Robert De Niro found another completely different screen character to inhabit and perfectly once again.  Also not to be forgotten was Chris Tucker, who was a revelation as Bradley Cooper's mental institution buddy, and a great dance teacher.",1404000000,,825,4.970802919708029

Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in her Oscar-winning role, and Bradley Cooper proves that he can kind of act. As far as the romantic aspects of the story...eh.

Once all is said and done, there are some seriously corny and cliched moments throughout though. And the film's superficial examination of mental health is very trite and simplistic.

5172832,4,B008OGIPJA,"Directed by David O. Russell, Silver Linings Playbook is a comedy that can be watched with the whole family. Pat Solatano, starring Bradley Cooper has just been released from an institute due to his way of solving problems with his wifes new lover. Pat a former teacher has lost everything and wants to gain back everything especially the relation with his wife. Currently living with his parents, a football fanatic father and a much loving mother, Pat meets Tiffany starring Jennifer Lawrence at his friends dinner. They both exchange a few harsh words over dinner but while the movie grows, they both become each others guidance and a sense of support. Tiffany makes Pat join a dance competition with her in return of helping Pat get together with his ex-wife. While leading up the dance competition, there are rises and falls amongst the characters. The movie is conflicts and resolutions with a comedic relief. Silver Linings Playbook was a strong movie with many awards. There were strengths to this movie as well as weaknesses, just like any other movie. The number one strength to this movie is starring Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. Not only was she a fantastic ego filled moody widow. She took up the role and displayed exactly how a widow could act like after someone who she loves is snatched away from her.  A weakness that this movie had was starring Bradley Cooper as Pat. Pats character is a strong character that in times has comedic lines that have to be presented in such a way that it should seem normal. Cooper in a way was awkward in this character role. Coopers personality hadnt quite fit the broken to pieces Pat character that this movie was built around. Another strength about this movie is considering the wardrobe of Tiffanys. Having Tiffany wear dark colors the whole movie, showing her mourning and being dark. Showing the mysteriousness of her character within the movie, until the end. At the dance competition Tiffanys wardrobe changes, shes shown to wear white. White symbolizes purity and new beginnings. This change shows that Tiffany has finally gotten over her past, moved on. The white she wears at the competition is the changing point in Tiffanys life of finally starting something new in her life. This white shows the love she has grown for the new people around her. Another strength this film is the fact of having very strong personality based minor characters within the movie. This made the movie not only interesting but it gives the major characters a reliance on these minor characters. These minor characters each tell a different story, making the film better than what it already is.",1399939200,,2639,4.877505567928731
5172833,3,B008OGIPJA,"David O. Russells Silver Linings Playbook was a decent movie, I didn't understand the very high reviews it got, but nonetheless it was an entertaining movie with superb acting and tackles a topic that many directors would shy away from.
 After watching Silver Linings Playbook you realize that the whole movie centers around mental dieses and the hardships it can put on the individual and everyone around them. The portrayal of bi-polar disease and OCD are fantastic in this movie, but the characters chemistry was lacking which makes me think the casting crew just threw 3 blockbuster actors together just because they were all good actors and it would make the film more popular.
 The movies begins with Bradley Coopers Pat Solitano just getting out of a Baltimore mental institute for beating a man half to death after catching him and his wife in the shower together. Pat has Bi-polar disorder and often acts inappropriate, irrational, and impulsive. Pat is under the impression (delusion) that his wife and him are still in love even though she placed a restraining order against him. Cooper plays this part very well and you can tell that he has done his homework on bi-polar.
 After a few nights living with his parents Pat ends up getting into a fist fight with dad Robert De Niro and is still refusing to take his bi-polar meds. In many scenes throughout the movie Bradley Cooper got the acting spot on for his role, with mood swings and explosions.
 Later on Pat meets a young emotionally damaged widow named Tiffany at a friends dinner party. This is where I start having problems with the movie. Jennifer Lawrence who plays Tiffany is a good actor but lacks chemistry with Bradley cooper. There is attraction between these two but thats about as far as it goes. After many times of ambushing Pat on his jogs, Tiffany and Pat make a deal which goes something like this: Ill help smuggle letters to your wife who has a restraining order against you if you help me with a dance competition.
 While all of this is going on Pats dad who recently lost his job is making large bets on Eagles football games and believes if Pat watches the game it will help his juju(juju is a Gypsie word for luck). Robert De Niro plays Pat Solitano Sr. who has OCD, and portrays it almost as well as Cooper portrays bi-polar disorder.
 Tiffany convinces Pats dad to put all of his money on the Eagles vs. Cowboys game that he would otherwise buy a family restaurant with. This part of the movie I had the biggest problem with. Tiffany is potentially bankrupting Pats family after convincing Pats dad of false superstitions and telling him to parlor with the bookie and bet all of the money on the game and also if thats not enough, Pat and Tiffany have to get a 5.0 or better at the dance competition. Tiffany says she doesnt believe in that s*** when talking about the juju but puts a family at risk just to force Pat to do the dance competition.
 Nearing the end, the movie gets more and more predictable. The further and further into the movie you go it seems like Pat is cured of his bi-polar because he shows almost no signs of it.
The movie starts out good but then turns into that predictable story of: guy finds girl, they break up, they get back together, and everything ends up great, then credits. If you want a movie that you don't already know the ending to watch a Tarintino or Scorsese film, otherwise youll miss out on the directing side of things but will still have a good movie.
Though I felt like there was too little music, the music I did hear was excellent. Costume and set design were nothing special but Russell made up for it the well done comedic aura of the whole film. I would definitely not watch this a second time however, the first time proved to be decent enough where I still felt it wasn't a waste of time.",1399939200,,3832,4.536903039073806
5172834,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic comedy that shows us that there is a silver lining everywhere and you just have to be brave enough to go after it. In the film we are introduced to Pat played by Bradley cooper who admits to finding his silver lining. Then there is Tiffany played by Jennifer Lawrence who is a widow with a particular way of living. The two needing each others help will start a bond but where will it lead.
  One of the strengths in the film is the setting. With this suburban setting in Philadelphia, so much is accomplished for the storyline.  One of the great scenes that accomplish this is at the start of the film. This is when a high school boy tries to interview Pat. This really helps show us that the community is not used to being around someone like Pat who is bipolar and was just released from a mental institute. The idea of just adding this little piece to the film really captures the emotions. Another scene that really shows us how setting plays a big part in what made this movie so great is when Tiffany is hinted at by a cop to go out some time to get intimate due to Tiffanies history. This really shows how the setting is involved with how everyone knows what everyones past was like.
  A weakness in the film is the ending. At the ending scene we see that Pat goes after Tiffany to tell her he loves her and she just so happens to accept. This scene is a vary predictable scene to just about anyone. It might pull the story together with Pat finding his silver lining but it could have been done in better way. Another part of the ending was how Pats father played by Robert De Niro wins both bets he made. One being that his football team wins and anther that Pat and Tiffany score a five in that dance competition. Not only do Tiffany and Pat win their part in the bet but also they just so happen to average out with exactly a five.
  A secondary strength in the film is the casting. With so many important characters in the film it becomes difficulty to get everything just right. This problem is not the case for Silver Linings Playbook thought. When we see Pats mother played by Jacki Weaver we can feel a mothers concern for her son as the viewer. The emotions come out in the scene after when a bet is made between Pats father and Randy played by Paul Herman. In this part we see how the thought of lying to her Son, Pat, really kills her even thought its for the best, not only do we get touched by a mothers love for her son but also a fathers love. We can see a mind-boggling relationship between Pat and his father but that all comes together at the end of the dance competition. At the end we can see that Pats father really wants what is best for his son and to do so he tells him to go after his one an only silver lining, Tiffany.
  Lastly there is the one strength that really makes this movie what it is, the love connection that is formed.  From the crazy backgrounds of the charters to the outrages outbursts in the movie the love connection that is formed is one of the most important parts that really tie every thing together. The crazy love connection between Pat and Tiffany is one of an original. From finding his wife cheating on him with a former coworker to their wedding song is a bit of a blow. As for Tiffany to become a widow at such an early age is as well but as well as having an intimate relationship with every co-worker is a shocker.  These two are able to come together with a connection like no other. The way tiffany is able to comfort Pat and how Pat can handle all of Tiffanies loose screws. This new crazy type of love is just what the film needs to show that there really is a silver lining.
  All in all with so many aspects to look at in a one movie there is no denying how great the film is. To the craziness in the characters to the funny comments and superstations is really what makes this movie a hit.  No one will be able to leave their seats. Silver Linings is really the way to go.",1399766400,,3983,4.203145478374836

I was under the impression (I apparently should have done more research, but wanted to avoid spoilers) that this movie was going to be more of a feel-good, romantic comedy. IT ISN'T. If you are looking for that, look elsewhere.

I can't say that this movie is bad, but it definitely was not what I was expecting and wasn't the type of movie I enjoy. The acting is good to great and the story/meaning is sincere and well interpreted. However, I would classify this more as a emotional roller-coaster that has more of a depressing feeling about it. That isn't giving anything away...I am simply describing the tone of the movie in general.

So, I personally don't recommend this movie, but it is well done for what it is.",1399507200,,894,4.341317365269461

5172862,4,B008OGIPJA,"Overall, every person is a little messed up mentally. Knowing some people have more severe conditions than others, deep down we know theres something odd about each of us.  This is what makes Silver Linings Playbook, movie from director David O. Russell such an awesome film. The main character Pat, (Bradley Cooper) is diagnosed with bipolar disorder while locked up after an attack against his wifes lover. Not listening to medical advice, Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver), Pat Jrs caring mother, releases him from the institution without telling Pat Sir (Robert DeNiro), who has a Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD.  Pats recovery and the support he gets from his loved ones only shows that none of us are anything near to what could be described as normal. After Pat is released from the institution he tries and tries to get in contact with his ex  wife, who has a restraining order against him after the attack. Pat ends up meeting a girl named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who helps him get a letter to his ex-wife which explains his love for her, which he ends up realizing his ex-wife does not deserve the letter, a different girl does. This movie will make you feel several different emotions as well as keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next!
The story is about a former teacher named Pat who is released from an institution after an eight month stay and tries to win back his cheating wife. Pat Jr is supposed to be taking his medication for his condition, but refuses to, since he believes he can manage by living healthy and finding the silver linings in his life.  One of the strengths of this film is that the plot almost fades away in your head as you watch the awesome characters that play a role in Pats life. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who meets Pat after he moves back home, is a recently widowed, young, and crazy woman who coped with her feelings by having sex with every person in her office. She states I was a slut. There will always be a part of me that is dirty and sloppy, but I like that, just like all the other parts of myself. The audience can see that she is a very hurt girl who is lost, and does not know what to do in the situation she had to face alone. She does stick up for herself about the mistakes she made of becoming a slut. Jennifer Lawrence plays this role very well, making her audience feel the emotions she feels throughout the movie. When Pat and Tiffany meet, they both think the other is crazy and weird, but eventually realize they need each other to help cope with their losses.  Throughout this romantic comedy you will see the crazy duo laugh, fight verbally, and even dance their problems away. Yes, I said dance! Now lets go back to Pat Sir.

Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), Pat Jrs father, is not just an obsessive Philadelphia Eagles fan, but also a compulsive gambler with OCD tendencies. A second strength about this film is that Pat Sir is also crazy like his son. Usually a romantic movie is about the family being picture perfect, but not in this film!  Pat Sir tells Pat Jr Where have you been? Huh? We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that. We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have any chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you...do you realize that? The audience can see that Pat Sirs OCD is kicking in about Pat Jr watching the game with him, which Pat Sir thinks will help the Eagles win. Since both of them have issues, this causes several father/son arguments throughout the movie.  These arguments are not healthy for any father/ son relationship but when you see Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper playing this role so well, you are forced to laugh at their hilarious actions throughout the film.

The entire movie has a perfect cast. While Bradley Cooper is the films best surprise while revealing his characters crazy episodes with just the panic, fear, and stress without ever overplaying his role. Robert De Niro is awesome, but its Jennifer Lawrences role that you will be talking about after you watch the movie. Tiffany is almost as messed up as Pat, and this young actress plays her role with an appealing hostility that lets her over power every scene shes in. Shes the fourth grade bully who punches you in the arm and tells you to stop being such a wimp, and though you may be in pain and have your feelings crushed you still cant help the crush you have on her. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this film if you like romance and also if you love to laugh.",1398124800,,4532,4.5036496350364965

This was like a train wreck - you know that you don't want to see it but are compelled to look.

I also loved the way that it touches on several different mental illness, and gives an honest portrayal of them. Of course, mental illness is a serious topic; but the movie does a great job at making it seem a little lighter, and brings to light the fact that so many people are working through a form of mental illness or some sort of emotional problems of their own.",1395619200,,803,4.395973154362416

It's intelligent, without being predictable or stereotyped.  Given the amount of mediocre material out there these days, on that basis alone it should get (5) stars.  Jennifer Lawrence (who is VERY hot in this movie) and Cooper do a masterful job with a wonderful, truly hilarious screenplay.  My 'acid test' for a really great movie is how many times I watch it after the first viewing (and I have hundred's of DVD's sitting on my shelves I've seen only once)--I've watched this at least a dozen times and  always see something new and interesting each time.

The unexpected twists of this movie keep your attention and makes you really understand how somebodys life can be changed by one simple event.
 David O. Russells Silver Linings Playbook is a funny drama with a hidden romance between Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who have both recently been through life changing events that has lead them to need each other to make their life goals come true. The movie starts out with Pat being taken out of the psychiatric hospital newly diagnosed with bipolar disease. He was put in there because he beat up the older teacher he caught sleeping with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee). Now free, Pat tries to get in touch with his wife and show her he has made progress in his well-being. In the process Pat meets Tiffany through friends. Tiffany is dealing with her own problems, her husband was killed and dealing with her loss, she makes some foolish decisions with other men. Tiffany, knowing Nikki, is asked by pat to deliver a letter. Tiffany agrees but only if Pat dances in a competition that shes always wanted to be in. While Pat is home, he is living with his parents making things a little more stressful. Pats dad (Robert De Niro) has an obsession with the Philadelphia eagles. He believes in good luck and part of that is Pat needs to watch the games with his dad. But now with Tiffany in the picture, his time is spent with her and when a family fight breaks out about the family luck, Tiffany and the family make a bet that if they get a certain score on competition day that also happens to be one of the biggest Eagles game, that they can win big money. In the mist of all of this, they develop an odd relationship that ends in the two falling in love and realizing there is always a silver lining, or brighter side, to things.
 Silver Linings Playbook has many strengths and weaknesses. One of the strengths of the movie in my opinion is how David O Russell makes this movie relatable to the life of everyday people. For example, many people can relate to Pat and Tiffanys losses and mental illnesses. They both loose a person close to them in a physical and mental aspect. Also, Pats family life at home is a great way for the audience to relate to because Pat is an older man living at home, and in this decade that is common. Their Family argues like a regular family and the family shows appreciation for their family traditions.
 Another strength of this one of a kind movie is the relationship between Tiffany and Pat. They are both special individuals with very strong personalities. When they first meet, their personalities go head to head with each other and they develop an odd, friendly relationship. What gives this movie originality compared to other romantic films is that the two totally different individuals don't try to impress each other nor do they give off any lovey dovey feelings. They create a love that is real and not sugar coated with lies about themselves that would make them like each other. The movie doesnt give off a regular romantic feeling but a romantic feeling with a twist.
 Although the film has many strengths that make this movie an original, there are also many weaknesses. One of the more obvious weaknesses is the casting of the actors. Pat, played by Bradley Cooper, Is portrayed as a bipolar, lost man. Bradley Coopers look and attitude towards the film is great but throughout the movie I believed his acting could have been done better by a different actor. His presence doesnt give off the feel of a broken man finding his way that I believe the film was trying to portray.
 Too add on, another weakness of this movie would have to be how easy it was to predict the ending. In the beginning and middle of the movie, they focus on the problems pat faces and how he tries to use Tiffany to his advantage making the movie unpredictable to what was going happen. It left you questioning if Pat was going to follow through with the dance and how Nikki was going to react. But towards the end, the family gets into an argument that leads to arranging a deal to go down on the night of the competition. Adding in that argument so late in the film, pretty much in my opinion ruins the unpredictable feeling the movie gives off. It is just too easy to predict that they will win the bet and that Tiffany and Pats love will heat up.
 All in all, the film was an original, no movie can be compared to Silver Linings Playbook. I recommend this film to anybody that wants to watch a movie that is filled with humor and romantic twists. The movie will leave you feeling happy to know that there is always something good that can come out of a bad situation.",1395273600,,4817,4.518348623853211
5172898,5,B008OGIPJA,This is one of my top 5 movies of all time.  Jennifer Lawrence is a dream come true.  She deserves an Oscar for any role she plays.  An absolute wonderful and talented actress.  She sinks herself in her roles and assumes that persons identity.  Hunger Games ranks near the top also.  I've seen Silver Linings Playbook several times and it's like watching it for the first time.  It captivates and resounds.  The music is right on also.,1395187200,,435,4.558441558441558

5172901,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is my new favorite romantic-comedy.  I know, it isn't really supposed to be a rom-com, but since this movie pretty much has it all it can be anything you want it to be.  What I particularly love about this movie is that the moments of sadness do not overwhelm the rest of the plot.  It is a movie where the motto is Excelsior and every scene of this movie exemplifies that.

While I'm sure many go to see movies like Black Swan and Girl, Interrupted believing that is what mental illness is all about as a person who has struggled those movies mean nothing to me.  Instead this shows a better pantheon of emotions about how society deals with those who have mental illness than either of those movies(and I understand Girl, Interrupted is about a memoir but that doesn't make it realistic). In fact the plot is so poignant about what it feels like to have the stigma of mental illness with you out in the world that it is clear this film was personal to the director/screenwriter.
The acting is astounding, with Jenifer Lawrence shining like a diamond. Yet Lawrence doesn't overshadow anyone, Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver all bring their A game.  It is truly an ensemble cast movie.

5172911,5,B008OGIPJA,"Two of the most prominent themes of this film are: people diagnosed with some ""mental illnesses"" actually are fully in touch with reality. The problems which flow from this understanding -- especially, bipolar and other mood disorders is that these people have to deal with the life as given. Then, the universal conundrum of being afraid to be in love -- hence commitment makes us all vulnerable.

""Normal"" folks can adjust far more easily and successfully as they use denial to circumvent the tragic realities of life which we all have to face. Being bipolar or having clinical depression puts one far more in contact with our existence. As belief in organized religions or using forms of denial by identifying with ""the norm"" can isolate us from the truth -- and ease our adjustment.

As a psychologist, this depiction of bipolar illness is the most accurate and nuanced version which I have ever seen. Pat and Tiffany both suffer from this DSM diagnostic category. These mood disorders are closely related to obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep problems, eating disorder, borderline and other personality disorders... So, Pat's father [Pat, Sr.] clearly has obsessive compulsive disorder and, consequently many superstitions which interfere with his functioning. Since genetics are involved -- why not?

These themes are not new to me -- however, it is the execution of Silver Linings Playbook by director Russell and the engaging cast, the cinemaphotography. original and selected music that makes this film so outstanding. Add The two most prominent characters and Robert de Nero... Who is possibly the most ""crazy"" --  simply because he does not acknowledge his obsessive problem.

Someone said that this is a comedy. Yes and no! It is quite serious dealing with tragic existential problems... But, is not comedy often the other side of tragedy?

Yes, Silver Linings Playbook does deal with the great magnitude of suffering which both Pat and Tiffany have to deal with -- however this work presents it in an aesthetically pleasing and often delightful manner.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Linings-Playbook/dp/B00A81MV3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Linings Playbook</a>",1394409600,2,2229,5.541176470588235

We all go through stuff, and this movie is a great reminder that we can get through our problems and cope better when we take care of ourselves and build our relationships in a healthy way.

He hopes to reunite with her but he hates taking his meds and he realizes that he needs therapy.  Tiffany is a young, troubled widow who wants to enter a Philadelphia dance competition (do we need to say more?).  She persuades Pat to be her partner in return for her serving as the go-between between him and his ex-wife Nikki.

Pats dad, Pat Sr., wants to open a restaurant and hes ready to bet everything on an Eagles game to obtain the money to do it.  Unfortunately, hes been banned from the Eagles stadium for fighting and general rowdiness, but he can drive into the tailgating lot.  His betting adversary suggests a parlaydouble or nothing if the Eagles beat the Cowboys and if Pat and Tiffany score an average of 5.0 or higher from the tough-house dance judges.

Last minute development: Nikki shows up at the competition.  Will this put a crimp in the burgeoning relationship between Pat and Tiffany and ruin Pat Sr.s chances to rebuild his life?

Some have suggested that Silver Linings Playbook is a genre-bending, unique film: dark, light, sweet, snarky, tear-filled, hilarious.  In some ways thats true, but from another perspective its a montage of scenes from wonderful but vastly-different films.  Think of it this way: take a bag and put in some pieces from the old chestnut, David and Lisa (1962).  Add a cup or two from Patton Oswalts tale of a crazed Giants supporter, Big Fan (2009).  Finally, add a handful of sweets from Baz Luhrmanns stunning and delightful, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

Dramatizing mental illness has always been a tricky proposition for the movies. How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi-layered condition.

In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.

But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight.",1394236800,,2816,4.659959758551308

5172924,5,B008OGIPJA,"James L. Brooks' Academy Award winner may not always be easy to watch, but never fails to be worthwhile in its portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunctionality.  We spend the entire film wondering if Bradley Cooper's character will ever find that ""silver lining"" in life, and just waiting for him to ruin any opportunity create a relationship with Jennifer Lawrence and to find a way to mend his relationship with his dad, Robert deNiro.  Brooks arrays a variety of colorful characters for us to laugh and suffer with as we watch two generations of Philadelphians find their way through life's potholes.  But in the end, we are uplifted -- as teeteringly as Cooper lifts Lawrence in the dance number -- but uplifted nonetheless.  Under Brooks' deft directing, each character seems to mesh with the others, and everything somehow fits together for the best.  I found the portrayal of Cooper's psychiatrist to be truly unusual compared with the usual arm-s length relationship between patient and client.  Cooper's love and appreciation for the ""curry-eaters"" flies in the face of typical prejudicial views of dark-skinned foreigners, as the film uses the universal love of sports to prove how little people's ethnic differences really matter.  Cooper is always on the verge of flying into uncontrolled rages over the loss of his wife, and you wonder until the very end of the film whether he can get this part of his life under control.  In the extras, director Brooks talks about mental health problems with his own son, and how they became a inspiration for this movie.  This is a great film to share with friends and family members who have faced emotional problems because it shows both the harsh reality of such issues and the possibilities for finding that ""silver lining.""

Anupam Kher was also excellent as Dr. Patel.  The pacing was excellent, and helped to make the theme easier to take, and it isn't an easy theme.  In many ways, the entire film is in the form of variations on therapy.  The main character is bipolar, and authentically resists taking lithium.  Dramatic scenes between Cooper and Lawrence often resemble  breakthroughs in therapy.  Pat Jr's father played by De Niro seems to have similar issues, and bipolarity tends to run in families. One of the twists that I especially like about this film is that it follows the form of a typical sports-based film, but the final ""game"" isn't football or baseball.  Lawrence as Tiffany is sharp and quick, and a perfect complement to Cooper's often hypomanic Pat The film has intensity and heart, and a moving ending.

Also unlikely that she'd be able to run off all of these sports scores off the top of her head.

5172948,1,B008OGIPJA,"My ex forced me to sit through this torture chamber multiple times- I would have rather been water boarded- to call the writer a self indulgent untalented pretentious hack would not even begin to describe how absolutely awful this is. The writing sucks, what liitle there is, there characters, and I use that term loosely because there are none are just random - I guess he smoked a lot of pot while penning this absolute tar baby. There is no way in hell any movie with Bradley Cooper will ever be worth watching- he is the worst hack ever. As for Jennifer Lawrence, since I will likely never get to date her I have to judge not on looks but body of work and frankly it sucks- being in hunger games is like being in friday the 13th. She reminds me of the most untalented actress in the history of the world, jennifer aniston, and that pretty much sums it up. Deniro sucked and made a fool of himself in this farce, obviously he is hard up for cash or attention. You would do better drinking draino than sitting through 5 minutes of this schizo suck fest.",1393718400,6,1055,4.3604060913705585

5172959,5,B008OGIPJA,I loved this movie. I love movies but it is rare that I watch them more than once. Silver Linings Playbook is one that I could watch over and over. This movie is raw.

5172969,2,B008OGIPJA,I wasn't impressed with the acting of Jennifer Lawrence.  Having seen her in other movies I think she really is just playing herself and really how hard is that?  Bradley Coopers character was somewhat interesting.  But it seemed as if whoever wrote the screenplay didn't know how to take the book and make it an interesting movie with well developed characters.  The movie strays pretty far from the book and it doesn't make the story better it just makes it stupid and disjointed and unbelievable.  I expected so much more after hearing so many good things about the movie.  What a disappointment.  I won't say don't waste your time but it's best if you watch it for free on cable on a day when you have nothing else to do.,1392595200,2,725,4.530769230769231

5172974,5,B008OGIPJA,"Director David O. Russell should be given props, for he turned Matthew Quick's 2008 novel into a compelling film of raw emotion, humor, and sagacity. Playing off of the idea of optimism and incorporating the uplifting mantra, ""Excelsior,"" a Latin word meaning forever upward, Russell succeeds at molding a serious, dark storyline into one of romance and wit.

Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) faced 8 months in a psych ward after taking a ride on an emotional rollercoaster, prompted by the sight of his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), making love to another man. He lost everything: his wife, his credibility, his job. Faced with bi-polar disorder, Pat struggles to piece his life back together, optimism leading him the entire way. As he states, ""I'm gonna take this negativity and I'm gonna use it as fuel, I'm gonna find a silver lining."" And who better to help him than Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a crazy, depressed widow who shares the same struggles and likes as Pat. Together they face their emotional and unruly pasts as their friendship develops into something even more cherished.

Silver Linings Playbook came to life thanks to the superb characterization that grasped the audiences' attention. For who could play the roles of a depressed woman and bi-polar man better than Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, with their impressive use of physicality and delivery, enriched with heartfelt emotion. Lawrence, known for her impeccable performance in The Hunger Games, transforms from a rebel child of bow-and-arrow skills, to a beautiful sophisticated woman wielding a monotonous, almost emotionally impenetrable appearance. Cooper, with nervous habits of wringing his hands and flitting his eyes back and forth, portrays just how unstable he is, especially as he throws his copy of A Farewell to Arms out the window and laboriously complains to his parents about the awful ending Hemmingway had conceived. Their irrational arguments, manic laughs, and hysterical yelling show just how crazy they truly are. It's believable and meaningful at the same time. Their performances fit their roles to a tee.

The cohesion and pace of this film keeps its viewers on their toes. To take the grim idea of mental illness and incorporate love, comedy, and sorrow into one movie is a difficult task, one that Russell dominated. The emotional balance and structure of the film allowed the storyline to come full circle. Tiffany and Pat began as two struggling souls, but with optimism and support, they found their silver linings as well as a true love they had thought to be lost forever.

If you are looking for a film that will put you in awe, Silver Linings Playbook is the movie for you. It's a meaningful film, handled with precision and care, molded to encapsulate the audiences' attention. And the success is owed to director Russell for his impressive interpretation of the storyline. We also owe the superb cast a round of applause for being one of the best ensembles ever filmed. Just remember that in times of need, of struggle, or of sorrow, there can always be found a silver lining. May ""Excelsior"" forever be our mantra.",1392508800,3,3134,5.044401544401544

However, Jennifer Lawrence's acting is amazing and makes the movie worth seeing.
Other than that the whole story seems too artificial...maybe reading the book before seeing the movie helps?",1392422400,,398,5.138461538461539

5172993,2,B008OGIPJA,"I, on the other hand, did not.
I enjoyed the romance and dialog between the two main characters, but the rest of the film was a mess.
Most of the story was slow and boring with uneven pacing and uninteresting supporting characters.
What the fudge was Chris Tucker even doing in this movie?!? You would expect all his scenes to be funny and crazy, but they were all bland, awkward and unnecessary.

I would consider this a ""chick flick"", something you just take your girl to, to make/keep her happy.  I apologize that I'm unable to describe, sufficiently, why I don't like it.  It's more of overall gut feeling.  If I had to, I might attribute it to the ratio of characters discussing their emotions and feelings over the number of scenes where anything interesting happened.

Really an unpleasant experience all the yelling, stupid stuff.  I think it took about 5 minutes to get the message the main guy AND his dad are both totally nuts, didn't have to repeat the message over and over and over and over.  They may all have come out as new perfect personalities in the end, but we couldn't stand it. Gave it 1 hour and pulled the plug.  Best actress? Why?

5173018,5,B008OGIPJA,"I loved this movie. First off the movie is fun, and the characters act out in unexpected ways which keep the movie exciting.  The movie using supportive parents, and an old fashioned neighborhood is able to position them all to project the message that given time, and support one can heal from depression if like the characters you take your meds and find an activity that lets you express yourself like dance and sex. That is the good news and it is only too bad that most people in our transient society of hot guys and girls are looking for jobs that actually pay.

However, it should be noted that these kinds of situations do not always have ""happy"" endings.  But, we should all be aware that there are all kinds of people out there, and most with serious issues going on.  We should not judge anyone.  But, instead, treat everyone the same -  with kindness and respect.  We can make a difference.",1391126400,,497,4.4222222222222225
5173022,4,B008OGIPJA,"There are already tons of reviews that go into how great the cast is especially J. Lawrence, so I'll just get into what bothered me.  Basically the whole story that drives these people together is weird and seems haphazard.  J. Lawrence plays a young woman who is recently widowed.  Cooper plays a man who lost his marriage to his spouse for more complicated reasons.  His wife refuses to speak to him and he spends a great deal of his energy trying to get her back.  J. Lawrence takes an immediate liking to him... and then falls in love with him almost as quickly.  We don't really get to see it happen because it's strange that she would grow so ridiculously attached to someone she doesn't even know.  At first it just seems to be a grieving soul who is looking to heal with someone- anyone.. but soon after that she apparently falls in love with him barely having known him and the audience hardly gets any warning at all.  His feelings for her are slower and therefore easier to digest.  We can see him falling in love with her throughout the film.  The focus on the father's gambling problems is also strange.  It's almost distracting because it's overdone.  So it's the writing that I have the problem with overall.  I've read some reviews that complain this movie is nothing like the book it's based on and perhaps that's where the problems lie, but I haven't read the book so to me the script just comes off as.... well... off.

5173052,3,B008OGIPJA,"I have no qualms with Jennifer Lawrence - if she's ever had an Oscar worthy performance it should have been for her part in Winter's Bone - now that was impressive.  I fail to see how her character in Silver Linings Playbook had such a range that has people falling all over themselves to say she deserved an Oscar.  She had a couple of breakdowns (always good for getting some kind of award) but nothing truly moving.  If anything, Bradley Cooper, was pulling on my heartstrings because his illness often left him so blithely pathetic and sad.  I feel like HE had more work to do in this movie than she did. Eh.  I'll get over it.
I guess I was ruined by all of the hype surrounding this movie.  I was expecting more - instead I just thought the premise was strange and kind of hard to buy.  Fine, he's a bipolar that wants to get back together with his wife and she cheated on him.  So he needs to give her a letter but the only way he can get that letter to her is if he agrees to dance in a competition with Tiffany and to keep his ass in line there's this ridiculous bet that his father (DeNiro was moving in this) made so he HAS to do it.  OK?  Sure, why not.  Let's do that.

Not exactly the ""I've been waiting all my life for this movie!"" reaction I was expecting to get but it passed the time.",1390435200,2,1302,4.102766798418973

5173059,4,B008OGIPJA,"I heard a lot of talk when the movie came out and remembered none of it, just that it was a movie many had watched.

Despite the ""Hollywood"" ending and a degree of predictability, the acting was spectacular!!! I would never have thought Bradley Cooper could bring the depth he did and be on point with the uncomfortable humor surrounding mental health issues. DeNiro and Lawrence deliver incredibly, but that's no surprise. I would not have been able to like or connect with Lawrence's character if any other actress had played the role.

I respect the lower rated reviews I've read here. They all make perfect sense. The movie touches a lot of buttons, so don't expect an education on mental health problems...the point seems more that whether one carries a diagnosis or not, we're all broken (at least a little). Some are better at hiding it than others, while some could care less about bothering to show the world a different ""face.""

The characters (Cooper and Lawrence) knew who they were, why they made the bad choices they did and that they wanted to make different choices going forward (also knowing the future would hold new mistakes). That sort of awareness is rare and seldom elevated when it's wrapped in people who appear so damaged.

The gambling was difficult to appreciate, but was most certainly a symptom of a family pathology and how we come to accept norms within our families that others would consider bizarre.

What I found most interesting while watching it was that I felt a little like a voyeur at times...that I shouldn't be privy to what was happening. Movies don't often put me in that space, so that was pretty great.

We don't need to be around perfect people to heal or live differently. Perfect people don't exist. This movie drives home that new connections and courage to be vulnerable can exponentially deepen very worthwhile growth.",1390176000,2,1871,4.795031055900621
5173060,5,B008OGIPJA,"When Pat Solitano Jr. gets discharged from a court ordered stay in a mental hospital, the only thing on his mind is to reunite with his wife Nikki, who has a restraining order on him for beating up her lover. The audience is treated to a roller coaster ride of emotional pitfalls and obstacles during Pat's recovery. Pat, determined to show his wife he is a changed man, tells his therapist he doesn't need medication and chooses instead to maintain a positive state of mind and look for the ""silver linings.""

It isn't long before the viewer understands the scope of Pat's issues during his melt downs and violent reactions every time he hears his wedding song, (Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"") among other triggers. Tiffany Maxwell, a recent widow with issues of her own, meets Pat at his friend's house and sparks fly between them. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have real chemistry and the audience is immediately smitten with these two misfits. Aside from sharing the same kinds of medications, Pat and Tiffany seem to understand each other. Pat sees a means to communicate to Nikki through Tiffany and she promises to give Nikki (her sister's best friend) a letter from Pat, but in exchange he must be her dance partner in a competition.

Complications arise with Pat's father bets on a Philadelphia Eagles game, money he's been saving to open a restaurant. His OCD and unusual superstitions lead to some very funny scenes. As a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan he is convinced his son, who has been rehearsing with Tiffany instead of attending games is causing the Philadelphia Eagles to lose. This leads to one of the best scenes and major turning points in the film when Tiffany having been stood up, confronts Pat at his house. The outburst is hilarious and powerful to watch. The stakes go up when Pat's father raises the bet and uses his son's dance competition score as a parlay to win back his money. Now everything rides on the dance competition and Pat feeling the pressure, refuses to compete.

This movie offers an unusual love story supported by a very strong cast. Bradley Cooper was the biggest surprise for me. Having seen him previously in comedies like ""Hangover,"" Cooper gives an outstanding performance and proves he has the acting range to tackle complex difficult roles. David O.Russell's adapted screenplay based on the novel by Matthew Quick also does a great job as director of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and garnered two Academy award nominations. Russell was originally attracted to the project because his own son suffers from a bipolar disorder and OCD,issues addressed in the movie. Russell brings sensitivity and strikes a balance with the characters and their neurosis in the film. All four lead actors including Robert Deniro, (as Pat's dad) earned Academy Award nominations. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, gives a sassy multi-layer touchdown performance and won the Oscar for best actress.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is worth watching! Combined, with a marvelous Soundtrack by Danny Elfman,""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a terrific movie that scores big!",1390176000,,3098,5.023346303501945

5173062,3,B008OGIPJA,"It was a so so movie, not great. I kind of liked the story line and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence was in it, her character is dealing with issues just like Bradley's character is. Both for different reasons of course. The deal is she does something for him and in return he has to be her dance partner for this competition. He's still obsessing over his ex wife after he gets out of a mental hospital. He's desperate to get back with her and just to have some kind of contact with her again. He uses Lawrence to try to get to her because her sister is friends with Bradley's ex. It's very predictable and I guess I thought based on the trailer it would be much funnier than it really was. I recommend waiting until you can buy it at a lower price. I bought it for $14.99 and I regret it so bad.

5173065,4,B008OGIPJA,"Let me admit I loved this film, but my wife was slightly less enthusiastic when we watched it together. She had issues with the male protagonist , Pat"" Solitano, Jr., a guy with bipolar disorder who is released from a psychiatric hospital and moves back in with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver).  Suffice to say that the character's bouts of acting out and hysterics combined with lows, were dirving hr crazy. When I watched it again, I had to more or less agree that the attention to his BPD was perhaps overdone.

But Jennifer Lawrence admirably counter balances Pat's quirky behavior and the scene with the dance competition is superb - especially as it is linked to the bets on a critical (Philadelphia)  Eagles' football game.

5173067,5,B008OGIPJA,"I was told by several friends not to see this movie because it was terrible. So I didn't. Until tonight. I am an Amazon addict so I'm hoping they will let this review stand. Tonight it came on a pay channel (which shall not be named), and I decided that I would watch it out of curiosity to see how people really think they know me so well. Obviously, they don't know me well at all!

The first hour is over-the-top crazy. I decided that all my friends were right and almost deleted it then. Then Jennifer Lawrence, the young actor I like and have heard great thing about, happened. When she flew into gear in this movie about the time she started to teach Bradly Cooper to dance, I saw what all the snobby critics are seeing in her. This youngster has some very strong acting chops. The last half of the movie, Cooper slowly but surely faded into the background and Ms. Lawrence literally took the movie over, made it her's as she slyly manipulated Cooper emotionally into getting what she wanted for herself all along, or so she thought.

To say more would be to ruin this movie if you haven't seen it. We have found the youngest generation's most brilliant actor - this ONE time I will say this: The critics were right! This  movie defines the word drama as in - ""Wow, is that girl screaming at her boyfriend a drama queen or what?"" Throughout the movie, there seems to be this jittery competition to see who can deliver the most drama to get the title.

If you want to know the ending that threw me for a loop - you'll just have to rent it or get it here, or pick it up on the unnamed pay channel. This movie is not like any others I have seen. It is very sexy at times, and yet no one ever has sex in it. The language was rather tame, more than I am hearing it lately. But don't bring the kiddies - it is filled with adult topics and is definitely adult themed. I had a little trouble following it all the way through, as it moves very fast and you never know what most characters are going to do or say. And, I think that's part of what I liked about it. There was an old fashioned feel to it, with quirky and younger pacing.

This movie is so brilliant, that you are never sure what will happens next and whether what happens will be a normal moment or, more likely, a crazy moment. Overall, this movie has a dark, emotional, CRAZY, edge to it, which probably wouldn't sit well for someone with a dark and jagged edge. I'd already had a heads up from my friends, so I simply watched it to entertain me, not to ponder whatever the message was for a few days.

You'll have to watch the ending for yourselves, though. My fingers are sealed! five stars for whoever asked Jennifer Lawrence to play lead, the rest of the cast who were great, too, and the group of people who worked to bring this craziest movie to the silver screen.",1390089600,,2833,4.237037037037037
5173068,3,B008OGIPJA,"The first hour of this film is relentlessly downbeat and depressing, seething with feel-bad hostility and recriminations, as Bradley Cooper is released from a Baltimore mental institution after eight months of rehab.  He comes home to mom and dad (Robert DeNiro), and finds that dad's livelihood is now entirely given over to sports gambling.  Both father and son are rabid Philadelphia Eagles fans.  Although the Bradley Cooper character has been diagnosed as bipolar, the violent rages he displays don't really fit the bipolar paradigm, and his general hostility seems to magically dissipate after he begins taking modern dance lessons with Jennifer Lawrence, whose husband has passed away. (Her husband has passed away and she's going through her own set of trauma, although it is hardly believable that such a beauty has been promiscuously sleeping around, as she asserts). The Cooper character was stashed in the nuthouse after he caught his wife in the shower having sex with a high school teacher colleague and apparently flipped out.  How this equates to bipolar disorder is never explained.  If you caught your wife in the shower that way, you'd probably flip too.  Naturally, from initial nastiness, abrasiveness and hostility (how anyone could be nasty to drop-dead gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence, she of the heavy eye shadow, albeit herself relentlessly hostile throughout the entire film, is tough to understand) emerges the sweet flower of love.  I'll say no more, as the movie wends its way to a phony happy ending.  The actors try their best, but there is not much they can do with a thin script.  Most of the scenes of bickering feel improvised rather than scripted.  There's no real sense of character arc here, and that the family fortunes suddenly hinge on a dance contest and a bet on a Philadelphia Eagles game seem quite a stretch.",1390003200,,1850,5.055921052631579

5173180,4,B008OGIPJA,"The movie didn't really grab me at first, but it did when the relationship between Pat and Tiffany developed and evolved. Good character building. These are the kind of people one grows up with and knows intimately. I liked the small-knit community feel-the families were all involved in the problems Pat and Tiffany had to overcome. The viewer learns that Pat Sr. also has the same problem as his son, which he never overcame, just worked into his life. There are very subtle things happening, like Pat Sr. always rubbing his good luck hankie-OCD right there. The part when they were performing on the dance floor made me cry, and I don't know why, it just hit me in the heart. I felt good that here these damaged souls were, trying to make something of their young lives before it is too late. Wonderful movie, I would highly recommend it.",1388793600,,841,4.613333333333333

5173182,5,B008OGIPJA,I gave it five stars and two thumbs up because of reasons. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and beautiful and I think she probably knows magic.,1388793600,,139,4.6
5173183,4,B008OGIPJA,"To be honest, I put off watching this movie for so long because I hated the book.  Which as some of you may know, the movies are normally worse than the books.  They write out your favorite part, they change crucial details in order to save time, or sometimes they change everything so completely.  In this movie everything they did worked so much better! I'm not sure if it was because I wasn't a fan of the writing style so actually seeing it play out in film helped with it or if it was just the amazing acting.  Whatever the combination was it worked.  I felt this movie was worth the 7 dollars that I paid for it.  I can completely understand why Jennifer Lawrence got an Oscar for her role in this movie.  If you haven't read the book yet...I would recommend that you don't.  It saddens me to say that for the first time in my 20 some odd years I have finally found a story that I prefer in movie form rather than book.  Dark day for me, but a very enlightening day for Silver Linings.  This movie isn't conventional and if you are looking for a cookie cutter romance, this isn't it.  It is real. A story about people who have real problems, that aren't perfect, that aren't even sane most the time, but it works.

Like I said, totally worth the money...if I could only return the book.",1388707200,6,1292,4.271604938271605
5173184,2,B008OGIPJA,"Everyone raved about this movie, I didn't think it was as good as everyone said it was.
Should have waited for the DVD at my local public  library to see it for free.",1388707200,2,166,4.03030303030303
5173185,5,B008OGIPJA,"Bradley Cooper is a good actor in the sense he can be funny -then crazy, mad, and deceptive. His acting ability is awesome and he takes pride in his work. I like to watch his movies to see what he will do next or what the story line is and how he adapts to it. The girl is real, funny, serious, and lively. She was a great co-partner in this movie and I would like to see more of her movies.",1388707200,,391,3.8395061728395063

5173189,5,B008OGIPJA,"I love this movie for a lot of reasons. I can relate to the characters and I am originally from the Philadelphia area so it is fun that a lot of the locations in the film are so recognizable. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular in the role even though she is so young; she plays the ""crazy widow"" part well. The characters are easy to fall in love with. It is refreshing to see a movie portray struggles such as mental illness as less of an illness and more of a life struggle. Because of this it is easy to root for the two main characters throughout the movie. Great flick.",1388620800,,572,4.209090909090909

5173201,5,B008OGIPJA,"I'm not a huge romantic comedy fan, but this was great! I thought it was going to be all saccharin and sweet, but went for it, given the high critics & viewers reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and elsewhere. There was some darkness, which gave the storyline substance. The storyline itself was great. The characters were dynamic, surprising, funny, and insightful. Excellent cast!!",1388620800,,375,5.064516129032258
5173202,2,B008OGIPJA,"Over-hyped, slow-story, not worth $10.00 or even $7.00 for that matter... Actors & actresses were wonderful despite it being a disappointing film.",1388620800,,146,5.681818181818182

5173205,5,B008OGIPJA,I first checked out and viewed this movie at my local library. I loved this movie so much that I bought it from Amazon the next day. This story is filled with many emotions. And to think that art does imitate life.,1388620800,,214,4.119047619047619
5173206,5,B008OGIPJA,Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved the Oscar for this movie! It was a shame that the male actor category was full of such strong performances this year as I really think Bradley Cooper could've won as well. Glad he was nominated at least! Really fantastic story of damaged people coming to the realization that they aren't the only ones that are damaged and that at least they are finding ways to deal with it. Originally saw it in the movie theater early in 2013 and preordered it right away! Definitely a feel good movie!,1388534400,,526,4.666666666666667
5173207,5,B008OGIPJA,It was an amazing movie.  I thought it was perfectly cast and all actors and actresses did an wonderful job.  I think it is something everyone should watch.  Families can be as dysfunctional as this family.  Very realistic in places.  You need to watch it.,1388534400,,256,4.6
5173208,3,B008OGIPJA,Mediocre movie that did not live up to the oscar season hype.  We were disappointed.  The choked dance hold during the dance competition sums it all up.,1388534400,,152,4.592592592592593
5173209,1,B008OGIPJA,"Can't watch video. Pauses, starts up, pauses again! Tried everything. Not our TV connection. Happens with every video I purchase from Amazon. Not any other company. Waste of money since I can't watch it properly!!",1388534400,,213,5.114285714285714

5173211,5,B008OGIPJA,I loved this movie!  I actually paid full price to see it in  movie theaters---four times.  I'm a sucker for a love story but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play these mentally unstable  characters so convincingly that you are rooting for them all the way. I wish Mr. Cooper had received the Oscar for his outstanding performance.,1388448000,,336,4.842105263157895

5173214,5,B008OGIPJA,"I'm a big Bradley Cooper fan, and this one is his best movie ever.

5173224,5,B008OGIPJA,"This movie had us laughing and amazed at the telling of the story. Both main characters and all supporting characters are enjoyable.

5173225,5,B008OGIPJA,Controlled chaos! Excellent film with great acting. A different perspective on mental illness and love. Sometimes the ones deemed crazy are actually more sane than those around them.,1388275200,,182,5.535714285714286

5173229,5,B008OGIPJA,bought this movie after seeing something on CNN news where they were talking about making people aware of Mental Illness.  I really enjoyed it very much and the characters played their parts very well! I have encouraged others to watch it as well.,1388102400,,247,4.744186046511628
5173230,4,B008OGIPJA,Bradley Cooper deserved an academy award for his performance.  Terrific range of acting.  When you believe what you are seeing is real then you're watching real acting.  Jennifer Lawrence was great but I thought her role in Hunger Games gave her more of an opportunity to display the depth of her acting ability but nevertheless a great performance. The storyline was not as great as the performances but despite that flaw it was still a very entertaining film.,1388102400,,461,4.884615384615385

5173236,5,B008OGIPJA,"The movie lives up to its name...there IS a silver lining in the end...you'll have to watch it to find out what.  As a sufferer of depression myself it is a very telling tale, many recurring themes that have marked my life as well.  However, Bradley Cooper's character battles through it all to find a peace with himself, his family and his loved one's.  The ending is worth the long buildup.  A MUST SEE movie.",1387843200,,411,4.44

My wife and I do a Saturday night movie night, Pick a Video, make some popcorn, Drink some wine and generally find time to spend together. I heard good things about her performance in this movie, and wanted to see if she was as good as I hearing she was, I was not disappointed, Coming off the Hunger games stepping into this movie, Wow she really is one of the up and coming actresses. Just to note this My Opinion only, as I stated before I am really enamored with her. But it was a great performance, I recommend it.",1387756800,,568,4.220183486238532

5173240,3,B008OGIPJA,"I was a huge fan of Matthew Quick's novel, The Silver Linings Playbook, so I've been eagerly anticipating my chance to watch the movie.

Without giving too much of the plot away, this was a meh adaptation, and I'm a little shocked at the amount of critical praise it received. Yes, Jennifer Lawrence's performance was excellent, but as adaptation goes, this one managed to achieve both overkill in the plot changes as well as taking an excellent book and turning it into a meh experience.

The movie version adds several plot twists that didn't exist in the book, making the movie a veritable madcap circus of crazy. We have a dance competition at which the two mentally ill main characters are obviously outclassed, a hit-you-over-the-head-it's-so-obvious father who's probably as close to the edge as his mentally ill son is, and so much going on it's hard to keep everything straight.

Worst of all, the movie took a book that had a very moving portrayal of mental illness and turns it into a ""Hey! Look at all these nutjobs!"" type of movie. Losing the subtlety lost a lot of the impact.

My recommendation: watch it for the performances, not the plot.",1387670400,,1155,4.76
5173241,5,B008OGIPJA,this movie is excellent - really looks into individual personalities - first time seeing Bradley Cooper - wonderful actor - will look for more of his movies on Netflix,1387670400,,167,4.793103448275862

5173243,3,B008OGIPJA,"I thought this was going to be totally different than it was.  The acting was great, top notch.  However, this is in no way a comedy, very... sad? almost.  Story of mental disorders and lost loves.",1387497600,,197,4.416666666666667

5173250,2,B008OGIPJA,In the first part of the movie the dialogue and the scenes come at you so fast that it's hard to figure out what's going on. Then you realize that it's much ado about nothing. The characters are represented so superficially. We don't really know enough about what happened to them or why they're the way they are to really care about them. I haven't seen Bradley Cooper or Jennifer Lawrence in that many movies but they were both quite good I will say. I don't know if Jennifer's performance was impressive enough to win the Academy Award. DeNiro was DeNiro as usual. He's done a lot of good movies but as an actor he doesn't have a great deal of range.. I have seen the previews for the new movie American Hustle. It really looked interesting. I then realized that it was directed by the same guy that directed this movie. I'll skip it for now. I may rent it some time.,1387152000,2,870,4.343558282208589

5173262,2,B008OGIPJA,"I decided to watch the movie due to all the great reviews.  It started off promising.  However, about half way through (maybe a little more) when I got tired of waiting for something to happen, whether entertaining or not, I turned it off.  Maybe if had watched all the way to end, I would have been rewarded with the best ending ever.  But, I reasoned that I shouldn't have to sit through the most boring, pointless, attempt at depressing/funny(?) movie to see what is going to happen in the end.

5173270,3,B008OGIPJA,"I came to this with misgivings - on the whole I think Americans do not do movies or TV shows about mental illness at all well.

This film in particular was really not that original - remember AS GOOD AS IT GETS with Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, Gooding Jr.?

I thought the actual standout performance was from Bradley Cooper rather than Jennifer Lawrence, although I admit Ms Lawrence was for me nearly as good, I thought Cooper was the outstanding actor.

De Niro does some of his best work in many years and really nails his character, as does Australian actress (Yes!) Jackie Weaver.

At its heart, the film is, surprise surprise, a bit of a fable, a bit of candy floss, with a fairy-tale ending.

It was a bit weird to see Lucky Thompson's brother from Boardwalk Empire turn up as Cooper's brother - that was a bit of a clanger for me. Great actor - wrong role to cast him in.

I thought the film was a mite simplistic and really didn't go into any great detail about anything.

After watching it, I do not entirely understand why Lawrence got her Oscar for her role in the film. I cannot now remember any of the other contenders, but I didn't think she got as much under the skin of her character the way Cooper was able to.

Obviously, that is just my personal opinion. The Oscars were handed out and Lawrence is riding a well-deserved wave to super-stardom - I don't wish to detract from that one iota.

I guess I would have liked to see these same two leads tackle the story with a denser script when they are perhaps 10-15 years older.

It has some beautifully achieved moments and has a lot of serious things to say without slapping you between the eyes with a dead fish to get the message across.

It is also tragic in parts and at its heart the film is about the fracture lines that may evolve in human lives but also what might come along.

For me the main message was to persevere, and that where one may be falling it takes another, and usually more than one, usually family, to help.

In a nutshell, unconditional love.

I didn't give it 4 stars (just missed out) as I didn't think it entirely warranted such a rating, but it still has much to say and the performances are all solid.

Maybe for me it was the storyline/screenplay that underwhelmed me a little - I felt I'd seen it all before. But don't let me stop you.

Well worth a viewing (box of tissues on hand, ladies - and some of us guys too!)",1386201600,,2414,4.319290465631929

When I first watched it, I was worried it was going to be too dark and depressing.  But it is an uplifting story.  And it's different from the usual fare.  I also recommend reading the book.

The only...thing is that watching it is kind of stressful, especially in the beginning. It comes with the context, though. The story is honest, and reality is rarely always painless or frustration free. I'll probably have to wait a while before I can watch this one through again, but I will definitely be watching it again.

I was wrong I found it very enteraining and out of the box ans it has a mesaage to boot.  In the back of  my mind I kpet thinking Jennifer Lawernce is to young for this role Bradley Cooper is much older I believe but she pulls it off nicely. Speaking Bradley he is amazing, perhaps his best role. Deniro is back in form. Two other actors, whose name escape me were equally brilliant and I enjoy over and over, his best friend who appeared in ""Pride and Glory"" and the Mom from ""Animal Kingdom"" (Australian Movie) are the icing on the cake.  Bottom line it is good to see Mr Cooper outside the ""Hunk"" fest and palying a less than glamorous role.",1385856000,,786,4.185430463576159

5173309,4,B008OGIPJA,"(Rounded up from 3-1/2 Stars) Spoiler Alert! When I heard it received 8 Academy Award/Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, I thought, oh, it must be life-affirming good; when I heard ""playbook,"" I thought, okay, it must be mostly about football; and when I heard about Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win for Best Actress, I thought, well, her character must get sick in the movie, like Debra Winger in ""Terms of Endearment."" Well, as it turns out, I was wrong on all three accounts, and though not similar (but good in its own right), it certainly is not up on the same level with ""Terms of Endearment"" (try watching them back to back). Based on a novel, I never expected to so quickly file it under the category of being a little, dare I say it, sappy (the kicker being the Christmas-lights scene in the street towards the end) with its ""silver linings"" and few surprises (like the identity of the letter writer; the letter was typed out, for goodness' sake), only with slight variations in characters you would usually see in movies, and stretched out over no less than 122 minutes! (Did we really need to see that whole ""Dancing with the Stars"" subplot?) On the plus side, though, were great acting performances all around (including I'm-not-just-a-pretty-boy Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, and Jacki Weaver, all Oscar-nominated, too), not just by the lovely Lawrence, even while dropping several F-bombs (unnecessary), though it was actually DeNiro who delivered the Oscar-caliber performance, with the best scenes actually not between Lawrence and Cooper but between DeNiro and Cooper, father and son (especially when Dad, through tears, blames himself for his son's issues, seeming to want to make amends in that touching father-and-son scene at the end of the dance competition, when pleading for his son to choose the girl he really loves so that his son can finally find true happiness, with Junior embracing his Dad as if realizing this and forgiving him; their relationship should have been the movie's focal point, even if it wasn't so in the book), with the movie's most redeeming value being its positive portrayal of people with mental health issues as people we all know and love.

You're better off just reading the book or just watch the movie.  You can't do both.  If you want to, then watch the movie first.  Each actor/actress owned their character on screen, but the chemistry with each other was very lacking.

5173326,5,B008OGIPJA,"Growing up we all hear from our seniors how all these things were better in their younger days. Watching this movie made me realize I am turning into one of them, since the first thought that popped in my mind was ""Years ago there were more movies that were as good as this one and I had almost forgotten what this was like"". So I guess the answer is yes, at least in what has to do with me and the movie industry.

This film is one of the few in the last several years that have made me cherish sitting down to watch a movie. I have seen plenty of entertaining and thrilling films, but this one has no gimmicks to keep you enthralled. It is all about the story, the performances and the emotion. When the paths of two broken people collide, we get to see the best of human nature. Bradley Cooper is excellent in his portrayal of Pat, a bipolar that ended up in an institution as a result of an episode involving his wife and a lover. Now he is out and trying to get her back. But is Cooper's performance is excellent, there are few adjectives to describe the unbelievable performance of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a woman whose life unraveled when her husband died. Both of them are trying to heal and finding each other may prove either helpful of devastating. There are many other characters that add color to this plot, such as the amazing Robert De Niro, who plays Pat's father and does so in his usual masterful way.

This movie delivered pretty much everything you can expect to get when you sit down for the experience. There were laughs, touching moments, a story that kept us interested throughout, and actors that made us care about the characters. It definitely deserved its nomination for best picture, and in my humble opinion it should have won. This is one that you cannot afford to miss.",1384041600,,1806,4.42042042042042

5173343,3,B008OGIPJA,"The book was sooooo much better!!! The father in the movie is a completely different sort of character, and there's way more football in the book. The main character in the book has so many more dimensions about him - he goes through significant struggle and transformation. The movie characters were prettier in general than they were in the book - far less risky I guess. Bradley Cooper is always great to look at and I love Robert De Niro - but I think the screen adaptation and directing were timid given the characters that Matthew Quick created in his book. There was opportunity to take great characters and combine them with great actors and produce a great movie - but that opportunity was clearly missed with this very watered down version. If you haven't read the book it's probably a fun movie to rent... Even if you have seen the movie - if you like to read go get this book - it's a great way to spend an afternoon.",1383350400,,929,4.43859649122807

5173348,5,B008OGIPJA,"It took me a while to get on board, but this is a seriously funny and insightful move. The scene where  Bradley Cooper is horrified by his (sort of) girlfriend's social deficit is worth the price of admission. If you like movies about people who have taken a left turn and don't know how they got there, you'll enjoy this.",1383004800,,322,4.366666666666666

Plus a DVD is thrown in in-case you take is somewhere and they don't have a blu-ray player or if you expect to purchase a blu-ray player in the future and want the DVD now. And for the 3 viewing options you get with this product it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Totally worth it!

Plus it's an amazing movie, what else could you want from it?",1381881600,,414,4.111111111111111
5173388,5,B008OGIPJA,"Wonderful script and strong acting throughout. Jennifer Lawrence, of course, won an Oscar for the role, but Bradley Cooper, Riobert De Niro and Jacki Weaver all did outstanding jwork. Jacki Weaver's portrayal of the mother was very nuanced - I felt that she should have won for Best Supporting Actress.

It is unusual to have a romatic comedy with such strong underlying dramatic themes - emotional/mental illness, letting go, redemptive relationships - but this movie embraces all of that with a strong sense of humor and empathy.",1381795200,,531,5.103448275862069
5173389,3,B008OGIPJA,"I watched this and really didn't think it was that great.  It's a passable movie about people breaking out of their own prisons and moving up to a new level, however that is being really generous in reviewing it.  The story line was rather generic and the acting was OK but not to the high level I had expected given that all of the major performers were nominated.  I have to say I thought Bradley Cooper was the best given the manic intensity of his character.

All-in-all this was a decent movie but not deserving of the major acclaim it received.  Not bad but you can wait for it to come to cable or TV.",1381708800,,607,4.243478260869566

It's starts off as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, then ...Sling Blade, then ....the Albert Brooks film Modern Romance, then ends up as Strictly Ballroom. Really the movie itself was schizophrenic, kind of a mess, not great character development, a little flat. Why does Hollywood today just recycle, & in this case just borrow a little bit of from this film, a little of that ....from films that were great. This isn't a great movie, it was ok, it had a few moments here & there, but I've seen all those moments before,....

This was a kind and loving gesture because he remembered that I had wanted to see the film when it was released in theaters. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a touching film of a character around Pat Solitano, whose life is turned upside down after he undergoes treatment for an episode that triggered him reacting with extreme aggression. Pat's parents take him in and he unexpectedly meets and falls in love with a woman named Tiffany.  He does his best to avoid showing it because he is trying to reconcile with his wife Nikki. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a moving drama film that is good for those who are familiar with any movies featuring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and/or Robert De Niro and/or those who movies with comedy, drama, and/or romance.",1381363200,,847,4.957746478873239

I had heard a lot of buzz about how good it was and how many awards it was up for and I like Jennifer and Bradley a lot in things I have seen them in so far.  I did enjoy the movie but it didn't meet my expectations I had built it up to be and that was my fault mainly.  The story about two dysfunctional people trying to make a functioning relationship work was funny and sad at the same time, but after watching this and thinking about most of the relationships I know of, dysfunctional isn't too far off from some of the best.

5173493,2,B008OGIPJA,"Jennifer Lawrence should have gotten an Oscar for ""Winter's Bone"", not a movie that feels bland and lifeless like ""Silver Lining's Playbook"". There really is no story here, and what little there is could only be made entertaining by the great actors in this movie. Thumbs down.",1379808000,,277,4.914893617021277
5173494,1,B008OGIPJA,"I don't know what it was about Silver Linings Playbook, but I just thought it was terrible and I can't put my finger on why.  People originally told me they felt that the film was a fantastic and accurate representation of bipolar disorder, but I myself have wrestled with a profound and debilitating case of bipolar for over twenty years and I do not give S.L.P. the same accolades.  I felt that it was unrealistic at best and patronizing at worst.  Cooper is a very talented actor, don't get me wrong; it wasn't his delivery I had a problem with.  Just as a house must have a strong foundation, the groundwork for any good film is its writing, way before any of the actors, props, and other details are fleshed out ... and the writing of S.L.P. left much to be desired.",1379808000,30,771,4.408450704225352
5173495,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook is a nicely written movie that doesn't gloss over the conflicts of mental illness within families.  Nor does it ""dumb down"" the characters who suffer the afflictions.  There was a sincere honesty depicted in the family dynamics, and a genuine awareness by the two main characters of their own problems and how it impacts everyone around them.

5173502,5,B008OGIPJA,"So much has been said about Silver Linings Playbook (both good and bad). In an effort not to be redundant or repetitive about just how brilliant this film is I will take a slightly different angle in its analysis. For starters, the acting is stellar and right on point with depicting the struggles of living with bipolar and manic depression. The main characters (brilliantly played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) are forced to confront their demons and all the while learn from each other about coping with ups and downs. Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a state institution, as part of a plea bargain after violently assaulting a man in the throws with his wife. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young widow who suffers with the very same condition he deals with. Medicines have not worked well for either of them. Their inner anguish is badly stigmatized by those around them and their erratic behavior badly impairs their social lives and connection with the world around them. Still, their insight and inability to filter (in the words of Pat) provide them with a rare insight into the world that others do not have. Some may call it insight. I call it a badly broken kind of brilliance. Pat's mantra is ""excelsior."" This fuels his wish to find the silver lining in every situation in his life - good or bad.

In spite of the restraining order that Pat's wife has against him, he wishes to give a letter to her anyway. Tiffany will deliver the letter on the condition that he practice and be part of a dance competition with her as her partner. This arrangement paves the way to an interesting series of developments. Not planning to give away any more plot details beyond this. If you want more, simply read the other reviews. I do want to state that I appreciate the frank depiction and sensitivity that mental illness is portrayed in this film. It is not easy to watch the painful outbursts and anguish that the characters go through. Yet, the actors do such a brilliant and sensitive job with their roles that you are left with great insight into the mind and conflicts behind mania, manic depression, bipolar and emotional pain. Extraordinary. Jennifer Lawrence definitely earned her Oscar here. What a brilliant young actress I look forward to seeing more of in the future.",1379548800,,2319,4.754342431761787
5173503,5,B008OGIPJA,"This was a very funny movie that dealt with the painful topic of mental illness.  I liked that it depicted the anguish of the characters and their very real struggles with day to day coping, yet kept you laughing throughout.  The actors were amazing in their portrayals and the direction was top notch.  I've watched it twice and would watch it again, and I'm not one to watch movies over and over.  It's not often you find a movie dealing with mental illness that not only depicts the difficulty of living with such a disease but leaves you with hope that anyone can overcome the debilitating aspects of this disease with the right medication, love and support.",1379548800,,662,4.632478632478633

5173529,5,B008OGIPJA,This movie was filled with humor and accuracy about people that are just like any average person.  Taking into account that all people have issues they deal with.

This movie translates well past the Philly area, though.  The character dynamics alone are worth watching.  My movie library is quite small, only those films I can watch multiple times.  This movie makes the cut.  I recommend this movie to family and friends and now to even complete strangers.",1378944000,,498,4.927710843373494

One of those movies that makes you realize that you can love again and that you're not as crazy as you think you are! lol.  Someone just might be weirder than you.  Funny love story and definitely worth watching with someone else or even alone.,1378512000,,423,4.397435897435898

I was excited to get it once it came out on DVD and found it horribly boring, confusing, and awkward.  The movie, while the cast is what attracted me to this movie, as I typically love Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro movies, this one is horrible.  The acting seems too staged, not believable at all.  The movie plot is confusing and boring.  In addition, there are multiple situations that happened during the movie which I found uncomfortable and awkward, mostly random outbursts about sexual activity.  Not worth your time to watch.",1378512000,2,685,4.666666666666667

While I think the movie was good and the performances good as well, and I do understand the accolades that followed. However, I guess what is hard for me to digest is that the book felt really gentle and romantic and quirky where as this film is just CRACKLING with angry man energy that just wasn't there in the book. Now I understand cinematic metaphor and specifically the irony with this adaptation, in that it's a book about a guy who thinks his life is a Hollywood movie, but as it turns out life isn't a Hollywood movie, yet this is a Hollywood movie...my head is spinning. For me the movie did not stay true to the spirit of the written work and for that it fell a little flat for me.",1378512000,,767,4.333333333333333

5173632,5,B008OGIPJA,I now see why both lead actors got nominated for Oscars. Both Bradley and Jennifer played their characters so well. Storyline was well written and a good mix of drama and comedy.,1377993600,,178,4.59375
5173633,5,B008OGIPJA,"That just don't make films like this anymore. I would strongly suggest the planet should watch this film. Its a Dark humor but the kind of humor thats actually funny and not over the top. Everyone in this film is dysfunctional and don't even realize it. I love films like this when they are NOT trying to be funny but just generally messed up people. The movie hits on alot of stereotypes of people and how they relate. Tiffany was the type of woman that I have always wished for . She was sexy without trying Dark, Tough, Straight forward, and Sensual. The thing I loved the most about her character is you could tell the love she had for Pat was special. She didn't show that side to everyone and it was very obvious. She was a hard girl but a vunerable kitten to Patrick. Thats when you know a person really loves you and only you. When you see a certain side of a person and noone else gets that same pleasure.

 Pats wife was the stereotypical Prissy type along with Tiffany's sister (Julia Stiles). Jennifer Lawrence deserves everything she recieved for her performance. She was very convincing through out the entire film. You could see her love and pain through out the film. I really felt sorry for her because Pat was so cruel at times even just right out mean and judgmental. But for what ever reason she still wanted him and didn't give up. The thing that enamored me the most is that he didn't have anything to offer. But yet instill she loved him unconditionaly and still wanted to be apart of his life. The Dinner, Jogging scenes and at the Cafe are absolutley classic and unforgettable. This is a film that will stand the test of time for many years to come or even generations. You only get one of these types of films like every 7 to 10 years. The last time I felt this intrigued by a film was when Matchpoint (2005) and Closer (2004) came out. U just don't get many realistic straight forward films in Hollywood anymore. There is alot of great dialogue in this film that is unforgettable.

Although Closer and Matchpoint are two totally different types of films. They are still just as unique and intoxicating as Silver Linings. Robert Deniro did his part as usual and his character was quirky as well. In the end the movie shows how people can be judged and what society deems as a normal person or trophy wife. Bradley Cooper's Character was somewhat judmental and very closed minded . He felt by society standards his ex cheating wife was the perfect woman. But in the end he realized what he needed and what was best for him. Which I am certainly glad he figured it out before it was too late. I can say with out doubt it would have haunted him for the rest his life. I know, I still till this day wish I knew this girl that I was friends with. She was beautiful hard, tattooed and VERY unique . But because at the time I wanted the take home to mom type. I didn't give her a chance and It haunts me everyday. Years later I have never met anyone that came close to her. With out spoiling the film just watch it you won't be disappointed.",1377993600,,3060,4.355516637478108

5173638,5,B008OGIPJA,"Finally got a chance to see this movie last night and although feeling a bit lazy decided to refer to the wonderful review by katybrit, in her well written opening paragraph. Quote: ""This is why we go to movies. Silver Linings Playbook is that rare breed of movie where all the moving parts got put together in exactly the right way. The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy. The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.""- I would add that this is a movie maker's movie, a brilliant production from top down and bottom up with powerful riveting performances by the lovely and bit scary Jennifer Lawrence, talented Bradley Cooper, Robert DiNero and Jacki Weaver along with the rest of the cast. The director David O Russell has done a great job translating this book into film; I'm always amazed at people with such talent. I use the word scary to describe the young, attractive Ms. Lawrence as this is the second time I've been impressed by her powerful performance as an actress the first being her superb role in ""Winters Bone"". Mr. Cooper should be commended for being up to the task of matching the performance of such a talented actress. This is in my opinion is one of the best dramatic films to come along in many years and was an absolutely delightful and entertaining experience, don't miss it.",1377907200,,1506,4.686792452830189

It is just not a feel good rom com, so if that's what you're looking for, you may want to look elsewhere. Despite a few funny moments, it deals with some very intense subjects such as mental illness and death. It's definately worth watching, if for no other reason to have a deeper understanding and compassion for folks in real life struggling with mental issues and pain. And it balances thoses issues respectfully, intriguingly, and realistically; but if you're looking for a lighthearted escape, this just isn't it.",1377648000,,654,4.900900900900901

5173688,3,B008OGIPJA,"Boy, I must have read the wrong review before I saw this.  I went in expecting a Serious Movie, but instead, this is a rom-com hiding behind the scrims of depression, OCD, and bipolar disorder.  I guess pulling off mild comedy behind those topics displays a certain deftness, but it doesn't make this movie historically great, either.  De Niro is clearly here to raise financing for the film, which means he can mail in a variant of his increasingly-standarized post-Meet-the-Fockers persona.  The whole pro-football-as-obsession side story is as pathetic here as it is in real life (and I say that as an NFL fan!).  Still, on the plus side, the byplay between Cooper and Lawrence--the main reason for the film--is very well done, and there is no doubt that Lawrence is the Real Thing as an actress.",1377475200,2,799,4.802919708029197

5173773,3,B008OGIPJA,"Im always a little wary about these Hollywood films being toted and talked about by critics as though it were the coming of the Lord. So I wasn't disappointed by this film because I had low expectations to begin with. Bradly Cooper is one of my favorite actors. I loved his last film, the one that is like a splice between Total Recall and Inception. Jennifer Lawrence, however, I am not crazy about. I didn't find her role in Winter's Bone to be all THAT. It was an ok film. Not shocking, enthralling or mesmorizing at all to me. Obvious, however, yes. She was good in the Hunger Games, but I think its true what they say, ""You're only as good as the actor in front of you."" And she had a lot of actors in front of her that day. I know, you could say the same about her role up against Bradly, and you may be right. Sometimes he isn't that great either. But this isn't one of those times.

In this role Cooper is just being released from a mental hospital after the nervous breakdown he suffered due to the discovery of his wife's infidelity with one of Cooper's co-workers. On the day of his release, Cooper decides he is going to get his wife back and make things right again by being positive, truthful and compassionate to the needs of others, as he was none of these things in his marriage before the breakdown. He meets Lawrence's character at the dinner party of a longtime friend, whose wife decides to tempt fate by trying to set up her sister (Lawrence) whom is grieving the loss of her husband with Cooper. The dinner is a disaster, both Lawrence and Cooper spend the evening discussing which medications they have been taking. An awkward moment arrives and Cooper has to excuse himself. Lawrence follows in pursuit, hits on Cooper, is denied, slaps him and then exits. It was funny but I also felt their tension, confusion and awkwardness. I have had moments like this. I am bipolar and recently experienced something similar at a dinner party. I hate dinner parties. I hate parties.

The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard. Cooper, I thought did a good job though in conveying the hardships of an mental illness when involving relationships. The scene in the attic bedroom when he comes unhinged and the cops are called was meant to be funny Im sure, but to me, it was real. And it was frightening. I've been there. So props to Cooper for a job well done.",1376784000,2,2441,4.4222222222222225

This is definitely one of my new favorites.",1376697600,,360,4.640625
5173789,5,B008OGIPJA,"I never heard of this movie until my wife made me search for it on our streaming services.  Out of the gate, it seemed edgy and I thought it might be a depressing drama.  I wasn't in the mood for a tear-jerker or a wild ride through misery and misfortune.  That impression was way off, but the edgy start did get me engaged in a hurry.  The characters are well-played, and you feel their emotions.  Special effects played no role -- how refreshing!  Here is a movie that pulls you in and carries you along based on the human story.  I loved it!

It is a crazy romance, among other things.  'nuff said.",1376697600,,601,4.247787610619469

I was kind of disappointed within the first five minutes of the movie because right away it was nothing like the book. But I love a good story and I have to say I still enjoyed their spin on the book. You don't get the sense of what goes on in the characters mind like you do with the book but they still did a charming job of Pat and his family/friends and his journey to his 'silver lining'.,1376611200,,499,4.0

A semi-modern variation on the girl-meets-boy plot, embellished by the rehab slant on things and the dance element.  The love triangle between Bradley Cooper and the two women was played out til the end.  The comedy of the running scenes was great.... literally chasing the guy down the street!  Funny.  Bradley Cooper is SO watchable; he has an innocence that we hope doesn't become jaded; after all he's still a new star.  Jennifer can't remember her last name is on the verge of becoming over-exposed already.  There were too many closeups of her face, no matter how much you like her.",1376611200,,701,4.743801652892562

Jennifer Lawrence is cute as all hell in the film, Bradley Cooper does a nice job (I remember him from the Alias days), DeNero plays a decent fatherly-figure, could've did without Chris Tucker.

This film has real insight into mental illness and is a very powerful romance, while being very funny, too.

Twenty minutes in I thought I must have selected the wrong movie. It is a slow, disjointed story that ultimately follows a predictable Hollywood formula. Lawrence and Cooper are good portraying mentally troubled individuals who find something in each other. I like Lawrence but her character is raw and troubled but also poorly formed. It was hard to determine what role her mental illness played in being so unlikable or unsympathetic...vs just being mean and manipulative. Cooper's character was understandable...but frankly seemed over the top. Perhaps that is the brilliance in the story and the acting...the uniqueness and nuances of mental illness in each individual.

The book and movie are VASTLY different. Pat just wasn't nearly as crazy as he needed to be for his idiosyncrasies to be plausible. The movie had pat explaining why he had been in ""the bad place"" within the first 20 minutes whereas the reader spends most of the book trying to find out why. The father-son relationship, the parents relationship and the relationship between Pat and his therapist were all wrong. The rewrites just did not make sense. The most accurate and believable character was Tiffany, who the screen writers made her look like the only crazy one. It just didn't sit well with me.

5173886,4,B008OGIPJA,"Somebody really loved author Mathew Quick's book, and it shows. The film is strong on solid story telling, sharp dialogue, and surprisingly, moments of insight into the slippery world of mental disorder. Apparently Quick brings real world experience to the table (check out his bio) having worked with mentally disabled children. The adapted screen play points to a deeply felt, original voice - somewhere in there.

While we get hints of something profound, the film pounds us with plenty to laugh at. Firmly grounded in the world of sports, betting, and (oddly) ball room dancing, this turns out to be a charming, romantic comedy neatly pinned down with acerbic dialogue and feisty, foul-mouthed, characters. What's not to love?

Nothing is too messy. Call it a comedy and be done with it because the drama is meek and completely in service of laughs.  But that's OK. We're clearly here to enjoy ourselves at the behest of some colorful characters and a very funny scenario.

Cloying-Cuteness Alert. DeNiro plays a crucial supporting role as a life-long neighborhood bookie - but he really needs a vacation from Dad roles. No spoilers here, except to note that his character cozies up to his newly rehabbed son for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, DeNiro hams it up and phones it in, sort of Focker redux.

I think this movie is about seeing the glass as half full and appreciating what is wonderful and worthwhile in every life....even a life that is extraordinarily complicated and challenging.

Now having mentioned amazing movies I have to come clean and say that a silly movie that never really made it big is the movie I have watched over and over a zillion times. It's called serendipity. Just something about it that I like and though it's not one of the greats, it's one of mine. Long story short, after all these years of serendipity I have to say it has been replaced. There is a reason that Silver linings got so much buzz. It's addictive! I love it! I will watch it a zillion times just like I did serendipity.

5173927,2,B008OGIPJA,"I realize that a movie based on a book should ideally be viewed on its own merits, but the screenplay managed to surgically remove my favorite parts of the book and drastically alter characters and events to an extent that I couldn't enjoy it on its own. The arc of Pat's self discovery of his aversion to Kenny G (which I can understand as a musician; but for some reason replaced by a Stevie Wonder song in the movie) was ham-handedly shoehorned in way too soon. Pat and Tiffany's first date at the diner was hilarious in the book, with Pat demonstrating his need to tip generously.  I felt that the producers didn't feel like paying Robert Deniro to speak as little as Pat's father did in the book. I also felt that the dance scene, completely changed from the book, was a crass attempt to exploit the popularity of ""Dancing With the Stars.""

In fact there are some great ideas and a even a half-decent portrayal of Bipolar Disorder and OCD, which by the way were more consistent with public perception than the actual presentation of these disorders. The story moves well, has enough depth to hold ones attention, and the two very attractive main characters helped. At the end however, the story felt to me as though it fell short of amazing, and just ended up another 21st century ""i'm kinda screwed up, but hey so is everyone else, and oh yey love!"", which is nauseatingly common in today's romantic comedies.

I watched her in Hunger Games just because she's cute.  However, I cringed when I saw she would be playing a more mature role in Silver Linings, but I am hella glad I decided to give it a watch.  I'm pretty positive I fell totally in love with Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany.

She was smart, witty, broken.  Just like all people in life.

The story was brilliant and evoked more emotion than your typical rom-com.

5174011,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Lingings Playbook is an odd little movie. It's about mental illness. Most movies about mental illness are rarely true to life. They are usually the Hollywood version. This movie is not entirely the Hollywood version. Although I did not like it that much, and it did have some Hollywood stretching in the story, it is the closest thing I have ever seen to a real life portrayl of people with mental issues. Don't get me wrong, although it is close, it is still a far stretch from real mentally ill people.

The storyline is not that great. In fact, I found it pretty bad. The Hollywood stretching, regarding the dance stuff, is simply unbelievable. It is the background acting, the simple everyday stuff, that make this movie so bizarrely interesting. Most all the actors in this movie do a great job. The family dynamics remind me of so many families I have encountered.

This movie would have been a lot better if the writers had left out the implausible parts. They were just too much of a stretch and really detracted from the movie.

While watching this movie, I was reminded of the TV show Roseanne. Roseanne, although it had some far fetched storylines, was one of the closest TV shows to ever portray real life families.

4 stars for great acting. 1 star detracted for the storyline.",1375228800,2,1297,4.650655021834061

Cooper has been in a mental institution and comes out trying to make a new life and get back with his wife. He's angry but I think the movie is overacted and I got bored with his tantrums  tantrums. Watchable but not my favorite. I turned off and back on to finish the next day.,1375228800,,428,4.095238095238095

5174039,5,B008OGIPJA,"Although it took me some time to remember the title of the film so I could order it, I had it on my list because of the subject material - Bi-polar illness, family relationships and someone like Robert De Niro to once again share his  talent with a cast I did not know.  The male/female roles were exquisite, heart-tugging and purposeful.  All in all an extremely satisfying story about a difficult illness and our attitudes towards those who struggle to live with it.

5174088,1,B008OGIPJA,This movie is depressing in content and pace. The entire first hour establishes and reestablishes the main character's mental illness and obsession with his estranged wife. It was so boring I turned it off.,1374710400,5,206,5.088235294117647

5174101,5,B008OGIPJA,"The Acting Performances are excellent of course, but David Russell should have won the Oscar for Best Director. I went to College in the Philly area, and have been to Upper Darby (Where the Jogging Scenes where Filmed), and Eagles Games and Tailgates. Russell could have filmed this in Toronto to save money, like most of the bottom liners in Hollywood, but he gave us the real deal. The Garbage Bag Sweat Suit by Cooper is so Philly, that I laughed out loud in the multiplex. DeNiro did his best work since ""Goodfellas"", Cooper went to a new level. Pat had so many obstacles, but his trying to stay positive was heart warming.

  Two aspects of this film , make this the best of the decade so far. A flawless musical score by Danny Elfman, merged with various artists like the Alabama Shakes, Dave Brubeck etc.. And as we saw with Ms. Lawrence in the ""Hunger Games"" dead on facial expressions that show the vulnerabilities of Tiffany without even a spoken word. Amazing how a 21 year old actress could deliver such a performance. The bonus scenes with the alternate ending is terrific also.",1374710400,,1091,4.61340206185567

Jennifer Lawrence is a great actor who is beyond fantastic in this role and clearly deserved the Oscar.  She makes the movie sing.  Bradley Cooper is also amazing in his portrayal of a likable but flawed guy with bipolar disorder.  The rest of the cast, particularly Robert Denero, are well suited for their supporting roles.

I confess I got more than a little choked up at the end.

Despite being in a genre I'm not particularly fond of, I liked this movie so much, I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",1374710400,,755,4.35

Great character development and incredible depth. The movie, in my opinion, strayed way too far from what made the book so spectacular. With chunks of plot completely left out, twisted about, or made shallow, it was about as satisfying as a fortune cookie - minus the fortune. Without reference to the book, I'm sure the movie quite capably stands on its own. Unfortunately, watching it after having recently read/listened to the book left me disappointed.",1374624000,,599,5.0

The script is wonderful and the acting was such that the movie worked in all areas.  I had not heard of the film when it was nominated for various Oscars, but now I see why it was nominated.  It mixes a serious topic with human in such a way that the viewer is given a lot to think about as one looks at those in our families and society.  This is a problem that is rampant and needs to be addressed.  I can't think of a better way to address it.

These two played off each other perfectly in this quirky look at Pat and Tiffany, living in Philadelphia, both a wee bit crazy (really), both having spousal issues, and both needing a friend that won't judge them.

There are some great side characters, too, including Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Pat's father and mother.

5174232,2,B008OGIPJA,"While films rarely stack up to the books they're made from, this translation was particularly disappointing.

Some of the most visual images the book inspired were left out of the film. The therapist leading Pat in an eagle chant--arms raised and hands twisting--generated a camaraderie that made sense of the personal relationship that developed between them.

The book's primary theme--a sane person having a heartbreak-catalyzed psychotic break and the comical and sad journey back--was undermined when Pat revealed that he had loved Tiffany the moment they met.

That said, there were some bright spots in the film. Tiffany's monologue justifying how Pat's absence from watching Eagles' games improved the team's performance was excellent. Bradley Cooper's depiction of a forlorn, lost soul was believable and far exceeded my epectations.

In short, the pivot from heartbreak to lovestruck was too abrupt, as was Cooper's recovery from social ineptitude. Instead of presenting a fresh perspective the film turned this story into a predictable Hollywood love story.",1374019200,,1068,5.533742331288344

5174237,4,B008OGIPJA,"David O. Russell is making a name for himself by taking terribly conventional scripts/plots and turning out remarkably original movies full of life and energy.  He did it first with ""Three Kings,"" but then again, and with more accolades with ""The Fighter,"" which on paper was just another movie about an underdog boxer, but on screen was fascinating, funny, and one of the best sports films to come along in years.  And now he's back with ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" and he's doing the same thing for the romantic-comedy-amongst-kooks genre.

Bradley Cooper plays a guy fresh out of a mental hospital after nearly beating his wife's lover to death.  He's trying hard to be better, and even harder to convince everyone else that he's better.  His friends hook him up with Jennifer Lawrence, who, since her cop husband died in a freak accident, has slept with nearly everyone in town.  The motives of his friends are questionable.  Are they trying to get him laid so that he'll forget about his ex-wife?  That's super sketchy, since Lawrence is clearly dealing with her own craziness and needs people around her who will protect her, not enable her.

But then it becomes clear that just about everyone in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is some kind of crazy. It's sort of the mirror image of ""Arrested Development.""  In that show, Jason Bateman thinks he's the only sane one surrounded by a bunch of lunatics, but really, he's just as nuts as everyone else.  Here, Bradley Cooper thinks he's the one with mental issues surrounded by normal people, but everyone else is just as insane as he is.

Take, for instance, his father, played by Robert De Niro.  He's a bookie and a passionate, superstitious Eagles fan.  He honestly seems to think that the way he holds a certain handkerchief has an effect on the outcome of the game.  De Niro believes that Cooper watching the game with him makes a difference. That's insane.  Betting on it is even more insane.  That's a weird pressure to put on somebody - I'm betting heavy because I believe you're good luck and the Eagles are going to win because you're at the game.  Not playing IN the game, AT the game.  You can't do anything REAL to help the team win the game, you can't take the field and catch a touchdown pass, so if they lose and you were there being good luck, what then?  You didn't do enough? Didn't do what enough? If my dad bet all he had on a  football game because he believed that my good luck presence was going to determine the game - me one out of 50,000 fans attending, 150,000 watching -- I would have a nervous breakdown right then and there.

Lawrence is the hero of the film because instead of resisting everyone's  craziness, she just meets them in it.  In the best sequence of the movies (and one of the best sequences in movies, period,)  instead of telling De Niro that he's insane to think that his son's relationship with her is detrimental to the Eagles, she just goes with it.  And she's done her research.  I love the way this whole sequence is filmed, directed and acted.  There are so many characters involved, really involved in this scene; there's so much energy to it.  The plot mechanics are pretty straight forward; you need to film a confrontation scene that ends with this crazy bet upon which the rest of the film will be predicated. But the way it's handled is so loose -- and frenetic -- that it really feels like a situation that just evolves into what it becomes. Nothing feels forced. And so a really implausible plot point -- the calling card of nearly all romantic comedies -- feels honestly believable.

All of ""Silver Linings Playbo0k"" feels messy, loose and thrown together.  At first glance, you'd think the director is hardly in control of what's going on here.  But on closer look, it becomes clear that this madness is by design.  For instance.  Russell uses the editing, and the score, to create a sense of things happening too fast, which I think is supposed to be how Cooper feels about the world - there are just too many things happening, too fast, both inside and outside of his head, for him to deal with them all.  If everything would just slow down a little, he might be all right.  But everything escalates.  On top of that, Russell gets great, fully invested performances from everyone involved.  That's no easy task, and I wonder what his secret is. Some of these actors, I've never seen them working this hard. Others, De Niro in particular, look like he just woke up from a long nap of acting in silly and stupid movies. I've stopped watching movies just because Robert De Niro is in them, but I'll hazard a guess - he hasn't been this invested since he directed himself in ""The Good Shepherd.""

This is a heck of a movie, and David O. Russell is a heck of a director, someone I'll definitely be watching in years to come.  His movies are alive in a way a lot of movies aren't, and they're really fun and intriguing to watch.",1374019200,,4935,4.5636363636363635

Very predictable and somehow the romance didn't ring true to me. If the movie had focused more on the main character's state of mind, it might have been more interesting, but instead his mental problems were just a superficial way to add the appearance of depth to yet another identical romantic comedy.

Bradley Cooper (is gorgeous!!)was good in this...he was on point when portraying the manic stage of bi-polar disorder and he needs more roles like this to show what a gifted actor he is.  Chris Tucker was also good.  Now as the parents...Jacki Weaver was great but Deniro??  He was fantastic and proved once again why he is one of the best actors in film. This movie though really belongs to Jennifer Lawrence.  I know she is young but she must be an old soul to be able to portray the emotions required of her.

The whole basis of the lead characters illness was changed and many more differences. The worst being the ending. I just can't say how terrible the ending was compared to the book.

5174387,4,B008OGIPJA,"A comedy with tension building towards a final ""dance"" has been done a couple of times in recent years with great results. Napoleon Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine. Small spoiler alert: the dance scene is beautifully shot and edited as it captures the performers point of view like few others I've seen. Also, within moments of finishing the dance, De Niros spontaneous advice to his son shows that he had more invested in his son than any parlay in play that evening. It's a perfect 5 minutes of film and that's all I'm going to say about it.",1373241600,,545,4.571428571428571
5174398,4,B008OGIPJA,"Performances were excellent.  Robert de Nero certainly deserved the Academy Award as best supporting actor, as did Jennifer Lawrence as best leading actress.

So much in today's movies is about special effects, but this relied on the story to carry the film, coupled with good acting performances.

The cost of the rental via Amazon Prime was beyond reasonable.  Where could we go to a movie theater and pay $5.00...$2.50 per ticket for two....be in the nice cool A/C of our home...no crowd....fabulous food...worked out great!  We highly recommend this film and would think it okay for maybe 9 on up.  A little cussing, but probably nothing that most kids haven't heard.  If you are a parent that are bothered if your child hears one cuss word and/or you are an adult who just cannot tolerate an off beat work...this is not for you.  Otherwise....try it!",1373241600,,718,4.546875

If you have someone in your family with a mental illness, you can definitely relate to the story. The story is serious, but has a lot of comic relief throughout. It really is a drama, comedy and love story all rolled into one. The acting is superb from the whole cast. You really can't go wrong with this movie.

I assumed it was going to be the typical hokey, predictable, mainstream manufactured garbage like 80% of all movies made today targeted at the mainstay soccer mom audience.  Stick a couple of popular celebs in there and viola.  My wife forced me to watch this, it was her turn to pick a movie, and I have to say this was excellent.  Who wants to see Bradley Cooper face anymore really?  But I'll tell you he wasn't annoying.  Good casting, good acting, nothing over done.  A tad predictable, but what isn't these days.  Even Robert Dinero, who jumped the shark on the meet the Fockers was good.  Highly recommend it.",1373155200,,698,4.564516129032258

Would that a swap for Winter's Bone were possible for Jennifer.  As for Bradley Cooper, even running around in a yard-size trash bag didn't make him as nuts as his dad.",1373068800,,385,4.907692307692308

5174440,4,B008OGIPJA,"Pat Solitano, played exceptionally well by Bradley Cooper, is bipolar and has just been released from a mental institution for violent episodes which have estranged him from his wife. Excelsior (ever upward) is one of the catch phrases used at the institution (along with ""silver linings"" - as in looking for) and both are frequently repeated during the film. Still thinking his marriage is salvageable, Pat is trying to put his life back together when he meets Tiffany Maxwell, who has been recently widowed and is also troubled emotionally. Tiffany is played by a 21 year old Jennifer Lawrence in a career defining performance...her Oscar was well deserved. In addition to trying to win back his wife, Pat also tries to mend fences with his father (played with usual excellence by Robert De Niro) who also has similar bipolar-type mental issues. Tiffany and Pat, through the medium of dance, help each other out...and the mutual assistance story becomes a love story...an exceptional love story. In addition to the principles, look for fine support performances from Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother; Julia Styles as Tiffany's sister, Veronica; and John Ortiz as Veronica's husband. This is one of those highly acclaimed films that certainly lives up to all the hype; and my only caveat is the distraction caused by pervasive profanity...the movie would have been so much more enjoyable to watch without it.",1373068800,,1405,5.086580086580087

5174445,1,B008OGIPJA,"Almost the entire movie was spent with a dialog of the main character making offensive statements to everyone,including those who really cared about him.

My friend who recommended it wondered if I might be too deep in grief myself to enjoy it.  But i absolutely loved it!  Watching these wild & wacky antics was very cathartic for me.  Moreover, i think it rings true with anyone who has suffered a deep loss.

However, the actors did a wonderful job, and a few of the changes in the movie were in the right direction. They gave the father a much more positive personality than in the book, so he was likeable.

It's a drama through and through so if you don't like that sort of film that it's all about ""Talk"" and no action then you might not have the patience for this.

LOVE HER!!  The other cast members are brilliant...Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker and others that will be familiar to you.

5174538,4,B008OGIPJA,"Cooper, Lawrence and De Niro make a great lead cast. It's not your run of the mill story or romantic comedy. It brings to mind Benny and Joon from a decade ago, but more real, raw, and relatable. It's got family dynamics and relationship truths, along with a little bit of dancing. The movie may hit home more so for people who have had a partner pass too soon, who are bipolar or have some uniqueness that sets them apart from society or their family, and it is to this audience that the movie speaks the most, though everyone will benefit from the message of hope, triumph self-acceptance, opening up and moving forward. Great for a weekend movie night. I'd buy it if it were $10 and I think it should be cheaper than a $5 rental.  I'd give it 4.5 stars, between ""like"" and ""love.""",1372636800,,783,4.363013698630137

5174602,1,B008OGIPJA,"Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for this? Silver Linings Playbook is the worst sequence of formulaic movie tropes I've seen in a long, long while. Of all the movies released in 2012, I could pick one out of a hat and it would be better than Silver Linings Playbook.

There is nothing original in this movie. It is flippant in places where it needs to be serious, it is trite in places where it needs to be original, and it is formulaic in places where it needs to be insightful. And the soundtrack is cloying.

Take the following: ""Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow. Minus the whore thing, for the most part."" Here is a line, bereft of verisimilitude, that is so ingratiating as to be nauseating. Set aside the annoyance that a serious actor could ever deliver such a line with a straight face (and Jennifer Lawrence can't keep one, so conscious of her adoring audience is she--I implore you to go back and look), but, ask yourself what kind of writer could put such a line to paper. That is what people are celebrating here.

I was able to leave without pausing when I needed to pee, having predicted the previous half dozen plot moves to my viewing partner--and come back to her report that, ""It's exactly what you said would happen"". It was once written by someone--I cannot recall whom at the moment--that a good story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that still surprises you. By logic, a bad story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that is entirely predictable. Silve Linings Playbook is infuriating in its predictability.

The problem is not the arc of romantic comedies. The problem is not Hollywood's over-use of The Magic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG's can be charming, done right). The problem is the way in which emotions play out in life. Emotions are sometimes predictable and sometimes not, but they matter to the person having them, and that is a matter worth taking seriously. This movie was not only predictable and dismissive, but it was consistently so all along the way to its inevitable and entirely prosaic denouement.

This movie could have been saved (For contrast, Juno, just as nauseating, could never have been saved) with better writing, a cast that showed up to act and without the tortured football metaphor. But I'm the odd man out here. I see that the TomatoMeter has it at 92%. If this is how people see themselves and their romantic involvements, I pity them. And if this movie offers some emollient to those couples who need convincing that they are not in the wrong relationship... it still sucks.",1372377600,9,2567,4.657836644591612
5174603,1,B008OGIPJA,"WTF?  It was one of the worst movies we've ever seen.  We couldn't even finish it.  Nothing made sense.  Seemed like it was arranged haphazardly.  JL is not that great.

5174622,5,B008OGIPJA,"I thought this was an excellent movie with great performances, and particularly liked that it was something different. Bradley Cooper earns the praise he received for this role, playing a man with mental health issues returning home after being institutionalized, and trying to win his wife back and start a new life. Jennifer Lawrence is even better as a young widow with stability issues herself, who manipulates him into participating in a dance competition with her.  Every scene between them is spot on in tone, dialogue and depth. The supporting cast is excellent and entertaining as well. It manages to mix poignancy and humor with dark truth, and creates an entertaining and even heartwarming story.",1372291200,,707,5.147826086956521

Formally, it is a sort of a mess, starting out as a melodrama and shifting half-way through to a romantic comedy.  The best I can say is it's not boring.  Plot is mostly not believeable and characters, likewise. (Plot and characters do not have to be believable so long as there is some resonance for either in the real world.)

It's a sad stigma and one that this film beautifully overwrites. People are broken and relationships are broken, yet in that brokenness, something like ""dancing"" can mend wounds and bring two lives together.

Jennifer Lawrence is a gem and Bradley Cooper shines. Great movie. A+",1371513600,,431,5.246376811594203
5174814,5,B008OGIPJA,"Outstanding.  Argo may have won the best picture oscar but this one was a real hoot for entertainment and IMO the best of the year.  Lawrence (best actress), Cooper, DeNiro et al were all great.  Couldn't stop laughing and enjoyed the romantic aspect of two very flawed individuals getting together and on each other's case unmercifully.  Typical Philadelphia which must be the Hebrew word for rude.  One of the very few films I watch repeatedly.",1371513600,,446,4.8933333333333335

5174816,4,B008OGIPJA,"Overall the movie is a great Romcom.  Has layer of plot that show how Bradley Coopers character became so twisted in his emotions.  Would have been nice to see as much story attributed to Jennifer Lawrence's character.  It's also a very contrived Hollywood story that goes just how you expect, everyone wins and no twists at all.",1371513600,,329,4.7368421052631575
5174817,3,B008OGIPJA,"First of all, Jennifer Lawrence is great in this. It's an alright movie but? Academy? Ok... I guess if you say so. Then again, I despise The Hangover and look at how well that does, so perhaps Bradley Cooper pulls 'em in. It's about a rather unlikeable guy and his incredibly OCD father who obsesses over sports. Maybe that is also why I didn't care for this film and I'm being biased? If you are looking for a rom-com, I would say this fits that bill. If you like a guy who seems prickish for a good 3/4ths of the movie before redeeming himself in some manner - by all means add this to your queue. In fact, if that is your type of movie, watch Buffalo 66 it's 100 times better than this one. The one redeeming thing about Silver Linings Playbook is Jennifer Lawrence's character. Well acted and brilliantly pulling the other characters in the movie together while helping Bradley Cooper get his head out of his 4th point of contact - she brings a lot to the table and made watching a sports movie with grumpy, typical guys more bearable. Not really one I'll clamor to view again anytime soon.",1371513600,3,1094,4.394088669950739

Fantastic!",1371427200,,250,4.319148936170213
5174819,5,B008OGIPJA,"This movie is really outstanding.  Funny, poignant, inspiring.  Also, great acting -- kind of amazed by Bradley Cooper's performance and Jennifer Lawrence is great too (in fact the whole movie was really well-cast).

Highly recommend it, especially if you are going through a rough time, and the despair/lack of hope is catching up with you. This movie will leave you with newfound optimism.",1371427200,,391,5.174603174603175
5174820,4,B008OGIPJA,"I liked this movie and I never rooted for two people to get together more than I did in this movie but I feel that it fell short of all the hype. Yes, it was a unique take on a romantic comedy but it was still just a romantic comedy. It didn't stray too far from the typical Hollywood formula. I do think that Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro gave spectacular performances. I thought the woman who played his mother was great too. I was shocked, however, at how flat Jennifer Lawrence's acting was. She was the main reason I wanted to see the movie. I guess it just shows how unseasoned she actually is when put up against greats like Deniro.",1371427200,,642,4.270491803278689
5174821,3,B008OGIPJA,I didn't like the depiction of mental illness in this.  It didn't seem realistic and I don't see how finding a girlfriend can solve mental illness.  NOt one of my favorites.  Wish I had seen it before I bought it,1371427200,,212,4.25

A good friend shared his appreciation of Jennifer Lawrence. So yeah, I rented it on Amazon, with pretty much zero idea of the plot. So a Philadelphia guy has his mental problems, and gets out of the looney bin after almost killing his wife's lover, and moves back in with Mom & Dad. Dad is a relapsed bookie played by Robert de Niro. Dad becomes needy as he wants Pat (Bradley Cooper) around to watch the Eagles games with him; he believes Pat gives him good luck. Mutual friends introduce Pat to Tiffany (Lawrence), another nutcase. There is immediate attraction, but Pat is still obsessed with his wife. Tiffany persuades Pat to enter a dance concert with her. Love is sublimated, until the end. You can guess. Yep, tears in spite of yourself. Well done.",1371340800,,898,4.383233532934132

Helping Pat's recovery is Tiffany . . . a woman he meets who is battling demons of her own.

I'm a psychologist so I really appreciated the realistic portrayal of mental illness in this film.  It does a great job of humanizing those with mental health issues and depicting the obstacles they encounter as they struggle to get better.",1371340800,,615,4.513513513513513

I understand human frailties and what pain we can suffer in our losses of the heart.
But, life has a silver lining.  You just have to believe in that, and look for it.  If you are lucky, it will find you.

5174845,3,B008OGIPJA,"I read the book.  It was good, more below.  The movie was nominated for all sorts of awards, so I watched it.  Jennifer Lawrence completely takes over this movie, in a good way.  She and Robert De Niro's performances are the reasons to watch this movie.  I loved Robert De Niro's subtle depiction of his own mental illness; clearly the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  I found this very realistic and true to my own life experience. The only puzzlement to me is how she fell in love with that dweebie simp, Pat, who is clearly still obsessed with his ex. Though in the book as in the movie, Tiffany falls for Pat almost immediately. It had to be his rockin' abs. Bradley Cooper, a fine actor in other vehicles, is too old to play Pat, for one thing.  The age difference between the actors distracted me here. I think what the movie does best, like the book, is show the complexity and reality of dealing with mental illness, both from the family's and the individual's standpoint. I loved the families depicted in this movie; they adjust to the reality of dealing with their family members' illness and support them. Oh, I absolutely hated the ending, with Nicki showing up at the dance competition.  Hated it.  The book was much better here.  Watch Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone instead. Now THAT is an Academy Award standard movie.",1371254400,2,1348,4.579166666666667

This movie is emotionally charged and moved me indescribably. I think everyone has a ""crazy"" misunderstood side to them. Love makes us crazy and do crazy things. (I don't like using the term crazy, since I think it's politically incorrect.) What I mean by crazy here is something that makes us tick. I related to Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) and their struggles and perseverance to see the silver lining. I think everyone can relate to these characters, since we are all at one point or another trying to see the silver lining in an adversity. Everything from the script to the plot was beautifully executed. The actors' performance was nothing short of amazing. I was instantly immersed into the story and didn't want it to end. I'm the type who gets restless and can't sit through an hour and a half movie, but with this one, I remained glued to my seat. This movie is worth your time and money.

5174876,3,B008OGIPJA,"Review - Silver Linings Playbook

What kind  of romance is to be expected between two freaks?

David O Russell's 2012  movie ""Silver Linings Playbook"" - a romantic comedy-drama film starring  Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and  Jacki Weaver - is  a rather simple but fresh addition to Hollywood's endless list of  romantic movies.

 After beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, Pat Jr.  (Bradley Cooper) is institutionalised and diagnosed with bipolar  disorder. He loses his wife, house and job and has to move back in with  his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and his  father Pat Sr. (Robert De  Niro) in Philadelphia. Determined to get his previous life back - with a  first step of trying to contact his wife - he finds help in Tiffany  (Jennifer Lawrence), who is also reeling from a personal loss. Pat and Tiffany build a complicated friendship comprehending love and hate, which is based on the selfish try to receive help from the other to  achieve their individual goals. The process in doing so might still  affect the targeted goal.

Despite the  intention to create a movie which unites romance, as well as comedy and  drama, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" does not successfully achieve a  homogenous mixture where all genres involved reach their climax. Instead  the whole plot is lacking in suspense. Nevertheless the acting of  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding. They manage to  embody the role of two mentally disordered young people, who try to cope  with life their way, incomparably well. All in all not a must have in  your DVD shelves but still worth watching.",1370995200,,1612,4.936329588014981

5174892,4,B008OGIPJA,"David O. Russell's comedy drama ""Silver Linings Playbook"" starts with a Philadelphia mental health facility, from which a thirty-something former teacher Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is now released. Determined to win back his wife Nikki who has run away, Pat agrees to be a dance partner of recently widowed Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who promises him to deliver his message to Nikki. By the way, Tiffany has lost her job for having sex with everyone in the office.

Not many people would think of making a romantic comedy involving two troubled souls, pro football betting and dancing competition. Based on a book by Matthew Quick, David O. Russell (director of ""Three Kings"" and a philosophical comedy ""I Heart Huckabees"") tactfully handles the subject matter that could be easily coarse and offensive.

The greatest credit for making this tricky premise work goes to the actors. Bradley Cooper (Oscar nominated) and Jennifer Lawrence (who won Oscar) both deserve every accolade heaped on them, and so do the supporting actors, especially Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver (both nominated for Oscar) as Pat's concerned parents. When was the last time Robert De Niro was Oscar nominated? (Answer: ""Cape Fear,"" 1991.)

The storyline itself is a little conventional in the second half, and some may want to see more of Chris Tucker, whose character seems underused. Perhaps the film is slightly overrated, but still ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is refreshing, edgy and entertaining and above all is a great love story.",1370908800,,1528,5.178137651821863

Life will be a lot easier.

I can see how Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for her performance. Absolutely brilliant how she acted like Tiffany would (I think!).

The story and the way it revealed the ups and downs (downs and ups) of bi-polar and all those codependent, brought me to giggles and tears and a side-long look to my husband, who looked back, and nodded...He knows I KNOW these characters, I love them, and just like this movie will show you, inside the wacky, is a deeply feeling heart and deserving of love and compassion just like one who is 'normal' (I chagrin saying 'normal').

An interesting combination of qualities: Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.

SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny, and the lead characters are such stereotypical bipolars. In either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake. As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone, along with the society they create and inhabit, is nuts, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.

The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does-- it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--see the line I've used as my title--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is riveting (and I'll admit, pretty funny).

In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.

*Many obviously disagree with me on whether or not this film is truly funny. I'm just calling it as I see it.",1370822400,,1690,4.833910034602076
5174907,3,B008OGIPJA,This movie was highly rated by many and my expectations were high.  But the basic message and idea was not all that unusual and I could only relate moderately well with the characters.

Believable choices by characters, but the process of change by Pat(Cooper) was so subtle as to be non existent, and made the ending feel like it belonged in a different movie. Tacking on a ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending did not do justice to to the work done earlier in the movie.  Sadly, the love of a difficult woman can't cure bipolar disorder.

Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are appealing actors and enjoy their work, thought most all the other actors were good. Regarding story, I understood why the Bradley character fell in love with Jennifer, she's young and beautiful and spent most of the film trying to engage and interact with him; wasn't clear in the story why she fell in love with him; he showed some kindness to her when he defended her honor, but thought story could have shown more the quality of his character when he was with her.  After Bradley's character begins taking his medication, he is kinder and better able to connect with his family, but Jennifer doesn't witness that.  He begins the story as a young man with mental problems, almost but not quite stable, initially refusing medication, jobless, living at home with his parents after leaving a mental institution; the story begins with him in the institution, and being sprung by his mother before he is really ready.  Story doesn't really explain why a gorgeous young woman would fall for him; he's handsome, he's somewhat kind to her, but the romance is not proved strongly enough in the story - she enters the story caring for him, and the story never explains why.  As I said, act 3 saves it, and the tender scenes between Robert DeNiro and Bradley's father and son help sell Bradley's character as a good guy, and other parts of the story help that portrayal as well (he finally begins taking meds after a wrestling match/fight with his parents), but I think it would have been better had she not entered the story already liking him; left the audience out of the loop on her character motivation.  3 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.",1370736000,,1827,4.62037037037037
5174929,3,B008OGIPJA,"From the ads I was expecting something more lighthearted. This is very well acted, but pretty dark - both leads are very damaged folks and their inability to function normally, while key to the plot - sometimes gets a lot more attention than the story.  The characters are revealed, but they do not develop.  That being said, they are very interesting people in a tough situation making the best of what life has handed them, and their struggle is very well presented.  So, watch it and expect it to be good, but don't expect it to be cute or heartwarming or anything the ads for this movie indicated.",1370736000,,601,4.546296296296297

I was constantly thinking ""Oh my God, this movie is crazy & weird"", throu out the whole movie. Even when it ended, I liked how it ended but was still thinking to myself ""that movie was crazy weird"", & not sure if I liked it or not. And this is the strangest thing about this movie... It IS crazy and weird, nothing like anything I have ever seen (althou when I thought about it - it's kinda like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" - that kinda vibe). Then I found myself constantly thinking about the movie, & the characters...& kinda ""missing them""! I have a whole new respect & love for Bradley Cooper, & Jennifer Laurence (who I really don't know). This movie ends up making you wish you knew these people in real life (as CRAZY as they were), & could continue being a part of their lives.",1370649600,,868,4.234939759036145

5174952,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is simply a terrific film, with Bradley Cooper at his best, Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her performance, and legendary Robert de Niro as the father, among others in a very, very good cast.  The highly respected director David O. Russell has a son in real life with similar challenges as some of the leads, and you can watch for the son in brief scenes as a neighbor's youngster hoping to record events, documentary style, on his smart phone.  Russell's best known film before this was the award winning ""The Fighter"" which garnered Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.  (Not bad!)

We saw this again last night, very good Blu Ray print bought here on amazon.com, and liked it even better the second time!  The director's unusual film style and great dialogue help make this film what it is.  Anyone whose life has been affected by a dysfunctional family (whose hasn't?) or mental illness in any form would especially find this uplifting film touching.

In special features, the film festival interviews with the actors and the people behind the camera are very revealing, and interesting, and especially fun for film buffs.

5174957,4,B008OGIPJA,"This is a masterpiece of deluded thinking.  Psych majors want to figure out what is wrong with them should watch this movie.

Dad is OCD and superstitious, making juju to help the Philadelphia Eagles win.  Apparently the defective gene has passed from father to son, as Dad is banned from Eagles' stadium for some sort of unnamed violence.  In the same way the son has a restraining order against, well, everyone, including his wife.

Mom tries to follow what she believes a proper wife should do, but it's futile.  She's overwhelmed by trying to fulfill her wifely duties while bailing out her son who has been in a mental institution for 8 months.  Turns out he's bipolar.  She copes as best as she can.  She's probably the only sane one in the movie.

The son's deluded thinking is that he can make amends with his ex-wife and they will be all cozy again.  Ain't gonna happen.

He meets a young widow whose impossible dream is to win a dance contest.

I didn't think that either of the lead characters were sympathetic or likable although I do like the actors who played them.  I conclude that it was a fault either of the writing or of the directing.  Tellingly, I found the most interesting and attractive character in the film was the alienated soon-to-be-EX-Wife!

Classic expressions and family dynamics that everyone could possibly relate to.  Bradley Cooper should have one the award, but it will be a while before Daniel Day Lewis will be upstaged. Jennifer Lawrence was just simply the best!!!!  I wonder if she was basically having a ball just making that movie. And, Robert Di Nero doesn't let you down either.  His character was fabulous.

I saw it again via subscription service when it was released on DVD to refresh my memory and see if it would withstand the test of time and be worthy of purchase.  It was.  I watched it again last night.

If you like Jennifer Lawrence, you will love her after seeing her in this film.  She deserved her Oscar.  If you can barely tolerate Bradley Cooper (like myself), you will be very impressed and give him another shot after seeing the Hangover films.  He deserved his nomination.  If you enjoy Robert De Niro, you will appreciate his acting skills all the more, and he deserved his nomination as well.  I won't give away any of the plot, and I highly recommend checking it out for yourself.  A few times.

I'm not usually a fan of chick flicks or romantic comedies but the unique premise and rave review ""silver linings"" got had me curious. Not only did it live up to expectations, it was easily the best romantic film I've seen, partly because it explored the romance in a realistic context and acknowledged a sweet family dynamic as well. The blend of poignancy and humor is very well balanced and the performances are phenomenal. Jennifer Lawrence absolutely deserved all her awards, but Bradley Cooper was also a real surprise, he shattered the ""eye candy"" or blandly interesting attractive lead mold he usually occupies and gave a very convincing and vulnerable portrayal as a man suffering from what can be a debilitating illness. The supporting roles were also incredibly well played, there was not a single weak link in this cast and it was refreshing to see Robert De Niro in a role that matched his caliber.

I like movies that leave me with a happy, satisfied, cheery geeling/mood. This movie didn't do that for me. Jennifer Lawrence carried this movie on her shoulder's in my opinion. Good on her for such a solid performance.

5175000,1,B008OGIPJA,"... well, maybe the silver lining is that you can almost be certain, any other movie you ever watch, won't match the fail that is jam-packed in this one.

My friend, she wanted to rent this movie and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Of-Pi/dp/B00BSBT8M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Of Pi</a>. So we rented both movies. To be honest, I didn't want to watch either one. However, to my surprise, Life of Pi was pretty decent. This one, I can't really put to words how bad it really is. The acting is weak, the direction is horrid, the dialog goes from pedestrian to down right crummy, the casting ... well.

My friend, she fell asleep during the movie. I tried to watch through it, giving it a chance to redeem itself, but it was hopeless.

If you like crap movies, you'll enjoy this one. Otherwise, this isn't even worth the $1.20 rental from the kiost at your local supermarch.",1370217600,6,926,5.119205298013245

Despite a rather unusual plot the actors did a spot on job portraying their characters - well done everyone.
All in all it was not something I would watch again but I did enjoy watching the actors and tried to get into the story but found myself having trouble accepting the idea we are all as screwed up as the main characters.

On the plus side, Robert DeNiro and Jennifer Lawrence (who is generally unimpressive, in my book) were both really excellent in their roles (esp. DeNiro). It just felt like the kind of movie that was trying to be deep/intellectual/touching...but was actually pretty dull. It's a bit of an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" situation where it seems like everyone is supposed to say how great it is b/c it makes you look non-intellectual or not deep enough if you don't like it, but I'll put it out there: this movie just isn't in the arena of truly deep, thoughtful, artistic films (even the popular ones).",1370131200,9,1008,4.700564971751413

5175024,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook is a 2012 Romantic Comedy directed by David O. Russell.  Starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, (along with a sensational supporting cast), it's a story of mental illnesses and improbable love.  I thought it was beautiful.

This was my first experience with Jennifer Lawrence and I her performance here was incredible.  Brooding and explosive, she was an ambient, unmitigated element who somehow also brought real humor to the film - I was blown away by that.  And Bradley Cooper was similarly effective.  Stack on Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, (Tucker nailed it), and it's a win across the board.  I'm so pleased I opted to sit this through.

Silver Linings is quirky and it's moving.  I laughed often.  I think there's also some tragedy in what's offered here and that's valuable.  I've suffered through too many relationship comedies and it's about time someone broke the mold and started taking the genre seriously.  It's not that I've ever been opposed to them, it's just been so rare to land on any with real substance.  But there is most certainly substance here and it's instilled some faith in me.  The next time I'm walking the rental wall at my local movie store, you can bet I'll slow down for the films I used to run past.  I've been reborn and my wife will likely be very happy about that...

If I had one complaint, however, it would be the blatant adverts purchased by Apple.  The ipod situations, (and there were a few), were distractingly tacky and did some damage.  At least in my opinion they did.  A woman mocking people for not owning the product, plugging the product into a futuristic wall dock, the product being gifted, the giftee gushing over THAT, videos watched on the product, the product being danced too, etc..  No thank you.

But I do recommend the film and do so highly.  ipods aside, it's pretty great and absolutely worth what they're asking.

Thank you for your time.

And the movie itself was well-done and very good. But not great. Everyone else was very good, as well. I don't think the other people deserved best actor/actress nominations. Bradley Cooper, maybe. He was very good. But not De Niro and the woman who played her mother. They did a great job; but I don't think it was worth an Oscar nom.

Basically, in my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence made this movie what it was, and all the buzz about this movie was because her performance was so great it made the entire movie seem better than it actually was.

This movie will make you laugh and does a silver lining in the end.,1369958400,,330,4.875
5175052,5,B008OGIPJA,"With so many movies being released these days it's hard to decide what movie to rent or watch. If you have a particular favorite genre you usually lean that direction. If you hear from a friend you might use that to decide. Most of us rarely step out of our comfort zone though. Make a decision to do that tonight and rent SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.

Forget the cover or ads, this is not a romantic comedy. There is romance and there are some funny moments, but the heart of this film revolves around mental illness. Not in the usual depressing sort of way but in a way that opens up discussion about the topic and that makes you realize you can have problems but still find hope.

Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer whose mother gets him released from a mental institution after 8 months inside. Pat went there after he returned home early one day to find his wife in the shower with a colleague and attacking him. This was the trigger that brought about the realization that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.

Once home we get a glimpse of where Pat's problems may have begun. His father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is a book operator who is slightly OCD to say the least. Problems in the past between son and father are history but at the same time affect much of what happens in the present. Trying to rebuild bridges and solve those problems makes up part of this story.

Pat is trying to change his life all in the hopes of getting back with his ex-wife, who has a restraining order out against him. He runs, works out and is reading the syllabus of books she recommends to her students. She wanted him to lose weight, to be better read and to find a way to enjoy life. Now he's trying in hopes of their reuniting.

Pat's friend Ronnie invites him to dinner and there introduces him to his wife's sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany has problems of her own with her husband having died a few months earlier and having just lost her job.  The two seem at first to but heads but eventually a friendship begins to flourish when Tiffany suddenly shows up to run alongside Pat while he jogs.

As a bond slowly forms between the two and friendship blossoms, Pat remains focused on his ex-wife.  Tiffany continues to try and build on their friendship, eventually agreeing to get a letter to Pat's ex in return for one favor. She wants him to help her by being her dance partner in a ballroom dancing competition. Pat agrees, anything to bring his ex back.

The nice part about this film is the chemistry between the two actors in the leads as well as the supporting cast that surrounds them. There isn't a wasted moment of film used in the telling of this story and you find yourself rooting not only for the main characters but everyone involved here. The icing on the cake is the slow development of the characters rather than the rushed feeling most movies present these days. Instead of Pat or Tiffany suddenly becoming a different ball of emotions, their changes develop as the story unfolds making it a more complete and realistic film.

The charm of this film is that you can't help but love these characters as portrayed because they seem so real. You want the best for them, you want them to succeed and until the final moments of the film you're just not quite sure if that will happen or not. It also provides a platform to leap from if there is someone with a mental illness in your real life. The topic has always seemed taboo but films like this will make it easier to approach someone or to open up and say ""I have a problem.""

The highest praise I can offer for this film is to say I think it should have taken the Oscar for best picture. It is a movie I felt like I could sit back and watch all over again just as soon as it finished. Finding a movie like that these days is rare indeed.",1369958400,7,3822,4.391796322489392

Jennifer Lawrence was a star in her role, with problems of her own, yet helping Bradley to have a more normal life by channeling his focus and energy on her and dance.

That having been said, in my opinion, all of the Oscar hoopla over this film was a result the Academy's effort to bring a mainstream, date night film into the mix. Seeking a younger demographic. Best picture candidate it is not.  Seems contrived, unimaginative and the dialogue is full of filler.  Jennifer, however, at least makes the film watchable.",1369872000,4,456,4.734177215189874

There is a lot of humor in the book because we hear Pat's inner thoughts and the conversations he

5175125,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook (released Nov/12)stars,among others,Bradley Cooper as Pat,Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany,Robert De Niro as Pat Sr.,Jacki Weaver as Dolores and Chris Tucker as Danny. This is a quirky,crazy tale of a man dealing with a terrible bi-polar disorder and who ultimately wins his struggle against it. In the process it reunites his family and creates and new life for himself,independent of his past phobias.
Pat is being sprung from the local psychiatric facility by his mother,who is taking a risk doing so. He has been in the institution for eight months,has skipped his meds and while wants his freedom is of two minds about it(no pun intended).He was originally put into the facility for beating up a co worker having sex with his wife,whom he caught in the act. His wife left him but he still harbours thoughts that it can all be worked out again and returned to the way it was.
Back at home his father(DeNiro) also has mixed feelings of being reunited with his son,whom his wife didn't tell. His father is a sports fanatic and overly superstitious when it comes to his team. He seems to feel that Pat brings him and his team luck by just them being together watching the games. One evening Pat attends a dinner at a friends house and it is there he meets a young lady(Tiffany),also with some issues that need attending to. She is outspoken and says what she feels,but Pat also has his similar quirky ways. The two leave the dinner early when Tiffany just HAS to go. The conversation home is awkward at best,but a spark has been lit between the two which will grow brighter as the movie winds its way to the end.
Pat has been working out to get in shape for a return to his ex,whom he writes a letter to and gives to Tiffany to give to her. Pat will find out the truth eventually,but Tiffany writes a response to Pat herself,which Pat falls for in the short term. But in order for Pat to even get the letter delivered in the first place,Tiffany makes Pat enter a dance competition with her. The two practice and practice. During this time Pat has more than a few bad spells with his parent's and the local police, because he refuses to take his meds. His father bets big on his team against an old friend,and loses a big sum. When Pat comes home from dance practice his father is beside himself,blaming Pat for his misfortune. Tiffany arrives and tells Pat's father in no uncertain terms it was not Pat's fault. In fact she goes on in great detail to tell him his team won more times when she and Pat were together. This gets the father to thinking she is right and he makes a double or nothing bet wit his friend. The friend raises his proposition to include Pat and Tiffany getting at least a 5 out of 10 rating in their dance contest.
The pressure is on both Pat,his father and Tiffany,who has fallen for Pat but who keeps whingeing on about his ex. The night of the contest arrives. Pat's father's team has won there series and now it is up to Pat and Tiffany. However Pat's ex actually shows up and Tiffany figure's she will lose Pat after it is all over. She has a couple of vodka's
to stiffen her resolve and they both go on. They know they're entirely out of their league but they give it their best. The two receive a five rating and Pat's father's bet is won. Pat has a confidential word with his ex and Tiffany rushes off broken hearted. Pat catches up with her,as he obviously has told his ex he has fallen for Tiffany. The film ends as Pat and Tiffany are at Pat's home enjoying everyone's company,including their own. Pat is back on his meds and is doing fine.
This is certainly a heart warming tale,on top of the obvious look into mental illness. One also sees many characteristics in other characters,especially Pat's father who definitely has OCD,that could apply to many of the viewers of this film. Mental illness can sometimes be a subjective thing. Lawrence nicely plays Tiffany as a hard nosed woman,who admits to a variety of dalliances in her past,who has many issues and almost becomes a stalker to poor Pat. And I must say I don't know who corralled,roped and hog tied Chris Tucker,but this is the most under played performance I have ever seen him give in ANY film. And I liked it immensely. I know Lawrence received a statue for her performance but....why? Cooper is the real and central star here and if anyone deserved an OSCAR it was him. But to tell the truth,I don't believe there was ANY OSCAR performances in this film at all. The Academy decisions re the handing out of their prizes has baffled me over and over again for many a year now.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette.
All in all a delightful but quirky look at mental illness with a stellar cast. Highly recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1369612800,,4820,4.4971493728620295
5175126,3,B008OGIPJA,"My wife had wanted to see this for the longes time, she had read the book. Mostly she felt she was a disappointed viewer because of how the movie's story departed from the book's story. I having not read the book didn't feel it was a super great movie on it's own. Clearly slapped two people hot on peoples tongues, on a bad adaptation of a very good book. Two edgier lesser know actresses woud have done much better in these roles. And staying true to the book's story would have allowed some more edgy people to be cast.",1369612800,,522,4.282828282828283
5175127,3,B008OGIPJA,"The most frustrating thing about this movie for me was the thought of how good it could have been if they left out all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s, especially when it came to the lead female role (of course she likes beer, thinks sex with women is hot, and does one of the most overdone Hollywood moves of slapping the man across the face).
Also, if you are like me and have a family member with mental illness and you've dealt with the reality of this...you really need to separate that reality and how this movie portrays mental illness in order to enjoy the movie.  If you are able to do that, the movie is enjoyable to watch.  I do not see at all though how it was considered award-worthy.  I expected so much more from it because I read of all the awards but when I watched it I couldn't figure out what about it deserved an award. If they would have had the conviction to make the movie about mental illness and put more emotional depth and honesty into it, I could understand awards.  But this movie didn't go there, it was mental illness light complete with Hollywood ending.  I like Jennifer Lawrence, but I didn't think her acting was anything special in this role.  I felt it stayed on the surface a little too much, but it's also a matter of that's what the script called for.  I think she would have been capable of going a lot deeper in a believable way if the script had called for that but it didn't.

If you are offended by foul language, this has plenty of it.  Minimal sex/nudity...nothing to make a person squirm.  A brief shower nudity scene from the rear that was relative to the scene and during the dancing competition there are a couple revealing outfits but it's very brief and if you've ever watched Dancing with the Stars it's tame by comparison.",1369612800,5,1775,4.41717791411043
5175128,4,B008OGIPJA,This was a pretty good show.  I liked the 2 main characters and supporting roles were also well done.  Not sure if it's worth 5 bucks but the wife saw a preview and wanted to give it a watch.  I always compare it to going out to a movie and of course it's much cheaper to watch at home with my own popcorn!,1369612800,,306,3.8253968253968256

If you've read the book already: try to have an open mind and TRY to enjoy it.

If you haven't read the book: watch the movie and then read the book (I know EVERYONE says this but it really is WAY BETTER than the movie!!!)",1369526400,,456,4.290697674418604

5175144,5,B008OGIPJA,"I loved this movie on so so many levels. The characters; everyone knows, lives, or relates to a character in this movie. It is the view inside the head of, for some people, themselves. The obsessive need to have something tangible and real to hold on to, or the absolute loss of control when there is nothing there to keep you anchored. It is all here: life in its messy, beautiful, crazy, insane, loving self. Finding the true meaning in what emotions are supposed to look and feel like, to allow oneself to feel them, process, and see them for what they are, not what you misunderstand them to be. It was a lovely movie, heart wrenching and soul fulfilling at the same time.",1369526400,4,676,4.459677419354839
5175145,3,B008OGIPJA,"Finally, a movie that is better than the book. I read the book and it was okay, but the film was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence well deserved that Oscar.

5175147,5,B008OGIPJA,Mental illness impacts a huge number of families and needs to have the stigma removed so more peoplle can get help to live the lives they deserve.  Why is it easier to admit to a family member being a substance abuser (a choice) than to admit to a family member with mental illness (not a choice)?  I know this is a generalization and the issues often go hand in hand.  So see the movie and experience what a lot of families deal with daily.  It's heart warming and a sweet change from the pairing of 'mental illness' and some of the horrific headlines of the past few years.,1369440000,,575,4.296296296296297
5175148,5,B008OGIPJA,It was a great story and very well written movie. I recommend this movie for couples to watch.  I just wish that it was not 5.99 to watch on HD.,1369440000,,144,3.8
5175149,5,B008OGIPJA,This movie was everything I hope it would be. I'd wanted to see it for a while but never got around to it. Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved the Oscar. She was amazing and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of someone with Bipolar disorder was very realistic and heartfelt. Loved it and plan on buying it on Bluray so I can watch it time and again!,1369440000,,344,4.476190476190476
5175150,3,B008OGIPJA,"Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Cooper and Lawrence were pretty good in their characterizations. Having said that, however, I'm glad I didn't pay for it in the theater. DeNiro as a work-from-home bookie making bets with the big boy like they were pals? Please. And what was that dancing thing? I found that totally unbelievable and the score they got way too convenient. It would have worked better if they had stuck with the mental health issues.",1369440000,,452,4.734177215189874

5175152,5,B008OGIPJA,"In a ho-hum year for American cinema, Silver Linings Playbook gleams out of the dull woodwork as a modest film about people with modest ambitions, told at such a painfully honest level that it rises above as the best film of 2012.

The straightforward narrative, of a middle-aged man living with his parents and dealing with bipolar disorder, is enhanced through superb performances and powerful imagery. Bradley Cooper (who I'm usually not a fan of) giving a daring and moving performance as the protagonist, Jennifer Lawrence as the heartbreaking but electrifying heroine, and Robert De Niro as the well-intentioned but pathetic father lead the extraordinary cast in this tragicomedy. All three start off the film recovering from bad places in their lives, and try to build them back up.

Reconstruction proves difficult, emphasized in moments like Cooper's character moving home, seeing his brother's picture hanging on the wall while his own has been taken down and is leaning on a table. Lawrence's character (in one of several memorable monologues) tells of having to constantly give all of herself, only to receive nothing back. While the circumstances the characters face are more extreme than most of us will face in our lifetimes, they hint at positions we have all had to grapple with, in varying degrees of questioning one's own self-worth.

This film all seems to take place within several square miles. The characters' dreams are not impossible ones. The biggest ambition seems to be getting a 5 out of 10 at a dance competition, an underwhelming feat that provides one of the film's biggest laughs. Yet despite the understated attributes in the content of the film, the final product and emotional impact are profound and powerful, giving audiences one of the most rewarding and moving comedies in recent years.",1369440000,,1826,5.1003344481605355
5175153,5,B008OGIPJA,"This film was a fun time but respectful of people with mental illnesses. The film makes a good point: we are all a little ""crazy"" at times. We need to have patience with one another. Cooper is such a hottie and I am a Jennifer Lawrence fan for sure now.",1369440000,,253,4.08

5175158,4,B008OGIPJA,"Let say you had a Philly guy, a regular Philly guy, a regular Philly guy from one of its Little Italy neighborhoods. You know a guy who would root himself hoarse at a Phillies' game, or for the Flyers, or the `76ers (forget U/Penn though) and would go absolutely bonkers (maybe I sure reserve the use of that would here), would get heated up a lot, okay, at an Eagles football game. A guy who would, maybe, know how to make use of a good buffalo wings recipe or the secrets of a good place to get a good cheese and steak submarine sandwich. See a regular Philly guy, okay. Regular except for a little, uh, mental problem, a bi-polar problem, a little problem that got to be a big problem when his ever-lovin' wife proved unfaithful to him, as some wives will, proved unfaith though maybe because he spent just a little too much time cheering on those sports teams and not enough time being, well, being a well-rounded modern man. And our regular Philly guy went a little overboard in reaction to that treachery and wound up in a mental institution, complete with ""meds"" to calm him down. Oh yah, and despite those quirky little characteristics he is a voracious reader, a cowboy intellectual (although perhaps I should also reserve the word cowboy as well). Either way keep that reader thing under your hat since ""real"" Philly guys are too busy to read.

Let's say while our regular Philly guy, Pat to give him a name, was getting well (and not getting within shouting distance of his wife under penalty of another stretch, maybe some prison time the next time) and trying to make himself worthy of his wife's affections when she comes along. The she in question being another of the world's waif, Tiffany, who has her own set of, uh, mental problems but who came on board to try to get Pat through his rough spots on the road to reuniting with his wife.

And let's say that Ms. Tiffany is, well, kind of screwy, kind of outdoes Pat in the screwy department. At least for a while. On the face of it one regular Philly guy (albeit with those little problems mentioned above), and one screwy Philly dame with her own set of high octane problems would be strictly oil and fire. No go, nada, get lost. Except she had a thing for regular Philly guys with problems, or for one Philly guy with problems. And so to lure the unsuspecting Pat in she, as part of an agreement to with him to contact his wife, bargains him into becoming her amateur night dancing partner. Just partners that's all. As it turns out, they aren't half bad after a ton of practice and a road strewn filled with pitfalls. See too, though as it turned out he developed a thing for regular (if screwy) Philly gals (or gal).

Now let's say all this happened, plus a few odd-ball things around Pat's family issues, then you would have a very amusing and well-produced romantic comedy for the 21st century. Hey, I'll take the Eagles and three points, okay Pat. See this one, okay, even if you aren't a regular Philly guy or gal.",1369440000,,2989,4.460694698354661

5175167,4,B008OGIPJA,"So often redemption movies are about one damaged person surrounded by compassionate (or not) others who rally round to get them out of whatever ditch they're in - sometimes over and over again.  This movie about about two very damaged people, each of whom knows their own vulnerabilities and is able to be generous to the other out of their shared sense of being defective.  This is no pity-party however.  It's more like high speed emotional bumper cars.  It's also a reminder that behaviors we often pathologize today, so they can be ""treated,"" are perhaps just ""differences"" toward which we need to show radical acceptance and compassion.",1369440000,,641,4.962616822429907

This movie is a serious look at mental illness and how it effects all who have a loved one dealing with it.  Bradley Cooper is amazing in this role his layers of this character keep you totally glued to the movie.  Jennifer Lawerence is also amazing she is really coming into her own and showing she has what it takes to transform from teen star to grown up film icon.  Their chemistry is amazing, you find yourself rooting for these two misfits to get together. It does have very funny parts with lots of flawed characters who you make you wonder if they should be medicated as well.  Oh and there is Robert De Niro as well.  By the end of the movie you find yourself happy and at peace with how things will turn out.  It is so worth your time to watch  it.",1369440000,,828,4.19620253164557

Still shaking my head in amazement that this is considered comedy.............well, I'm not much of a movie goer, but not seeing much film for quite a number of years, I've not been sucked into entertainment complacency.  Poorly done, poor story line, no substance, no flow, poor character development, poor acting, pat, politically correct scenarios thrown in everywhere, pandering, etc.

As if that wasn't bad enough to make me walk out, the language of the supporting actress was.  Utterly disgusting!  Filling a movie from start to finish with foul language must be a criteria for award winning films these days.  Of all the things SLP didn't have, it definately had that.

Then it transformed into a real love story that was very enjoyable watching it play out.  It was somewhat predictable, but that didn't bother me at all.  Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast were superb.

We did not expect much from viewing this movie and were surprised that is was well-made and great chemistry among the actors.  Jennifer Lawrence is the best actress and Bradley Cooper should have been the best actor.  Both of these actors are under-rated and have a diverse and compeling way of acting.  Even the chemistry between the the father (played by Robert DeNiro) and his son Pat (Bradley Cooper) was interesting and revealing.

5175193,5,B008OGIPJA,"What more needs to be said about this film?  Eight Academy Award nominations including Best Director and Best Film with all four lead actors receiving critical accolades: Bradley Cooper (best performance of his career), Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver and JENNIFER LAWRENCE.  Yes, I purposely put her name in ALL CAPS.

I'll address the movie albeit in a short-shifted manner.  You want to know more about the film?  At this writing, you've got almost 700 (and growing!) perspectives on this Amazon site.  Pick one.  Enjoy!  Most of my review, however, will deal with the phenomenon that is Ms. Lawrence.

""...Playbook"" Director David O. Russell calls her, ""an extraordinarily gifted, young, scary actress"" who is
""wise beyond her years.""  One of the film's producers, Donna Gigliotti, says Lawrence is, ""absolutely the most staggering talent I have seen come along in Hollywood in a very long time.""

In the role of ""Tiffany"", a psychologically-damaged and sexually-addicted young widow, Lawrences juxtaposes subtle nuances of facial expressions and physical adroitnes with varied concoctions of emotional tones ranging from vulnerable to impulsive violence.  Her character is sometimes completely devoid of any civilized social skill.

Lawrence's uber-consummate and creative on-camera professionalism is no surprise when you view her expeditious acting evolution from TV's Bill Engvall Show at age 16 to critically-praised films such as ""The Poker House,"" ""The Burning Plain,"" ""Winter's Bone,"" and ""The Hunger Games.""  (I'll skip ""Like Crazy.""  Her acting as that of a twice-dumped, passive girlfriend was surprisingly pedestrian.)

Lawrence's physical beauty is unique and flawed.  She is
not stereotypically skinny and, quite frankly, looks like
she could kick the butts of some dudes.  She can look gorgeous or unintentionally-dorky depending on the lighting, tilt of her head or smile.  The best part of her body?  Her neck which appears longer than the norm giving her a regal appearance.  Don't forget great posture.  Seriously.  That's an important part in creating her disarming figure.

And her voice? Breathy, without being overtly sexual, sometimes mildly grating, often accusatory in tone and occasionally a growling shriek of sorts will sneak in there.  From time to time, all four vocal characteristics meld together which creates an exclamation point on the most mundane dialogue.

Saving the best for last.  Her off-screen persona is
spontaneously unbrideled and nonconformist.  She is less pretentious and politically correct than her peers.  Lawrence must be a nightmare for studio sycophants who wish to contain her ingenuous and candid observations about...well...seemingly anything.

She flips people off, uses taboo words in public and openly despises the parasitic paparazzi.  After a Dior fashion shoot which was excessively photoshopped to make her appear unrealistically thin, Lawrence simply said, ""real people don't look like that.""

Charmingly charismatic, talented, beautiful, humorous and refreshing with her usual unfiltered honestly.  Keep being yourself, Jennifer.  Seems to be working.

Oh, the movie she was just in, ""Silver Linings Playbook.""

However, when the story line started to focus on Bradley and Jennifer, I started to get into the movie.  By the end, I was deeply immersed in the movie.  I came to care about the characters, and (spoiler alert) jumped up and cheered at the end.  I took off one star because of the slow start, but it is a good movie.

I often judge a movie by the after-taste and I can report this movie left nothing but positive recollections. There were only a few of the x-gen snarks and ""really?"" comebacks. Deniro finally played a role as a human being and his vulnerability and humanity is what made him good to start with. Cooper is good although the garbage bag thing got a little old after the first hour. You will fall in love with Jennifer Lawrence. Like actually in love. This girl reminds of Robert Duvall - wait, stay with me, like Duvall in that she lets the scene simmer, doesn't rush her lines, each one as if it just popped into her head, she is the star of every scene she's in.

The fact that an essentially boring blue collar jock is also wrestling with mental illness, doesn't automatically make him an interesting character and this character isn't. The talk about this being DeNiro's return to serious acting is unconvincing in light of his performance which I found unbelievable. In his defense i believe he was miscast for the part. He's too ""Big"" for it. It needed a less high profile and frankly less ""present"" actor to pull it off.
He tends to overpower everyone but Lawrence just by being there. The good part of the story is the portrayal of unconditional love the son receives from his family. That rings true in its desperation, and is not something I've seen a lot of before.",1369180800,,788,4.888059701492537

No car crashes or explosions, just a great story well told about characters I cared about. If that makes it a chick flick, so be it.

5175237,4,B008OGIPJA,"So, the David O. Russell who directed SPANKING THE MONKEY and THREE KINGS is now making Oscar bait films. It's rare for a heralded director of indie (SPANKING THE MONKEY) or fringe Hollywood (THREE KINGS) filmmaking to maintain the things that made him so unique a voice and still make the short list for the Awards season. Well, as with he did with 2010's THE FIGHTER, Russell gives us an gritty and emotional but an ultimately heart-warming, crowd-pleasing, life-affirming film about overcoming the odds and getting your heart's desire that is also packed with an extraordinary ensemble and a supreme standout performance. This is what Russell has become over time, and while this is a good quality film, it's not what I used to go to David O. Russell films to see.

Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, you have Pat (Bradley Cooper, in what apparently amounts to a nomination-worthy performance), who is leaving a state hospital in Baltimore with his mother (Jacki Weaver) back to their home in Philadelphia. Pat suffers from a bipolar disorder, finally diagnosed after a severe altercation with the man sleeping with his wife (he beat the crap out of him), and as part of a plea agreement, he decided to be admitted. He arrives back home to his father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro, for once, NOT phoning it in as he's done for the last several years, since probably RONIN), a severely superstitious (or is it OCD) man about his beloved Philidelphia Eagles and after losing his job and pension, he has become a bookmaker. Pat, upon returning home, has a singular goal: To get back his wife Nikki, and he'll do whatever he feels necessary to do so, seeing his ""silver linings"" in the opportunities he looks to create. Still severely unhinged, he goes to a dinner thrown by his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his extremely domineering wife Veronica (a severely underused Julia Stiles) and meets Veronica's younger, similarly unhinged sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who recently lost her cop husband in a car accident and they form a strangely provocative bond. It is through this chance meeting (or is it chance?) that both Pat and Tiffany seek normalcy and solace in each other as they seem to try to out-crazy each other, each looking at their own goals: Pat wants Nikki back, and Tiffany wants to compete in a freestyle dance competition. Oh, and there's also Chris Tucker here as a somwehat innocuous fellow inmate of the hospital who keeps escaping.

Russell is an adept director as always, and he keeps things moving very fluidly, but the film leaves you asking a lot of questions. Is it supposed to be a comedy? A drama? A film about dealing with mental illness? What purpose does Chris Tucker serve (not only in this film, but in the universe)? Why doesn't the film ever deal with Pat Sr. as far as his possible mental illness? Why does the film almost completely ignore Jacki Weaver? Why does Tiffany seem like the only character that's well-rounded?

Well, I do have an answer to that one. As he did with THE FIGHTER, Russell seems to LOVE to showcase one singularly talented person in an extremely showy role. In THE FIGHTER, it was Christian Bale, and he won (deservedly so) the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that film. In this film, that showcase is given to Jennifer Lawrence, who (not quite so deservedly so) won Best Actress for this film. Make no mistake; it's a great performance. Is it Oscar-worthy? Of nomination? Yes. Of winning? No, or at least not against Jessica Chastain and her totally immersive and subtle performance in ZERO DARK THIRTY. But there's the rub; The Weinstein Company who produced this film, and the Weinstein's former studio Miramax, blitz the living hell out of the Oscar voters in massive campaigns that are reminiscent of presidential campaigns. This is how in 1999, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and more recently, how, in 2010, THE KING'S SPEECH defeated THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Just on a bit of a tangent here, let's face it; Oscar voters LOVE the opportunity to celebrate performances that show great impersonations of real-life figures (Edith Piaf, Idi Amin, Truman Capote, Abraham Lincoln, etc.), people mimicking disabilites or mental issues (RAIN MAN, MY LEFT FOOT, FORREST GUMP, SHINE, etc.), and big, showy, bombastic performances like Bale's in THE FIGHTER or Lawrence's in this film. And then, every once in a while, they'll find the year to give it to the right person.

In the final analysis, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a very good, very solid film with some excellent performances, and it really does a little more than the bare minimum to be complete. But is this a film for the ages, like THREE KINGS or is this a performance that will be remembered, other than it being Lawrence's first win (which she deserved more for her first nomination, the brilliant WINTER'S BONE)? Like Pat and Tiffany's dance competition, it doesn't stand a chance.

The first hour of the movie is fantastic and original and very true to life.  The second hour turns into Dirty Dancing, Flash Dance and 29th Street.  Its a great original story turned into the same old story.  By the way, when a family has a loved one with a serious mental disease the last thing they are doing is watching and caring so much about commercial sports.  It just falls apart when they all meet in Bradley's living room after the Eagles Game.  It just took the fire out of the story. And the Therapist sitting there made me cringe - so stupid.

5175249,4,B008OGIPJA,"""Crazy doesn't fall far from the tree,"" might be the theme of this very funny film.  Oh, but you may want to add, ""But who cares, as long as you're having fun?""  (I generally look for a strong theme in a film, and if I can't find one, then I consider that to be a bad sign.  This one did have a strong theme to me, perhaps different from the one that I came up with, but it should be noted that, just because I find a theme doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with it.  Doesn't matter.  But that would be an argument for another day. . . .)

I really like the way that Robert De Niro's career -- or make that ""careers"" -- have gone.  After all, it seems that within film, he's had two:  the I'm-gonna-kick-your-tail films early on, and then the I'm-gonna-make-you-laugh films later on.  I think that he's been really good at both; you surely can't call him a one-trick pony.  I think that sometimes, people underestimate him on his comedic timing; I think it's almost perfect.  And I really liked him in all those ""Meet the Focker"" films, even though I thought that that series was surely drawing diminishing returns towards the end.

And this film reminds me of a Ben Stiller film, but without the mean spiritedness of it all.  You have to admit, Mr. Stiller's films, while being very funny, can dive a little too deep into the depths of humiliation.  This film does not go in that direction.  Sure, it shows the weaknesses of our two protagonists -- and there are surely many -- but it never makes fun of those characters.  Instead, the audience always has empathy for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, and that was a very wise move.  Wise enough to get Ms. Lawrence an Academy Award, one that I think she probably deserved here.

I do have to admit that I believe that some of Ms. Lawrence's films in the past have been somewhat overrated.  ""The Burning Plain"" was nearly unwatchable (I reviewed that film awhile back and hated the non-linear narrative); ""Winter's Bone,"" while being good, surely wasn't great (I used to stay in the Ozarks every summer as a kid with an uncle, and the people were nothing like those portrayed in that film); and ""The Hunger Games"" was perhaps only as good as the ""Twilight"" series.  But in my opinion, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is probably her best performance and her best film.  By far.

Well, with apologies, you'd have to be crazy not to put this film on your Wish List.  And perhaps crazier not to make that final purchase and watch it.",1369008000,,2483,4.4688888888888885

5175260,3,B008OGIPJA,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a romantic dramedy adapted from the book of the same name by Matthew Quick. David O. Russell wrote the screenplay and directs. Pat Solitano, Jr. (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital, where he spent some time after severely beating his wife's lover. He immediately vows to win back the affections of his estranged wife Nikki, against the advice of his bookmaking father (Robert De Niro) and headstrong mother (Jackie Weaver). When Pat is introduced to Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend, sparks fly, as she is recently widowed with some problems of her own. Tiffany proposes that she help Pat contact Nikki -if he will be her competitive dance partner in return.

David O. Russell chose this material, because it made mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, accessible. And Pat is not the only one afflicted. Tiffany dealt with her husband's death with pathological behavior. Pat's father has a minor obsessive-compulsive disorder. Danny (Chris Tucker), a friend from the hospital, has drug problems and a constant battle over the legal status of his hospitalization. It's a menagerie of personality problems. I'm not sure that any of these characters are quite believable, but the film doesn't try to pass dysfunction off as quirkiness, a common ploy in independent film. It takes a matter-of-fact but sympathetic approach to the characters' problems. Pat's struggle to deal with his impulses makes him sympathetic.

The film glosses over, or even advocates, some very bad behavior, however. Pat is bipolar, but Tiffany's problems are more troubling. Tiffany reacts to situations in which she feels uncomfortable by accusing innocent men of sexual harassment. She does this once and alludes to it a second time. She repeatedly lies to Pat about things that are important to him and sees nothing wrong with toying with others' emotions for her own gratification. None of this is presented in a negative light. In fact, we are supposed to celebrate Tiffany's self-acceptance. But making unfounded accusations is not acceptable. Jennifer Lawrence is an appealing actress, and that white-washes the character. She makes Tiffany's frankness seem charming, which it is in some contexts, but Tiffany has no concept of right and wrong, and she doesn't have psychosis to blame. She's the last person with whom a bipolar individual should be involved.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features include 17 deleted scenes. There is a meandering featurette called ""Silver Linings Playbook: The Movie That Became a Movement"" (29 min), which features interviews with director David O. Russell, author Matthew Quick, the cast, some psychiatrists, and composer Danny Elfman. ""Dance Rehearsal"" (1:30 min) is a brief snippet, and ""Going Steadicam with Bradley Cooper"" (1 min) is also a snippet of someone filming Cooper experimenting with a Steadicam. Those last two are not worthwhile. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.",1368921600,3,3054,5.305785123966942

5175271,5,B008OGIPJA,"Life isn't perfect, but it could be worse.  At least you're not manic-depressive, you didn't catch your wife cheating on you,  you didn't beat the crap out of the guy, you weren't sent to 8 months in a mental institution, and you're not now released and obsessed with getting back together with your wife.  (Well, you're probably not ALL of those.)  Pat (Bradley Cooper) has these things going against him, but he's getting better, and he's worked out a mental health aid that always has him looking for a silver lining in every situation.  After his release, he soon meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), sister of his friend's wife, whose own cop husband has been slain in the line of duty.  His father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) is currently unemployed but is making money as a bookie for football game bets.

I suppose they file this one under ""romantic comedy"" but it's not really a laugh out loud type of movie, neither is it exactly a black comedy.  There is some occassional humor to it.  This is not your stereotypical ""chick flick"" by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting was very well done- all the characters felt like real people.  Damaged people, messed up people, but real.

If you liked ""As Good as it Gets,"" and/or ""A Beautiful Mind"" you should like this movie.

Rated R for some violence and nudity (when Pat catches his wife cheating on him.)

5175273,3,B008OGIPJA,"I think of this movie as ""Rachel Getting Married"" meets ""Jerry Maguire.""  There are people with really serious behavioral health issues, and then there is the neat little bow in which the screenplay seeks to tie up those issues, in the form of a love story.  To me, the family dynamics are the most interesting aspect; there are flashes of really great moments between Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Nero as son and father, respectively.  As others have pointed out, the scenes with the family can be difficult to watch -- there is a lot of yelling and physicality between the characters (laced with humor to keep things more edgy than off-putting).  It's clear that Cooper's ""Pat"" isn't the only member of his clan who can benefit from therapy.  Despite the film's emphasis on being positive and its comedic infusions, there's a lot of heavy stuff here -- which is why to me, the rather rapidly paced love story seems out of place.  The movie isn't about a guy going through a mid-life crisis, it's about someone grappling with mental health issues.  It doesn't seem like handing him a ""you complete me"" moment is going to fix that. I'll stop there because I don't want to to take away from how well-acted the movie is and I totally respect the fact that many, many people enjoyed it much more than I did.  I think it comes down to a matter of preference: If you're looking for a darker but still ""Hollywood"" romantic comedy, then you'll probably enjoy this film very much.  If you're expecting a less mainstream touch, then you might be disappointed.",1368921600,2,1550,4.648351648351649

5175281,2,B008OGIPJA,"I made the mistake of viewing this film based upon the large number of high ratings.  The story is principally about Pat, an unstable bipolar man released from a mental hospital where he spent eight months in lieu prison time.  When he is discharged we find that the people in his life are almost as sick as he, leading one to suspect that they may have been the cause of the condition causing his hospitalization.  Through guilt trips, lies, trickery and insensitivity, his family and friends create an almost impossible return to reality for poor Pat.  While there were a few comical lines and scenes, I was annoyed by the film more than entertained, perhaps because I have a family member who was diagnosed as bipolar and his reactions to life's normal events are not a potential subject for a romantic comedy.  The film could have been a drama if treated more seriously.  Conversely, it could have been a black comedy exploring the absurdities of bipolar behavior.  To try to cut drama with comedy in this case does not make for a great film.  However, given the film's popularity, I would urge you to make up your own mind if the cost of the rental is something that you will not regard as a material loss if you are disappointed.",1368835200,2,1235,4.581818181818182

It kind of reminds me of the bad movies of the 1980's that end with the star accomplishing some feat such as boxing, skating, karate, or baseball. The only difference was that they threw in mental illness into the mix in this one.  They even threw in the token black friend who has no life, but depends on others for his happiness. Totally silly and a waste of time.  The acting was horrible except for DeNiro.  I would have rated 1 star if not for him.",1368835200,,570,4.2407407407407405

It was fine, but not a movie I'd watch again. It seemed too long and too short at the same time; some plots points could have used much more time while others were completely overblown. It seemed disjointed and if it was trying just a bit too hard. Good actors, but it just didn't click with me. I really enjoy Jennifer Lawrence, but she was an example of a character in the movie that just didn't ring true to me. I much prefer some of her other performances, such as in Winter's Bone.

Surprisingly, my favorite actor in this movie was Chris Tucker. I really enjoyed his scenes. There was also one scene with Robert De Nero and Bradley Cooper when Robert was in Bradley's bedroom talking to him about not knowing how to help him now or in the past. Hand's down, the best scene in the film. Heartfelt without being overly dramatic or sentimental. But a couple of good scenes and performances don't carry this movie through in my opinion.

What I felt fell short of a flawless film was the ending. Instead of staying on the themes of coping with mental illness and developing the complexities of the characters, the film starts shifting into a romantic comedy, which really irritated me. The book conveys a complex relationship between Pat and Tiffany, but the ending of the movie almost turns it into a saccharine, formulaic romantic comedy.

 Everyone in the story lies, disturbingly so.

 Yet these flaws are supposed to be excused because these people are mentally ill.  I don't know when mental illness conveyed a new moral code on the populace.  How is okay to lie to your lover and your family?  Or just fine to ruin everyone else's dinner at the restaurant or frighten the children out trick-or-treating?  How is it all right to beat people up every time you're in a rage, which is pretty often in this movie?  They refuse to take their medication because it makes them feel ""foggy.""  Right, but beating someone senseless is better?  The morality in this movie is downright narcissistic.  Everything is about me.  No one else matters.

5175357,5,B008OGIPJA,"From [...]

A gripping, charming, hilarious, and moving movie about a couple troubled people making life work in their own way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both at the absolute top of their game. Both actors deliver mesmerizing Oscar worthy performances and sell what was already a fantastically written script. In a smaller support role that turns out being a lot more important than at first glance, Robert De Niro brings one of the most moving performances in his recent career.

When Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is released from a court ordered stay in a mental institution he moves back in with his parents. Pats goal is a new attitude, fitness, and to reconcile with ex-wife. His behavior is obsessive and he has no filter on what comes out of his mouth but it is clear Pat isn't an overall bad guy. As pieces of his past are filled in, the depth of the character comes into focus. Pat Senior (Robert De Niro) at first comes off as a smaller role who throws out a couple snappy one liners but doesnt amount to much. As the story continues and Pat Jr. and Sr. interact more it becomes very clear how Pat turned out the way he did. Pat Sr. isn't a bad man or a bad father and mental illness can not be blamed on the individual but the personality traits carried through father and son are very well laid out and subtle. At a dinner with some old friend Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). The two seem to have no chemistry at all but end up bonding over their own social issues and medications they have been on. After a couple seeming random encounters the two form a unique and borderline hostile friendship. The friendship deepens and Pat agrees to help Tiffany with a dance competition she has been training for.

Silver Linings Playbook was advertised primarily as a comedy, the movie is very funny. As funny as the movie is it is also very deep and moving when it needs to be. Director David O. Russell really strikes a perfect balance between the deep emotions and hysterics that are delivered perfectly by the amazing cast. Along the way as Pat and Tiffany grow closer Playbook could easily have derailed and became one of several typical romantic-comedies that get churned out every year. Bradley Cooper would have needed to flash a smile and Jennifer Lawrence bear her emotions after indulging in expensive ice cream and the movie could have been shipped, sold and forgotten about. Instead the audiences were served a spectacular story about family, friends, redemption, moving forward and all forms of love. The various levels of the movie don't just make it interesting to experience but give a lot of re-watch value beyond the humor and amazing performances. The writing is so well done that everything cant possibly be absorbed one time through but nothing is obtuse.

Bradley Cooper has been acting for a while now and has moved steadily up into meatier roles. He has proven he can handle comedy in popular movies like Wedding Crashers (2005) and The Hangover (2009), he handled action in The A-Team, and has had more than his fair share of romantic comedies. While always delivering for the part he was given Silver Linings Playbook is the first time he got to fully stretch his legs and show off what he can do as an actor. In the best performance of his career so far (no doubt that there is more amazing performances to come from him) Cooper plays Pat perfectly. At times he is bouncing off the walls and at other times he is angry beyond comprehension but Cooper always brings these extremes up to the line but never crossing into doing too much. Jennifer Lawrence hasn't been acting for quite as long but started her career fairly young and has had a variety of roles. Her first leading film role was in Winters Bone (2010) and she proved that she has what it takes to be a leading actress. As good as Lawrence did in Winters Bone and her other movies leading up to Silver Linings Playbook, Playbook was a whole new league to the caliber of acting Lawrence is capable of. Tiffany is a more damaged character than Pat in some way and Lawrence gives the audience no choice but to feel for her. Her performance is incredibly moving while she teeters on the brink of incredibly strong or cracked and fragile. Robert De Niro gives his strongest performance in years as well. De Niro plays a man his age, a husband and a father. There is none of the typical De Niro cool or toughness that seems to follow him to the majority of his roles. Taking that away he is left as a very real man. He wasn't a perfect father or husband but a man who tried his best and he feels completely real. Pat Sr. has some obsessive compulsive tendencies, a gambling problem, and a horrible temper. A lot of these traits can be seen in both of his sons in the movie and the progression is subtle, but makes all the characters that much more complete. The supporting case is also impeccable. Chris Tucker makes his first appearance in 2005. He provides some great comedic relief and doesnt overstay his welcome. It was nice seeing Tucker in a tame but still hilarious role since in the bast he mostly overacted and was always over the top. Jacki Weaver, Dash Mihok, John Ortiz, Shea Whigham, and Julia Styles round out the rest of the cast with smaller but very important parts.

Silver Linings Playbook is absolutely one of the best movies of its year. Every element of the film clicks into place perfectly. There is something for every movie-goers taste and Cooper and Lawrence prove that they are a couple actresses that audiences will be seeing a lot more of in the future.",1368489600,,5591,4.587

Even so, I can't say it was an enjoyable viewing experience. The dialogue for the first 2/3 consisted mostly of screeching arguments, and the scenes seemed to transition randomly (with little logic).

The acting by the two main leads, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, is topnotch, and they bring a chemistry between them to the screen that I have not seen in a movie in a long time.  The secondary supporting actors also deliver, including Robert de Nero and Chris Tucker.  Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed!",1368489600,,445,4.469135802469136

It is easy to see why Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar for her incredible performance as a young woman overcoming many obstacles in her life. Bradley Cooper, likewise, gave an outstanding performance in his role as a man learning to cope with his issues as well.

I especially liked being able to download this movie on my Kindle because I was able to watch it on my own time, and I could take it with me if I wanted to watch it when I was away from home.

5175379,4,B008OGIPJA,Overall this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be once I made it through the beginning. I enjoy the hidden message in this film and I would encourage anyone to watch this film. The only reason I gave it a four star is there is a lot of yelling so I had to constantly turn down the volume and some parts of the movie were slow.,1368489600,,339,3.857142857142857

This movie no where comes close to The Life of Pi or Zero Dark Thirty or even Lincoln. It's glazes over mental illness with romance, those that really are bi-polar know it doesn't get better just because you find romance. It was not much more than a time killer.

5175393,4,B008OGIPJA,"The character Jennifer Lawrence played is raw and hardcore but still capable of empathy. It's similar to the tough, red neck one she played in Winter's Bone. I'm pleased she won best actress for this year's film. I thought Bradley Cooper's character suffered from delusions more like schizophrenia than manic/depression. His middle of the night rants and friviolous passions did make him seem biploar but I don't recall any descents into depression. He could become violent like Jennifer Lawrence's character that's why as lovers I imagine their love will either emotionally heal each other or lead to fights until they've both had enough.",1368403200,,639,5.213592233009709

I had given up on Robert DeNiro ever doing anything edgy again, but he hits just the right reactions.  Of course there is a romantic triangle of sorts that keeps you guessing and many funny but inappropriate lines blurted out to the wrong person at the wrong time.  It's way more emotionally effective than most bittersweet comedies.",1368403200,,457,4.675

5175398,5,B008OGIPJA,"I am very familiar with the behavior of people with bipolar disorder, and the main character (played by Bradley Cooper)  portrays this mental illness accurately, as does Jennifer Lawrence.  Her character is suffering from some unnamed illness, possibly bipolar or borderline personality (these illnesses share a number of traits).  The people involved in both of their lives though, have their own set of problems that prove, in some ways, to be almost as dysfunctional.  The writers seem to be leaning heavily on the idea that ""we all have something""  in our lives to deal with: some challenge, some hang-up. That ought to make it easier to understand each other in our struggles, but sadly, we often end up at odds.",1368403200,,717,4.941666666666666
5175399,3,B008OGIPJA,"I was really excited to watch this movie last night as it has been advertised as a light hearted romantic comedy. It is not. The main drive of the story is watching people with severe mental illnesses interact with one another; including the two main characters. As you can imagine, these people fight, yell, manipulate, and there is a very unnerving scene of domestic violence. I am not a person who is put off by these types of stories; however, I felt that the movie was marketed in such a way to avoid actually showing that 90% of this movie is disturbing and depressing. The ending is cute and at least redeemed the fact that I sat through this film. On Amazon, the HD switched to regular about 20 minutes into the movie. You can see when it happens, so I would reccommend saving yourself the extra dollar if you do rent Silver Linings Playbook.

5175413,3,B008OGIPJA,"Right away I didn't like the fact that Bradley Cooper is 38 and Jennifer Lawrence is 22 which is that constant reminder in life that in the movies guys seem to only be compatible with girls 15-20 years younger than them. Jennifer played the part well but I wasn't buying the whole crazy, sleeping around, widower thing, I think another actress would have been a better choice for this particular role for compatibility purposes.

I liked the unneeded loyalty that Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has on the past, it somehow reminded me of myself, which some men hold loyalties longer then they should.  Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) was the black widow, a mysterious girl indeed; she will have you saying ""why did she do that"" one moment and then ""no don't do it"" the next. Tiffany played by Jennifer Lawrence did do a wonderful job.

5175424,3,B008OGIPJA,"Stop right here, if you are concerned about spoilers!

One of the best things to be said about this film is that it left me eager to pick up the novel by Matthew Quick!  It's a well acted piece, which definitely leads you to empathize with its characters.  Yet, I share the concern of a National Catholic Register review, which concludes that the film ultimately leaves you rooting against marital reconciliation (www(dot)youtube.com/watch?v=aTi9JDmQP4M).  Couldn't the story line have had you rooting for two characters finding each other, without it being necessary to leave a marriage behind?

Oddly, John McCarthy's review on a Catholic News Service web site seems only to fault ""brief glimpses of a violent assault, fleeting rear and partial female nudity, some profane language, frequent crude and crass terms and sexual innuendo"" (See www(dot)catholicnews(dot)com/data/movies/13mv001(dot)htm).  I don't understand why this arm of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops doesn't mention the same concern as the National Catholic Register review.",1368316800,,1051,5.578616352201258

5175426,5,B008OGIPJA,"Most of us have had to be educated emotionally at some point in our lives. This wonderfully told story manages to invite a range of identification with the emotional issues the characters in the film encounter that goes beyond their particular circumstances. I found myself strongly involved with many of the characters in this movie. It could be that beyond the typical categories of leading and supporting roles this movie manages to cast societal mental and spiritual disorder as a transcendent character in the film to which all the characters play a supporting role. I believe almost anyone after watching the film will find some new space for reflection and healing because the actor's performances all connect us with and give permission to feel very typical but awkward and uncomfortable emotions that we would often like to just avoid. If you have the opportunity, this would be a great movie to see with people (even if only virtually) that you trust and care about so you could discuss what happened for you when you watched it.",1368316800,,1039,4.909090909090909
5175427,2,B008OGIPJA,"This movie contains what seems to be two standard components of most movies today:  1) flawed characters who display immature, even aberrant, behavior, even at 40+ years old and whom we're supposed to sympathize with and/or smile at; 2) glorifying characters who act on every emotion they have, particularly if it contributes to their happiness.  This is probably a case of art imitating life, and of course, Hollywood will put a romantic spin on it.  However, I'm so sick of this propaganda and lack of originality that I've stopped going to the movies and pretty soon, I'll be forced to just stop watching new movies altogether. In that this movie was nominated for an academy award (and Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for portraying a less-than-challenging part), I think I'm making the right decision.

I could tear this movie apart, but I don't want to take the time. I'll just point out two annoyances:

1) Why is Nicki's affair shrugged off as if it is nothing?  Why is the movie presenting Pat as the nutty one for beating the crap out of a man he finds in the shower with his wife?? Sorry, but I don't find that reaction strange. I think many men would react similarly at finding some man boffing his wife in their own shower! Pat is certainly portrayed as unstable, but that act is not what makes him so.  The movies seems to be trying to portray Nicki as the victim to Pat, when it's just the opposite. Why is her affair treated as of no consequence?

2) What's the deal with Pat whispering something in Nicki's ear at the end that the audience cannot hear and never finds out about?  Ever since Lost In Translation (which was a far superior movie), this whispering something the audience cannot hear has caught on, and now when it's used, it's just contrived.",1368316800,3,1775,4.627388535031847

5175432,1,B008OGIPJA,"Thinking positive is a result of cultural conditioning or from positive things happening, they do not cause healthy behavior.  Thoughts are effects NOT causes.  Stop telling us thinking positive helps anyone.  Manipulate contingencies to make people feel good and shape effective humanism.  There is no self initiating force in the universe, much less the brain.  Thoughts have never caused human behavior so shut up and stop making movies as ignorant as Silver Linings Playbook! We have thoughts and they are effects produced by interactions with the environment. Thoughts are side effects.  They are not causes for behavior.  Nobody has ever seen a thought cause behavior, never, they are only said to be causes of behavior because they are paired with behavior at times and that is coincidental reinforcement, superstitious behavior AND superstitious behavior causes problems.  Causes happen 100% of the time.  People many times think they are going to go upstairs and go downstairs, sometimes they just sit there.  Thus, thoughts are superfluous.  Evolution could never select a thought to cause behavior for every situation, not only that natural selection couldn't select a different thought as thoughts are unique according to every individuals unique conditioning, there is no evidence thoughts cause behavior and undeniable evidence that they don't cause behavior.  Humans behave because of their environmental history, evolutionary history and the current situation. NOT descriptions. People behave the way they do regardless of what they think.  How many times does a person say he will not engage in sex and thinks it is a sin, but does so if presented with the opportunity. I mean, causes have to happen 100% of the time and anyone can talk of an example where a persons thoughts were the opposite of their behavior.  Please stop regurgitating your superstitious assertions, they are counter productive to improving the human condition.

People behave according to six causes:

1. Genetic Endowment
2. Pre-natal chemical environment
3. Post-natal chemical environment
4. Pavlovian Conditioning: stimulus-stimulus-response
5. Skinnerian Conditioning: stimulus-response-consequence
6. Traumatic factors

These causes for behavior work through generalization, discrimination, avoidance behavior, punishment, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, etc....  Human behavior is complicated, but there are real world variables that determine behavior NOT thoughts.  You sheople that continue to regurgitate superstitious rhetoric like behavior is caused by thoughts are ruining any chance we have of understanding human behavior.  Learning to manipulate real world variables is the only behavior that will allow us to be healthy and happy!

5175433,5,B008OGIPJA,"I really enjoyed this film, it had a story line that was well pieced together.  It was a slightly dark comedy as well as being romantic.

5175434,1,B008OGIPJA,"To the above reviewers who think this was a good movie, who gave is 5 or even 3 stars, you are nuttier than the supposed unbelievable nutty main characters in this movie.  You must go watch a series of good moves, like Midnight Cowboy, The Godfather, and about 10,000 others before you even rate another movie.  The high review scores for this movie convinces me that we as a species are doomed.  THIS MOVIE STUNK.  I am embarassed for Robert De Niro that at the end of his career, he agreed to be in this lame movie.  What the hell was it about?

I will give  you that it started off decent, had a good premise with potential, and I even laughed a bit.  But then it devolved into .... into...what?  I am not sure.  So the scriptwriter brainstorming must have said, hey, let's make her a slut, for unknown reasons, and yeah, throw in a dance contest that happened to fall on the same day as the big Philadelphia Eages football games vs. Dallas Cowboys?  Dance contest romance movies have now become a cliche, ever since Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance, and Dirty Dancing, and this was an awful attempt to resurrect the genre - because it was an afterthought for a terrible script.

Also, the lead role was made for Ben Stiller.

AWFUL!",1368230400,5,1236,4.464285714285714

5175439,4,B008OGIPJA,"I doubt there is much about this movie I can say that hasn't been said in the over 400 reviews here on Amazon, so I will keep it short. Bradley Cooper surpassed my expectations in his performance. This says a lot considering the stellar cast of this film. If you think this is a comedy you will be disappointed. It is more like the Space Mountain of emotional roller coasters. I say Space Mountain because it is a dark coaster so you don't know what is coming. I find most movies are predictable these days, so I enjoyed Silver Lining's originality.
SPOILER ALERT: With that said, I'm compelled to make one comment that is not part of the review of SLP as a film. To even consider betting your future on a sports game is NUTS. To make that bet against the New York Giants is a level of stupidity that should require oneself and one's offspring to be neutered as to remove them from the gene pool. I must say, it feels good to get that out. Phew. Thank you, Amazon for the forum. Notice I did not say how the bet turned out, just that such a bet is stupid to make. Oh, and it was a shame when Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper got hit by a bus at the end. Bummer.",1368230400,,1165,4.182222222222222

5175441,5,B008OGIPJA,"Great movies are hard to find and this one is very good.  It features a well written story line and the acting is just superb.  Jennifer Lawrence is just a knockout in this film and she proves her talent while playing an emotionally disturbed woman.  The other main character is Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who is a mentally disturbed young man who is suffering from the loss of his adulterous wife. Together they find happiness in each other's arms after overcoming their own emotional and mental issues.

This film is funny, sad, emotional and entertaining.  It is an all-star cast that adds to the entire enjoyment of the film and it is a movie worth seeing.  If you are a Jennifer Lawrence fan then this movie will just be totally fun for you.  Her role is sultry and sad at the same time and her talent really shines.",1368230400,,824,4.527027027027027
5175442,5,B008OGIPJA,"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is ultimately a love story about two damaged people.  It's not an examination of mental health nor an attempt to diminish or sanctify bipolarism.  I never found the treatment of mental illness funny in this film; in fact, the scenes involving Pat's breakdowns were disturbing and Danny's illness was sadly touching because he accepted his condition and its varying consequences.  The plot has been well discussed in many effective posts so no need to reiterate here.
I didn't have a strong desire to see this movie so my enjoyment surprised me.  And the main reason for my enjoyment is the superb casting.  Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Tiffany, as she was in WINTERS BONE, my first exposure to her talents.  She effortlessly embodies Tiffany's persona to create a multi-layered character you can't help liking.  Bradley Cooper is equally stunning as Pat, a performance I hadn't expected.  He too makes his troubled character irresistibly appealing.
Robert DeNiro hasn't been this good in years and Jacki Weaver is perfect as Pat's mom.  The rest of the cast including Julia Stiles, John Ortiz and Shea Whigam is excellent.
Director David O. Russell commandeers the movie with assured confidence and makes SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK a delightful film experience much more satisfying than the Oscar winning ARGO.",1368230400,,1347,5.170506912442396

Cooper is a good actor, but he's not great, and wasn't able to bring any nuance to the roll.  The story is hollywood, cliched, contrived, and feel good at the end. Also the whole Eagles ""signals"" thing was pretty tired and overworked.  I never felt these were real characters, I never felt any chemistry.  I really didn't learn anything about them, aside from some spoken exposition that wasn't convincing.  Sometimes when you fall to the 3rd and 4th choices for leads serendipity happens, but there's nothing special or any ""stars aligning"" for this movie. 3 stars",1368230400,,655,5.027777777777778

5175459,5,B008OGIPJA,"Okay. I agree with other reviewers that the book is way better than the movie. I did not read the book but based on the reviews and the movie itself, I am compelled to believe that the book should really be much better. But one must also admit that it is very hard to render or compress a good story that spans several hundred pages in a book into about a couple of hours movie.

Yes, the story could have been better rendered in the movie. The storyline had a great potential that was wasted. I also saw on the artwork of the disc that Jennifer Lawrence won 2012 Best Actress award. I wasn't surprised with that. Well deserved indeed. She is simply superb and there is not a single moment in the movie that you would think it is just an act, but a real person in real life, with all the gotchas, like any other human being. Never falling into melodramatic, but straight to the point.

The movie starts really slow and the initial part could have been shortened to give more space to the developing relationship of the main characters - particularly to the exchange of letters, which I believe is where the book should be doing better. Anyway, from the point where she reveals the circumstances of her husband's death (""That's a feeling"", indeed!), the story picks up and quickly starts revealing the beauty of that relationship.

I particularly liked the scenes shown while playing ""Girl from the North Country"". That's where I saw a beautiful story unveiling, somewhat too late in the movie.",1368230400,,1493,4.563432835820896

Having great actors doing great acting is only part of the equation though, you need a solid script for a movie to transcend good into great, and this movie definitely has that.  It was like Quentin Tarantino and Todd Phillips had a baby and named it this.  The dialogue that comes out of their mouths is riveting, at times funny, and at times breaks your heart.

Bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from the psych ward where he was sent for beating up a guy.  He returns to his Philadelphia childhood home and parents Pat, Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Julie Weaver), determined to win back the wife who left him.

The younger Pat struggles with his emotions, which are kept in not-too-reliable check by an assortment of medications.  He meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman with a history of her own.  Tiffany agrees to help Pat win back his former wife if he agrees to be her partner in an upcoming dance competition.

Cooper and Lawrence make what might have been a so-so movie shine.  Their on-screen chemistry sparkles and makes their on-again, off-again romantic sparring great fun to watch.  De Niro is excellent as the father who tries to understand his son's manic-depressive illness and support him, while being frustrated whenever Pat, Jr. lapses into moods or  gets himself into fights.  This is De Niro's best role in a long time.  All four principal actors were nominated for Academy Awards.  Lawrence won for Best Actress.

5175550,4,B008OGIPJA,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

So I finally got around to watching Silver Linings Playbook, the movie that everyone's been talking about, and I must say that I was pretty impressed. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of heart and I honestly can't remember seeing a movie this emotionally driven. It deals with some tough issues, mainly mental instability, and it does so with a degree of classiness that transforms this from a movie about the troubled to an emotional story about the changes people face on a day to day basis. We always want to go back to what we know, but sometimes that's not always what's best for us and we need to learn to move on.

The story follows a young man by the name of Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) as he's released from a mental health facility. Eight months ago he caught his wife cheating on him and that's when he found out that he was suffering from a bipolar disorder. In an attempt to stay out of prison after beating his wife's lover half to death, he settled on a plea bargain with the courts allowing him to attend this mental facility to better himself. After his mom picks him up from the facility he creates a plan. He's going to do a lot of reading and exercising in order to keep his mind in a solid place, but he has a major roadblock. He can't let go of his wife.

After having dinner at his friend Ronnie's (John Oritz) house, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany is a recent widow who just lost her job. She suffers from extreme depression which she handles by sleeping around with random people to help fill that void. She strikes up a deal with Pat when she tells him that she can get his letter to his wife. He would do it himself, but she had a restraining order put on him. In return for her help Pat agrees to assist her with this upcoming dance competition. What starts as two people helping each other soon turns into a deal filled with lies and deceit as the viewer learns that one of the parties involved may not be as helpful as they led you to believe. It's not done with ill intention so it feels fitting given the situation of both of these individuals.

As a whole I felt the story was solid. I think the main focus was on these troubled individuals who are looked at as psychos in the ""real"" world when really they're just like everyone else. They're people struggling through life just like the rest of us. So I thought it was commendable when both the leads and a few of the supporting characters all had some sort of mental problem. What makes matters worse for these characters is that people do look at them like some sort of circus show. Whenever Pat would have an episode there was this kid who kept coming to the house to see if he could record it for ""a school project"". It makes you empathize with Pat and it leaves you feeling disgusted that there are people like that in the world.

Everything in the story leads up to the dance competition and that's where I felt the film got a little rocky. It felt more like a means to an end than something substantial and I kind of felt like it derailed the mood set by the film's previous hour and 40 minutes. It's very loud and fun while majority of the movie is dark and somber. I understood its purpose in the big picture, but I think there may have been a better way to reach the point the movie sets out to make.

Silver Linings Playbook is led by Cooper and Lawrence who both gave excellent performances. Cooper proves once again that he's beyond being the eye-candy in The Hangover films and that he's an actor who everyone should take seriously. This was actually my introduction to Ms. Lawrence and I thought she gave a solid performance. I can't say that I understand all the hype around her just yet, and I don't understand how she won an award over Cooper, but she has a lot of potential. I just feel like she's still a developing actress with a lot of room to grow.

On top of the leads you have Robert De Niro playing Pat Senior, Jackie Weaver as Pat's mom, Chris Tucker as Pat's friend Danny, John Ortiz as Ronnie, and Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist Cliff. I said earlier that a few of the supporting characters had mental issues as well and those two characters would be Danny and Pat Sr. I don't remember if they specified what Danny's condition was, but Pat Sr. is a very superstitious individual suffering from OCD and he's also developed a slight gambling problem after losing his job. Out of the supporting cast I think De Niro gave the most memorable performance. He's always been able to tackle almost any role he's given and this was no different. With that said, everyone involved did a great job and it was nice to see Tucker on the big screen again.

Finally, the movie suffers from a few minor inconsistencies. The most obvious being when Pat and Tiffany are at the dance. When they start walking up the stairs Pat's on the right and Tiffany's on the left, but once they reach the top they're randomly switched. I don't know about you, but I've never seen two people walking up a set of stairs holding hands only to switch places along the way. Then during one of the practices Pat's necklace is in the front of his shirt, but when frame cuts to Tiffany it's on his back. Lastly, I don't know if it was the lighting or what, but in some scenes Tiffany's hair looks red while in majority of the film it's black, or at least it looked black. Now none of this is major, but it's stuff that I noticed because of who I am.

Overall Score: 8.75/10 - Silver Linings Playbook is one of those films that is just so easy to fall in love with. Between the characters and the script everything feels so comfortable and familiar. It's almost as if we know these characters in real life, they just have different faces. Cooper's performance, in particular, is phenomenal and he really brings out the heart and soul of his character and he gave, what I think, is the performance of his career. While the movie may not be perfect, there's a lot to love here and I definitely recommend taking the time to watch it.",1367971200,,6085,4.37787610619469

5175556,4,B008OGIPJA,"I don't support modern psychiatric mind control drug culture, so I faulted the movie one star for that... which is actually more crucial to may personal view of life. The great acting save this movie from the hack writing and pathetic story plot. Jennifer Lawrence has about 3 stellar, emotionally charged dynamic scenes although Cooper is the main driving force in the story. I've watched it countless times already and am quite convinced of my opinion that it's the acting that makes this lack luster story actually work as a light drama, and decent romanic movie.

The reason I object to the psycho babble drug culture/$$$/mind control/political weapon is that the main character has a typical male reaction to finding his wife have sex with a colleague in HIS SHOWER, and the guy having sex with his wife tells him "" I think you should go"" in his own house? this is reason for the husband to seek therapy and get doped up on drugs? while we come to find that the male colleague who broke up his marriage is STILL WORKING AT THE SCHOOL/COLLEGE as if HE DID NO WRONG? give me a break, that is drug culture psycho babble propaganda and I won't ever accept that crap. Bipolar? lol it's a joke, humans have emotions, feelings and reactions and it's normal to have moods, what the modern drug culture is preaching is mind control state of zombies, easy to make money off of them and easy to control them or lock people away like slave masters.",1367884800,,1441,4.5852713178294575
5175557,5,B008OGIPJA,"What is...is mental illness, and what should never be...is mental illness: This theme is represented through the very relatable story of an American family living in Philadelphia, PA. Patrick (Bradley Cooper) is leaving the hospital, after 8 months as an inpatient.  This is where he received his diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and is going home to confront more than his fair share of life's major issues.  Ill-equipped emotionally, although now knowing the reason why his life has been in disarray, he takes the bull by the horns with a positive attitude and goes mining for a silver lining.

The interactions of friends and family, including his father (Robert De Niro) and mother (Jacki Weaver), embraces all the successes and mishaps which make this story feel so relatable.  They all convincingly display the boundaries crossed, inappropriate behavior and controversial thinking present from time to time with Bipolar Disorder.  Patrick becomes extremely frustrated with the ending of Ernest Hemingway's, ""A Farewell To Arms"" and in a hair-trigger response pitches the book through his bedroom window.  This scenario is very relative to the anger, which sometimes simmers right under the surface and is very difficult to control.  His agitation (or bipolar anger) is quite understandable considering the state of his marriage and is as much present in the negative situations as in the positive; it walks hand-in-hand with the illness.

Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is living with many intense issues of her own upon meeting Patrick.  Their introduction is splendid and humorously filled with the mix-ups that become unique to them.  Moving forward, they form a camaraderie through comparing medications, pointing out where the other is ""inappropriate"", jogging on the same route, dancing lessons, and an airtight relationship that leads to love.  Their relationship is impressively acted and shows the 'normalcy' that the situation can and does become.  Patrick's friend Danny (Chris Tucker) who he meets in the hospital turns in a smaller role which adds much life and laughs to the movie.

The soundtrack (Danny Elfman) brings a standout masterpiece in itself to the characters.  A deft placement of purpose filled songs is overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time.  The vocals of Jack White (The White Stripes) are itchy and chaotic throughout. These are as ominous as the bombast of Led Zeppelin's fracturing song (""What Is and What Should Never Be"") featured during Patrick's bipolar episode at his parents home.  I found the music in this as important as another character to this movie's relevance.

Director David O. Russell is meticulous with the screenplay and uniquely personal with his own son contributing a spot-on performance in a bit-part.  ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (written by Matthew Quick during his own depression and subsequent pursuit to move forward) is a resiliently accurate portrayal of mental illness and family dynamics. A very comedic, painful but insightful look into Bipolar Disorder in its everyday life and a definite don't miss kind of movie.",1367884800,11,3089,5.320987654320987
5175558,5,B008OGIPJA,This is an awesome movie!  Hollywood was not mistaken to nominate this movie for best picture.  Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper have manifested acting talent that is highly impressive.  Bravo!,1367884800,,197,5.5
5175559,5,B008OGIPJA,"I have to be honest and say that i didn't hear very good reviews on this movie. But, because I am a movie fanatic i must always see for myself. First off, I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence and that was exciting in itself. The movie was hilarious, witty, charming, crazy, confusing and in all good ways. Robert Dinero oddly made me cry of course. The overall story was amazing. Love does not always come like in fairy tales and this movie proves that. Sometimes the pain can bring two people together, and sometimes the people we need the most are right in front of us, even if we cannot see it right away. All i can say its suprizing-ly entertaining and you will not regret watching it. I suggest you watch this when you aren't distracted by noise because everything that they say ,,,trust me you want to hear! I bought it the next day. GREAT movie!",1367798400,17,852,4.33125
5175560,5,B008OGIPJA,"So this being a movie after a book, and me being one of those people who like to read the book first, I read the book right before I watched this.

This is very different than the book.

I loved the book. Funny, raw, confusing, quirky, real. A good insight into mental illness and an interesting viewpoint. The book keeps you guessing. You don't know Pat's story right away, it unfolds for you, and when you think you know it, you find out that you didn't know anything about it. You root for Pat, and you feel for him and you laugh at his quirks. And you'll never see Kenny G the same way again.

The movie, tells you the beginning of Pat's story, and then you follow along. You know why Pat is where he is. The relationships he has with his family is almost opposite than the book. And he's less unstable than in the book. Everything is toned down. From his mental capacity, to Tiffany's scheming, to his therapist's involvement, to his father's obsession with football.
The movie takes Quick's story and makes it fit better in Hollywood.
And I loved the movie.

It's good. It's real and awkward and beautiful. But if you're expecting a light-hearted Rom-Com, you won't find it. If you're expecting a scene-by-scene, word-for-word adaptation of the book, you won't find it.
But if you want a good story that makes you smile and cringe and feel like every cloud actually does have a silver lining, than you will be satisfied.",1367798400,3,1426,4.515503875968992
5175561,5,B008OGIPJA,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The reason why it was so good? Because it was people ACTING and doing an amazing job at it. Not a whole bunch of crazy CGI and explosions to take away from an actor's lack of talent. Great casting in this movie. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play what it's like to suffer a loss combined with previous mental illness and how it feels to have lived the worst moment in your life, and have everyone around you see you as a crazy, broken outcast. This is an amazing movie for anyone who has gone through what these two characters have because it makes you feel human, not broken. Thank God, Hollywood and the rest of society are starting to accept mental illness as an ILLNESS and not something to be ashamed of.",1367798400,21,776,4.285714285714286

5175575,5,B008OGIPJA,"I watched the VOD version today. I was stunned by just how good the film was. It is one of the most poignant, touching and funny movies that I've seen it a long time. It treats mental illness and grief with a grace that is seldom seen in either film or literature. I won't discuss particulars of the plot because I won't give away the gifts the movie gives you. And they are gifts. Once you've seen it, you'll know why I say it.

A few things to touch on outside of the plot, though - Sorry Christoph Walz, but Robert De Niro was robbed of the Oscar. De Niro was the best I've seen him in years. He made me cry and few actors can bring one so close to their characters that their characters become real and not just faces on a screen. Walz is funny, but I've yet to see more than one note in his acting. De Niro is like a symphony. He should have won.

Bradley Cooper is fabulous and is going to be one of the best actors of his generation. Few come close to his range. (And no, I've never seen him in anything else. This movie was enough to convince me of his talent.)

Finally, Jennifer Lawrence's character was about as different from the Hunger Games character as possible and she earned that Oscar with a breathtaking performance.  I can't say why without giving the plot away, but wow, was she broken and fierce and so much more mature than her 21 years. Just wonderful.

See the movie. As you can tell, I loved every minute of it and I will probably watch it again to see the nuances in the film I may have missed the first time. It really is that good.",1367712000,3,1560,4.152317880794702

My husband didn't necessarily like the raw ""in your face"" way of the movie but he still enjoyed it. Obviously there are bad words and some crude language but it was funny and the story was well told.

5175578,4,B008OGIPJA,"Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything -- his house, his job, and his wife.

Pat is determined to rebuild his life.  All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet-and to  share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated.

Silver Linings Playbook walks the fine line with a romantic comedy that details mental illness but for the most part does it right without going overboard.  The movie starts a little slow but providing an interesting enough romantic comedy story with a strong performance from Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Cooper.  This movie provides a comedy that keeps the comedy clean without being offensive or over the line.

Pat has been institutionalized because he caught his wife, Nikki, with another man.  And then proceded to beat that man near to death.  Once out, Pat's friend's wife Veronica tries to set him up with Tiffany, an equally-troubled widow who uses dance to cope with her demons.  Figuring he could be charitable, while at the same time convince Nikki to drop the restraining order, Pat decides to help Tiffany with her dance competition, all the while trying to satisfy his father's belief that Pat is the key to a Philadelphia Eagles victory of the Cowboys.

When you get right down to it, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a romantic comedy.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it's not even that romantic, yet that's exactly what the film is.  It's a bit predictable, too, despite writer/director David O. Russell's best efforts.  His previous film, THE FIGHTER, was also a genre piece that more or less stuck to conventions; that film was a superior outing, perhaps due to its grittier subject matter.  PLAYBOOK does try to dig beneath the skin; this is most visible in the scenes between leads Bradley Cooper (who would have won the Oscar if Daniel Day-Lewis hadn't been nominated), and Jennifer Lawrence (who did win the Oscar, even if she deserved it more two years ago for A WINTER'S BONE).  The actors are game for the material; the script starts out strong, bogs down in the middle, then picks up again for a beautifully unconventional dance number (I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen), and throughout the film, these two actors give it their all.  Anyone who only knows Cooper from THE HANGOVER should take note, and anyone who identifies Jennifer Lawrence solely with THE HUNGER GAMES should pull themselves out of puberty for a minute.  (Okay, that's unfair.  The book was actually pretty grown up.)

Cooper and Lawrence aren't the only two here, however.  Jacki Weaver, as Pat's mom, is a subtle wonder (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, for what it's worth); she doesn't do much, but what she does is terrific.  Julia Stiles is great in her limited role, as is (surprisingly) Chris Tucker.  Shea Wigham continues to get work as Pat's brother; one of these days, he'll be a leading man in his own right, but for now it's nice to see him wherever he pops up.  The true wonder among the supporting cast, however, is Robert De Niro, nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  De Niro isn't as good as he was in his heyday, but this is the best he's been in a long time, and his character is one of the more interesting ones in the film.  His relationship with Pat isn't explored as thoroughly as it should've been, and that is one of the film's many flaws.  SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK aims high; as such, when it falls flat, one can't help but notice.  But what's here is worth watching, if only for the caliber of performances features.  It may not be a whole lot more than an actor's piece...but hey, there are worse things in the world.  They're making another TRANSFORMERS movie, after all.",1367712000,2,3112,4.707948243992607

The first is falling down a ditch and clawing your way out of it.  Secondly it's about two bent but not broken hearts who are desperately right for one another and the awkward path they take in coming to that realization.  Mental illness is a tricky theme to portray but writer-director David O. Russell in conjunction with his main actors, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, pull it off beautifully with sensitivity and great wit and insight.  Cooper and Lawrence should be applauded for getting the tone right for their characters and not overplaying it.  We forget we are watching actors giving a performance but people like us trying to cope with the slings and arrows that burden us.  Last year was a terrific year for American film.

It is actually Painful to watch for the first 45 minutes as you see a marvelous assemblage of actors doing their best with truly aweful dialog and an equally poor plotline. One can only imagine how good it would have been if the inept producers had spent 1/10th the effort that the casting director did (the true unsung hero of this movie) finding an actual script.

One wonders if this production was the result of a bet among the studio big wigs after indulging in too much wacky weed. I imagine the scenario as something like this:

""You know, put the right stars in a movie and you can sell ANY story."" ""Really...? How about a bi-polar loser straight out of a psyche ward after he messes up his otherwise sub-par life.... and we'll make him a self-absorbed jerk..."" ""Oooh!.... an Obsessive self absorbed jerk!"" ""Really? Does that even exis.... OK sure! why not?""

Right! Cool!.... (pass that joint back here)... And let's see if we can get some of the Best names in the acting business and give them some seriously two dimensional characters to play just to see if they can salvage this mess."" ""OK then!

Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.

The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the ""silver linings"" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.

The entire cast is superb - including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake - and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, May 13",1367625600,2,2977,5.0304259634888435

5175615,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is the last of the Academy Award Winning films top make it to home video, but it was worth the wait for the bonus features.

As I post this review there are already 242 (!) reviews here on Amazon, but I want to point out Amazon's methodology for listing reviews. Reviews of both theatrical versions and home video are grouped under all formats. Hence, the majority of the reviews posted before this one are of the film. I always suggest that readers sort by most recent when reading reviews. Also, all formats of home video (both DVD and BD) are grouped too.  This review is of the BD+DVD+Digital version.

Obviously, with this many reviews already up about the film itself I don't need to repeat much of the info, except to say that it took me a while to get into the story since I knew nothing about the plot, just that it takes place just outside Philly - my city-, where it was filmed. There's music but it's not a musical. There are some funny moments (the diner scene is ALMOST as good as the one in ""Five Easy Pieces"") but it's not a comedy. And it takes a while to realize that it's about depression and bi-polar disorders. But once it starts the acting (especially Jennifer Lawrence - Academy Award winner!).

The BD has a slew of bonus features - some excellent; a few are throwaways. First is a group of 18 ""Deleted Scenes"" (without commentary) which totals 26 minutes. Next comes the 28-minute featurette ""The Movie That Became a Movement"" - which starts out discussing  the mental health issues with the President of the American Psychiatric Assn and TV's Dr. Oz ( oddly, in his ""hospital blues"" like he just came from the operating room!), and then moves into discussion of the music, scripts and dance choreography. It's worth watching. Next is a 27-minute Q&A held at a screening which includes Director, Writer, Producer and - from the cast - Robert DiNiro (a rare such moment). The other three ""bonuses are just ""fluff"": 1  minutes of ""dance rehearsal"" footage, 56 seconds of actor Bradley Cooper trying to use a steadicam and - if you want to learned the dance that Cooper and Lawrence do at film's conclusion - there is a ""learn to dance"" lesson by the film's choreographer that runs 11 minutes.
Overall I enjoyed the film. I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Everyone needs to see this movie.

I will add I think Bradley Cooper was robbed by Mr. Oscar, aka, Daniel Day Lewis who gets Oscars for no reason whatsoever.  Bradley Cooper deserved an Oscar for his role just as Lawrence received one for hers.  Loved every minute!!!",1367539200,,630,4.473684210526316

5175637,4,B008OGIPJA,"Wanna score points with your wife or favorite gal?  Then see ""Silver Linings Playbook"".  There are enough elements in it to even keep the guys amused.  After all you've got Bradley Cooper of ""Hangover"" fame, a classic guy flick, plus the multi faceted Robert De Niro and Chris Rock as an added comic prop.  Cooper plays 30 something Pat Solitano, released to his parents care after being institutionalized for bipolar disorder.  His goal is to resume his marriage with his estranged wife, by showing her that he can become the kind of man she wants him to be.  The problem is, he has several restaining orders against him that inhibit the reunion.  By chance through a friend he meets Tiffany(cutely played by Jennifer Lawrence)who has her own hangup of sex addiction.  They agree to help each other overcome their disorders as Tiffany is a link to Pats' reunion with his wife.  What insues are various degrees of comical mishaps that conclude in a big payoff for Pat and Tiffany, as well as Pats' gambling dad, Pat senior(De Niro).  Based on the best selling novel by Matthew Quick, which transfers well into film, don't expect anything to be truly believable.  Just enjoy it for what it is and make the girls happy.

The film in and of itself I'm sorry to say just became very stupid, and corny. If, you want to see this film, I kinda have to suggest that you should wait when it only cost $1.99 or when it's free on prime I'm sorry to say, Hollywood, has lost it's originality!

5175639,5,B008OGIPJA,Jennifer Lawrence absolutely deserves the Oscar for her performance. I can't believe that a 22 year old woman has this kind of power and depth. Bradley Cooper was totally captivating with his portrayal of a bipolar man lost in his own reality. De Niro came alive with his best performance in years. The rest of the cast was magnificent. Every once in while a movie is made that can be considered a truly delightful piece of art. This film was one of those few where that can be said.

Boy howdy, 2012 was a great year for movies. And this is one of the best of that fine crop, if perhaps the hardest to watch for anyone who's ever had to deal with these issues in their family and/or with friends. The first twenty minutes had me cringing in shared pain with Cooper's character, and I didn't know if I could take too much more. But then Russell evens out the plane and takes us on a gorgeous and touching ride through the clouds of sanity, and thereabouts.

Cooper is so good it's kind of scary at points, and as good as Lawrence is it's Cooper's film. He holds his own with DeNiro, and Bob is as good as he's been in years, so that's a high bar. All the minor roles are done to perfection, and Russell keeps things moving towards a conclusion that could feel sappy but actually plays out quite well, if a little predictably Hollywoodish.

Unsettling in many good ways, Silver Linings Playbook will go down as a classic not only for tackling a usually taboo subject, but for doing so in an oddly good-humored fashion that both delights and occasionally horrifies. And for anyone who's ever placed a crazy sports bet on a whim, the line after ""I believe in you"" will be one of the funniest things you'll ever hear.

Point taken: none of us is really entirely sane.",1367452800,,1289,4.4033613445378155

5175666,1,B008OGIPJA,"The entire story line of this film is absurd. But, for Hollywood, that's OK, so long as they can sign on several stars who are attracted to the roles (Cooper, Lawrence, DeNiro) and a marquee director - David O. Russell.

The whole thing is simply a marketing contrivance: Bradley Cooper brings the female audience; Jennifer Lawrence brings the young male audience; Robert DeNiro brings the geriatric audience.  It's a boffo date movie for young couples and old married folks.  Who cares that it's a rather unlikable mess, as long as the Weinsteins fill the seats?

As for Jennifer Lawrence, her performance was uneven at best, but the camera surely does love her face and her body, so I'm assuming that she won the Oscaar more for her future than for her actual performance.  She got lucky: she was up against actresses in three films nobody wanted to see (The Impossible, Amour and Beasts of the Southern Wild) and against Jessica Chastain, who is one of the most over-exposed and unlikable actresses currently working.

You don't need me to tell you what all is terrible, if you watch it you will see for yourself. My hope is that you don't waste time, and I'll try to give you the best reasons I can as succinctly as possible.

The acting was good. Don't get me wrong. Jennifer Lawrence proved herself to be more than I ever expected she could be from her role in the Hunger Games. She still slumped into her monotone at some points, perhaps the worst points she could, but overall she did well. Good on her. The rest of the cast was good also.

The real problem is the story. The story of this movie is quite simply absurd. You cannot relate to the characters because of how poorly they are written. There is no redemption, and for a movie about mental illness there's really no REAL emotional discomfort. The only discomfort generated was generated by having half of the dialogue yelled between angry people. That should not be your go-to tactic for creating conflict.

Even more unfortunate is that there is really no conflict resolution. The character development is forced, and the way the characters act at certain points is completely opposite to how someone would act (by the way they feel). All of this misdirection is to force a twist at the end, a big ""surprise"", but it really ruined the little the story had going for it. It would have been much more effective to throw out the silly twist at the end, perhaps the book didn't have the ridiculous ending?

The other beef I had was that the author, or at least the people who adapted the book for the movie, could not write men. Honestly. Men do not simply go crazy over an easy lay. I'm not saying men won't exploit women if they're easily available, but let's give ourselves an ounce of credit here. I saw that it was a husband-wife duo that worked on the book, perhaps the husband envisioned the female character and the wife envisioned the man? Either way, what they give us are two characters we can't relate to, who suffer mental illnesses that really don't seem to have much effect on them. I mean sure they're bizarre people, but if this is what we medicate over we have some serious issues as a society... I mean Bradley Cooper could just concentrate his problems away (apparently). If you can concentrate a problem away, it is not a mental illness that requires medication.

Anyways, I see a lot of people like the movie, I can't really understand why. I simply didn't like it, no offense intended, I know a lot of people DO like it, so you can feel free to disagree. I found it insulting to people suffering from real mental illnesses.",1367366400,4,2866,4.451428571428571
5175668,5,B008OGIPJA,"It's often said that most romantic comedies or even comedy-dramas are now more paint-by-number than actual story, and that may be true, but ""Silver Linings Playbook"" manages more depth and heart than most, and, in making both halves of the prospective whole majorly messed up, also more ""real"".

If you're reading this site, you likely have seen in other reviews just what the story involves, so this review won't bore you with repeating the synopsis. With that said, Pat Solitano and Tiffany Maxwell are two broken, messed up people, certainly not the usual people one would expect a romantic dramedy to focus upon, but that is actually what makes the movie different and special. With Pat's bipolar disease and struggle to get it under control and rebuild his life (and get his wife back, a running theme which leads to Tiffany and more than he bargained for), and Tiffany's propensity to use sex as a salve *and* an emotional shield (which even sort of plays into the guilt over her husband's death), these are not the usual people you would associate with a love story.

And this movie is a love story, but not only for Pat and Tiffany. It is a love of family, a love of dance, a love (obsessively so) of football, and, oddly, if not love, a sort of respectful nod to mental illness without making fun of it *or* miring itself in misery. Mental instability is almost its own character in the film, working its way around from Pat to Tiffany to Pat's own OCD father (brilliantly acted by Robert DeNiro) whose football superstitions rival his son's own problems, and also to Pat's friend from the mental institution (where he was forcibly remanded to for eight months after a rage incident upon discovering his cheating wife and her lover), Danny, who is well played by Chris Tucker, who teaches Pat and Tiffany a thing or two about dancing, and the craziness of falling in love with someone just as crazy as the other person. But in combining that crazy, oddly, comes stability. All of the above - besides the aforementioned DeNiro and Tucker - are pitch perfect, including Jacki Weaver, whose role as what would be just the vanilla wife and mother in any other romance movie, is filled with an extra ""something"" that allows her not to fade into the shadows against Cooper, DeNiro, or Lawrence, the latter three who, admittedly, make this movie shine. Lawrence, for being so young, shows that she is no fluke, has acting chops, and deserved that Lead Actress Oscar for her effort. The fact that Weaver, Cooper and, I believe DeNiro, were also nominated is no accident, either. A stellar cast only elevates what is already a terrific screenplay, also rare for the usual rom-com.

To be clear, Pat and Tiffany are not meant as ""poster children"" for the mentally ill, so those who may initially want to steer clear because of the subject matter can rest assured, just two people who, through circumstance, manage to merge their brand of insanity into their own form of happiness and calm and focus when together. As the message of the movie says, it's about ""reading the signs"" and, if read right, those signs can lead from dark to light, a true ""silver lining"".",1367366400,12,3162,4.714285714285714
5175669,2,B008OGIPJA,"This movie is watchable, but not anywhere near as good as I expected from all the hype. Lawrence certainly didn't deserve an Oscar, unless all the other nominees were even worse. She, Cooper, even De Niro--all just okay. No great acting, certainly no believable chemistry AT ALL.

Absurd story, unbelievable dialog, sloppy directing--and the climax at the dance contest was just ridiculously bad. The more I write the worse the movie seems, so I'll stop while I can still give it two stars. I guess the Weinstein brothers still know how to sell movies, which is the best I can say about this clunker.",1367366400,2,600,4.769230769230769
5175670,5,B008OGIPJA,"Bradley Cooper's character, a hostile but lovelorn high school teacher, wrangles an early release from institutionalized captivity on the condition that he reside with his middle aged parents (including his volatile father played by Robert De Niro), take his meds, and otherwise behave himself.  This is quite a challenge for the poor guy, still traumatized by visions of his ex-wife cavorting in the shower of their once happy home with another man--who made the discovery even worse by telling Cooper's shocked and cuckolded character ""you should leave.""  Clearly, such an interloper richly deserved a pounding--and that is indeed what he received at the hands of our protagonist--who landed in the slammer as a result--a terrible injustice if there ever was one!

So now we find our poor hero, alone except for his eccentric parents (his father a rabid Philadelphia Eagles fan banned from his beloved stadium because of a fight he once precipitated) and his good-natured shrink who hails from south Asia.  But never fear!  The up-to-now unlucky fellow soon stumbles upon Jennifer Laurence's hot and emotionally-damaged widow next door--whose caustic and often lewd observations complete her persona as something that dreams are made of!  Sadly, however, Cooper's still traumatized and seethingly hostile fellow only has eyes (in his imagination anyway) for the ex-wife who has placed a restraining order on him!  Still, the two immediately click, and in a way that is reminiscent of two socially-challenged high school kids--with him as the guy who's too stuck on the head cheerleader to notice the hot girl next door making eyes at him!

Fear not, however!  She soon cons him into becoming her partner in a dance contest.  What's more, his old prison buddy, played wonderfully by a charming Chris Tucker, gamely teaches them how to ""black it up"" for their dance routine.  Jesus!  How Cooper's character is able to keep his hand off his now sensually gyrating dance partner (other than in a quasi-platonic dance-move way) defies the imagination!  But hey, the guy IS crazy after all!  You begin to wonder if he will EVER snap out of it!  And that's the hook of this show.  Will true love win out?  See this movie and find out!  I highly recommend it!!",1367366400,,2254,5.0296495956873315
5175671,4,B008OGIPJA,"This is a wonderful film about broken people trying to find wholeness and healing.  It is funny and real and smart.  The superb performances from lead and supporting actors elevate it to the level of minor classic along the lines of As Good As It Gets.  At times it's painful to watch the struggles of the main characters, but ultimately it's a satisfying, feel-good film that does not resort to cliche.

My favorite moment is the reaction of Bradley Cooper's character Pat to finishing the novel A Farewell to Arms.  I am not a Hemingway fan and fell in love with the movie right then and there.",1367366400,3,596,4.5327102803738315

The actors are all believable in their roles and make you feel very sympathetic to their situations. Bradley Cooper especially did a very good job portraying someone with Bipolar Disorder who is still struggling to find solid footing again after his diagnosis. The chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence is easy and sweet, and while the love story is nice it does not take over the whole movie and turn it into a mushy rom-com. I really liked it.",1367366400,,542,4.597938144329897
5175673,5,B008OGIPJA,"I read Mr. Munro's review on 'Silver Linings Playbook' and had to laugh. There are always people like you in every review
category rather it be music, a book, or (in this case) a movie. My wife and I actually went on a date night to see this wonderful movie and she is not one for a movie that swears a lot or movies that are loud, she likes chick flicks. We also had to go out of out of town because the theaters were we live are prudish (as you seem to be) when it comes to movies dealing with reality.
Mental illness is a terrible issue on all levels but 'Silver Linings Playbook' took the chance to let the public know what people who suffer from these deceases have to go through. I love this movie because it's honest, direct to the point, and the acting was amazing. No, Bradley Cooper did not overact on any level in this movie. He played his part to the tee. Jennifer Laurence played her role just as well.
My only advice to Mr. Andrew I. Munro Sr, myself being completely blown away by his reaction to this great movie, is to wait for a good Walt Disney movie to come out to go out for a date night (did you see 'Wreck it Ralph'). You are definitely not mature enough to live in the 21st century. It seems a bit to real for you. O' by the way, what were the ratings on 'Silver linings Playbook' at the time of my response?

5175677,4,B008OGIPJA,"A romantic Comedy/Drama with a couple of families where more than one family member has mental health issues.  Enjoyable movie, solid 8/10. There is tons of understated very smart humor in this movie.  I think casting two of the top ten most beautiful people in Hollywood both with mental issues was a mistake, it's hard to buy what they are selling.  He is harassed into friendship by this smoking hot girl played by Lawrence, as Pat (Bradley) pines for his old fuddy duddy wife who cheated on him and continues to live with the man she cheated on Pat with, as Pat tries to make amends with his wife.  As Pat is continually bothered by smoking hot Lawrence, and he continues to push her away.  Enjoyable good movie, but again hard to buy what they were selling.

 I thought Bradley was excellent in this movie, as were his parents who were well cast. Jennifer did just OK but wow is she hot, she was inconsistant.  Recomended.  I have yet to see Argo, but I'm assuming Argo is more oscar worthy.",1367366400,,996,4.488888888888889

5175683,5,B008OGIPJA,"I didn't expect to like this film since I've disliked Bradley Cooper's past roles and because the script sounded shallow and formulaic. Initially, I thought they'd included De Niro as a come-on. In fact, the only reason I saw the film was because of Jennifer Lawrence, whose sophisticated performance in WINTER'S BONE convinced me I'd seen the breakthrough of a gifted actress.

Well, I was wrong about Cooper, wrong about De Niro's inclusion, wrong about a formulaic script, and dead-on about Jennifer Lawrence.  Simply stated, this quirky, brilliant story of the evolution of love between two world-worn, emotionally troubled people -- against the chaotic background of family madness -- was one of the most satisfying, funny and affecting movies I've seen in recent years. In terms of clarity, continuity and heart, it surpasses the book on which it was based.

Since others have described the plot on this page, I will say that millions of viewers who have not seen the film will find parts of their emotional lives in the trials of the lead characters. They will marvel at Bradley Cooper's jaw-dropping portrayal of of a man shackled by the manic phase of bipolar disorder. They will wince at those moments in which the love between the principals starts to emerge, and falters. They will discover a performance by Lawrence that is comfortably sensual, and an actress who is equally powerful whether she is mute or screaming.

The script is complex and masterfully written, with surprising outburst of pathos and hilarity. The climax of the film -- and I won't enter a spoiler here -- caught me by surprise.  I wept at the beauty of it, the director's mastery of realism, and the restoration of originality and complexity to American comedy.

It may be that we're all fundamentally ""crazy"" and that these two lovers legitimize the chaos we feel inside.  It may also be that the art direction, score, supporting performances (De Niro is simply wonderful) and choreography are jaw-dropping.  In the end, it's the confluence of so many virtues that make this film as fine as it is. For Bradley Cooper, it's a career-defining moment  For Jennifer Lawrence, it's confirmation of what the wise always believed, and hopefully she'll be spared casting in horror films in perpetuity. She is one of our very best, and her beauty, grace and innate power to inhabit the souls of her characters -- are most unusual.

While I've enjoyed it once, I plan to view it again tomorrow evening, will continue to discuss it with friends, and add it to my list of favorites.

That's not bad at all.

Another patient wants a ride home, but Delores finds out he is not released. Home they go to Pat, Sr played by Robert  DeNiro. This may be Deniro's best role in awhile. He plays an obsessed Philly Eagles fan, he bets money and runs an illegal game. He can't go to the stadium because he was kicked out for fighting. Pat, Jr 's goal is to get back with his wife. He caused some violence in their marriage and went for therapy in Baltimore in lieu of jail. He has been diagnosed as Bi-polar. The family obsessed!

She has a goal to enter a dance contest and needs a partner, enter, Pat Jr. A rollicking funny, fast , sad time ensues, and we meet more family and friends. This is a love story and a story about people with problems who try to find their way.

Silver linings playbook is the story of two people Pat and Tiffany struggling with emotional issues and desperately in love with their unattainable spouses: both feel responsible for the incidents that separated them from their first loves. From the moment they set eyes on each other the chemistry is electric. Much of the humor is due to the fact that neither has much of a filter, yet both have a vulnerability and kindness, in addition to a keen intellect and sharp wit.

The family relationship between Pat and his mother and his OCD father (played by Robert Di Niro, brilliant as always) is vocal and intense and at times hilarious.

I was wrong, it was fabulous all around, from the leads (Cooper, Lawrence, De Niro & Weaver) to the smaller roles (Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Julia Stiles, etc...)  When the acting is universally good, you have to give the director some credit.  That said, the story line was more formulaic than I expected and I felt these characters were deserving of a bit ""darker"" mood, if that makes sense (e.g., Precious), so that their ultimate redemption would be more rewarding.  Instead, the backstory and mental instability that the Cooper and Lawrence characters bring to the table seems misplaced in what is essentially a rom-com.",1366761600,,728,4.942622950819672

We were also misled to be under the impression this movie was going to deal with mature, dark, topics that usually remained 'in the closet' until now- Mental Illness! We found it just brushed up against mental illness over a few short conversations or arguments within the film. I don't feel it really dealt with it in a mature manner like those who deal with it on a daily basis do with a real, honest understanding. I was hoping for a more in-depth realistic look into the life.  Very disappointed as we were with Jennifer Lawrence acting abilities, I don't understand how she could be considered for anything from what was seen in that movie- maybe they haven't seen her in anything else realizing that is how she always behaves, speaks and just is.... She didn't seem any different to me of a character to me then she did in her previous movie. Her attitude is horrible as well, very disappointing for a young woman in Hollywood today.

5175725,4,B008OGIPJA,"I really wanted to like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK and, for the most part, I did...primarily because of the performances of the actors...rather than the screenplay, which I felt was overlong, often convoluted and forced.

(I realize that I hold a minority opinion here.  Even my wife disagrees with me, but I have to call `em as I see `em.)

From a positive standpoint, this film probably has the finest ensemble cast of 2012.  Jennifer Lawrence certainly deserved her ""Best Actress"" Oscar, and it's a shame that Bradley Cooper had to be up the same year as Daniel Day-Lewis' ""Abraham Lincoln"".  His performance grabbed me from the opening scene and held me throughout.  Jackie Weaver is quietly marvelous as Cooper's mother, and as his book-making father, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance in years.

The film opens with Cooper being released into the custody of his parents, after spending eight months in a state mental institution, the result of a plea bargain.  He had come home from work one day to find his wife in the shower with another man, so like any other red-blooded husband, he beat the crap out of the guy.

Cooper is determined to put his life back together and win back his wife, even though she has a restraining order against him.  Then, he meets Jennifer Lawrence, a young widow with her own set of problems, and they develop an initially disquieting relationship.

For the first half hour or so, director-screenwriter David O. Russell creates an entertaining dramedy with SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, as we meet Cooper and his dysfunctional family, then awhile later, Lawrence.  The dynamics between all of these characters remains engrossing for most of the picture, but after the introductions and initial encounters, Russell, who adapted the novel by Matthew Quick, does not seem to know how to develop the action in a believable manner.  Part of the problem is that there are too many secondary, albeit well-played, characters in this film resulting in the screenplay occasionally losing its focus.

The final twenty minutes of the movie, involving a large bet on a football game and a dance contest, does not ring true, nor does the scene leading up to it.

Nevertheless, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than the actors, all of who are extremely likable.

The Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including several deleted scenes, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, one of which involves a close look at the dance rehearsals between Cooper and Lawrence.

5175736,2,B008OGIPJA,"Premise: married male teacher comes home to find his wife in teh shower having sex with another teacher. (They are all teachers by the way.) Married guy ""Snaps"" and beats the adulterer so badly he almost dies and has to be hopsitalized. Married guy cops a plea withe courts, not for anger management therapy, but to be put in a mental hospital. Married guy gets out after 8 months and wants to get his wife back. Instead he meets a widow whose husband dies in a car accident on the way back to her with some lingerie to get her to have sex with him as she has been ""depressed"" and ""distant"". She therefore ""snaps"" at his beloved husband's death and her guilt over being sex and not giving him sex and goes and has sex with everyone and anyone. She lives close to the ex mental patient married guy. They meet and fall in love.

Message: Crazy is normal is what this movie was trying sell. The characters even say so. They tell their families as the families didn't ""snap"" and do crazy stuff and get locked up for it or get fired for it or lose everything they have because of it that they are the real psychotic one and psychotic characters are really the sane, normal ones who are ""living"". For example, the married guy's dad we learn beat up people at a football game and therefore is barred from the stadium for life. So naturally because he now lives with his wife in their house and comfortably and likes family an d football he is not being ""real"" as he has not been discovered as psychotic like his son was. The sexaholic's brother-in-law lives in misery as he is henpecked by the sexaholic's sister. So of course since they don't talk and just grumble behind each other's backs they are the real psychotic ones, not the sexaholic or the angry out of control guy. They even take this theme one step further. The angry crazy guy really isn't crazy. It is just learned behavior from the father and because the older brother is favored and because the crazy guy has low self-esteem. Movie moral: if you have a feeling run with it to the extreme otherwise you are repressing yourself and cause yourself harm. Don't bother with maturity and learning to deal with your emotions. Just let'er fly.

Also as with all Bradley Cooper movies I have seen you have the liberal moralizing. You have Asian Indians being made fun of be those ""evil white people"" (those ""other"" white people) at the ball game. Some Philadelphia rednecks sees the bus of Asian Indians tailgating and cooking curry and says somethingn about how stinky it is. So naturally it is OK to go into a rage and beat up the guy because ""we all know all non-white Americans are just victims waiting to happen and by the victimizer evil white man"".

The two characters are just self-centered and foul mouthed. I wouldn't even want to know them let alone cheer for them to get together in the end . . . but we are supposed to. We are supposed to be their advocates much in the same way we were told to support the weird ""Little Miss Sunshine"" family. Because again ""normal is crazy. Crazy is normal."" ""We are never to blame for our behavior . . . it is always someone else's or something's fault . . . infidelity. . . a death . . . etc.""

The movie was very sloppy even in delivering its message. Which is it? The guy is not crazy and the pills make him numb. Or in reality he is really crazy after beating up his mother and get somewhat normal after being forced to take the pills? We get it both ways . . . kinda just thrown at us.  The dance . . . . Uh . . . nothing really to say there but we are supposed to be impressed by their ""hard work"" preparing for a dance competition. But in reality it looks sloppy and stupid, even for the role it plays in the movie. He isn't going to keep his promise to go rehearse but instead go to the game. No wait he is. No wait he didn't. But she is OK with it. What??? Again just sloppy delivery.

But outside of liberal hotbeds most of us know that these characters are just losers. No tears are shed except for the $14.99 you have to pay to see this now before the paying the newly increased price of a VOD rental on Amazon of $3.99/4.99.

5175745,1,B008OGIPJA,"When I first heard about this film, I was told it was a romantic comedy where two people who are a little different find love.  You know, that sounds lovely.  However, this film is really a false portrayal of hope.  It perpetuates the ill-conceived notion that people with mental illnesses will be cured simply by getting exercise and being happy.  The ""comedy"" in this film is a highly dysfunctional family unraveling. Watching people with serious mental affliction go through agonizing difficulties? It isn't funny.  Everyone who says this movie is uplifting and wonderful has clearly never been in a dangerous situation with a person suffering from mental illness.  Anyone who has been around people who suffer will find this film exceedingly triggering.  It is insulting that it keeps the misconception that turning a frown upside-down will cure depression.  It is ludicrous that the message spread here is that finding love will cure your broken psyche.  it is infuriating that all of the characters get down on the main character for his mental illness, while never openly acknowledging that the father is also suffering from rather pronounced mental issues himself.

As for the acting, there are some truly brilliant portrayals of people suffering through mental illness and broken families.  This doesn't change the fact that screaming in a diner is nowhere near as Oscar-worthy as portraying the progression of a series of strokes.  Other films and performances went unrecognized because people jumped on the ""mind over matter and we'll all be okay!"" bandwagon.  This film portrays a false hope, which might lead some people with mental affliction to believe that they, too will be cured if they go for a jog and get sexy with a neighbor.  While it is certainly possible for people suffering from mental illness to find love and be in a long-term loving relationship, those relationships do not cure the mental illness.  This film pokes fun at mental illness and unstable family situations while simultaneously sending the message that illness magically disappears if you learn to be happy.  This is insulting, and everyone who thinks this film is the best thing since toast and tea should really read some books about the reality of mental illnesses and stop buying into the mass delusion that people simply choose to have mental affliction.",1366070400,34,2351,5.083333333333333

I think this is one of the few perfect movies out there.  The film is a smart, real (as in get real) character study about two mentally ill folks making it work.  I like to say it's dirty dancing with the roles reversed and everyone is crazy.  But for myself, especially, this movie has a really great meaning and message. The meaning is it can happen for you and the message is that love, and practice is what is needed.  The dancing in this movie is sublime.

Cooper was perfect in conveying a real complex of anger, impatience and desperation to which I can say, watching this character is like I am looking in the mirror.  Except in the film, love is the thing that wins against this complex.  Maybe the silver lining is it can happen for you also, hence playbook.  I just need to find myself a Jennifer Lawrence.

5175751,5,B008OGIPJA,"The latest craze seems to be the film Silver Linings Playbook, which began as a small independent film with limited release, and grew to amass a box office return more than 10 times its budget (at the time of writing).  I saw this movie in theater just after it made it to my town in January and was blown away by the acting by the always-complex Jennifer Lawrence and the usually-shallow Bradley Cooper.  Perhaps as intriguing, the film is based on the 2008 debut-novel by Matthew Quick.

The biggest surprise had to be Bradley Cooper's performance.  In my opinion, this is the first role he's played that truly had any amount of depth.  His character had a number of mental illnesses that prohibited him (and his family) from leading a normal life.  His goal is to get his act together and get his wife to take him back.  He plans to do this by finding the ""silver linings"" in everything, essentially finding small positive ways to look at every situation.  This isn't easy, as he has anger issues on top of his other disorders.  Hope seems lost, until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).

Tiffany is another example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG), which I've discussed in previous posts.  The story is less about her personality and mental disorders, and more about how her presence helps Patrick (Bradley Cooper) get his life back.  It's rare with the MPDG motif that the girl actually is manic from a mental illness.  In this case, the motif just plain works.  Tiffany and Patrick are right for each other on so many levels, the audience is rooting for them from the start.",1365120000,,1586,4.637992831541219

Russell has lost the courage of his convictions.  The premise is an original one: Bradley Cooper's bipolar life-wrecker Pat has to come to terms with living in the community once more after eight months incarceration, and teams up - chiefly due to his mother's machinations - with Jennifer Lawrence's equally disturbed widow Tiffany.  The two of them have a stormy relationship which goes through fits and starts until they start rehearsing for a dance competition.  The camerawork at the beginning is excellent, with the use of a handheld camera coming uncomfortably close to the actors' faces to signify how Pat and Tiffany's mood-shifts can have destructive effects on those around them.  As the film unfolds, however, so the study of bipolar disorder gets lost, and we are plunged instead into a romcom that culminates on the dance-floor, rather in the manner of Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM from the Nineties.  The end is predictable.  Director Russell also wastes the opportunity to explore the relationship between Pat and his father (Robert de Niro), an equally obsessive addict of the Philadelphia Eagles.  One wonders whether the father's OCD did not impinge upon his son, but the connection is not taken up.  SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is certainly watchable, but represents something of a missed opportunity.",1365033600,8,1474,5.189873417721519

Movies are NEVER as good as the books. Just get used to that fact.

Also, everyone's experience with mental illness is different. Just because this isn't yours, doesn't mean it's wrong. I am bipolar and have multiple family members who are bipolar, and yes, the movie characters were an accurate representation of my personal experience with bipolar to the point where I was laughing with my mother when these characters were acting manic because members of my family have done the same exact thing, like looking for something completely unimportant in the middle of the night and NEEDED it then(the wedding video). (Mania is an diagnosing factor in bipolar disorder)

IF you did your research before seeing it- which I did- you would know that these characters were based on truly bipolar people. The director's son is bipolar. If you do not think this is an accurate representation and you are actually bipolar, you need to do some research, my friend. Talk to your psychiatrist. It's actually quite interesting- but I'm majoring in Psychology, though, so I'm a tad biased.

I enjoyed this movie. There was not a dull moment in it. The characters were well thought out and very well portrayed and acted. (I am singing praise for Jennifer Lawrence and bradley Cooper!) They had the way you talk when you are manic down perfectly, so they obviously did their research. Also, they even had Bradley Cooper's eyes DILATED. Bravo! (For those of you who don't know- the medicine he was taking makes your eyes dilated.)

Thank you, cast and crew of Silver Linings Playbook for a stellar movie that I have seen four times and so many more to come. This is now my favorite movie.",1364947200,12,1865,4.746913580246914

But lately, I have come to a startling conclusion: the movies I sometimes overlook or forget about are the ones that are better or that I should be watching. That Said, Silver Linings Playbook is a great movie. The movie stars Bradley Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. I have to say not only was I glad that Jennifer Lawrence win the much deserved Academy award, but Bradley Cooper gives a surprisingly  great performance. The Chemistry their characters(Pat & Tiffany) have is almost instant and stays that way the entire movie.
Some supporting cast include Robert De Niro(who was nominated for his role and has a very memorable quote in the movie that to this day is still stuck in my head), Chris Tucker(who did a great job as well) Jacki Weaver; Julia Stiles is also in SLP. I need not tell you that the supporting cast all did an amazing job in this movie.
The Storyline is realistic as it is relatable. David O Russell did a Wonderful job crafting, and directing Silver Linings Playbook.
2012 was one of the best years (in a long time) for books being adapted into movies. Silver Linings Playbook is one of (if not the main) reason why. In my opinion, it did what very few of the other Oscar nominated movies could do: Live up to the hype.
Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt, an extremely remarkable movie that will be with you even after the movie is over.

5175756,5,B008OGIPJA,"Living with this illness myself, I found ""Silver Linings Playbook"" a reasonably accurate representation of the inside of Bi-Polar Disorder.  It is not romanticized but, rather, looked at ""full scope"" with affects on not only the protagonist with the disorder but upon family and friends.  The roots of the pathology is shown clearly through the father's obsessions and emotions, played authentically, sensitively and well by Robert DeNiro.  The inside jokes of the BPD couple are so familiar and the edge upon which those with BPD reside excellently portrayed.

I would recommend this film not for an easy viewing or a heartwarming touch but for the as-accurate-as-Hollywood-can-get-it picture of what it is like to live with Bi-Polar Disorder.  There are many living with this illness everyday - I, for one, felt a kinship and some comfort with this film.  Our brains maybe wired differently and sometimes destructively, but there is creativity and love amidst it all.  For that representation, I am deeply appreciative to ""Silver Linings Playbook"".",1364774400,4,1050,5.289156626506024
5175757,5,B008OGIPJA,"People love stories about broken people falling in love. It gives us hope that no matter how rotten and screwed-up our lives become, we can still find our soulmate.

And ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is an example of this sort of movie at its best -- a heartbreaking, heartwarming little story about romance, family, football and mental illness. Director David O. Russell is in absolutely brilliant shape her, and he spins up deeply flawed characters who are nevertheless lovable and charming. Also, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are simply stunning as a pair of lost souls who connect over dancing and football.

For eight months, Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper) has been in a mental health facility in Baltimore, being treated for bipolar disorder. Why? Because he went postal and beat his wife Nikki's lover, losing his home, job and marriage in one fell swoop. Now Nikki has a restraining order on Pat, but he's still convinced that she's going to welcome him back once he gets himself back together with exercise and classic literature.

He's released into the custody of his parents, and quickly learns that his dad Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) is now a bookie, and insists that his son is a good luck charm for the Philadelphia Eagles. And when his friend Ronnie invites him to dinner, he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law Tiffany (Lawrence), a blunt young widow with her own personal demons (and more than a hint of sex addiction).

Tiffany offers to help Pat contact Nikki via a letter, if he is her partner for an upcoming dance competition. But after the Eagles lose a game -- and Pat Sr. is about to lose his dream of opening a restaurant -- Tiffany and Pat become embroiled in a double-layered bet. But will their growing feelings for each other end up derailing everything?

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a movie that wears both sadness and happiness on its sleeve -- the characters have so much to struggle with, and so many obstacles to overcome. it just breaks your heart to see Pat's delusional belief that Nikki is just waiting for him. It hurts. And yet at the same time, the slow-blooming, almost imperceptible romance between Pat and Tiffany charms you into hoping for... if not a happy ending, then at least a happy new beginning.

David O. Russell mixes together the right proportions of comedy, tragedy and romance, with lots of snappy dialogue (""You let me lie to you for a WEEK?"" ""I was trying to be romantic"") and quirky stuff (Pat Sr.'s superstitions). And he films the entire movie in a gritty, realistic style that you don't find in many romantic comedy movies, which only highlights the raw emotions that his actors are putting out.

Russell's crowning achievement is the dance competition, when everything -- both personally and financially -- is laid on the line. Not only is it beautifully choreographed (complete with a a rock'n'roll interlude with ""Fell in Love With A Girl""), but it's supercharged with emotion.

And the actors are in brilliant shape here. I've never been a fan of Cooper, but his heartfelt depiction of an optimistic, erratic man who has lost everything just swept me away. And Lawrence shows her artistic chops by playing the kind of role that many actresses twice her age could never manage -- a blunt young woman who hides all her pain until she's faced with losing love all over again. They have kinetic, dynamic chemistry that leaves you screaming for them to get together.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is that rare dramedy that really tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you characters that are both heartfelt and quirky. And it makes you hope that, just maybe, love is something attainable.",1364601600,8,3639,4.837620578778135

I saw this movie in Theaters, but I definitely plan on buying the Blu-ray also.

I guess you can say I'm somewhat picky when it comes to which Blu-rays I buy. Either the graphics have to be GORGEOUS, like Avatar, Battleship, Total Recall, etc. Or it has to be a really good movie.

Jennifer Lawrence did an outstanding job as Tiffany Maxwell she STOLE every scene. At the same time, Bradley Cooper was amazing (I'm not even a Cooper fan, his movies are OK)  and he was also a scene Stealer. When they were in scenes together?

Jennifer Lawrence was beyond amazing and she truly truly deserved that Oscar and I was beyond happy when she won. Bradley Cooper was so amazing as well and really played the part of Pat perfectly.

The movie was so real and endearing. The movie is probably something that many people can relate to and it really handled the topic of bipolar disorder with a lot of dignity. At the same time there was just the right amount of humor put into the movies at the right times. The chemistry between Jennifer and Bradley was undeniable and they worked so well with each other. Cant wait to see the other two movies with them in it.

The dialogue was smart, witty, and hilarious when it was supposed to be. Each character in the movie ws so endearing in their own way and had such cute and funny quirks.

Not long ago, we were talking about movies, especially those with a psychological theme.

I wondered about the reality of the portrayal of mania, as Bradley swings from charming to dangerous in seconds. my friend says they were right on the money, and he discusses this film in his Psych classes.

By the way, the guys are real, the football stuff is right on the money, the guy dialogue is REAL, and Bradley Cooper is amazing. Robert DiNiro is the frosting on the cake. The back story of DiNiro's character with his own problems leaves us wanting more, and is interesting enough to deserve it's own film.

5175766,5,B008OGIPJA,"Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen.  It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character.  By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor.  By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.

Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care.  Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order.  He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement.  When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks.  One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone.  Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife.  What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.

The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors.  Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly nave, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone.  DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is.  Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.

The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life.  The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism.  When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger.  He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive.  Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if `this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the `silver lining' in his life.

It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees.  At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is.  Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.

When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor.  Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director.  His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization.  His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong storylines.  Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.",1362873600,2,3776,4.9335443037974684
5175767,4,B008OGIPJA,"Why you shouldn't see it:

I've never been to Philadelphia. I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.

Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly... then they're awesome).

You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.

Why you should see it:

I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.

Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing jerks in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's a jerk in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails... Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his jerk personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.

You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky... go figure).

Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.

In short:

I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie;
- anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie;
- if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies;
- people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems;
- anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments;
- if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love.",1362873600,2,5232,4.627155172413793

High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.

As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time.

At 21, Jennifer Lawrence (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B00498YZH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>) would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.

Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of his Ben Stiller partnerships. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Kingdom/dp/B004GGLVAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Kingdom</a>) effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles.  As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Hour/dp/B003A3R1E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush Hour</a>) is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mona-Lisa-Smile/dp/B00170KA0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mona Lisa Smile</a>) shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status-conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.",1362182400,4,4333,7.74949494949495
5175772,4,B008OGIPJA,"A true sense of mimicry in every aspect. Any film aficionado understands that both art and life reflect on both canvas and film. David O'Russell captures true life within each frame and allows you to feel good about it. He ask the viewer to understand that there is a method to his madness and in the art of philosophy answers the question, ""If a sane man were in an insane world would he be considered insane?"" In ""Silver Lining Playbook"" we find our character, Pat Solitano trying his best to hold on to his sanity and sense of optimism while constantly being bombarded by the downtrodden failures of those who surround him. Suffering from his own disappointments we began to understand why and what it was that had driven him to the brink of madness.

Bradley Cooper's performance once again proves his worth as he looses himself within the script of ""Silver Linings Playbook"", giving the audience an in your face point of view as Pat Solitano while allowing the cast of this well articulated masterpiece to compliment each other was pure perfection. Seeing Pat Sr. played by Robert De Niro enforced the idea that while family can be a burden they can also be a blessing and in my opinion both Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro's performances were deserving of an Oscar. Even the young Jennifer Lawrence brought magic to the screen as she played our heroine, ""Tiffany"". Reaching out to what seems to be a hopeless cause our two characters begin to understand not everything is the way we would have it. However with a little bit of sweat, hard work and determination we can find what we need when we need it and enjoy those all to few moments in which bliss allows us a chance to overcome.

""Silver Lining Playbook"" receives a **** and a half star rating for all of the constellations lining up just right. Anyway, Take care and enjoy, Joshua C.

5175773,5,B008OGIPJA,"As someone living with bipolar disorder with family members that also suffer from mental disorders such as the same and obsessive compulsive disorder, it was very hard for me to watch this movie. I just saw it for a second time and it wasn't any easier.

I don't know how to describe exactly how this movie makes me feel. It's very emotional and powerful for me. It doesn't make me sad. It doesn't make me happy. But at the end of the movie I'm ready to walk out with a smile on my face. The undying optimism is something that, in a depressive phase, we don't have. So it was nice to have bipolar disorder treated less like depression and more of what it really is: a lot of misery with a lot of hope.

I fervently argue that this movie deserved every Oscar nomination that it got. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job, and Jennifer Lawrence... I completely forgot she was in the Hunger Games while watching this. She was a real woman in this movie and showed a genuine break-out performance. De Niro and Weaver are a great supporting team and make the dysfunctional family dynamic come to life.

I see tons of complaints that the ending assumes that, ""Oh, they fell in love, they'll be okay."" I'd like to let you know that that's simply not the case. It's the end of a delusion for Pat. It's the end of an era of misery for Tiffany. You have to assume that of course, their illnesses will cause struggle as time goes on, but right now they're content. And when living with a mental illness, that's what you want. Stability and content.

5175774,5,B008OGIPJA,"When you want to watch a movie again the moment its over, that's something special. Have no second thoughts here, my friends, this is the movie you're expecting. If you're interested in movies with intelligent, witty dialogue with performances that exceed even YOUR incredibly high expectations, Silver Linings Playbook is the I Ching of 2012. Director/writer David O. Russel showed us with The Fighter and now he shows us with this film that he can take you to the lowest aspects of a human's personality in a very real way and still have you care and even identify with what you're seeing on screen. In a world where most films you see nowadays struggle to hold your attention with fast paced editing and over the top CG special effects, Russel manages to tell a simple narrative about a guy coming home from a mental hospital and somehow make it the most entertaining things you'll see this year. By giving it a multitude of depth and subtext to its characters, Russel creates a portrait of a family trying to deal with their clinically deemed crazy family member while also refusing to acknowledge the little bit of crazy inherent in each and every one of us. Toss in Jennifer Lawrence in the best performance of her early career for good measure and you have a recipe for the perfect blend of deliciously delivered drama.  If you love character based stories with lots of honest humor and a huge heaping dose of humanity's best and worst, by all means, buy this movie. You'd be crazy not to.",1362096000,,1496,4.666666666666667
5175775,5,B008OGIPJA,"I was not very impressed when I saw the trailer for Silver Linings Playbook. The film seemed to be more of a quirky romantic comedy with not a lot of substance. My initial opinion changed when I saw the film.  What changed my mind were the very strong performances.

There was an immediate connection with Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), recently diagnosed as a bipolar person, who has lost everything (his house, his job and his wife) been in a state institution for eight months and is now living with his parents (magnificently played by Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro).  Pat, however, is optimistic, looking for a silver lining to his problems, that he can rebuild his life and reunite with his wife, in spite of her infidelity that sparked everything.  Pats father only wants him to share his obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles.

The turning point for Pat comes when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who also has had her share of life changing problems.  Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife but he must do something for her in return  enter a dance competition.  It is a joy to watch as Pat and Tiffany begin to trust each other and slowly fall in love. The film is an honest portrayal of mental illness with very strong performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. One only has to watch the scene when the couple goes out to dinner for the first time to gauge the excellence of their performances.  The goal of acting is to convince the audience that you are not watching a performance.  The actors are their characters down to every detail.  The excellent screenplay delivers on the dark and comic moments with dialogue that is true to life. The scenes with the ballroom dancing are superbly acted and fun to watch.  Silver Linings Playbook is an honest look at loss and starting over again.",1362009600,2,1830,4.702194357366771

This dysfunctional family composed of an obsessive compulsive father, his bi-polar son, and the long suffering mother holding them together couldn't have been portrayed more perfectly, or been more expertly acted. Silver Linings Playbook is sweet, sometimes endearing, hilarious, heart warming, at certain points relatable (in a strange way), and in the end it's triumphant.

I can easily say that this will go on to be a classic. It's emotionally charged, has a witty script, phenomenal performances, (especially Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar!) funny, and most of all, relatable. I saw this back in November when it was in limited release and I've seen it six times since then. I'm relieved that it won at least one Oscar.

5175779,5,B008OGIPJA,"Struggling and living with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I found the movie to be a beautifully subtle, accurate and honest portrayal of mental illness...I was not expecting laughs or a romantic comedy, nor a clinical dissection of bipolar disorder and depression...I was not sure what to expect, but I deeply related and recognized parts of my life in the story and its characters...Pat's episode leaving him with the task of putting his life back together and starting over, probably not for the last time...having to move back and live with parents that many times feel helpless when they don't know, as much as we don't know, what we need...unemployment, failed relationships, feeling 'less than', different, like we don't fit in...the older than our years wisdom that we acquire from years of suffering, dealing with our demons and doing ""a lot of therapy"", the long list of medications we have tried looking for something that works and learning to accept the side effects, the realization that we are not the only ones with issues, that we are all, in the end, just human beings and everyone around us is struggling with something and that we all have our strengths and weaknesses....

My favorite part was the powerful scene towards the end of the film where they (**SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT***) get a low score on their dance routine and are happy and ecstatic despite not meeting the standards of the competition....I was so touched by that scene and such a heavy load was lifted off my shoulders...the scene was, to me, a powerful reminder that we do not have to meet the expectations of others or be what society considers ""normal"" or ""successful""...all we have to do is our personal best and enjoy the ride, and that alone is reason to celebrate!

It was a beautiful movie, and it helped me feel more at peace with myself than I have in years...it made me feel proud of my journey and of the fact that I am different and successful in my own way...for that, I am grateful to director David O. Russell, to his son who has struggled with mood disorders, to the amazing cast and to Matthew Quick who wrote the book from which the director adapted the screenplay :)

I can't wait to own the movie and also read the book!

""No matter what happens on Oscar night, we hope-and believe-that everyone will keep talking. Because, gold statuettes aside, contributing to this new cultural awareness is the most important silver lining of all.""- Michelle Raimo Kouyate and Rene Witt on how Silver Linings Playbook has created a national dialogue on mental illness (The Daily Beast)",1361664000,5,2608,4.761061946902655
5175780,5,B008OGIPJA,I purchased this in the Blu-Ray version for my friend who recently bought a Blu-Ray player and he had seen this movie in the theatre and welcomed the chance to make this among his first Blu-Ray purchases.,1361664000,,204,4.54054054054054
5175781,4,B008OGIPJA,"""Sliver Linings Playbook"" easily ranks among the best romantic comedies of the third millennium (eight Oscar nominations are a good proof of that). Although it contains elements of drama or psychological movie, at heart it is indeed a romance, with some fresh quirkiness, similar to films like ""Juno"" or ""Little Miss Sunshine"", thrown in.

To a wide movie-going audience, the picture rather realistically depicts the inner torture that adults go through following such stressful situations as death of a spouse or marital infidelity. First half of the movie is steeped in depicting - with sympathy and insight - the predicament of Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), who, after eight months in mental hospital for attacking his unfaithful wife, must still cope with a restraining order and fits of temper. The film's second hour, with Pat's hesitating affair with young widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) taking center stage, is even more rewarding for a viewer, with details and paradoxes of life in current America blossoming fully in the script, decently adapted from the Matthew Quick's bestseller (by director David O.Russell).

The film's main asset is the cast - every single role gets more than a capable actor to play. Bradley Cooper's natural style in a difficult role complements well with a star-making turn of Jennifer Lawrence. Solatano parents, the superstitious, illegally-bookmaking football fanatic dad (Robert DeNiro) and the anxious, ever-loving and sacrificing mom (Jacki Weaver) clearly project the movie's forgiving, understanding attitude toward its characters.

The finale makes a silver lining of its own for the story, accentuating its positive outlook on life. And although the movie cannot avoid some cliches regarding positiveness and family life misgivings, these are not overly stressed. Thinking viewers would probably welcome some more of Pat's thinking and reasoning - mainly in the final parts of the movie we must be satisfied only with some shortcuts of his mind - yet it can be safely said that ""Silver Linings Playbook"", for all its ventures into dark recesses of human soul, is a worthy addition to contemporary romantic comedy.",1361577600,,2171,5.360703812316715
5175782,2,B008OGIPJA,"Wasn't quite the touch down I was expecting, Someone may have fumbled with this one.  I went into this movie with such high hopes and enthusiasm and came out feeling a bit cheated. Thank Goodness my movie date was all that I had hoped for or the afternoon would have been a disappointment.

 After hearing so much about  this move, I anxiously went to see it. I'm not sure why there was so much Bravo's about it.  I came out of the movie not as impressed as I had hoped. Its a flick about a dysfunctional  family and  a  their emotionally disturbed son who  has been court ordered to spend some time in  mental institute after beating his ex wife's lover.  Pat, played by Bradly Cooper plays the part of a man who had a break down due to his wife cheating on him and was sent to a mental institution  for his anger and bipolar issues.  Upon his release, he get to return home to his parents home with the condition he stays away from his ex wife and continue his out patient treatment care.

 Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is emotionally disturbed in her way, yet functional in the real world had the most strength in this movie. She played her part as a tuff cookie kinda gal who doesn't give a hoot about what others think or say, and develops feelings for Bradly Cooper.

Robert DeNiro plays his father and Jackie Weaver plays his mother, or should  I say was that  Salley Struthers?  Upon  Bradly Cooper's return to his parents house, everyone seems to be walking on egg shells.  The only responsibility Pat seems to have as an adult  is to jog around  the streets in hopes to keep his head clear, and take  his meds. The one thing that seems to motivate him to stay focused is the thought of being able to speak to his wife once again and hoping to woo her back into his arms. His parents afraid to speak their minds in fear of triggering off the unstable jogger are walking around on egg shells afraid to approach him with many matters. Robert DeNiro, a football fan wants to spend time with his son  sitting and watching  the game on the television, but he son hasn't a interest in this, the son is  more  interested in jogging around the streets wrapped in a hefty garbage bag passing his ex wife's house in hopes to get a glimpse of her.  Jacki Weaver seems to  have not much to say in this movie she just kinda stands around with a look of constant turmoil and confusion on her face.  During Pats jog, this is where he runs constantly into Tiffany who jogs with him. They first  meet and show no interested at first..  As they get to know each other, Tiffany  woos him in by asking him to be enter a dance contest with her, in return, she will get a letter to his ex wife with out he courts knowing about it. Things start to take a turn from there on in,  DeNiro starts believing in his son recovery and puts his money where his mouth is and bets on the football game. Tiffany starts believing in Pat's recovery and put her heart where her mouth it and enters them both in  a dancing contest. Jackie Weaver, well, Im not sure what she belived in, but I believe she was Sally Struthers in a past life.

This movie was weak in many areas, but what I did like about it was the fact that it attempted to show how  many dysfunctional family there really are in this world. Sometimes life doesn't always have touch downs. We fumble, tackle each other, call time outs and on a good day, huddle around each other, but at the end of the day we are all on the same team.",1361491200,10,3478,4.269525267993874
5175783,4,B008OGIPJA,"If you are a fan of something different that's not just a Hollywood type story than you will enjoy this.  It reminds me of a Bad Santa type of raw movie.  De Niro, Cooper, and Lawrence play such flawed characters and I find these movies refreshing.  You don't get to see movies like that everyday so I enjoy them.  I wouldn't call it a laugh out loud comedy, but there is a few funny scenes.  Most of it has to do with how out of touch these people are with their issues.",1361404800,,471,4.076086956521739
5175784,4,B008OGIPJA,"Working in a movie theater myself, I have seen this movie 7 times in its entirety and i am prod to say this movie is worth a full purchase, not just a rental. Now i'm not a fan of the genre of this movie which is more love than comedy yet i guess you could state it as a love comedy. Infact i did not enjoy it until my third time watching it, then i continually enjoyed it the next four times. I have seen plenty of people watch this movie and come back days later with all their friends, male or female its a great movie mostly due to Bradly Cooper's and Jennifer Lawrence's skill as actors respectively.

I won't get into the plot as i'm sure other reviews have already, but now that i think of it I must add that this movie shows that a basic plot can become a classic with the correct execution. Football and love are the two biggest themes in the story, a smart move to connect with men and women alike. Add the complex Pat and Tiffany's characters past, mental issues, and family to get believable characters that you honestly care about. Not to mention supporting characters role's such as Pat's father played by Robert De Nero. I cant tress enough that the actors are what brings this movie to life. Even with the characters past's and relationships to one another its the actors that bring it to life.

Now all movies have a downside, but the good news is this movie has little other than opinions. Such has heavily language and some unnecessary background story, i found that Tiffany getting fired for having sex with all her coworkers is a little far fetched (that's not a spoiler, so it won't mess up much of the story if you did not get the chance to see it in theater). Other than that its basic plot is kinda disappointing to me, but i'm the guy who requires incredible plots like Les Miserable, another great movie if you get the chance to see. Other than that i cant critique it.

This really is a great movie that will appeal to adults of both sex, but not a very good movie for kids they will learn a few new words from it far better than public school could. Great acting and complex characters save this movie from any kind of complaints you could think of. I will be happy to go back to work and see it for an eight time. Again this is great movie and defiantly worth $20. Anything over that i would not pay, blu ray would be nice, but the movie already has great sound and picture quality. My apologies for not mentioning that earlier. This movie defiantly has a chance of becoming a classic 100 or more years later after we are all gone. On on final note the directing was fa nominal. Overall a great movie and one that should not be missed. 4 stars.",1361404800,,2674,4.280632411067193

5175786,1,B008OGIPJA,"I just saw this in a theater that had about 50 folks in it - and for an alleged romantic comedy, it elicited only about three chuckles and one half cough/half chuckle.

Why all the Oscar buzz? The movie is completely unbelievable, thoroughly self-conscious, insidiously manipulative, not funny, not romantic and the plot is as predictable as knowing who won this year's Super Bowl. Even the filming is utterly predictable: swirling cameras around happy couples, zooms in and out not where we'd least expect them - but where we have seen them a zillion times before.  And why is the acting being hosannaed to the heavens?  Bradley Cooper has no charisma whatsoever.  Jennifer Lawrence is bad girl boring.  Robert De Niro has been playing this exact same part forever and physically looks to be morphing into Tony Bennett.  And De Niro's wife - well, I thought it was Sally Struthers post-diet making a comeback - but it wasn't her - but whomever it was, all the actress did was stand around looking pole-axed.

The way the makers of this movie try to push buttons is also both insulting and embarrassing. Characters of a distinctly politically correct nature make token appearances throughout - and what happened to the issue of bipolar disorder?  The film starts off as though it will be a rather serious study of the disorder with some comic overtones to lighten the intense issue a bit in order to make it more palatable for popular consumption - and then loses that theme a third of the way in and devolves into a trite and banal and, again, incredibly predictable love story.  One other recurring annoyance that threads through the whole affair - the characters don't really talk to or with one another.  They soliloquize.  They talk a tremendous lot, each making their script-heavy speeches - and that gets boring fast.  Some scenes seemed like they would never end.

A last thing about this movie: Each time the main character took to jogging he would be wearing a garbage bag.  By the third or fourth time of seeing this I was so disgusted with the movie that I would have just loved to put the entire film into one big heavy-duty garbage bag!

As for Oscar?  Well, Oscar has been pretty dumb down the years actually.  Most picks are not based on quality but on coffer control.  Many of the greatest movies ever made and the greatest performances have hardly been glanced upon by dear dumb Oscar.  One example:  how could Frankie Fane have lost an Academy Award for Best Actor to Frank Sinatra????  Oh, the tragedies of tinseltown!",1361145600,31,2538,4.722727272727273
5175787,4,B008OGIPJA,"Pat (Bradley Cooper) has just left a state mental institution, eight months after having caught his wife having an affair with a colleague, and almost beating the colleague to death.  He moves back in with his parents, a devoted and long-suffering mother and a father who's a violent football fan.  Pat's determined to win back his wife, and to do so enlists Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young depressed woman who's just lost her husband in a car accident.  In return, Tiffany asks Pat to be her dance partner.

While Pat and Tiffany definitely have issues, it's this movie that's truly schizophrenic.

First, I have questions about the casting.  Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence come across as too stupid and boring to actually have mental issues (the idea that Cooper is an undiagnosed bi-polar is just laughable).  Either a Ben Stiller type or an Owen Wilson type (vulnerable but lovable) would have made much more sense.  And there's an endless list of Hollywood leading ladies who could easily come across as mentally deranged, but Jennifer Lawrence just isn't one of them.  There's just too much force, willpower, and assertiveness to believe that Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany is vulnerable and depressed.

Second, the plot is incoherent, manipulative, and opportunistic.  Because this is a romantic comedy, we already know how the movie's going to end, and the movie doesn't need to add so many redundant subplots.  A lot of the turns and twists don't really make much sense either.

Third, there's just too much screaming and shouting in the film.  People with mental issues don't necessarily just scream and shout at each other in public all the time -- often, the expression of mental exhaustion and stress is soft and quiet, and thus the more twisted and violent.  As it stands, Pat and Tiffany seem less like troubled individuals, and more like hormonal teenagers.

But despite these flaws the movie does work, and it works in large part because of these flaws.  The flaws create so much uneasy tension that a resolution -- any stupid resolution, really -- is a relief.  As a form of shallow entertainment, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" does work -- but anything more and it simply falls apart.",1361059200,3,2222,4.975609756097561

A couple who magically make a whole, and who are now (drum roll please) mentally healthy, ready to face the world together!  Such a stupid premise.  Really stupid. After viewing Silver Linings Playbook, why wouldn't  shrinks all across America start thinking, ""Hey, I think my 9 o'clock and my 10 o'clock would make a great couple!!! Say, how about my 3 o'clock and my 4 o'clock???"" It's nominated for so many categories for the Oscars, (even Best Picture if you can believe it), we're going to be inundated with clips from this wretched movie for the whole night.  I love love love the Oscars, but this year I am going to drive to Niagara Falls, go to my favorite casino and play the slots all night and forget the Oscars are being televised.  And as for the reviewers who called Pat and Tiffany quirky?  Oh my.  If only mental illness was simply an issue of just being quirky.  My suggestion: Avoid this dreck at all costs. Instead, rent Joe Wright's brilliant and sumptuous Anna Karenina or sit by the fire and read a good book. Let's face it. It's the middle of winter and we're all going a little stir crazy.

The fawning of critics and the accompanying cavalcade of Oscar nominations set the bar high for seeing this movie near the end of its in-theater run. Then, as the credits rolled, I felt cheated. This is not a bad movie, but it's a movie that fell surprisingly short of the high expectations that come with critical acclaim and multi-category Oscar buzz. The crusty presence of Robert Di Niro and an intricately woven thread of football fandom don't fully conceal the chick flick at the gooey center of this movie.

The comedy part of this ""romcom"" genre is adult, dark, farcical and football-centered enough to allow males to retain their man card if they watch this on anything other than a first date. But fellas, you have been warned (and this is in no way a spoiler): never forget the outcome of the movie hinges on the outcome of a ballroom dance contest. We've been here before so many times. ""Flashdance"" and ""Dirty Dancing"" are calling, and they want their endings back.

As for all of the chatter about honest views of mental health problems: the mental health discussion is as superficial as the paen to NFL football fandom. This glossing over leaves us with something a little more gritty than most of its categorical kin. What remains is a movie about the under-appreciated underdog entrants in a dance contest.

Not glossed over is in-your-face product placement. Post Raisin Bran (who knew cereal was a relationship signpost?), Apple hardware (so what's new?) and Seroquel (possibly a big screen first for a powerful anti-psychotic medication) get almost as much screen time as Di Niro. In the words of Liz Lemon: what the what?

Good enough to pay full price at the theater? Yes.
Worth paying for a streaming view or DVD rental? Yes.
Oscar worthy? As Di Niro himself may have said in another role: ""fugget about it"".",1360195200,,2091,4.84593837535014
5175793,5,B008OGIPJA,"This is why we go to movies. Silver Linings Playbook is that rare breed of movie where all the moving parts got put together in exactly the right way. The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy.  The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.

Pat is an underachieving substitute high school history teacher who has just been released from the Karel Psychiatric Facility after spending an eight month court-ordered stint for nearly beating the history teacher to death when he finds him in the shower with his wife. His doting, eternally optimistic mother brings him home hoping that the worst of his previously undiagnosed bipolar symptoms are under control. But his refusal to take his meds and an unfortunate incident concerning Earnest Hemingway and a window quickly dispels that optimism. Pat is in fact clueless, living inside a self-delusion bubble in which he reunites with the truly unattainable object of his obsession, his wife Nikki.  Two more mismatched souls the world has never seen but he is the only one who doesn't realize it. He plods doggedly on in pursuit, oblivious to everything and everyone else around him.  His illness has removed the normal barriers that prevent him from expressing the unfiltered truth as he sees it, making for some awkward, cringe-worthy, often humorous exchanges. Pat is hardly ready for the real world.

And he certainly is not ready for Tiffany. Pat's best friend invites him over for a homecoming dinner which turns out to be a blind date with his wife's recently widowed sister, Tiffany.  Tiffany suffers from severe depression and her mood swings run the gamut - volatile, bitter, vulnerable, stubborn, sexy, and sweet - all thrown randomly into a mixer and blended at high speed. Everyone is a little afraid of her. Her depression results from her guilt over her husband's death which she attributes to her loss of sexual interest in him. She sleeps with everyone in her office in an attempt to anesthetize herself from her emotional pain. She is dead inside, just breathing air. And into this web steps the unsuspecting Pat.

From the moment they meet sparks and barbs fly indiscriminately between them, much to the horror of their hosts who believe they are witnessing a train wreck in the making. But these two lost and damaged souls immediately connect, kindred spirits seeking respite from the storm. Pat is overwhelmed, unable to come to grips with guilt over the intensity of his attraction to Tiffany and the incident sends him into an uncontrolled manic episode. Tiffany feels the same connection and it jolts her far enough out of her stupor for her to see the possibilities. When Pat turns down her offer to sleep with her the flame sparks higher, her curiosity is piqued, and her pursuit begins in earnest.  As she starts to nurture and guide Pat, she develops such a flaming torch for him that it would blister the skin off any ordinary guy.  But he is oblivious, content just to follow her around like the lost puppy he is. She grabs the opportunity full throttle, dragging the perplexed, not-quite-ready-for-reality Pat along for the ride.

The cast is simply brilliant. Bradley Cooper is a revelation as the bipolar misfit whose philosophy consists of working hard and staying positive to find the silver lining in everything. He and Jennifer Lawrence have such electrifying chemistry together that you find yourself rooting for them to find a way to be together from the moment they meet. Robert DeNiro comes alive in his Oscar-nominated role as Pat's Eagles-obsessed, superstitious, OCD bookie father. Chris Tucker deserves special mention as Pat's equally optimistic fellow psychiatric inmate and friend Danny (""Black it up Pat!"").

But make no doubt about it - this is Jennifer Lawrence's movie. At twenty two she is the real thing. Her performance here is transcendental. Even with the marvelous supporting cast holding the bar so high the movie would not work without her. She is visceral - caustic and vulnerable in the same breath. Her facial expressions hide nothing - she is fearless, willing to expose Tiffany's raw emotional core to everyone around her, warts and all as she juggles staying one step ahead of both Pats obsession as well as her own.  The transformational changes that occur are put into motion and propelled forward by her. She bets everything with no guarantee that he is capable of giving her what she so desperately needs, willing to run the risk of diving off the emotional cliff for a chance at the real thing. Her character is the lynchpin of the story. And Jennifer Lawrence is nowhere to be found here. The success of the movie rides on her shoulders and she is brilliantly up to the task. Her talent is embarrassing.

The film is unapologetically romantic but dismissing it as a simple romance is missing the point. It deals with family, friendship, truth, sacrifice, and love as imperfect ideals worth fighting for regardless of your place in the world.  It is a brave film. Do yourself a favor, go see it. It is ultimately a joyous affirmation of life's possibilities. And who doesn't need a little of that?",1360108800,560,5315,4.904231625835189
5175794,4,B008OGIPJA,"If you want to get rock hard abs from laughing, fall in love with endearing characters with personality disorders, and learn how to salvage your sanity all at the same time, Silver Linings Playbook will give you the game plan you need. This unconventionally charming comedy is clever and shocking. The characters are as lovable as they are deranged, and the overall message is sweet.

Pat Solatono (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything after a bipolar breakdown sent him to a mental institution for eight months. Once he gets out, he clings to positivity, determined to rebuild his life and salvage his marriage despite a restraining order. He moves back in with his concerned but loving parents. His father (Robert DeNiro) wants to use his obsession with Philadelphia Eagles football to reconnect with his son, while his mother (Jacki Weaver) wants to use her Sunday football snacks to fix the situation.

When Pat meats Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a hot mess herself, she throws Pat onto a different route to recovery. When she offers to help him contact his wife in exchange for helping her on a special project, silver linings show up in both of their lives.

I'm not knowledgeable about personality disorders myself, so I would be easily fooled if Bradley Cooper's performance was subpar, but Cooper apparently immersed himself in a ton of research to accurately portray his role as a man fighting his bipolar disorder. He was quick and witty and his character was as unfiltered as tapwater. His research paid off as his portrayal of Pat was seamless.

Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect misfit by his side. She dominates every scene is was in. Her scathing humor was powerful and believable. But at the same time, she allows the audience to catch glimpses of her sweet and tender disposition that underlies her harsh exterior. She adds playful dynamics to their relationship because while Pat is concerned with rebuilding and bettering himself, Tiffany has accepted and embraced all her flaws and shortcomings.

The greatest thing about this film was how it created humor from circumstances that would be irredeemably dysfunctional in the real world. That breed of humor straddles a feeble line between being hilarious and being offensive. Silver Linings Playbook nailed it. I laughed at scenes that would have caused crocodile tears in other movies. The humor would have been delightful on its own, but to make it especially brilliant, it's symbolic. For every scene of panic attacks, physical altercations, and verbal abuse, there was humor- a silver lining.

I left the theatre feeling a little bit insane, only because I felt so sane. I feel like the next time I'm crippled by real pain, I will be able to find something beautiful about it. Maybe we could all use a few weeks in an asylum. Maybe the people there know something we don't know. Maybe they're better at seeing silver linings.",1360108800,3,2898,4.9649484536082475
5175795,3,B008OGIPJA,"I find Silver Linings Playbook unbelievable, shallow, and spurious.

The plot seems to be interesting, but far fetched details, scenes, and dialogue spoil the movie.

The main character with bipolar disorder leaves a mental hospital, gets back home, and starts looking for his wife who betrayed him with a school teacher. The guy's family and friends try to prevent them from the meeting. But he loves his wife and wants to get her back. (His main problem is not his illness, but that he struggles to hold for his past love). Then he meets a girl who has mental problems too. For no reason she falls in love with him and tries to do everything to keep him. Looks like it's a great chance for the guy to get rid of his ""ghost"", start his life anew and have a new love, but he is still holding for his past love, his wife. He shows no interest in the ""crazy girl"". The crazy girl is trying to teach him dancing and reveal some the difference between them and normal people, so at the end when he meets his wife, he decides to let her go. He is not cured, but he accepts his new love and new life.

The acting was good, not great, especially for DeNiro, but okay for a 3rd grade film. Story? I do not buy it. It looks like some ""sane"", smart people wrote a script about ""insane"" people to make big bucks on the topic and maybe get an Oscar. I do not mind main characters with mental problems, but why do the authors push forward the idea that mentally disable people are more frank, sincere, and ""real"" than normal? Isn't it a stereotype? They show his friends and even elder brother as jerks who did not care about him while he was in the hospital. But he has a big heart and loves everyone anyway. It's okay, but why such a bias? So that the audience to love the character and feel sorry for him and at the same time - feel guilty for their own inattentiveness? The trick it too cheap. Some details and dialogues sound fake too, it's a pure fantasy of the authors who tried to imagine how mentally disable people can speak and what they can discuss. He asks her if she slept with a woman, and voila, she did. And she even sat on the woman's laps. What a coincidence! And it's not the only one. The Philadelphia Eagles win every time when the characters are together... What a sign!

At the end the authors tried to repeat the success of Little Miss Sunshine, including one of the messages: ""They lost, but they won."" Come on, be more original. I have seen it before. If you want to copy, make your copy better than original. Make catharsis more powerful, real, without fake tears of joy.

Gimmicks, cheap tricks, and cheap laughs make the movie far fetched, unbelievable, and shallow. It struggles to pretend to be funny, meaningful, heartfelt, and touching, but tries too hard, so ends up to be predictable, boring, and fake. It's an imitation, gilded, not gold.

Many movies that I've seen at the theaters aren't worth of seeing more than once, not even mentioning of having them at home. This movie is a rare exception. In my opinion, it's a very touchy and romantic movie. I loved the actors' play and how the storyline was developing, especially how the response letter played out (don't wanna say the details in order not to ruin readers' expectations). Despite the fact that the book has a different ending (according to at least 1 review here), I loved how the movie ended; I think that considering everything that happened before the dance, it had to be the dance that actually brought them together. Both Lawrence and Cooper were amazing in the movie. Besides that, the movie opened up a new movie star to me because I've never heard of Jennifer Lawrence before.

5175797,5,B008OGIPJA,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a romantic comedy-drama genre film. The narrative delves into mental breakdown and the process of recovery which is carried out somewhat paradoxically with conventional and non-conventional methods.

The story begins with the glumness of institutional care and lead character Pat Solitano Jr. receiving a hospital discharge to the supervision of his parents.

It is the return to familiar and unresolved issues which is the foundation of events and Pat is eager to make good of the past to truly recover, but in the process he hits many walls.

His development comes through an inadvertent commitment to bereaved Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) and a challenge to enter a dance competition, which is complemented by his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed family and their well-intended support of him. Pat Sr. is played with sharp authenticity by Robert De Niro and his wife Dolores (Aussie Jacki Weaver) is the warmhearted caregiver who somehow knows how to keep the rabble in reasonable order.

The film contains a unique balance with self-provoked anxiety causing Pat collapses, his actions and those who care for him a source of raucous humour and the realisation love can be lost and found, which all combines to present a well-paced, tightly constructed and highly entertaining movie.

I left the theater wanting to see what happens next in each of their lives. Even though I laughed out loud several times, I felt it was a serious comedy that truly pulled at your heart strings.

He goes into a berserk mode whenever he hears ""My Cherie Amour"" like Curly used to do when they played ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Of course bipolar people should be introduced to other bipolar people, because you never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.

Patrick is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who steals every scene with an Oscar worthy performance. Robert De Niro plays Patrick's father, a superstitious Eagles fan, who appears to be slightly bipolar himself. While institutionalized, Patrick learned to look for ""the silver lining"" in everything in order to cope with life, something he doesn't always do too well. Tiffany has her own issues and together they haphazardly work their way into a relationship.

They should film more movies in Philadelphia as I have never seen the streets so clean. It is a heart warming, fun drama/romance with an indie flavor. Worth a view, but not necessarily on the big screen.

5175801,4,B008OGIPJA,"If, while watching ""Silver Linings Playbook"", you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart.  If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.

For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi-polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large.  This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle.  It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.

At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life.  If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level.  Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high.  The moral of the story is that we are all a little ""screwed up"" on some level, but we just need to find that ""silver lining"" to get through life.  Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.

Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads.  Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.

Overall, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic.  It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.",1359244800,4,2035,4.650837988826815

I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other ""moral"" life choices, thought the entire film depended on ""cute"" writing and cliche (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes.

5175805,5,B008OGIPJA,"It seems that often when we go to the movies we are expecting something. Sometimes maybe our expectations are too high, but each film strives to send some kind of a message. Too often films will fail in their attempt; these are not always bad films. I would argue that sometimes really good films fall a little short. Nevertheless we will go to the movies expecting to have an enjoyable time. A film does not always have to be great to have an enjoyable time. But when the credits role and the film has played our hope is that we got something out of it. I myself always want to have some kind of takeaway.  If I don't have a takeaway I believe that film was a failure regardless if it was well-written or well-acted. A film I just watched has everything I look for in a film, and that film is Silver Linings Playbook.

Silver Linings Playbook is a rare kind of film. Some may ask why I feel this way, well sit back and I will tell you. I don't always like films that are about life in general because too often they do not portray anything I have seen about life and where life takes you. However, to me Silver Linings Playbook has a true ring to it. I am really noting like either of the main characters as I am neither bipolar or a 20 year old widow. But I am someone with a lot of life experience and the message in the film is clear. Too often we hang on to the things that have broken our hearts. Broken hearts are really part of life, everyone will experience heartbreak in their lifetime there is no way around it. My experience with heartbreak would usually come if I felt something was missing. When that something is missing we strive to do every thing in our power to get it back. But I remember something I heard in a Best Picture winning film just a few years ago. By the time we get done chasing what is gone there is more going out the door. Sometimes the thing we are looking for is standing before our very eyes and we refuse to see it because a broken heart makes you blind in many ways.

I don't want anyone to be discouraged by what I am saying and think this is just another sad cry your eyes out film. It is not one of those films at all, I will be honest I laughed more than anything else. It is a film where you can laugh, cry, and even be inspired. There is a reason for the first time in 31 years this film is nominated for every acting category at the Academy Awards. It is a wonderful film, and don't just take my word for it.

5175806,4,B008OGIPJA,"All the hype about Jennifer Lawrence makes me want to run screaming from her, but I have to admit she did okay in ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" a film about crazy people who fall in love in the way only Hollywood can imagine.  Her co-star, Bradley Cooper, is as good, despite being burdened with looking like what you'd get if Sean Penn and Woody Woodpecker had a baby.  I also kept thinking he was that guy from ""The Walking Dead.""  Or one of those two guys on that cable show about doctors who are brothers or whatever.  Lawrence and Cooper are both neurotically charming, more or less in the same way Jack Nicholson was neurotically charming in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""As Good As It Gets."" Robert DeNiro turns in his best performance in a decade as Pat's OCD father, and though she doesn't have much to do except look pensive and make snacks, Jacki Weaver is fun as the befuddled mom, a post-modern version of all those doddering matriarchs that populated 1960s TV.  It's a compliment to her presence as an actress because her character gets almost no development.

By now, many of us know that when it comes to the Oscar, actors who get to play mentally disturbed or challenged characters start salivating because they know the Academy is hot and heavy for it. I'm not sure they ever get the whole mental illness thing right -- I once dated a bi-polar woman who resembled and whose behavior was a lot like Lawrence's Tiffany, even though according to the film, it's Cooper's Pat that is the one who is bi-polar and not her. He seemed to suffer from delusions closer to schizophrenia and some amalgam of OCD and Tourette's, but what do I know?  The movie has an Indie feel to it, though not always consistently. While David O. Russell is no David Lean, his direction is by and large capable, and he gives working-class Philly the right blend of hominess and kitsch to be authentic.

If there is a major weakness to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" aside from its predictable but, of course, tiresome reliance on black and Asian stereotypes, it's a story that isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  The first half of the film functions reasonably well as a dark dramedy, but it turns rom-com soon after.  It works more or less because by then you'll like the characters, but the movie has the feel of having been forced to switch tracks to a standard Hollywood ending.  Not having read the book, I'm not sure if this is a flaw from the writer or from a film project that seems designed by committee, which usually results in the duck-billed playtpus version of art.

The story at first wants to comment on the its-so-bad-you-just-gotta-laugh-at-it nature of dealing with mental illness, as Pat struggles after his release from a mental hospital to put his life back together, fixated most on winning back his wife.  There's genuine tension when he meets Tiffany, a nymphomaniac who you'd expect would be just as satisfied cutting herself as she is sleeping with everyone in the office.  You want the couple to fall in love because at heart they're good people, but at the same time, you understand that given the parameters of the story, that's unwise.  Of course, those parameters change, and when they do, the film loses its edge, culminating in an ending that rather than celebrates the fragile, hard-fought gains against mental illness so severe it must be medicated, embraces those illnesses instead.  By this time, you'll have forgotten that they have any real problems in this regard at all -- you'll get what I mean when you think about the resolution for the DeNiro character in particular.  While satisfying as a rom-com ending, it subverts what the other half of the movie seemed to be wanting to say.  People will tell me I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be a feel-good movie, I'm sure, but shouldn't we expect more from an Oscar-nominated film?

Back to Lawrence:  She has that odd combination of a lanky runner's body and a face still pudgy with baby fat, giving her a look that's not quite girl-next-door but not extraordinary either.  She is this era's Julia Roberts because of it, a woman who isn't so stunning that she alienates other women but at the same time is attractive enough that we're drawn to her.  Though the effort Hollywood is making to turn her into a star is nauseating, she does have potential, if mostly to maintain the status quo in an age where maybe the entertainment industry could be diversifying a little bit more.  If it feels like she's the flavor of the month, it's because she is, but she does not have to be.",1358899200,3,4567,4.645962732919255
5175807,3,B008OGIPJA,"I guess I was one of the few who was underwhelmed by this film.  Not that I didn't find the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence enjoyable to watch.  They both breathed a lot of vitality into their roles, especially in the penultimate dance scene which was great fun.  Unfortunately, the film floundered when dear Dad's bookmaking figured into the plot, dragging this movie down into an all too predictable set of events.

I would have thought more critics would have responded to the sloppy writing, but it seems they too were swept away by the bravura performances and gave David O. Russell a pass on his ""playbook.""  All his movies have clunked in my opinion, largely because they flirt too much with disaster, resting heavily on engaging ideas and not enough on script.  Beyond a few great early scenes like that when Pat takes exception to how Hemingway chose to end Farewell to Arms, there was little to remember in the way of clever dialog. What you do remember is the passion that played out between Pat and Tiffany, largely thanks to their great physical performances.  They needed no words when it came to dancing, or running for that matter.  Their expressions said it all.

Chris Tucker similarly made scenes funny not by what he said, but how he said it.  Unfortunately, he was little more than a comic foil whenever Russell reached a dramatic dead end.  As for De Niro, we have seen him play this role one too many times.  This time the overly obsessed Dad takes football too seriously.  Jacki Weaver makes for an engaging Mom, but her role is limited, mostly because she never seems to know what to say.  Put some words in her mouth, David!

Whatever transpired between he and Nikki was left to a whisper.  I guess Russell didn't want to deal with such ornery matters, preferring to end it on the dance floor with a leggy Jennifer Lawrence leaving no doubt in any viewer's mind that she was the one.

For all the raves, I expected much more.  Instead, it was the fluff I've come to expect from Russell, a director who still doesn't seem to have conquered adolescence.

The protagonist is Pat. He's a former high school history teacher and coach (as well as a bipolar disorder sufferer) who went a bit crazy after ""something"" went wrong with his marriage. That something landed him in a mental hospital as part of a plea bargain. We meet him the day his doting and loving mother gets him discharged from the facility. Pat is touchingly and sometimes even maddeningly naive about the chances of renewing his marriage with his wife Nikki. Like many people (including me), he's been conditioned by Hollywood and popular culture to expect a happy ending to the ""movie"" his life seems to be to him.

But Pat should have remembered that sometimes the happy ending that you think you want is not the ending you are going to get and the one you get is much better than the one you want. The ""twist"" in his life-movie plot comes in the form of a young widow named Tiffany who is struggling to overcome her own personal demons. Somehow, grudgingly, Pat becomes friends with her and then something more along the way...I won't say more than that, except to say the story has an immensely uplifting ending that put a smile on my face.

This odd love story unfolds in Philadelphia and against the backdrop of the NFL season. Pat, like his brother and father, is a rabid Eagles fan and a great deal of the story delves in what that means to love a team so much. Suffice to say that even though I'm from Washington DC (go Redskins!) it made me want to go see the Eagles play and root for them to be part of the Eagles fandom brotherhood for just a moment (so long as it wasn't a game with the Redskins).

There are three things about this story that stand out to me as being particularly praise-worthy.

1.  Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely luminous as Tiffany.  She may have been a bit young to play the role of someone who was in their mid-to-late 20s, but she was so beautiful, sad, and compelling, I was more than willing to suspend disbelief on that part (and besides some people do look much younger than their actual ages...and a thirty-five year old being involved with a 21 year old may be uncommon but it's hardly deviant).

2. Dr. ""Cliff"" Patel (Pat's therapist) is a great supporting character...especially when he reveals that he too is an ardent Eagles fan.

3. The depiction of serious mental illness like that Pat suffers (and to a lesser extent Tiffany) is not sugar-coated but not portrayed in an ugly way that might repel the viewer. The scene where Pat has a major episode and winds up scuffling with his parents is well done and heart-breaking.

So how did the movie and novel differ from each other?

<spoilers>

I think most of the changes were driven by the need to keep the story moving along and prevent the movie from getting too long.  I only think the ones that made the movie a little less compelling than the book were items 1, 2, 3, and 4 below.

1.  The movie ended with the Tiffany and Pat professing their love for each other at the end of the dance competition, instead of lying down on a snowy field to watch for clouds and saying that they needed each other (vice ""loved"").  I actually liked the book ending better, but I suppose the movie had a more Hollywood ending simply because Hollywood knows what sells.

2.  Nikki did not come to the dance recital in the book, but Pat did have his brother drive him past the house where she was living with her new husband and family and seeing them happy, Pat realized his marriage was truly over and that he didn't want to bother or bother with Nikki anymore.  I think that would have made a better resolution than what the movie did.

3.  Pat's family was not Italian-American in the book.  I didn't mind this change, but I wished that they had played down the ""lovable noisy Italian American family"" cliche some.  All the people yelling at each other got slightly annoying.

4.  Pat exchanged more letters with what he thought was his wife Nikki in the book and contrary to the movie, he did not find out that the letters were fake until Tiffany told him they were.  These letters and the ones Tiffany wrote him under her own name shed a lot of useful light on Tiffany and how she felt about Pat.

5.  Pat and Tiffany did not go to the beach with their friends in the movie.

6.  Pat's father in the book did not have his own problems with low level OCD but was simply somewhat withdrawn from his family although he did love Pat and his wife.

7.  The Eagles games featured more prominently in the book.

8.  Pat's father was not a bookie in the book and did not make any bets about the outcome of the game with the Cowboys or the dance competition with his friend.

9.  The dance that Pat and Tiffany did in the book was more a modern dance than ballroom, and they did better in the book than the movie.

10.  The scene in the book where Pat got in a fight at an Eagles game was somewhat different than what the movie showed.  Pat did not get arrested.

11.  Pat did not get mugged and his leg broken in the movie like he did in the book.

12.  They used different songs in the movie and book as the song from Pat and Nikki's wedding that was playing when he caught his wife cheating on him.

13.  Pat's mother did not go ""on strike"" to try to change Pat's father's behavior in the movie like she did in the book.

14.  Unlike in the book, Pat did not blot out the reason why he wound up in a mental hospital in the movie.

15.  Pat was in the mental hospital for four years in the book and was hazy about how long he had been there (somewhat deliberately).  In the movie, he had been away for eight months and knew that.

16.  While the movie showed Pat as working hard to lose weight and get in great shape for the sake his hoped for reunion with Nikki, it was not done to quite the same degree as in the book.

<end spoilers>

So I would say see the movie and read the book...both are worthwhile, but it's the book that will stay with me more.

Finally, those who like this book/movie probably will like ""Ordinary People,"" another story that also deals with family tragedy and mental illness but is similarly uplifting with some romantic elements.

5175809,4,B008OGIPJA,"David O. Russell brings a deeply human dimension to this odd tale of two souls desperately living on the fringes. The tale centers on Pat's (Bradley Cooper) determination to reconcile with his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), despite the impossibility of that ideal and the valiant effort. As Pat goes through an exhausting course of attempting to salvage the last remnants of his failed marriage he is not always ""present"" in the moment, to notice the virtues of the people around him trying in vain to keep up with his highs and lows. This is especially noticeable when Pat chooses to open up to an unexpected friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who is also impossible to keep up with, and hardly notices her love and concern during his obsessive search for reconciliation with his wife.

Even if the lives of Pat and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are in a tail-spin when we are introduced to them, their meeting becomes a promising occasion for allaying the chaos in their lives. But in an impulsive moment (or is it cold, and calculated) a quid pro quo deal is struck between them that promises to unhinge, rather than sustain, harmony in their lives. We  see the makings of a tragedy of two doomed people attracted to each other for all the wrong reasons. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" begins with these premonitions of high tragedy.

But it is surprising, even magical, when the movie becomes a beautiful, even consoling, illustration of a tale of hopelessness with a ""silver lining"". The story portends tragedy and chaos but there is also transcendence, this powerful will in the two central characters to overcome failure, misunderstandings, and impossible losses. The real power of the film was its success in conveying the experience of sheer exhileration that accompanies those moments of insight in the lives of Tiffany and Pat as they struggle to transcend their circumstances with relentless optimism.

The emotional richness of the story has everything to do with the strange world of Tiffany and Pat. The freshness of the story unsettles all expectations. These off-beat characters have their kin in Hollywood history, from Frank Mackey in Anderson's Magnolia, to Ricky Fitts and Angela Hayes in Mendes's American Beauty. The pitch of the emotional drama of some of the scenes in Russell's film reminded me of the greatest scenes in the most trenchant melodramas made in the last couple of decades. The expressiveness of Pat and Tiffany together has an edginess to it that is a reminder of those brilliant scenes between Fitts and Hayes in the landmark Sam Mendes film. David O. Russell, an impressive director when he is at his best (See his Three Kings for instance) has the deft hand to transform the element of grotesque in the tale into a deeply human one.

This movie embraces and shirks realism. Wounded characters miraculously transcend their circumstances. We are not quite sure where the psychological realism ends and the surreal begins. We are immersed in the psychological mayhem of the life of Tiffany and Pat one minute, and the next minute they are singing praises of each other. The film manages to put a perspective to the surfeit of realism as it hangs over the veil of romantic fantasy to keep the psychological chaos of these characters at just that right remove. The film suspends the unsettling reality of these lost lives at just that right ""cinematic"" distance to keep our attention on what is a genuinely moving human drama developing around the tumultuous ups and downs of  two young lives.

Inspired acting from two eminently watchable actors in Hollywood: Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper breathes much of the life into this film. The charisma of these stars make their characters watchable. Both of them succeed early and well in bringing a sympathetic dimension to their wayward characters. Cooper and Lawrence are the backbone of the story until the last energetic frame of the film, even if Robert DeNiro as Pat's obsessive compulsive father and the poignant  and long suffering presence of Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother, tempers and renders meaning to a story that threatens to become one full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

The scene with Pat reading, or devouring, Hemingway with intense interest is at once touching and comic. When Pat, in one of his many bouts of frenzy, retreats into this book he is deflated to find Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms end on a tragic note. In stinging protest he admonishes Hemingway's masochistic  streak. Pat is livid about the novel's unnecessary tragic ending. He flings out that book through the window of his attic rejecting the tragic sense of life in that novel. This form of art does the disservice of mindlessly courting the sad endings he is come to experience in life. This scene alerts the audience that the director may be setting us up for an ending that is a subversion of the tragic ending. The meaning of the title of the movie is for the first time brought up memorably.

But a counter-argument is soon set up to Pat's critique of the novel. The tragic wisdom set up by Hemingway has an admirer. Pat's view of art is expanded as that counter-argument comes in the form of a letter from an admirer. It is worth seeing this film to find out who this admirer is and what the source of that tragic wisdom is. It will serve to illustrate how a ""silver lining"" plays out in Pat and Tiffany's increasingly convoluted and dangerous playbook of life.

David O. Russell resurrects the poetics of loss in ""Silver Linings Playbook"", which is a much needed reprisal of themes that were the subject of  P.T. Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Paul Haggis's Crash (2005), and Alejandro Inarittu's 21 Grams. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film that subverts the ending of these notable recent tragedies on film with a brilliant twist. Where Innaritu and Anderson leave their endings hauntingly open Russell will bend his ending to the reconciliatory themes addressed by the protagonist's ruminations on the tragic sense in the great American novel.",1358812800,4,6046,4.927308447937132

5175813,5,B008OGIPJA,"The question of mental illness in Silver Linings Playbook: For me, the mental illness worked (and was not exploitative) because it was the kind of mental illness that we all suffer from to some degree (a desire for perfection in love and in life). And for all of us part of growing up is figuring out how to deal with this lack of perfection, this fact that life will never be or feel perfect. (So throwing the Hemingway novel out the window was awesome, a way of recognizing that even in art life is not perfect----Melville has a line ""the truth comes in with darkness""). For me, the Bradley Cooper character just suffers from an extreme version of this shared human malady. And so we all kind of recognize ourselves in that character. So for me this particular mental illness (theatrical as it is) is a convenient way to visualize a common human failing. And to outwardly reveal just how destructive unrealistic expectations/unrealized dreams can be (those things we usually keep hidden away). The director is dealing with pretty dark and disappointing truths here but in a way that allows us to both connect to Bradley and let go of our own unrealistic expectations (or whatever it is that is spoiling life for us) as he does. And the comedy is part of that healing. (The other great scene in the movie is the crotch face plant---an example of something going wrong but this time being perceived as being kind of perfect anyway. ""Yeah we got a 5"").So many Hollywood movies are about chasing larger than life dreams but this film is a nice earthy corrective to that blatant disregard for realism and how real people really cope.",1358553600,2,1630,4.663194444444445
5175814,5,B008OGIPJA,"If anyone has been dismissing Cooper as just a good looking empty headed guy, he dispels that image with this film.  He is onscreen virtually all of the time and gives a very nuanced performance, holding his own very well against his major foil in the film, his father played by Robert DeNiro. Although on one level it might seem that Cooper has other foils, the mental illness problems which the two of them exhibit show that both of them mainly battle with mental illness in both its nature and nurture modes. We have many people in my extended family with various forms of mental illness, going back for many generations, so I really could relate to this aspect of this film. The film takes no judgmental stance when it could have become awfully ponderous.

Patrick's (Cooper) OCD behavior about his soon to be ex wife, Nicky, really began to grate on my nerves. I've known people like this, who won't shut about some love object they are stuck on it and it becomes as insufferable to the listener in real life as it does in this film.  However, I would guess that Russell, the director, wanted this reaction as it would be a common reaction to this obsessive compulsive behavior. Certainly it only adds to Cooper's performance.

Cooper is up for the Oscar.  He faces formidable opposition from Daniel Day-Lewis playing Lincoln, however.  Even if Cooper does not win, being a nominee is a big step upwards for his career.

The romantic part of this film prevents it from becoming a real downer about mental illness. A woman in his neighborhood, Tiffany, was recently widowed.  She is attracted to Patrick (Cooper). They begin hanging out together and soon she agrees to give a letter to Nicky if he participates in a dance competition with her. This woman is ably played by the meteoric  star Jennifer Lawrence. We get to see the dance competition and thankfully they do ok but the film does not turn into SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. The romance part of the movie will be universally liked and should help the film do well commercially. Lawrence is up for the Oscar but there is very stiff competition in this category.  Younger actors, like Lawrence, are also more frequently overlooked in favor of the veterans come awards time.

There is also humor to the film, most of it coming from DeNiro with the schemes he hatches relative to his obsession with the Philadelphia football team.  This is so extreme that he has been banned from the stadium. Maybe one shouldn't laugh at his OCD behavior on this but much of it was as funny as MONK doing his OCD detecting.  We all know though that DeNiro has great comic talent and he unleashes it here. He is up for supporting Oscar and I think his chances are very good.

5175815,5,B008OGIPJA,"Coming off the success of his previous film, the brilliant and superbly acted ""The Fighter"", David O. Russell brings us a story dealing with family issues, personal struggle, and the quest for happiness. The movie revolves around Bradley Cooper's character Pat, a man who lost everything due to an incident that landed him in a mental institution. When Pat gets out, he's determined to get his life back together while seeking out the silver lining in every situation. He meets Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who has problems of her own but agrees to help Pat reconnect with his wife.

The film walks a difficult tightrope, blending comedy and romance with the serious issues of mental health and family struggle. Russell does a great job of accomplishing this by staying sensitive to the material and knowing when to throw in some subtle humor. In fact, you could classify this film as a romantic comedy, albeit much smarter and sensitive than is typically seen.

Cooper continues to prove that he's more than just a pretty face, and is absolutely terrific here. There's a plethora of emotions felt by his character throughout the film and the actor is more than up to the challenge of portraying each one with sincerity. Equally impressive is Jennifer Lawrence, who's funny, sexy, intense, and mysterious, usually all at the same time. The chemistry between the two is very believable and there's some great dialogue between them throughout the movie. Another impressive performance comes from Robert DeNiro, who plays Pat's neurotic father with a Philadelphia Eagles obsession. Finally, the surprise of the film has to be Chris Tucker, who has been nearly non-existent for the past few years but gives a heartfelt and sincere performance.

This is a terrific film and one that is more than deserving of any awards it may win. It's a good lesson on looking at things differently and seeking out our own silver linings.",1358294400,2,1927,4.978260869565218
5175816,5,B008OGIPJA,"NOTE: This review DOES contain SPOILERS!

Let me say this one thing to ANYONE reading this review: ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a wonderful movie, and if you have not seen it you should do two things:

1. Literally, run out and see it.  Now.  You'll not see a finer ensemble movie this year.  Then,
2. Don't read anymore of this review until you do.

I am breaking from tradition here.  Generally, I like to write reviews that praise or criticize movies, making sure to tell minimal plot details and, above all else, not to divulge spoilers that might ruin the story for anyone who has not seen it.  This will not be the case here; I was moved enough by this superb movie to want to talk freely about it, and you should STOP HERE IF SPOILERS WILL UPSET YOU.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a masterful contradiction: a mainstream movie shot like an indie, its rough edges are expressed in broad strokes as well as personal details.  It is loud yet minimal; it is personal, yet speaks to all of us.  It is a movie that is probably about no one you can think of, yet it will resonate with an intimacy that will speak to all of us.

""We're not liars like they are,"" Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence in a bravura performance) said in defining her relationship with Pat (Bradley Cooper, truly splendid in this role), and she's right: their respective brushes with mental disorder have somehow left them without the ability to restrain the words we all think but never say.

These moments create comedy, but they can also be very uncomfortable.  We find out early they are broken people.  Pat, a teacher, was institutionalized for eight months after he left school early one day, found his wife in the shower with a fellow teacher and almost beat him to death.  Upon Pat's release he is invited to his friend Ronny's house for dinner and it is there he meets the recently widowed Tiffany, whose policeman husband died behind the wheel.  Though Ronnie specifically cautions him not to, his first words to her are, ""How did your husband die?""

It is a potentially alienating question, as is their conversation about the medication prescribed to ""help"" them.  Yet Tiffany responds to his honesty and a potential shaky bond is formed.  This candor is foreign to their host; Ronny himself had only just confessed to Pat how the very home improvements he had moments ago been bragging about are strangling him financially.  Urged by Pat to say this to his wife, his host frantically hushes him lest his wife might hear.

This openness has its limits; due to the particulars of her relationship with her husband at the time of his death Tiffany is now a recovering sex addict, and Pat's tendency to continually call her a ""slut"" quickly wears thin.  And his inability to see beyond his need to rehabilitate his relationship with his ex-wife Nikki is a continual barrier to his relationship with Tiffany moving forward.

Make no doubt about it: Pat is a broken man.  In fact, there are several scenes in the early part of the movie where Pat is seen reading Hemingway's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Farewell-To-Arms/dp/B002JMTV52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Farewell To Arms</a>&nbsp;in an effort to come to fully embrace his wife by reading her curriculum for the school year.  We laugh when he reads the ending of the novel and flings it out the window of his attic bedroom.  ""That book sucks!"" he shouts, complaining about the book's ending, wherein two lovers undergo tremendous hardships in WWI, escape to Switzerland and, when they are finally safe, she dies in childbirth.  He is enraged that Hemingway had the audacity to consider THAT a good and proper ending to a book.  (We'll return to AFTA later.)

What is so refreshing about ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is how it all fits together so well and bears up under further scrutiny beyond the simple words of the script.  Their drama may not be Shakespearean in language, but it is still one we recognize as eternal, and digging for symbols is a task refreshingly rewarded.

That Pat wears a black Hefty bag through which he's poked neck and arm holes is attributed to the moist Pennsylvanian weather, yet the fact that he sees himself as trash is not without merit.  He is continuously trying to better himself and his station so that Nikki will take him back, yet he is forever stymied by the court order forcing them apart.  That Tiffany offers to carry his letter to Nikki gives her a reason to see him, but her terms of the bargain forces him to continuously practice with her so that she may enter a dance contest some weeks away.  He agrees not only for the purpose of passing on the letter, but so that Nikki may see that he is bettering himself.

That Tiffany and Pat's first evening takes place on Halloween bears up as well, as they are the only ones that day unmasked.  Once inside the modest diner he has taken her to he, hilariously, orders Raisin Bran--the breakfast cereal--to make sure their night together is not seen as a formal date.  Understandably, their meal ends with her soon after storming out the door, and in her anger she cries out when he tries to mend things, arousing the public to her cause.  It is her betrayal of him that causes her to see him as a trapped and flawed individual, and she quickly calls off his tormentors.

He is alone (his last name, after all, is Solitano), as she is, and he needs someone fiercely--he simply has picked the wrong horse.  For a movie that relies upon gambling so much (more about that later on), is such a metaphorical comparison out of line?

It is also at that moment that she witnesses the anguish he feels whenever he hears the Stevie Wonder song ""My Cherie Amour,"" which was not only his wedding song but the song playing while his wife and her lover were showering.  Throughout the early part of this movie the song has plagued him, yet it is Tiffany's penchant for cutting through the superficial that causes her to shout, ""It's just a song; it's not a monster!"" and it is then he finally begins to place the song in perspective.

I have not even touched on the wonderful secondary characters in the movie--and how often can one apply such a term to Robert De Niro?  His character of Pat, Sr., has lost his job and is relying upon bookmaking to fund his construction of a restaurant he has dreamed about running all of his life.  While such a dream drives the action of the second half of ""Silver Linings,"" perhaps more important is De Niro's skilled portrayal of a faulted man run by his compulsions, a psychological disorder that also, certainly, had something to do with the Pat's upbringing.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic; he has recorded and catalogued every game they ever played.  This is odd, but perhaps not worthy of being called ""crazy""; yet we soon find out he has done the same with other items in his house, including blank envelopes. Now, THIS is a compulsion worthy of merit.

That Cooper's Pat has trouble with De Niro's Pat is not hard to fathom: after all, his father's repeated pleas to simply spend time with his son at first come across as a man's earnest desire to reconnect with his offspring, and we at first see the younger Pat as being callous for neglecting him.  Yet it is only later that we realize his father really has been harboring a secret motivation: he sees his son as ""lucky"" and wants to use him as one of his ever-present talisman.

It is wholly appropriate that when this all reaches a peak, it is Tiffany who sees them through it.
In fact, a few revelations later we find it is, as usual, the women who have been pulling the strings all along.  Not only did Tiffany, as she put it, ""do my research"" and point out to Pat, Sr. that his son has been a good luck talisman all along when in HER presence, but we find too that it is Pat's mother who had secretly helped Tiffany corner Pat all along.

But the climactic scenes, wherein EVERYTHING comes to a head--the relationship, the dance contest, the restaurant wager and the all-important meeting between Pat and his ex-wife Nikki--Tiffany and Pat finally reveal to each other their love.  ""I loved you when I first met you,"" he declares, ""I just didn't know it at the time.""

This is where the movie at once and at last unites with Hollywood and gives us the ""proper"" ending we've hoped for all along--against Hemingway's nihilism and against the cynicism one might expect here.  It is proper, though, that this one hope goes along with Hemingway's famous quote from ""A Farewell to Arms"" (as long as one doesn't read much farther): ""The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.""

It is quite possible to see just how Pat and Tiffany are, indeed, ""stronger at the broken places,"" and may now achieve their Hollywood ending after all.

5175819,3,B008OGIPJA,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot.

Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife.

The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in ""Farewell to Arms"" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs.

The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a ""we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.""

Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless.

I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was - eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being.",1357948800,10,3018,4.751908396946565

5175821,5,B008OGIPJA,"What kind of romantic comedy do you prefer? Classics, such as It Happened One Night, Pretty Woman and Roman Holiday, or something quirky, like Annie Hall or Harold and Maude? Silver Linings Playbook has more drama present than most romantic comedies, but it still belongs in that category. It would also be classified as somewhat quirky.

Mental illness isn't funny, but I don't think that any subject should be off limits when it comes to comedy. The key is doing it with respect and a degree of realism. For example, cancer is one of the most unpleasant things in existence, but 50/50 was a comedy that worked, because the screenplay allowed us to see some of the seriousness of the situation. Silver Linings Playbook follows the same path.

If you have ever seen As Good as It Gets, you might have some idea what to expect from Silver Linings Playbook. Both films feature incredibly good actors, who are capable of mixing drama with comedy. Both include serious scenes that an average actor might struggle with. The two stories revolve around unlikely romances, that shouldn't work, but it feels right when they do.

Jennifer Lawrence has to be one of Hollywood's hottest properties. She received an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone, and has reached huge audiences by appearing in X-Men: First Class, and The Hunger Games. I'm sure a lot of people saw Silver Linings Playbook just because Lawrence was involved. She's certainly attractive, but she can really act too. This role requires more than just a pretty face, and she pulls it off with apparent ease.

The setting reminds me of Russell's last film, The Fighter; it's gritty and realistic, and full of dramatic scenes. Families often become involved in shouting matches rather than sitting down to have rational conversations. Two actors won Oscars in that film, and I wouldn't be surprised to see another nomination go to Lawrence for her work here.

The story focuses on Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), who we see being released from a mental institution. He is married, and has plans to reconnect with his wife. He is friendly and calm most of the time, but can sometimes snap. One trigger is a song, and sometimes he hears it in his head when it's not even playing. Pat moves in with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert De Niro), and walks into their bedroom at 3am for insignificant reasons. His judgment is not exactly reliable.

Pat's life begins to change when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who is the sister-in-law of one of his friends. She's direct and irrational at times, and it soon becomes clear that she has problems of her own. The two enter into a sort of alliance and become friends. Tiffany agrees to give a letter to Pat's wife if he'll train with her and enter a dance contest that she wants to be a part of.

De Niro is funny in almost every scene in which he appears. He plays a Philadelphia Eagles fan, and he's convinced that his actions, and the actions of those around him, have an effect on the team's results. One of the best scenes in the film occurs when Tiffany confronts him about his superstitions.

Chris Tucker is also funny in all of his scenes. He was a fellow patient at the mental institution and seems to care about what happens to Pat.

Another huge plus is the soundtrack. Led Zeppelin finally allowed songs to be used in movies and ads, and the placing of What is and what should never be is particularly effective. You'll also hear The White Stripes, Alabama Shakes, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, and the Eagles of Death Metal. It's one of the best soundtracks of 2012.

I won't ruin the outcome, but it's fun to see Pat and Tiffany work through their problems. It's good to see a film avoid the usual romantic comedy formula and come up with some original ideas. Comedy works best when it surprises you, rather than something which tries to make you laugh with every action or line of dialogue. It's well-written and well-acted, with a number of memorable scenes. Catch it while it's still in theaters if you can.

5175822,4,B008OGIPJA,"This is a hilarious romantic comedy turned drama! The acting is great, the set up for the story is fascinating and laugh out loud funny at times. But it isn't without its problems.

Pat and Tiffany both have mental disorders that are played as humorous, but if we actually stop to think about the message this movie is sending this seems in poor taste. There are times where the disorders are thoughtfully depicted and the consequences clearly on display, and when this happens this movie shines. How Bradley Cooper plays Pat is one of the best performances of the year in any genre. He is completely convincing. Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is less so. We do find out why she is so caught up with sex, but the answers fell flat for me. She came off as less someone to feel sorry for and more someone to avoid. I think it's more the writing than the acting here, because later in the film, when it takes the easy way out for the finale, she all the sudden has interests and information that her character shouldn't have if she were really as lost as Pat.

One other thing: this movie is so vulgar at times that it shocked me out of my enjoyment of the film. Many of the newer films that are supposed to be romantic [something, be it drama, comedy, whatever] are so vulgar now that it makes date night less fun and romantic and more cringe worthy and uncomfortable for those of us who don't toss out the F-Bomb every few words. (SLIGHT SPOILER: For instance, the very first night they meet, Pat is walking Tiffany home - how that happens is brilliant - but then says to him out of nowhere, ""You can come in and F me if you want to if you turn out the lights"" (because she hates his Jets jersey.) Why?! The scene was hilarious and romantic and Tiffany was intriguing and funy ... and then ruined.

This is a very interesting, funny film that takes a few wrong turns.",1357344000,3,1863,4.378612716763006
5175823,5,B008OGIPJA,"On temporary leave from a mental institution, our bi-polar hero is frantic to reconcile with his ex, but his parents, who have signed for custody and are on the hook for his behavior, are understandably worried. Particularly when he seems to be interacting with a troubled young widow who is no more predictable than he.

In this engaging dramedy, we see a plot painted with broad strokes, but delivered by a cast capable of great skill and subtlety:
  * Bradley Cooper (""The Words"") is Pat, absolutely convinced that only one ""incident"" caused his problem and it can easily be explained. Of course what he views as ""normal"" might be the issue here...that plus the restraining order his ex-wife has filed.
  * Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") is Tiffany, a recent acquaintance with a questionable past, but it too, can be easily explained. This young widow is still working her way toward ""normal.""
  * Robert De Niro (""Limitless"") is Pat Sr., a cantankerous, controlling, obsessive compulsive, who wants to open a restaurant, but is willing to wager that his son won't let him down. From him we get a lot of insight into the family dynamics and what is considered ""normal.""
  * Jacki Weaver (""The Five-Year Engagement"") is Delores, the long-suffering wife and mother of our two favorite odd-balls. Chaos is ""normal"" for her.
  * Anupam Kher (""Bend it Like Beckham"") is Dr. Cliff Patel, our hero's therapist...  and a sports fan! He's still trying to define ""normal.""
  * Chris Tucker (the ""Rush Hour"" franchise) is Danny, escape artist par excellence! He met our hero in the mental institution; Danny may be crazy, but he's not dumb!

It is disconcerting to see a person deliberately refuse his medications, so I had a lot of misgivings about a movie that seems to endorse that behavior. On the other hand, we could see that the OCD apple didn't fall very far from the tree. I can only say that our hero's mother deserves to have her ample chest covered with medals!

In this R-rated film, expect lots of profanity, a glimpse of (maybe) nudity, no sweaty bodies, no gunshots and no blowie uppie stuff (except tempers, e.g., watch our hero when he finishes Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms!). Also expect to have people to root for, and an improbable bet that features a point spread.

Let me add that this movie includes the most memorable ""lift"" since ""Dirty Dancing.""

I've already pre-ordered this from Amazon.",1357344000,2,2425,4.830508474576271

5175825,4,B008OGIPJA,"We're used to seeing Bradley Cooper in movies like ""The Hangover"" and ""Wedding Crashers"".  So when I read a review of ""Silver Linings Playbook"", I was intrigued.  How would Cooper handle a challenging role like that of Pat Solatano, the bipolar mess of a main character in this movie, which was billed as a romantic comedy but is dark and gritty, more like an indie movie with a star like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Beautifully, is the answer, and he and the terrific cast of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" make this movie work.

In David O. Russell's gifted hands, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" becomes one man's struggle to right the world which he thinks has desperately done him wrong.  Pat (Bradley Cooper) is in deep trouble when we first meet him.  His mother cuts a deal with the courts for his early release from a mental institution in Baltimore and it is clear from the first that Pat is hardly ready for this transition.  He refuses to take the meds for his bipolar disorder, which was kicked into high gear when he discovered his wife in the shower with one of her teaching colleagues.  He almost beat this man to death, and despite institutionalization and group therapy, the rage is still boiling within.  At home, father Robert DeNiro is obviously walking a fine line himself.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic and has a plethora of OCD rituals which he employs before every game to ensure the team's victory.  Dad has anger issues also, and the two get into a fist fight before too long, so a cop is assigned to shadow Pat to ensure that he treads the straight and narrow.  At this point in the movie, it is difficult to find much humor.

Into this mix walks Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany).  We saw just a glimpse of this gifted actress in ""Like Crazy"", where she played The Other Woman with such finesse and sympathy.  Her character in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is much more complex, and she is a bit of a mess herself.  A young widow who reacts to her cop husband's untimely death with reckless promiscuity, she recognizes a kindred spirit in Pat.  She falls for him immediately, but he is too mired in his obsession with his wife to recognize it at first.  After cutting a sharp bargain with him, she begins spending a lot of time with Pat, and in turn this leads to redemption for both of them.

At first I thought the plot device tied up the threads of the story a little too neatly, but then I decided it hardly mattered.  The acting by the entire cast is stellar, and I especially enjoyed DeNiro and his football obsession.  There is a scene in the Eagles' football stadium that is just funny and terrific.  And Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry, which really makes it work.",1356998400,4,2709,4.6
5175826,1,B008OGIPJA,"The movie version of Matthew Quick's book doesn't know where to find the balance. As a viewer, I didn't know where to find the humor or the drama. Should we be laughing at the all too real struggles of deeply affected cartoon-like people? I didn't.

When it went for drama, the scenes were way over the top. I was supposed to buy into the relationship between Pat and Tiffany but they are both so unlikeable, I wondered why they would even want to hang out with one another. For example, the scene where they scream at one another in the diner, and she throws the bowls and glasses off the table would lead to the end of two people seeing one other. Of course, it's because they are mentally ill that they can form a relationship as 99.9999% of the rest of us wouldn't want to spend another second with such a person.

Of course, they are mentally ill seems to be the reason for all the ridiculous behavior displayed in this film---and yet we are supposed to embrace or laugh along with it.

5175829,5,B008OGIPJA,"You would think I couldn't like a romantic comedy that celebrates the Philadelphia Eagles and has dancing. That's a bad combination for me. I grew up in the Washington D.C. area and spent over half my life in the area watching and rooting for the Redskins through the 1980's and on winning three super bowls with great players like Gary Clark, Monte Coleman, Art Monk, Darrell Green, Charles Mann, Brian Mitchell, Mark Rypien and Ricky Sanders. I along with our family grew up hating the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. It's ingrained on our brains, and to be honest they suck. Any way it makes it harder for me to enjoy films that revolve around these teams, and then the romantic comedy factor. I'm not a big fan of the genre. Sure I've enjoyed some like Wimbledon, The Princess Bride, Pretty Woman and Sweet Home Alabama, but in general the genre sucks. I know the films are primarily made for women, but in most there is no chemistry between the leads, which makes the romance unbelievable. There is also usually the lack of character growth or predictable characters and in general the predictability of the genre. You know how it's going to end so the journey is the most important thing and if it isn't believable or the characters aren't likeable, compelling or you have a reason to root for the film fails. You would think with these two things going against Silver Linings that I wouldn't like it, but I did. I truly loved the Silver Linings Playbook.

First off of course the film is predictable. You know how it's most likely going to end from the trailer, but it's the journey getting there is what truly makes this film so good. The film is adapted from novel with the same name and by the author Matthew Quick. The story follows Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who's in a mental health institution in Baltimore after he loses everything in his life. His wife Nikki cheats on him with a fellow cheater from his school and he nearly beats the man to death. Pat loses his job, home, has a restraining order taken out by his wife, finds out that he is bipolar and ends up in a mental institution. The emotionally unstable Pat is taken out by his mother Dolores Solitano (Jacki Weaver) and brought home to Philadelphia where he'll live with his die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and bookie Pat Solitano Sr. (Robert De Niro). Arriving home Pat stops taking his pills and is determined to better his life, because he believes that if he does so Nikki will take him back even though his family and friends doubt that will happen. Hopping to get in contact with Nikki he goes to dinner with his friends Ronnie (John Ortiz) and Veronica (Julia Stiles) home where he meets Veronica's sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and had a break down as well going into deep depression. Almost instantly the two form a connection though Pat doesn't want to see it. The two scarred and emotionally unstable characters deal with their deep issues, their families as they form a bond helping each other and find a silver lining in their screwed up lives. I think that's all I'll talk about plot wise. As for the two main characters their believable and genuine and I had empathy and understood some of what they are going through. About twelve years ago I was put in a mental hospital for a short period of time and suffered from deep depression resulting in me taking pills. In fact I still suffer from occasional depression that that I take a pills for along with pills for blood pressure and I know what they can do to you and finding a silver lining in my at the time in my screwed up life. It can be anything or anyone like finding a friend or just dancing like Pat and Veronica do in the film as long as you find something that gives you hope. The characters are believable and real chemistry and as the film goes on you become invested in these characters and truly root from them to get together. The story and film even brought some tears to my eyes and I'm guy, and that rarely happens especially in romantic comedies, but this film is moving. Now as for the comedy is more muted and not over the top nor is it forced. It's believable and you actually think the characters would say what they do and it really works as I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I think it has more in common with a romantic drama that has humorous moments.

The small role Chris Tucker has in the film as Danny a friend of Pat's from the mental institution is Tucker's best acting performance to date. Sure he's not a great actor mainly doing comedy, but here he's not comedic side kick and actually shows more of his dramatic acting ability with his toned down comedy. Robert De Niro hasn't been at the top of his game over the last decade with performances in Killer Elite, Hide and Seek, Righteous Kill and Godsend, but he is still a good and capable actor. Is Pat Sr. the best character he's played no or is the character a little lacking yes, but De Niro brings the character to life and the emotional weight as Pat Sr. tries to connect to his son that he hasn't always been there for. John Ortiz does a good job as Ronnie, Pats good friend who tries to help Pat even though he's slowly suffocating in his own life. Obviously the film belongs to Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I'm not the biggest fan of Bradley Cooper or his acting ability. The only film I truly liked him in was Limitless. He showed off his acting ability which he puts on display in Silver Linings. He brings emotional depth to Pat and his struggles with accepting his Bipolar, deals with family issues and falls in love with Tiffany. For me Jennifer Lawrence is the star. I first noticed Jennifer, and her beauty in her supporting role in X-Men: First Class. I fell in love with her and her acting ability after seeing the Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games showing she could hold a film basically all by herself. She embodies Tiffany and truly brings the character to life showing of her acting range and ability. Jennifer should be nominator for an Oscar for her roles in The Hunger Games and Silver Linings. To be honest I think she should be nominated twice though that is by love and bias for the young actress. The only actress and character who I thought didn't work or was missed cast was Julia Stiles as Veronica. Julia just didn't look like she was emotionally there throughout her scenes in the film. Thank fully she was a sub-supporting actress and had only a limited number of scenes that didn't affect the film.

I sure did love the film Three Kings. It's a great and underrated war film about post war Iraq after the first Gulf War with a really good story and good performances by George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg. Until I saw Silver Linings Playbook, Three Kings was my favorite David O. Russell film. Though to be honest it's the only film of his I've seen. No I still haven't seen The Fighter and don't know when I will. In Silver Linings he again shows his ability as a writer and director bringing together the moving story and actors to make one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've seen. I'm not a big fan of Danny Elfman who performed the score with many of his scores sounding the same never bringing live to the films he does scores for, but he does a good job with the different moods and tones of the film helping to bring to the film to life.

I survived a genre I don't really like and film that surrounds itself with a team I hate and came out loving the film. Silver Lining is a nearly perfect film with great chemistry between the lead characters and actors with a believable story, great directing, music and it's only small flaw is with a few of its supporting cast. I know some people may have a different opinion and may not like it as much as I do, but in my opinion Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best films of the year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. The film deserves all the Oscar praise it's been getting and I hope it gets at very least nominations for best director, actor and actress. I loved the film and highly recommend it.",1356307200,7,8110,4.45191661062542
5175830,5,B008OGIPJA,"There may be spoilers.
There is plenty to admire in this David O. Russell film beginning with the performances.  Somehow Russell manages to skim the surface of traditional dark comedy but never truly allows the story to sink.  This is mostly because Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are perfect romantic foils as Tiffany and Pat.

Both are emotionally and psychologically damaged.  Pat Solitano (Cooper) is released from 6 months of hospitalization for criminally aggressive behavior.  After catching his wife (Brea Bee) in the shower with a fellow teacher, he nearly kills the guy.  Treatment rather than jail seemed like his only viable option.  After his mother (Jacki Weaver) gets him out, he refuses to take his meds, for all the usual reasons (they make me drowsy, incoherent, etc.)

At a dinner at his best friend's house he meets Tiffany, his friend's sister-in-law.  She has her own issues including promiscuity following her husband death.  He was a police officer.  Evidently, many of her friends at work were more than willing to take advantage of Tiffany's emotional weakness.  While there is always awkwardness between the two, Pat and Tiffany make a pact to help each other.

Pat still believes he has a future with his now estranged wife, restraining order notwithstanding.  Tiffany needs a dance partner at an upcoming contest.  Tiffany agrees to deliver a letter to the wife if Pat will be her partner.  An excellent screenplay by Matthew M. Quick provides some great lines and humorous zingers for both leads.  In one of his best roles in recent memory, Robert De Niro gives a wonderful (and Oscar-worthy) performance as Pat, Sr., himself full of Philadelphia Eagles hysteria, superstition and acute compulsive disorder.

Perhaps what makes this movie different from a traditional romantic comedy is that the film is believable.  Things aren't always pretty.  While improvements in the character's lives are there, they come in small steps.  When the film ends everything isn't perfect.  For example, when the couple goes to the dance contest at the end of the film, the final dance move involves Tiffany running toward Pat, who is to lift her above his head.  They have had problems with this move in practice.  We expect the move to work as we have seen in hundreds of other movies.  Here, just like in practice, Tiffany's crotch lands right in Pat's face.  Both Lawrence and Cooper manage to keep in the same character throughout the film.  Even as they take baby steps, they aren't cured at the end.  This is a solid, smart, award-worth film.",1356307200,2,2569,4.9811764705882355
5175831,5,B008OGIPJA,"This film began somewhat unevenly for me. Bradley Cooper's acting was a bit over the top and uncomfortable to watch. I'm not sure the mental illness he exhibits would really be described as bipolar, it's mostly just manic, bordering on schizophrenic. He does manage to calm down somewhat as it progresses, and does well. He's just a bit out of his league here.
Robert DeNiro is great playing, well, a Robert DeNiro-type character. His acting simply speaks for itself. Overall, the ensemble performance was first rate.
What really set this one apart was Jennifer Lawrence. Her range and credibility continue to resonate.  In this story, she plays a character somewhat older than her 21 years, and you don't doubt it for a second. She has the eyes and presence of one who many would describe as an old soul. Been here, seen this before. A reviewer of one of her earlier films, while not liking the movie all that much, describes her as an exquisite creature, one that the camera loves.
Another review of Silver Linings described it as her best performance to date. While it is an amazing, versatile display (not to mention the dancing ability she shows and, well...that body. Yikes), the reviewer must not have seen ""Winter's Bone"". That movie blows me away every time I watch it.
Yes, the ending on Playbook was a bit over the top, but so what. It felt great.

Without her, this one would probably have rated about 3 1/2 stars. With her, it's a  4 1/2 to 5. Hope she wins the Academy Award here she should have won earlier.",1355702400,6,1522,4.62962962962963
5175832,5,B008OGIPJA,"From the moment I saw the first trailer, I wanted to see this movie.  I finally got a chance to see it last month and I was not disappointed.  This is easily of of the best films of the year with probably the best cast of the year.  This film is based of the best selling book of the same name and David O' Russell captured it perfectly.  The film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano.  His mom has just picked him up from a mental institution in which he has spent the last eight months for assaulting his wife's lover.  Even though the doctors feel as though he needs more time there, Pat leaves and head home...well at least his parent's home.  Pat wants to get his life back on track and his wife back by working out, reading his wife's summer reading list for her class and work on his ""issues"" even though he believes he does not need his medication in order to do it.  This is going to be easier said then done because right after his fight with his wife's lover, she put a restraining order on him, she moved away and he lost his teaching job.  After being invited to dinner by his friend, Ronnie, he meets Tiffany.  A woman who has just lost her policeman husband and has issues of their own.  Even though things are rocky between to two of them at first, they eventually form an odd friendship.  When Pat learns that Tiffany has a personal connection to his wife, Nikki, the two of them strike up a deal.  If he agrees to be her partner at an upcoming dance competition, she'll agree to supply his wife a letter from him.  At first glance, this might seem like a crazy idea for a romantic comedy drama and that there is no way in hell that this could work.  Having said that, this film amazingly works.  Its funny, heartfelt, insightful and inspiring.  What makes it so good is that all of these people are not caricatures of people.  They are real people with real hopes, dreams and issues.  To me, the best characters are the ones we can identify with and you can do that to a certain extent with each of these characters.  David O' Russell directed and wrote this film.  I give him credit for being able to make a great film that included mental illness, the Philadelphia Eagles, comedy and drama all in the same film.  He got nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The Fighter (another amazing film) and should receive writing and directing nominations at the next Oscars.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly one of the best and brightest stars today.  Even though her character is suppose to be older and she was only 21 at the time of filming, she is completely believable as a damage woman looking for a silver lining in her life.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for Winter's Bone, gave another acclaimed performance in the huge blockbuster The Hunger Games and I see another Oscar nomination for this film.  She deserved the first one and she really deserves another one.  Robert De Niro is back ladies and gentleman.  After a few years of films and performances that were not that well received, he comes back with a vengeance in this film as Pat's OCD father.  Add to his list another Oscar nomination for this performance.  He walks the line of concerned father and superstitious Eagles fan beautifully.  Jacki Weaver was great as his concerned mom.  She earned a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for Animal Kingdom as the mom from hell and she does a complete 180 as as woman that wants to see her son get back on her feet.  I think she should get another one for this film.  Chris Tucker was in the film as Pat's friend from the mental institution and all I have to say is welcome back Chris.  We know him mostly as loud mouth characters from Money Talks, Friday and the hugely successful Rush Hour franchise.  He really tones it down to be a more realistic character and he is still funny as hell.  I don't know it it will happen but he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination because he was truly memorable in this film.  The rest of the supporting cast is great as well in their roles.  I reserve the highest acclaim for Bradley Cooper.  We mostly know him from comedies like Wedding Crashers, Hit and Run, and the highly acclaimed (and funny as hell) The Hangover.  Last year, he made a film called Limitless that showed that he does have some range.  His performance from Silver Linings Playbook takes that to another level.  This is not only his best performance to date but this is also one of the best performances of the year.  He was extremely believable as Pat.  Even though his character was highly troubled, we saw a guy that was really trying to get his act together.  You see Pat at his best and you see him at his worst.  You feel for him from the moment he leaves the mental hospital to the moment the film ends.  You really want him to get his silver lining.  If he is not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, it will be a travesty.  This is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best films ever made.",1355529600,4,4968,4.370087336244541
5175833,4,B008OGIPJA,"Now and then a movie comes along that works on nearly every level and bowls you over. For me, this was one of those movies.

Here's the scoop. Pat is bi-polar. He's just out of an institution, where he spent the better part of a year, after having beat up a guy he found in the shower with his wife. Now he's back with mom and dad and needs to put his life back together. He becomes acquainted with a local girl who has some serious baggage of her own. Together they work on getting back on track.

This is a near perfect film. It's shot in a very un-Hollywood style. There's a lot of hand-held camera and natural light. You feel as though you occupy the same space as the characters. The dialogue is outstanding and the performances are equally as good. De Niro is always good but I've grown a bit tired of him over the years. That disappeared while watching this. Here's a father who couldn't understand his son's problems as a child, and now is feeling the guilt in how those problems have nearly ruined his son's life. He himself has issues with obsessive, compulsive disorder. That he's lost his job and is working as a bookie is adding to the household problems. Mom does what she can but has to struggle to get her voice heard.

What really is happening here is the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. Brad Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany are great together. They dish out a lot of crap to each other, and there are a lot of fits and starts, but slowly they come to see something in each other. They take each other outside of their perspective comfort zones and that helps them move forward.

Unfortunately, it gets very Hollywood at the end and the script goes from being very natural to very contrived. It's a shame because up to that point it's as good as any movie you are likely to see. But don't be put off. The high points far outweigh the shortcomings.",1355356800,5,1885,4.377142857142857
5175834,1,B008OGIPJA,"The critics were wrong, AGAIN!

it was a boring movie for me Jennifer Lawrence was horrible and loved Bradley I should have waited to rent instead of wasting my money!

I should have learned that critics reviews are usually very wrong about movies cause boy were they wrong about this one. Well lesson learned. After ravings and ravings about the amazing Silver Linings Playbook movie from critics and people I was excited to see this movie, I was gonna see it anyway because I loved the book, and come on this was an amazing cast, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert, this is a dream cast. Boy was I super duper disappointed! How in the world this movie got all these awards beats me, well I think because this was such an amazing cast everyone makes themselves or wants themselves to like this movie, cause that's the only reason I can think of. As badly as I wanted to believe the hype and make myself like it because the cast was amazing, I could not lie to myself. It was an utter disappointment. Of course I have a bunch of people telling me I'm wrong just because this movie has a dream cast everyone says it's amazing but they don't explain why it's amazing. Well why do I dislike it? Well the acting would be one of the many problems with this movie, Jennifer's acting in this movie was way over rated. Of course I get comments like ""your just a hater"" well let me tell you that I'm not because I loved her in the hunger games, she carried that film, so no I'm not a hater. Robert was also a disappointment, he just didn't bring his A game into this film. Another problem with this film is that it's one thing for this to be a book but it's another thing to make this into a movie, a comedy movie. I see nothing funny with making fun of illness. Another problem is that for me this movie had to do with more football and dancing then what the book was about and that was also a very huge disappointment, I'm going to get more comments from people who already have an opinion on this movie telling me that I'm wrong or I didn't explain something correctly so therefore I'm wrong about the whole thing or my opinion sucks or I'm boring just because I dislike this movie and blah, blah, blah! It's just annoying, it seems that people forget that this is just my opinion, MY POINT OF VIEW on this movie. I guess they have nothing better to do then to just go on all the 1 star reviews and tell us how wrong we are. But if I can at least stop one person from seeing this movie then I'd done my job. But hey I'm just as upset because this was such an amazing cast, wasted on a movie that turned out to be horrible. I almost walked out on this movie, but I stayed hoping it would get better as the book did but it just didn't. This movie had very few laughs. The movie was just very dull to me. The script was a mess. I also wasn't fine with the fact how they changed some scenes in the movie. Yes I understand it's a movie and they have to do that. I will never go into a movie with such hopes again, no matter how many critics and people say it's amazing, lesson learned! So I guess I shouldn't have such high hopes for the hunger games: catching fire.",1354838400,19,3162,4.2161716171617165
5175835,5,B008OGIPJA,"I never write reviews, but I just HAD to for this film. I highly recommend it. Great dialog, great acting, great script, etc. Oscar worthy!",1354752000,3,139,4.6
5175836,5,B008OGIPJA,"If you live with mental illness to a large degree, this film will resonate with you. You will understand completely the Bipolar mania that is usually so hard to describe, let alone act out. Bradley Cooper is perfect. His emotional highs and lows and so intense and spot-on, it's easy to root for him even though you're also quite scared of the next outburst. Jennifer Lawrence is superb and matches Cooper's intensity take for take. She was a favorite character among a perfect cast. She's also got an ass that won't quit, but that has little to do with how wonderful the movie was.

The sexual tension is palpable, without there being more than one scene of sex that doesn't even include the two favored characters! That's good writing...when you can feel the emotion between the lines without everything being spelled out for you. One look shared between characters and the tears immediately start to rise because you just...GET IT. OK, I know that I am being a cheesy girl right now, but seriously. I mean it.

Go see it.",1354579200,5,1024,4.683333333333334

5175838,4,B008OGIPJA,"Silver Linings Playbook is a mixture of light rom.com and dark look at mental illness. It starts off funny and ends with an explosion of smaltz. Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper)is released after 8 months from a state psychiatric institution after having nearly beaten a man to death,into the care of his mother(Jacki Weaver) and father(Robert De Niro).He is a handful and very explosive,waking up in the middle of the night,telling his parents he doesn't accept a Hemingway book he's reading,then proceeding to turn over the house to look for his wedding video. His wife Nicki has taken out a restraining order against him. He wants to slim and read through all her high school English books, improving himself to get back to her. Then he meets the mysterious Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a young widow who's just as volatile and medicated as himself. She agrees to help blunt and tactless Pat rebuild his marriage but has an odd favour to ask in return,to join her in a dance competition and train with her for it. David  O'Russell is good on indie-type films like Three Kings,Spanking the Monkey. This has an indie sensibility.

This film has some outstanding performances especially the central one of Jennifer Lawrence,without whom the film would have dropped off the radar. De Niro too is superb as the father who wants to bond with his son and opens himself up,yet also seeks to integrate him into his life,yet is at the receiving end of the potential violence Pat is able to unleash. Jacki Weaver is good as the mother who thinks everything can be made right with crab-cakes. Chris Tucker is good also as a fellow sufferer he met in the institution. There are some well-rounded cameos of minor characters and scenes,e.g. when Tiffany and Pat go to have a meal at Tiffany's friend Veronica's and Tiffany and Pat are just too honest,saying they want to leave half way through,not interested in the lies and half-truths of suburban life. Pat has a tendency to get into fights,a characteristic he shares with his dad. I thought Cooper had a tendency to mistake quirkiness for bipolarity and mixed the two up. I also think the dance competition/rom.com dissipates the real urgency of the mental illness as a subject. One for the Oscars and prepare to take your hankies! Entertaining rather than deep. The silver lining of Hollywood.",1353974400,5,2328,4.906091370558376
5175839,4,B008OGIPJA,"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a feel-good movie about mental illness.  It does an excellent job of showing folks who are just barely capable of living in society due to their various afflictions, but then it implies that just some peace, love and understanding are all that's really needed to push the problems away.

We meet Pat (Bradley Cooper) as his mother (Jacki Weaver) is signing him out of an institution he has living in for the past 8 months.  He is, it would seem, severely bi-polar and but is obsessed with the idea of reuniting with his wife (who cheated on him and now has a restraining order against him, since he beat the snot out of the guy who cuckolded him).  To this end, he has developed a strategy of working out and of looking for the silver lining in bad situations.  He's trying to a) reshape his body, and apparently he has lost some weight & b) change his way of thinking.  He's able to stick with his running, but struggles a bit more with his internal life.  His illness has turned him into a deeply humorless person...everything that is said he either twists into being about him, or he doesn't listen to it if it isn't directly relevant to him.  He doesn't really joke or understand jokes.  Everyone is out to thwart what he's working on.  And heaven forbid anyone imply that he's not going to reunite with his wife...he's focused like a laser on that idea, and if something gets in his way, he either gets confused or lashes out in anger.

His mother brings him home, where his father (Robert DeNiro) awaits.  This man has serious OCD, and is one of those sports fans who believes things like the way he holds his remote control can affect the outcome of his beloved Philadelphia sports games.  He is also a small-time bookie who enjoys making bets himself.  His is a modest tyrant of his household, thus making everyone a slave to his compulsions.  He isn't quite as overtly ill as his son, but that may be because he has more years of living with his illness under his belt.

One day, Pat is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a volatile young widow with some fairly serious issues of her own to overcome.  She has recently lost her job due to sleeping with EVERYONE in her office, and now she is somewhat adrift.  She latches on to Pat, and manipulates him into being her dance partner for an upcoming competition.

The movie is HIGHLY entertaining.  Writer/director David O. Russell continues to show that he has a nice eye for middle-class, working-stiff neighborhoods (as in THE FIGHTER).  He's got a great ear for dialogue that his great cast can really chew into, and his directing style is unobtrusive.  I note this, because he CAN direct movies that have very strong visual flair (the fantastic THREE KINGS)...but that isn't needed for SILVER LININGS.  This is a character driven film.  It's a drama with plenty of comedy.  It's a romance with a minimum of saccharine.  I say minimum, because sadly, there is some in what I think is a far too neat and tidy ending.  The movie spends so much time showing how untidy and messy the lives of all these characters are, and it betrays that very carefully developed understanding. I assume the movie has the same ending as the book it was based on.

The real fun of the film IS the performances...watching these actors tear into the great dialogue.  Bradley Cooper has never been one of my favorites.  He's often very smug and self-satisfied in a way that seems to be more about him than his characters.  But here, he's brought a bit down to earth, and is thus quite effective.  While I don't agree with the Oscar-buzz I've been hearing about him, he is very good.  I DO agree with the buzz about Jennifer Lawrence.  With this film, THE HUNGER GAMES and WINTER'S BONE, there need no longer be any debate about her versatility and value...she is one of the top young actresses of the day.  Now all she needs is a flat-out comedy or farce, and she'll have tackled everything.  And Robert DeNiro is back!  For years now, he's been collecting paychecks by impersonating himself.  He was very funny in MEET THE PARENTS and ANALYSE THIS, but those roles seemed fresh and funny and self-effacing.  Then those roles were ALL he did.  Comedies where he played the Robert DeNiro character.  Or he'd do something like RIGHTEOUS KILL, a more serious movie that required him to do little more than glower and look menacing.  But Russell has gotten a serious, fully-rounded performance from him here, and he's great.  For me, a big DeNiro fan, that alone makes the movie worthwhile...to show that DeNiro still has the chops and the will to give a great performance.  I just hope he does more of this.  And Jacki Weaver, as the mom, is great as well.  She gives DeNiro a great character to play off of.

Despite my reservations about the ending, I have no hesitancy in saying that this is a movie well-worth seeing.",1353801600,5,4890,4.593533487297922
5175840,4,B008OGIPJA,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" has had Oscar buzz surrounding it for what feels like forever. It first debuted here in Houston during the Cinema Arts Festival earlier this month, but critics, entertainment blogs and magazines, and anyone who's seen the film who has a working mouth and all of their fingers have done nothing but praise this film. Speaking as someone who could care less about what films win awards and what don't, the Oscar campaign revolving around the film is falling on deaf ears. Just focus on being a fantastic film first and let the accolades come to you. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" certainly deserves the praise.

Eight months ago, a teacher named Pat (Bradley Cooper) came home to find his wife in the shower with another teacher. Pat lost it, was diagnosed as bipolar, and has spent his time in a mental institution ever since. Now, with permission from the court, his mom (Jacki Weaver) has come to take him out. Even though Pat is in his parents' custody and has a restraining order against him, he believes that he and wife Nikki (Brea Bee) are still very much in love. Pat eventually meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who's also having a rough time since her husband of three years suddenly passed away. Since Tiffany also recently lost her job, Pat begins to realize that the two of them have more in common than he once thought even if they can't stand to be around each other.

This is the best Bradley Cooper has ever been. Being one of the few people who's actually a fan of some of his different outings such as ""Limitless"" and ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" it was still surprising how good he was here. Maybe it's because everyone seems to automatically label him with that raunchy, obnoxious, R-rated comedy label whenever you see his face, but you just don't expect to be taken aback by a Bradley Cooper performance. This is Cooper offering a serious spin on being in a mental institution. His outbursts, his devotion to his wife who hasn't shown any sort of reciprocation, and just his display of raw emotion is undeniably superb.

In the same breath, you have to recognize Robert De Niro in this as well. When was the last time De Niro cried in a film? Can you recall? Has he ever? He's so emotional here, which seems extremely uncharacteristic of the 69-year-old actor. His yearning to spend time with Pat, his random OCD, and violent past seems to haunt him now more than anything. It's almost as if he constantly wants all of these things he'll never fully be able to grasp. It's a very different turn for De Niro.

Even with the strong performances from both Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" wasn't really as great as everyone was making it out to be until Jennifer Lawrence came along. This is the most adult performance of hers so far and she knocks it out of the park. Tiffany seems completely devoid of emotion at first and is very blunt; sometimes says exactly what's on her mind when she probably shouldn't like Pat. But she begins to open up the more the two of them spend time with one another and it's her chemistry with Cooper that makes the film reach such incredible praise. The scene at the diner is just outstanding as is every time Tiffany surprises Pat when he's out jogging.

This is the story of extremely flawed individuals that are written so well that they're easy to relate to. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro give career best performances while Jennifer Lawrence proves that we've only seen a glimmer of what she's truly capable of as a talented actress. Laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the most genuine and human films of the year.",1353715200,10,3772,4.649175412293853
