The audio sounded like in my bathroom, and the score was too loud. I give it one more star because it kept my 6& 7 yr old kids' attention.",1517443200,,261,3.8518518518518516
8740442,4,B017S3OS8G,"You can tell that most of the actors are new at their job, but I think the story line was very funny.  An adopted girl is treating her  new family horribly so her adoptive sister and relative (who are witches) teach her a lesson by planning to turn her into an animal. They tried several different ones, but she ends up a cat. It is crazy after that.  I enjoyed it.",1515456000,,365,4.112676056338028
