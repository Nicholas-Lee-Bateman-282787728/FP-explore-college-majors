The claims of the latter are strong, particularly in their remastered state. Even so, it is always good to behold Karajan and the Berlin Phil in full flight.

Karajan was always more persuasive in Brahms' first two symphonies than the remainder: like so many other great conductors, he never quite nailed the Third - not observing the key repeat in the first movement undermined his cause - and nor was he able to replicate Furtwangler's ferocity in the Fourth though his October 1963 performance came close. Even so, when he was on song - as he is here - there is no better advocate of the Second. Not one of his many recordings ('47, '55, '63, '73 [DVD], '77 and '86) is anything less than superlative. The stillness that he imparts to the orchestra in the first movement is the work of a Master - it truly is, as Osborne states ""light as seen from the heart of the forest"". The last movement is flawless - it is the very definition of controlled momentum.

Similarly Karajan's First exhibits enormous grip. If it lacks the warmth of the famous '63 performance - and this is debateable - it brings more power to the table. Indeed, as soon as the first note sounds, it is an express train to the final bar - and nor does one want to alight either. The tracery of strings that accompanies the horn call in the last movement is wondrous.

Throughout both symphonies, the bravura of the Berlin Philharmonic is astounding. At the time of release, the Penguin Guide commented on their visceral excitement: it is infectious.

As with most of these Sony / Karajan DVDs, the directing is unimaginative - the same number of set-shots are shown over and over again - but the calibre of the music-making offers absolution.",1313539200,2,1954,5.021604938271605
8243632,1,B00122M2EW,"I have no idea how good the recordings of the Brahms symphonies are, because my DVD player cannot accept the disc, which is ""Zone 4"".  My biggest question is why on earth would Amazon.com, normally a wonderfully efficient marketplace, sell Zone 4 DVDs to ignoramuses like me who just assume they wouldn't do such a thing, and didn't know there was even a difference?",1254355200,4,366,4.71875
