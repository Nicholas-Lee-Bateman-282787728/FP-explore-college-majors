8201396,5,B000RMJ5V6,"As usual, this installment of the Battlefield series achieves the highest levels in both entertainment and information broadcast.  The Battlefield series falls into the military genre obviously but anybody could truly enjoy these all-time pieces of entertainment and informational broadcasting.  Bravo a must have!",1384214400,,314,6.113636363636363
8201397,2,B000RMJ5V6,"We were primarily interested in the battle of Monte Cassino, as my husband fought there.  Very little of the DVD was devoted to the actual battle there, which was disappointing for us.  Also, the format was fragmented, so that you were given the same information over and over again.  The DVD was not what we were expecting.",1355702400,4,324,4.649122807017544
8201398,3,B000RMJ5V6,"More info than just Monte Cassino. On the part about the invasion of Sicily the friendly fire on the paratroopers was pretty much overlooked. Several times throughout, video clips are seen more than once. The weakest point is there are not many quotes from soldiers, just a few from the generals, there aren't any soldiers letters to home or any modern day inverviews. But still good enough for me to buy other videos in the series.",1310688000,2,432,4.697368421052632
8201399,2,B000RMJ5V6,"I was personally disappointed. I have been researching teh First Special Service Force. A special commando type unit with 9000 Canadian and 900 Amercian soldiers. This unit was the first unit of this type and is the fore father to our present day Special Forces, Delta Force. They wer ver instrumental in the battles to secure teh Liri Valley by conquering Monte Cassino, Monte Defensa Monte Retensia and all teh major battles. This movie depicts good old Monty (Montgomery, Great Britain) as the conquering hero in Iyaly, while actually he was very reluctant to take the lead, holding back waiting for the allies, especially the United Statees Units to take the lead. Anyway back to the First Special Servicce Force. They scaled the shear cliffs of Monmte Defenda catching the Germans by surprise and run them of the Monte, which all other allied forces had failed to do in the previous six months. The First Special Service Force was also teh very first allied unit to march into Rome ahead of Patton, Monte and the rest.

Pretty good actual footage, but very disappointed in the portrayal of teh bloodiest battle of the WWII.As a retired military man and student of the war in Italy, I have no idea why we thought that real estate was worth the thousands of lives it cost. LTG Mark Clark said after the war ""If we hadn't bomed the Abby we would have obtained our goal with much less lives lost"". The battle ground of Monte Cassino, the Liri Valley cost thousands of lives to satisfy three or four Generals quest to be in Rome before the other --- and none of them were first!",1293235200,3,1578,4.635714285714286
8201400,4,B000RMJ5V6,"I consider the Battlefield series to, generally, be a good documentary series on the battles and campaigns of WWII even though they are sometimes misnamed as in this case.

This DVD covers not only the battle for the heights above Cassino including the ancient abbey, but the Italian campaign as a whole. As such it does a fairly good job of telling the story of the campaign, the leaders of both sides, the weapons and forces available to both sides.

The DVD covers the initial landing by the British 8th army on the ""heel"" of the Italian peninsula and the US landings at Salerno. The DVD covers the battle for Monte Cassino, the amphibious landing at Anzio, the capture of Rome (as well as the opportiunites missed during that ""race for Rome"") as well as later fighting in the north of Italy. It shows the hard, slugging match northward in which the Germans made use of the geography of Italy to create a series of defensive lines that had to be frontally assaulted in actions reminiscent of the trenches of WWI. The video does a good job of showing how the Italian weather affected offensive operations.

The actions of commanders are analyzed and, as one would expect, Mark Clark comes off rather badly while ""Smiling Albert"" Kesselring is correctly shown as a commander who could consistently get the best effort with the much smaller resources he had to work with.

My only serious negative critique of this DVD is that it fails to look at the campaign from a larger strategic picture and ask why it was even fought at all? Italy's geography, with a mountainous ""spine"" running the length of the country and numerous, defensible rivers make Italy a perfect place for conducting defensive warfare. The fact of the matter is that the British did not want to face the Germans on the continent in any meaningful way, preferring to let the Soviets bear the brunt of european combat while deflecting the Americans to fights at the periphery such as North Africa, Sicily and Italy.

This is a good video on the Italian campaign and I recommend it with four stars.",1286496000,,2063,4.6878453038674035
8201401,4,B000RMJ5V6,"This is actually a documentary of the entire Italian campaign including the battle of Monte Cassino.  Due to the broader subject matter, it does not (and cannot) cover this infamous battle in the depth that I had been hoping for.  It should be named, ""The Italian Campaign"".  Otherwise, a decent documentary.",1196640000,20,308,5.0
