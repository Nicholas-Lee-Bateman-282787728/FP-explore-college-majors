5124630,5,B0083C1D9E,"By far, this is the definitive flick that defines Zhang Zi Yi as an accountable actress. Every smile, every grimace every facet of the human emotion carries her straight  through this well-written and executed movie. It got my wife jealous, (so I watched it again in secret) because my Asian wife is so much like the character that is portrayed here. Great designs and contrast in wardrobe and the set. Forget the lack of English dub, you won't need it. The story plays like an open book. Exit the scandal junk , forget the negative liaisons from the mainland, I'm greeting this memoir like nothing happened. And to us, nothing truly did. Admire-ring this actress 's talent from afar, her true spiritual aspect gave her acting ability great credence. Great supporting cast , fun movie.",1371427200,,785,4.814814814814815

8524417,4,B0083C1D9E,A fun movie. It is a bit of a departure for Zhang Ziyi to do a comedy. Maybe that is why she was one of the producers on the film to act in a movie that's not a drama.,1502755200,,167,3.3076923076923075
8524418,4,B0083C1D9E,"Fun vengeance flick, where a girl is dumped and decides to get revenge on her ex, that ex who is a surgeon left her for a movie star he treated, that was undergoing the exact same operation where he met her years before.  It's a movie that isn't trying to take itself seriously at all, Sophie's Revenge is just a lot of fun, with the unique energetic, physical bizarre pop culture humour style you only get from China, Korea and Japanese youth female characters. Language is Mandarin with English subtitles.",1498521600,,507,4.633333333333334

The disk had no scratches on it and played smoothly. Other than the random piece of tape on the cover it was brand new. This is one of my favorite movies so I was super excited when it came in a day early. So it shipped fast too. I would buy from this seller again.,1401148800,,419,3.772727272727273
8524426,5,B0083C1D9E,"A joint film venture between China's ""Beijing Perfect World Co."" and Korea's ""CJ Entertainment"", this movie, ""Sophie's Revenge"", brings a fresh take on a timeless formula.  Being light and optimistic, while carrying substantial themes and messages, coupling that with a smooth and professional delivery and presentation; this film will definitely touch many hearts and bring tons of laughter to one's soul.

CONTENT ISSUES:  The film is virtually clean with no real issues.  The only thing that comes closest to being a little (and I stress ""little"") problematic is the opening scene where the initial conflict point is introduced:  Sophie peeks in on her boyfriend cheating on her with another woman (named Joanna).  It is clear that those two are about to ""get it on""...but the scene doesn't last long enough to consummate that, and you don't actually see any clothes come off (though Joanna does take off her shirt, but you only see the top of her shoulders [about half an inch] and above...not even cleavage or whatnot).  Language is not a problem, neither.

BACK TO THE FILM...

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS): I won't recap the plot line since there is a fair enough explanation of the plot from both the product description as well as other reviewers.  I'm sure you've got the basic idea, by now.  What I will point out is that though the general plot is ""generic"", the execution and writing is so imaginative and creative that it does bring a fresh take to an old formula.  Actually, it's really charming and endearing.  The writing is smart and does draw you in.  The pacing is phenomenal.  There were many points that warmed your heart and points where you couldn't help but shake your head (as in that's what the director intended...not that it was badly written).  Also, there was just enough ""cheese"" to keep it light and enjoyable, but not so much that it destroyed it.  Also, substantial substantial themes and messages were thrown in, but they were never weighty.  In fact, they helped to add one more good layer of depth to this film.  I also really enjoyed the sectional format the film took.  The main character is a comic book author, so they made excellent use of that in how they partitioned the various portions of the film.  The pacing was a near perfect balance of slow and fast.  It really matched the kind of film this was, a romantic comedy.

CHARACTERS:
The actors and actresses did an awesome job!  They showed exceptional versatility...especially the female lead.  She really captured both the serious aspects all the way to the quirky aspects of her character.  The general chemistry of the cast was believable and lovable, too.  That said, many of the characters do not develop much through the course of the movie.  The main lead does a little, though.

CINEMATOGRAPHY AND BLOCKING:
I need to make a special note for the cinematography and stage blocking.  The movement and placement of the actors was very intentional and well positioned to great effect.  That led to a lot of awesome points of humor and interesting ways to present situations.  Also, the cinematography was just as intentional and creatively done.  They really used it as an active element to help create illusions of time progression to even adding to the humor.  I like it when directors seem to be aware of all elements of film crafting and use them to greatest effect...striving for the most excellent presentation they can.  I also loved how he brought back a sense of fantasy and magic through it...even though this is urban China.  The lighting was phenomenally used, as well!

MUSIC:
The music was often beautiful at points, and beautifully quirky at other points.  What's more, just like the intentional cinematography and blocking to accentuate the plot and script, the composer wrote music that would actively work in tandem with the script as well.  It wasn't just mood music, but also meticulously choreographed with the actions to be a part of the humor and general visual experience.

ALL IN ALL...
this was an amazingly fun film to watch.  After watching too many melodramatic films and whatnot, this was a very refreshing experience.  What's more, it is not pure randomness but still quite meaty in it's themes and messages.  The meticulous crafting of this film really displays the director's desire to entertain excellently.  In the end, it reminded me of the magic of living.",1390694400,2,4397,4.883783783783784
