But a nice collector's item.
Should have subtitles.
'Schlang' is hard to understand if only spoken....
James Franciscus is to cute to be......Spoiler!!!!!",1346889600,,206,5.2727272727272725

8481496,3,B005OK0YKM,"THE MUGGER is about a prolific madman on the loose, who always slashes the faces of his female victims in the exact same way. The police are baffled, so police psychiatrist, Dr. Pete Graham (Kent Smith) tries to discern his psychological motivations. Dr. Graham becomes sidetracked by a cab driver, Eddie Baxter (James Franciscus- THE VALLEY OF GWANGI, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE CAT O' NINE TAILS) who is having trouble w/ his sister in-law. Meanwhile, THE MUGGER strikes again and again! Will this maniac be stopped before every woman in town is wearing his terrible trademark? Graham continues to follow up leads in hopes of a break in the case. Another mugging takes place. This time, it's a homicide. What's worse, the victim is Baxter's sister in-law! Has THE MUGGER changed his M.O ., or has someone else committed this crime? THE MUGGER is a fairly predictable, though serviceable crime-thriller. The final revelation / confrontation is still exciting. While Kent is fine as Dr. Graham, it's his fiancee, policewoman, Claire Townsend (Nan Martin) who is the most interesting, and I'm not just saying that because she's beautiful! Not at all! Nope! Is it hot in here?...",1416182400,,1186,4.964824120603015
