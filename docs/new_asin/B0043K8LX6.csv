8415026,1,B0043K8LX6,"I'm a fan of both Arnold and Van Damme, but I bought this 4-pack just to watch ""JCVD"".  I had heard that it got rave reviews. So why am I giving this movie just one star? Because for his own personal reasons, the Muscles from Brussels suddenly decided to portray himself as a skinny, pitiful little geek.  Hell, If want to see a geek, I just look in the mirror. I don't need to pay money for a DVD or a movie to see a geek.  Van Damme made a big mistake in killing his superhero image.  So I'm going to ignore this movie because I'm sure hell defeat his personal demons and realize that he needs to either retire or get back to being the superhero that his fans expect and want him to be.",1517011200,,688,4.036764705882353
8415027,3,B0043K8LX6,"I also own Action 4 pack volume 2 starring Chuck Norris. The only reason I bought this DVD was to get Raw Deal. A very rare to find action movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. This was one of his first main roles. Raw Deal was released in 1986 only 2 years after his blockbuster The Terminator. I am a big fan of Schwarzenegger. I've been trying to get this movie for a good deal and here it is. Only paid $4 for it. The movie itself is not that great like I expected it. JCVD is a drama starring Van Damme (of which I am also a big fan). As for the other 2 movies, I didn't even watch yet. All 4 movies are in ONE disc and are in English only. There are no movie menus or audio options. So, there are NO subtitles either or a scene selection menu. A very simple form of DVD. Reminds me of VHS. Just select the movie you want to watch and press play. The audio and/or picture are not the best either but are average at most. Anamorphic widescreen 16x9 all movies.",1488758400,,964,4.078947368421052
