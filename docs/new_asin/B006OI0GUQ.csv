5009276,5,B006OI0GUQ,"A pretty good look at the Life of Joe Meek, the Phil Spector of England.  Although he was tone deaf, he had a knack for creating melodies.  His apartment studio was crammed with audio gadgetry which allowed him to experiment with sound.  When Telstar I was launched on July 10, 1962, he was inspired to lay down the catchy few bars that would become the first number one pop rock hit by a British band in the US.  ""Telstar"" by the Tornados has been covered at least 273 times by other bands, making it one of the most recorded instrumentals of all time.  I won't spoil the ending, but Meek's bipolar personality, and probable OCD make for a harrowing and insightful look at the music scene in the early 1960s.",1346112000,10,709,4.423076923076923

This started out so well that I thought I might be in for one of the best movies I'd ever seen. The exceptionally crisp opening scene stuffs about five minutes of exposition into one, then a truly exemplary credit sequence not only provides endless split-screen eye candy but also clues us into the basics of where we are and how we got there. Genius, one of the best opening few minutes of any film I can think of.

Buuut, then things begin to slow down and never really pick up. Con O'Neill is very good indeed, as are almost all of the actors, but the script is about 30 minutes too long. The story drags on and as Joe's life unravels so does this film. By the end I was just glad it was over.

Spacey's opening scenes are wonderful and you'd hardly recognize him. But then his Brit accent seems to fade as the film goes on and his role loses its lustre. It was funny to see portrayals of the young Ritchie Blackmore and Mitch Mitchell (his gun scene is a highlight), but the Blackmore guy was just lame at faking guitar playing. RB was and is a true guitar great, even on his early Joe Meek cuts, and this guy is clueless. Bad casting.

There are some fine moments scattered throughout, however, and Con carries this one all the way. Meek's gayness is dealt with pretty well, and his obsession with Heinz comes across with real edge. But the film shines most in its light moments, and as it wears on Meek's life has precious few of them, so don't expect fun and games after the first hour.

Worth seeing if you recall the great Telstar fondly (it is a classic tune, no doubt), or are interested in the London music scene back then, or just find bios of odd genius types interesting.

But if you really love great film making and ever get a chance, do watch
that opening few minutes. Pure genius.",1332374400,6,1810,4.32448377581121
5009278,3,B006OI0GUQ,"I'm old enough to remember when the pop hit ""Telstar"" was first released in the US and the impact it had. I knew that Producer Joe Meek was responsible for it and that - like Phil Spector - he was an ""eccentric"". So I was looking forward to this DVD of the 2008 film made in England. As I looked at the opening credits I didn't recognize any of the actors' name except Kevin Spacey and when he appeared on the screen I hardly recognized him.

As the 119-minute film began I watched as Spacey - as a plastics company owner who was funding Meek on his first record - and Meek (Con O'Neill) started running around the make-shift studio on the second floor, above a handbag store, and yelling. For at least the next 20 minutes the film had this high energy and lots of yelling (and MANY expletives - not that that's wrong but making you aware of them). The film jumps back and forth between Meek's first production and his death - 6 years later. This can be confusing and the Director puts in a lot of symbolism too.

Meek was certainly a strange guy - not unlike Spector in many ways - and had internal
demons to deal with. He was gay - in a period when this was not openly acceptable - and used his ""love"" for the mono-syllable-named Heinz - to promote the career of this guy who - though early in his career was ""backed"" by the Rolling Stones! - couldn't really sing. And we have ""drop in"" lines such as when Meek is offered to work with both the Beatles - before they hit it big - and ""some Welsh guy named Tom"", who he also turns down to concentrate on his artist/lover Heinz.

The film continued and kept repeating itself - at least for me - and, though we learn some things about Meek's two ""hits"" (the other was ""Have I The Right?"" under the group name Honeycone) , the film seems to go on forever. The director used the actual recordings for the soundtrack but the lip-synching seemed fake. The film is graphic as well with implied sex and gore at the end (sorry if you think this is a ""spoiler"" but you need to know where it's heading before looking forward to the standard ""pop music bio"".

After I finished watching it, I knew a bit more about Meek than before but felt that the two hours could have been better served.

There are no extras here except the film's trailer.

Other reviewers - especially Meek fans - will probably disagree with me but I can't really recommend this DVD to anyone other than a die-hard fan of the early British rock scene.

I hope you found this review both informative and useful.

5009279,5,B006OI0GUQ,"Hey, what do you know? Someone finally thought that Americans would pay to see the Joe Meek story on the small screen. For those who haven't heard of him (nearly everybody), Joe Meek was a forgotten legend of rock history--the most famous producer you've never heard of. Working in his home studio in the pre-Beatles 1960s, he wrote and produced a string of hits, misses, and completely berserk productions; the most famous single he wrote was the namesake of the film, ""Telstar"". It sold five million copies worldwide, was the first song by a British group to hit #1 in American, proved to the British Invasion bands that a great deal of money and fame awaited them in the States, and was named after a communications satellite.

The movie compresses the last six or seven years of Joe Meek's life into an hour and a half of frenetic activity, doomed romance (Meek was gay at a time when it was criminal to be a homosexual in Britain, whether or not one actually had sex with members of the same sex), strange music, occasional triumphs and longer and longer stretches of failure as the music world passed him by. I'm almost certainly a bigger fan of Meek than whoever's reading this; let me just say that the liberties taken with the truth and with the real story serve the film and make it a stronger work. The percussion track on ""Have I the Right?"", for example, was people stamping on the wooden stairs in Meek's flat in real life, not everyone in the cast playing drums. Does it matter? Not in the least. The script is strong, Con O'Neill is revelatory as Joe Meek, Kevin Spacey is nearly unrecognizable as Major Banks, the man footing the bill for all the pop singles Meek's working on, and the stream of musicians working as the house band all acquit themselves magnificently. The story jumps forward and backward in time during the last night of Joe Meek's life, giving the viewer a front row seat to his successes and failures as things spiral from bad to worse in the ""present"" of February 1967.

This film gets my highest possible recommendation for anyone with an interest in pop music. And thankfully, three years after it was released in the UK, there's a legitimate DVD release. I'm so happy I now have the option to watch the movie after paying the filmmakers.",1330300800,17,2278,4.608374384236453

No explanation was given as to why he felt this movie was NOT THAT GOOD. His comment left me wondering if he watched the entire movie? Perhaps he was not old enough or mature enough to understand the historical significance that was so excellently portrayed by such an amazing award winning cast!! As any actor will tell you, it is harder to play someone who actually existed than to play a fictional character. The true facts and timeline were extremely accurate. Sooo Mr. You Know Who You Are, I strongly suggest that in the future you limit your movie watching to Disney and sappy romantic comedies!! The reason you felt that it was NOT THAT GOOD is because more often than not REAL LIFE lived by REAL PEOPLE is NOT THAT GOOD!!!! Personally I prefer and enjoy learning about REAL LIFE!!!

Meeks was a record producer and songwriter in London as England was starting to swing in the early 60's and the film chronicles, in 90-odd minutes, the latter years of his life. The fact that so much is crammed into so relatively little time, as he goes from hit to hit, miss to miss, abject failure and madness makes no difference as do any inventions or stretches of the truth. The film whips along at breakneck speed and Con O'Neill's portrayal of this tortured soul is nothing short of brilliant.

5009309,5,B006OI0GUQ,"Although it left me feeling rather sad, I enjoyed this biopic of record producer, Joe Meek's tragic and muddled life. Well cast characters with Con O'Neill playing Meek himself. From the early days with John Layton, the film documents Meek's rise to fame. When Billy Fury's backing band, The Tornados, who recorded Telstar, had the biggest hit to come out of the shabby studio, all should have been rosy, but royalties were hard to come by and there was no money to pay the musicians. Things get even worse when a French composer accuses Meek of plagiarism and royalties are kept on hold, leaving Meek slipping further into debt. The  ill-fated affair with Heinz Burt, depression, drug addiction, all took their toll and led to murder and eventually suicide.

Lots of familiar faces appear in the cast, Kevin Spacey (Major Banks), Pam Ferris (the landlady) JJ Field ( Heinz Burt), James Corden (Clem Cattini) Ralf Little (Chaz Hodges).

Like a lot of Americans, I had never heard of Joe Meek, the prolific British record producer (yep, there were others than only George Martin). This is a great biopic of early days of rock and roll and you'll be amazed at how many great artists Meek worked with. O'Neill is phenomenal as Meek and makes a very unlikable person still be magnetic as a producer, and heartbreakingly flawed as a man. Feild goes all in as 60s pop star Heinz and has a brave form of chemistry with O'Neill. Corden is underused as Clem Cattini, but adds a depth of ""dramedy"" to the movie.

But making a melodrama out of what already is a real-life melodrama sends everything over the top.  The crying, the screaming, we get it.  And the meticulous attention to vintage details is undercut by expecting us to believe Kevin Spacey is an Englishman.

There is a slightly amusing thread about Meek's attempts to make a star out of Heinz Burt but even this is tinged with sadness and according to his Wikipedia entry, Heinz wasn't even gay which if true, makes for even less of story.

The performances are great.  Even Spacey, underneath that glued-on orange hair almost pulls it off, so to speak.  But it feels long, depressing and empty.  At the beginning, there's the creation of Telstar; at the end there's a rather amazing epilog about, among other things, Mitch Mitchell and Ritchie Blackmore.  But the middle?

The Telstar film...

What I Liked:

It was beautifully staged and acted. Great cast. They nailed the period. Joe Meek was a bit like Ed Wood, but more successful and accomplished. The real Meek was surrounded by a gaggle of eccentric collaborators and musicians. Some of the banter with musicians was good.

What I didn't like:

The film does NOT spend much time focusing on Meek's or his collaborators' artistic accomplishments (aside from a bit with Geoff Goddard), his innovative recording techniques and his rise through the recording industry. Telstar (the film) begins with his kitchen sink 304 Holloway Road studio and focuses on his decline, temper and his abusive personality.

Summary:

Joe Meek comes off as flippant, unlikeable, petty and foolish. Although he was clearly a complicated man, the film portrays him as a monster. Moran didn't make the audience care about Meek or his music, which sucks. Instead, Moran portrayed Joe Meek as a horrible man who made garbage.
