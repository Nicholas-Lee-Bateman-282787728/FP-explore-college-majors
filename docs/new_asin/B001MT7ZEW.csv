3698817,5,B001MT7ZEW,"A futuristic horror opera musical? that is just weird. I wasn't sure if I would really get into it or cringe with the cheese factor. Well, I ended up really getting into it. The film is executed perfectly in order to pull off the unique mix of genres going on. All of the cast were great choices..Personally I think the Graverobber steals the show. After seeing the movie, for the next several weeks I couldn't get the songs out of my head..it helped that I had the soundtrack too, but the songs are just infectious..and different. If you are open-minded this is an entertaining movie.

I am a little disgruntled that I don't think they are putting the deleted scenes on the DVD. The director commented that there were quite a few. I guess I won't know until the DVD arrives.",1230422400,,775,4.49645390070922
3698818,5,B001MT7ZEW,"It is a very sad thing that Repo! did not get a wide theater release. The music is very catchy, finding that multiple viewings guarantee you singing along.

They movie has gore, violence, humor, strange characters, love story, father-daughter relationship, revenge! It has everything you could want in a movie!

I for one am not a huge fan of musicals, I have only watched a couple in my life. But Repo! has struck a spot with me that will never go away (and I hope it really doesn't).

Get this movie for yourself or someone you love, it is worth it.",1230076800,5,551,4.435643564356436
3698819,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Three, count 'em, three (!) songs from Repo! The Genetic Opera are being considered for Academy Award nomination. That shows how amazing this film is. Sadly, Lionsgate does not consider this film to be all that amazing, and is not doing anything to support this nomination. Generally, a film company would send letters and sample DVDs to the Academy members, promoting their film. Lionsgate, however, is run by a bunch of idiots and they are not doing this. So, it is up to the fans to promote Repo! Here are the three songs that are up for the nomination:
""Zydrate Anatomy""
""Chase The Morning""
""Chromaggia""

Set against a futuristic backdrop where an epidemic of organ failures is plaguing humanity, people turn to the unscrupulous Geneco Corporation to purchase replacements for their failing vitals. Not everybody makes good on their payments, however, which is where Nathan Wallace (Anthony Head of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame) goes into action as one of Geneco's ""repo men"", brutally reclaiming defaulters organs at scalpel-point.

I loved it! It's basically a very stylized, horror rock opera. I was a little worried about Alexa Vega and Paris Hilton being lead characters in it, but Alexa Vega was marvelous, and Paris Hilton was basically being herself (an heiress to a multibillion-if-not-more-dollar company who's obsessed with fashion and thinks she's capable of singing), so she couldn't really go wrong. Her character didn't sing much either, so you don't really have to hear much of her voice. The songs are incredibly catchy and well written, and the actors had the voices that really brought the songs to life. Imo, the best songs are ""Zydrate Anatomy,"" ""Infected,"" and ""Legal Assassin."" There wasn't as much gore as expected, but the gore in the movie was great. Lots of someone being cut open and then the Repo Man reaching into his/her abdomen and taking various organs.

I've read/heard a lot of complaints about the film saying ""oh the story's too complex and weird!"" or ""the lyrics were awful and poorly written!"" You know what? The movie's called Repo! The Genetic Opera. ""Opera"" being the key word here. The melodrama and crazy story lines are a staple of classic operas! The story line is just like many classic opera story lines. I read someone's comment that the only opera aspect missing is a mistaken identity, which I find to be totally true. Weird lyrics are also a staple of classic operas. I mean, come on, they sing EVERYTHING in operas. Even ""oh no, I've dropped my hat"" gets turned into a ridiculously emotional song.

Overall, I loved this movie. The cast was great, the songs were great, and the style of the film was really interesting. I loved the nods to classic opera as well.

Final Verdict: 10/10",1229644800,4,2742,4.900862068965517

3698821,5,B001MT7ZEW,"That's a slightly facetious title, but let's face it, there's nothing quite like Repo! The Genetic Opera out there. Catchy show-tunes about unwanted surgery and illicit drug use? Check. Gorgeously realized dystopian cyberpunk setting? Check. Amazing performances by a ton of talented actors? Double-check. I especially loved Anthony Stewart Head's performance.

Look, I can't tell you if you're going to like Repo! If you're the sort of person who's always looking for something a little different, something really ""cutting edge"" (pardon the pun) and something that'll make everyone else wince a little when you describe the scene with the corpse-puppetry, well... Repo! is probably for you.",1229212800,15,692,5.528301886792453

3698828,5,B001MT7ZEW,"A very unique goth-style musical about the future where people's organs fail due to a culmination of all of our pollutants and bad habits and they have to get them replaced but must take out loans in order to do so. Before you stop reading, check this out: even if the story (which seems plausible) turns you off, this film offers a heck of a lot more. They brought together many talents of the music industry to make the music and back up vocals, the songs are very catchy and the whole movie is quite thought provoking. It deals with a possible futuristic plight of the every person, domestic politics, drug abuse, family difficulties and a wealthy family's abuse of power, and it does so in very elegant way for its genre. Between the intriguing story and concepts in the film, the talent pool they utilized to make this film and the catchy songs, I think this is an utterly fantastic movie that goes overlooked and prejudiced because there's constant singing, it has a gothic tone and it was made by Twisted Pictures who are known for the Saw films which people love to hate. If you can check your preconceptions at the door, give this movie a watch and see why I give it five stars.",1518566400,,1187,4.474654377880184

Starring Alexa PenaVega, Paul Sorvino, Anthony Head, Sarah Brightman, Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley, Kevin 'ohGr' Ogilvie and Terrance Zdunich. Great performance by everyone, Sarah Brightman was amazing with her bright eyes and her golden voice, I didn't know she was a singer until I checked her out on Wikipedia. I was surprised to see Paris Hilton in a movie like this, but she did a great job as well. And finally the actors who stole the show was none other than Bill Moseley and Kevin 'ohGr' Ogilvie.

3698842,4,B001MT7ZEW,"While watching, I couldn't help but wonder if the production team were high when they made this.

But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Extremely. Surprisingly. Seriously.

My first viewing, I stopped shy of 5 min because I couldn't help notice the campy tone, gore all over, and the cardboard looking production sets. This was not the type of musicals I was used to!!! [Repo!] clearly stand out by itself. Then I finished the movie upon my second viewing a few years later and I liked the movie!

The first 15 mins is hard to get into as the gore and the camp doesn't wait for you to play catch-up. Like a true rock musical, the movie will take off and does its thing. [Repo!] isn't sci-fi, not set in distant future, or anything realistic. You'll see plenty of nakedness, movie blood, movie guts, slasher violence akin to gore horror genre, sexual references; a thought-provoking satire on corporations, plastic surgery, human greed, human vanity, family love and hate, adolescence. Also goths, skimpy nurse outfits, lolitas, steampunk.  ...  This is a weird movie, lol.

The musical itself, the soundtrack, surprised me. If you love heavy metal, I am pretty sure you'll love [Repo!]'s soundtrack. It's high energy and kept me going with the ride with me doing air drums at the end. Honestly, the third act made me feel like I was in a concert.

I watched this with a friend, and I think [Repo!] is a type of movie that it's better to enjoy it with an audience. Just like a concert. We both liked it and had a great time. Genuine sincerity: what a hidden gem of a movie!",1511568000,,1563,4.600719424460432

3698899,3,B001MT7ZEW,"Okay, I'm only giving this three stars but not because it's bad per-say, it's just not my cup of tea for subject matter. I have a teenage niece though who absolutely adores this movie...she made me sit down and watch it with her, her mom (who is the same age as I am) also really likes it....so take that for what it's worth.

I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but this movie doesn't feel so much like a movie to me (not a bad thing), it feels more like a Broadway production, both in feel and scope. I will say the music is good, and it's more of a rock-opera than anything. The singing is also good...and I suppose I an admit that there was a slight bit of satisfaction in seeing Paris Hilton play the fake person she really is.

Would I recommend this movie? Honestly, not to everyone but to those who like something really dark and twisted...yeah, I'd probably recommend it. So, if you like dark and twisted, and don't mind people singing their lines...give it a shot, you may like it like my friends do. As for me, once was enough.",1480550400,,1045,4.2727272727272725

3698908,3,B001MT7ZEW,"This is the second time I've watched this and again, it was a huge let down. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film after all the hype and the general plot of it. This one however, I simply could not get into. The acting is okay, nothing to write home about. Even Sarah Brightman's performance was a bit of a let down and Paris Hilton's attempt at edginess ends up being exactly what you'd expect. The biggest personal offense however had to have been the music. There isn't a single genre I don't like. I can't stand ""I don't like _____ type of music"" people because I feel music itself is so broad so many different sounds can be so good. But this...no. Not for me. At all. The music was awful. Maybe it was deliberately written in cringe-worthy phrases and melodies the time signatures make me want to rip my hair out. Vega's voice is alright, Hilton's is crap BUT it suits the role. I give it three stars instead of two because the aesthetics. The costumes and style were pretty cool. All in all, view at your own risk.",1477699200,,1025,4.34375

My best musical so far are two movies <SWEENY TODD> and <SOUND OF MUSIC> And I cannot tell which one is better since they are so different.
Both has such a great moments that truely touched my soul. But this movie, it didn't.
It was a well done film, but nothing touched my soul.
It was like a well made music video all right but it was not like touching my inner soul.
There are some really well done moments and  I really admire that but some of the moments when they are talking and change into singing, it felt more like mismatched, It felt like the song came from nowhere, forcefully came out just because they have to sing.
The computer graphics are good and well done.
It took some time to understand each charactors since they are all brand new faces but they are all good.

3699136,3,B001MT7ZEW,"I have three major problems with this movie.  The first is that almost all of the songs in the first half of the movie are underwhelming, both for musical quality and the characters portrayed in them.  In particular, they TRY to rhyme, fail, and then completely abandon the effort at times (especially in the songs featuring Terrance Zdunich).  The writing for them just really felt lazy.  They do get significantly better.  ""Chase the Morning,"" despite the fact that the HEAVILY repeated title (it's half the chorus) is almost unrecognizable, making the song a bit confusing, is swimming in atmosphere and drama.  Alexa PenaVega (as Shilo) is absolutely wonderful in this scene.  Dialogue nestled inside a song can be awkward, but this is about as well-done as it can be, and her acting really carried the early part of the song.  She was joined in the song by Sarah Brightman, an excellent vocalist.  This wasn't the only good song, but it was definitely the first scene to really grab me, and the fact that it came so late in the movie is unfortunate.

The second problem is the tone of the movie.  Now, the tone is very much what this movie was sold on.  Between the semi-apocalyptic feel of the world and dark, modern music, the tone should be what draws the viewer in.  However, the style of dress for the background characters suggests nigh-Victorian modesty and conservatism OR wild, over-sexualized punk.  It's not a mix between the two.  Both styles and tones are present right next to each other and right after one another, with no effort to reconcile the two or address the contradiction.  In a related issue, many songs in Repo! are delivered as in-story performances, with old, conservatively dressed audience members watching an aggressive punk rock number and then a semi-classical opera performance, and seeming to feel the same about both performances.

The third problem is one scene.  Now, a LOT of scenes in this movie have problems, but this one is big for killing what should have been one of the most exciting moments of the movie, occurring near the end.  I won't give too many details (as the spoiler wouldn't be fair), but it begins with ""Let the Monster Rise,"" a chilling song that starts off slow and builds to absolute butt-kicking adrenaline.  This song is everything I wanted from this movie, and the song only runs a little over two minutes, wasting no time in the relationship turning point and building emotionally and musically.  Unsurprisingly, Alexa PenaVega is part of the performance, but Anthony Head owns this song.  It wasn't his only good performance in this movie, more on that later, but instead of a good performance trying to carry a poorly constructed scene/song, he finally got to appear in something worthy of his talents.  Wait?  Isn't this paragraph supposed to be about a scene that ruins my enjoyment of the movie?  I'm getting there.  I had to give you a bit of background, because the scene that kills it IMMEDIATELY follows this scene.  Again, no spoilers, but this song promises some action, a very specific action that the viewer has been kind of expecting for almost an hour at this point.  That promise is not fulfilled.  Instead, the next scene features a complete stop in action and drama, and not due to some unexpected development, either.  The character just f**king stops.  I don't know why.  But having struggled through so much to get to that heavily built up moment, and then seeing that moment die so...casually? really had me completely uninvested for what was supposed to be the final confrontation and reveal.

Okay, the good stuff:

So, like many, I only knew of Anthony Head as Rupert Giles from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.  I was not excited about seeing him in such a large role, and it is a large role, larger than I was expecting, in fact.  His acting was compelling, despite being hindered by awkward writing, his singing intense despite predictable tones.  He was absolutely amazing.

Alexa PenaVega has a major role in my two favorite songs, and it's not coincidence.  In both cases, I think her acting contributed more than her voice.  It's also probably not coincidence that both songs started with more dialogue, showcased her conflicted emotions at the time, and ended by just featuring a compelling voice (not hers) and dramatic moment.

Sarah Brightman didn't surprise me, but only because I knew that she could sing already.  One more quick complaint.  There is only ONE TIME in the whole movie where Anthony Head, Sarah Brightman, and Alexa PenaVega are in the same scene, and it's two minutes of awkward, musically-accompanied, half-sung dialogue.  How do you not capitalize on that and give them a real song together?  The two best voices in the whole movie, and they NEVER share a song together?  They couldn't even manage a cross-scene duet as both characters were building toward resolving their individual (yet overlapping) story arcs/motivations.  Not capitalizing on that was a failure.

Paris Hilton was actually a good casting.  It was a minor role, and she played a spoiled, selfish rich girl.  Yeah, not a stretch, but really, she did no damage to the quality of the film.

To sum up, this was not a waste of time.  The moments that were good were truly worthwhile, and I really hope this movie inspires someone to create something wonderful, because there are good things to take from it (like a solid integration of comic book style animation for transition and background).  Unfortunately, you'd get a lot more enjoyment by reading the plot summary and youtubing the songs above than by actually watching the movie.",1448668800,,5622,4.856992639327024

Unfortunately for all its promise,,,,star-studded cast, potentially brilliant premise, and what could be an arresting use of genre spanning visual artistry...Repo! The Genetic Opera simply never lives up to its potential.  All its elements are somehow handled with cement gloves when they could have been deftly woven into to something magnificent.  This movie gives TOO Much when it should gives less..as in CLICHES... and pulls back when it ought to Pour It ON...for example the bedroom rebellion scene with a punk rock motif featuring a totally wasted cameo by Joan Jett or Sarah Brightman's final scene which could have been epic and was a complete throw away musically, visually and plot-wise.  This movie cannot decide whether to be heavy on  a plot commenting and on modern society, genetics and corporate greed while  contrasting it with traditional Greek operatic tragic themes of family and betrayal using rock/goth music (which would be F'ing AWESOME)  or if it just wants to be a Tim Burton Flick with some Riddley Scott architecture and singing.  The plot references great, fascinating concepts and intriguing mysteries and then doesn't develop them or quickly resolves them i n a Scooby-Doo finish,  Character Develpment, in the form of key individuals ""story"", is quick and doesn't develop empathy or relationships between characters as it reveals more fact than  feeling, The only real nod to the Rocky Horror picture show is the lingerie and passing reference to perversion, The only homage to Blade runner is setting and unexplored father/maker betrayal that woul'd've make an Epic movie if explored even a tiny bit more  There is no real emphasis on any specific genre or music so if you are expecting to fing something to Love be it opera, goth, techno, or rock...you wont,  The visuals are impressive but forgettable.  The acting is decent but not at all memorable. Sarah Brightman's role and talent are so tragically unused here!! The graverobber is the best character honestly. I really wanted to like this movie.  I was waiting for the grand song or point to make it come together for me.  The ending was the most unclimactic event since...well, it let's just say the entire effort was dismal and disappointing.  And not in pleasant way like a  horribly dystopian future or a premature death.  .",1440547200,,2482,5.369509043927649

3699241,3,B001MT7ZEW,"When a film's a ""cult classic,"" that means that it bombed in theaters (if it even enjoyed a theatrical release), that the critics hated it, and/or that it probably belongs in the ""it's so bad, it's good"" bin.  These films are guilty pleasures because they would never even be considered for an Academy Award, let alone win one.  Do we care?  Hardly.  Enter The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Boondock Saints, and Repo! The Genetic Opera.

Repo!, helmed by the creators of Saw, is the personification of a dream experienced after falling asleep while listening to Rasputina.  Despite being produced in 2008, Repo!'s score sounds like it was composed by Orgy during the pinnacle of industrial music.  This is not a bad thing.  While some might consider the music here to be dated, I found it oddly refreshing.

Though, I must warn those not in the know that this is a rock opera - meaning that despite however ridiculous the practice may seem at times, everything here is sung and very few lines are spoken.  I'll never forget how disjointed I felt when I saw The Who's Tommy as a teen, followed by the dismissive ""Well, what did you expect from a rock opera?"" that was my mom's response.

So, for a bit of plot summary, Paul Sorvino is Rotti Largo, the kingpin of GeneCo.  GeneCo's shtick is that they lend you organs with the understanding that they will repossess their product if you can't make good on your payments.  (That's right; they kill ya.)  While some folks may use this service to replace, say, a bad kidney or a malfunctioning heart, others get addicted to the surgery in a commentary of sorts on plastic surgery.  They also can become addicted to the drug that knocks you out before the surgery - Zydrate.

This is where drug dealers/grave robbers get in on the fun by digging up the old corpses of those sorry sacks who couldn't pay their debts and stealing the Zydrate that apparently doesn't decompose within their rotted flesh.  The dealers/robbers then hawk their ""street Zydrate"" on the black market.

Anthony Stewart Head acts his ass off as Nathan Wallace.  Alexa Vega is Nathan's daughter, Shilo, a dystopian Rapunzel who's trapped in her father's ""tower"" when an inherited blood disease prohibits her from leaving her house.  The details on her condition are fuzzy, and with good reason.  But you'll find those out later.

Shilo has been led to believe that her father's occupation is quite the opposite of what he actually does: she thinks he's a doctor, saving people's lives.  Well, he does deal in organs...

I get that Shilo is a 17-year old girl, but Vega's voice is just too cutesy for this role.  Let's just say that I wasn't surprised to see that her role in the Spy Kids franchise is her most famous one.  My vote for her replacement?  Lzzy Hale from Halestorm.  The ""Seventeen"" number alone would have been infinitely more ballsy.

And, oh god, it is ever so irritating when she screams ""A LITTLE GLASS VIAL?!"" during ""Zydrate Anatomy.""  Yes, Shilo, I know you're sequestered and all, but it's not all that strange for liquids to come in little glass vials.  Now, if he had said he stuffed an organ in there, I might be better able to understand your horrified expression.

Nathan feels guilty for the death of his wife, Marni, after trying to cure an illness she contracted while pregnant that ended up killing her instead.  It is not confirmed whether or not this was the same disease that now plagues Shilo, but Shilo blames her mother for her shi**y genetics just the same.

While Marni is dying, Nathan is faced with the ""I can only save one"" choice, and because Shilo is here, we know which one that was.  Nathan's backstory, as well as several others in the film, are told via cell-shaded comic panels - a nice touch.

Back to Largo.  Largo is yet another character who is suffering from a disease, though his is even more vague and also terminal.  He knows he must leave GeneCo. to a successor when he kicks the bucket, but he rightfully considers his three useless kids to be far from contenders.  Then to whom shall he leave it?  Since there are few remaining characters to choose from, his selection is predictable.

Horror genre fave Bill Moseley (House of 1000 Corpses) plays Luigi Largo in what is arguably the most annoying role in the film.  Simply put, I wanted to throw a shoe at his face every time he opened his mouth.  Nivek Ogre, on the other hand, while another useless heir, is infinitely more enjoyable as Pavi Largo.  He wears a transplanted face throughout the entire film, though the former owner of that face may vary.

Paris Hilton plays Amber Sweet, the third of Largo's children, who opts to legally change her name for reasons unknown.  Amber is nothing more than a spoiled, whiny heiress, yet Hilton won a Razzie for her performance.  Just sit with that for a minute...

Hilton's only hit, ""Stars are Blind"" (which sounds like it was sung by Gwen Stefani), came out in 2006, two years prior to Repo!, so I don't know why anyone would think of Hilton as a worthy pop singer, let alone cast her in a rock opera.  The closest Hilton comes here to mimicking a rock musician is Courtney Love, and I sincerely doubt that Hole has her on speed-dial as an understudy.

Broadway darling Sarah Brightman plays Blind Mag, an opera singer that everyone loves who used to be blind (was it the name that gave it away?).  Now, Blind Mag is under GeneCo.'s thumb after signing a contract for new eyes that she didn't realize she had signed in blood.  Brightman's over-the-top make-up and false lashes are more showstopping than her numbers, though ""Chase the Morning"" is decent, in part due to Nancy Long stepping in vocally as Marni.

Terrance Zdunich is by far the most enjoyable character in the film as the Grave Robber who both narrates our tale and supplies Amber Sweet (and other Zydrate addicts) with the drug they so desperately crave.  (And, in Amber's case, he provides her with more than drugs.)  Zdunich also wrote, composed, directed, and produced Repo!, so it makes sense that he appears to know the material better than anyone else in the film.

As for the music, ""Zydrate Anatomy"" is Repo!'s ""Sweet Transvestite"" in that if you only had enough money to buy one song from the soundtrack, this one should be it, with ""Chase the Morning"" coming in at a close second.  And ""I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much,"" while clunky, is passable, though by this point in the film we're as bored as we are during Rocky Horror's ""Don't Dream It, Be It"" sequence.  Also, bonus points go out to casting for having Joan Jett pop up in a cameo for ""Seventeen.""

The first thing I wanted to do after seeing Repo! was to give the songs another listen to see if it was worth purchasing the full soundtrack.  I was bummed to see that the mp3 version is unavailable on Amazon (though both the standard and deluxe editions are available on iTunes), but I noticed that Matthew Kunka provides the ""most helpful"" review:

  ""Seriously, why are you even reading this review. Obviously you have seen this movie and love it. You find yourself singing Zydrate Anatomy in the shower. Just buy this CD. Seriously, stop reading, scroll up, press the Add To Cart button and buy this. Then listen to it. Heck, create a religion and worship it. Our children will be asking us about this movie one day. Show them the light....""

Thanks to Kunka, I realized that ""Zydrate Anatomy"" was, in fact, my favorite song here.  I also confirmed, after previewing the deluxe soundtrack on iTunes, that Repo! The Genetic Opera is best enjoyed like a Reese's peanut butter cup - whole.  Because eating jarred Reese's peanut butter is not nearly as good without the chocolate.",1435536000,,7693,4.6420118343195265

Think something like a mix between Rocky Horror and Sweeney Todd except that its an opera so the entire movie is sung instead of dialogue broken up by musical numbers. The cast was amazing and really made the movie. However I am in love with the soundtrack and listen to it often. If your looking of a dystopia sci-fi cult movie that quirky and dark that you should definitely watch this movie.

3699310,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo! The Genetic Opera is a very gruesome and gory musical with the theme of the repossession of organs. You have the opportunity to learn the back story of most of the characters through little snippets between the story. There is a story-teller in the movie that helps nudge some of the story along. Be prepared for a lot of dismembered body parts, blood, gore, violence, language, and slight nudity. This is rated R, I do not recommend it for children.

The musical numbers are something to get addicted to as well as disgust. Not all of the singers sound in rhythm since some of the songs are actually a melodic speaking with music following. Though personally I have fallen in love with all of the songs and memorized them as well. The melodies and mixed banter within songs are easily remembered.

I couldn't think of anyone better for the casting. I was skeptical to hear of Paris Hilton at first, but she knocked me to the floor - yes, even her vocals. Sarah Brightman gave me absolute cold chills.

Grave Robber and Blind Mag are my favorite characters and Zydrate Anatomy and Monster Rise are my favorite songs.

This has to be one of my top favorite movies because the story is remarkable and keeps you focused and interested. The singing doesn't always sound completely remarkable which makes it seem slightly more believable. The characters were cleverly made up with amazing back-stories that come to life only when the story calls for it in present time. It is a rather gruesome movie with many chilling and striking scenes and sexual undertones, or even others that are right in your face.

3699322,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Most people were a bit disappointed when they found out that this was an opera, because the trailer was so incredibly awesome it looked more like a demented super villian type movie. At least the trailer let on that kinda vibe. But the title is genetic opera.
Now what got me to see this is the fact it has Sarah Brightman, and Ogre. That showed me that this was going to be very unique. I figured it would be a heavy metal opera and I was right. But its much more than that. The subject matter is creapy at its deepest core. All the actors/singers should have gotten a Grammy and an academy award, especially Ogre. How can you not like ""Grave Robber.""
I saw this at a strange time in my life ( just got out of the marines and trying to ""fit in""). So it was no surprise that every prior service member I talked with had seen this movie. Like nobody in the mainstream had even heard of it. That told me this was a cult classic fenominon. I want to see this in bluray but probably never will based on its current"" rare"" status. Who wouldn't want to see a crispier Sarah Brightman in the TV eyes scene.
I guess this type film panders to the death metal opera gangs. If you love cradle of filth you might just like this.
Over seas your either rap or death metal. Haha I listened to LOG a lot. I wish I had this soundtrack in the outer rim of Iraq on Israeli borders. So fitting in that the grave Robber reminded me of the ""corpse men"" (sorry Navy). Paris Hilton singing grave robber whilst being clad in full body armor armed to the teeth patrolling a sea of dead bodies just makes me a little bit sad yet fitting.
Anyway that's some sick humor to take with ya. Great film, brings back ultra violent memories for sure. (If your prone to flashbacks then don't watch this as it infuses and encourages nightmares). Grave Robber gotta love him.",1426982400,,1836,4.263610315186247

I only watched it when it came on TV because I saw Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy) was in it and I decided to see how he would do in it, and I can say he can REALLY act and SING, especially when he's singing in a scary and menacing voice. *lol* I miss his singing voice already ever since I first heard it back in the Buffy musical.

MUSICALS:

Mind you, this isn't just a musical, it's an ""opera."" So between all the great songs, there are a lot of mediocre ones, where characters are just half-singing dialogue. But the soundtrack on the whole is fantastic. Catchy tunes with powerful, haunting instruments, combining the  elegance of a traditional musical with the charge of rock music. If you're curious, I highly recommend going to You Tube and looking up the song ""Zydrate Anatomy.""

I must also mention what a fantastic singing voice Terrance Zdunich has, as the narrator. Perhaps the one and only flaw of the movie is how underused he is.

CYBERPUNK:

(For those who don't know, ""cyberpunk"" is a type of science-fiction, things like ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix."") What does a cyberpunk fan take away from ""Repo!""? Nothing new, sci-fi wise; the cyberpunk elements here are pretty standard: a dark city with neon lights, evil corporations, deadly epidemics, and totalitarian governments.

What sets ""Repo"" apart from ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Ultraviolet,"" etc. is its characters. The protagonists are not hot action heroes, or talented young orphans waiting for destiny to tell them they're saviors of the human race; they're a father with a dark secret, and a teenage daughter with a crippling disease. Something about ""Repo"" really seems to call back to older, classic cyberpunk stories, like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Mona Lisa Overdrive."" This is also one of the few cyberpunk stories I know of where the most important female characters aren't ""sexy."" (Well, people with certain tastes no doubt find Blind Mag and Amber Sweet sexy, but you get my point.) This is a far more character-driven story than most cyberpunk books or movies you'll find, at least nowadays.

If you're also partial to the cyberpunk tropes of dark neon cities and campy goth/leather outfits, these things are also plentiful and creatively done.

HORROR:

Probably mediocre. I'm not big on horror, so I can't give a good review for this section. There is lots of blood and lots of gore, if you're into that. In terms of cover-your-eyes-terror though...not so much. It's not a suspense film or a horror movie. Just...a kind of creepy movie. With lots of blood and gore.

I'm purchasing this movie for myself ASAP. I'm a big fan of musicals and it quickly became one of my favorites.",1413849600,,2591,5.016317016317016

3699392,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Although I will freely admit that this isn't a movie for everyone, I myself find this movie to have its own brand of obscure brilliance. To me, this story is reminiscent of classic Greek tragedy in that for one, the more you watch it the more it makes sense, but also in many other ways. It has the same dramatic, gory elements that many Greek tragedies have, even down to a character gouging their eyes out. And much like tragedies and theatre of old, most of the characters save a few are seriously messed up people. There's even a sort of Greek chorus to be found in the character of the Grave-robber. I recommend this movie only to people who are willing to watch this movie closely as you would a piece of Greek theatre, like Medea or Antigone, or even a tragedy from Shakespeare. Be willing to put aside conventions of today's world and immerse yourself in the world of Repo! The Genetic Opera. If you let yourself, you will see the multitude of themes in this movie, the web of deceit and manipulation, and if anything else, you'll enjoy a kickass soundtrack.",1412467200,,1066,4.5

As a lover of horrible cinema, ""Repo"" ranks among my top favorites. It's right up there with ""Shock Treatment"" and ""Jersey Girl.""

Ha. Just kidding. Nobody likes ""Jersey Girl.""

I must say, anyone who looks to ""Phantom of the Opera"" as Sarah Brightman's defining work is a dullard and an imbecile because no star shines brighter than Blind Mag's, or at least Blind Mag's unexplained singing eye projection of a dead woman.

3699452,1,B001MT7ZEW,"Oh my goodness.  Thank the heavens for Netflix, because if I had purchased this blindly, I probably would have gone insane.

Honestly, what do people see in this?  The music - aka the focus of the film - is just flat-out bad.  The ""lyrics"" have zero flow to them most of the time, with the only exception to this being ""Zydrate Anatomy"", which actually sounds like a song and not people awkwardly singing dialogue and trying to make it sound musical.  Most of the backing music sounds like D-grade industrial rock by some band that desperately wants to be Nine Inch Nails, but doesn't possess nearly as much talent.  The costuming looks cheap.  Honestly, I feel like I could walk into any Hot Topic at any mall in America and buy everything these people are wearing.  Some of the singing is good (Sarah Brightman is pretty talented, obviously) but these people just aren't given anything decent to work with, so it's not all that enjoyable to listen to.  Paris Hilton gives a shockingly good performance, which just kind of weirds me out.  Her voice is far from fantastic, but it fits perfectly with the role she's playing here (which probably isn't that much of a stretch from the real Paris in the first pace) and it isn't all that horrible.

The worst singer in this entire movie is probably Alexa Vega.  She is off key through most of the film, and it's grating.  If you're going to make an opera, please make sure whoever is playing the main character can actually sing.  There's also that absolutely godawful psuedo-punk song ""Seventeen"", which made me cringe...a lot.  Speaking of, why does Joan Jett show up during that sequence?  Was she really that desperate for a paycheck?

I guess I can see why a fourteen year old emo kid would like this, but a full grown adult?  Well...if you like it because you view it as so bad it's good, I understand.  However, this is a largely inept film that doesn't warrant any of the attention that it gets and it's far from being anything worth watching.  Is it creative and unique?  Yes, but those two things don't automatically make something good, and this is far from good.  If you want a dark, horror-themed musical, why not check out ""Sweeney Todd""?  Both the Broadway version and Tim Burton adaption of it are fantastic, you can't really go wrong there.  While it isn't necessarily horror (despite its referencesto many things horror), there's also the classic film ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".  If you haven't seen those yet, do so and avoid this poorly constructed piece of junk like the plague.",1398124800,,2551,4.665919282511211

Repo! Is truly something special. A gothic symphonic-metal rock opera? Nothing has ever touched every single nerve in my brain so thoroughly as this movie has. Literally every character in this movie was cast perfectly, the acting is stellar, and the singing blew me the hell away. I even loved Paris's voice, because it fit her character. But all in all, two characters steal this movie completely - Anthony Stewart Head's Nathan Wallace, and Sarah Brightman's Blind Mag. Legal Assassin and Chromaggia are far and away the best numbers, which is saying something for a movie where all the music is amazing. The Opera Scene...I've never had goosebumps so strong before I'd watched that scene. Mag's gruesome final moments tie with the Opera Scene for best movie moment EVER in my opinion.

3699465,2,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo! is a film that has some great ideas, executes some pretty well, but overall has nothing interesting to withhold it the entire way through, thus causing a flashy play that does nothing more than ultimately bore the viewer who gets everything he/she needs to see within the first half hour. Repo! is told mostly as an ambitious rock opera featuring most scenes sung with background gothic-style rock music in the background. An interesting idea and one of the few things this has going for it.

Repo! has lots of things working against it in terms of just being an interesting story to watch unfold, except for its very ambitious and imaginative cinematography which brings us to a future world dsytopia where organ transplants are the new fad, and the #1 corporate provider being that of GeneCo, a company that has instilled a supposedly helpful payment plan so that ALL citizens wishing fashionable organ transplants (some for cosmetic reasons, but others replacing their own hearts? How this actually helps people be more fashionable is never actually revealed at all, and is just an excuse for some gore effects). Now when people aren't able to pay up or meet their end, GeneCo will send out Repo men who will retrieve the merchandise as quickly as possible; hence, killing its customers and opening them up to take back the organs. This is an excuse to make a more ""gory"" film yet ultimately disappoints pretty heavily in the gore department overall. Anyway, the film also presents how the ""black market""of its day digs up dead bodies and sells those GeneCo products to sell to people who can't afford the real thing. These both give us some seemingly great ideas for a movie really in the end never actually utilizes EITHER of them to give us anything interesting, which is beyond disappointing and head-scratchingly  questionable.

The Repo! cast consists of mostly no names but we do get a main role played by the guy ""Gyles"" from the 90s Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series. He plays a doctor and widower who has a teenage daughter suffering from a disease (which I forget) that threatens her life. His goal is to find a way to cure this illness yet is somehow intertwined with GeneCo in a forgettable matter which causes him to basically have trouble conjuring up this cure. The main CEO of GeneCo is also threatened with an illness he needs this same doctor to help him with as well.

What catches your eyes first will be the colors themselves;  a dazzling gothic art style chock full of some pretty amazing camera shots using different methods of blur and lighting. Any film student into the darker arts will absolutely take some great inspiration from Repo! as overall the film is just a beautiful thing to look at. Working as kind of an ""updated"" Rocky Horror Picture Show for the 21st century, the film creates a vividly dark atmosphere with some absolutely beautiful looking ideas. One of these being a showgirl who is blind and had what look like large jewels placed in here eye sockets; she almost resembles operatic pop singer Sarah Brightman in many ways, with abilities to sparkle and do all kinds of pretty effects. I would argue she alone steals the show, however little of it there is. Looking at her alone is just an absolutely pleasure; again, more beautiful visuals. It's just too bad Repo! has little to nothing to hold the viewer's interest beyond this single element.
Another plus would be the part of the head black market organ dealer, who has a very commanding and bombastic voice, and does a great job with his song portions. He is one of the few actors in Repo! that actually tries; sadly most either don't seem to care too much, or are plain simple bad actors.

The biggest setback that will be apparent to viewers is the part of the teenage daughter, who puts on a mostly mediocre acting job, with little passion or actual talent to play her part. Some parts work well but in the end it's obvious this was the daughter of a producer that just got the part through relation. This is obvious because other very small parts sprinkled throughout just show more enthusiasm than many of the bigger roles.
The biggest upset that Repo! commits must be that instead of sticking to a story having to do with the original template (a corporation that sells organs and sends repos to kill non-paying customers, and a black market that tries a loophole to make money) for a lame unoriginal story about a widower and his angst-ridden annoying daughter and their troubled relationship. Because this swap takes place, the film is nowhere near as gory or bloody as many horror and goth fanatics will be pleased with. Though the tone is dark, very little of the film is actually bloody. The creators were obviously just so obsessed with the visual medium and making thing look pretty, that they forgot to actually make an interesting movie. And that gives us our second biggest setback - a blandly told story.
Repo is simply a boring movie. The pace works fine but the combination of stale actors, a basic premise, and uninvolving characters make Repo! more of a hassle than it really should be. You really do want to like this movie, but simply can't due to these setbacks.
And lastly, the biggest negative for a rock opera musical, is the actual music. When a rock opera has mostly all boring stale songs, you know you're in trouble. Now, it's not all a fail, as some portions of the song beats do sound really fun and melodic, mostly the songs sung by the head black market dealer. Yet, the majority of the songs sound more like those skippable filler tracks you hear off a B-grade rock albums from the 1990s. You tread through them, and feel no real interest not only because they just aren't great songs, but even the actors don't seem to care as much as they should. Perhaps things would have worked better if they just didn't sing at all, or made most of the movie plain dialogue and not a musical at all.

Overall, I would only recommend Repo! if you are in the hankering for a visual treat, most especially those of the blind singer, yet through and through, the entire film is a pretty epic feat in visual cinematography. On that note, I did like it, but the hour and 40 minute music video feels about a whole hour too long, with an ending you just won't care to see at all. You may have seen this on sale at your local retailer for a few dollars, which is pretty much what it's worth, but do not pay any more than $7 or $8 for this one. You can definitely pass.",1394668800,,6494,4.612456747404845

In the movie people basically can get any new body part they want, even a new face and new eyes, but if you don't pay up, the repo man will show up and take them back. That's only part of it. There are (at least) two other stories- the girl that apparently has a genetic disorder that makes her have to stay inside, and the love triangle, murder and misplaced guilt.

Yeah, that bad, and Im a fan of spooky stuff myself, but this is goth like the Halloween isle at walmart is 'goth'... A bastard, failed attempt to adopt a sub-culture by obvious poseurs. Some kind of embarrassingly obvious attempt to create a new 'Rocky Horror' that falls on its face after slipping on all the fake blood.

3699552,4,B001MT7ZEW,"Obscene but 'good'
A definite work of art
While it is lackluster as musical due to how the vocals are written, weakness in the vocal songwriting and related sensibilities, it succeeds as a movie.
The vocal melodies and styling leave much to be desired. And the lyrics are often atrociously poor and clumsy in how they are styled. For reason like these alone, the critics hated the movie because it didn't fulfill they're preconceived ideas of what a musical should be.
But as a movie and an overall work of art the movie succeeds. The story is well expressed and a narrative mastery shows from the get go. The story, while relatively simple has a power to it and you can feel the passion the writers had for their idea.
To say the film is memorable is an understatement. It's weird, garish, coarse and gorily violent.
The villains in the movie are veritable fiends, as if straight from a particularly spirited comic book. Speaking of comic books, comic book sequences are used to great effect in the film's narration. It's well done.
The movie was engaging, well made and powerfully dramatic. Ultimately though, it is rather forgettable. There is no ultimate profound weight to the work, and for this reason, it's goes down to 3 1/2 stars in my book.
I have a penchant for the profound, the meaningful and for substance in art and this film does come short. It's ultimately frivolous. Entertaining and well done but frivolous none the less.",1375142400,,1440,4.718253968253968

This is the sort of move that becomes better with successive viewings. It pays to watch this film with intense focus. Much of the story's depth is left understated and it is up to the intelligent viewer to piece everything together.

The movie is a goth masterpiece whether they intended for it to be or not. My only complaint is that it seemed unfinished as if it was meant to be part of a set of movies. I recently saw an interview where the rights to any sequel are no longer in the hands of the movies creators so I guess it will remain unmade. That's too bad to because while I don't really have any complaints the unfinished feeling at the end is irksome.

3699596,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo!  The Genetic Opera is a cinematic adaption of the play by the same name. It is set in the not to distant future where the primary medical malady is organ failure. A company called Gene Co. stepped up to plate and began creating artificial organs to combat this. In true spirit of ultra-capitalism they began marketing these replacement organs as a fashion statement. Gene Co. also created a new very expensive highly addictive pain killer called Zydrate. A black market version of Zydrate is extracted from the dead and sold on the street. Meanwhile Gene Co. passed a bill through congress legalizing organ repossessions which apparently means their company doctor can hunt you down in the street, stab you to death and unceremoniously remove said organ to be placed into the next hapless victim only to be removed again when said person defaults on their payments.

  This movie follows the plight of Shilo Wallace (played by Alexa Vega) and her father Nathan Wallace (played by Anthony Stewart Head). Nathan Wallace is trying to find a cure for Shilo's blood disease.

  This film periodically has comic book interludes that can be bit distracting at times especially on your first viewing but do give a deeper insight into how individual characters story's overlap. This film is full of catchy musical numbers that tend to stay welcome in your head. My favorite character in this film is Blind Mag (played by Sarah Brightman) her voice is wonderful and she is a breath of fresh air. Or maybe I am a sucker for porcelain faced  goth girls with bionic eyes. All in all I found Repo! The Genetic Opera to be an excellent dark and broody goth opera even if a little cornball at times. This film gets extra points for having for having Paris Hilton's face fall off. I give this film four and a half monkeys.

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely worth seeing once, but to be honest at the hour-, hour-ten mark I was having to make an effort to focus on the video. What drew me in was getting to see Anthony Head but I was impressed by Alexa Vega's and (of course, now that I know who she is) Sarah Brightman's voices. I just wish they had been given better material to sing. I was surprised to find something with both Paul Sorvino and Paris Hilton in it - especially playing father and daughter. (And yes, that is Joan Jett.) All in all, the story is based on a good concept, unfortunately it's not executed that well. Mostly what falls flat are the characters, especially the Largo children - they are pointless and kind of stupid. Not enough is done with the Grave Robber.

If you're like me, and a Prime member, then definitely run the movie, otherwise, rent, don't buy - unless you're going to a convention and you think you can score Tony Head's autograph and you don't have a ""Music for Elevators"" CD or a Buffy pub shot.",1363478400,2,1062,4.363636363636363

3699628,4,B001MT7ZEW,"This movie is something we don't get much of anymore - a rock opera, a horror movie, and a comedy. Of course, it helps if you can find humor in robbing graves, taking organs from living people, and stitching new parts into folks.  Actually, the movie does have some funny moments,  great songs, and is entertaining for a rock opera. My favorite character is the character called GraveRobber, who loves his job so much when he starts singing, he gets louder and louder, and just barely escapes getting caught by the cops (graverobbing is illegal).  GraveRobber is also the most handsome and likeable man in the movie (go figure?).

The main character is a young girl named Shiloh. She is coming of age in a perverted nest of vipers and she is sick. She just wants to be a normal girl and the main story is a quest of Shiloh to be just an average teenager.  A subplot of the movie is a struggle for inheritance between the three deviants that are the adult childrens of the richest man in the country.  They will do anything to run their father's business of organ supply.

Several songs are from this rock opera that are used in backgrounds for horror youtubes or other productions, One is ""Let the Monster Rise"", one is ""At The Opera Tonight"" and more.  I also like the song ""21st Century Cure"" (sung by GraveRobber and ""Zydrate Anatomy"" and ""Mark It Up"" - dung by the evil trio of kids trying to get papa's business.

In summary, I liked the movie and the songs and the spcial effects, but I do enjoy horror movies - especially when horror is combined with comedy; I will, however, repeat my warning on the CD site,  this movie has very graphic violence, horror and sexual material.  I would not let someone under 17 watch this movie without their parent's approval.",1355529600,4,1767,4.5251572327044025

It wasn't long before both the movie and the soundtrack was ours.

And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery
And the Zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy
And when the gun goes off, it sparks, and you're ready for surgery

Anyone who enjoys musicals and gorror will be totally in love this film; the songs are pretty brilliant, the after-effects are orgasmtastic (as are the costumes). The only downside is that if you're NOT a fan of musicals or gorror, it might be hard to sit through. It definitely has a specific audience.

The story was interesting and captivating. There were multiple layers of character conflict which was very nice. The ending had a cool twist to it as well.
The only thing I think I didn't like was EVERY SINGLE LINE was sung. There is never a speaking moment. I think it makes it unique, but allowing some resting time where it's only talking, would have helped make a better flowing movie.
There were a lot of good songs and I think only one that I actually disliked...

Awesome movie. <3",1336089600,,228,4.428571428571429
3699655,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Can't quite remember how I first heard of this, but I'm very glad I did. And I know why it didn't hit theaters, it was WAY too original (mishmashing cult classic films like Saw, Moulin Rouge, Sweeney Todd, and even Rocky Horror Picture Show can be quite risky, but this did it effectively).
First, what I love most- interconnecting and interwtining backgrounds and stories that make one very complex (yet beautiful) story. Bloody violence for a very bloody time, an epidemic has wiped out much of the world's population, only for a cure to be demanded, and a ""savior"" has risen to the challenge... but the ""savior"" can't help his own dying self. And no one, at the moment, save his doctor, knows he's dying, which gives him opportunity to figure out who he's willing to give his fortunes to. Nah, not his bum children (why a trio of stooges like a necrophiliac rapist, high-time walking time bomb, and extrme drug addict?), no, it goes to the product of his late love, a beautiful teenager who looks precisely like his late love, except for one problem (make that two), a blood condition that she'll always need constant cure for, and her father (who basically stole his love's heart), a medical scientist haunted by a false belief that he accidentally killed his wife while she was giving birth. Okay, will's done, but the bum kids don't really have a clue of how to do anything properly, unlike the narrator of this morbidly hilarious tale, the Grave Robber (hands-down, the most original-and likable-narrator in an opera-style movie I've ever seen). A truly unique character, the Grave Robber also has an addiction, but not of taking a drug, but of stealing from the dead and manufacturing a cheap, street version of the world's known cure. And the girl's father? If a person purchases an organ and can't make due payment, they can't even run from him for their life, he's always got a way to get them, kill them, and take back what they had. No need to be gentle, either. Only, there's an added problem, that father is also the head honcho's personal assistant for this kind of task.
Confused yet? This story seems to be mostly about personal connections in very emotional ways. Lost pasts, unstable familiality, distrust between family, etc. And, like Shakespeare, it even bends and combines genres. Unlike Shakespeare, it also includes some of the best rock music and rock ballads, period. (I still can't listen to ""Chase the Morning"" without having my waterworks going crazy- in other words, I always end up crying during that song) So, is this movie worth watching? Let's see... it's the best-looking futuristic indie film I've seen to date, has disturbing/unique characters (some you hate, but most you can't help but love, in my case, Grave Robber, Pavi, and the scientist's daughter, Shilo Wallace [Alexa Vega did her role perfectly, I have to say, so did Terrance Zdunich as Grave Robber, which co-created the play/movie anyway]), and excellently well-made rock music throughout (it helps that Slipknot's ""The Clown"" helped with the drums for the soundtrack), yes, this was completely worth the time.
No, wait, scratch that, it's STILL worth it.
I'm not sure I can wait for The Devil's Carnival (for once, The Clown gets his debut movie role, not just working on the soundtrack, and ""Grave Robber"" gets to be the Devil).",1335398400,,3332,4.837127845884413
3699656,1,B001MT7ZEW,"Highlights first: Joan Jett's unexpected cameo was a sight for sore eyes (and ears) but I'd wager most people who like this movie didn't even know who that guitar playing woman was. It was also weird and didn't add anything to the scene, what was she doing there? The song was actually one of the few that weren't totally atrocious.
Sarah Brightman sang well.
The gore was actually a hoot but couldn't make up for the rest.
The premise isn't new but interesting. That's where it ends, though.

I generally enjoy watching incredibly movies, if just for their entertainment value (Plan 9 comes to mind), but I really struggled watching Repo.
Worst offenders: the horrible singing (mostly, Sarah Brightman unsurprisingly offers the only convincing vocal performance) and the tremendously bad lyrics. Telling a story with songs is hard. If you can't do it, don't do it. This film doesn't work as an opera. It would've been bad enough as a musical but actually having every single line sung is really pushing it when the lyrics are totally void of quality. The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Sweeney Todd are often erroneously compared to this film and they are prime examples of how to do it.
The constant layer of repetitive, generic ""gothic"" (ha) rock/metal/industrial/whatever doesn't help, neither does the fact that the vocals are disproportionately loud in the mix. There's only so much musical dysentery I can tolerate, so just 30 minutes in I was but wretchedly enduring it, hoping for the credits to roll soon.
There was no suspense at all and none of the characters where convincing enough to make me care for them.

Picture quality was good but the whole film looked too soft for my taste. The audio mix was rather bad, the lyrics (mixed to the center) nearly drowned out the music.

The makers of this movie tried to market this as ""cult"" from the start. It doesn't usually work this way but many people seem to be buying into it. Good for them, I guess.",1335312000,8,1961,4.744868035190616

Sometimes the lyrics get a little corny, other times it's just genius, the story line.
The plot is the true strength, at it's core this is a story about an over protective father and his daughter. The father lives a secret life as a Repoman, re-possessing organs when people fall behind in their payments.
Though highly futuristic Repo pokes fun at todays unhealthy superficial obsessions.

I listened to the soundtrack for weeks before i watched the movie and was severally dissapointed at first because some of the songs that i thought were fantastic turned out not to be in the movie. upon watching the movie with the directors commentary on i learned that they had to cut certain scenes to make the film a reasonable length.  However, i would absolutely love to see a directors cut of this movie in the future it would be worth every second to watch the scenes i had envisioned in my head!

so all in all this movie is soooo definetly worth the buy!!! it will be one you will watch over and over again! granted this movie isn't for everyone (but if you're on this page then this movie is probably for you) at the very least give this movie a shot you won't be dissapointed!",1332547200,,932,4.195530726256983

The only problem I had was actually GETTING the dvd. The last possible estimated date I was to get it, I checked the post office to find I had STILL not gotten the item. So I sent an email and about a day or two later I got a response saying they were sending me a new product and if the first DVD came to me, that I was to send it back to them.

I waited and in about a week I got the new DVD they sent me no problem. I never got the first DVD and was not charged shipping for them sending me the second DVD.

3699663,5,B001MT7ZEW,"When I first watched this movie, I had no clue what I was watching. It seemed to make no sense. Then I realized... wait! They're parodying today's health care industry! Don't pay your bills and we take back the way we fixed you. That is, we literally tear your guts out and kill you. Isn't that what we do? Help people until they run out of money and then throw them out of the hospital? Sometimes we never let them in the front door of the hospital in the first place. So we don't literally kill them or tear them apart but the end result is the same. They die. Or am I just overanalyzing the entire movie? Seeing how it's by the producer of ""Saw,"" which also had a message...

Anyway, how did I like it just as entertainment? I really enjoyed it. A little too bloody and gory for my personal taste but otherwise awesome. I loved the music. I would have liked to see Sarah Brightman have more than one song all to herself. I think she was the most famous singer in the cast so that was a shame... especially since I couldn't understand one word of the song she did sing! That song was very opera-like. She did get a second song in the credits though. But I guess it was Alexa Vega's movie, as most of the songs were hers. I like her a lot and she did a really nice job. I loved the colors... all the sets and scenery were so colorful. There was so much to look at. And giving the backstories in comic book format was interesting. It also helped make an otherwise complicated movie easier to understand. All of these things make this one of the most unique movies I have ever seen.",1329436800,,1581,4.2006578947368425
3699679,2,B001MT7ZEW,"I was really excited to see this movie, and I was incredibly let down. It was a great concept with miserably bad execution. The writing was awful, and the movie was full of so many scenes that should be cool, but somehow weren't cool at all. The majority of the singing was awkward and halfhearted and the music had virtually no musicality.

I give it one star for some impressive visuals, and one more just for ""Zydrate Anatomy"", which even I'll admit is pretty fantastic. There would be another half star for actually managing to make Paris Hilton look attractive, but it's cancelled out by that awful song ""Seventeen"" that would have been alright if it weren't so completely out of place in the movie.

3699680,5,B001MT7ZEW,"For me, Repo! was a movie that needed to be watched, thought about, and watched again about a month later to appreciate it. After my first viewing I was left entertained but sort of quieted by it, and then bits and pieces of the music got caught in my head and looped for weeks until I had to hunt down a copy and watch it again. The performances were memorable and unique, the music had a gothic, metal feel to it, and the tone is always bouncing between melodrama and dark comedic splatterfest, all told through song. Sarah Brightman is stunning in it, Ogre Nivek and Bill Moseley have brilliant chemistry together and even Paris Hilton won me over, which came as a surprise. But watching Anthony Stewart Head shifting back and forth from sullen doting father, to gleeful maniac was the highlight to me. I would absolutely suggest giving this a look, but understand you'll have the soundtrack running through your head for days.",1325548800,,930,4.642424242424243

3699684,1,B001MT7ZEW,"I had high hopes for this movie, given the glowing reviews here, and my general liking of weird horror films.  How could I resist a horror musical starring Paris Hilton and Paul Sorvino?  Well, I wish I would have.

For all the effort expended on production design - which is truly impressive - ""Repo"" manages to look more like a tarted-up ""Rocky Horror"" for the 21st century.  A horror sci-fi musical needs to be over the top rather than nonsensical, and in my view this movie falls much more in the nonsensical category.  20 minutes in, we're still not sure what the plot is, who is the protagonist, or really why half of the stuff in the movie is going on.  If there was a wave of organ failures, then why is cosmetic surgery so important in this world?  As much as I enjoy musicals, I found the songs in this movie, if you can call them that, grating.  The dialogue is sung, by and large, without resort to things like rhyming or structure.  Your tolerance for this will in large part determine how well you like ""Repo.""

I'm definitely in the minority here, but I have to recommend giving this a miss.",1322438400,6,1106,4.403940886699507

3699686,4,B001MT7ZEW,"I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to people who can take the gore, it shared directors with Saw. It's not constantly there, but it is there often. The plot is good for what it is, but it feels kind of like two stories in one and they weren't blended well. It's obvious what story is on screen most of the time and they don't collide too much until the end. The actors portray their parts well and the music was pretty good overall. I'd give it a seven out of ten.

Repo! The Genetic Opera follows the story of a love triangle. As the movie progresses further details about the death of the woman in said triangle are revealed. It is set in a bleak future where Gene-co, a body enhancement corporation, has pushed a bill through congress that allows for the repossession of organs. While this removes the need for an organ donor, if one can't, or wont, pay for their organ, they are cruelly slaughtered to repossess the organ.

The main character Shilo a sick young girl who can hardly leave her own house due to her illness. One night she decides to venture outside and ends up in the street hiding from police when the Repo Man shows up and saves her. The Repo man works for Gene-co who's CEO Rotti Largo is dying and in a round a bout manner Shilo ends up getting invited to the Opera at Gene-Co.

The Repo Man is a really messed up character. First off his job is to repossess organs. Second, in one scene he is shown disemboweling someone to take their organ, and then playing with their torso and head as if it's a hand puppet. The character is well portrayed and fits the story well, this is, however, less apparent at the beginning of the show.

Rotti Largo, as fate would have it, is sick and is dying. He has three children, but as is demonstrated in their musical number, all have serious character flaws. The song revolves around the three siblings arguing who will inherit the company, and how they are going to take it all for themselves leaving the other two with nothing. The first is Luigi, a man who clearly has anger issues. The Second is Pavi, who is a huge ladies man and wears other people's faces over his own. The Final sibling is Amber Sweet who is addicted to plastic surgery.

I'm tempted to say this movie is a musical, with slightly toned down musical numbers. The music is good and the image on the screen usually focuses on a couple characters, so while not large numbers, the expression and body language of the characters are clear. However one song, Shilo's solo number, felt really weird. She sang about being seventeen and that that changed everything, but really it was just her mad at her father, furthering the plot a small bit.

The movie is loose on filters; it says things how it wants to say it. And those with weak stomachs might want to stay away, while not constant, some scenes are disgusting, from the Repo Man playing with a corpse as if it's a puppet, to needles plunging into fresh corpses, and self-eye gouging, there are plenty of things I could have gone without, but they do enhance the feel of the movie. The Repo Man wouldn't appear nearly as sadistic without the corpse puppet.

It is explained Early on that Nathan, Shilo's father, stole the heart of Marni, the woman Rotti Largo loves, but ends up killing her. Nathan didn't mean to but as the movie progresses the story is told from different perspectives, revealing what really happened. Marni is dead when the movie begins, but she serves a vital character for the plot, the movie is largely about what happens between Nathan and Rotti after her death, but what really happened to her? Is Shilo's sickness related to what happened? Why did Rotti Largo personally invite Shilo to the opera? And just who is the Repo Man?",1318723200,,3740,4.483113069016153

3699720,4,B001MT7ZEW,"I saw this movie not too long on Netflix, a little skeptical about it at 1st.  I had rememberd seeing it on a shelf at a store and was kinda curious to see it, but was thinking it might be some kind of senseless bloody romp of some sort, though it looked to have a great cast...including Sarah Brightman and Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anthony Stewart Head (I loved him in that show!)  It also includes Paul Sorvino, who is pretty cool, and a grown up Spy Kids' Alexa Vega.  When I watched it, I was actually surprised by it.  The gore was very minimal, maybe a couple of scenes of it, and the rest of it was a well orchastrated musical, and most of the cast sang very well.  I wasn't worried about Anthony Steward Head, becasue I knew he could sing after a few episodes I'd seen of Buffy, especially the episode entitled One More Time With Feeling...a fully musical episode of the show.  Everyone was great though, or at least for what their roles were.  It's definitely Gothic, but definitely in a cool way.  All in all though, this is really not as bad as it might seem at a glance...it poses mainly as a cool and interesting musical, and not actually too bloody, like Repo Men, which deals with a similar premis.  (Repo Men isn't bad, but definitely not for those of a weaker constitution).  If you like musicals and aren't offended or grossed out by a small bit of gore, you should definitely check this out.

3699722,4,B001MT7ZEW,"When I first heard about Repo! The Genetic Opera, I was literally intrigued by how potenitally amazing it could be, being a fan of musicals and cult-horror films, I knew this would be my kind of movie, movies like sweeney todd, or Rocky Horror Picture show, even little shop of horrors. And even better it starred Anthony Stewart Head, and being a loyal fan to the television show, ""buffy the vampire slayer"", I knew at that point I couldn't avoid it. I was a little timid finding out that poparotsy queen, Paris Hilton starred in it, but I still gave it a chance like I do with most movies.
 When I first watched Repo The Genetic Opera I was a little thrown off, I was wondering what kind of movie I just bought, it wasn't the kind of movie I thought it was going to be. The biggest problem were the songs, I couldn't relate to them, the tunes were no where near as catchy as Rocky Horror Picture show. I also felt that the plot was weak which is a little sad because the concept of the movie I felt was amazing. The story takes place in the distant future, people are having organ failures and need to have replacements in order to live, which most of them cant afford it, so they rely on a company named Genco which provides the organs for those in need of them, the catch however is if they don't pay their bills on time for their newly implanted Genco organs, the Repo-man comes and takes their ""property"" back, by sergically removing them while they are still alive. If you ask me that is one hell of an orginal idea, the dull plot almost ruins it, not to say that there arn't great moments in the movie as well. Like the father and daughter relationship played by Head and Hiltion. I wasn't happy seeing this movie for the first time, it was probably the music which ruined it for me.
 I did however give it a second chance, feeling that I might of missed the message somewhere, and I must say, it does grow on you. First off, I am embarrassed to say this, but I didn't realize that the characters were pratically singing the entire time they spoke! Which means that Repo-Man The Genetic Opera isn't really a musical, its an Opera musical (hence the title), which explains why it gave off a different feeling than the usual musicals which I have seen in the past. The music also grew on me. Near the end of the movie, two of the characters are singing their hearts out about ""I didn't know how much I loved you, but I do"" while one of them lays dying in the others arms, and blood is covered across their entire body, its so horrific and emotional at the same time which is what I call classic horror, and is the high point in the movie. Other songs on the movie actually grew on me as well, if your expecting catchy pop tunes then you won't enjoy the music in Repo! But if you enjoy something different and experimental, then you may enjoy it after all, you have to like opera though. Anthony is of course the best singer I felt in the movie, if you've seen the buffy musical you know what I am talking about, however all the other actors were wonderful as well, even paris hilton, there were moments with her character which were a little ackward, but overall not bad. The scenery's are the best part of the movie, I don't even know how to describe it, some have compared it to blade runner. If you enjoy dark quirky humor, then you will enjoy the humor in here as well.
 Overall this is a wonderful cult movie for horror fans who want to see something different and orginal. If you want something like rocky horror picture show without the catchy music, then this is your movie.",1312588800,,3588,4.328380386329866

3699725,4,B001MT7ZEW,"I've always tried my absolute best to be one of the first to check out cult films. In fact, people come to me looking for recommendations or with queries as far as the cult cinema is concerned. Repo is one of the few films I've had the distinct pleasure of viewing this year which I wish I'd seen on the big screen. This is, by far, one of the greater films made in the past several years which truly deserves it's instant cult status & I'm hoping one of the theatres in my local town will do a midnight showing of this film sometime soon as simply watching the DVD is a flat-out insult to the makers.

Finally, the rock opera made it's grand return sadly to limited theatres in November 2008 of only seven theatres. The film took in $3,250 per screen on its opening day.  Repo also had a limited Canadian release, playing in Toronto from November 21-27, 2008. The DVD and Blu-ray were released January 20, 2009. To coincide with the film's release, Bousman, Smith, and Zdunich, as well as various cast members, did a touring version of the film. Because of strong ticket sales, a second and third touring session were added, in addition to a British tour across four locations. A Repo! Road Show was announced on January 28 in 10 cities. This show will be similar to the Repo! Road Tour, except it will be almost completely fan-run.

Set in the not so distant future 26 years after an epidemic of organ failures plagued the planet, a bio-tech company by the name of GeneCo emerged to provide organ transplants to the needy populace on a financial plan, making it affordable to anyone who needed one. Unfortunately, this seemingly wonderful finance plan is nothing at all like your standard car loan as those who miss their payments for 90 days are scheduled for repossession & hunted by villainous Repo Men. They do not call nor write if you miss your payments.

Repo! The Genetic Opera was undoubtedly compared to all the infamous rock operas such as Rocky Horror Picture Show or even Sweeney Todd with good reason. There are elements of each film which will ultimately remind viewers of many cult films we loved through the years but perhaps missed out on seeing in theatres.

Unlike many films being made which strain themselves for cult status, Repo seems to be content with staying true to it's dark & gritty nature with liberal doses of humor dispersed throughout.  Repo will likely strike the same nerve with it's core audience that Sweeney Todd struck with the demon barber who slits the throats of his patrons only to use their remains in  meat pies. The Genetic opera also cleverly takes a stab (no pun intended) at our worst fears concerning the health care system and gleefully manages to go all the way in the high gore department while still managing to make us gag & laugh.

Repo! is definitely not for all tastes. The lovers (fans of goth/industrial or cult films) will praise the film of course & try to attend any live events whereas the critics are going to hate it with a true passion. Either way, it's definitely an experience that needs to be had although probability suggests all the 'wannabe' good movies will continue to flood your multiplexes while films like Repo! will only be granted very limited releases.

It lacks cohesion all across the board, from casting to art directing to the songs themselves, all of which have such a vastly different feel that it's hard to believe anybody ever thought they worked together as an opera or a musical.  The lyrics are weak (with the exception of Zydrate Anatomy, the one and only number in an entire OPERA, for god's sake, that feels like somebody actually tried to make it good).  The music is bland, with one song unrelated to the next.  The score exists only to carry the extraordinarily weak dialogue, almost all of which is delivered in awful singing.  The self-conscious gothiness of the film comes across as silly and way overdone, like a greasy-haired girl in fishnet fingerless gloves and black lipstick hissing in the corner at the high-school Sadie Hawkins dance.

It's a miserable attempt at entertainment.

I hate the 'opera' nature of things.  See in a traditional opera everyone sings long songs to express complex emotions , they don't bicker in the singing.  You can't just sing regular dialogue (poorly written dialogue at that) and call it an opera.  Why not just make this a musical?  Have regular interaction punctuated by over the top musical numbers, it is an easier to construct style, and makes for an easier to compartmentalize soundtrack, songs people can recall and sing to themselves, rather than just awkward, stupid, melodramatic dialogue with some notes behind it.

I also dislike the over the top look of the film.  Yes the piles of bodies is a cool image (no spoiler it happens 10 minutes in), but there wasn't good build up, it's just there, no context, no discovery.  WEAK!

3699769,2,B001MT7ZEW,"REPO! has a very, very good trailer. If only REPO itself had a coherent concept and plot. Initial promo cited parallels to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE movies and stage musicals. The only similarities are the mention movies were outrageous flights of rock and roll taboo fantasies.

If only the music was engaging and/or memorable, with lyrics that weren't just
sung dialogue or narration. Acting is exaggerated without surprises while note
very efficiently moving along a plot. The plot is simple and adolescent; emotion
without thought.

From the makers of SAW with the same bloody pointless exploitation of vicious
carnage repeated again and again. The music has a steady, redundant beat, trite
characters represent one evil or sadism or another, over and over and on and on.

But REPO!'s graphics can't be faulted; maybe it would've been better to make it a mime to music presentation. The sung conversations were to me show stoppers; I cringed when the rhymes were forced out (a great many rhymes were near-misses.

Actually, my 'don't like it rating' over the 'hated it' was
jacked up a star just by the art direction and choreography.",1293235200,2,1170,4.984615384615385

Also, your love has to run more to the gritty classics like Rocky Horror Picture Show than the shiny new stuff like Moulan Rouge. If you feel the love, and have perhaps spent some time in the cybergoth, industrial music, or fetish worlds, Repo is something you will absolutely adore. There is defiantly an element of Grand Guignol style horror, so the gore could be a bit over the top for some. I however felt that it was perfectly balanced with the absurdest dystopic world of the film. Tony Head was as ever amazing. A particular standout was Terrance Zdunich as the narrator character Graverobber who, along with the three Largo children, the soprano Blind Mag and the overall tragic mode of the story are nods to traditional operatic staging that might be a little unfamiliar to rock opera fans. It is though a nice surprise and not awkward at all. You just have to pay attention to the information conveyed in the music to totally follow the plot.

  Paul Sorvino and Sarah Brightman are just amazing. Paul Sorvino can really wail out a mean vocal, and Sarah Brightman gives Boris Karloff a run for his money.
  i think the most disturbing thing, in this horror musical, is that Paris Hilton is actually really, really, good here. i always thought the airhead heiress was a standard celeb joke. not no more. she's obviously has a lot of talent that needs to be properly tapped into. her turn as as GeneCo heiress(i know ironic type casting)Amber Sweet is a knock out.

The actors chosen for this film were completely perfect for their roles: Nate's mood shifts are intense, teenage Shiloh was captured wonderfully, Rotti couldn't have been played by anyone else, and the accompanying music for the soundtrack is addictive! The only character that seemed to need a little dumbing-down for actor talent was Amber Sweet... but come on, we really can't expect THAT much from Paris, and besides, she was basically just acting as herself! :)

The plot is completely original, as are the characters, sounds and images from this film. It is very fun and comically gory with a few saddening twists thrown in the great social commentary.

3699841,5,B001MT7ZEW,"I am not a horror fan. In fact, I'm mildly creeped out by most gory films, and avoid them as much as possible.

That said, ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I think it will remain that way for a very long time.

An `operatic hack-em-up with heart' would be an okay, if shallow, label for this film. Or maybe `futuristic Sweeney Todd'. The latter, at least, would show how deeply artistic Repo! is. But there is something more, something innately beautiful and scary and tragic about this movie that allows it to transcend its gory premise to become something unique.

Essentially, the plotline begins about midway through the twenty-first century, after a terrible epidemic attacking vital organs kills millions. In this crisis, an organ transplant company, GeneCo, emerges to save the day, offering life-saving organs on an affordable monthly-payment system. But at some point, everyone falls into debt. And after ninety days, that debt is reclaimed by the GeneCo Repo Man, who does not particularly care about things like anaesthetics, or keeping his patients alive.

Enter Shilo, (Alexa Vega) heroine of the film and, unbeknownst to her, daughter of the Repo Man, (Anthony Stewart Head) a frightening, dual-personalitied, yet tragic figure. Shilo, kept inside all her seventeen years of life because of her blood disease, one day ventures outside -- and her life changes.

This film is beautifully stylized, beautifully performed, beautifully directed and written. All of the actors have excellent singing voices, which is good, because this opera has only a handful of spoken lines in it at all.

What really separates this movie from others of its kind, I think, is the depth of the characters and the human, emotional connection. For a story about repossessing organs, it is deeply moving, powerful, and in many parts, darkly hilarious. Highly recommended.",1273363200,2,1897,5.122977346278317
3699842,4,B001MT7ZEW,"""Repo: The Genetic Opera"" is based on the stage musical which was based on the book ""The Repossession Mambo"" by Eric Garcia which the newly released movie ""Repo Men"" is also based on. While the new movie embraces a ""Minority Report"" theme and fashions artificial organs, the musical sticks to an even grittier story with actual organs being traded and repossessed like hunks of bloody meat. Anthony Stewart Head plays Nathan, the Repo Man who works for GeneCo headed by Rotti Largo, played by Paul Sorvino. Nathan has a daughter with a blood condition, Shilo played by Alexa Vega that he keeps hidden away in a tower like Rapunzel. As Shilo seeks a cure to her condition and questions about her past, she is sucked into the GeneCo world as all answers will be found at the spectacular last performance of the Blind Mag at the Genetic Opera. Almost all the dialogue in this movie is sung.

What I really liked about this film was the way it was shot. It used an exposure filter that makes everything dark in a Tim Burton type of way and at times super glowy like a music video. It is a little blurry and hard to see sometimes, but it works in this story of a search for answers that take on increasing clarity and the focused perception lets you know what to notice. The home set reminds me of the Haunted Mansion at Disney World in its style and it has misty 3D portraits of Shilo's mother, Marni placed thoughtfully throughout as a constant reminder of her legacy to Shilo and the burdens left upon Nathan by her death.

Another really great stylistic choice was using comic panels to introduce and tell the back stories of characters. It feels like it is coming straight out of a graphic novel like ""Sin City"" and keeps the narrative straight with all these different characters jumping in and out. Each story contains and important secret and answer that adds to the culminating tension.

Anthony Stewart Head is mostly remembered for being Giles in the very popular ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series that once did a musical episode. His voice has rock edge and flavor to it unexpected from a man type cast as a librarian. He has to go back and forth between over-protectiveness to his daughter, guilt over her predicament, and hiding his contractual profession from her. When he dons his suit and goes into Repo Man mode, he brings a relish to his job that Jude Law and Forest Whitaker never had. In one scene, he removes a man's intenstines and proceeds to use him as a hand puppet during the song ""Thankless Job.""

Alexa Vega got most of her fame in kids' movies like the ""Spykids"" franchise. How she got from that to this is beyond me. As Shilo, she wears a black wig that makes her look like a young Morticia Addams or Winona Ryder. Shilo is the innocent in this story, a victim of her circumstances and a pawn in a larger game. She still tries to play Nancy Drew and make her own decisions, but acting out against her dad (the song ""Seventeen"") feels like a girl throwing a fit and dressing promiscuously to irritate him.

The most awkward casting job is of Paul Sorvino as Rotti Largo. What works well is his appearance looking like the head of the Italian mob to be the head of the evil corporation. His voice has a lot of vibrato and a good operatic tone when he gets into longer notes, but whenever he has lines of dialogue to speak-sing, it comes off really unnatural and funny. Being the main villain, I do not think we are supposed to be laughing at him quite so much.

While you might just hate the idea of Paris Hilton being in this movie (or any movie), there is no doubt that she is perfectly and ironically cast here. If it were 2056 and people were getting organs replaced for cosmetic reasons, this is exactly who Paris Hilton would be. Amber Sweet is daughter to Rotti Largo, head of GeneCo and is widely believed to be first in line to inherit the company since her brothers, Luigi (Bill Moseley) and Pavi (Nivek Ogre) are too annoyingly incompetent to even consider. Luigi has a short temper and is prone to killing his subordinates. Pavi has a weird facial fetish and is constantly replacing his face with new ones held in place with clamps looking like Greek theatrical masks.

Amber's flaw though, is an addiction to...surgery. The only way to ease her pain is to take a drug called Zydrate. Funny thing is she is supposed to be spokesperson for the Zydrate Support Network. Paris Hilton gets to dance in skimpy outfits and act like a loose, extremely bratty drug addict with a terrible singing voice which is why it works so well with her. Probably the funniest part of the film is when Amber attempts to sing at the Genetic Opera and her face falls off.

By far the coolest character in this film that made the movie memorable is the great Sarah Brightman who originated the character of Christine in ""Phantom of the Opera"". Here she plays Blind Mag, Shilo's mother's best friend who got new eyes from GeneCo and has been singing for them under contract as a spokesperson ever since. She wants to break her contract which compels Rotti to order Nathan to repossess her eyes as Repo Man. As soon as she gets on the scene, the movie gets more exciting. Her magic eyes start whirling around and create holograms. She is clearly the most vocally trained in the movie and most talented. Her performance at the Genetic Opera is the best singing in the film and it's a shame that her part isn't bigger.

The biggest surprise for me was finding out that Terrance Zdunich who plays the GraveRobber is also an Art Director on this film and many others and this was his first onscreen credit in a film. He handles it amazingly well considering the singing, particularly the screaming note of ""GRAVES!!!"" He looks like a vampire with a bit of Cabaret style to it. He also co-wrote the play and screenplay with Darren Smith.

This film has lots of B movie style cheap thrills with violence which you could expect from the director of three movies in the ""Saw"" franchise. There is lots of swearing and the film maintains an edgy rock vibe through most of it. If you like rock operas and/or B horror and the basic premise shared with ""Repo Men"", you would probably like this. Otherwise, this is not a movie for your parents or grandparents and is more of a cult hit than mainstream.",1270944000,2,6298,4.521510096575944

The premise was interesting, the stars were right, but it also sounded like something that could go incredibly wrong if it wasn't done correctly. For me at least, the film was a wonderful viewing experience.

The plot of the film follows several people in a post-apocalyptic future where a strange unexplainable phenomenon has caused millions of people to die of organ failure. Out of the tragedy, a company has been spawned: GeneCo- a company that makes organ transplants available to everyone. It doesn't stop with the sick- you can also get your otherwise fine body parts and organs replaced with ""designer"" organs. Can't pay? Expect to meet the Repo Man, the gruesome being who recollects GeneCo's ""property"". It's in the middle of all of this that young Shiloh, a girl with a blood disease that causes her to remain confined inside her room, is introduced.

I really enjoyed this film. I honestly wish I could have seen this in theaters when it was released- the colors and visuals in it are spectacular. The singing is pretty good as well- it's not perfect 100% of the movie, but you have to take into account that most of the time where the music ""suffers"" it is to prove how emotional the characters are at that moment.

I have to say, I think I've discovered a new favorite musical. Heck, I even loved Paris Hilton in her role- she was pretty perfect as Amber Sweet.

But I saw the preview for this and I blind-bought it (mostly because Anthony Stewart Head is in it and I love his acting). I liked it so much I went to a shadowcast of it in a local theater and had a blast. I'm not into things like ""Rocky Horror"" either, but Repo just has something to it that makes it stand out against most everything else. The cast is pitch perfect for their roles (even Paris Hilton, who seemingly does have some ""pipes""). I'd say that if you like rock operas, or if you liked the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, ""Once More with Feeling"" or perhaps even Sweeney Todd, (all of which, coincidentally, include Anthony Stewart Head in the cast), Repo is a safe bet.

As for the Bluray portion of this review, the audio is just right and for a lower budget film, it still shines on hi-def visually. It's not as polished and punchy as premier Bluray titles, but that's to be expected given the budget and look of the film.",1265846400,,1090,4.3431372549019605

The comic book style of narration is very cool, but on smaller televisions it doesn't work as well as it does on larger televisions. The cast itself is amazing, and the acting is excellent. The morbidity of the movie is off putting to some, but I find that it makes the world more compelling and more real. You have Zydrate junkies, surgery junkies, a product whose fine print means you can be killed/maimed if you can not keep up on the sizable payments, a corporation who seems to constantly peddle a 'better' you, and an overprotective father with secrets of his own. The songs are catchy, Zydrate Anatomy alone is hum-able for days, as well as an excellent vehicle to drive the plot.

The story is well written, and well thought out. It's not for the squeamish, but it is definitely well worth a watch (or ten).",1265673600,,964,4.440677966101695

I had just seen Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, and was looking for other kooky musicals to fall in love with, so when Repo! appeared in my mailbox, I was psyched.  It disappointed from the start, though I did try to give it the benefit of the doubt that it would pick up and be a bit more well written later in the movie.  It wasn't.  There were a couple of legitimately good songs in the movie, but for the most part I felt like i was watching something that was written as a standard movie, and then it was decided about halfway through production to turn it into a musical.  Most of the songs did not feel at all like songs--more like they were just pages of script that someone set to music without any edits.  The voices were all wonderful (well, the main character voices anyway).  Paris Hilton wasn't anywhere near as annoying as I expected her to be.  Anthony Stewart Head almost managed to salvage every one of his songs, though for most of the numbers he just couldn't pull off the impossible.  Anyway, I guess it was just a very thorough letdown.  The songs were very disappointing, and I felt like more money was spent on fake blood than on writing.

3699870,1,B001MT7ZEW,"When I heard about ""Repo!"" I thought the premise had promise, after all I love unique and surreal films, and unusual music. When I saw the cast included Sarah Brightman and Paul Sorvino I was sold (although I was deeply skeptical about the presence of Paris Hilton). The film starts with a comic book narrational device to explain that due to disease people's organs are failing the world over, but one evil company, GeneCo, run by Rotti Largo (Sorvino), has replacement organs available (""Don't worry, GeneCo offers organ financing."") The downside is that GeneCo also has organ repossessors that can repo you organs without warning or anesthesia. This, of course, gives the filmmakers great license to show geysers of gore, most of which is gratuitous to the plot and all of which goes out of the way to be as Sadistic as possible. (Watch for the especially loathsome worst ventriloquism scene ever, which, obviously, involves singing evisceration.)

The plot is a sadly predictable and largely centers on deception, cruelty, and revenge within the Rotti extended family, much like an ultra-graphic, murderous soap opera than anything written by Rossini, Donizetti, Mozart, or even Wagner. None of this should have surprised me, as later inspection revealed that the box proudly stated ""From the Producers of 'Saw'""; unfortunately I overlooked that key point when purchasing the DVD.

The biggest problems for me, beyond the gore, language, or depravity, were the music, pacing, and almost total lack of suspense. The movie is boring and utterly predictable; pacing and suspense are why some horror films are great with minimal onscreen violence and gore, while others aren't no matter how much splatter is shown. The film was interesting during the opening credits as the premise was unveiled; subsequent to that everything was an excuse to butcher while singing third-rate songs about even the most trivial plotpoints. There were, in fairness, a couple of songs that stood out from the rest and which were performed well, but the majority were rhyme and meter challenged to the extreme. Also to the film's credit, I thought the vocal performances were better than expected, despite the pretentious lyrics. The comic book motif as a linking devise was also tiresome: if you have to use animated title cards to make sense of the plot, there is normally a deeper problem, and that is certainly the case here.

I really wanted to like ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", as it has unique elements that had the potential to be a classic. Despite giving it a valiant effort, though, I found no redeeming value in the film, and audiences agreed. The film cost about $8.5 million to make and grossed less than $200,000 at the box office. Certainly DVD sales will enhance the earnings of the film, but I recommend highly that you don't.",1255219200,9,2821,4.997872340425532

Otherwise, stay far away from this amateurish, inept, brain dead bore.  Everything about this film fails so entirely that it is beyond description.  It has to be seen to be believed (but you will hate yourself for watching it if you have any sort of musical discrimination whatsoever).  I suppose it is meant to appeal to goth kids and vampire wannabes (are there really any of those left out there?) or perhaps the TWILIGHT crowd (and TWILIGHT is an infintely better movie than this insulting trash).  The film makes a tremendous effort to be edgy and shocking in EVERY scene but it never produced enough energy to be even mildy interesting.  It attempts to look slick and expensive like an alternative world version of MOULIN ROUGE but instead it looks cheap and sleazy.  The sets are pathetic, the CGI is laughable, costumes are insipid, uninspired and sensless. These costumes often look like something rejected for INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. There is simply no cohesive visual style in the film, making it a mish mash of every sci-fi, goth, vampire cliche you have ever seen.  AND IT'S A MUSICAL.  One thing a musical should have is at least ONE memorable tune.  Nothing here.  Every song is so generic sounding that it is impossible to remember two minutes after hearing it.  Huge chunks of dialogue are delivered in a pathetic immitation of operatic recitative that quickly becomes tedious.  This isn't good music on any level.  What on earth was Sarah Brightman thinking?  She must have hit rock bottom to waste her considerable talent in this shoddy puke inducing festival of pointless lunacy.  Run back to Sir Andrew quickly Sarah!

I don't mind shocking musicals at all.  SWEENY TOOD was far darker and had more gore than this, but it also had great music and incredible performances from all involved.  REEFER MADNESS also comes to mind as a great gory musical that had excellent music and also had a point to make.  What on earth is the point of REPO: THE GENETIC MUSICAL supposed to be?  What statement is it trying to make?  I think it must be ""Look how cool we are to be doing something so off the wall!""  Big deal.

I've wasted enough of my life on this rotten nonsense and I'm going to try and forget about it now (should be VERY easy to do).  I'll close this by saying that this movie is entirely without merit.  The music is awful, the direction is derivitive and unimaginative, the production design is cheap and ugly, the costumes are a joke, the editing is inept and the screenplay incomprehensible.  Rarely have I seen a film of any genre fail so completely in every aspect as REPO: THE GENETIC OPERA.

So the story is something that actually sounded rather ingenious, and something that someone who's into fringe sci-fi would find quite appealing, which of course, I did. My wife loves musicals, and rock for that matter, and so between the two of us, we'd thought that we'd found something that could appeal to the both of us. It had a reasonably good looking cast, and our local 'fringe' movie house had it playing and was sold out every time! All in all, it sounded better than it ended up being.

VIDEO QUALITY:

Who ever mastered this blu-ray did an excellent job, it's gorgeous, and the sound's pretty good too!!

You like rock operas, while it wasn't what we expected, and it's nothing that I'd suggest anyone ran out and bought, for the price, if you like this kind of movie, it's probably a good buy for you.

Although it sets the stage of being a very interesting story, it falls short with shallow characters and very poorly written songs. Apparently Repo! tries to be ""cool"" and current with today's ""rock"" generation, but it falls prey to being so ""cool"" that it becomes shallow instead. The level of acting couldn't be any lower, every character's difference is only tied to his or her background, which is not enough to make you feel attached to them, especially in an opera or musical. Character development is important in musicals and operas, and Repo! has none of this whatsoever. Scenery is pretty bad to say the least, it looks like someone just filmed it on an abandoned house they found, so I would say its step above YouTube quality.

CGI was cheaply flat/static with little depth or detail. Special effects - e.g. the plastic sheeting used in walk-in freezers; typical blood filled syn skin prosthetics.  Acting?

Take 'The Crow' and mix with equal parts 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and you have Repo! Everything in this movie makes you want to know the story of how it came to be.  Even the background characters are all different and vibrant looking, like they have their own stories to tell. The atmosphere is very animated and electric. Unlike most movies, where emphasis and thought are put into just the characters and the plot, this movie imagines a whole world of people, thoughts, and ideas that are all put there for a specific purpose. Nothing is in the movie without a reason for being there. That's just the movie, now for the musical/rock opera portion. The music is absolutely great! I've seen plenty of Broadway musicals, and spent a great deal of time in the theatre. And this is a breath of fresh air compared to the normal and boring things that have been coming out in most recent years. The actors can all sing well, but you can't expect long winded songs. This is a Rock Opera, meaning the music will be very contemporary and have a heavy rock feel to them.  The best voices in the movie are Anthony Stewart Head, who has such a powerful and emotional voice. And Sarah Brightman, who brings out the old school opera feel, but with gothic overtones. I recommend this movie to people who like indie films, people who like musicals or theatre, and people who are tired of ""Hollywood"" making remakes of remakes of remakes. This is something very different and should be commended for it. This will not be for the ""general public"", but if you're a fan of cult classics, you'll love this movie.

I hated the plot, which was predictably comfortable at best, banal at worst, and the characterisation, which was painfully 2D and made it hard to enjoy and empathise with Nate, Shilo, and the Largo family, who were an otherwise interesting cast.

Out of the entire movie, the longest shot was 26 seconds.  It didn't stay on anyone long enough to capture their emotions. My other problem is with the girl playing Shilo.  She can sing but was made to sing a little flat the entire movie for the sake of sounding punkish. Her part would've been so much better. A notable performance in this is that of Anthony Steward Head. He switches completely between his two personalities flawlessly.",1242518400,,579,4.601941747572815

3699895,5,B001MT7ZEW,"While sitting bored one day, this movie was recommended to me to watch. I watched it thinking that it was going to be boring and something to just kill time with. After watching it though, I quickly changed my mind. Giles from BTVS has the title role of the repo man, Paris Hilton plays the part of a plastic surgery addicted junkie, (reflecting reality?), and assorted other actors help to round out the movie. Lot's of singing, not bad, some of them though, not extremely good, extreme amounts of obvious fake blood. Good story line.
I would have to say though, even though I was an avid fan of the Once More With Feeling episode of BTVS, the only reason I was able to spend 2 hours listening to Giles, (Anthony Head), was because his daughter had a better voice, and the character Blind Meg.
Blind Meg should have been an actual singer. Her voice is unlike anything I've heard in a long time. She seems to sing with a feeling for all of the songs as if they are a part of her, as if she has lived the events that make the songs what they are. When she sings, it's as if she isn't an actress in a movie, but actually telling you how she feels. Acting in a movie like that is no longer run of the mill, but instead, hard to find. Blind Meg sets the movie apart for me by herself.
Anthony Head also plays his part well, but not what one might be used to seeing on BTVS. I know it seems that I compare his performance alot to BTVS, but it's the only other thing I know he played in, and it was a better performance, even if he did have 7 years to perfect it.
The coolest part though, would have to be when Paris Hilton's face slides off, (sorry, spoiler), but as superficial as she is on her reality show, one couldn't really expect her in a movie with a serious part.
All in all though, the movie was good, definately not a waste of time, and worth spending the money on.",1241481600,,1871,4.185595567867036

The story is interesting, and I'd say this is something to see just to have an opinion on it. I don't think you have to be a goth kid to like it. I'm certainly not. Maybe around Halloween would be a good time to introduce yourself to it if you need some extra flavor.",1240012800,,493,3.93

*  ****WARNING  SPOILER  ALERT****  *
______________________________________________________________________
""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", is an excellent horror film in the musical format of an opera! Many people will try to compare this to the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in the same way non-Epicureans will describe new food encounters by saying ""it tastes like chicken."" When everybody knows that even turkey doesn't taste like chicken. But due to inexperience, we have nothing else to compare it to.
This is not a movie you would want to watch with the children. The violence is not implied, It is very graphic, with copious quantities of blood and gore. There are also scenes of partial frontal nudity and in certain scenes the lyrics are unrestrained and contain the F-bomb, but not to a gratuitous level.
The musical score is an excellent heavy metal cornucopia, with throbbing bass lines and virtuoso guitar leads. The acting comes through on a professional level; in spite of any preconceived notions you may have about Paris Hilton's abilities.
The costumes are excellent and effective in communicating the somber mood of the movie.
The set and setting of the movie are in the future and parallels today's mortgage banking quagmire. Say, you go to the hospital to have a life-saving procedure performed, a kidney, heart, liver or lung Transplant. And the surgery company's (GENECO) high-pressure sales staff talks you into some expensive upgrades(facelift, breast augmentation, liposuction, tummy tuck, etc...) all on credit. But don't worry you'll be able to afford it because, now you are ""one of the beautiful people"".
As an added assurance they give you a presurgery drug that GENECO developed (suppoedly to simplify the surgery) called ZYDRATE. It is actually a highly addictive patented compound extracted from dead humans. GENECO has used its considerable political clout to make it illegal for any non-surgery purpose. In reality it is used to make people keep coming back to get more surgery just to get the drug (and a vicious cycle begins).
But whatever you do, don't miss a single payment, or the surgery company GENECO will send out their collection agents to perform a ""repo"". But at that point they are no longer interested in your money. They want to collect(repossess)the anatomy parts that you purchased. And they are licensed to do it anywhere they find you, in the streets, in a dark alley, at a restaurant, in your bed or at the theater. During this surgery there are no drugs of any kind. There's just you the repoman and a scalpel.

Sure like a lot of rock operas, the majority of lyrics make little sense as a song because they are ment to convey the dialouge of the film but the music that accompany those lyrics is excellent.
What is really surprising is the cast and sets. They seem to preform their roles well. The cast amazed me by their singing talents for the most part. They seem to make the roles their own. Sets were done on a shoestring budget but look a lot more elaberate than most would expect.
This film was a labor of love for the two creators and unlike most films looked at like this, they pulled it off where it would be entertaining.
Set roughly 50 years in the future, organ replacements have become a fashion statement. They can be financed like you would a home or car. And like anything financed, if you miss your payments, they become subject for reposession. The company responsible for providing these financed organs is GeneCo owned by the Largo family. However the head of that Largo family is dying and feels his children are not suitable to inherit his company.
Enter Shilo Wallace, a young 17 year-old girl who has a blood disease and her doctor father, Nathan. Nathan has cared for Shilo since birth, after her mother passed away in child birth. However Nathan has a few dark secrets he is keeping from Shilo. The biggest is that his real job is the feared Repoman for GeneCo.
Then there is Blind Mag, a gifted singer who is known as the voice of GeneCo. She wants out of her contract with GeneCo however there is a high price for her to pay if she leaves. One that can cost her everything.
Find out how the tapsetry of these people's lives weave together with the final threads being sown together at the Genetic Opera.

Its not a great film, but its not aiming for that.  its different, the songs are catchy, its a little violent and its a little weird.  I love that me and my friends can put this on and sing along (keep in mind we're talking 20 year old straight men).  It is for mature/immature audiences.

If you miss payments, the company will ""repo"" your organs.  This all plays out in an opera-esque format with everyone dressed in psuedo-goth attire via a 17 year old emo girl who plays the lead role.  The worst part about the film is that the lead actress seems to be the worst vocalist in the movie.  At times, the other characters (such as her father) are singing (a conversation) and she seems to do little more than say her lines.

3699913,5,B001MT7ZEW,"During a time when it seems like there are no new ideas for movies and the film industry is filled with remakes, sequels, and adaptations, REPO! The Genetic Opera is a welcome breath of fresh air. Though it is, techically, an adaptation of what started as a 10 minute two person opera, it has evolved into a brilliantly original film. The movie is a full fledged rock-opera with hardly a word of unsung dialogue. And don't let that put you off. This movie, while admittedly not for everyone, is a masterpiece of music, visuals, and wonderful actors and does have at least a little something for almost everyone. It is gothic, it has music, it is dark and twisted and has some gore, it has a touching story of a father's love for his daughter, it has comedy. It flows rather fluidly for the ammount of story being told and has a wonderfully diverse cast ranging from opera singer sarah brightman, to child actress Alexa Vega, to rock musician Ogre, to classicly trained actor Anthony Head, even to heiress Paris Hilton (who does a surprisingly good job with her character) The music is catchy, The story is original, the visuals are dark and astounding.

The movie is set in the year 2057 during an epidemic of massive organ failures. Thanks to GeneCo people could finance organ transplants, but failure to pay means a visit from the Repo Man, the legal assain. The story is that of Shilo (Alexa Vega of Spy Kids), a 17 year old girl with a rare blood disease who is kept locked in the house by her over-protective father, Nathan Wallce (Anthony Stewart Head from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) so that she doesn't have to face the cruel world that lies outside her window. Little does she know that he is also GeneCo's head Repo Man. The complex story line emerges as GeneCo's founder Rotti Largo (Paul Sorvino) discovers that he is dying and needs to find a worthy heir to inherit the company since he deems his own children, Pavi (Ogre of Skinny Puppy), Luigi (Bill Mosely), and Amber Sweet (Paris Hilton) unworthy of his legacy. To top things off, Blind Mag (Sarah Brightman), The leading Opera singer of the day, has decided that she cannot go on supporting a company that she does not believe in and decides to leave the genetic opera, much to geneco's dismay. But, a clause in her contract reads that if she leaves GeneCo she forfeits her eyes. Its a beautiful struggle for Shilo to finally break free of her father and try to save her hero Mag all while discovering the horrible truth about her father and herself. Throughout the events of this one night of discovery the character of Graverobber (co-creator Terrance Zdunich) narrates the story with wit and also has one of the most catchy and memorable songs in the whole movie.",1235865600,2,2732,4.621399176954733

I thought the whole production was well done and engaging. Everyone (including Paris Hilton) did a good job with the singing and the acting, though I wish Sarah Brightman had a bigger role. I think it compares very favorably to Rocky Horror in terms of being a rock musical. Oh! I should mention that it's not for everyone though. Not at all.

I find Sarah charming and strange and ethereal and here she all but chews the scenery - it's a great performance from a performer who rarely (if ever) does film roles. She understood her role and the material and had a point-of-view - would that all the film could have reached that mark. Stupid, witless, poor, amateur lyrics and an even more egregious script makes this thing a monumental waste of time and a complete bore.

Anthony Head wasted his time - why? - did you see his OTHERWISE ENGAGED in London? The man can captivate a theatre of 1000 individuals - hold them rapt - here he is simply slumming - and don't get me started about Paul Sorvino. He should have known better! Period! The images are horrible and excessive - witless and idiotic - displaying no craft, no intelligence. It's all DARK with no HUMOR! Even the make-up is wrong-headed and poorly wrought.

3699921,5,B001MT7ZEW,"As a fan of musicals and creepy things, I figured Repo! The Genetic Opera was right up my alley. It is a very addictive movie. I wish I had been able to see it in theaters, but I listened to the soundtrack months before the DVD release and was hooked. However, I must warn you that it's not for everyone. You have to either have a very open mind or have very specific interests in order to like it. I highly recommend you give it a chance, and probably two because it could take some getting used to. I urge you to not listen to harsh reviews!!!

That said, Repo! is very original, and created by people who really cared about and put tons of effort into the project. The imagery is marvelous and well done (I'm sure it looked amazing on the big screen), and the casting is spot on as well (Paul Sorvino and Sarah Brightman especially! Such powerful characters). The story is very fast-paced, a plus, and one thing that I found especially appealing was that the gore wasn't particularly gratuitous to a pointless degree. And the music! The music is a mix of many different styles, but mainly industrial. It's hard to pick favorites off the soundtrack, but as far as the movie sequences go ""Things You See in a Graveyard,"" ""Thankless Job,"" ""Chase the Morning,"" and ""Chromaggia"" are among the top for me.

My only lament is that I wish the DVD had as many features as the Blu-ray version. Other than that, this is a great addition to your cult/horror/musical collection.",1235606400,,1468,4.49438202247191
3699922,3,B001MT7ZEW,"(This review is for individuals who are unfamiliar with REPO!, and are approaching it for the first time.  Just thought I'd get that out of the way.)

Set in the proverbial ""not too distant future,"" REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA tells the saga of Shilo Wallace, whose father Nathan is the Repo Man.  What does the Repo Man do?  Well, he's something like the boogeyman; if you've got an organ from organ-making company Geneco (and you do, everyone does), then the Repo Man is the individual they send out if you don't make your payments.  And trust me, you don't want to miss a payment.  'Cause the Repo Man likes his job, and he's just looking for an excuse to take back your kidneys...

I know there's a whole cult thing behind REPO; a friend of mine is a big fan.  He's the reason I watched the film.  I'm not too keen on rock operas, but I do love a good horror story, and REPO has a killer one.  It's timely and gory, a great combination.  The story itself is fantastic; the humor is sharp and even subtle at times.  The acting here is pretty good for the most part (Anthony Head steals every scene as the titular character, and Alexa Vega is pretty good as his daughter), though Paris Hilton really shouldn't have been cast; I'm not saying that to jump on the ""bash Paris"" bandwagon, I mean she seriously cannot act.  Or sing.  It's rather confusing why she's in a rock opera in the first place.

Sure, some of the songs aren't very clever; some of them ARE good (real good), and they more than make up for the ones that lag behind.  And sure, certain things are cliched, and certain people (ahem! Paris) can't act worth a crap.  What really gets me about the film is the direction.  Many--dare I say most?--scenes are shot like an extended music video.  One scene between Shilo and her father, that takes place in her bedroom, reminds me of too many Lindsay Lohan videos.  The film deserves to be shot as a film; or, barring that, a stage musical.  There's a great story here, and some pretty good acting (Head is worth the price of admission alone), but the way it's shot and cut is just damned frustrating, and that's a shame.

Of course, all this is said with a caveat: If you're a cult fan of the tale, then you won't give a damn.  And you shouldn't.  I'm sure this will satisfy you.",1235520000,2,2287,4.3649289099526065
3699923,5,B001MT7ZEW,"The movie starts a tad sluggish, but it was important to set the background and character motivations. The ending moved me. Anthony Head played the character of Nathan amazingly and showed not only his skills as a singer, but really his flexibility as an actor. Repo followed all the elements of a traditional musical or opera, but with a dark and gory futuristic world. The story in Repo captivates and leaves you routing for your favorite character.

I fell in love and pre-ordered it the very next day along with the sound track. Well I am sure of this with all the talent in it even Paris can shine.  Personally I think she found her nitch, sure she was essentially playing herself.  Anthony surprised me again he's ability to change character was awesome.

3699930,4,B001MT7ZEW,"Finally!
After only managing only a slight theatrical release with little or no money being spent on advertising general audiences are finally getting a chance to check out this exciting rock opera and it was certainly worth the wait.

Slightly grown up Spy Kid Alexa Vega stars as Shilo.  She is a rather frail young girl whose delicate immune system keeps her trapped indoors.  Thankfully she has a loving, doting doctor father played by Buffy's mentor Anthony Stewart Head who tries to protect her from a world which could kill her.  But Dad's secret side job, repossessing organs from people who have fallen behind in their payments could lead to everything falling apart.

Sure the premise is rather silly but the movie has a interesting look and the novelty of little to no spoken dialogue.  Everything in the movie is sung by the cast that does an excellent job of handling both the drama and the musical numbers.  Head, Vega and the brilliant Sarah Brightman excel in their roles but the biggest surprise is that Paris Hilton does not bring the film crashing to the ground.  When I saw her name, I automatically feared the worst but she actually does a solid job.

The film does get a little gruesome at times but that should not come as too much of a surprise considering that it's directed by the man who has guided the Saw franchise from episodes 2 thru 4.  The gore gives the movie a surreal touch that works nicely with the musical numbers.

Although not a masterpiece this film fits in quite well on your DVD shelf with such titles as 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', 'Little Shop of Horrors' and 'Shock Treatment'.  If you have heard about Repo and are interested than you will probably enjoy it.",1235174400,,1707,4.653333333333333

So I googled it and saw Paris Hilton.  Not so intrigued any longer.  Yes, I was shallow enough and biased enough to write off a show because she's in it.  But, my husband was out movie browsing and ran across a blu-ray copy.  He snagged it and triumphantly brought it home for our viewing pleasure.  I wasn't expecting much.  How good could it really be?  In a word: spectacular.  First of all:  Sarah Brightman.  Extraordinary musical talent!  The Christine Daae to define Christine Daae.  Anthony Steward Head:  I was blown away by his depiction of Repo Man.  His split vocals to portray different aspects of his character's personality was an excellent touch.  And, like another reviewer, I didn't even recognize Paris Hilton's character until extremely late in the film.

The best way I can describe Repo! is an amalgamation of Rocky Horror Picture Show, Sweeney Todd and Phantom of the Opera.  It's darkly sexy, comical, and full of sarcasm and irony.  If you have a quirky or dark sense of humor, I am sure you'll find yourself giggling at the various antics of the performers.  Some of the songs gave me goosebumps due to their dark haunted tenor and the skill with which they were sung.  Others hand me tapping my toes, and others still (Zydrate Anatomy anyone?) were stuck in my head for days.

3699940,2,B001MT7ZEW,"Being a fan of campy musicals, such as Rocky Horror and Shock Treatment, I was thoroughly excited when I heard the premise for this film (and the fact that it had Sarah Brightman!). The film as a whole, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment. The premise surrounds a futuristic society plagued by infection and organ failure, run by a company that sells organs for a price. The catch is that if you can't pay off the organ you bought, the repo man comes to take it back.

Too bad the that's not really what the movie is about. The film centers around a rebellious 17 year old girl, whose father happens to be the repo man, but that's really just a plot device and has little to do with the intended story.

The film is lavishly based off of Blade Runner and Rocky Horror without the charm or the catchy tunes. The music in this movie is not worthy to bear the name ""rock opera"" or even musical. There are one or two catchy songs, but I'll be darned if I can remember any of the words (and I'm one of those people who can come out of a theater singing a whole soundtrack).

I love musicals, I really do, but for naming itself an ""opera"", you would expect the music to be better than the tripe heard throughout the whole movie. The entire soundtrack was completely forgettable and seemed to be lacking lyricism.

I really thought the plotline had potential (how cool does an organ repossessor sound?), and you could certainly tell the actors were giving it their all, but the movie just doesn't pull it off.

3699953,5,B001MT7ZEW,"If you like gore (or maybe can simply stomach it - no pun intended) and if you dig movies that are eccentric and weird and dark and musical, check out Repo! The Genetic Opera.
This film is amazing. It's the most original piece of work to come from a Hollywood director in nearly a decade. Darren Bousman is the director - a man of sequels and low-budget gross-out horror flicks. I hated the SAW films and I was a little apprehensive going into Repo! because I didn't know if I could handle the gore. But Repo! is an entirely different monster. It couples gore with absurd sound effects (kazoos, rubber bands snapping, comic-like effects) and musical numbers that are either moving or equally ridiculous. The lyrics, though somewhat awkward at moments, are THE movie's dialogue - they help move the story forward. Let me reiterate: THE LYRICS -ARE- THE DIALOGUE. This is an opera! Every word is basically sung, true to opera form.
You can thank creators Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, who envisioned a macabre opera about the underbelly of a society plagued with the need for plastic surgeries to perfect themselves and replace their dying organs - thanks to Neuro Overstimulation Syndrome, for this unique film.
It started as a stage play and while much of the story is lost on translation to film due to budget limitations, it's a decent beginning to what will hopefully have more pieces put into the puzzle. The comic-book style panels are entrancing and help move the story along, giving the viewer a sort of auditory intermission. They help make up for what couldn't be filmed - again, due to limitations - and provide the film with another unique aspect.
With players such as Paul Sorvino and Paris Hilton, one can only wonder what the hell Darren was thinking making this film. HOWEVER, these two names are NOT the star players in the film! Paris has only 12 minutes of actual screen time and Paul is merely a key background player, the villian of the story, a scorned lover bent on revenge. The real stars are Alexa Vega of ""Spy Kids"" fame, who lends her voice to many different styles of singing (punk rock, lamentation, jazz, etc) throughout the movie and holds her own as Shilo Wallace and Terrance Zdunich who plays the Graverobber and narrator. Graverobber has far too little screen time; much of the mid-story narration came only after filming was wrapped and added in to the film post-production. His vocals, while incredibly impressive, leave something desired if you've heard his stage play renditions of songs like ""21st Century Cure."" He doesn't display his vocal talent to it's full potential, but he does a fantastic job nonetheless holding his own against seasoned actors like Bill Moseley and Anthony Stewart Head.
There won't be another film like this one unless it gets a real fan base going, so if you see it and want to see more, tell your friends to check out the DVD or blu-ray. Get the word out! Let's see more original films and less remakes.",1234396800,,2976,4.7471042471042475

3699955,4,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo is one of those rare films (like Sweeney Todd)that successfully integrates way over the top camp, cartoon-like gore and operatic melodrama - although, in my view, this production is more ambitious, varied and interesting than Sweeny Todd.  Visually, Repo is darkly atmospheric and amazing - with stunning images, great camera work and effects, imaginative edits and excellent sound design.  Also, the actors seem to throw themselves completely into their parts with wicked joy - from Repo (Anthony Head), the vivisectionist with a song in his heart, to a dedicated and clearly maturing Paris Hilton(no kidding) as an overindulged, multi-faced, would-be diva who is also heiress to GeneCo, a medical services company that is sustained by  gleeful butchery, manipulation and greed, rather than any concern for human welfare. It is hard to imagine Repo as a commerical ""blockbuster,"" a ""date movie"" or appealing to more than a limited audience - it really is in the operatic tradition - but it is a unique and ambitious work that deserves a look (but only if you're not too squeemish).",1234310400,,1087,5.129943502824859
3699956,5,B001MT7ZEW,"I wasn't a huge fan of the Darren Lynn Bousman Saw movies. I really dug Saw II, but only because it was the only of the Saw films that had any potential. I mean, it picked up right after Saw 1 ended, which was necessary considering how that film ended. But after two and the ridiculous plot twists they started to take, I gave up on the series. I did see 3 and 4, but to be honest, I don't remember really anything about them- that's how forgettable they were. And no, I have not seen Saw 5 and am not particularly excited to.

So naturally I was a bit apprehensive about Repo. I thought the plot was stupid, and what the hell was a 'rock opera'? I had never heard of anything like that before, and with such a strange storyline (not to mention Paris Hilton), I had planned to never see this film. But one night, I was sitting around, bored as hell, and flipping through movies on demand when I saw Repo. I had been told be a friend just how amazing Repo was, and I figured 'what the hell. If it sucks, it's only $[...] and and hour and a half out of my life.' So I watched it. And am I glad I did.

Like most people, it took me a while to comprehend exactly what it was that I had just watched. I was confused, amazed, excited, and surprised-  like most people that saw this film. And after seeing it four times now, I think I can make a pretty safe review about this film.

It rocks.

I'm not going to rehash the story. If you want to know what it's about you can either look it up or read the other reviews. I'm going to get into the meat of this review- the music.

I'm not going to lie, I had my doubts about the music when I first saw the film. It wasn't exactly catchy, but it wasn't terrible to listen to. It's one of those things that has to grow on you, and the more I watched the movie the more I started singing along with the songs. The one that stuck with me from the get go was Zydrate Anatomy, which is catchy, strange, and just fun to hear. The Graverobber, by Terrance Zdunich, is a valuable asset to the soundtrack. I know he can't really technically sing, but I find his voice to be an interesting, fun addition to the soundtrack. Alexa Vega shows us here that she can sing, something I never knew about her, and she is damn good at what she does. She plays Shiloh, the innocent, naiive girl, to a T. Anthony Head is really great in his part and even sings really well, especially in the song Legal Assassin. Even Paris Hilton doesn't do a half bad job, aside from one agonizing note in Zydrate Anatomy.

However, some of the songs are less than memorable. Golds falls flat, in my opinion, and the others I can't even remember the names of. But I really loved the ballad 'I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much', because it was sung so emotionally between Anthony and Alexa. It really touches a chord.

No review would be complete if you didn't talk about the truly wonderful way that this film was shot. The sets are gorgeous and Darren uses some amazing filters and camera tricks to pull off some of the shots. True, it's not that much of a departure from the Saw films (look out for an abundance of yellows and blues), but the way this film is shot, even though we've seen it before from Darren, feels completely new.

However, the DVD falls flat. I know that Lionsgate tried to push this movie underneath the carpet and kind of screwed it, and I'm glad I at least have it on DVD, but this is the WRONG place to go for special features.

Yet for a rock opera, the music is the least interesting thing about the movie. There isn't a single song that leaps out at you, but seeing Spy Kid's Alex Vega belting ""Seventeen"" like Joan Jett is pretty cool, and the final ballad (""I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much"") has potential. The mass of the songs however, are one dimensional industrial rock and start bleeding into each other (pun somewhat intended).

The bloody plot is that Rotti Largo (Sorvino) has saved the world from an epidemic of organ failures by creating GeneCo, a designer body parts company. Yet - as do most of the rich and powerful - he is not satisfied. He hates his children, ain't too crazy about the population in general and has just been informed that he's dying. There's a dirty secret that he has forced upon Dr Nathan (Tony Head) and his daughter. Even nastier, Rotti convinced the government that falling behind on your surgical payments can be...murder. He orchestrates his final revenge on all of them at the final performance of his ""Genetic Opera.""

There are all the right elements for 100% coolness here, but the film just doesn't take advantage. There are no successful attempts to get the potential black humor to stick (save from the latest tired effort to deface Paris Hilton), and as previously noted, the songs are not particularly memorable. ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" seems so darned intent on becoming a midnight movie that it overshoots the target. It's one thing to be charmingly oddball, but ""Repo!"" shreiks LOOK AT ME! I'M OFFBEAT!"" with every quirky move. Which, sadly, makes the film more generic than genetic.",1234224000,8,2466,5.8635097493036215

The Good: The cast is wonderful. There are some solid voices amongst them. Even Paris Hilton wasn't too awful. If you like stage blood, you will be satiated.

The Bad: No memorable music. No character development. No real humour. No actual tunes. It's both pretentious and tedious. Watching it was excruciating. For those who would say that it's an opera, not a musical, listen to Verdi sometime. Notice the catchy music? Yes they sing everything in opera, but it's the music that redeems the lyrics. Here there is no redemption.

Conclusion: If you need to see a modern movie musical, rent Chicago. It's not wonderful, but it is ten times better than this waste of pixels. It is now and forever dull, which is fatal.

3699969,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo! The Genetic Opera could never have been a hit movie, it's to strange, to original for the simple minded movie going audience, it was born to be a cult classic, but not in the way movies fail to become one because they try to be one, it just is one. Musicals, by and large, are not my cup of posion, I don't care for all those faggy showtunes, or all those sequanized dances, I don't like what's going on, so I keep asking myself why is it going on. Repo! with it's dark Blade Runner-style visions, goth rock and ethiral opera music, it strikes the right chord with me to keep me from being distracted and being able to give into it's bizarre ides, after all in this kinda cyberpunk future vision, bursting into song might be all they can do to keep their calm. Unlike recent jabs at horror-musicals, SWEENEY TODD or PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, this one has contemporary music that sounds good to my under thirty year age ears, to like a musical, one must first like the music. The actors are all first rate, as actors and as singers, with Anthony Stewart Head standing out as the repo man, he injects the same passionate and understanding while singing his dialogue in the same fashion as he did once for a legendary episode of the hit TV series BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Sarah Brightman, as Blind Meg, is also a marval, a beautiful woman who's matched by her beautiful voice. The show actualy belongs to Alexa Vega, you may remember her from the SPY KIDS movies, in the lead role of the poor trapped Shiloah, she is both a smart hip songstress and a brooding teen actor. And director Darren Lynn Bousman, gets to show us he can do more than just SAW sequels. This is the kind of movie, we will hear more about in the years to come, love it now, and you'll say you love it back when, hate it, and later you'll be telling your friends, I just never got it. For me, it's like a good tune, it sticks with you. Like a true cult classic, I'm ready to see it again.",1234224000,2,1960,4.285714285714286
3699970,2,B001MT7ZEW,"if the title didn't give it away already, this is a friggin' ""rock"" opera. believe it or not, i continue to hear and read confused horror fans completely flabbergasted that there is absolutely no spoken dialog in this movie. i went in to this with an open mind, expecting the best.

unfortunately for me (and anyone else out there with decent taste in music), every single song in this thing reminds me of evanescence or one of the other hundreds of radio rock / nu-metal bands out there today, and i just can't get behind that. i tried to focus on the story, ignoring my disdain for the music, but it just wasn't possible.

aside from the 10 minutes bill mosley is in this and the scene where  paris hilton's face peel off (i don't think i'll ever get sick of seeing bad things happen to her in movies), this movie really blew a great plot. the writers destroyed this thing with laughable lyrics sung over one of the worst genres of music ever.

on the plus side, the movie looks great. dlb did a great job. some of the cgi is a little much for me, but it can be forgiven as it's only occasionally an issue.

3699971,4,B001MT7ZEW,"The basic storyline takes place in the near future when after a plague of organ failures, GENECO creates a steady supply of ""replacement parts."" However, in spite of the high cost, most people are not content to replace just the malfunctioning organ, but also get everything they want to become young once again. Of course, nobody can afford it, but GENECO has a payment plan which basically means you will spend the rest of your life paying them off.

And if you are 90 days late, the Repo Man comes for you to get the organs you purchased regardless of the fact you still need them.

So, rest assured, there is a lot of gore in this film and when I say there is a lot I mean when the Repo Men get GENECO's property back from unwilling customers who have defaulted on their accounts there are copious amounts of blood and guts.

So most people are going to see this film because they think it's a slasher film.

But it really isn't. This is why Repo!: The Genetic Opera has not only received bad reviews from the critics, but couldn't get any decent theatrical release. As a slasher film, the entire movie fails because the blood and gore is not the point. Nor is the supposed ultimate sin of capitalism the point. Or the music (it is a rock opera so 99% of the film is sung).

The film actually centers around two men: Nathan Wallace (masterfully played by Anthony Stewart Head) and Rotti Largo (played by Paul Sarvino) and lost in the gothic settings, the blood and the gore, the f-bombs, and the occasional nudity is the story of two men who because of the overwhelming love they have for their ungrateful children have made choices to become desperately evil.

Don't believe me? Watch the movie again and look beyond the sets and the shock and listen very carefully when the men interact with their children and what happens in the end.

So let's review the first two reasons why Repo!: The Genetic Opera failed with the critics:

  1. They were expecting a film with a plot no more complex than a slasher film, and
  2. The actual complex plot of the film is muddled by other elements.

Yet, there are two other factors that guaranteed the film's failure. Ready for this?:

  1. Sarah Brightman playing the role of Blind Mag, and
  2. Terrance Zdunich playing the role of the Greek Chorus in the character of Graverobber.

Now before you send me hate mail, let me explain.

The reason they destroyed the film is because they were *too* good.

They are so good when they go on the screen all you want to see is more of them. They get the best songs (with the exception of Head's Legal Assassin), the best lines, the best parts, and they play them so well, when they are on the screen, everything and everybody else becomes invisible. Especially when we're talking Sarah Brightman.

The film's theme got lost and its plot line derailed by the power and presence Brightman and Zdunich have as actors and singers.

So should you watch it? Depends on your ability to handle lots of blood and gore and I hope this review may have helped you with your decision.",1234224000,,3060,4.493670886075949

i'll reiterate what other people have already said: the music is awful.  painful.  there are one or two catchy songs, but the rest literally had me yelling at my TV.  i'm no music snob at all, i love all kinds of music... and i think it's really cool that this ""opera"" was written by 2 regular guys who ended up getting this made into a movie through some of their connections.  but once this movie was in pre-production, they really should have hired a professional composer/arranger to clean everything up...  because it sounds like it was written by 2 regular guys with little musical/opera experience.  i was embarrassed for the actors that they had to sing this stuff...  they put their hearts into their performances, and i'm sure they had no idea this is what the product would be.

when one of the highlights of a movie is paris hilton's performance, you know that it's time to turn the DVD off.  she did a good job, and sarah brightman is beautiful and her voice and acting are the only thing that elevate this out of being complete crap.

I love the music ,save for a few songs. =S But thats what the skip botton is for.
Creative scenes and film editing. I love the way the songs were put together But when I first heard the music soundtrack, I wondered where they were in the movie.
The soundtrack didn't follow the movie and songs that I heard on the movie had no place in the film, save for the ending credits. So, in the movie I felt that they left out some clips*maybe due to time*

Moulin Rouge
Saw

Here...let me save you some time.  If you liked any three of the four listed above, RUN to your nearest video store.  You've got an unforgettable 90 minutes ahead of you.  If not, keep reading- there may be hope yet.

Repo: The Genetic Opera is classed as a rock opera.  Like a normal opera, there is little to no spoken dialogue.  The music, however combines the melodic and lyrical cleverness of Sweeney Todd with the industrial riffs of Korn or Nine Inch Nails.  If you like the aforementioned bands, Within Temptation, Nightwish, Therion, or even Sarah Brightman, you can stop reading and hit one click purchase.  More time potentially saved....

So you're still reading...well, a guy tries.  Repo features a fantastic cast of actors and actresses.  Anthony Head (Buffy's Watcher), Alexa Vega (from Spykids, but you won't recognize her now), Paul Sorvino, Sarah Brightman, and Paris Hilton will all surprise you (well maybe not Sarah- you knew she could sing, right?).

Visually, the film is a tour-de-force.  The sets and costumes all come across as the labor of love that they are. I mentioned Saw above, however, because the film's premise is inherently gory.

The story is both engaging and surprising, and the writers melded the plot so seamlessly with the music that the resulting synthesis is stunning.

My one and only personal problem with the film is that it descends into self-indulgent raunchiness a couple of times.  It disturbs the flow of the film.  The deleted scenes indicate that a good bit of this was cut, but the minute or so that survives is unfortunate.

That one problem won't be an issue for most people that get their hands on this film, and it does little to deter my nearly unreserved admiration for and recommendation of the film.  It attempts something new and daring: the synthesis of the opera concept with the industrial sound and the theatricality of Phantom.

Finally, let me make a plea.  If you like the film or think you'll like it, buy it.  All people involved would like to make a sequel or a prequel, but the movie opened in very few theaters.  The hope is that it becomes a cult hit such that dvd sales can fuel another movie.",1233792000,2,2224,4.731770833333333

Used to be Europe was the source of cruddy ""music"" (- if you think ABBA is bad, for example, listen to what the Swedes were listening to BEFORE they came along! It will actually make you appreciate that band). There are scraps of decent melodies that start here and there in Repo, but they never gel into effective songs. No matter what you think of Sarah Brightman, she can actually sing; too bad they waste her here along with all the rest.

BUT... and this is a big deal considering this is a musical... the songs are just of poor quality. No memorable melodies or recurring themes, just bad talking/singing that would have been better done as straight dialogue. Even the decent numbers are so abruptly edited, that they (and the characters) aren't given a moment to shine. It's all very jarring and poorly done. Why not just make a horror movie with two or three rock numbers included?

Paul Sorvino, Sarah Brightman and Anthony Stewart Head were sorely wasted. Even Paris Hilton showed comedic flair that wasn't taken advantage of.

But the worst by far is the tone-deaf performance by Terrance Zdunich as the Graverobber. Excruciating, embarrassing work from an ego-driven writer that should have been stopped at conception. He truly was responsible for people giving up on the film 10 minutes into it.

This could have been so good, but the lack of a good composer killed it. Andrew Lloyd Webber, where were you when this was scored?",1233705600,2,1204,4.887254901960785

I'm not sure what the music was going for, but I didn't like it.  I'm pretty open when it comes to music, but I found it for the most part lacking in rhythm and melody.

The visuals were well done for the most part, with nicely textured, artfully lit, large sets.  Most of the CGI was Bladerunner-style billboards floating over the city.  I like the overall aesthetic, the art direction was good.

The opening of the movie and several intermediate scenes are presented as comic book panels, which seemed to be overly expository.  I prefer movies to actually show the story, not just tell it to me.

The plot was ok, if a little... well, not convoluted, I could follow it ok... ""clunky"" I guess.

Mainly it fails on the music - with the exception of the the opera song near the end and Shilo's last song, it's pretty bad, bordering on terrible in places.  Mostly it's a sort of talk-singing, which isn't melodic enough to be actual singing.  I am familiar with some of the actors, so know they are capable of singing, so I blame the songwriter/composer

That said: this is a highly enjoyable movie. It is bloody, dark, silly, emotional, and fun. The music is very catchy, and while it may not be the deepest ever, it is fairly clever and you'll find yourself singing the lyrics under your breath for days afterward. The poetry nerd in me does still enjoy a good slant rhyme.

I am personally not a fan of gross slasher horror, but I can handle it if it is done in an over-the-top, comic-booky way, and this was. But blood and guts alone do not bother me; human pain does. It is a bit gross, but if you can handle lots of blood and the occasional organ, eye, or bone being tossed around, you can watch it.

In short, this film is a very obvious commentary on plastic surgery and the human race toward genetic perfection, but an amusing one. There are some other overtones, but that's the main one. It's a dark universe where the industrial goth-thing has been a bit overdone, but it's still likable. Give it a shot.

As a last note, for those who are holding out on this movie only because they saw Paris listed among the credits - please get over it. I'm no Paris fan by any means, but she does not suck it up here. In fact, her presence in the movie goes with the flow of the film - a society obsessed with looks and designer organs.

The premise is amazing. In the future, mankind is plagued with a rash of organ failures.  One man, Rotti Largo, devises a system where an infinite number of replacement organs can be produced and forms the GeneCo corporation to do so.  Payment plans are worked out and mankind is saved.  Except for the folks who can't pay their exorbinant bills, that is.  That's where the Repo Man comes in.  You see where this is going?  The organs are company property, so delinquent accounts get hunted down like dogs and the organs are taken back. Awesome, no?  This and several characters' backstories are given to us in a stylish narrated comic book form that serves the film well.  Cool points all around.

Enter our cast.  Anthony Stewart Head of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy</a>&nbsp;fame is back in our lives and singing again as the twisted Repo Man trying to hold his life together while raising his 17 year old perpetually-ill daughter (Alexa Vega) by himself.  This man brings me much joy.  Co-creator Terrance Zdunich plays our guide to this twisted tale, known only as Graverobber.  Three guesses what it is he does in his spare time. Sarah Brightman lights up the screen as the indentured opera diva Blind Mag, who owes her creepy cyber-eyes to GeneCo.  Bill Moseley, Paris Hilton, and Nivek Ogre of the band&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skinny-Puppy/dp/B000LXST04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skinny Puppy</a>&nbsp;round out the cast as the three pathetic GeneCo heirs.  Not too shabby, eh?

""Repo"" looks wonderful.  Visually arresting, dark and colorful, and just downright cool the look is.  There is some serious gore as the repossessions happen mostly onscreen and it is a hell of a treat to see ASH hack away at his victims with such psychotic glee. Even Hilton doesn't distract too much.  After all, she's essentially playing herself: a narcissistic plastic surgery addict billionaire heiress bee-yatch who wants to be a singer but whose only actual talent is skankyness.  Apparently, the director wanted nothing to do with her but was eventually ""charmed"" into casting her.  Do I really need to spell out what ""charmed"" means in Hollywoodspeak?  Anyhow, Brightman is surprisingly fantastic and Graverobber is just plain cool.  A lot to like about this film.

On to the music.  It rides the line between contemporary mainstream musical and heavy metal opera and it rides it well.  But the fact that there is no dialogue that is not sung eventually becomes an annoyance.  Watching a father and daughter argue while singing when there isn't even any music playing can never be uncheesy.  I realize that real operas are entirely sung, but in this case it doesn't always work in the film's favor.  The songs themselves are typically filled with wonderfully macabre lyrics, rockin' grooves, and flashes of pure brilliance, but are often broken up by more sing-song dialogue when you just wish it would keep on rocking. And there are certainly a few clunkers on the soundtrack.  ""Seventeen"" is meant to be punk, but comes off as very Avril Lavigne-ish.  In fact, the scene was only salvaged for me by a surprise cameo from ex-Runaway Joan Jett.  The end gets a bit sappy as well, which is hard to do when the set is filled with dead bodies.

2008 was a hell of a year for musical fans of the bizarre variety.  Between this,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Horrible-s-Sing-Along-Blog/dp/B001M5UDGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a>, and Sweeney Todd, we have had much to be thankful for.  ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" is the weakest of the three, but strikes a very different chord.  One that I daresay has never been struck before and for that, it deserves much praise.  But on the other hand, I feel that the weak link in this is what should always be the strong point of a musical and that is the songs.  I LOVE the ideas presented; the metal guitars, twisted humor, and dark presentation, but the music itself really needed some professional smoothing-out and often fails to gather enough momentum to thrill when it should.  The story also fails to live up to the strength of the premise.  These are the reasons why Repo will likely not be regarded as a classic like Sweeney Todd, Nightmare Before Christmas, Rocky Horror Picture Show, or even the musical episode of Buffy ""Once More With Feeling"".  It's great fun and deserves a shot from any rock and horror fan, but it feels like it could have been so much better.

I think after seeing it twice, I not only bought the soundtrack (and subsequently played it about 15 times straight through). I actually enjoyed it so much, I'm considering buying a Blue Ray player just so I can see the deleted scenes that aren't included on the DVD copy. I think all the major plot points and reasons why this is a great movies have been touched on by many of the other reviewers. My addition is that this movie is so entertaining, it has made a non-musical person admit they actually love a musical.",1233100800,,628,4.285714285714286
3700001,1,B001MT7ZEW,"I saw this movie in theaters and wanted to like it.  I really did.  But after watching the whole thing I was left more than disappointed.  The idea for it is brilliant, but the execution falls more than short.  Horrible songs and actors with little to no talent make this painful to watch.  Besides, all of the dialog seems to be written by teenage goths who work at hot topic, and even though they have a good idea they don't understand the concept of story telling so they fail all over the damn thing.

It is good for a laugh, but not much else.  The idea is there, but it should never have been created as a musical for that is where it fails all over the place.",1233100800,16,666,4.15625

The music is quite catchy and has the potential for classic status. I truly was moved by this film. It's funny, gory, well played, quick paced and just all around cool to watch. The Repo Man is one great sympathetic monster, on par with the Phantom of the Opera. I'm pretty sure that making him like the Phantom was intentional. At least that's what I gathered from watching it. The singing, music, and comedy was highly entertaining as well. I wish more horror films could be this inventive.  Great job to all around.",1233014400,,657,4.5210084033613445
3700003,5,B001MT7ZEW,"It's too WEIRD. Too disturbing, and even awkward at times. But that's what makes it such a unique experience.

Am I allowed to say that this film exceeded my expectations, without sounding clich? It exceeded them, and embellished them. It stroked my expectations. It took my expectations and ran with them through the rain, dancing in puddles on the tar. It laid them out on red silk sheets with Rachmaninov playing in accompaniment.

Every time I read a bad review I have to laugh. These are crotchety old critics trying to come up with something award-worthy, and in doing so, they are completely missing the point. REPO is hilarious, gut-wrenching, sexy, horrifying, fascinating, and completely original. It is not Casablanca or Titanic. It is a futuristic rock opera about organ failure. It is also moving and beautiful in ways that traditional dramas could never be.

And the characters - how to describe? A multi-personalitied organ repossession man, his frail and earnest daughter, an opera singer with digital-video implanted eyeballs, a graverobber who draws a narcotic from corpse heads, a sex-obsessed narcissist who wears female faces for fun... you can't find this stuff at your local multiplex. It's too edgy. It's edgy to the point of nearly falling off - but it doesn't.

I've never gotten behind a movie to the point where I honestly must love and congratulate everyone involved. But everyone behind REPO? I love you all. Truly.",1233014400,3,1445,5.03347280334728
3700004,5,B001MT7ZEW,"The Greeks believe that all great works of art come from the muses. And REPO! creators Terrance Zdunich and Darren Smith have the best damn muse in the whole freakin world.

REPO! is a tale set in a futuristic world where an epidemic causes massive organ failures worldwide, and one company emerges as a savior of sorts. GeneCo manufactures new organs, and later turns plastic surgery into the latest fashion trend. Soon, changing everything from your face to your feet, and everything in between, is chic.

And just like the crack cocaine of today, this brave new world has a nifty drug called Zydrate. It is an addictive painkiller that is also sold as a cheap back-alley knockoff by Graverobbers, one of which serves as the Greek chorus to this bittersweet tale.

And just like that car of yours, your organs will be repossessed when you can't keep payments up. And that job falls to the Repo Man, a hooded scalpel-wielding SOB who carves you up like a turkey and absconds with your defaulted organs.

And where REPO! shines is not just its music, which is quite incredible. It also shines with its combination of interesting characters, like a man who wears the faces of women, and an incredible cast, that includes ""Buffy"" alum Anthony Steward Head (brother of Murray Head), former Spy Kid Alexa Vega (showing off the singing skills that wowed director Darren Lynn Bousman when he first saw her in a production of Hairspray), socialite Paris Hilton (where she provides a critic-defying performance as Amber Sweet, who ironically is the REPO! version of Paris herself), and the operatic skills of the stunning Sarah Brightman as the beautiful yet tragic opera singer Blind Mag, as well as the operatic skills of actor Paul Sorvino. And let's not forget Skinny Puppy frontman Nivek Ogre and horror alum Bill ""Otis Driftwood"" Moseley, who is also in a band called Cornbugs with musician Buckethead.

Overall, REPO! is the best film to come along in years, if not decades. If the unholy love child of Blade Runner and Rocky Horror knocked freak boots with the equally unholy love child of industrial rock and Wagnerian opera, then their love child would be REPO! The Genetic Opera.

And doubt the naysayers who think that this is pointless, stupid and whatever. This film deserves to be on the shelves of film buffs and casual film fans alike.

Ogre in those silver pants is enough to drive anyone crazy.
Not recommended for everyone, but if you enjoy something different and fun watch it.  It is the most unique and entertaining movie I now own.

The film is executed perfectly in order to pull off the unique mix of genres going on. All of the cast were great choices..Personally I think the Graverobber steals the show. After seeing the movie, for the next several weeks I couldn't get the songs out of my head..it helped that I had the soundtrack too, but the songs are just infectious..and different. If you are open-minded this is an entertaining movie.

We all have a dark side in us and if you are in touch with yours, and it won't hurt you to feed it a little bit, then you should watch this movie.  If you go to a dark place sometimes, this is a great way to channel that journey.  The cast does not hold back, they will push your limits and you will want more.  You have to enjoy touching your own darkness to enjoy this movie, if you can do that then these people and their story will live in that space for the rest of your life.
Just relax, and don't let your fear overtake you.
I also want to send a thank you out there to Anthony Head for the amazing energy he gave this movie.  I always enjoy his work (if you havn't gone past Buffy yet try Little Britain or the Dr Who episode ""School Reunion"") but this shows he can do anything.",1232928000,,837,3.9
3700008,5,B001MT7ZEW,"The creators of Repo! describe the film as a cross between the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Blade Runner.  Visually and thematically this is pretty close to what you are going to get.  Repo! is just campy enough to make it fun to watch with friends, yet well done enough to give it staying power.

Others have gone into detail about the plot, so I'm not going to bother.  Visually and sonically, Repo! is stunning.  The music ranges in quality from good to amazing.  Head's Legal Assassin and Brightman's Chase the Morning are particularly eerie, and are arguably the best numbers in the entire film.  Another jewel of the film is Zdunich's Zydrate Anatomy.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of singing in the film.  I had never seen her in another role, but Vega has quite a set of pipes on her.  I'm never thrilled to see Paris Hilton in a movie, but this was not a Paris Hilton Movie.  She played a smaller part than many in the ensemble, and she was good enough that she wasn't distracting.

I major word of warning should be issued to the squeamish or easily offended.  In terms of its horror roots, Repo! is no SAW.  You should not expect gratuitous violence and gore around absolutely every turn, but keep in mind that this is a film about an assassin who removes people's vital organs.  If you would be turned off by a violent depiction of disembowelment this picture is probably not for you.  Besides that there is some profanity, nudity, and sexual content that others may take issue with.  Repo! is rated R for a reason.

There are some nice features on the blu-ray.  There are several interesting featurettes on the history of and making of Repo! and some cut scenes.  Four of the more prominent songs also have their own sing-along style tracks with a bouncing human heart guiding you through the lyrics.  Despite this, I found the features a little lacking.  It would be nice to have the option to view the full film (a handful of numbers were cut out completely for this release).  The sing-along was great fun.  We watched Repo! at a party with friends and after the movie we went through the special features.  We played the sing-along tracks just for the hell of it and found ourselves singing along with the tracks.  It would be nice to have a version where this option was available not only for select scenes, but for the entire film (or at least for more than just four major numbers overlaid with the movie for a different experience).  If such a version were to come out it would also be nice to see additional features, including a piece on the Repo! tour.  The film is just begging for a multi-disc directors cut to come out, and I hope that we see that happen in the near future.

Overall I am rating this five stars, not because the film or the blu-ray features were perfect, but because the movie was refreshing and very fun to watch.  This is one of those movies that I will be able to watch again and again.  I would recommend doing as I did, and watching this not by yourself, but with several like-minded friends.  Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this movie is best experienced in the company of others.",1232928000,,3152,4.504409171075838

And he truly shines  as the repoman.  We once again bare witness to how good a singe he is, as was shown on Buffy a few times as well as his stint as Frank-n-furter in Rock Horror.

3700012,5,B001MT7ZEW,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray version as opposed to the regular DVD.  There are outtakes, one specifically involving the Gravedigger and Amber Sweet, that are not on the regular DVD.  The Blu-Ray disc is worth the extra for that single outtake alone.

Slightly scurrilous interests aside, there is also another outtake which appears to be a side plot that would make the entire movie more meaningful.  I can't say more without spoiling it, but the song associated with it is, ""Needle Through a Bug""

For those of you who are into 'the making of' sequences on DVD's, look at the interviews with the director and Terrance Zdunich--it's very clear that Zdunich is a very good actor when you see him 'as himself'.  The contrast is pretty startling.

Finally, in response to the few who haven't liked this because it has some gory moments--if you can't stand horror movies, you should stay away.  But, if you're willing to get into some pretty interesting social commentary about materialism and superficiality, the objectionable parts of this make pretty good metaphors for some of the more crass elements of our society.

I watched this with movie buff friends.  They kept counting, ""Rocky"" moments, that look like out-takes from the midnight fan shows;  they also found references to Metropolis, Nightmare Before Christmas and Dawn of the Dead.  For me personally, there are visual references to Chicago Story, Les Miserables and Gaiman's Sandman, or Oedipus, depending on what you read.  The ending is pure La Traviata.

That happens maybe once in this entire production during a very exposition-heavy scene.  It's that good.

This was made very painstakingly.  In fact, major parts of it were rewritten to accomodate actors performing parts of it not-quite-as-they-were-written.  Musically, this is pretty flawless.

That said, lots of other people have written great reviews of this.  I wanted to encourage more people to actually buy it:  when the discussion of this first went up on Amazon, this was opening in the city where I live.  What I didn't know, is that because of lack of publicity, the theaters here were almost empty--and it only opened to eight theaters in the entire country.

The composition of this took up about a decade of Terrance Zdunich's life, and it shows.  The music and supporting parts include musicians from Japan, the U.S. and the U.K.; Skinny Puppy and Joan Jett actually make appearances.  They got Poe to do the backing vocals.

Beyond the interest of celebrity cameos, this is a good story.  There are universal themes from the major religious traditions, like integrity, placing family above greed, and, the importance of self-determination.  Sure, it's a little odd to have scary with musical theater, but you won't be bored;  this is visually entrancing and musically addictive.

The music drones on and on in your ears with lyrics that neither work as song (no rhyming schemes or rhythmic patterns are used at all), or as storytelling devices usually used to move the plot forward. The visuals are about as backyard as any low-budget student film, and the direction almost non-existent.

The story itself is repugnant featuring many scenes of human-beings being disemboweled for entertainment (this is all shown in graphic detail), and lyrics about cutting holes in woman to have sex with them.

No decent person with any heart at all could derive enjoyment from garbage like this. How this film got an R-Rating instead of an NC-17 also escapes logic.

I wouldn't have even given it a single star except Amazon's rating system demands at least a one star for a review.

3700016,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Repo! The Genetic Opera is one of those bizarre, indescribable experiences that most people either love or love to hate. Think Saw meets Sin City with a splash of a Greek morality play and buckets upon buckets of blood and gore... oh, and there's singing. Lots of singing.
This over-the-top rock opera is set in a futuristic dystopia, where an epidemic of organ failures led to the founding of GeneCo, a company that swooped in to save the day with their organ financing programs- like a car loan. The catch, of course, is the repossession clause; should the recipient fail to make their payments, Rotti Largo, GeneCo's formidable mobster-like founder, sends one of his Repo Men to collect the organs. And these `legal assasins' are figures to be feared by everyone save for Rotti and his spoiled, miscreant children. Which brings us to the main plot: while Rotti's fearful image might be immortal, he has discovered that he is not. He's dying, and must name an heir to GeneCo and his large fortune. As he complains in song, his `children are a bust'. Luigi is a sociopath with anger management issues, whose favorite past time leaves an unsightly trail of dead bodies behind; Amber Sweet is not only addicted to surgery, but also to the cheap, street Zydrate (a powerful, and addictive, painkiller GeneCo developed) that her father outlawed; Pavi has appearance issues, apparently, and to compensate steals faces that he wears like masks.
So Rotti is dying and has no suitable heir to keep his company going. His once-promising protg, Nathan Wallace, lost favor when Rotti's girlfriend, Marni, fell in love with and married him. Rotti seems to have gotten his revenge, in the end, though; while pregnant, Marni fell ill with a rare blood disease and died when Nathan tried to cure her. He managed to save their daughter, Shilo, though Marni's death has turned him into every teenage girl's nightmare of an overprotective father. He will literally do anything to protect her (even if it means keeping her locked up in her bedroom). But, in order to keep from being legally blamed for his wife's death, he has struck a deal with the devil: in exchange for Rotti's help in smoothing the whole nasty incident over, he becomes a Repo Man.
Fast forward seventeen years; Shilo is now seventeen, a nave songbird who spends her time collecting insects, watching her idol, Blind Mag, on television, and hanging out in her mother's tomb. She suffers from the same blood disease that she was told killed her mother, and as far as she knows, Nathan is a busy doctor. While she thinks he spends his days and nights tending to patients, he's wrestling with his dark alter ego (cudos to Anthony Head; Nathan's transformation into the Repo Man is downright chilling).
They don't always see eye-to-eye, but Shilo generally respects her father's orders to stay indoors. Until one night when she chases an insect out into a graveyard and meets a Graverobber- criminals who traffic in stolen organs and street Zydrate that they extract from the dead. Rotti discovers her and decides that she will serve as his heir-provided she can pass his test. Before long, Shilo is thrust headlong into this dangerous and strange world, discovering the truth about her past, and ultimately the nature of true freedom.
As the name would suggest, this is a musical; there is very little spoken dialogue, most of it is sung, but the cast carries it well (Head, Paul Sorvino and Terrance Zdunich in particular). The music alternates between full-on operatic numbers, like `Chromaggia', to Shilo's teen rebellion punk anthem, `Seventeen' (during which Joan Jett makes a random cameo), and the delightfully-demented `Thankless Job' (in which the Repo Man laments the lack of appreciation for his profession). Terrance Zdunich's Graverobber steals the show as a sort of demented Greek Chorus, at times talking (or singing) directly to the audience.
The not-so-subtle commentary centers on the consequences of a society obsessed with appearance and status (as Graverobber says: ""So why care for these petty obsessions? You're designer heart still beats with common blood... and what if you could have genetic perfection? Would you change who you are if you could?""), and the equally dire consequences of hate, power and vengeance (""Goth opera. Blood saga... sometimes I wonder how we ever got here. Old grudges. Scorned lovers... sometimes I wonder why we all don't move on!"")
Repo is a stylized and visually-arresting masterpiece painted in grit, blood and gore; a morality tale about the consequences of vanity, pride and hate. It isn't for everyone, but if you have a bit of a twisted sense of humor, and an appreciation for the odd and offbeat, this might be the new cult hit for you.",1232755200,2,4747,4.935

3700018,5,B001MT7ZEW,"I've heard complaints that there is virtually no spoken dialogue in this film (instead the narrative is entirely in song) and that it's over the top and somewhat melodramatic.

Bear in mind though that despite all of the gothic-futuristic trappings, gore, and modern style of much of the music, this is still an opera, and opera cannot be done with any sizable measure of emotional subtlety.

A visual and auditory fever dream, ""Repo!"" manages to combine one of the most oddly assembled casts in recent film history with rich saturated visuals, way-off-color humor, ballsy musical numbers, and salacious horror to create a feast that is already on its way to becoming a bona-fide cult classic.

Sarah Brightman is luminous as the tragic Blind Mag, and it's nice to see her theatrical skill applied to a medium other than the stage. Alexa Vega ably offers her role as Shilo with equal parts adolescent vulnerability and teenage angst. Always a fine actor, Paul Sorvino's singing is pleasantly stunning, and the job done by Buffy The Vampire Slayer's Anthony Stewart Head blows any of his previous roles out of the proverbial water.

I was also greatly impressed and amused by the performance of Skinny Puppy lead singer Ogre as Pavi Largo, given his usually off-the-radar and mysterious persona.

Who knew the guy was so funny?!

Not to mention, that he manages to take a role so morally reprehensible, lacking in character, and impossible (I hope) for most people to relate to and yet somehow still make him engaging to watch and dare I say it... likable.

Yes, Paris Hilton is in this as the spoiled drug-addled trampy daughter of Paul Sorvino's character, but let's face it: She ran after this role for a reason, and even if you don't like her (I certainly don't), you have to give her credit for the brains, sense of humor, and sense of irony to recognize the all-too-obvious parallels people would make. You can almost feel her purposely parodying herself. Good for her, I say, and she played her role well, for its inherent limitations.

This is one film not to be missed, and I'm willing to bet it's not going away any time soon as the buzz spreads.",1232668800,4,2155,4.774193548387097
3700019,5,B001MT7ZEW,"First of all let me state that this review is written exclusively for Sarah Brightman fans debating whether or not to buy ""Repo"" however, I do feel that others may also find this review helpful as well.
Before I begin let me say that I feel that ""Repo"" was very unfairly slammed by the American Press and did NOT get a fair review at all.  It's a very, very good movie when you consider what it is...which is a CULT film/musical like the famous/infamous ""Rocky Horror.""
Sarah Brightman's fans may be puzzled why she made such a film.  Let me state that if you look at her career, she's ALWAYS liked scary stuff and is obviously a fan of classical British horror (i.e. Hammer Films, etc.)  In fact, in her latest stage production of ""Symphony"" there is a very cool sequence where she, as ""Red Riding Hood"" pedels a bike frantically through a forest pursed by wolves that is brilliant (this is the actual live tour, and is sadly NOT, I repeat NOT on the ""Symphony"" Vienna DVD.)
""Repo"" is very scary, and also very funny and also very moving.  Before passing judgement on it unfairly, consider this...when it first came out ""Rocky Horror"" was viewed as shocking and NOBODY liked it...in fact it tanked.  Now, over a span of literally DECADES it's cool and even oldsters like it.  The same holds for ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which, when it was released was a ground-breaking horror/musical which people thought was somewhat shocking.  So use this perspective to judge ""Repo"" which is the 21st century version of ""Rocky Horror"" (yes...remember guys it's a NEW century!)  With that being said let's talk about Sarah Brightman in the movie.
Her performance is nothing short of brilliant and is, frankly the BEST performance in the movie, even though she isn't the main character.  She's a real show-stealer.  Her appearance at Shiloh's house is one of the best scenes in the movie and for those of us who didn't get to see her in the original ""Phantom of the Opera"" we can get an idea of why she made it the most popular musical thus-to-date. (As an aside, it's sad that apparently NOBODY made a visual recording of the original ""Phantom"" although original cast CD's exist.)
Unless you've seen her live, this will be one of your best bets, and perhaps your only chance to see how good she is at live theatre/stage musicals.  She's GREAT.  It's very important to remember that before she became a cross-over artist, Sarah Brightman was a singer and a dancer and a stage performer.  ""Repo"" gives you, her fan, a chance to see why she's so good in live theatre.  However, before you buy it, you need to consider two things: 1. Many people in the USA who like Sarah Brightman are somewhat conservative...so you have to visualize the following scene.  Remember at the start of ""La Luna"" where Sarah Brightman appears on the steps dressed like a Greecian priestess and sings, ""Winter in July.""  Now imagine the end of ""Harem"" where she sings, ""A Question of Honor.""  Now combine both of those and visualize her being brutally and ritually sacrificed.  (I'm not adding any spoilers here...just setting the tone.)  If that thought bothers you, and you do NOT like blood and gore then DON'T buy ""Repo!!!!""  That simple.  If, however you are intrigued...perhaps remembering how the great Kate Bush also let herself get brutally strangled on the stage at the end of her song, ""Hammer Horror"" then BUY ""Repo.""  2. MANY of Sarah Brightman's USA fans also have children who LOVE Sarah Brightman.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT show this movie to your kids...it will upset them TOO MUCH.  Did you hear that...don't show this movie to young children!
With that being said, let's recap our criteria for buying ""Repo."" First: You have to be willing to want to be really scared and be willing to see Sarah Brightman bring off a death worthy of Shakespeare or Sophocles or John Webster and Second: If you have young children who love Sarah DO NOT show this to them! Did you hear that...NO children should watch this no matter how much they love Sarah...ok!!!!
So, if you are up to it, ""Repo"" will give you an idea of how brilliant Sarah Brightman is in live theatre (since most people in the States have never been able to see her in that medium.) I loved ""Repo"" and hope that Sarah Brightman might actually be encouraged to do some more(perhaps less violent)movie musicals so we can see her talent in that medium as well.  I also think that it's exciting she did this because younger adult Americans who've never heard of her (she gets virtually NO air time here in the States) will perhaps become intrigued and start buying her music.
Let's remember that it's easy to judge something young and new like ""Repo"" and say it's violence and trash.  HOWEVER, let me remind everybody that at one time that remark was made about all classical drama or literature.  Shakespeare is EXTREMELY violent as is Sophocles.  One of the most violent and sexy snuff scenes I've ever seen was a live stage production of the ""Duchess of Malfi"" by John Webster. (I'm a military historian, but my undergraduate degree is World Literature.)  In fact, I'm pretty sure that this violence is the reason why the ""Duchess of Malfi"" is seldom performed in the USA and that there is NO DVD of it.  In addition, if anybody has ever seen live Kabuki theatre it's EXTREMELY bloody with heads flying off, blood spraying and women dying from being stabbed in the throat. So it's important to remember that in a stage production like ""Repo"" the violence is NOT the mindless violence of a ""Terminator"" movie...the violence has a point.  ""Repo"" like the ""Duchess of Malfi"" or ""Oedipus Rex"" or ""Hamlet"" is a morality play.  However, it's a MODERN morality play for a young-adult audience.  So...if you're a Sarah Brightman fan,and bloody stage violence ala ""Julius Caesar"" doesn't bother you and you think you can stand watching her die nobly and tragically like the Duchess of Mali does in Webster's play, then get ""Repo"" with the caveat that you DO NOT show this to younger children who might also be Sarah Brightman fans. Did you hear that...don't show it to young children who like Sarah Brightman!  (But you can watch it, shudder with terror and enjoy!) P.S. I must admit that even though I enjoyed ""Repo"" I hope that if Sarah makes any more movies perhaps they won't be this violent so that her younger, more sensitive fans can see her stage/theatre talents as well.",1232668800,3,6403,4.677361853832442

Had no idea it was a musical, let alone rock opera. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. The songs are very catchy and at the end had me searching for the soundtrack. I was mesmerized through this whole movie. I mean, even Paris Hilton surprised me. When I first saw her name, I was like, ""Paris Hilton, Really?"". She actually did a decent job. It may not be some peoples cup of tea because of violence or lack of liking heavy ROCK music, but give it a chance. I did, and now I get the pleasure of listening to this masterpiece whenever.",1232668800,3,676,4.207692307692308
3700023,4,B001MT7ZEW,"This movie isn't for everyone. It's easier to watch on blu ray though, but then everything looks better blu! It's a gory horror film with all the lines sung to good hard rock music.  It has a good cast and a five minute cameo role from Paris Hilton.  It started out as a stage play and it retains that look even though cgi has created a larger world for it.
Certainly if you don't like musicals you won't enjoy this flick and if you don't like original horror then forget about it too. But I enjoy both fields so this was a fun movie for me.  And it's not the worst movie of 2008. There were other  movies that had half this cast and dedication and  that  includes a great Paul Sorvino performance.  No one has anything to be ashamed about here; it's a rock opera stage play transferred to the screen.  It's not a great movie but is a interesting one within it's two genres. I feel that critics should judge horror and musicals both on seperated scales than dramas , and then subdivide them by their budgets. This has a good budget and was done with a certain glee that makes it a fun ride.  You don't need to know much more than the repo man goes after those who can't afford to keep paying for their transplants and that there is a satire element in picturing a future society that is completely surgery crazy both organ wise and plastic surgery wise.
Good fun on that level but it's  not for everyone , especially small kids.",1232582400,,1428,4.294776119402985
3700024,5,B001MT7ZEW,"I Wanted to see this in a Theater but missed it by a DAY.  Heard the Soundtrack and Loved it.  Once I Owned it I couldn't Imagine NOT Having it after I jumped through a couple of Hoops to get my Copy from a Borders Store, But I Still got it.  The movie is Amazing.  Not many places do you see a Movie that combines Blood & Guts, Hard Rock, Opera, a Killer Storyline, and an Excellent Cast of people [Sarah Brightman, Paul Sorvino, Ogre, and Bill Moseley Just to name a Few] SINGING songs that are at such Polar Oppoites as Hard Rock and Opera could Possibly be, and have it ALL in ONE MOVIE, and have it mix SO GREATLY.  That is SUCH a HUGE RARITY.  And when it DOES Come along you just HAVE to own it.  Well This is that Movie.  I knew I was going to be in for a Wild Ride, but I had NO IDEA it was going to be such a Wonderful Ride till I got it home and WATCHED it.  To see a Repo Man actually REPOSSESS a SPINE, and a Heart in the way he does, and to see him pulling organs out of a Person WHILE SINGING is Even BETTER.  lolol  However I would have never thought about checking it out had Sarah Brightman NOT Been in it.  I LOVE Sarah Brightman, and couldn't believe she was going to be IN a Movie, Much less one like THIS.  I saw a couple of Clips on YouTube and my Desire to have this movie Jumped Exponentially.

If you like Horror, Blood & Guts, Musicals [Eventhough this is actually a Rock OPERA sung from Begining to End] Then this is a MUST for your Collection.  However this makes ""Sweeney Todd"" Look like a Walk in the Park where the Blood & Guts is Concerned.  But it is STILL a Wonderful Movie.

So GET IT, and let it INFECT YOU.  Just be warned there is NO CURE for the Addiction that it will Cause in you.  lolol  You won't be able to get ENOUGH of it.  At least I can't.

3700029,3,B001MT7ZEW,"A few years ago I went to see Rob Zombie's directorial debut ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and I remember driving home not knowing what the hell I just watched. I wasn't sure it was actually any *good* but I knew it was different. I had that same feeling tonight after watching ""Repo! The Genetic Opera.""

It is what it is, operatic but with a distinct goth/rock feel. Very little of the dialogue is spoken, it's mostly sung. The look of the whole thing was a mishmash of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Blade Runner"" and the Nine Inch Nails music video for ""Hurt."" So visually it was arresting to be sure.

I didn't like it at all at first, the first 20 or so minutes was pushing me to just turn it off but it grew on me......somehow.

The film's plot (if you can call it that) is we're in the not-too-distant future where the world has seen an epidemic of organ failures and one company offers something of a cure-all. They specialize in organ donors but the catch is if you fail to make your payments, they send a repoman to reclaim the heart, kidney, whatever from you....forcibly.

Obviously there's a strong horror movie vibe going on here with some macabre imagery (and a dash of sci-fi thrown in) and having everything played out in these grand operatic gestures dressed up in trashy goth outfits.....well......it's different. Certainly not something for everyone but I'm willing to bet ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" will find a very loyal cult following.",1232582400,33,1467,4.652509652509653
3700030,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Take one part rock music, one part bio/steam punk, a future city in devastation and you have Repo! The first thing you will notice about Repo is the music. I will say Repo is different from any movie you have ever seen. Not only is it a different movie, but the music crosses various genres and delivers you a beautiful blending of music.

Repo is not just a musical, it is an Opera and operas are usually sung from beginning to end with little dialogue. There is some beautiful opera music with lead vocals by Sarah Brightman, but there are also razor sharp rock duets by Sarah and Anthony Stewart Head. Another notable singer in Repo is the very talented Paul Sorvino, who I had no idea could sing so well! Let me also jump on the bandwagon that Paris Hilton is in this film, and it's not what you think...exactly. This role changed my opinion about Paris, the part was not only perfect for her but she is only in it for a brief time (and performed very well). She's an addicted surgery addict, head of the ""Zydrate Support Network."" What is Zydrate you ask? It is a futuristic drug that eases the pain of frequent surgery, without the side effects of having to go under while getting surgery.

The songs are brilliant, simple but highly effective and most definitely will get stuck in your head (even the brief ones). The various musical talents shine on the movies soundtrack, vocals, and guitars, beautiful with a side of razor blades. Notable songs include ""At the Opera Tonight,"" ""Things You See in a Graveyard,"" ""Legal Assassin,"" ""Zydrate Anatomy,"" ""Chase the Morning,"" and ""We Started this Opera S**t.""

The next thing I love about Repo is the visuals; dark and colorful, they are stunning and well done by the creative team at SwitchVFX. They are in fact so beautiful that it makes you want to see it in person, as if it were a real place. Some wonderful effects to note include the city in ruins, 3d portraits and digital corneas. There is an overall glow on the film that draws you in and makes you want to be a part of a futuristic world with advanced technology.

Let me also same the premise of the story is amazing. In the distant future, organ failure became a worldwide problem. In the midst of finding a cure, thousands died and grave markers can be found everywhere as a reminder to the city and its people. GeneCo found a cure, replacing organs on a financing plan. However, those who miss their payments....Geneco send out the Repo Man (there is some blood/gore but it's very minimal). The thing about the organ collecting is its legal! ""90 days delinquent and you get the repo treatment.""

I also want to talk about what very few musicals I enjoy. There are classics including ""The Sound of Music,"" ""The Nightmare before Christmas."" Some recent ones I enjoy include ""Chicago"" and ""Sweeny Todd,"" however many people compare Repo to Rocky Horror Picture Show and Blade Runner. I want to say ""Sweeny Todd,"" fell short for me, the music wasn't that great and Rocky Horror is just not part of my generation nor is ""Blade Runner"". Sure the visuals of Repo remind me of ""Blade Runner,"" however they vastly improved on their visual ideas and there is nothing wrong with that. If one wants to say Repo reminds them of such movies, great but I think Repo is today's ""Rocky Horror"" for my generation. It was made for cult movies/cult TV fans and you will either totally understand or ""get"" the world of Repo or you won't.

One thing is for sure; after I saw Repo I had so many questions. What happens next? What happened before? I also want to say Repo is a cult film; it's been driven by the creators and only fan support (little if no corporate help whatsoever). Repo has created a fan family community and I invite you to check out the world of Repo.",1232496000,3,3765,4.529411764705882

3700035,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Every so often a film of some form or another comes out and sparks a frenzy of interest due to it's complete and utter originality.  In the past films like, ""Reefer Madness"", ""Rocky Horror' and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" were such movies, and all of these movies I adore.  Yet, not until now has one been so perfect for my tastes; past and present.

I love horror films, I love musicals, I'm a huge ASH fan (Anthony Stewart Head) and I'm a huge DLB fan. (Darren Lynn Bousman) So when I heard he was releasing a horror/rock opera I was SO there.  Unfortunately, Lionsgate ended up the distributer and I failed to find a theater in even a 100 to 200 mile radius from me where it was playing at, and The Repo road tour didn't come near my home town.  So as soon at it was available to order, I was there.

I watched the film and fell in love.  The story is simple. In the future massive global organ failures begin to drastically diminish the population, until a saviour comes out of nowhere in the guise of Geneco run by Rotti Largo (a surprising and fantastic Paul Sorvino) and his three children: Luigi (a murderously evil Bill Moseley of Texas Chainsaw 2), Amber Sweet (played perfectly and sluttily by Paris Hilton) and Pavi (played unrecognizably by Ogre of the group Skinny Puppy).  Geneco gives those suffering from failing organs a chance at a new life; at a price.  If you miss a payment on your new organ Geneco sends out a Repo Man, a legal assassin who's only job is to find you and take back the organ in question, and he doesn't do it nicely.  He rips it out of your body and kills you in the process.  Rotti's head Repo Man is Nathan Wallace (the fantastic Anthony Stewart Head), a former friend and now slave due to what he did to his wife, Rotti's ex girlfriend Marni.  He kills and repo's for Rotti in penance for his crime.  Nathan has a daugther, Shiloh (sung and acted fantastically by ""Spy Kids"" alum Alexa Vega) who he keeps locked up due to a questionable blood disease and his insecurities of the world.  But Shiloh longs for the outside world and in her nightly escapes meets a Graverobber and begins to experience the horrors of the outside world.  Enter Blind Mag ( played incomparably by Sarah Brightman), Marni's best friend and Shiloh's godmother, her struggle for freedom from Geneco, Rotti's masterplan to leave the company with Shiloh, and Nathan's secret life as the Repo man set the stage for a bloody and heartwrenching story of loss, lies, redemption, choice and love beyond measure.

Not only is the story well done, the music is fantastic.  With crowd pleasing dance numbers like ""Infected"", ""Zydrate Anatomy"" and ""We Started This Opera S**t"", to roll in the floor pieces like ""Mark It Up"", ""Thankless Job"" and ""Bravi!"" to the heart wrenching ""Chase The Morning"" , ""Gold"" and ""I didn't know I loved you so Much"".  The music is fantastic and so original, and not just there for kicks but there to serve and push the plot forward.

The film also gives us horror fans a good bit of gore, from ripped out hearts, to disemboweled torso's, to severed heads and ripped out spinal cords.  The gore is top notch but not so over the top as to pull you from the plot (except for in ""Thankless Job"" which gets a good chuckle.)  The acting is also top notch.  I find it hard to believe that Anthony Stewart Head (Giles of ""Buffy"") was not honored with a Golden Globe nom in the very least.  His portrayal of a haunted and overprotective father is heartwrenching to watch.  He has singing chops as well.  Paul Sorvino is captivating to watch as Rotti Largo, and damn can he sing. (he shines in the song ""Gold"".)  Alexa Vega is well cast as Shiloh, and she gets her time to shine with the infectious sound of ""Infected"" and the angry ""Seventeen"".  But it is Sarah Brightman who truly shines.  I was unable to keep my eyes of her as she was beautiful to look at and also to listen to.  ""Chase the Morning"" and ""Cromaggia"" are two of the best songs I've ever heard in ANY musical.  No wonder their being considered for Oscar noms.

All in all you can't miss this film.  If you love horror, watch it. If you love musicals, watch it.  If you love different and original, watch it.  And if you don't like these things you should still watch it.

The actors and Actresses do a more than amazing job in this film, pulling you into the world of rock and organ re-possesion. You'll want to watch this film again and again.
If you're anything like me, i suggest you buy two copies, because you never know when you'll need a backup!",1232496000,7,657,4.306451612903226
3700038,5,B001MT7ZEW,"This movie is amazing!  The scenes are very creepy and unsettling, but at the same time very appealing and artistically beautiful.  Even if you hated the music or plot, which I didn't this movie alone for the scenery is worth a buy.

Now about the music.  At first I was uncertain of how to feel regarding their musical numbers, and by the third song I was hooked.  The lyrics in this are comedic at times, other times serious, and actually nearing the end there is a song that I think is pleasant, ""I Didn't Think I'd Love You This Much,"" is the name of the song I believe.  The vocals of lead Alexa Vega are great, strong, and defined.  Even Paris Hilton surprised me as this is the first time I have heard her vocals, and it reminded me some some old school goth rock cd I'd listen to in high school.  Finally, Sarah Brightman.  What can I say about Sarah that anyone doesn't already know?  Musical Wise, she was nothing short of spectacular.

Acting wise, I'm a big junkie for Bill Mosley and it was fun to see him pull off the comedic cult character he portrayed.  Paris, actually did great acting, it surprised me how great Alex Vega did considering I had never seen her attempt anything like this, and I was surprised that Sarah Brightman could be as dark as she was in this movie.  The casting meshed well and it was fun to see such big names in a movie that hadn't hit theaters in my area.

Art wise, the scenes were mind-blowing.  There are scenes where there is much cgi used, but overall it looks good, and that's saying a lot for me considering I hate cgi.  Also, the make up was great with good effects, example, if the box hadn't said Paris was in this I doubt I would have recognized her until the end.

Overall, I rarely say this.... But I wish I could give this a higher rating then a 5 star.  I will be buying the soundtrack as soon as I complete this review.  Repo! Will be played a second time tonight for my posse... Yes, it was that good.",1232496000,80,1961,4.265582655826559
3700039,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Either you love this movie or you don't. I personally love this movie. Its not a movie for the ""mainstream"" world. This is a movie that was created ""outside of the box"". Mixing horror, gore, comedy, and musical all into one created something new and amazing. This movie is not meant for everybody. Its either you love it or you don't. There's no in between on this movie. The soundtrack to the movie is awesome and very catchy. This has become one of my favorite movies.",1232496000,4,470,4.476744186046512
3700040,5,B001MT7ZEW,"In the far future, an outbreak of organ failures has spread throughout the world nearly killing off the entire population. However, a biotech company called Geneco ran by corporate fatcat (Paul Sorvino) now offers organ transplants for a good price but unfortunately they require monthly payments as those that don't pay for their transplants pay the price for repossession as the Repo Men who can take their organs away. It's a crummy world where crime happens all the time and people are addicted to surgery and drugs, a young girl (Alexa Vega) has a rare disase that she is in need of a cure and falls for a Grave Robber (Terrence Zdunich) who wants to help her.

An outstanding, gory and unique Sci-fi/horror/fantasy/comedy musical rock opera! From the makers of the ""Saw"" series and wonderfully directed by Darren Lynn Bousmann, this is a one-of-a-kind extraganza based on a cult stage musical. Co-starring Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley (""The Devil's Rejects"", ""House of 1000 Corpses"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""), Anthony Stewart Head (Giles on ""Buffy""), Ogre and Sarah Brightman, the film is an interesting and entertaining futuristic satire about what if the rights to have perminate transplant organs were taken away as if they were on loan and also a metaphor on consumerism much like Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" did. It's about what if we all got greedy with too much plastic surgery and too much beauty on the outside, the acting is quite good here and there's memorable rock musical numbers that are very original. There's even some scenes of gruesome gore that doesn't go over the top but in a more comical kind of way and some awesome animated comic-book esque panals that tell the story of the film more during some parts of the film, this movie is guaranteed to be a geniune cult classic for years to come and has recently been nominated for best music score.

This Blu-ray features eyepopping picture and sound with awesome extras like audio commentaries, Theatrical Trailer, Poster gallery, featurettes, sing-a-along features, Select Scne commentary with Paris Hilton and Director Darren Lynn Bousman, Deleted Scenes with optional commentary and ""Form Stage to Screen"" documentary, i highly recommend this movie.

Also recommended: ""Heavy Metal"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Blade Runner"", ""V For Vendetta"", ""Poultreygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead"", ""The Phantom of the Opera (2004)"", ""Akira"", ""Escape from New York"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"", ""Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)"", ""Babylon A.D."", ""Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2"", ""Flash Gordon"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Dark City"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""The Island (2005)"", ""Gattaca"", ""28 Days/Weeks Later"", ""Terminator 1 & 2"", ""Rock and Rule"", and ""Total Recall"".",1232496000,,2767,5.185682326621924

3700042,5,B001MT7ZEW,"I love horror/gore and I love musicals, so put the two together and I am on cloud nine. I went in to this with VERY high expectations and I was not at all disappointed. I've seen it twice in theatres (driving an average of 3 hours ONE WAY to get there) and it is finally coming back to LA this weekend and I'm there again for my third viewing! Not only is it visually stunning, but the eclectic cast is simply amazing. Words cannot describe how much I love this film. I've taken others to see it and so far, everyone has really enjoyed it. It's so original.

In response to that negative review, I am not so sure you were paying that close attention because three of your four points are an important part of the film:

1) Understand what motivates the characters <-- did we see the same movie?
2) Allow us to ""feel"" for the characters <-- see above; you realize what Sorvino's character was doing, right?
3) Understand what the plot or story of the film is <-- it's not the deepest movie, but it seems as though some things went over your head
4) Allow us to learn or feel anything from the generic car commercial well past its expiration date 21'st century wannabe goth/industrial schlock they call an opera. <-- i'm speechless

So, if you like violence and musicals, why not put them together and check out the best cast of characters you'd never think to put together and enjoy Repo the Genetic Opera. I bought my copy today (Best Buy's LAST copy) and two more today (for brother and sister) here on Amazon . Check it out!",1232409600,3,1526,4.366197183098592
3700043,5,B001MT7ZEW,"Ignore the critics. The movie doesn't make an effort to be anything more than it claims to be: a rock opera involving gore. So if you put this movie on expecting to see people getting their spines ripped out set to an awesome rock soundtrack - you're going to get exactly that.

Of course, there's a lot more to it than that. You can say the characters are great and engaging. You'll notice the costumes are all elaborate and all the sets look fantastic and really set the dark mood. You'll notice the award nominated music shifts from fast-talking melodies to industrial metal to classical opera. And sure, if you read deep enough into it, you'll even see that the movie is a social commentary on our obsession with obtaining beauty, and the terrifying consequences of what may be should we continue down that path.

It's not for the squeamish or the easily offended. Which basically means, if you're out of touch with the mainstream, you're not going to like this movie. For the rest of us, it's pure entertainment. And just to toss it in - The Rocky Horror Picture Show saw a limited release and was slandered by critics but loved by movie goers. Sound familiar, Repo fans?",1232409600,2,1176,4.595238095238095
3700044,5,B001MT7ZEW,"This is one of those films that is not fully appreciated immediately. REPO! The Genetic Opera is an excellent film, one I would recommend to everyone. While some may be put off by the fact that it is a movie with singing, it is a truly unique film experience. The story is well told and enhanced by the musical numbers. In fact, I recommend picking up the soundtrack with the movie. Aside from the excellent story and songs, REPO is an outstandingly beautiful film. A combination of many styles classic gothic to technologically futuristic. I can almost promise that if you pass on REPO now, you will come back to it again. Don't wait.

  We keep watching it over and over... It is visually stunning, musically addictive and has a captivating story. I now own the DVD as well as my previously purchased soundtrack. When we are not watching it, we are playing the soundtrack. Not fit for young children but my teens LOVE it as do I.

While Anthony Head is great, the Grave Robber (Creator of Repo) steals the show. They should not have cut any of his scenes. The studios have also screwed Repo over as well thinking that nobody will ever want to see this film.

But I usually disagree with test audiences and studio heads, so it stands to reason that I love this movie.

This movie is Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Blade Runner meets Max Headroom meets Saw.  And it takes all that is awesome and great from all those sources and throws in so much more.

This movie is worth every star in the rating I give it, and then some.

This movie isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. IT will be a cult classic. Reviewers hated Rocky Horror. Now this ISN'T Rocky Horror in any way shape or form. It's just like Rocky Horror something that must people would not have considered making or seeing.

Anthony Head. . . .EXCELLENT psychopath loving father. Alexa Vega. . .not a strong singer but held her own in acting the isolated daughter. And as much as I hate to say this. . .and you will NEVER most likely hear me say this again. . .Paris Hilton was HOT. Paris if you read this you really need to ditch the blonde hair and go Gothic black. Terrance Zdunich as Graverobber was funny and defiant of the corporate world.

The Genetic Opera is a mind blowing treat for everyone who knows a good film when they see it. Of course, little kids should NOT be seeing this- it is incredibly violent and gory. But with that aside, this film is a specatuclar visual and audio treat. With a talented cast of actors (yes, Hilton was good in this) and amazing visuals, this is a must see.

Genetics is a bitch. In the year 2056, There has been an epidemic of organ failures. However, GeneCo, a transplant company, has stepped in and decided to help people who have suffered the misfortune of the failure. Such organs as Thyroids, Intestines, Brains, organs, and Spines are replaced and soon, surgery becomes a fashion statement. ""But I can't afford the surgery!"" Well, for a while, they helped fund surgeries. But Months later, those whose payments are past due will be hunted down by The Repo Man.

But aside from that. GeneCo is run by the Largo family. Rotti is the father who is dying of a terminal illness. Pavi is a satistic womanizer and rapist who cuts off women's faces and wears them as masks (his face was badly burned). Luigi is a sadistic killer who will kill anything. And Amber is a surgery addict and a Zydrate-addicted bimbo. But on the Repo Man's family, the Repo Man is Nathan, a man grieving the loss of Marni, his beautiful wife, has a daughter named Shilo, who is confined to a room due to her sickness she inherited from her mother. All of this takes place over the course of one night, the night of the Genetic Opera.

This film is one of the best I've ever seen. In a world of horror copycats and torture-porn flicks, this is refreshing and a great change. It has enough gore to keep horror fans satisfied, and is filled with great fun from beginning to end. And I was surprised at how great Paris Hilton was. For the first time ever, she impressed me!

The entire cast is solid and in sync with each other, artifact of both good acting and superior directing. The narrator is both informative and hilarious, and he helps to tie together the disparate elements of the film.

I almost didn't get it, on the other hand, because of Paris Hilton. I really don't like her.

But within the first ten minutes of the movie my opinion was changed. It only took that long for me to realize that this movie was genuinely GREAT. I already knew that Anthony Stewart Head had a great voice, and I was not let down by him, nor was I let down by anyone else in it. The Graverobber was a great surprise for me, because I didn't know him from anything else but MAN he can sing!

And to comment on what I said earlier about not liking Paris Hilton? This was the perfect role for her. One of her scenes, in fact, made me laugh more than anything else in the entire movie.
