2174189,2,B00067MXHU,Shallow story line. Poor acting. Certainly not worth the money to rent or much less buy.,1407715200,,88,4.5625

2174192,1,B00067MXHU,"Like many a chick flick, the heterosexual couple at first hate each other and then fall in love.  Tia C. has blonde hair meant to make her look white, but why the charade when you're a famous Asian-American actress.  David Chavret has ironed-flat lips.  Unlike George Michael, his 5 o'clock shadow looks nasty and haggard.  This work was simply not enjoyable.  The only plus is the brief male nudity in it.  There are too many quality chick flicks to waste your time on this stinker.",1184889600,,483,4.623529411764705
2174193,1,B00067MXHU,"This has got to be one of the worse ever made. David Charvaet's squeeky voice and lack , actually total lack of acting ability make this a waste of time.",1049155200,3,153,4.133333333333334
2174194,5,B00067MXHU,"If David Charvet is not prince charming... then who is?
This movie captured me from the first minute on Show Time. I have to confess that I am not a fan of Tia Carrere at all... as a matter of fact I wish her role was played by any other! But this is a personal taste, others seem to like her (especially on Relic Hunter) but I don't!
The story is a simple love story... and this what gave this movie a special taste! I mean we had it with the complicated dramas. And for me it was time for a change... for a light story. Whether you read this story in a book, newspaper or even if it happened with a friend of yours you'd still be able to enjoy it and smile! :)
David Charvet has great potentials for a successful future as an actor and a singer! Go ahead and watch this movie! It may not be for keep but at least rent it.",1035936000,7,823,3.934131736526946

2174215,4,B00067MXHU,"Yes, this was a predictable plot and a predictable movie.  I have seen probably 10 movies with a similar concept in the last month; BUT it's not the ending that makes the movie, it's how the writer gets there; and the story was entertaining.  No bad language that I detected.  No explicit sexual content; though there was one instance of implicit sex.  I likes the script and story.  I liked the acting.  The dialog was delivered professionally and the acting went along with what was happening in the story.  It was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it.  Sometimes we don't see the good right next to us because we are not looking for the good but the bad.  If we give people the chance, most will take it to become friends.",1430956800,3,737,4.481203007518797
