6461713,4,B00L1WJG5Q,"Christmas Bounty features Francia Raisa as a former bounty hunter turned elementary school teacher, who needs to heads back home when her past comes back to get her. There, shes reunited with her bounty hunting family, and to her surprise, her bounty hunting ex, played by wrestler Mike The Miz Mizanin. Things get a bit more complicated when her fianc&eacute; arrives and she tries to hide her past and the family business.

Im so glad I chose to watch this.

This is a cute and funny romantic comedy. I loved the pairing of Francia Raisa as Tory Bell and Mike The Miz Mizanin as Mike Mikey Muscles. I could definitely feel chemistry there. I don't know how much acting The Miz has done previously, but I thought he did a great job of course, it doesnt hurt that hes a hottie. The supporting cast definitely added to the laughs.

I liked the premise and it was definitely a hoot in certain scenes especially with their portrayal of a New Jersey family. Yes, it may be a bit predictable, but if you're looking for something fun, light and romantic for the holidays, Id pick this.

Family Friendly: Probably not for the little ones, if you don't want them watching gun fights and sexual innuendos.

Romantic: Definitely. There is a line from Mike, during a club scene, which just made me melt.

Holiday-ish: Hm it was more about the rom-com than the holidays. I think it could have taken place anytime of the year and not lose much of the story.

Rewatch: I will definitely add this to my list of movies to watch again.",1414972800,3,1518,4.538461538461538
6461714,1,B00L1WJG5Q,"As someone who looks forward to the waves of Christmas movies on TV each year and owner of more than 100 Christmas movies, I was hugely disappointed with this movie. I am willing to accept that not every Christmas movie will be a classic and I really like a lot of them that get low reviews, but this is by far one of the worst attempts ever created. I struggled through the first 10 minutes before I gave up on this film, and this is just the latest failure by ABC family in the Christmas movie genre. 25 days of Christmas on ABC family was always something to look forward to each years, but they have gone from 3-4 great movies each season, to 1-2 bombs, so someone new must be running things and I can only hope things are better for 2014. This though was trash in my opinion, but I am sure there is audience somewhere out there.",1410480000,9,833,4.2125

6461729,3,B00L1WJG5Q,"Some Asian Indian-looking Hispanic girl from New Jersey tries to run away from her past by going all the way across the river to Manhattan to be an elementary school teacher. She gets a suit and tie boyfriend from the financial district. Meets the parents. While literally meeting the parents the girl has to go back to NJ as some guy is out of prison that she and her family put in prison as they are bounty hunters. She meets her old flame, a friend or two, etc as they try to apprehend the mobster and his crew.

I have no idea when NJ became this place where nothing but Italian trashy, violent people hail from. I can count many actors/actresses that grew up in NJ and they are as American looking/acting as Apple Pie. I guess things change. But the state might want to rethink this new PR move as portraying your people as looking like prostitutes and talking like morons isn't going to do it to attract a large swath of people. I find that entire genre, if it is a genre, repulsive. If you picked them up and put them in the middle of the Ozarks they would be on an episode of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". It is just tasteless.

Anyway, the female lead is just hideous looking. She is not leading actress material in my opinion. The fiance actor has this HUGE nose and this little teenie tiny hole for a mouth. But out of that little hole comes this annoying old man's voice. Just odd person. Odd choice for a romantic movie. The man who played the dad has this face was as big as the sun and moon combined. Just odd looking. The only eye candy in this movie was the ex-boyfriend. Even the best friend was scary. She looked/acted like a pornography actress. But boy has the guy who played the ex-boyfriend come a long way since the days of Real World where that black girl picked on him as he looked the boy next door (and he let her). Anyway, my point is these people were just freaky weird looking characters. Maybe that was the point. Dunno. Just a big turn off.

The plot though was cute. It is the same one we have seen in these types of movies a gazillion times. It never gets old though.",1451260800,,2099,4.295454545454546
6461730,3,B00L1WJG5Q,"Tory Bell (Francia Raisa) is a teacher who lives out in Manhattan with a boyfriend named James (Will Greenberg) with a secret she's been hiding, she's a former bounty hunter, when she gets a phone call from an ex-convict she captured named Manucci (Aleks Paunovic) causing her to fly home to New Jersey meeting back up with her parents Gale (April Telek) & Hawk (Michael Hanus) & cousin Bones (Scott Patey) to capture him again.  She gets back involved in the family bounty hunting business but runs into various issues such as working with her ex-boyfriend Mike (The Miz) with their friend Liz (Chelan Simmons) letting her know that he hadn't been the same since they broke up due to unresolved issues between the two, dealing with Manucci's associates in his sister Big Donna (Sidika Larbes) & Lepold (Keith Dallas), and her boyfriend James unexpectedly arriving in the wrong place at the wrong time causing everyone to try to hide her past from her now fiance.

This was originally a made for TV movie so it runs for around 75 minutes but was a nice family movie with all the different stories being easy enough for everyone to follow with some comedic moments while also not being so heavily ""Christmas"" themed that you can watch it anytime of the year & it wouldn't feel out of place so it's a family movie that I would recommend to check out.",1447286400,2,1348,4.635983263598327

It is silly but sweet, with some gunfights, and even though you know where it's going, it's a fun trip. The supporting cast is also lots of fun.

8663271,3,B00L1WJG5Q,"Although titled Christmas Bounty, you could watch this any time of year, as other than a scene where the bounty hunter family goes to a Christmas tree lot to find the bad guy and the boyfriend being kept in the dark goes there to pick out a tree, there really isn't anything else Christmas related in this one.  The movie is deliberately cheesy, it's sort of like Saturday morning kids shows, there's guns being fired, and fighting but like WWE wrestling, which the actors come from, no one bleeds, breaks bones or anything like that.  In the opening minutes the main character jumps from an upper floor of a school building onto the roof of a moving four wheel drive, that pretty much sums up the realism your going to see on the screen with this one.

The basic premise of the movie is that a school teacher is meeting the parents of her boyfriend who don't like her much as she's the wrong race and not from the upper class.  Of course they would be horrified if they actually knew she was from New Jersey and used to be a bounty hunter, which the rest of her family still does.  I guess she thinks her boyfriend would be horrified too and break up with her, as she hasn't told him either.  But keeping that secret is likely to come undone, as she has gotten a call from a guy she captured who has just been released from jail taunting her.  She must rush home and warn her family (because she's never heard of a phone).  Of course her fiance has shown her this stalking app he has had installed on each of their phones prior to her running out during the meeting his parents family dinner and he's of course going to use it to get some answers.

It was enjoyable enough to watch once but wasn't really a memorable movie or anything, the acting wasn't brilliant, but it was an originally made for TV.  The teacher didn't really look like the rest of her family though or even the same race.  Could have been adopted I guess.  Would there really be a guy on the planet who would see that fact their girlfriend could not just take care of herself but kick anyone's a, and used to arrest fugitives as something detrimental?",1482105600,,2123,4.3604060913705585

It's funny, romantic, kind of mysterious, and playful. It's just a silly fun time.  And since I'm a big WWE fan, I really appreciate seeing The Miz in his silly role as Jersey bounty hunter.",1480204800,,339,4.435483870967742
