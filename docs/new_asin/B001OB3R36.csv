8330063,3,B001OB3R36,"The first two were boring. They ended too fast and the opponents skills were too much apart.

The 3 fights: Jerry Bohlander vs Fabrio Gurgel, Mark Coleman vs John Bronson, Tank Abbort vs Scott Ferrozo were exciting. Their skills were almost equal and those factors created interesting matches.

The sixth fight was a big disappointment. Mark Coleman was declared the champion because all his opponents were injured and could not fight.",1392854400,,435,5.112676056338028
