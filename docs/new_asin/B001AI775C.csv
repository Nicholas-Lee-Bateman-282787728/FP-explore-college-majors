3451369,4,B001AI775C,"Wings went through some changes in Season 7.  The most obvious was the departure of Thomas Hayden Church as Lowell Mather.  He appears in just one episode where he is written out of the show for the remainder of the series.  He is replaced by a new mechanic named Budd who appears frequently in the first half of the season but less and less in the second half.  Apparently, the producers came to see him as a mistake because he is dropped altogether for Season 8.

Outside of the cast changes already mentioned, Season 7 of Wings stuck to a formula similar to prior seasons and was largely successful.  Joe, Helen, Brian, and Casey all occupy the same house thanks to a fire and the situation was milked for as much as the writers could get out of it.  This year may not be at quite the level that we saw from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings-The-Sixth-Season/dp/B0011NVCAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wings - The Sixth Season</a>, but there are plenty of laughs and it makes for an enjoyable time.",1222646400,18,1046,5.046511627906977
3451370,5,B001AI775C,"Well, what can be said about he best comedy of the 90's?  Nothing, except that Season Seven is, in my opinion, one of the absolute most hilarious seasons in sitcom history.  In particular, the episode with Sandy Cooper (her 3rd appearance on the show), was for me the one of the funniest epidodes I've ever seen.  Sandy has Joe convinced he is completely crazy and what she has in store for him is even nuttier and funnier than her first two appearances.  Poor Joe!  The entire season is awesome! Enjoy to your heart's content or until you can laugh no more!",1222387200,4,558,4.485148514851486
3451371,5,B001AI775C,"you can't beat this combo of writers!  from cheers to wings to frasier, the main plot and ""b"" plots of each episode will feature hilarity while bringing the audience in to love these characters more and more every day.",1221436800,2,218,4.589743589743589
3451372,5,B001AI775C,"This, for me, was the last of the good, watchable Wings.  (The last season totally and completely SUCKED.)  Season 7, after the wedding, coming home from the honeymoon to find the house gone and the rest of the season is pretty much taken up with getting a new house and dealing with how and why Helen's house burned down. If anyone can make burning down a house *funny*, it was done here. I still wonder how, even with the insurance payment, they always seem to have money to throw around on this series.",1215216000,9,505,4.419354838709677

3451374,5,B001AI775C,"As with all the other seasons, Wings is one of the best comedies to be on tv.  Still is hilarious; great to watch them again.",1407974400,,125,4.0
3451375,5,B001AI775C,"It's ""WINGS"". What else need be said. After six seasons they're still in the groove. Surely one of my favoritesw",1406332800,,112,4.65
3451376,5,B001AI775C,"The writing on this show and the acting was really spectacular. Every single one of the cast members were great. They were smart by bringing in different personalities as the show went on, but the core cast never ceases to amaze me. I have recommended this show to anyone who will listen for years now.",1403827200,,302,4.509090909090909
3451377,5,B001AI775C,I have the entire series of WINGS and love to watch them many times over.  It a good family oriented show and would highly recommend.,1390348800,,133,4.32
3451378,5,B001AI775C,I have always enjoyed Wings. Occasionally it is on some TV Channel but I got tired of it coming and going so I'm buying each season.  This was a new DVD in original packaging.  All is well.,1388016000,,189,4.081081081081081
3451379,5,B001AI775C,"Lowell leaves the show to star in an ill-fated sitcom called ""Ned and Stacey"".  He is replaced by mechanic named Bud Bronski who only stars in a handful of episodes before suffering from Chuck Cunningham Syndrome.  Joe and Helen are building a house as Casey and Brian explore casual sex.  The series starts a noticeable decline in quality in this season.  Don't kid yourself, it's still a great season and has some of the funniest single episodes of the entire series.  Season highlights are: ""Death Becomes Him"", Joe and Brian are hired to retrieve the dead body of a wealthy man whose family is an institution on the island.  After fearing the fate of their airline, Joe is scared into pretending to be dead in a casket for an memorial service.  ""Hooker, Line, and Sinker"", Joe and Brian convince Antonio to speak to a beautiful woman at the bar.  After Antonio does well with the woman, she informs the brothers she is a lady of the evening and requires $300.  ""The Lady Vanishes"", Antonio meets a beautiful woman at the terminal.  When she suddenly disappears, Antonio scours every inch of the island to track her down.  Total disclosure, this is my favorite episode of the whole series.  ""The Lyin' King"", when the brothers find out a high school crush is a nude dancer they desperately want to visit the club.  Can Joe go without Helen finding out?  ""Love Overboard"", Casey's husband (played by real-life husband John Ritter) returns to the island to make up.  If you loved Three's Company like I did, this episode is a must-see.  John Ritter is a comic genius.",1383436800,,1568,4.688644688644689
3451380,4,B001AI775C,"Wings was always five star throughout it's run. When it lost the Loyd character , it lost viewers in droves and was then cancelled at the end of this good season. But seven seasons in nothing to sneeze at! And the show is still in reruns as it was a classic show for it's day. This one ties up the story of the flying brothers quite well. And the cast does a good job , with even a few weaker episodes than previous seasons. Still , a weaker wings episodes is still better than most of it's era.  Wings is available in hd on the reelz channel and that's a good thing. The dvd sets look decent but not as good. THis one looks better than the earlier sets as it was not from 1990!. WIngs , needs a reunion show and as most of the actors in it , at this time , have no permanent gigs , that shouldn't be a problem. But with this set you get the final season and it's a good one.",1377475200,,875,3.9157303370786516
3451381,5,B001AI775C,I'TS funny how they can make a comedy out of a little airport on an island. I grew up on Martha's vineyard really enjoy this.,1369267200,,125,4.04
3451382,5,B001AI775C,I own all of the seasons and love them.  The cast of this series clicked from the beginning and as they added characters they all clicked!,1366848000,,138,4.3076923076923075

3451395,5,B001AI775C,"This was packaged well, and shipped timely.  Wings is comedy at its best from the two Hackett brothers to the morose Antonio, all the characters are fun.",1353974400,,153,4.666666666666667
3451396,5,B001AI775C,"Season 7 was as great as all the rest and was happy to add this to my collection.

***SPOILER ALERT***** if you haven't seen do NOT read this section****

I was very sad to see Thomas Haden Church leave but found his final episode very moving especially the end. I felt that the character of ""Bud"" that they brought in to replace him had a lot of potential and hated that the network just kind of faded him out. By the end of the season he is just gone with no explanation. He could have been a cool character.",1351555200,,510,4.141414141414141
3451397,5,B001AI775C,"What can I say about this show? One of my favorite tv shows of all time. Not so much because of the writing, more because of the CHARACTERS. If you've never seen Wings, start with season one and go from there. Love these.",1309564800,,221,4.162790697674419
3451398,4,B001AI775C,"Many say the seventh season showed signs of decay.  I have to disagree.  This was not one of those really hysterial comedies, but this group of actors became part of the family for eight years.  I recommend it, the complete series, for people with a good sense of humor and for people who just want plain good ol' clean fun.  It seems nowadays comedies only work if the characters are mean to one another.  Sorry, I get 'mean' at work, don't want it at home!!!  Sit, laugh, enjoy.",1302825600,,480,4.3977272727272725

3451400,3,B001AI775C,Season seven is up and down on the comedy end.  Like so many shows this far along and losing some of the cast just kind of die.  They where some of the greatest and season seven still has its moments.,1267574400,2,200,3.975
3451401,3,B001AI775C,"Wings is a show I really enjoy and always found funny.  Despite the positive reviews I've seen on season 7, I found this to be the season I enjoyed the least.  I certainly was not laughing out as loud as I was with the previous seasons, and not just because of the absence of Lowell.  I'm keeping it in my library to complete the series, but when I go back to watch episodes of Wings I will more likely pick one of the other seasons.",1253059200,6,433,4.070588235294117
3451402,5,B001AI775C,"I have watched a lot of tv shows and movies over and over, but ""Wings"" takes the prize.  I pretty much have these memorized, but they still make me laugh.  I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I'm not complaining.  I can't believe it's almost time for the last season.  boohoo",1237939200,,276,4.25
3451413,5,B001AI775C,"I am a huge fan of the Wings series.  This is the type of sitcom that created must see t.v. in the mid to late 90's.  Season 7 does not disappoint.  Wings is one of the few series that I watch from Season 1 to the end.  Season 7 includes some of my favorite episodes including the one where Joe has to pretend to be dead while Brian searches for the misplaced body.  I love it!  The loss of Lowell is noticeable, although his replacement does have his comedic moments.  All in all this is a great season, but don't start with this one, you will be completely lost in the story lines.  Start with season 1 and work your way up, you will be glad you did.",1232409600,8,652,4.0390625

3451415,5,B001AI775C,"Every year this series gets a little more goofy and this season is no exception.  Watching the shows always gives me a good laugh. I love the characters; they are well written, and the actors are faithful to the character. I will buy the next season when it comes out. It makes me long for some intelligent, well written, funny sitcoms on tv today.",1226448000,2,348,4.4375
3451416,3,B001AI775C,"Wings is a great show. Although after the wedding, the burning down of both houses and the departure of Thomas Haden Church (Lowell), this show was headed toward its end.  The stories in this season have a different feel to them, and they have almost abandoned the whole airport/airline aspect of the show.

Still a great show and I will definitely be enjoying the last season upon its release.",1226188800,7,394,4.695652173913044

3451420,4,B001AI775C,"Wings-Season 7 is one of the better seasons of Wings.  Wings is not at the caliber of Seinfeld or Will and Grace as far as wit and timing, but it is still an enjoyable and comforting comedy.",1223683200,2,190,4.135135135135135
3451421,3,B001AI775C,"I love the whole Wings series, but in Season 7 after Joe and Helen get married and Lowell leaves, it's not quite as funny.  Lowell was a lovable goofball, but the new guy is just an idiot.  I guess it's no wonder the show canceled in Season 8.",1223251200,11,243,4.041666666666667
