6853712,5,B00Q3FOHGO,"We both loved the music & the show! Thought it was great, but we did not know who she was. We will pre-order the DVD. Great job by Alexandra Shipp. Will look for more of her for sure!",1421798400,2,183,3.8421052631578947

6853717,1,B00Q3FOHGO,This is the WORST representation of who Aaliyah was and what she worked so hard to accomplish in her 7 year career. Please don't waste your time as a consumer. Hopefully her family will release their own movie because this is TRASH,1480204800,3,231,4.523809523809524
6853718,1,B00Q3FOHGO,"If i could give it a half a star, or zero, i would.  This was HORRIBLE! Don't waster your money!  NO family approval, no songs, the characters looked nothing like the real people and they only focused on her and R Kelly.  The producer (you know who- how you doin?)  should be ashamed of herself.",1477526400,3,295,4.3090909090909095
6853719,2,B00Q3FOHGO,"It could have been a really good movie if it had her songs. An Aaliyah Movie without her Music is not an ""Aaliyah Movie"" & not worth the buying. I'm sure BET, MTV, VH1, LMN, OWN any of these can come up with a nice movie with her Music that will honor her legacy and life story.",1477008000,6,278,3.8947368421052633

6853731,1,B00Q3FOHGO,"As an avid Aaliyah fan this was a disgrace to her legacy.  The movie had no music rights, no family approval and the casting choices was quite questionable.  Not to mention that this movie was nothing but an attempt to romanticize her ""relationship"" with R. Kelly.  The only respectful thing this movie had going was that they didn't show what led to her untimely passing.",1446422400,11,372,4.6923076923076925

6853736,1,B00Q3FOHGO,Terrible and a disgrace to Aaliyah's legacy. The makers of this film and actors need to be waterboarded for this s***.,1438905600,2,118,4.666666666666667

6853741,1,B00Q3FOHGO,This movie deserves no stars at all...that's how bad it was ,1433808000,3,60,4.454545454545454
6853742,3,B00Q3FOHGO,"This movie had many things going for it. It had a good look, a good vibe, and Alexandra Shipp portraying Aaliyah. What the movie did not have was the rights to use any of Aaliyahs songs. It must have been a challenge to present a movie about a singer when you cant use the singers songs!  Imagine Ray without Ray Charles songs, or Walk the Line without Johnny Cash songs. For me, this was the major hurdle that held this movie back from its potential.  There were also other distractions: Cle Bennetts portrayal of R Kelly seemed somewhat subdued. Given R Kellys life, he could justify his own bio-pic!  In addition, Missy Elliotts character was totally miscast.

What was really missing for me was any portrayal of the impact Aaliyah had on the music world. I am not familiar with her music, but everything I have read about her conveys how influential her projects were.  I watched this movie hoping to learn about her musical contributions; however, there is no real sense of what set her apart.",1433116800,13,998,4.6158192090395485
6853743,1,B00Q3FOHGO,This movie was awful and doesn't deserve one star. Those giving it 4 or 5 stars obviously didn't know the true story or just like trashy gossip bologna. It was really a waste putting this into production...,1432944000,4,206,4.594594594594595

8690171,1,B00Q3FOHGO,"I don't know why ""Wendy-aka-Wendell"" Williams and Co.even bothered putting this movie together if they couldn't get the music rights or get approval from Aaliyah`s family. This is honestly one of the worst biopics ever made. Aaliyah fans, don't waste your time or money!",1517270400,,270,5.159090909090909
