1900796,5,B0000A1HW7,"My two girls ages 7 and 2 both adore this movie. My two year old has been putting this movie in the VCR every single day for a week now (that is also how long we've had it) and I'm not even tired of watching it. We also have Barbie Nutcracker, and they have seen Rapunzel, but this is their favorite of all 3 movies. The costumes are stunning, special effects, all the pink glitter magic and the luminous fairy queen are absolute eye candy! Which is in part what makes the movie so wonderful. The computer graphics and animation are very well done. The story line - was well executed. Odette, Barbie, the heroine, finds bravery within herself which ultimately defeats Rothbart, the evil sorcerer and saves the Enchanted Forest. How many girls dream of discovering such a magical fairy world which lies hidden behind a waterfall ... We all love the ballet in the movie, such beautiful coreography, we wish there was a little more of it, but it was all balanced out with everything else going on in the story. The music is so wonderful too, consequently, I'll also be looking for an instrumental CD of swan lake.
The little animal friends turn into elves/fairies at sunset (just as Odette turns into a swan) and the porcupine (Ivan - Tommy) and the skunk (""the lovely Carlita"" - Kelley with Black Hair) are just a hoot and their dance numbers are an absolute joy to watch, we just want to join them in the fun! I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all young girls (even grownup ones!) who love Barbie, fairies and magic.",1065571200,10,1522,4.538181818181818
1900797,5,B0000A1HW7,"Barbie becomes Odette in Swan Lake...another gorgeously animated movie that follows Rapunzel and The Nutcracker.  In my opinion, this is the best by far with it's classic storyline, charming characters, and computer generated ballet perfomed by the New York City ballet accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra.  Rapunzel lacked the dancing which I thought was phenomenal in The Nutcracker...I'm so glad they decided to adapt another classic ballet for children.
In this story, Odette wanders into the enchanted forest and is transformed into a swan by Rothbart, an evil sorcerer who wants to defeat the Fairy Queen.  The Queen adapts the spell so that Odette can remain human during the night, but transforms back into a swan in the daytime.  Odette finds that it is up to her to save the Enchanted Forest from Rothbart, but feels that she doesn't have the ability to perform the task.  Of course, there is also a love story as Rothbart's daughter tries to trick Prince Daniel into believing that she's Odette, whom he has fallen deeply in love with.  Will Odette save the Enchanted Forest from Rothbart?  Will Prince Daniel finally get his true love?  It's a story about bravery, self-confidence, and honesty that will charm your Barbie lover to no end.  Highly recommended!",1064880000,11,1280,5.028436018957346

The moral of the story doesn't seem to be the same with this one. The ""bad guys"" were overdone in this movie. The worst part of all is the daughter of Rothbart is ridiculous. She has an annoying laugh that is so unrealistic it makes the writers just look dumb. They try to make her so annoying and bratty that it comes off as them trying too hard. She also has a mullet (???) and it bothers me that Odette is of course a blonde blue eyed beauty but the other girl has dark hair and brown eyes and is supposed to be ""ugly."" I don't like the message that this sends.
Overall I am disappointed in this one.",1419379200,,814,4.1257861635220126

She's OBSESSED with ballet so even though I thoroughly despise every thing Barbie stands for, I had to admit, the movie she received was very well executed in terms of story line, music and cgi. That move had 80% ballet dancing. The description of this movie made it seem like it was going to be similar - and why wouldn't it be, Swan Lake is a ballet! Well, it had one short (2 minute) ballet scene. That's it. SO DISAPPOINTING. In addition, the cgi and storyline were nowhere near the same quality as Barbie in the Pink Shoes. I'm returning this and buying DVDs with real kids learning ballet so she can practice at home.

Most of the characters were well-developed and likeable, but with the exception of Barbie/Odette and Odile which I think needed a bit more depth and character.

The motion-capture performed by NYC dancers were exceptional, but the disappointment was that there was actually very little dancing.

The character models did not seem age-appropriate, it was something for more mature or teen audiences, I would definitely not recommend this as a kids movie, especially young girls who can get the wrong impression about thinness.

The computer rendering of the scenes seemed rather poor for a movie produced in 2003, there was also an major absence of shading/shadows which was very noticeable.",1290729600,,812,5.230769230769231

The story is beautiful. There's suspense and times at which you think all hope is lost.

The producers of this movie splurged on getting Kelsy Grammer, & the LSO to preform, they only had enough budget to use some JR High school kids as a side project, in some thrid world country, to animate this picture, using Comodore 64's, Amigas or hell, maybe even Tandy's!

But besided that, the music, is just splendid, after all, it's the London Symphony Orchestra that's playing the score from P.I. Tchaikosvsky...

Barbie as Swan Lake is a little odd... I gave is four stars because I did not feel it was as good as the others..there are still some questions I am left with after seeing this movie::

WHY WAS EVERYONE SO UGLY IN THIS MOVIE except BARBIE??
Usually in these Barbie movies the supporting characters..even the villians (La Verna of Fairytopia for example) are pretty decent looking.
In this Barbie movie all the characters are not very attractive except Barbie. The Villian is so ugly, Barbie's sister, the Queen, Barbie's friends, people in the village..even the unicorn was so ugly and annoying..Usually her animal friends have pretty long eyelashes and where lots of makeup.
THE THREE OBLIGATORY KELLY DOLLS??
Seems since Barbie is a famous movie star her Brat sister kelly and her friends have to always get in on the scene!
TO MANY COSTUME CHANGES??
Barbie changed outfits so many times in this movie it was hard to keep up!! What was the wings she was wearing at the end??

However, I have to admit I really like to watch it too. It is my favorite animated Barbie movie to date. It is so beatifully done.",1159660800,3,284,3.830508474576271
1901002,5,B0000A1HW7,"I'll admit it. I was skeptical. I rolled my eyes and wondered how a Barbie movie could possibly be entertaining in any way.

But I was wrong. Sure, they're not epic, moving tales of love and excitement, meant to blow away your mind and change your views on life itself. They're little girl movies meant to entertain little girls. In fact, they entertained me, at 18, my mother and to some extent my brothers, as well as my 8-year-old sister. The animation is pure eye-candy; colorful, bright and lush. The acting isn't top notch, but it's pleasant and enjoyable. The characters are mostly adorable. They weren't meant to be anything more than cutesie girl movies. And as a cutesie girl movie, it more than suceeds.

This take of the Swan Lake introduces Odette as, not a princess, but a baker's daughter for which I give them points. Instead of the typical tomboy character who rebels against her parents, Odette is a quiet, shy girl, who loves her father and enjoys working (and dancing) in the bakery. More points for overcoming the new stereotype. She is a reluctant heroine, who thinks herself not up to the task of saving the world, but who prooves herself to have grace under fire. Finally, a girly girl is presented as something ok and not as undesirable. More points awarded.

The villian, wonderfully voiced by Kelsey Gramner, was amusing in his being completely and totally wrapped around his whiny daughter, Odile's finger. The irony was not lost on me; Rothbart perfectly in control of himself and everything at his command.. except his young girl.

The dancing scenes won me over. I was shocked when I heard actual Swan Lake music and actual ballet being performed in front of me. It was beautifully done and fit seemlessly into the movie. A wonderfu way to expose little girls to classical music and dance as an artform. In a world where this sort of thing is considered 'uncool' this was a wonderful surprise.

The hate reviews for this movie are pretty interesting. Apparantly a bunch of young teens didn't like the movie and decided to do a group bashfest. About five hate reviews are nearly identical; they love Bratz, hate this movie, and thought Bratz was 1673819x better than Barbie. Furthermore, the music was called 'not classical' and 'not beautiful', and while they are entitled to their opinion about how good the music was, the movie contained THE Swan Lake score as originally composed.

Barbie of Swan Lake was a wonderful princess tale, pretty and girlish in every way, but by no means soppy or insipid. In a way it shows how you can be a shy girl and yet still be strong and attractive. Like most Barbies the prince is more of a love-interest than a real character, but is well done nonetheless. It is a wonderful movie that girls will love, watch over and over and has only good messages to it. I was stunned by how good these movies were.",1147305600,10,2871,4.675247524752475
1901015,5,B0000A1HW7,"For whatever reason, many young girls have declared jihad against all things Barbie, having been co-opted by the Bratz propaganda bratzkrieg.  This accounts for all the reviews liberally sprinkled with insightful terms such as ""sucks"" and ""Bratz rule.""  If one considers this film on the merits, however, there is much to commend it.

The computerized animation is a visual delight, and quite sophisticated.  The plot is far more complex than in many children's films, and actually may require the viewer to pay attention to follow its twists.  And there is enough sublime music from the distantly-related yet immortal classical work to overcome any other objections.

Kelsey Gramner is no Martin Short when it comes to Barbie villains, but then Short is in a class by himself.  In fact, here we get two villains for the price of one, as Rothbard's chirpy-bird daughter steals the show with several whiny/funny lines.  The two of them provide both comic relief and villainous menace.

My daughters love the dance sequences, often asking me to dance with them during these scenes.  Any movie that elicits that reaction is forever deserving of five stars in my book.  I'll remember these moments long after most kids movies are nestled in some landfill.  Maybe this film will work the same magic for you and your girls.  If it does, it's a bargain at ten times the price.",1137888000,7,1369,4.925764192139738
1901016,5,B0000A1HW7,"Next to the Princess and the Pauper this is the favourite movie in our house for my under 5 yr old girls. It is beautifully animated, generally quite gentle and pastle in colours (so different from Fairytopia and even RApunzel), it has lovely clear messages and great music.

This is the story of Swan Lake retold for Barbie. Here she plays the role of Odette who is the daughter of a baker in a small town. Her sister is a tom-boy who loves riding horses - this sister seems quite superflouous to the story, I have never figured out why she was put in here at all.

Anyway, Odette follows a Unicorn back through a secret entrance to a magic forest. There she saves her but cutting a rope with a jewel which she has found. This turns out to be a magic jewel which only a special chosen one can pick up. It seems it is Odette who is chosen, but before she can do anything she is turned into a Swan by Rothgar who has been terrorising the forest. The Fairy Queen makes a crown out of the jewel to protect her - and changes the spell as best she can so Odette is a swan during the day and girl by night.

Odette is saved by love when a Prince, drawn into the forest by Rothgar to kill the swan, falls in love with her beauty - first as a bird, and then as a girl.

The film departs from the standard Swan lake at this point - there are lots of animals enchanted by Rothgar - but in the end it is love, and friendship which overcome all.  A really nice message.

The dance scene where Rothgar puts an enchantment over his daughter Odile so that everyone thinks she is Odette is quite confusing for my littlies but does not distract from their enjoyment. The dancing is very beautifully done, lovely animation here.

I also loved the colours in this, they tended towards rich pastels rather than the glaring brightness of Rapunzel and Fairytopia

Finally, the music. I loved it - it is of course from the Ballet itself, and it is lovely. I think this is such a nice way for children to be introduced to ballet and to classical music.

A great movie, good messages and fun to watch as a family.",1128384000,18,2088,4.226130653266332

The red light glowing evil power from his eyes is plain SICK! He shoots his sorcery red power lightning to harm others and even turn Barbie/Odette into a Swan.

I thought that the Barbie movies were meant to appeal to smaller children, but I guess that's because I'd never actually sat down and watched one.  I found the characters to be very entertaining!  Lila was a bit humorous with her smart aleck attitude, and the sorcerer's daughter was quite annoying!  I mean my last comment in a good way, since you're supposed to hate the bad guys.  The animation was beautiful, to say the least.  The enchanted forest resembled a land that one could only imagine with its colorfulness, and magic.  The story wasn't completely action-packed, but was enough to inspire me.  My sudden liking of magic thanks to this movie was the reason I started reading Zenda, a fantastic book series about a pre-teen girl with unique powers.  The original story Swan Lake was altered in this movie, but that just makes it more original.

Overall, I would say that if you like Barbie, or slightly simpler forms of magic, you will enjoy this movie.  I would not recommend this movie to those looking for mature, or slightly complicated fantasy movies more on the PG-but-almost-PG13 level.",1101168000,4,1182,4.768472906403941

Kelsey Grammar is the voice of Rothbar, the villian. He does a few scary things, like turn the heroine Odette into a swan, but for the most part, I wouldn't describe it as a scary movie at all. We now own the other Barbie movies as well (Rapunzel and Nutcracker) and this is the least scary of the three.

In the dvd version, you can select ""More Fun"" from the menu, and then select dancing scenes. Barbie narrates as it shows clips from the movie where there's featured ballet dancing.

The characters in this story are very different from it's predicessor.  Odette's friends are hardly likable, the only exception being an amusing troll.  The story line is disjunct and the computer animation (especially the children dancing)is rather poor and awkward.  Gothbart the villian, is voiced wonderfully by Kelsey Grammer and is the only exceptional part of this production.  Odelle (Gothbart's daughter and Odette's antithesis) is simply appauling in concept, pushing offensive, and it is difficult to watch the interaction between the two without feeling somewhat disturbed by the contrast.
  Sadly, I feel that this represents a poor general effort on the part of the creators and am left to wonder why they waisted their time on such a weak project.
  Rapunzel is the way to go.  The story line is well done and truly uplifting.",1076716800,6,971,5.0125
1901027,4,B0000A1HW7,"I bought this video for my princess and Barbie-obsessed 4.5yo daughter, but much to my surprise, everyone in the house enjoys it, including both of my sons (6.5yo and 2yo). Aside from a wonderful turn by Kelsey Grammar (aka Frasier and Stinky Pete) as the bad guy, Rothbart, the original Tchaikovsky music is used to nice effect and played well by the London Symphony Orchestra. The only real downside to the Barbie videos in general is that the computer animation is obviously cheaply done and therefore not anywhere close to being on a par with the animation we've grown accustomed to from Pixar films and the like. Overall, however, I give it a thumbs up and heartily recommend it even if you have only boys. You may find, to your surprise, that they love it.",1074124800,2,762,4.651851851851852
1901028,5,B0000A1HW7,"Firstly, I am not a huge Barbie fan BUT I must admit that movies don't get better than this ....
I bought this for my little girl who is 18 months old .... I am a ballet lover of old and I felt that Swanlake was a great story and after watching Barbie of SwanLake think that the movie was an absolutely beautiful adaptation of the renowned ballet!
The music is fantastic, the messages for your kid/s are great (same as the ballet acutally), and the animation is the best I have seen in any computer-created movie!
I recommend you rent, borrow, or buy this for your kid/s, or yourself ..... I thorougly enjoyed watching this myself ... in fact, truth be told I purchased this for myself!
If you want something a little different from the main stream that is simply spectacular and enjoyable, this is your movie.",1073174400,2,810,4.442953020134228
1901029,5,B0000A1HW7,"Barbie.  I tried to keep her away from my rough and tumble twin girls as long as possible.  I relented two months ago, for their fourth birthday.  I just couldn't squelch their girly-girlishness any longer.  First came the dolls, then the outfits, and now the accessories.  Great-Grandma bought them this dvd, Swan Lake, while we visited for Thanksgiving.  The whole family is pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it is!  It successfully kept the two older brothers and daddy out of the kitchen for a good part of the afternoon!
If you are not freaked out by fantasy, crystals, unicorns, and magic, than I assure you, your little girl will enjoy this dvd.  I think what I really enjoyed about it is that it uses the classical Swan Lake music, rather than Disney-esque songs.  So if I have to listen to it in the background every day for the next week or two (as children are won't to do with a new dvd), it is much more pleasant than listening to inanimate objects singing mind-numbing verse.
The animation is very realistic, especially the dance sequences.  The story is about good vs evil, and courage.  There is humor, beauty, some scariness, and of course, true love.
The additional featurette about girls and music was very interesting.  It features five teenage girls and how music is such a strong part of their lives (two violins, one cello, one harp, and one trumpet).  My girls have now taken to ""performing"" music for us, using a little electronic keyboard and a guitar, which they prop between their legs like a cello.  They even ""rehearse"" prior to performing.  I think a love of music is vitally important in creating a well-rounded soul, and I am thrilled that this Barbie featurette gave them an impetus to actively participate in music-making, rather than just listening.
Again, it was much better than we expected.  I'm beginning to think this Barbie-thing could be a lot of fun.  I'm looking forward to expanding my Barbie horizon.",1070323200,47,1954,4.785074626865671
1901030,4,B0000A1HW7,"I really enjoyed Barbie Swan Lake, but my 4 1/2 year-old ballet-crazy daughter found it too violent and scary.  Those with sensitive children, be careful if they are under 5 or 6 years old.",1070323200,3,189,4.5588235294117645
1901031,4,B0000A1HW7,"I am a ballet teacher and every time I put on Swan Lake music I am amazed that the 3 year olds in my class start dancing around of their own free will and say ""I love this!"" It is because they know it from the Barbie video. So while it doesn't really show them the real classic ballet; they do learn to love the music and will later then enjoy the real ballet. So I think it is a good introduction. I would also recommend the video ""Learn Nutcracker Ballet Dances with Me"" because it is an interactive video for kids to learn and do steps from ballet.",1069632000,5,551,4.064220183486238
1901032,3,B0000A1HW7,"Artisan Entertainment captures the elegance of Swan Lake through three-dimensional digital animation (think Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo vs. Power Puff Girls).  The London Symphony Orchestra performs an enchanting original score to accompany the dance-like movement of the characters.  When young Kelly can't sleep during a camping trip, Barbie shows her the swan constellation Cygnus.  Then Barbie tells her the story of Odette (played by Barbie herself), a magic crystal, and her quest to save the Enchanted Forest. The forest is populated with elves and fairies that were transformed into animals by the hawk-nosed, spindly Rothbart, voiced by Kelsey Grammar. His spoiled daughter Odile's cackling laugh sounds as irritating as it did when actor Maggie Wheeler played Janice on the hit TV show Friends.  Carlita, a skunk with spunk, and Ivan, a befuddled squirrel, provide comic relief.  Computer-generated facial expressions appear lifelike. Sound effects, such as the hooves of Lila the unicorn clopping on cobblestone and the raging waterfall, are convincing.",1067212800,2,1066,5.596273291925466
1901033,5,B0000A1HW7,"...  I liked it better than Rapunzel honestly.  The Tchaikovsky music was beautifully played and accompanied by ballet.  The story was classic and lovely.  I am continually enchanted by the supplemental materials provided on these DVDs, and this was no exception.  There was a documentary following 5 or 6 teenage girls who are musicians and attend Julliard.  I know that my 6 year old worships teenagers, and these girls provided good role models and goals for her to aspire to.  There was also the ballet portion of the Special Features that took each dance and broke it down, naming the dance moves (porte des bras, pirouette, jette, etc.) and describing what is being conveyed by the dance.  When the first video in this series was released two years ago (Nutcracker), I honestly expected it to be junk.  I have been pleasantly surprised, and I am happy to let my little girl watch these movies that promote positive values, self-esteem, and creativity.  I often watch with her, as I find them entertaining as well.",1067212800,2,1019,4.838150289017341
1901034,1,B0000A1HW7,"My daughter gets excited every year when another of these Barbie movies comes out, and until now she had good reason.  I thought the Nutcracker was excellent,  and we all enjoyed Rapunzel as a worthy sequel. However, Swan Lake is certainly the ugly sister of this trio.  Kelsey Grammer's performance is so bad, I think he may have tried to disguise his voice; I wasn't sure it was him until I read the credits at the end.  Maybe he changed his mind but they wouldn't let him out of his contract, I don't know.  But its not just him that drags this film down.  The other movies were able to avoid what I call the ""California meets the Classics"" linguistic disorder by filling in supporting roles with commonwealth-accented players.  Swan Lake discarded this important precedent, and it sounds like the cast was all chosen from the San Fernando Valley.
I guess it doesn't matter, as this will be amongst my daughter's Christmas presents in any event.  But this movie is definitely a stinker; one that this parent will allow his daughter to watch alone.",1067126400,4,1050,4.668478260869565
1901035,5,B0000A1HW7,"This film is not just for young Barbie fans.  It is also for their moms - particularly moms like me who grew up admiring Tchaikovsky's beautiful ""Swan Lake"" ballet. I saw it performed by the Royal Ballet in London as a teenager and have been enraptured with the story eversince.
I purchased this DVD for my 3 year old daughter for us to watch and enjoy together.  My daughter loves it because of the sweet story, playful characters, the dances and, of course, for Barbie! What I enjoyed about this movie is how it captures the spirit of the ballet. Any decent adaptation of ""Swan Lake"" needs to incorporate Tchaikovsky's music into the story and this movie does just that. Add to this the lovely ballet that the characters perform and a plot that stays fairly true to the original (albeit minor changes to make it more G or PG-ish).  In this case, Odette becomes lost in the Enchanted Forest and is captured and transformed into a swan by the evil Rothbart. The fairy queen helps her by changing the spell so that she becomes a swan by day but transforms back to her old self at night.  While wandering the forest the Prince Daniel meets and falls in love with Odette but only through courage and strength can Odette find a way to defeat Rothbart and break the spell.
This is a lovely story that any young girl (and her mother) would enjoy.  The CGI is splendid and the movie is filled with beautiful scenes and landscapes.  The dance sequences are lovely and are lifted almost directly from Tchaikovsky's ballet and the music, of course, is wonderfully incorporated into the film. Highly recommended for Barbie, Swan Lake or young ballet fans, their sisters and their moms!",1065657600,50,1674,4.619528619528619

7995384,5,B0000A1HW7,"Barbie of Swan Lake was my Christmas present in 2003. Unlike the swan princess franchise where there are cheesy characters, cheesy musical numbers, and crocodiles/alligators, this movie adaptation of the ballet is amazing. Odette is raised as a village girl and Daniel needed to pick a bride. This one has a lot more ballet music and dancing. Anytime I watch this and Barbie as the princess and the pauper,  I often kept thinking about back when earlier Barbie movies have big name actors as the voices of their villains. E.G. Tim Curry for Barbie in the nutcracker, Kelsey Grammer for Barbie of Swan Lake, etc.. I liked that trick Rothbart did to Odile where when Daniel sees her, he sees Odette. I give it 5 out of 5 stars!",1522108800,,725,4.62015503875969

The animation on this is definitely the older Barbie animation.  The story is very slow and the villain is a little creepier than my girls are used to for a Barbie movie.  They asked to turn it off before we got 20 minutes in.  Probably my fault for not at least watching the trailer first, and going based on ratings and description.",1505779200,,432,4.417721518987341
