8088748,5,B000BM7Z1Y,"Worth it just for a brief look at Otis Rush!  Also great if you want to learn how to play ""Honky Tonk"".  This really isn't a 5 Star DVD, its probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but everything is relative and I value verey highly a DVD that features Otis Rush talking about the Blues and showing musicians a few things.  Its not as if there is another one out there",1362441600,5,360,4.042253521126761
