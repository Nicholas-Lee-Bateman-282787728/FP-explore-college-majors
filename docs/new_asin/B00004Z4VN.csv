7928203,3,B00004Z4VN,"The ""Twilight Zone"" is my all time favorite TV series and I have the entire DVD series of the show. Of course I have my personal favorites from the series. Volume 36 is an OK volume but not one of the better ones in my opinion. It's not bad mind you, just not one of the better volumes. There are three stories in all. Two half hour ones and one hour episode.

The first episode is titled ""The Chaser"". Starring George Grizzard and Patricia Barry it is about a man who is madly in love with a woman who wouldn't give him the time of the day even if it meant saving his life. Wanting nothing more then the love of his life to love him the man goes to see an expert in elixirs, potions and spells. For a price the expert gives the man a surefire potion that will make this woman go crazy for him. Of course this IS the Zone so there is one problem. The potion works too well. Once under his spell the woman who wouldn't give the man the time of day before is now spending all her time hovering over him. He can't even walk out of the room for a minute without her worrying how he is and when he will be back. It all becomes too much for the man. The problem with this episode is it is a little too predicable. Of course the man goes back to the expert for help and wouldn't you know it, the expert has an antidote. John McIntire is the best part of this story as the expert. He plays his role very well and it is his performance that makes it worthwhile to watch this.

Next up is ""The Rip Van Winkle Caper"". This is an interesting episode about four men who hatch a plan to steal a load of gold bullion. Then to avoid the Heat and get away with the heist they go to a cave with the gold and go into suspended animation planned for 100 years. The idea is when they wake up in 100 years the robbery will have been forgotten and they will have all that gold to spend as they wish. Problem here is that 100 years from now the world and what it values has greatly changed. The stars of this episode include two outstanding actors, Oscar Beregi, who had appeared previously in the TZ episode ""Death's Head Revisited"", and Simon Oakland who had appeared in the famous episode ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"". As with ""The Chaser"" I find this episode a little too predicable but it is still worth watching because of the fine acting by Oakland and Beregi.

The last story on this volume is an hour episode from the 4th season, ""The New Exhibit"". This is the best of the three shows and certainly the creepiest. It stars Martin Balsam as Martin Senescu who works at a wax museum taking care of the exhibits, especially the section with all the wax figures of murderers. When Martin is given the news that the Wax Museum is closing down he gets his boss to agree to let him take the wax figures of the murderers and continue to look after them in his basement at home. It is clear Martin is obsessed with figures. They are like real people to him who need his help and care. It makes things difficult at first for Martin's wife to have these wax figures down in the basement but things soon turn for the worst. For the worst as in deadly. This is one of the better episodes from the fourth season of ""Twilight Zone"" and makes getting this volume worthwhile.

Of course for the serious fan of the show you will want to get this DVD for your library. For the more casual fan or someone who has never seen the show before this could be still a good volume to get. As I said earlier in this review this is not a bad volume but there are better ones in the series you could get to help introduce you better to this excellent series.",1423008000,,3623,4.149359886201991
7928204,5,B00004Z4VN,"The Twilight Zone Series are my favorites Videos Series. I do no t like the live episodes that be included in some of the twilight zones series. Would recommend, I like watching them on the weekends and definitely when it is cold and raining outside. Got them from Amazon when they were $4.99 per DVD. Thank You.",1387324800,,312,4.491228070175438
7928205,5,B00004Z4VN,"Elixirs, potions, whimsical spells, unearthly pacts with ethereal folk and the like, have often conjured up interesting storylines in the TWILIGHT ZONE. ""The Chaser"" is no exception, though in a much lighter vein. George Grizzard is perfect as the scorned lover falling for a very indifferent pillar of pulchritude, Patricia Barry via the assistance of John McIntire. Curious results found her.

""The Rip Van Winkle Caper"" is one of those TWILIGHT ZONE episodes that gets constant play on the perennial run of holiday Twilight Zone marathons. Still it is fun to watch this tale of greed and cunning deception as criminal mastermind played, by Oscar Beregi, and his coldblooded partner, played by Simon Oakland, steal a treasure trove of gold bullion.  Going into suspended animation for a hundred years they figure nobody will ever connect them with the crime.  Inflation comes in many flavors. There is much more than the inflation of their egos that comes into play here.

""The New Exhibit"" from the fourth season of the TWILIGHT ZONE is visually memorable for its strange cast of characters, wax figures of historically infamous killers on display from the wax museum's murderer's row exhibit. The museum is planned to close down and the befuddled museum curator played by Martin Balsam lets his obsession for these figures save them in the confines of his basement. The wax figures, and the persona of the murders who inspired their likenesses, literally haunt him or is it curator Balsam's unconscious mind that begins to bring unmentionable deeds to reality once again? This episode is beyond haunting in scope with its thought provoking eerie premise of the physical and the metaphysical capabilities of the mind gone awry.  This episode plays out in a rather desiccated and unassuming manner, but once again it is the shadowy visual pure cinematic aspects that leave an impression on the viewer. That has been something the TWILIGHT ZONE has indelibly captured for its viewers for all time.",1335312000,,1998,5.097859327217125
7928206,5,B00004Z4VN,"""As a result, the episode lacks the slick elegance and grim humor that marked Beaumont's best work, but it is nevertheless funny.""

Funny? Who does this bozo think he is? This is the best of the best. The New Exhibit still give me chills. It is a master work.",1127001600,4,259,4.285714285714286
7928207,5,B00004Z4VN,"""The New Exhibit"" completely freaked my mom and I out! When we bought our new house, we didn't want a basement because of it.

:-P

Seriously though, it was very freaky, well acted, and well made. I have loved most of the Twilight Zones and this one was one of the best!",1120348800,,270,4.173076923076923
7928208,5,B00004Z4VN,"""The New Exhibit,"" by Charles Beaumont, is my favorite episode on this DVD.  The dark, psychological script is typical of Beaumont's work for THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Gentle Martin Lombard Senesceu (Martin Balsam) is the avid curator of the ""Murderer's Row"" exhibit at Ferguson's Wax Museum.  Trouble starts when Senesceu, upon learning that the museum will soon be abandoned, buys the life-size figures of such legendary murderers as Jack the Ripper, Albert W. Hicks, and Henri Landru and stores them in his basement.  In time, Senesceu becomes so attached to his ""friends"" that he even begins to guide them with his own will.  This is the perfect role for Balsam (who had previously played the detective in Hitchcock's PSYCHO), with his unassuming manner and intense eyes; his performance is a tour de force, from the quietly eerie opening scene in which one can see the first glimmerings of Senesceu's madness, to the explosive climax.  ""The New Exhibit"" also boasts an excellent supporting cast -- including Will Kuluva as the kindly Mr. Ferguson and Maggie Mahoney as Senesceu's meek wife, Emma - and a musical score that effectively suggests the deterioration of Senesceu's reason.  The hour-long episode unfolds at a slow pace, enhancing the suspense.  ""The New Exhibit"" is a masterful production that becomes more fascinating with repeated viewings.  I recommend it!",1099872000,,1369,5.1863636363636365
