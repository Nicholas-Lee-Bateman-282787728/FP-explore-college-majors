8328942,2,B001O2SH1W,"This four-DVD set includes DVD-R copies of ""Made for Each Other"" (1939), ""Nothing Sacred"" (1937), ""The Racketeer"" (1929) and ""Swing High, Swing Low"" (1937).  (It is important to note that DVD-R videos are produced cheaply by being burned on demand, rather than pressed like major studio releases available in retail stores.)  At any rate, the copyrights on each of these films expired long ago, allowing anyone - and everyone! - to issue them on home video.  Over the years, as copies of copies of copies have been used as source prints, the audio and video quality of these films have diminished significantly, to the point that some companies' releases are virtually unwatchable.

In the case of the Lombard selections offered here, ""Made for Each Other"", a sentimental drama co-starring James Stewart, was given a separate DVD release a few years ago by MGM/UA, the company who owned the original rights to the film.  That DVD was remastered from elements in their vaults, and was the highest quality edition of the film we're ever likely to be offered.  I strongly recommend you seek out a copy of that particular release if you wish to add this film to your library.

Of the three remaining features, ""Nothing Sacred"", which teams Lombard with Fredric March, is a bona fide screwball comedy classic originally filmed in Technicolor.  Directed by William A. Wellman, it contains one of Lombard's finest performances.  However, ""The Racketeer"", a primitive talkie featuring Lombard as the nominal leading lady, is nothing special; and ""Swing High, Swing Low"", a dramatic musical co-starring Fred MacMurray, is one of the few misfires Lombard made in her prime.  Of this trio, only ""Nothing Sacred"" is worth adding to your collection, and the price of this set cannot be justified by that one film alone; better to purchase a pressed copy separately.",1253404800,49,1852,5.022875816993464
