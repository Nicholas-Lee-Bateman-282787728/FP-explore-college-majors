7799905,5,159803202X,"I've homeschooled our son his entire life and we use Great Courses for a lot of his formal learning. He especially loves the music courses, and was eager to start this one (along with Robert Greenberg's Music as a Mirror of History). He loves it, especially since he already had some ""old fashioned"" recordings--and performed in two Music Theater shows (Mary Poppins and Shrek the Musical). This is one of The Great Courses older video lecture series, but in some ways, I like them better since they lack all the changing camera angles (which are getting a bit irritating in some of the newer ones) and (at times) distracting background props. Highly recommended if you want to know the history of early American music in general (e.g. Minstrel Shows and Tin Pan Alley), but especially the birth of Broadway.",1493596800,4,808,4.820143884892087

7799910,5,159803202X,"I usually purchase my Great Courses  from that company.  This one on Amazon was too good to pass up.  It was new.  It was shipped in a very timely manner.  I will buy other material from this Amazon partner without hesitation.  The course was a present for my wife.  We are watching it together.  Bill Messenger is a wonderful instructor and an even better pianist.  So, feel comfortable buying from this vendor.  And, buy as many of the Great Courses DVD's as you can find.  Bill gates for instance may have the whole ""library' from them.  I am at about 20 courses and will buy more; thus, I will seek this vendor out to make sure I am getting the best price.",1417219200,4,660,4.319672131147541
