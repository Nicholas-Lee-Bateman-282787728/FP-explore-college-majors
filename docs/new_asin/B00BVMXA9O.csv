8574534,5,B00BVMXA9O,This is a very well done show. The story develops and grabs you! If you see the first few episodes you will be hooked. The plot takes some interesting twists and turns and the characters develop right along with the plot. When the episode ends you want more. The production is outstanding. The cast is sharp and it's well written and staged. It's on a roll right and I think they have the horsepower to keep it rolling. Try it you'll like it.,1424304000,,442,4.337349397590361
