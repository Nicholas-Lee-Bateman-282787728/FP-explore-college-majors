328050,5,6301408926,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I happened to be browsing through the foreign film DVD's and pulled out Salaam Bombay by surprise.  I love this film!  This is my favorite film in the whole world and in my opinion one of the best films ever made.  After searching for such a long time for this film in which I finally found one used copy on VHS, having this film on DVD is a reale prize.  Not only do you get the film itself and the quality of the picture is fantastic, but you get so many special features.  A major highlight of this DVD is that you get special features with several of the actors that acted in the film.  The features present recent interviews with Shafiq Syed the lead character in the film as well as with the other actors.  These feastures are nice because you see the child actors in what they look like now and what became of their lives.  You also get footage on a brief history on how the actors were recruited off the streets and the making of the film.  The features also present footage with director Mira Nair and other production crew of the film.  This is a really great film and the way Mira Nair shot and directed the film was very clever.  This film has  a documentary type quality to it and filming was done entirely on the streets of Mumbai(Bombay)so you get an upclose reality of what some of the streets of Bombay look like and the lives of the poor and the street children.  This is an excellent film and I am grateful to have this DVD, may favorite film of all time!",1050192000,20,1506,4.242105263157895
328052,5,6301408926,"This is a superb film that gives the viewer a bird's-eye view into the plight of India's urban street children. It is done through the experience of young Krishna, an illiterate, country bumpkin of a boy, who is abandoned by his mother at a circus and told not to come home until he has five hundred rupees for having broken something that belonged to his brother. While Krishna is on an errand, the circus packs up and leaves town, and he is left alone to fend for himself.
Krishna uses his last few rupees to travel to a city, which by luck of the draw turns out to be Bombay. Thrust into the life of the street children of Bombay, living among the pimps, hustlers, drug addicts, prostitutes, and throw away children that proliferate in India's urban settlements, a modern day jungle, Krishna struggles to survive. His resourcefulness holds him in good stead. He quickly develops some street smarts and forms attachments. He struggles to earn and save money, so that he can return home to his mother and the family whom he misses, only to be duped in the end by one in whom he had trusted. His story breaks one's heart, as he learns some hard lessons in life.
This is a gritty look into the underbelly and plight of Bombay's poor street children, who call the gutters of its filthy urban streets home. It is filled with the sights and sounds of this urban nightmare. An Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, this highly acclaimed film allows the viewer a peek at another culture, only to find that basic human needs and desires are universal.",1041638400,69,1560,4.575
328053,5,6301408926,"This was my introduction to Mira Nair.  I assumed it was her first full-length feature.  She takes you into the streets of Bombay through the eyes of homeless children.  It is kind of an ""Oliver Twist"" in India, but Nair provides a gritty perspective that has been lacking in her films since her international debut.  The camera work is fantastic.  You really get the sense of the teaming masses of people and the vulnerbility of these children.  The Fagan-like overlord of this brood feels real, making it seem like Mira did her research.",1040342400,26,539,4.741935483870968

328110,5,6301408926,"A film I did not expect to hit me as it did, `Salaam Bombay' is a small yet impressive feature that details a tragic slice of culture we may not be wholly aware of.  Mira Nair directs her debut feature with sincerity and passion and drags out of every frame the angst, grit and honesty needed to compel each and every viewer, not just those directly affected by the film's core focus.

The film follows a young boy named Krishna who is sent off into the world on his own at the ripe old age of eleven by his mother after he breaks something belonging to his brother and costing 500 rupees.  He is told not to come home until he has the money to pay for it.  Instead of joining the circus, Krishna flees to Bombay where he joins a gang of homeless children and comes under the wing of a drug addicted man who befriends Krishna.  Working for mere pennies, Krishna is saving so that he can go home, but the people that come in and out of his life threaten his foreseeable future.

What Mira Nair does here is remarkable; giving us such a straightforward and honest look at the lives lived by those on the streets.  Taking these characters and making them feel hardened and true, we can feel them under our skin.  Whether they are prostitutes, pimps, addicts, dealers or the children caught in their wake, these people are real people (most of the extras and even the film's star were from the streets) and their fragility seeps into every frame.  It is impossible to not be moved by this tremendous film, filled to the brim with social relevance no matter what side of the world you're from.",1376352000,,1588,4.392491467576792

328113,5,6301408926,"I think many people have already reviewed Mira Nair's wonderful movie and it touches the heart in ways that much more scripted films about India don't. But equally moving are the short narratives by and about the actors themselves that are included in the extra features. Made about ten years after the film itself, they are moving vignettes about the impact the film and its makers had on a community of young people in urban Bombay (Mumbai). Quite stunning!",1349481600,2,459,4.822784810126582
328114,5,6301408926,"Note: The film is presented in Hindi with English, Spanish and French subtitles.

The 1998 film `Salaam Bombay' weaves a heartbreaking tale that is lived out everyday by many children living in the alleys and sidewalks of Bombay. They do what they must to stay alive as they move amongst drug addicts and dealers, pimps and prostitutes and anyone else who might wish to exploit them.

Director Mira Nair does a masterful job at capturing the angst, loneliness, and loss of innocence of those referred to as ""the flowers that never open"". How appropriate, and sad but true. These are lives without hopes and dreams, their fate is nothing more than a struggle for survival. She should also be commended for not sugar coating the plight of the disenfranchised youth by wrapping up the storyline in a happy ending to lighten the overall mood of the film and make it more commercial. It's obvious she had a message to deliver and I congratulate her on her success.

If there is any fault with this film it might be found in what I call the watch-ability factor. I liked the film and appreciate the message but I'm not sure I'd care for many additional viewings. Still, it's a quality film from beginning and end and deserves to be viewed by as many as possible.",1305158400,,1256,4.623318385650224

A poor street boy tries to take care of those around him including a drug addict, prostitute, a virgin being primed for prostitution and a young daughter of a prostitute.  He attempts to survive on slave wages and defend people he cares about against cruel people.  Time spent in a state institution shows how little the government feels for these kids and how poorly they advocate for the most vulnerable citizens.",1297036800,3,468,4.753086419753086
328116,5,6301408926,"The actors in this movie make you believe it really happened. The child actors in this movie turn in performances that make some Adult Acadamy Award winners look amateur. I could only compare this to one other movie, Midnight Express. When you finish watching this movie you are a changed person. And to the person who gave one star, they completely missed the point. Yes there are pimps, and whores, and child abuse, but I believe the movie is very human in nature. My 2 cents. Everybody should see  it at least one time.",1295568000,3,522,4.553191489361702

Unimpressive and not of a high artistic quality. I would only recommend it to kill time, if you have lots of it, as you will be spending 15 minutes trying to remove the DVD and then almost 2 hours watching this mediocre movie. So, to open the DVD I had to destroy the entire packaging down to removal of the cover. It was sealed in two layers of plastic and to remove the THREE (3) security device warning stickers I had to completely destroy and remove the hard plastic that holds the colourful (yes, it's the correct spelling) ""booklet sheet"" with picture and info.",1268179200,,714,4.5859375
328168,4,6301408926,"I purchased this movie because my high school seniors had just finished the novel Nectar in a Sieve, and I wanted to give them some visuals regarding the poverty in India; it's so hard for us to picture.  I found this movie, and previewed it, wondering if my college prep class would get anything out of it, but they were fascinated! Salaam Bombay is a VERY different type of filmmaking from what they usually see, and they noticed the long, lingering shots; the muted color palate; and the untutored acting of the cast. I would have loved to have had more information for them about Indian culture, so I could have answered some of their more difficult questions, but I found what I could on the web.",1267315200,,701,4.519685039370079
328169,5,6301408926,"I would call this film a docudrama. The screenplay is like a documentary but it feels like a real life drama. It is SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE without the millionaire. The entire film is shot on location in the slums of Bombay (now Mumbai) and it feels like you're right there with all the filth, the squalor and the mobs of people. The filmmakers also used real street children for the film. Krishna, an 11 year old boy, has been sent by his mother to work in the circus to earn money. One day, the circus leaves without him and he finds his way to the nearest 'big town', Bombay. There we meet the other main characters, street children, pimps, druggies and prostitutes. In their own way, they stick together and fight to survive. When they try to earn money honestly, the employers take advantage of them, knowing they have no one to defend them. Others give up on honest wages and turn to crime and drugs to survive. But they are all real people and have a story and that's the strength of this movie. You really feel like you have entered into the lives of these people and walked with them in their journey, however short and difficult it may be. Krishna's only goal is to make 500 rupees to take home, a modest goal for most people, but a huge obstacle in that environment. While there are plenty of depressing moments in the film, there is also hope, that with the right kind of guidance and opportunity, these are bright and resourceful children who would be successful in legitimate society if they were given a chance. The sad truth is that very few of them will have that life changing opportunity. There are millions of street children in India and around the world. Many of them just waiting for a sponsor to get them out of the cycle of poverty and crime through organizations that are doing a great work of love and compassion. One of the outstanding ones is COMPASSION INTERNATIONAL. If you watch the film, and I highly recommend it, don't stop there, get involved in making a difference. It changes our lives, too.

328170,5,6301408926,"Having seen most of director, Mira Nair's other films, I felt I was long overdue for this one, and I WAS! I find it hard to believe that she was only 30 years old when she directed this very powerful film. Of course, location was important in its impact on the viewer, but it took me several days for the visual force of this film to leave my mind. Actually, I watched it again, a week later, and found it all the more touching and overwhelming in how it depicts an amazing culture and the more amazing street children of Bombay. Nair brings a huge sensitivity and compassion to her subject matter, and while I wish I had seen it sooner, I am grateful that I have at least seen it now, and will again, many times in the future. The message is clear: we are all one people, one heart, one blood, and we must all take care of one another, AND this planet, or we will ALL perish. An extraordinary experience.

328173,5,6301408926,It is a tear jerker and a film everyone should watch at least once.  A very powerful message.  Walk away happy knowing the director adopted one of the homeless boys in real life and brought him up in the United States.,1210291200,2,218,4.2926829268292686
328174,5,6301408926,"In much of the movie, it doesn't seem like they're acting, which is to say the performances are VERY believable.  Some points in the story, however, seemed less than believable.  Krishna stealing food while he's serving guests at a wedding - putting them in his shirt and no one giving a second glance?  The boss not noticing them in his T-shirt when giving him his pay?

Or what about the little girl being sent to the ""prison"" camp?  Orphanage?  I found it hard to believe that her mother couldn't get her back, even though she was a prostitute (on the other hand, wackier things HAVE gone down in India - for another riveting story which details more than a few, check out the book ""A Fine Balance"").

The scenes where Krishna and the little girl are doing all they can to help his junkie friend get his ""medicine"" - powerful.  The ending seemed a bit drastic, though the final shots spoke volumes without saying a word.  I'd give this movie 4.5 stars.  Well-worth watching, especially if you've got a taste for gritty street movies.  It doesn't get much grittier than Bombay.  In fact this is a beautiful movie in spite of its dark theme.",1208131200,3,1142,4.544117647058823
328176,5,6301408926,"Former documentarist Mira Nair's angry, disconsolate, and deeply moving drama about poverty and child homelessness in India was shot on location and stars a cast of non-actors the director recruited from Bombay slums. Like De Sica and other Italian neorealists, Nair focuses with unblinking tenderness on the blighted lives of her protagonists, juxtaposing Krishna's squalid existence with the lush extravagance of the Bollywood musicals he so enjoys. Great performances, affecting imagery, and a heartbreaking plotline deservedly won ""Salaam"" worldwide acclaim.",1183939200,5,562,6.0375

The fact that it's a docu-drama makes it all the more watchable - you know a lot of the children are really street kids in India, not trained actors.  The kids' innocence, trust, devilishness, loyalty, and resilience will break your heart.  The special features also reveal plenty of interesting, amusing and heartwarming titbits.  I've already watched it twice, and I'll defintely watch it again, if only just to remind myself that people can do so much with so little at hand.",1183420800,2,543,4.74468085106383

328209,5,6301408926,"Mira Nair shows the realities of living on the streets in Bombay where children sleep under bridges and sell tea to the prostitutes in brothels as they try to earn money to live from day to day ... Primarily, the film revolves around Krishna, a young boy of 11 years, who left his village to work on the streets of Bombay to earn 500 rupees to pay back his brother, whose bicycle he destroyed. He becomes part of a group of kids who hang out together and look out for one another ... They associate with drug dealers and prostitutes. While the film does show how drugs can destroy lives and how young innocent girls are lured into prostitution there is also a truthfulness and innocence which is conveyed ... The film depicts how the kids survive amidst poverty and how they manage to create a sustainable lifestyle with some semblance of happiness and a wonder for life despite having next to nothing in a material sense.

One of the best extra features on this DVD is the commentary by the director. Mira Nair provides insights into how many of the unique scenes were shot. She discusses particular angles and views used by the camera to capture the pure honesty of this lifestyle. She also describes difficulties encountered and how they were resolved, the major one was meeting the budget, the other was was getting big name actors and actresses for the key roles. Fortunately the subject matter was of such importance, a large British studio Filfour agreed to help fund the project if Ms Nair could raise 51% of the budget herself. Another plus was, the subject of the film was deemed a ""governement film"" and therefore she received funds as well as access to areas which otherwise would be denied, such as the children's home where street kids were taken after arrested. Ms Nair managed to get a popular male stage actor who had never done films to play one of the lead roles and to her delight, he has since become one of India's most famous leading male film actors. She also snared a popular female television soap opera star to play the female lead ...

One of the most unusual but appealing elements in this film is how Ms Nair used actual street children to be the key actors in the film. She  held auditions and made selections then held seven week long workshops where they learned their parts via pictures of scenes which they memorized. Another captivating aspect of this film is how real streets with shop keepers and shoppers were filmed along with the real train station and the natural activities which fit the storyline of the film. This film is a magnificent study of a way of life that few people can imagine but it is all too common in poverty stricken areas of the world. Through this film, Mira Nair has brought the attention of the world to the plight of homeless children in India. She has made a great contribution to improving their lives on many levels. Due to her efforts, trusts have been established in Bombay and other major cities to educate and assist these children. The film itself is a mix of documentary and fiction which captures the intimate details of their reality in vivid color, detail, and honesty. This is a most highly recommended film.

328210,5,6301408926,"Salaam Bombay, the critically acclaimed, award-winning film debut, for director and producer, Mira Nair, lives on as a timeless ode to the poverty, hopelessness and tragedy of young street kids, and other residents of the ghettos of Bombay (now Mumbai), India.  Nair clearly did her research, for this film, manages to bring out stunningly powerful acting in her young actors (particularly, the lead actor, Shafiq Sayed, as Krishna), and leaves us with haunting and cautionary imagery of the sad reality of street life.

Krishna is a young, uneducated Indian boy, from a small village, who ventures out into Bombay, via train, when he must repay 500 rupees to his family, for reasons that aren't clear to us.  He ends up in the one of the poorest, most desolate sections of town, amongst the street urchins and prostitutes.  What start out as a transitional living space, for him, and lifestyle (as he makes his money, selling chai), becomes all the more permanent and--ultimately--impossible.  He encounters Chillum, a drugdealer he befriends, who starts out as an ally, but whose character and relationship to him changes overtime.  He also meets Manju, the daughter of a prostitute, so young and, yet, already so exposed to the darker side of life.

As the film progresses, we forget that these children are acting, and this is a recreation of real-life events.  It is amazing, thought-provoking and ultimately heartbreaking......This was only the beginning, for Nair, who has gone on to have a remarkable and brilliant body of work...",1133136000,9,1538,5.099601593625498

328212,5,6301408926,"""Salaam Bombay"" is one of those rare pictures that sets out to make a statement and then goes and does so convincingly.  The audience is not lectured to but, rather, given the story of a young (pre-teen) Indian boy.  He is a very likeable lad and we take an immediate interest in his well-being.  He seems to do all the right things while finding himself in all the wrong circumstances.  Even though he finds himself among the unsavory of society there is still a loose but visible structure for him to hang onto.  Unfortunately, a key element of the story is the way he continues to become seperated from those he trusts and depends on.  It reinforces the vulneralibility of our young waif.  The ending to the movie is both outstanding and heartbreaking.  It makes the statement of the tragedy of abandoned children in metropolitan India.

The acting in ""Salaam Bombay"" is very good and the juvenile actors hold up their end of the movie.  Despite the apparently sour theme, the movie moves along quite well and is entertaining throughout.  I watched it with my 12 year old son.  Some of the language and situations were a bit ""mature"" but he was intrigued with the plight of a young boy his age and bothered by the outcome in a way that, I hope, enabled him to appreciate our lives here.  This is a movie worth watching.",1115596800,13,1322,4.5508474576271185
328213,5,6301408926,"Wow, what a tremendous story of innocence lost, of the anonymity of the powerless poor in the big city, and of the global theme of vices that trap such lost souls and suck them dry.  This is a monumental film that touched me on so many levels that I can't put it all into words.

Almost the entire film takes place on the streets of Bombay, far from the ""Bollywood"" silliness of musical melodrama that we in the US usually associate with Indian cinema.  These are runaways, prostitutes, junkies, and thieves, but director Mira Nair refuses to treat any of them as props or cliches, showing them as nothing less than fully fleshed human beings.  The lead character is an innocent little boy who finds himself thrust into this world, and he becomes closest to two equally innocent young girls who are also on the verge of being swallowed up by the filth around them.  Their journey through these few weeks is heartbreaking and chilling, and the ending will stay with you for quite some time.

Mira Nair has gone on to direct several feature films, including Indian-American productions like ""Mississippi Masala"" with Denzel Washington, but this is far more realized than that one, partly because the characters are more real and partly because the story is much more perfectly and completely told.  In ""Salaam Bombay!"" the actors are mostly street people, several of them so malnourished it hurts to look at them.  The realism of the players reflects the unblinking realism of the story, ultimately condemning the situation while celebrating the humanity of the people involved.

This film should be required viewing for anyone who says they like movies.",1108339200,18,1652,4.871428571428571

It is very difficult to differentiate between the act and the real thing because so many ""ordinary"" people were used in the making of this movie. But the people themselves are anything but ordinary. They need to be extraordinary in order to survive their poverty-stricken conditions. This movie is about the survival of life for these people. Every day brings new challenges, primarily seen through the eyes of the boy, Krishna. You want to help him but all you can do is watch. And sometimes, cry. You won't view your life the same way again after seeing this profound movie. The scenes will stay with you.

7811551,5,6301408926,"Great film of the underbelly of Indian urban society.  Children abandoned by their families attempt to eek out an existence on the filthy streets of Bombay.  Other children--slaves--are purchased by the owners of brothels to be used as valuable virgins and, later, as common whores.  Children, abandoned by their own families, attempt to establish ties with other children and sometimes with the corrupt adults around them.  There is crime, drug abuse, hunger and sometimes death.

Of course, this film could have been made in almost any 'Third World' city.  Unfortunately, it could have been made in numerous European and American cities.  How many runaway childen in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and many other places are identified and picked up by pimps, 'befriended' and turned into female and male prostitutesproperty?  And we think that slavery ended 150 years ago.  No it didn't.",1446076800,,889,5.204225352112676
7811552,5,6301408926,Just saw this movie on TCM. What a great movie. Very sad. Fantastic acting. There wasn't a bad actor in the bunch. I've never been to India but I sure felt like I was there. Lots of squalor but a beautiful film. I was so immersed in the movie I didn't even realize I was reading the subtitles.,1445904000,,293,4.068965517241379

7811556,3,6301408926,"The Jains, the Hindus, the Sikhs all practice such consideration in their daily life against harming creatures, how could such a country be cruel to the Nepalese girls?  When Chinese cluelessly demand that Sikh basketball players remove their turbans, the visiting athletes sweetly did so because they know that China is ignorant and doesn't know any better - they don't react violently or have terrorist knife attacks justified by China's behavior.

Maybe this is about something else because Western media never condemns India or connects this to the dominance of India in Nepalese politics (Manisha Koirala came to my attention thanks to Dil Se) or speculates how  ongoing trafficking of Nepalese girls is destroying the future of the ethnicity and the faces of Nepal are becoming deeper featured and more Indian since the time of this movie.

Also the brothels in documentaries look like torture chambes, very dungeonlike.  It seems unreal but international media other than not wondering WHY Indians would traffick Nepal are reporting unquestioningly the absolute victimization of the Nepalese girls unlike the tempered coverage of the Comfort Women but there is no way that Western media is proJapan on the matter of the Comfort Women so they are editting themselves for another reason.",1406678400,,1292,5.252427184466019
