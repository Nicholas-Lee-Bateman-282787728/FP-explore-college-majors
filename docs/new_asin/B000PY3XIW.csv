8193754,5,B000PY3XIW,I am a big V.Price fan. The price was great. I would love to eventually start a video library of all all his works.,1365724800,,115,3.8333333333333335
8193755,3,B000PY3XIW,"As other reviewers have said, the version of ""The Bat"" on the DVD is the wrong one- no Vincent Price. The other two are semi-okay quality, but I've seen better versions of VP movies. I would recommend finding another version!",1275696000,,225,4.65
8193756,3,B000PY3XIW,"There are three films on this disk, two with Vincent Price, (""House On Haunted Hill"" And ""The Last Man On Earth""). The third film is the silent version of ""The Bat"", NOT with Vincent Price. This mix up did not bother me since I did not have the silent version and I think it is better than the remake.

The main problem with this ""collection"" is the transfer. It says on the cover that the films have been ""Re-Mastered for Best Possible Picture Quality"". This is not true. This is in fact one of the worst transfer I have seen, both regarding the sound and picture. The silent film has just a random classical music, which usually does not fit to the action in the film.

All of these films are good and the DVD does not cost much, so if you don't care about transfer then buy it. I for one will be buying all of these films again, in a better transfer.",1244937600,18,853,4.195121951219512
8193757,3,B000PY3XIW,"FYI, this compilation contains ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""The Last Man on Earth"", and ""The Bat"".  Unfortunately, ""The Bat"" is the silent version from the twenties, not the Vincent Price version.  If you search 'Vincent Price', there is another compliation of the same movies for the same price.  Accoring to the reviews of that compilation, each of the movies has Vincent Price as the star!",1199318400,46,389,4.953846153846154
8193758,3,B000PY3XIW,"Help me out if I'm mistaken. I purchased this CD for my wife becuase she's a huge VP fan. The movie ""The Bat"" is not the 1959 one with VP. It's a silent film that must be the original from the 1920's. I'm amazed the makers didn't catch this. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this. I'm not happy and would like Amazon to send me the correct ""The Bat"". I gave it 3 stars becuase you just can beat the cheese of VP!",1199318400,24,413,3.8705882352941177
8193759,5,B000PY3XIW,I have to agree with the 1st reviewer. If you like Vincent Price this is a great DVD and a steal at $4.95. Highly recommended.,1193702400,2,126,4.08
