4188771,5,B003SPDSAS,"Have you ever found history one of those subjects that you just never really caught on to? Are you a long time lover of history with a huge wealth of knowledge about other countries and their struggles and triumphs? Do you have a sense of humor? THIS IS FOR YOU.

I myself was never one to listen very well in history classes. My thoughts were what's in the past is in the past. Why bother learning every single detail if I'll never use the information in my lifetime? My grades were decent and I only bothered to learn the most essential parts of history. How could it possibly become something I could pay attention to? I tried to find a way. I definitely found it.

Hetalia is a five minute long episode series. In each season there are 26 episodes, and yes, there are 26 in this dvd set. the running time is just about 2 1/2 hours. It started as a web series in japan. It follows the lives of the major countries of the world and what they've been through in the past, as well as touching upon the little quirks of the people and places in each one. In Hetalia, the characters are each of the countries in a human form. Battles and struggles take place with the appropriate countries literally slapping or yelling at each other in hilarious ways, and along with the quirky adult humor the show succeeds in not only capturing your attention in a way a normal high school classroom never could, but also keeps it and easily puts more info in your head that you never knew you would from an anime!

The show stays out of the touchiest subjects in the japanese casted version. They don't mention events such as the holocaust and the gruesome aspects of war. The English cast is brilliant and has pretty much a version all their own. I love the original voices, but in this show, I think the english cast gived the original quite a run for their money! They stay true to the original, and made some script changes to appeal to an american audience. They include some of our own stereotypes of the countries instead of the japanese stereotypes. I'm completely content with the changes and think of it as getting two shows in one! The amount of effort put into this series is outstanding.

NO. This show is NOT FOR KIDS. There are swears and it's filled with older humor. The show isn't censored. If you are easily offended by stereotypes and certain parts of history, do not watch this. If you aren't easily offended, this anime is a must have in your collection! the more you watch it, the more jokes you get. It will have you laughing for hours and you will want to look up every fact you come across in this well researched series.",1284768000,10,2632,4.409465020576132
4188772,5,B003SPDSAS,"An Obligatory Disclaimer:
I'll begin with an overly lengthy disclaimer: this show was NOT intended for those that are easily offended or upset by stereotyping, historical inaccuracies, or the trivialization of major historic events (also, homophobics beware: this show is laden with innuendo).  Now, let me just say, to all the people that fall into these aforementioned categories but purchased the show anyway and now are complaining vehemently about it via review, this show is exactly what it makes itself out to be: a CARTOON.  If you were looking for something serious, then good god what were you doing browsing through animated TV shows?  Would you go to Spongebob for life lessons?  No.  Likewise, if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of historic events, go buy a historical reenactment.  It's not rocket science.

That said, I'm going to attempt to answer some basic questions you might have as someone that is considering purchasing Hetalia: Axis Powers.

1.) I watched the Japanese version with English subs.  What's new?
Aside from the fact that you can now listen to the English dub, the dialogue seems to have been edited rather severely while still maintaining the basic personalities of the characters.  The English voice actors have also attempted to take on the accents of their respective countries, some more successfully than others.  Happily, this version contains both language tracks, so if you get fed up with the English dub you can always switch back to the Japanese track.

2.) I'm new to Hetalia.  It sounds interesting, but how do I know if it's for me?
Short answer?  Google it.  Just type in something along the lines of, ""hetalia english dub episode 1.""  Watch the first episode, posted by Funimation, and you should get the gist of the show fairly quickly.  Google the English sub version for an interesting comparison.

3.) What age group is Hetalia targeting?
Time for an annoyingly vague answer.  While this show is not particularly serious, it is also not intended for 5 year olds.  Sexual innuendo is very definitely present, and my best guess for a show rating would be something like PG13, though I can't say for certain.  (Though, in actuality, if you were to show this series to a 5 year old the innuendo would probably go right over his/her head.  It's not always particularly overt.)

4.) Do I have to be a history buff to enjoy/understand this?
Definitely not.  Though I personally love history, this show is largely character driven with only a very light dusting of plot (ie. historic events).

5.) I'm studying WW1/WW2 in history, will this help me?
While it may help you to differentiate between the different countries, it probably won't give you an accurate understanding of what transpired during the World Wars.  That said, if you find history dull, this will almost certainly make it more interesting for you, and thus help you memorize various historical events and the motivations behind them.

My View:
This is a wonderful show, that in my mind promotes cultural understanding by not pointing the finger of blame at any one country for any of the bloody events of the past, instead choosing to simply make each country lovable in its own quirky way.  In my opinion, we need more shows like Hetalia that force us to step back and not take ourselves so seriously for five minutes.  In summary, this is easily one of my favorite shows and is in fact one of the only animes I'll watch.  It's definitely worth checking out.  Five stars.",1282694400,108,3497,4.876271186440678
4188773,5,B003SPDSAS,"Oaky, I've watched the dub on Comcast OnDemand now (even though I bought the DVD... whatever.) :) It rocks! I really don't have much to say that isn't repeating what the other 5 Star reviewers said. :D They changed the script a bit for the dub, but it's still awesome (but not as awesome as Prussia! XD)",1282348800,6,303,4.333333333333333
4188774,5,B003SPDSAS,"I've never read the manga, but my sister got me hooked on the anime with the words ""chibi Italy"". (chibis are tiny cute versions of a charater with biiiggg eyes)

The premise of the show is simple: countries are personified as bishonen (cute boys), and historical events are played out on a personal level (such as the allying of Italy and Germany, or the interaction of Italy and The Holy Roman Empire). The episodes are about 5 minutes in length.

I don't know too much about World War II, so I didn't have any problems with historical inaccuracy, on the contrary, I probably learned some things (I feel dumb, but I had never heard of the term ""Axis Powers"" before watching this show).

It is easy to be offended by this show, as the characters (countries) are stereotypical- i.e. Italy is a cute, but totally dumb bishonen, who occasionally dresses up in a maid outfit and looks just like a girl. So, for example if you are Italian, you might object to your county's portrayal and/or handling of historic events. Or you might object to the turning of very serious war matters into jokes. So far, as an American, I haven't been too offended.

I watched this show in Japanese (voice acting was very good, especially Italy) and have yet to view the English cast, but I have heard the English voice actors did an excellent job and that the script was very well adapted, with the jokes adjusted to fit the language.

I stopped watching Hetalia online when I heard it was licensed, so I am really excited for this set to be release on DVD so that I can finally finish watching it!",1281657600,6,1577,4.519298245614035
4188775,5,B003SPDSAS,"This anime is fantasic. The dialogue was changed a little bit from the original, however, I think it fits better for the english audience. The english voice actors did an amazing job with the accents. This is definietly one of my favorite animes and I dare you not to get hooked after the first 5 episodes.",1280275200,26,306,4.482142857142857
4188776,5,B003SPDSAS,"I've been following the manga and anime since the series debuted in Japan. My biggest fear for the dubbing of ""Hetalia"" was that it would be stripped of everything not PC (which is literally the entire show). However, in the English version, the jokes are more offensive and the innuendo more rampant. The Japanese version skirted around any Nazi references, but the English version throws one in no more than a 2 minutes into the first episode. Couple that with America referring to Russia as ""cannon fodder"" and you've got yourself a winner of a show. If you're easily offended then this is obviously not the series for you, though I appreciate the culture clash and parodying of stereotypes. Of course, I also laugh at dead baby jokes.

Fans of the series might complain about the dialogue changes, which, from what I've seen, capture the spirit of the situation but contain altered jokes. Some of the voices are taking me a while to get used to, but overall I think the dubbing was well done. If I hadn't watched the Japanese version, I probably wouldn't think twice about judging the English voices. It's simply hard not to compare when you're used to something else.

I am impressed by the script changes and actually like the English dialogue more than the original. I'm basing my opinion on the few short clips FUNimation has put on YouTube, but I have high hopes for the rest of the series.",1279756800,117,1399,4.682926829268292

Instead of watching it on English dubbed anime websites, I decided to order the first season (I'm going to order the second one too) DVD. I am very happy!

You've got to give it 5 episodes before you throw in the towel, by then you are either really lost and upset or really lost but laughing so hard you don't care.

The dubbers (or Funimation, as they like to be called) did a really terrific job, they equally insult every culture and country they can without really crossing a line.  If you are easily offended, don't watch.  You'll just ruin it for the rest of us.  Go watch My little Pony or something. Mkay?",1366070400,,584,4.471698113207547

4188788,5,B003SPDSAS,"Ah Hetalia making me realize that an anime doesn't need to have a plot to enjoy it (I mean there is a plot but it's pretty much scattered around).

So I'll say it like this, season 1 focuses on the Axis Power trio (Italy, Germany and Japan) and their (failed) attempts to defeat the Allied Nations while jumping around to other timelines explaining how some nations came to be.

The beginning starts in the modern day (and basically the most current thing in the timeline unless you count the Hetalia Bloodbaths) and then jumps back between WWI, WWII, the American Revolution and Roman Empire meaning you'll get a few serious episodes that hit home and then the rest are funny (which is how Hetalia rolls).

It won't take you long to finish season 1, but once you memorize the characters of season 1, it will be easier to identify them when you go to season 2, 3, 4 (and 5).",1361750400,,874,4.45

While I was in high school history had zero meaning to me whatsoever and I dumped it out of my noodle just as quick as I lodged it in (temporarily for tests). But this anime has taught me SO many things, many lessons that I recall... and some things I learned without noticing.

4188815,4,B003SPDSAS,"I discovered Hetalia: Axis Powers from youtube on Funimation channel. I saw the subbed version first and for the whole day I saw all of the episodes. It was funny, creative, and I actually learned stuff. The humor is rather crude at times and plays on stereotypes from many different nations. When I heard the Hetalia: Axis Powers were going on DVDs in the US, I had to buy it. Well, it actually took a while to buy it, but by the time I decided to buy it from amazon I got the second season as well. I was slightly disappointed the DVDs would only play the English dubbed version and not giving a chance for the original Japanese version. However I did like the English voice cast and it gave the nations/characters a refreshing new look. The humor in the English dubbed however is slightly more crude than the Japanese version, but it's pretty good still. You can read the English subtitles as well which is based off the Japanese cast script than the English dubbed. The extras for the DVD is okay. You can listen to the interviews of the creators and the director and the voice cast. The episodes themselves are short and when I mean short I mean only about 5-8 minutes. Overall, for the price you are getting for the DVD season 1, it is a must buy. I still play the season 1 and 2 over and over again.",1336435200,,1306,4.33469387755102
4188816,5,B003SPDSAS,"I bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she gives it 2 thumbs up and a 5 star rating. She says that her history grades have gone up significantly because of the way it teaches world history and that it is accurate and can be verified anywhere.

4188817,1,B003SPDSAS,I heard this series was  extremely popular. When I put this in my dvd player I was appalled the voice acting was terrible. And the storyline was bland and repetitive. I have collected and own over 50 anime titles and this was by far the worst anime I've ever seen. For gods sake pokemon offers more than this bilge.,1331942400,,315,4.338983050847458

I had never seen it and it was very reasonable on price so I decided ""Oh what the heck"" and ordered it. I have never regreted my decision once. This anime is hysterical! All the characters are just spot on. The accents are brillant! The dub I think is just unreal because these voice actors nailed every word that they spoke.

4188842,5,B003SPDSAS,"Similar to DiGi Charat & Nekojiru Gekijou in the just-under-6-minutes-an-episode zany comedy formula.

This series is Not Rated, but it was apparently rated MA on Youtube because Funimation added swearing to the dub & the whole point of the show is playing on national stereotypes, so Funimation thought it might have a negative impact on impressionable children. All of the characters are completely lovable & we adore their quirks. Potential offences garnering Youtube's MA rating include that there are only 2 races of people represented; Caucasians (which are 98% blondes) & Asian, that French are pansexual perverts, that Russians are unstable & scary, & that Italians are weak & useless, but even Japan is not exempt; he comes off as shy, submissive, & naive.

Another thing that should be noted is that this series WAS intended for adult men (being labeled as Seinen), but by mid series, the constant homoerotic overtones have scared all but the most unsquikable male viewers (just like with Gensoumaden Saiyuki & Black Butler). Most of the fans of this series are Fujoshi; women aged 18-54 who are very perverted & squee at the very things that scare the male viewers away.",1321142400,,1181,5.020408163265306
4188843,5,B003SPDSAS,"Really funny anime. Very stereotypical of countries and their people but all in good fun. Love the characters and anime style. Wish most the writing in the show was translated from Japanese though, instead of the subtitles.",1318982400,,223,5.054054054054054
4188844,5,B003SPDSAS,"The CD case has a cover which is great and appealing to the eye. The CD's have cute printings of some characters. I know some people don't like the dubbed version of Hetalia so in this CD, Funimation has kindly put the subbed version as well. There are two CD's, one of them is the actual animation with a few episodes the voice actors comment on. The other CD is mostly just extras but it has a very cute picture of Chibitalia and Holy Roman Empire with a little cat on it.
The only thing I think they could have improved on is the subbing. I think they could have made it look neater and more professional by using a white color with black outlining rather than yellow. Although the accents were a very cute idea that I support fully, sometimes it's hard to hear what they actually say, so they could have also subbed the dubbed version if that makes any sense.",1313193600,,863,4.300613496932515
4188845,5,B003SPDSAS,"At first, I decided I definitely did not like Hetalia. Why? Because I figured that all it was was a bunch of fangirls drooling over their yaoi. Which just happened to be countries. Then, when some of my friends started getting into it, I figured watching it couldn't hurt, so I did. Let me tell you: This is more than it seems. I thought that it was going to be just a bunch of innuendo and fanservice, but I found that it was actually very funny and even more than a little cute.

While some people say that ""How this show portrays history is inaccurate,"" it actually follows most of the textbooks pretty well. They add stereotypes, and it's not meant to be taken completely seriously, but otherwise, it's not as bad as people think.

The fanservice is respectfully lowered to a minimum. While the Germany x Italy and HRE x ChibItalia is pretty canon, it's not overly glossed, and they have more cute buddy-buddy moments than they do romantic ones. Other girls might not see that in the same way I do, of course, but when Germany says ""I love you"" and kisses Italy on his cheeks, to me, that's more of a sign of affectionate brotherly love than actual romance.

Personally, I like the anime for it's character, originality, and humor. It's definitely more of a comedy than it is anything else. I recommend it to anyone who's interested in something funny. ^_^",1312329600,5,1360,4.542857142857143
4188846,5,B003SPDSAS,"I will say now, I did not expect to love Hetalia. My friend introduced it to me. Typically, I don't like things that are incredibly popular (and if anyone's been to an anime convention, the sheer number of Hetalia cosplayers proves this show's popularity). However, I could NOT STOP LAUGHING all throughout the first season!!! I usually prefer the subbed versions of anime, but I highly recommend watching the dubbed in this case. The jokes are great!!! The accents are hysterical!! The one liners just keep coming!! Warning, there is content some would find offensive, especially if you are incredibly political (America gets quite the reputation), but if you take this with a grain of salt, you will truly ejoy it!",1310947200,,716,4.925619834710743
4188847,5,B003SPDSAS,"The dub of Hetalia in my opinion was slightly more entertaining. The different accents helped me identify the characters and the Russian voice actor was quite funny.

Before Hetalia I was pretty interested in history, yet some things won't stick. My sister, who is 12 watched a couple of episodes with me and was quite amused herself. It helped her remember who was on the Axis and Allies Powers in WWII. While this anime is no replacement for a history book, it does help create a some remembrance for class.

However, some foul language is thrown around, such as the F-word every now and then. Like another reviewer said, this is about equivalent to a PG-13 movie in some senses.

All in all the anime was very entertaining, and at the end of the day, merely a cartoon. Some may be offended by the stereotypes or the crack America made saying Russia was ""canon fodder"".

If you still have any doubts, just look it up on FUNimation's youtube channel. I personally love Hetalia whole hearted-ly, and really, the dub compared to others -cough cough vampire knight cough cough- was exceptionable, and that's saying something coming from a person like me, who prefers subs greatly over dubs. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.",1310860800,2,1227,4.746478873239437
4188848,3,B003SPDSAS,"Hetalia Axis Powers is well-drawn, fun, funny, and mildly educational, but there's just not enough actual substance to the plot or characters to make it a truly moving or memorable series. It honestly doesn't offer a lot of rewatch value.

Some people may find its' national stereotypes and its' lighthearted nature about a dark subject offense. To those of you curious about the series, I say that you have to be willing to laugh at EVERYONE including yourself before you watch. This series can be crude at times but realize that it is making fun of the world and the way we think of and envision ourselves to be. For that, Hetalia makes a good point. Everybody on the show has good and bad qualities.

Given its' episode length of barely five or six minutes, the price for one season alone at the current time seems a little high. I'm not sure exactly the quality of the extras attached to the DVD set, but I think it would be a much more reasonable price if seasons one and two were boxed together.

Fun, but definitely a rental first, and then purchase for truly hardcore fans of the series.",1307664000,3,1095,4.52020202020202

From what I've watched in this first season, Hetalia doesn't get off into the serious bad parts of WWII but more about the people in the military force who went to war, made alliences with other nations and everything else possibly resorting to the side events to WWII.  Some people find the anime a little offensive but I'm half British and my friend is half German and we thought it was just crazingly hilarious.  If you don't mind too many stereotypes but still laugh at them and or yourself, then this is perfect!",1307491200,,665,4.563025210084033
4188870,5,B003SPDSAS,"Unless you are so uptight that stereotypes like ""Italians like pasta"" and ""Greeks take too long in the market"" tee you off, you will find this show funny as hell.  Especially if you know anything about history (and yes, they do put in little blurbs for some of the more obscure references).  I hadn't found a good anime to fall in love with in a long time until I saw Hetalia - it is my new favorite.  Ignore the Amazon review (I can't believe they let that be the review... ""hey, let's have someone review this that has their panties in a twist and hates it!  Yeah!  That'll sell copies!"" ...?!) unless you are equally bothered by HUMOROUS CARTOONS.  It's really fast-paced; the episodes are only ten minutes or so apiece, so it's a bit like loading up an ADD history teacher who is a stand-up comedian on the side with sugar and caffeine and having him teach class.  There is a lot of jumping around between storylines, and you'll definitely get the theme song stuck in your head hearing it every ten minutes, but it's so worth it. :)

It is mostly 20th century history, though there are flashbacks to earlier time periods.  The younger a country is, the younger the anthropomorphic character is.  Grandpa Rome, who disappeared a long time ago, makes periodic cameos as well.

I started watching this show when I was taking a 20th century European history class... and ended up sharing it with my class.  If you like history at all (and even if you don't), it's one of those cracked-up random animes that will have you laughing at the ""WTF-ness"" of it all.  I love it.

BTW, I've only watched it in subtitled mode... I did, out of curiosity, turn on dubs for about five minutes and wanted to shoot it.  Italy sounds like Mario... as in Super Mario Brothers Mario... and the other attempts at accents were no less annoying.  BAD fake-accent dub.  Go for subtitles.",1307232000,,1865,4.5359281437125745

4188875,2,B003SPDSAS,"EDIT: BTW, the following refers to the subtitled version, not the dubbed one (haven't seen that).

First of all, this series (of which I've only seen the first season) is nothing if not politically incorrect. It is a broad collage of stereotypes, insanity, inanity and more stereotypes; and all of this is in keeping with the point of the show, which is a humorous look at WWII. Can you laugh about that war? Perhaps the more important question is, should we? I think, as with most things, it's a question of how things are presented, and how the more difficult topics are handled.

In Hetalia, countries are represented by characters, and every character is a mass of stereotypical flaws -- with Japan, primarily, and Germany, to a lesser extent, being the notable exceptions. The character of Japan is a brilliant, hard-working, very polite young man, though shy and not as well acquainted with the rest of the world as he perhaps should be. Germany is a hardcore stickler for the rules, who shows little emotion; like Japan, however, he is smart, hard working, and prone to get results. The other nations/characters, however, do not fare so well. Italy is a charming, rascally but inept and useless coward who surrenders at the first sign of danger; he is obsessed with pasta, and produces white flags as his contribution to the war effort. America is a bit of buffoon, who is fond of declaring that he is ""the Hero"", talking with his mouth full, and eating unlimited hamburgers -- while proposing absurd solutions to world problems (like, creating a super hero to defeat global warming). France is a self-important, militarily inept, excuse-making fellow, with a passionate dislike of England, and a history (which he pooh-pooh's) of failures and stealing other people's thunder. England, meanwhile, despises his former ward, America, as well as his rival, France; England's cooking is notoriously bad, and ridiculed throughout the show. Russia is a sadistic young man who is frequently plotting evil against his fellow nations. China is a power-hungry nation that produces great food; etc.

If it wasn't obvious by now, the show is extremely sympathetic to the Axis powers, save Italy, whom is ridiculed to the point of monotony for cowardice. During one point, the show practically lays the blame for WWII on France and post-WWI pecuniary arrangements imposed on Germany.

The structure of the show is a little disjointed at times; this is not helped by the 5-minute episodes, or the way it haphazardly switches from ""present"" to ""chibi"" (""childhood"" era) forms.

Is it funny? Yes, at times. In fact, at times, it is hilarious. Things like the Holocaust, war crimes, racism, etc., weren't discussed; and so, in a parody world where those things don't happen, it seems ok to laugh. The depictions of various ""nations"" are extremely stereotyped and, with the exception of Japan, mostly insulting; however, bizarre as it sounds, this originally came off as light-hearted. As an Italian American, I could laugh at the depictions of both Italians and Americans...in the beginning. After awhile, the continual harping on Italy and his cowardice seemed more spiteful than amusing. So, too, did the general lack of positive features of any non-Axis, non-Italy characters -- which, coupled with the generally positive portrayal of Japan and Germany, seemed as if the creator of the series had a point to prove. Comedy, even irreverent-but-tasteful comedy such as this could have been, I can appreciate; but a ""funny"" defense of the Axis is just wrong. I could have laughed along if every ""character"" was portrayed as equally laughable; it would have been all in good fun then. But when 2/3 of the Axis powers are portrayed as almost noble and admirable, as opposed to a world full of selfish, greedy buffoons...well, it's not funny anymore.

This could have been hilarious. But, it wasn't.",1296259200,14,3886,5.017054263565892

4188878,5,B003SPDSAS,"World history tends to be kind of... dry. If you don't have much imagination, it just ends up being a big mass of dates and battles.

Too bad they don't show ""Hetalia: Axis Powers - The Complete First Season"" in schools, because it actually manages to present world history (particularly that of the World Wars) in a manner that is fun, quirky and downright bizarre (""I agree wis America."" ""ENOUGH or I'll beat you with my peace prize!""). And yes, most of the countries are represented by pretty young men.

Germany is searching through the woods for the descendent of the great Roman Empire... only to stumble across a naive, blubbering Italy hiding inside a tomato crate. He captures Italy, but is chagrined when Italy attaches himself like a limpet because ""I get fed and nobody picks on me."" They join forces with the very formal Japan, and the Axis Powers are born.

However, another alliance has appeared: the Allied Forces, made up of America, China, Russa, England and France. And as World Wars I/II rage, both sides must grapple with a cursed chair, England's bad cooking, supermarket lines, marriage proposals, being stranded on a deserted island, wok attacks, and cuckoo clocks... when they're not fighting one another.

Oh, and we get fun flashbacks to ""Chibitalia's"" childhood, when he was stalked by the Holy Roman Empire (uuuhh... baby Germany in a hat?), dragged into Austria's household, and ate churros.

""Hetalia Axis Powers - The Complete First Season"" is one of those animes you shouldn't watch if you're easily offended. EVERYBODY in this show is a national stereotype who acts in a stereotypical way (ex: America is a bit arrogant and endearingly over-the-top, Japan is overly formal and can't pronounce Ls and Rs, Italy is obsessed with pasta, etc).

And it's all in good fun -- the stuff that goes on is based on real historical events, but filtered through a satirical anime/reality-show lens. The dialogue is gutsplittingly funny, peaking with Italy's song about Germany (""Even though I'm your prisoner, you give me food/and it doesn't suck like English food!""), and there's goofy slapstick and cultural references aplenty.

But there are also some more somber moments, such as America reminiscing about the War for Independence and his painful rift with England, or China thinking of how he found and raised Japan. And while all the characters are national stereotypes, the writers succeed in making each one endearing and likable... well, except maybe Russia. He's just creepy.

""Hetalia: Axis Powers - The Complete First Season"" is very short (each episode is about five minutes long), but world history here has never been so cracktastic.",1292716800,4,2669,5.02262443438914

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Axis Powers Hetalia Season 1 was a great dub of the original.  In our opinion, it was even better than the original.  The script was changed a bit to appeal more to American humor, and we found it to be amazing.  The accents aren't all 'horrible', but they're just bad enough to be funny.  Many people who watch this complain about the changes and call the dub 'racist and crude'... and to an extent, it is.  However, it's not centered to one country in particular, and it doesn't bash anyone... And humor is different in different countries.  We have watched this disc over 5 times now, and every time was with a different group of friends.  We loved it, they loved it, and we can't wait to get Season 2.

I'd suggest this to anyone who likes Hetalia, and definitely to those just getting into the series.  I know it was one of the best animes I ever bought. ;]",1286755200,,1113,4.397058823529412
4188923,4,B003SPDSAS,"This is my review after going through half the DVD

-PROS ----
First off, this is an amazing dub! Most of the voices are very good, and the accents add a nice, unique touch. I especially like the voices of Austria, Japan, Germany, Spain, both Italys, and Chibi-Italy. The dialogue has changed to make things more offensive/funnier, which I love. I can confidently say I prefer the English dub's jokes to the original. For those who do not like that, they still include the Japanese voices along with the unedited English subs.

The dialogue has changed drastically in the English dub, partially because there are some not-so-obvious cultural reference jokes that Americans won't get. For instance, Italy hugs Japan, and in the English version, it's because it's an invasion of personal space. But in the Japanese version, Japan tells Italy it's his ""first time"" and that he hopes Italy takes responsibility for it. I'm not Japanese, so I didn't catch the joke here. There isn't enough time to add a cultural footnote for people to read either. After some googling, I found out that if you hug/kiss a Japanese person back then, that means you're proposing marriage.

Funimation tries really hard to make Hetalia funnier and more culture-friendly for Americans, and I think they succeeded without butchering the anime. They made some parts more offensive and added on to the gay jokes.

The extra disc includes more explanations on the history behind Hetalia. This is invaluable to me, since I couldn't stand history (before I discovered this, anyway).

- CONS ----
However, sometimes the accents make the characters hard to understand, and this DVD does NOT include the English subtitles for the English track. It only has the English subtitles for the Japanese track. So if you try to watch the English dub with the subtitles, you'll realize the subtitles do not match up with what the characters are saying (since they were meant for the Japanese dub, not the English one). Sometimes I can't catch what Italy is saying because he speaks so fast and with an accent (like when he was in the tomato box)--don't get me wrong, he sounds great, but sometimes he speaks too fast. In the Japanese subtitled version, I have to pause when he starts begging for his life, because he speaks too fast and the subtitles go by too fast. But I can't do that in the English version because they didn't include separate subtitles for the English dub.

Fortunately, I can still understand everybody about 85% of the time, so it's not too bad. But for those of you who have a hard time understanding people with accents, the English dub might not be for you -- in that case, you may want to stick with the Japanese subs.

As mentioned above, most of the voices are good. I don't really like China's voice b/c it doesn't sound like a Chinese accent or even a fake Chinese accent. It sounds more like somebody doing a random accent. This could just be me though, since I'm Chinese and have been hearing the fobby accent for quite a while. I mean, why couldn't China have sounded as cool as Japan? China's voice does get better in the later episodes though.

England doesn't have a British accent, but he does sound like Stewey from Family Guy, so it's cool.

----OVERALL
Overall, I think it's a great dub. The English dub is so much funnier and includes more historical references.",1286582400,8,3360,4.739726027397261
4188924,4,B003SPDSAS,"Combine the wacky history of the old the old Warner Bros cartoon ""Histeria!"" with the Japanese ""Moe"" aesthetic, and there you have ""Hetalia.""  Creator Hidekazu Himaruya got the idea for the comic when he was studying abroad in New York, and stumbled on a web page full of ethnic jokes. He thought that might make a good basis for a comic, but instead of being spiteful with the ethnic stereotypes Hidekazu went ""moe."" Each country gets their own little costume and country personification, with some adventures and little bits of random history thrown in.

""Hetalia"" (meaning ""Useless Italy,"" being a portmanteau between the word for ""useless"" (""hetare"") and ""Italy"" (""Italia."")) originated as a webcomic, before being bound as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/manga/dp/1427818762/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">manga</a>, and now finally makes the leap to animation.  True to its webcomic origins, ""Hetalia"" doesn't have an ongoing plot but is more of a series of gags each about five minutes long and that constitutes and episode.  This means you get twenty-six episodes on this DVD set, but don't be fooled into thinking that is some kind of bargin.  Most of the gags here are taken directly from the comic, so if you have read them manga then be prepared to see the same jokes and skits animated.

I gave the manga a rating of ""Good, but not Great"" and that is pretty much how I feel about the anime as well.  What works in the manga works here.  What doesn't work in the manga still doesn't work here.  This is funny, light humor with an ethnic/historical twist, and is good to watch for fun but doesn't have much going for it beyond that.

One of the things that annoyed me about this DVD set is that even though each episode is roughly five minutes long, you still get the whole intro and outro theme songs.  Keep the remote at hand because unless you are truly dedicated you will probably be skipping the theme songs ever five minutes.

Another thing that you will need your remote for is the pause button.  Just like the manga, ""Hetalia"" the anime throws up little explanatory factoids every now and then to explain the historical humor, but these blip on and off pretty fast.  Its like Pop-up Video but without the screen time.  This was much more effective in the manga when your eyes weren't racing to keep up with the pace of the anime.

I think the less you know about history the more you will love ""Hetalia.""  If you already know most of the ins and outs of WWII, then just shut off your brain and enjoy the show, otherwise the errors will drive you mad.  If you don't even know what ""Axis Powers"" means and the words ""Tripartite Pact"" leave you scratching your head, then this might inspire you to looks some things up and learn more about one of the most important events in human history.  You know...in a cute, chibi style.",1286496000,2,2883,4.799595141700405

It's actually quite insensitive, filled with more offensive language than the Japanese counterpart, and the translation is just God aweful. There are some people out there who really like that sort of thing but if that's not for you then there is an alternative... also if you're a first timer to the series then please watch the Japanese track with English subtitles as the Japanese are more sensitive in language and stereotyping than their Anglophone counterparts. And as for the whole innuendo thing... it's more of a ""if you take things a certain way then that's the way you take them"" type of situation. Like shipping (for those of you who get what that means). If you just take it all in good stride and see it more as comedy than an affront to your own personal lifestyle and whatnot then its all good :D By the way my 5/5 stars isn't for the English dub (that would get 2.5/5 in my book)... it's for the Japanese track version.",1286496000,,1019,4.513513513513513

The dub script just barely follows the original and often ignores interesting historical bits. For instance, Germany is not fretting over not feeding ""Heir Stick"" but worrying about having been able to invade Italy with nothing more than a stick. So when the text explaining Germany's invasion of Italy pops up, it seems completely out of context.
The other unfortunate difference is that Funimation tried to give each character the appropriate accent for it's country. While this worked in one or two instances, most of the accents are so incredibly bad that it's almost painful.

Overall, the series is well worth watching as long as you're willing to watch the subtitled version. The set also includes a bonus DVD with historical tidbits that match up with the story of each episode. It also includes commentary for a few of the episodes.",1285718400,7,1106,4.946236559139785

Hetalia at the heart of it is a lighthearted spoof on history and should not be taken seriously at all. The DVD has wonderful bonuses on it and I enjoyed the dub but as far as amazon's packaging is concerned it was poorly done. My DVD arrived with the protective box dented and then the actual dvd case had several tears in the plastic case. Not to mention the giant tear where the dvd case opens and is now in danger of completley breaking in half. I've never used scotch tape on a dvd before and I shouldn't have to. The outside case could easily be blamed on the postal service but not the inside case. This sort of thing bothers me quite a bit and I almost feel paying full price is worth having a pristine DVD box not to mention not recieving my DVD until eight days after its release.

If you've had a bad day recently get some Hetalia, it will cheer you up or at least make you go wtf so much you forget about your problems.",1408665600,,287,4.142857142857143

8404546,5,B003SPDSAS,"Hilarious and enjoyable! This is a wonderful anime for any anime lover, however I cannot stretch this enough-- while both dubs are fantastic, if anything might be found especially insulting then it will be the English Dubbed.  If you want much more harmless jokes and still somewhat educational moments then WATCH THE JAPANESE DUB with English Subs. Sometimes the English Dub tends to screw around more anyway. It's funny but.... Sometimes Funimation should just tone down.

The Japanese Dub feels more like an actual anime while the English tends to sound like an absolute and only an extreme parody of everything that does not always make coherent sense for the sake of the audience.

The English Dub does try to go as far as they can without being completely inconsiderate, and it is still purely for comedy intentions (like Ted or some of those other movies). Do not think it is meant to down talk your country or race. You cannot take this show personally at all! It isn't meant to be and every country is made fun of. Even Himaruya, who is Japanese and created the original comic series, added stereotypes of his own country, which is ways may be seen as ""silly or misunderstood behaviors.""

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST: For any interested in watching this show PLEASE, do not interpret the show solely by what the fandom or fan art depict and say. No, Germany is not a black suit Nazi or seen as Jew murdering Nazi at all. Never in the comics is he ever shown that. Himaruya did not go there, and neither did the show for obvious reasons. You even forget that Germany is Germany sometimes despite the time period that is often used as context in the episodes. This is the same with the rest of the characters. There are a lot of moments where it is a parody of events in history(excluding the Holocaust), but there are also several moments where the characters are just themselves without the country part. Not everything they do and say is based off of a stereotype and not everything they say references to a historical date, event or happening.

That is all. Otherwise, please take the time with an open mind to take in what this world comedy has to provide and teach, both English and Japanese wise (but more Japanese on the history lessons.)",1399075200,,2248,4.62406015037594
