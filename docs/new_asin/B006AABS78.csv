8495748,5,B006AABS78,"In the early 20s, the government/police cracked down on labor unions, communists, and immigrants. On circumstantial evidence, Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested for robbery and murders at a shoe factory. The trial was a political sham intended to serve as an example to immigrants and anarchists. This film is a very literate representation of the Sacco and Vanzetti trial and the events prior to and subsequent to the trial. Newsreel footage is interspersed with the dramatic presentation. Issues of police brutality, racism, injustice, and prejudice are well presented. If you have an interest in this case and the circumstances surrounding the issues at the time, this is must see viewing. An exceptional film!",1495238400,,711,5.300884955752212
