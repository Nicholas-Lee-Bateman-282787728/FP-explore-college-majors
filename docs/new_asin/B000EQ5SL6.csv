2529611,5,B000EQ5SL6,"This DVD set contains The Hulkster's most famous and most of his greatest matches.  Hogan is greatest wrestling star of all time.  Not Austin, Not Flair, Not Hart, no one can or could touch the Immortal Hulk Hogan.",1143676800,3,214,4.605263157894737
2529612,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Now to the scum who wrote the first few reviews, Hogan is God and is the Greatest all time wrestler, now, you say he has no ability, ITS FAKE JESUS, its all about can you talk the talk and walk the walk etc, look at stone cold no wrestling skills steve austin he has no skills what so ever but made it because of his ego and great character and don't get me started on the RCock lol.

Now i admit he has a ego its also called a character, and he got this far because of it, and ill be onest he deserves it because, he aint got there just because of it, it took him years of hardship and struggle to get where he is, broken bones 7 days a week travling few hours sleep, he did all this so todays wrestlers have it brecause of him. so he chills for 15 years and lives of his past glory posing and doing run ins so what at least he is still there, where is the Rock now, abandond his fans, where is stone cold, where is brock and goldberg, where is rick flair o year he is attached to HHH and McMahons Ass. Hogan deserves it, who in the wrestling business has put himself out there for the fans, we want him, thats why he is still there, and will always be there.

So Before you slag him off read his book and decide for your self, he had it hard and deserves all he gets, he cares about the sport unlick your heros of today who are getting there foot in the door for something bigger, now call him name.",1143504000,2,1401,3.9469964664310955
2529613,1,B000EQ5SL6,"CRAPPERMANIA, the WWE is bringing out a four disc DVD on Hulk Hogan. I had a go at Dusty Rhodes for having a three disc DVD, but bringing out a four disc DVD on a guy who has no wrestling ability what so ever and spends more time posing then actually wrestling is just absurd.

I do have to give Hulk Hogan some credit. Who would of thought one guy could single handily destroy WCW and not have one half decent match in the process. I do not own this DVD, but I do know how every single match on this DVD will end. BIG BOOT followed by the LEG DROP. The guy is as routine as Ric Flair.

The WWE have managed to put together this four disc DVD with pretty much every single match Hogan has had in his worthless career, but they have left out his greatest match. His match against Brock Lesner on an episode of Smackdown back in 2002. Brock Lesner beat the holy hell out of the geriatric bald headed fool. If you want to see this match in all its glory, then purchase the Summerslam 2002 DVD.

Look here, BROTHER, save yourself some money, BROTHER and don't buy this DVD BROTHER. O' BROTHER.",1143158400,,1089,4.1761904761904765
2529614,5,B000EQ5SL6,"I am glad they are deciding to finally re-release this set. I wrote petitions in the past, and even wrote to the WWE in an effort to get ""Hulk still rules"" re-released. I was never able to get ahold of the DVD set, just the watered down VHS. So I for one am very glad the WWE is finally listening to what I said, and probably what millions of others said as well.

Who is a more marketable commodity than Hulk Hogan? As far as wrestling goes, NOBODY. Sometimes I have to question the WWE executive's intelligence. Hulk Hogan made the WWE what it is today, they can't deny that. He carried it for years on his own shoulders, and still could today if he wanted to. Hulk still, and always will rule brothers!",1143072000,4,705,4.2611940298507465
2529615,2,B000EQ5SL6,"I will give credit where credit is due. Yes, Hulk Hogan helped make wrestling mainstream and is arguably the most popular wrestler of all time. As much as I hate to say it, he IS one of the all time greats.

What I can't overlook is how, even to this day, incredibly obnoxious Terry Bollea remains. Get this DVD set when it comes out to see how big his ego is. WHY is the Starrcade match with Sting here?! Hogan's ego pushing an unclean finish so Sting doesn't get a clean pin ruins what could have one of the greatest matches of all time. Then you have the Ric Flair matches. Flair pushed for Hogan to come over to WCW, and even agreed to lose the first few. Hogan repays him by slowly burying Flair's career in the late 90's. The SummerSlam match with HBK might be the best example of Hogan's ego. What made of all Shawn Michael's promos mocking Hogan great was that everything he said was true. I'm surprised they didn't put Hogan's ""win"" over Yokozuna at Wrestlemania IX on this set.

I won't say that Hogan is the only one in the wrestling industry with an ego. Of course he isn't. I admit that I'm a fan of Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair, but I also admit that they have egos too. The difference is that they make it a point to make others look better in their matches, something Hogan, to this day, refuses to do.",1142985600,4,1318,4.247011952191235
2529616,4,B000EQ5SL6,Alot of these matches can be found on his last dvd release.  I don't know why they are making yet ANOTHER Hulk Hogan dvd set.  I'm still prob. going to get this dvd just because of the WCW matches and that's it.  I hope they release a eight disc dvd on the Career of Ric Flair seeing he is much better.,1141430400,,302,3.918032786885246
2529617,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Project postponed indefinitely by WWE  Why are there no matches from SNME? And why all the WrestleMania matches? I only have the SNME matches featured on Hulk's 1st set, I have all those Mania matches on dvd already. Why not more WCW matches? I have at least 2 of the WCW matches as well. But I will be buying this for the matches I don't have, and have either never seen or have not seen in a really long time. But I only wish that one day the WWE puts out another flair, hbk, and hitman sets. And gives us Macho Man, Sting, and dvd on the greatest tag-teams ever. I can't wait until they put the rest of this years dvds such as...Dusty Rhodes, greatest managers, Best of the AWA, Flyin Brian, John Cena, and more.",1141084800,2,715,4.218978102189781
2529618,5,B000EQ5SL6,We have found the anti christ hulk says say your prayers but when in wcw he got paid twice as much as rick flair and he used his power to bring down and destroy the man who got him his job. How do you think hogan had such a long reign in wcw he used his powers to push down others and used his powers gave to him in his contract to refuse to lose. Did anyone see when he whipped ric flairs son in the ring and was suppost to whip him with the belt 5 times he did it more like 16 times. well hogan will always be hated by ric flair fans for what he did as far as his work in the ring he is entertaining but he doesn't sell well and a leg drop what kind of lame move is that. Well whenever this dvd comes out i'm still buying it because he is entertaining and even though he is rude and to some point evil he could bring forth the crowd and bring forth energy. well back to the dvd it is suppost to be released nere november so i wouldn't get it unless it drops down a few more dollars i would wait until the release date is posted incase it gets canceled and you don't get a dvd or anything like that.,1140998400,5,1100,3.7869565217391306
2529619,3,B000EQ5SL6,"Many of the matches here are repeats from other sets that have already been released(not a problem if this is the only WWE DVD that you own). In total there is like eight Wrestlemania matches included in this set(and most of the other matches are also from big PPV events) that I have seen many times over already. The two rare matches I haven't seen includes the one against Nick Bockwinkel in the AWA during 1983 and against Curt Hennig in the XWF in 2001. Also included is the 2005 induction of Hulk Hogan into the WWE Hall of Fame. And since this is an older release, all references to 'WWF' will either be bleeped or blurred out. Because of the recent incident with Hogan, we will probably never get a Blu-ray release either.",1442188800,,730,4.455223880597015

2529629,5,B000EQ5SL6,"I've followed Hulk Hogan since his early days. I moved a lot, from New Hampshire to Minnesota, to Florida, then Maine. In those years, I saw Hulk Hogan wrestling for the WWE (WWF) and AWA. I was thrilled to see Hogan in action, live, on several wrestling cards in the Minneapolis, St Paul area. I saw some of the early Wrestlemania events.

This is a great collection. Three DVDs, each in its own ""page."" Each page lists what's on each DVD. I paid $12 for this collection back in April 2013. As of November 11, 2013, you can get it for $9.63! What are you waiting for?!",1384128000,,569,4.317757009345795

2529636,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Arn Anderson said it best when he said ""If you don't know anything about wrestling, someone would say oh thats that thing that Hulk Hogan does."" While maybe not an exact quote the words do sum up how big the man Hulk Hogan was to the sport of wrestling and how he changed it forever. We have 22 of the Hulkster's greatest matches including his numerous Wrestlemania title matches.

Disc 1

-Jimmy Hart and ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund host this look at Hogan's career and offer their views on how Hulk's time in the business evolved over time. They talk before each match and do offer some good candid comments and insight. Also we get a few short interviews with Hogan, Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels, Jim Ross, John Cena, Ric Flair and others on some key moments
of what Hulk has done to make this business as big as it is.

-9/13/80, vs. Andre The Giant: It was more of a teaser for their future Wrestlemania III 6 1/2 years later, but it was a decent match Andre shoved Hulk around and it also showed Hogan's strength as he slammed Andre and even busted him open at one point. 5/10

-4/24/83, AWA Championship Match, vs. Nick Bockwinkel (Champion): The crowd was way behind Hulk during this match and so badly wanted him to win the title. Nick made him look very good while also getting in some good shots thanks to his manager Bobby Heenan, while Hulk just beat up Bockwinkel and used lots of power moves. While the ref was down Nick slaps on a sleeper but Hogan flips him over the top rope onto the floor. Hogan hits the leg drop, the ref counts to three and we have a new AWA champion...... until Hulk is DQ'd becuase he threw Nick over the top rope, so Bockwinkel remains the champ. 8/10. The crowd was very, very pissed about this and started throwing stuff into the ring, Hulk responded by knocking out both Nick and Heenan.

-1/23/84, MSG, WWE Championship Match, vs. Iron Sheik (Champion): Its the famous match that started Hulkamania, Hogan took it to Sheik right away and besides two minutes Hogan was the dominate force in this match. He hulked up and hits the leg drop, makes the cover and wins his first WWE title, which he would go on to hold for 4 years. 8/10.

(Available on the History of the WWE Championship)

-9/22/84, MSG, WWE Championship Match, vs. Big John Studd: Not a very good one here, Studd was never much in WWE in my opinion, he had some ablilty but wasn't the best big man even at this time. He beat down Hogan, and kept him on the mat early on, Hulk did punch and kick his way back into the match, but Studd put him back down, even busted Hulk open. Hogan went nuts after this, hammering him on the outside, but Studd got back into the ring and was declared the winner by count out, of course he didn't win the title. 5/10.

-2/18/85, War To Settle The Score, WWE Championship Match, vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper: To call this a match would be just a flat out lie, as it was a brawl from the very start. But boy was it an intense contest, I think you could count the amount of wrestling holds used on one hand, it was so out of control and so much interference they couldn't even declare a winner. 8/10.

(Available on Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80's & Born to Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story)

-3/31/85, Wrestlemania, w/ Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff: The very first main event that of course wasn't a great match but it had fantstic energy from all involved and also from the crowd. Special referee Pat Patterson had his hands full and Jimmy Snuka and Bob Orton both got involved at the end where Orton accidentaly knocked out Orndorff and Hogan makes the cover for the win. 8/10.

(Availaible on The True Story of Wrestlmania & Wrestlemania Anthology Vol. 1)

-4/7/86, Wrestlemania II, Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship, vs. King Kong Bundy: Its not a bad match, but its typical of Hogan vs. any big man. Hogan had some bad ribs coming into this match and Bundy targeted them with splashes and kicks in the corner. Hogan was of course able to make his comeback, even slamming the near 500lb Bundy and Hulk climbed out of the cage to the floor to retain his title. 6/10. Nice post match segment where Hogan got his hands on Bobby Heenan even slamming him into the cage a couple of times.

(Available on History of the WWE Championship & Wrestlemania Vol. 1)

-8/28/86, The Big Event, WWE Championship Match, vs. ""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff: Both men just brawl with each other in the opening minutes and the pace doesn't really slow down from here as this was a personal match for Hogan after Paul tried to break Hulk's neck in recent months. The action spills outside and back in the ring as Orndorff takes it to the Hulkster targeting Hulk's neck. Paul had a cover on Hogan but ref came to and DQ'd Orndorff after he intenionally ran into him. 8/10. Nice brawl afterwards, with Hogan running Orndorff off.

-3/29/87, Wrestlemania III, WWE Championship Match, vs. Andre The Giant: The main event that had everyone glued to the ring or the screen. Not a great technical bout as Andre was near the end of his career and Hogan who was always very entertaining was limited in the ring. Hogan ended up bringing the crowd to its feet when he slammed Andre, hit the leg drop and made the cover to end Andre's undefeated streak. 8/10.

(Available on History of WWE Championship, The True Story of Wrestlemania & Wrestlemania Vol. 1)

Extras on Disc 1

-Hogan talks about his early days in wrestling: Pretty good stuff here as he almost quit the business for good, which love or hate him its a good thing he didn't.

-Iron Sheik talks about his match against Hogan: We hear from Sheik who says he was offered $100,000 to take the title to the AWA by his trainer Verne Gagne. But Sheik said he wouldn't do it, good story here.

Disc 2

-4/2/89, Wrestlemania V, WWE Championship Match, vs. Randy Savage (Champion): Probably Hogan's best opponent was Randy Savage and this match was no exception. Randy made Hulk look great and there was the usual hulking up and all the antics both men are famous for. There's a good mix of wrestling and brawling as Hogan was looking to exact revenge on Savage for all the jealousy Randy showed when they were teaming up. Great match that saw Hogan hit the leg drop and make the cover to win his second WWE title. 10/10.

(Also available on Wrestlemania Anthology Vol. 1 & Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection)

-4/1/90, Wrestlemania VI, Title for Title Match, vs. The Ultimate Warrior (I.C. Champion): In a rare moment two very popular wrestlers faced off in the main event of Wrestlemania. Its a classic in the sense it was great to see the crowd so split, but the match wasn't really much more than each man getting their spots in, though they did keep the crowd pumped throughout. Hogan misses the leg drop and Warrior hits his splash and covers Hogan for 3 to win the world title. Its a great time capsule for sure. 9/10.

(Available on The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior, Wrestlemania Vol. 1 & History of the WWE Championship)

-3/24/91, Wrestlemania VII, WWE Championship Match, vs. Sgt. Slaughter: Quite an intense title match here, Hogan beat up Sarge early on and of course Slaughter had to resort to some dirty tacttics to gain the advantage. He did bust Hogan open pretty badly and this was a good back and forth match that saw Hogan finally hit the leg drop and make the cover to win the title. 8/10.

(Available on Wrestlemania Vol. 1)

-12/3/91, Tuesday In Texas, WWE Championship Match, vs. The Undertaker (Champion): Just before this event at Survivor Series, Undertaker won the title thanks to some help from Ric Flair and a steel chair, so now we have the rematch. Hogan ran to the ring and attacked Taker right away, even taking the big man off his feet, but he didn't stay down. Taker came back choking out Hulk and chopping his throat and doing his famous walking the ropes before hitting a fist to the shoulder. Flair comes down to ringside but the interference backfires as Taker gets hit with a chair then with the urn, which Hogan uses the ashes from and rolls up Taker to regain the title. 8/10.

(Available on Tombstone: History of the Undertaker)

-7/17/94, WCW Bash At The Beach, WCW Championship Match, vs. Ric Flair (Champion): After over a year of not being in the ring Hulk Hogan came to WCW and his first match was against Ric Flair. This was probably Hogan's greatest wrestling match as he pulled out some good wrestling holds, while Flair sold like crazy to Hulk and also worked on his leg to set up for the figure four leg lock. Its a good long match where Hogan ended up hitting the leg drop and covered Flair to win the world title. 10/10.

(Available on Hulk Still Rules & Rise and Fall of WCW)

-7/7/96, WCW Bash At The Beach, The Formation of the NWO: We see the final minutes of the Outsiders vs. Sting & Savage, then Hogan comes down, hits Savage with a leg drop and turns heel. What followed was one of Hogan's best promo's ever as he cut down the fans and everyone who booed him and told them to stick it. 10/10 as a segment.

(Available on NWO: Back In Black)

-8/10/96, WCW Hog Wild, WCW Championship Match, vs. The Giant (Champion): Very infamous match that was actually not too bad but was typical of his matches against big guys. Giant used a lot of power moves while Hogan tried every dirty trick to win the title, Giant even hulked up and hit the leg drop, he also fought off Hall and Nash but Hogan hit Giant with the title belt and made the cover to win the match and the title. 6/10.

-12/28/97, Starrcade, WCW Championship Match, vs. Sting: After nearly a year build-up this was the result, a sluggish, boring and badly paced match. The crowd did go nuts for Sting when he came out, as this was the first time he would wrestle an actual match in about 15 months. As said before this wasn't a very good main event, its like both guys didn't really seem to try, the attempted screwjob finish was botched as the referee was supposed to count fast with Hogan covering Sting and special enforcer Bret Hart was supposed to call the ref on it. Problem is the ref counted normally so Bret looked dumb for taking over and restarting the match. Sting ends up locking on the Scorpion Death Lock and Hogan gives up as Sting wins the WCW title. 4/10.

(Available on Starrcade: The Essential Collection)

Disc 3

-11/14/01, XWF, vs. Curt Henning: Not a great one here, Henning does some good selling to Hulk and also gets in some good moves, but its the usual hulking up then a leg drop and he makes the cover to win the match. 5/10.

-3/17/02, Wrestlemania X8, Icon vs. Icon, vs. The Rock: Should've been the main event as both guys had the crowd in the palm of their hand. The crowd reaction did make this match seem a whole lot better than it honestly was, not that it was terrible or even average but its not an all time classic in my opinion. Hogan gets such a huge reaction that The Rock has to heel on the crowd, no matter what the announcers said it was not a mixed response. After hulking up and hitting the leg drop for 2, Hogan misses a second leg drop, Rock hits his third Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow for the win. 9/10, a couple of extra points for the crowd's constant energy.

(Available on The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment)

-4/21/02, Backlash, WWE Undisputed Championship Match, vs. Triple H (Champion): Its not a bad one here, though you could tell Trips was taking it a lot slower cause of Hogan, though both did get some good moves in. Hulk hit a diamond cutter and Trips worked Hogan over on the outside nailing a suplex on the mat and beat down the hulkster, also targeting his bad knee with a figure four leg lock. There's interference from Chris Jericho and Undertaker, the latter who hits Triple H with a chair shot and after disposing of him Hogan hits the leg drop and makes the cover to win the match and the Undisputed title. 6/10.

-7/4/02, Smackdown, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, w/Edge vs. Billy & Chuck: Good one here that saw Hogan hit his usual spots, while Edge did most of the heavy lifting. Billy & Chuck did display some good tag team wrestling as well and almost had the match won, but there was a double boot then two leg drops as Edge made the cover to win the tag titles with his childhood idol. 7/10.

(Available on The Best of Smackdown, 1999-2009)

-3/30/03, Wrestlemania XIX, Street Fight, vs. Vince McMahon: I personally enjoyed this match, as both guys did work hard though Vince did the best in selling to Hulk and making the crowd hate him so much. There were some good weapon usage, including a vicious chair shot Hogan gave Vince on the outside, but the best spot was Vince hitting a leg drop off the ladder onto Hulk through the announce table, soon after we get a very creepy shot of Vince rising up from the floor with a pipe in hand. While both were down in the ring, Roddy Piper makes a shocking appearance and hits Hogan with the pipe, but he won't stay down. Hogan ends up hitting three leg drops and makes the cover to win this intense match, 9/10.

(Available on McMahon)

-4/2/05, Hogan's WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony: Very good speech by Hogan as he recalls his career and tells some good stories about his time in wrestling. Also to the fans who kept chanting ""One More Match"", he says ""Never say never."" 10/10 as a segment.

-8/21/05, Summerslam, Legend Vs. Icon, vs. Shawn Michaels: Not bad, but kinda sad to see HBK just flop around and oversell to Hogan, Shawn did get in some good moves but he was really just a guy for Hulk to hit his spots and beat him up. Hogan of course hits the leg drop and makes the cover to win the match. 7/10.

Bonus Disc (If you buy the copy that was available at Wal-Mart)

-3/24/80, MSG, vs. Tito Santana: A decent one here that saw Hogan use his power against the smaller Santana, while Tito used quickness to wear down the bigger Hulk. After a huge suplex Hogan made the cover and won the match. 6/10.

-8/8/81, AWA, Handicap Match vs. Sonny Rogers & Chuck Greenly: Mainly a total squash though Greenly does work on Hulk's arm for a few moments. Hogan does lock on an impressive double bearhug and both give up and Hulk wins. 4/10.

-1/4/86, Saturday Night's Main Event, WWE Championship Match, vs. Terry Funk: Its a good one here, that see Hulk take it to Funk early on and after couple of moves Terry uses some wrist tape to choke out Hogan. As Funk is distracted by the ref, Hulk hits a clothesline and makes the cover to win. 6/10.

-3/12/88, Saturday Night's Main Event, vs. ""King"" Harley Race: From the outset Race hits a few headbutts, but Hulk comes back, rips the shirt and just clotheslines Harley even onto a table on the outside. Race regains the advantage after Hulk is distracted by Bobby Heenan and he hits some good suplexes and knee drops, Harley goes for a splash onto the table but misses. After a headbutt from the top by Harley, Hulk of course hulks up, hits the leg drop and pins Race. 7/10.

-Hulk Hogan Wins the 1990 Royal Rumble: Basically just from when Hogan enters the match and he cleans house, eliminating many people including the Warrior, which would lead to their match at Wrestlemania just two months after. 7/10, for what is shown.

-8/27/90, Summerslam, w/Big Bossman vs. Earthquake w/Dino Bravo: Right after Wrestlemania Earthquake injured Hulk's ribs putting him out of action for a few months, so we have Hogan looking for revenge and the question is are the ribs fully healed. Hulk does attack Earthquake early on, then all four men are in the ring, Quake then targets the ribs, locking on a Boston Crab and a massive bearhug. After he hits the Big One, Hogan hulks up hits the leg drop, but Jimmy hart interferes and gets launched at Earthquake who goes to the outside. We end up having a countout as Hogan wins. 7/10. Nice post match where Hogan is locked in a chokehold, Bossman comes in and has to hit Quake three times with a chair before he released the hold.

-10/3/05, Raw Homecoming, ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund Interviews Hulk Hogan: We get an in-ring promo where Hogan talks about how he would gladly face Shawn Michaels in a rematch (though anyone who knows the story behind that knows Hogan played some politics to avoid that). Also he wonders what would happen if he and Stone Cold Steve Austin ever faced off (which again the story goes Hogan said he wouldn't lose to Austin and Steve has also said he wouldn't wrestle Hulk due to his backstage politics). Not a great way to end the DVD in my opinion.

While it doesn't have all his greatest matches, it has some good ones and is a good DVD set to have if you're a Hogan fan. But as you can see most of these matches are available on other collections and while getting a bonus disc is always cool, the fourth disc doesn't have a bunch of great matches just a couple of decent ones.",1316390400,3,16914,4.463058976020739

It's one of my all time favorite gimmicks and Harley is my favorite portrayer. Sorry Lawler. So since the WWE tends to make us forget wrestlers they didn't create I have to rely on buying sets I might not buy otherwise to see some of my favorites. I.E. Harley Race, Rick Rude, Honky Tonk Man. So even though I like Hogan I essentially bought this for one match. Hogan vs Race from SNME. I like the whole set though. It features great matches and covers hogan through his entire career. Even a match against Curt Hennig(another one of my favorites) in the now defunct XWF. Hulkamaniacs alike will love this set. For those of you wanting to see the Harley Race match it's on the fourth disc which is a bonus disc. I don't think the 4 disc version was available everywhere.

He got by on the fact that he was in Rocky III, and just happened to be in the right place at the right time. His skills are horrendous, and his opponents made him look larger than life. 20 years later at near 60, Hogan still tries to hang on to his cult status any way he can. Buy this for nostalgia, but hopefully Hogan will fade into the sunset finally to give the American public a break from having to look hat his half mullet.",1228176000,7,576,4.017391304347826

Now I'm not the biggest fan when it comes to his matches or his ""politics"" in the wrestling world but I can't deny that he's one of the biggest (if not THE BIGGEST) icon in sports entertainment/professional wrestling of all time...HULK HOGAN as ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund & Jimmy Hart (who wore the old Hogan WCW jacket he had) host this match anthology set.  You'll hear from Hogan himself throughout the presentation regarding some subjects such as leaving the WWWF, coming back to the WWE, WCW, what happened before his match with The Rock, and how his character saved his life while also hearing thoughts & memories of Hogan from other WWE talent & past associates like Greg Gagne, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, Vince McMahon, Rob Van Dam, Edge, Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Ross, Ric Flair, Eric Bischoff, Big Show, and Shawn Michaels.

Matches Include:
vs. Andre The Giant - This match itself is really short as it showed how evenly matched both men were from the shoving contest to trading slams against each other but the real highlight was Hogan putting Andre down & making him bleed.
""Championship Wrestling"" Sept. 80
[Legends Of Wrestling: Andre The Giant & Iron Sheik]

vs. AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel - Hogan came in so full of momentum & hot off the crowd that Nick kept going outside & staying close to the ropes to stall in the early moments before Hulk got his hands on Nick showing his power tossing him around & taking him down with forearms & shoulder block as Nick was able to get some offense in with knees to the gut only for Hogan to return it & more.  Nick was able to eventually ground Hogan with a front facelock & choke as they traded momentum with Hogan giving back every punch that Nick gave him & later Hogan doing a running powerslam with Nick attempting the same thing before Nick relied on various sleeper holds in an attempt to ware Hogan down.  This was a really good match where you saw how popular ""Hulkamania"" was before Vince McMahon as Hogan had the crowd in his hand with everything he did while Bockwinkle was the definition of a classic heel wrestler for that time.
""AWA Super Sunday"" Apr. 83

vs. WWE Champion Iron Sheik - Honestly, I can try to summarize this match but what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years as it was pretty short & sweet with Gorilla Monsoon summarizing it perfectly, ""Hulkamania Is Here!""
""MSG"" Jan. '84

WWE Championship Match vs. Big John Studd - It was during this time that Studd & his manager Bobby Heenan had an open challenge where they would pay money to whoever would be able to bodyslam Big John Studd.  Hogan was in control early in the match with forearm strikes in the corner only for Studd to take advantage of Hogan being unable to slam him heavily working over the back with various strikes, back breaker, bearhug, and a hard forearm that sent Hogan to the outside where he was eventually busted open which Hogan into a complete rage at the sight of it.  This was your typical Hogan performance against ""giants"" where he was on the defense more than offense building to the big comeback but have to give credit to both men in telling the story of working over the back.
""MSG"" Sept 84

WWE Championship Match vs. Roddy Piper - This was the main event of the big television special held on a new network called MTV that was full of celebrities like sports announcer Bob Costas as the ring announcer, actor Mr. T in the crowd, and musician Cindy Lauper & Dave Wolfe & Capt. Lou Albano in Hogan's corner while Roddy Piper had Bob Orton in his corner with his arm in a sling from his match earlier (which began him wearing the cast on his arm for close to a year).  Both men started right away trading fist with Hogan getting control & even resorting to biting before Piper regained it with kicks to the head & dirty tactics of his own like choking on the ropes & eye rake while Orton tried to get involved only for Hogan to attack his arm causing ally Paul Orndorff to come to ringside in Piper's corner.  This was a straight brawl from start to finish that go so out of hand that the referee was knocked out & security was called to the ring but it did it's job in building towards the very first WrestleMania.

w/Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff - The main event of the very first WrestleMania with Bob Orton & Jimmy Sunka in the corner for their teams, Liberace as the guest timekeeper, baseball personality Billy Martin as the ring announcer, Pat Patterson as the inside referee, and boxing legend Muhammad Ali was the outside enforcer.  Mr. T & Roddy Piper started off trading slaps with T getting some amateur wrestling moves in before all six men would eventually end up in the ring brawling causing Ali to get in the ring to take control.  Hogan was singled out getting worked over both in the ring with double teaming in the corner & on the outside with Piper using a chair before focusing on T keeping him down putting all of their weight on him before eventually all hell broke loose again with the corner men getting involved & eventually being the deciding factor in the match resulting in what was a fun tag match for it's time.

[Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story; True Story Of WrestleMania]

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. King Kong Bundy - I believe this was the debut of the ""big blue"" steel cage that WWE would use for the over the next decade until the ""Attitude Era."" Hogan came into the match with injured ribs as he was dominate early before Bundy was able to target the ribs with various stomps & slams along with ramming them into the cage while also using the tape around Hogan's ribs to choke him. Hogan was able to regain some momentum sending Bundy into the cage busting him open but still wasn't able to keep it as his ribs continued to give out on him with Bundy capitalizing with an Avalanche before Hogan was finally able to ""Hulk Up"" against Bundy. This was your typical ""Hogan"" main event for this time with a special bonus afterwords when he was able to get his hands on Bobby Heenan.
Wrestlemania 2
[History Of The WWE Championship]

WWE Championship Match vs. Paul Orndorff - Former enemies turned allies turned enemies once again as Orndorff jumped Hogan while he was getting checked by the referee as they traded stiff strikes against each other including slamming heads on the apron & ring post.  Hogan was able to gain control with some hard clotheslines before Heenan caused a distraction allowing Orndorff to gain control working over the neck with direct hits to the back of neck & repeatedly pounding on it while also using tactics such as choking & biting while Heenan would get involved himself.  This came off like a fight as both men were giving each other some stiff shots to each other throughout the contest.
The Big Event 86
[Hulk Still Rules]

WWE Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - This was (and arguably still is) the biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. Hogan went for a slam in the opening moments leading to a controversial moment early in the match before Andre continued to beat on Hogan's back to the point where he literally just walked all over him. Whatever momentum Hogan attempted to gain was constantly stopped by Andre causing Hogan to get desperate with a piledriver attempt on the concrete floor only for Andre to again overpower him. The match was your stereotypical ""Hogan"" performance but this was more about the attraction of two giant names in the industry against each other on a huge stage.
Wrestlemania III
[Hulk Still Rules; History Of The WWE Championship; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - ""The Mega Powers Explode"" was the name for this match as Hogan & Savage were friends & tag partners for a year but due to the jealous of Savage over Hogan setup this match with their manager of Elizabeth remaining in a neutral corner as Savage kept going to the outside to break Hogan's momentum & went as far as to put Elizabeth in front of him when Hogan started to chase him on the outside. Hogan went out of his comfort zone against Savage executing moves like a drop toehold into a headlock while Savage also did wrestling himself like countering the hold with a back suplex but also resort to his old tricks of pulling hair & eye poke along causing Hogan to play his game using dirty tactics of his own. They traded momentum throughout the match with Hogan taking as much as he gave like press slamming Savage over the top to the floor while starting to bleed over his eye but Elizabeth kept getting in the way on the outside to the point where the referee had to make a call involving her before Savage would continue to bring the fight doing a top rope double axe handle onto the guardrail along with still taking shortcuts using the ropes & wrist tape to choke Hogan's throat. This was one of the most competitive & aggressive matches during this era of Hogan's run as Savage was able to bring out more of Hogan on a grand stage than others have in the past.
Wrestlemania V
[History Of The WWE Championship; Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection]

WWE Championship Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.
Wrestlemania VI
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; History Of The WWE Championship]

vs. WWE Champion Sgt. Slaughter - This match as this was during the time that the U.S.A. was in the first ""Gulf War"" against Iraq so WWE decided to play off it with Hogan playing the American Hero & Sgt. Slaughter turning heel being a sympathizer to Iraq & also making it clear that he had no issues getting disqualified or counted out in order to regain his title.  Hogan showed his power advantage early powering Slaughter down shoving him down & shoulderblocks while showing no effect of distractions by Gen. Adnan or an attempt at using a chair as he just kept taking it right to him to the point where it seemed like he was more concerned about beating up Slaughter than winning the match.  Hogan went out of his element for a moment opening the door for Slaughter to finally take control using tactics like choking using the cable cords, using Adnan for distractions & extra advantage, and using the chair various times including busting Hogan open while also trying to humiliate Hogan putting the Iraq flag over his body.  This was your typical Hogan performance here but Slaughter did play the part well of a heel who used every dirty tactic in the book knowing that he would keep his title if he got caught.
A few side notes in that Regis Philbin was the guest commentator for this match while there is an audio glitch at the end of the match.
Wrestlemania VII

vs. WWE Champion Undertaker - Undertaker had won the WWE Championship from Hogan a week earlier at Survivor Series with help from Ric Flair resulting in this rematch with President Jack Tunney himself at ringside.  Hogan was jumped coming in only for Hogan to come back & dominate causing Taker to drag Hogan to the outside & choke him down for control along with other offense like his ""old school"" rope walk, face claw, and flying clothesline before Hogan was able to regain control causing all out chaos between the parties in the ring & outside of the ring.

[Hulk Still Rules]

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - Hogan's WCW debut in the dream match against Ric Flair with his old nemesis Sherri in Flair's corner while Jimmy Hart & Mr. T was in Hogan's corner.  Hogan kept knocking Flair down early & even did Flair's strut before Flair retailed by grounding Hogan & pulling his hair to keep him down but Hogan kept catching & fighting off Flair's offense resulting in Sherri causing a distraction for Flair to regain control wearing Hogan down as they traded momentum throughout the entire match match before Hogan's leg was targeted by Flair with Sherri getting more physically involved causing an ally of Hogan's to get involved as well.  This match lived up to the hype given to it at the time.
WCW Bash At The Beach 94
[Hulk Still Rules; Rise & Fall Of WCW]

vs. WCW Champion Giant - Hogan's first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red & yellow colors replaced with black & white. The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of ""cat & mouse"" as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didn't work. Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down & the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant ""hulked up"" on him. The match itself wasn't much but showcased the new heelish in-ring style of Hogan & the continued domination of the nWo.
WCW Hog Wild '96
[nWo: The Revolution]

WCW Championship Match vs. Sting - Over a year in the making here as with Sting's first match (on television) since Fall Brawl the year before with Hogan coming out of the box beating on Sting with punches with Sting responding with dropkicks sending Hogan to the outside before Hogan knocked Sting down & Sting getting right back up after Hogan decided to show off.  The match got taken to the outside with Hogan using Sting's own trademark bat against him while also using the ring post & guardrail before taking the match back into the ring where he was dominate to the point where it looked like he won the match at one point before another figure from Hogan's past appeared to make sure nobody got ""screwed.""  This match will go down as one of the most disappointing main events in history because the in-ring action itself never seemed to leave past first gear (which they made up for in later matches) with the finish itself not being what the people wanted & the fact that it was botched too didn't help matters.  The match wasn't bad but it didn't live up to the hype.
Starrcade 97
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

vs. Curt Hennig - As a side note for those who have no clue what the ""XWF"" was, it was a company ran by Jimmy Hart made up of ex-WWE/WCW/ECW talent who weren't working for WWE at the time or still under contract with Time Warner through WCW but never off the ground past a small set of ""pilot"" TV tapings (in the same studios that WCW used to tape ""Pro"" & ""Worldwide"" which we now know as the TNA ""Impact Zone"") in hopes of securing a TV deal which didn't happen with Hogan commenting before this match on how the match with Hennig actually came to be.  This was really nothing special past your typical Hogan performance of him showing his power & being dominate throughout the match with Hennig only selling the offense & Bobby Heenan at ringside taking a hit for the team as well.
""XWF"" Nov. 01

vs. The Rock - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords. Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow. Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.
WrestleMania X8
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Triple H - A month after his legendary match against The Rock, Hogan returned to his red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" persona & recieved a shot at the WWE Championship.  Both men shoved the other into the corner after lockup attempts followed by a test of strength which ended in a stalemate before Triple H took advantage & Hogan reversing the momentum.  The match went to the outside with Triple H going into the guardrail & suplexed while Hogan going into the steel steps before the match went back into the ring with Hogan's leg targeted with various elbows & a figure four before various people who had an interest in this match arrived to make their presence known resulting in various chairshots & one man left bleeding.  Jerry Lawler coined this as ""battle of the biceps"" which was true in some cases as both men showcased their strength throughout the contest.
Backlash 02

w/Hulk Hogan vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck - This was a dream situation for Edge as his childhood hero was Hulk Hogan to the point where he got the ticket to see him at WrestleMania VI & not only does he get the opportunity to team with him but it was also against the Tag Team Champions on the Fourth Of July holiday complete with Hogan coming out waving the American flag & his classic theme of ""Real American"" (Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"" was his regular theme during this time). They were dominate early on against both men causing Billy & Chuck to single out Edge working him over with fast tags & double teaming with even Rico getting involved building to the eventual hot tag to Hogan. This was all about Edge having his special emotional moment with his childhood hero.
""SmackDown"" July '02
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary; Edge: Decade Of Decadance]

Street Fight Match vs. Mr. McMahon - ""20 Years In The Making"" was the sub-title for this match as it was promoter vs. superstar here that started off with Vince slapping Hogan & eventually gaining control working over the arm using moves like a hammerlock & objects like the ringpost while also doing dirty tactics like a low blow before Hogan was able to get the advantage back with chairshots that not only busted Vince open but also someone else who got in the way of the crossfire.  Vince gave a receipt for the chairshot himself along with using whatever he could against Hogan from a monitor to a ladder at ringside before Hogan gave his own receipt for what Vince did earlier when someone made an appearance who had his history of hatred for both men.  Knowing who was involved in this match, it wasn't a wrestling classic but very entertaining with one moment to look out for was when the camera had a close-up of Vince's face rising up from the apron as he looked like the devil himself.
WrestleMania XIX
[McMahon]

vs. Shawn Michaels - ""Icon vs. Legend"" was the tagline for this match but anyone who knows the story behind the backstage politics between these two knows this match went deeper than that.  Hogan was dominate with Shawn being tossed all over the place from in & out of the ring to off the turnbuckle onto the top rope with none of Shawn's tactics having any true effect on Hogan as he kept coming using whatever he could on the outside from the ringpost to the spanish announce table.  Shawn was finally able to get some momentum busting Hogan open & kept going after Hogan to the point where the referee had to force him off but still went on the offensive with his trademark moves including a flashback to his controversial match in Montreal.  There's a lot to be said about this match based off what I mentioned earlier in regards to the backstage politics but I'm not exactly sure what to say about the in-ring action itself because Shawn was ""bumping"" his butt off to sell Hogan's offense but also doing it was in such an extreme manner that if came off as ""overselling"" that you never saw with any of Hogan's other opponents while never seeing Shawn act that way in the ring with anyone else from Mr. McMahon to Great Khali so there really isn't any other way to phrase this match past, ""it is what it is, take it or leave it.""
Summerslam 05

(Bonus Disc) vs. Tito Santana - This was from Hogan's first run back in the WWWF as a heel with ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie in his corner while Santana was one half of the tag team champions.  Hogan jumped Tito from behind whipping him hard into corners along with offense moves like the back elbow & clothesline before Tito was able to counter another whip attempt fighting back with punches attempting to work over Hogan's arm & ribs.  This was just an average match.
""MSG"" Mar. 80

(Bonus Disc) vs. Sonny Rogers & Chuck Greenly - Jimmy Valant was Hogan's manager here while also adding some of his own opinions on the commentary as well as Hogan easily overpowered both men both individually & together easily pushing them around while applying holds like a double bearhug.  Nothing past a dominate squash.
""AWA"" Aug. 81

(Bonus Disc) WWE Championship Match vs. Terry Funk - Due to the constant interference by Jimmy Hart in their previous encounter, Hogan got the assistance of Junkyard Dog in his corner who chased around Jimmy & forced him to sit in a chair at ringside.  Hogan easily overpowered Funk early on easily countering & reversing his offense while also having some entertaining moments like running over Funk when crossing the ropes & the way Funk fell out of the ring that just had you just couldn't help but laugh at while Jimmy Hart had to get involved in order to give Funk an advantage while also using dirty tactics like using the wrist tape & branding iron to keep the advantage.  This was a very entertaining match.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Jan. 86
[Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event]

(Bonus Disc) vs. Harley Race - Hogan was out looking for revenge against Bobby Heenan for selling the contract of Andre The Giant to Ted Dibiase, resulting in Hogan losing the WWE Championship in controversy, and that showed as he went right after Heenan only for Race to jump Hogan coming into the ring with no effect as Hogan used his taped fist to punch Race while also using whatever he could get his hands on like the ringpost & choking using the tape on his fist while continuing to brawl on the floor.  Heenan caused a distraction allowing Race to finally get some control using a piledriver & an attempt at a big splash through an announce table that unfortunately would have a long term effect on Race.  This match served it's purpose in showing a more aggressive dominate Hogan than ever after losing the championship but is more remembered for the injury Harley Race suffered via the big splash through a table that caused him to be out of action for close to a year.

(Bonus Disc) vs. Earthquake - This was Hogan's comeback match against the man who not only put him out of action for several months but also attacked his friend, Tugboat, taking him out of Hogan's corner for this match who was replaced by Big Boss Man while Dino Bravo & Jimmy Hart was in Earthquake's corner.  Hogan came in hot but attempted to slam him early which didn't work allowing Earthquake to work over Hogan's back but Hogan kept fighting to the point where he even knocked Earthquake off his feet for the first time before chaos broke loose with Boss Man & Hogan working together to not only work over Earthquake but Bravo as well.  Bravo was able to help Earthquake regain the advantage & continued to work over Hogan's back to the point where Hogan ended up ripping the referees shirt trying to escape from a bearhug & fell over when attempting another bodyslam before ""hulking up"" & slamming Earthquake not only in the ring but through a table on the outside as well.  This was your typical Hogan match against a ""giant"" where he kept trying to overcome the power & size throughout the match before finally making his comeback.

2529644,5,B000EQ5SL6,"A couple years ago I purchased the ""Hulk still Rules"" DVD. It was pretty good, but it lacked alot of the Hulksters great matches (Like the wrestlemania match with ultimate warrior). Not only does this DVD has several better matches, but Mean gene and Jimmy Hart (and various other superstars) introduce every match. This DVD is a must for classic wrestling fans who remember WWF prime time mondays (before monday night RAW). I am dissapointed that this collection doesn't include the Sid Justice VS Hogan match, but I can't complain because there are enough great matches here to make up for it.

I hope the WWE decides to release more of these superstar compilations. I would like to see Mr Perfect, Owen Hart, Yokozuna, Kurt Angle, Sid Justice, Randy Savage sets released as well. Another great DVD set would be an African American wrestler set with Junkyard dog, Viscera, Papa Shungo, Farooq, Booker T, and Mark Henry.",1192147200,,921,4.86624203821656
2529645,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",1172102400,,1695,4.508196721311475
2529646,5,B000EQ5SL6,"This DVD set was very well done and I found it fitting that it was hosted by Jimmy Hart and Mean Gene Okerlund. They really did a lot to impress upon the viewer just how amazing Hulk Hogan's career was and how much he has done for the business. I have two complaints though:

I noticed that there are very few new Hogan commentaries. The majority of his comments were taken from the Hulk Still Rules set.

And they changed his entrance themes. I know for a fact that he NEVER used Real American while he was in the AWA and yet it is played after his match with Nick Bockwinkle. Real American wasn't recorded until 1985. They changed the NWO theme from WM18 as well. Finally, they removed Voodoo Chile from all of his matches after his return to WWE and replaced them with Real American making it seem odd, to the un-informed at least, that Tazz gets excited when he came out to it on the July 4th Smackdown! where he teamed with Edge.

Overall though this set was FANTASTIC! With the exception of bathroom and food breaks I watched this straight for ten hours and and made it to the end of the third disc. I highly recommend this to any fan. I am a big fan of fast-paced, technical wrestling (Daniels, Benoit, etc) but I marked out for this big time. However, if you are looking for a DVD that has matches AND gives you insight into Hulk Hogan's history, you're better off purchasing Hulk Still Rules.",1168560000,2,1401,4.360153256704981
2529647,4,B000EQ5SL6,"I bought the wwe championship dvd for a few matchs with Hogan because he was such a big legend when I was growing up but I was kinda upset that they only had about 4 of his matches and out of those 4 only two or 3 of them was good.  I really wished they would have included some of his World championship matches off this match I am particularly talking about his match with Slaughter which was a classic match because both men was known to be patriots at one time but at that time Slaughter was potrayed in the WWE as an anti American and Hogan was portrayed as the all American Hero still it was one of the best World Championship matches of all time.  I also see on this dvd the first match that he and Andre has together which should be classic since in that match Andre was a good guy and Hogan was a bad guy.  I only wished they would have waited a bit longer on putting out this dvd and put the match he had with Orton on it since Orton can have a good match with anyone in my opinion.  But in some ways I do wish the WWE would stop making dvds on Hogan and focus on some of the lesser known stars in the 80s like Dibase, Steamboat, and Snuka whom I'm sure Vince will have to admit helped Hogan build the WWE.",1163116800,3,1216,3.971311475409836
2529648,4,B000EQ5SL6,"This dvd has plenty of exciting matches. But how many times are we going to see Hogan Vs. Iron Sheik, Andre the Giant, Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair from WCW days. I must have these  same matches in 5 other dvds. I think the wwe should review and choose matches that fans have not seen 50 times already!!!If you don't already have the prevoius DVD, ""Hulk still Rules"", then this will be an excellent buy. If you already have it, skip this.",1163030400,3,437,4.395061728395062
2529649,2,B000EQ5SL6,"I was disappointed with the WWE's latest (and probably last) offering on the legacy of the Hulkster. This ""Ultimate"" Anthology, in my opinion, was created solely to milk the very last drop from the very sore nipple of Hulkamania.

Mean Gene Okerlund and Jimmy Hart are your hosts on all 3 discs, introducing us fans to each match. And they completely lack any charisma whatsoever. It's almost like Vince McMahon himself had a gun pointed at them off camera to make them read off a cue card. Both of them must have said ""You are absolutely right"" about 100 times. Very irritating.

I personally think the WWE should have gone above and beyond to make this the best DVD they ever created. Without the Hulk, chances are the WWE wouldn't be what it is today. But, the best WWE DVD collection remains the Ric Flair Collection, which was done first class, and did not have the cheesy introductions to each match. I really could have done without Mean Gene and Jimmy Hart. Besides, anybody who remembers the Hulk from his WWF (now WWE) days in particular, will recall Jimmy Hart was a heel manager, and had nothing to do with Hogan besides putting his sideshow freak stable up against him. But, Hogan joined WCW with Hart as his manager, plus I think they are even related so that's how Jimmy got on here.

ANYWAY....

The set they are talking on is a generic WWE set, like from their WWF Confidential show. No real connection to the Hulk at all (no red and yellow backdrop, no pictures of Hulk...etc). I think since they probably only paid Mean Gene and Jimmy Hart a small fee (and who probably were eating out of KFC garbage bins the night before), they could have spent a bit more on the set.

Enough about the presentation. The meat of the Anthology is the matches. We are treated to some of Hogans relevant matches over the course of his career, but it is more of a spotlight on his biggest feuds, not necessarily a spotlight on his best matches. One match which was sorely missing was Hogans steel cage fight with The Big Bossman from Saturday Nights Main Event in 1986. Who could forget Hogan superplexing the Bossman off the top of the steel cage? Out of all of Hogans big matches, this one sticks out to me as one of his best.

Some of the interviews were new, but all of Hogans comments appear to be recycled from the ""Hulk Still Rules"" DVD. There is little to no special features whatsoever. I was thinking among the three discs that there would be hours of interviews, special content, maybe even a blurb about how Hogan influenced the whole ""Rock N Wrestling"" aspect in the 1980's, including his cartoon show, but...nothing.

The worst match on the DVD is Hogans' 2002 appearance in XWF, which was run by Jimmy Hart. Hogan faced ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig, shortly after having reconstructive knee surgery. Hogan was simply there to make an appearance, but was talked into having a match. What a mistake. Hogan couldn't even go in the ring, and was tuckered out after a few minutes. I've never seen Hogan look worse. And all of this in front of maybe 100 fans. This was clearly added to the disc as a favor to Hogans personal friend, Jimmy Hart.

To add salt to the wounds, I bought the set that included Hogans terrible reality show, ""Hogan Knows Best"". If Hogan knew anything, he'd know that this show sucks and get his old butt and family off TV.

I would have to say that the chances of me buying another Hogan DVD is about the same chance Hogans' hair is going to grow back.

FOR HOGAN BIGGEST FANS ONLY!!",1162944000,3,3515,4.5039246467817895
2529650,3,B000EQ5SL6,"Since I heard about this coming out I couldn't wait to get it, but now that i've got it, it's kind of disapointing.

The 3 discs themselves contain part 1, 2 & 3 of Mene Gene and Jimmy Hart showing us the matches from 1980 to 2006, all that was good, about 6 hours of Hulk Hogan action. But what this anthology lacks is bonus features.

The extras are so poor on this set. Only disc one contains 2 extras, one is 30 second clip of Hogan talking about his father, the other is a 10 second clip of the Iron Sheek going on about god knows what, then thats it! I couldn't even find a hidden extra anywhere!

This is NOT the same as the last Hogan DVD that was released then taken off sheleves due to it being a WWF title. Now that it's a WWE title they have actualy re-done it all, the good thing is at least some of the matches that where previously on the last disc are now in there entirity instead of just highlights. So I did enjoy watching the full Rock VS Hogan DVD, but there isn't even a mention of the rematch the following year!

At least this time around they included Hogan VS the Warrior which even tho everyone knows the outcome, it was still a memory that everyone remembers so well. But I hoped they would include Hogan and Warriors continuation after that when Hogan saved Warrior, then Warrior saved Hogan and then they won the Survivor Series together, but none of that is mentioned.

Nothing mentioned about Hogan winning the Royal Rumble after he slammed Earthquake, nothing about Wrestlemania ? when he took on Sid Justice (Viscious) and the transition from WWF to WCW is not exactly shown. It just goes from a highlight of the camera exploding in his face against Yokozuna to him taking on Ric Flair. There was a whole silly press confrence at Disneyworld when he joined the WCW, where is that?

I enjoyed watching the WCW stuff tho, I always hated WCW but since it's demise and Hulks return, I took an interest in knowing what he did during that run in the late 90's. But i strongly think it could do with a lot more WCW stuff. In particular, his fued with the Ultimate Warrior again and Randy Savage. And also the return of HULK hogan in the end of WCW's days. It all seems to end with the Hogan VS Sting thing.

Honestly, I don't think you can call this an anthology, to do that, you'd need about 10 discs to cover his 20-30 year carreer.

Here's to hopeing we see a better release in future packed with so much Hogan material you wanna puke on your vitamins, pray that it's almost over and be happy that whatch gonna do when a sh**load of extras is shown to you.",1162771200,4,2586,4.284836065573771
2529651,5,B000EQ5SL6,"EDIT: I updated this review in 2013

Now I'm not the biggest fan when it comes to his matches or his ""politics"" in the wrestling world but I can't deny that he's one of the biggest (if not THE BIGGEST) icon in sports entertainment/professional wrestling of all time...HULK HOGAN as ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund & Jimmy Hart (who wore the old Hogan WCW jacket he had) host this match anthology set.  You'll hear from Hogan himself throughout the presentation regarding some subjects such as leaving the WWWF, coming back to the WWE, WCW, what happened before his match with The Rock, and how his character saved his life while also hearing thoughts & memories of Hogan from other WWE talent & past associates like Greg Gagne, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, Vince McMahon, Rob Van Dam, Edge, Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Ross, Ric Flair, Eric Bischoff, Big Show, and Shawn Michaels.

Matches Include:
vs. Andre The Giant - This match itself is really short as it showed how evenly matched both men were from the shoving contest to trading slams against each other but the real highlight was Hogan putting Andre down & making him bleed.
""Championship Wrestling"" Sept. 80
[Legends Of Wrestling: Andre The Giant & Iron Sheik]

vs. AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel - Hogan came in so full of momentum & hot off the crowd that Nick kept going outside & staying close to the ropes to stall in the early moments before Hulk got his hands on Nick showing his power tossing him around & taking him down with forearms & shoulder block as Nick was able to get some offense in with knees to the gut only for Hogan to return it & more.  Nick was able to eventually ground Hogan with a front facelock & choke as they traded momentum with Hogan giving back every punch that Nick gave him & later Hogan doing a running powerslam with Nick attempting the same thing before Nick relied on various sleeper holds in an attempt to ware Hogan down.  This was a really good match where you saw how popular ""Hulkamania"" was before Vince McMahon as Hogan had the crowd in his hand with everything he did while Bockwinkle was the definition of a classic heel wrestler for that time.
""AWA Super Sunday"" Apr. 83

vs. WWE Champion Iron Sheik - Honestly, I can try to summarize this match but what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years as it was pretty short & sweet with Gorilla Monsoon summarizing it perfectly, ""Hulkamania Is Here!""
""MSG"" Jan. '84
[Hulk Still Rules; History Of The WWE Championship; Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's]

WWE Championship Match vs. Big John Studd - It was during this time that Studd & his manager Bobby Heenan had an open challenge where they would pay money to whoever would be able to bodyslam Big John Studd.  Hogan was in control early in the match with forearm strikes in the corner only for Studd to take advantage of Hogan being unable to slam him heavily working over the back with various strikes, back breaker, bearhug, and a hard forearm that sent Hogan to the outside where he was eventually busted open which Hogan into a complete rage at the sight of it.  This was your typical Hogan performance against ""giants"" where he was on the defense more than offense building to the big comeback but have to give credit to both men in telling the story of working over the back.
""MSG"" Sept 84

WWE Championship Match vs. Roddy Piper - This was the main event of the big television special held on a new network called MTV that was full of celebrities like sports announcer Bob Costas as the ring announcer, actor Mr. T in the crowd, and musician Cindy Lauper & Dave Wolfe & Capt. Lou Albano in Hogan's corner while Roddy Piper had Bob Orton in his corner with his arm in a sling from his match earlier (which began him wearing the cast on his arm for close to a year).  Both men started right away trading fist with Hogan getting control & even resorting to biting before Piper regained it with kicks to the head & dirty tactics of his own like choking on the ropes & eye rake while Orton tried to get involved only for Hogan to attack his arm causing ally Paul Orndorff to come to ringside in Piper's corner.  This was a straight brawl from start to finish that go so out of hand that the referee was knocked out & security was called to the ring but it did it's job in building towards the very first WrestleMania.

w/Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff - The main event of the very first WrestleMania with Bob Orton & Jimmy Sunka in the corner for their teams, Liberace as the guest timekeeper, baseball personality Billy Martin as the ring announcer, Pat Patterson as the inside referee, and boxing legend Muhammad Ali was the outside enforcer.  Mr. T & Roddy Piper started off trading slaps with T getting some amateur wrestling moves in before all six men would eventually end up in the ring brawling causing Ali to get in the ring to take control.  Hogan was singled out getting worked over both in the ring with double teaming in the corner & on the outside with Piper using a chair before focusing on T keeping him down putting all of their weight on him before eventually all hell broke loose again with the corner men getting involved & eventually being the deciding factor in the match resulting in what was a fun tag match for it's time.

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. King Kong Bundy - I believe this was the debut of the ""big blue"" steel cage that WWE would use for the over the next decade until the ""Attitude Era."" Hogan came into the match with injured ribs as he was dominate early before Bundy was able to target the ribs with various stomps & slams along with ramming them into the cage while also using the tape around Hogan's ribs to choke him. Hogan was able to regain some momentum sending Bundy into the cage busting him open but still wasn't able to keep it as his ribs continued to give out on him with Bundy capitalizing with an Avalanche before Hogan was finally able to ""Hulk Up"" against Bundy. This was your typical ""Hogan"" main event for this time with a special bonus afterwords when he was able to get his hands on Bobby Heenan.

[History Of The WWE Championship]

WWE Championship Match vs. Paul Orndorff - Former enemies turned allies turned enemies once again as Orndorff jumped Hogan while he was getting checked by the referee as they traded stiff strikes against each other including slamming heads on the apron & ring post.  Hogan was able to gain control with some hard clotheslines before Heenan caused a distraction allowing Orndorff to gain control working over the neck with direct hits to the back of neck & repeatedly pounding on it while also using tactics such as choking & biting while Heenan would get involved himself.  This came off like a fight as both men were giving each other some stiff shots to each other throughout the contest.
The Big Event 86
[Hulk Still Rules]

WWE Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - This was (and arguably still is) the biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. Hogan went for a slam in the opening moments leading to a controversial moment early in the match before Andre continued to beat on Hogan's back to the point where he literally just walked all over him. Whatever momentum Hogan attempted to gain was constantly stopped by Andre causing Hogan to get desperate with a piledriver attempt on the concrete floor only for Andre to again overpower him. The match was your stereotypical ""Hogan"" performance but this was more about the attraction of two giant names in the industry against each other on a huge stage.
Wrestlemania III
[Hulk Still Rules; History Of The WWE Championship; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - ""The Mega Powers Explode"" was the name for this match as Hogan & Savage were friends & tag partners for a year but due to the jealous of Savage over Hogan setup this match with their manager of Elizabeth remaining in a neutral corner as Savage kept going to the outside to break Hogan's momentum & went as far as to put Elizabeth in front of him when Hogan started to chase him on the outside. Hogan went out of his comfort zone against Savage executing moves like a drop toehold into a headlock while Savage also did wrestling himself like countering the hold with a back suplex but also resort to his old tricks of pulling hair & eye poke along causing Hogan to play his game using dirty tactics of his own. They traded momentum throughout the match with Hogan taking as much as he gave like press slamming Savage over the top to the floor while starting to bleed over his eye but Elizabeth kept getting in the way on the outside to the point where the referee had to make a call involving her before Savage would continue to bring the fight doing a top rope double axe handle onto the guardrail along with still taking shortcuts using the ropes & wrist tape to choke Hogan's throat. This was one of the most competitive & aggressive matches during this era of Hogan's run as Savage was able to bring out more of Hogan on a grand stage than others have in the past.
Wrestlemania V
[History Of The WWE Championship; Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection]

WWE Championship Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.
Wrestlemania VI
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; History Of The WWE Championship]

vs. WWE Champion Sgt. Slaughter - This match as this was during the time that the U.S.A. was in the first ""Gulf War"" against Iraq so WWE decided to play off it with Hogan playing the American Hero & Sgt. Slaughter turning heel being a sympathizer to Iraq & also making it clear that he had no issues getting disqualified or counted out in order to regain his title.  Hogan showed his power advantage early powering Slaughter down shoving him down & shoulderblocks while showing no effect of distractions by Gen. Adnan or an attempt at using a chair as he just kept taking it right to him to the point where it seemed like he was more concerned about beating up Slaughter than winning the match.  Hogan went out of his element for a moment opening the door for Slaughter to finally take control using tactics like choking using the cable cords, using Adnan for distractions & extra advantage, and using the chair various times including busting Hogan open while also trying to humiliate Hogan putting the Iraq flag over his body.  This was your typical Hogan performance here but Slaughter did play the part well of a heel who used every dirty tactic in the book knowing that he would keep his title if he got caught.
A few side notes in that Regis Philbin was the guest commentator for this match while there is an audio glitch at the end of the match.
Wrestlemania VII

vs. WWE Champion Undertaker - Undertaker had won the WWE Championship from Hogan a week earlier at Survivor Series with help from Ric Flair resulting in this rematch with President Jack Tunney himself at ringside.  Hogan was jumped coming in only for Hogan to come back & dominate causing Taker to drag Hogan to the outside & choke him down for control along with other offense like his ""old school"" rope walk, face claw, and flying clothesline before Hogan was able to regain control causing all out chaos between the parties in the ring & outside of the ring.

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - Hogan's WCW debut in the dream match against Ric Flair with his old nemesis Sherri in Flair's corner while Jimmy Hart & Mr. T was in Hogan's corner.  Hogan kept knocking Flair down early & even did Flair's strut before Flair retailed by grounding Hogan & pulling his hair to keep him down but Hogan kept catching & fighting off Flair's offense resulting in Sherri causing a distraction for Flair to regain control wearing Hogan down as they traded momentum throughout the entire match match before Hogan's leg was targeted by Flair with Sherri getting more physically involved causing an ally of Hogan's to get involved as well.  This match lived up to the hype given to it at the time.

vs. WCW Champion Giant - Hogan's first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red & yellow colors replaced with black & white. The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of ""cat & mouse"" as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didn't work. Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down & the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant ""hulked up"" on him. The match itself wasn't much but showcased the new heelish in-ring style of Hogan & the continued domination of the nWo.
WCW Hog Wild '96
[nWo: The Revolution]

WCW Championship Match vs. Sting - Over a year in the making here as with Sting's first match (on television) since Fall Brawl the year before with Hogan coming out of the box beating on Sting with punches with Sting responding with dropkicks sending Hogan to the outside before Hogan knocked Sting down & Sting getting right back up after Hogan decided to show off.  The match got taken to the outside with Hogan using Sting's own trademark bat against him while also using the ring post & guardrail before taking the match back into the ring where he was dominate to the point where it looked like he won the match at one point before another figure from Hogan's past appeared to make sure nobody got ""screwed.""  This match will go down as one of the most disappointing main events in history because the in-ring action itself never seemed to leave past first gear (which they made up for in later matches) with the finish itself not being what the people wanted & the fact that it was botched too didn't help matters.  The match wasn't bad but it didn't live up to the hype.
Starrcade 97
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

vs. Curt Hennig - As a side note for those who have no clue what the ""XWF"" was, it was a company ran by Jimmy Hart made up of ex-WWE/WCW/ECW talent who weren't working for WWE at the time or still under contract with Time Warner through WCW but never off the ground past a small set of ""pilot"" TV tapings (in the same studios that WCW used to tape ""Pro"" & ""Worldwide"" which we now know as the TNA ""Impact Zone"") in hopes of securing a TV deal which didn't happen with Hogan commenting before this match on how the match with Hennig actually came to be.  This was really nothing special past your typical Hogan performance of him showing his power & being dominate throughout the match with Hennig only selling the offense & Bobby Heenan at ringside taking a hit for the team as well.
""XWF"" Nov. 01

vs. The Rock - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords. Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow. Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Triple H - A month after his legendary match against The Rock, Hogan returned to his red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" persona & recieved a shot at the WWE Championship.  Both men shoved the other into the corner after lockup attempts followed by a test of strength which ended in a stalemate before Triple H took advantage & Hogan reversing the momentum.  The match went to the outside with Triple H going into the guardrail & suplexed while Hogan going into the steel steps before the match went back into the ring with Hogan's leg targeted with various elbows & a figure four before various people who had an interest in this match arrived to make their presence known resulting in various chairshots & one man left bleeding.  Jerry Lawler coined this as ""battle of the biceps"" which was true in some cases as both men showcased their strength throughout the contest.
Backlash 02

w/Hulk Hogan vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck - This was a dream situation for Edge as his childhood hero was Hulk Hogan to the point where he got the ticket to see him at WrestleMania VI & not only does he get the opportunity to team with him but it was also against the Tag Team Champions on the Fourth Of July holiday complete with Hogan coming out waving the American flag & his classic theme of ""Real American"" (Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"" was his regular theme during this time). They were dominate early on against both men causing Billy & Chuck to single out Edge working him over with fast tags & double teaming with even Rico getting involved building to the eventual hot tag to Hogan. This was all about Edge having his special emotional moment with his childhood hero.
""SmackDown"" July '02

Street Fight Match vs. Mr. McMahon - ""20 Years In The Making"" was the sub-title for this match as it was promoter vs. superstar here that started off with Vince slapping Hogan & eventually gaining control working over the arm using moves like a hammerlock & objects like the ringpost while also doing dirty tactics like a low blow before Hogan was able to get the advantage back with chairshots that not only busted Vince open but also someone else who got in the way of the crossfire.  Vince gave a receipt for the chairshot himself along with using whatever he could against Hogan from a monitor to a ladder at ringside before Hogan gave his own receipt for what Vince did earlier when someone made an appearance who had his history of hatred for both men.  Knowing who was involved in this match, it wasn't a wrestling classic but very entertaining with one moment to look out for was when the camera had a close-up of Vince's face rising up from the apron as he looked like the devil himself.
WrestleMania XIX
[McMahon]

vs. Shawn Michaels - ""Icon vs. Legend"" was the tagline for this match but anyone who knows the story behind the backstage politics between these two knows this match went deeper than that.  Hogan was dominate with Shawn being tossed all over the place from in & out of the ring to off the turnbuckle onto the top rope with none of Shawn's tactics having any true effect on Hogan as he kept coming using whatever he could on the outside from the ringpost to the spanish announce table.  Shawn was finally able to get some momentum busting Hogan open & kept going after Hogan to the point where the referee had to force him off but still went on the offensive with his trademark moves including a flashback to his controversial match in Montreal.  There's a lot to be said about this match based off what I mentioned earlier in regards to the backstage politics but I'm not exactly sure what to say about the in-ring action itself because Shawn was ""bumping"" his butt off to sell Hogan's offense but also doing it was in such an extreme manner that if came off as ""overselling"" that you never saw with any of Hogan's other opponents while never seeing Shawn act that way in the ring with anyone else from Mr. McMahon to Great Khali so there really isn't any other way to phrase this match past, ""it is what it is, take it or leave it.""
Summerslam 05

(Bonus Disc) vs. Tito Santana - This was from Hogan's first run back in the WWWF as a heel with ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie in his corner while Santana was one half of the tag team champions.  Hogan jumped Tito from behind whipping him hard into corners along with offense moves like the back elbow & clothesline before Tito was able to counter another whip attempt fighting back with punches attempting to work over Hogan's arm & ribs.  This was just an average match.
""MSG"" Mar. 80

(Bonus Disc) vs. Sonny Rogers & Chuck Greenly - Jimmy Valant was Hogan's manager here while also adding some of his own opinions on the commentary as well as Hogan easily overpowered both men both individually & together easily pushing them around while applying holds like a double bearhug.  Nothing past a dominate squash.

(Bonus Disc) WWE Championship Match vs. Terry Funk - Due to the constant interference by Jimmy Hart in their previous encounter, Hogan got the assistance of Junkyard Dog in his corner who chased around Jimmy & forced him to sit in a chair at ringside.  Hogan easily overpowered Funk early on easily countering & reversing his offense while also having some entertaining moments like running over Funk when crossing the ropes & the way Funk fell out of the ring that just had you just couldn't help but laugh at while Jimmy Hart had to get involved in order to give Funk an advantage while also using dirty tactics like using the wrist tape & branding iron to keep the advantage.  This was a very entertaining match.

(Bonus Disc) vs. Harley Race - Hogan was out looking for revenge against Bobby Heenan for selling the contract of Andre The Giant to Ted Dibiase, resulting in Hogan losing the WWE Championship in controversy, and that showed as he went right after Heenan only for Race to jump Hogan coming into the ring with no effect as Hogan used his taped fist to punch Race while also using whatever he could get his hands on like the ringpost & choking using the tape on his fist while continuing to brawl on the floor.  Heenan caused a distraction allowing Race to finally get some control using a piledriver & an attempt at a big splash through an announce table that unfortunately would have a long term effect on Race.  This match served it's purpose in showing a more aggressive dominate Hogan than ever after losing the championship but is more remembered for the injury Harley Race suffered via the big splash through a table that caused him to be out of action for close to a year.

(Bonus Disc) vs. Earthquake - This was Hogan's comeback match against the man who not only put him out of action for several months but also attacked his friend, Tugboat, taking him out of Hogan's corner for this match who was replaced by Big Boss Man while Dino Bravo & Jimmy Hart was in Earthquake's corner.  Hogan came in hot but attempted to slam him early which didn't work allowing Earthquake to work over Hogan's back but Hogan kept fighting to the point where he even knocked Earthquake off his feet for the first time before chaos broke loose with Boss Man & Hogan working together to not only work over Earthquake but Bravo as well.  Bravo was able to help Earthquake regain the advantage & continued to work over Hogan's back to the point where Hogan ended up ripping the referees shirt trying to escape from a bearhug & fell over when attempting another bodyslam before ""hulking up"" & slamming Earthquake not only in the ring but through a table on the outside as well.  This was your typical Hogan match against a ""giant"" where he kept trying to overcome the power & size throughout the match before finally making his comeback.

Additional content includes Hogan's infamous speech forming the New World Order at WCW Bash At The Beach 96 & his 2005 Hall Of Fame induction while the bonus disc includes an interview with ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund at the RAW Homecoming special.  DVD extras include Iron Sheik talking about his WWE title match against Hogan & Hogan discussing his life before becoming a wrestler.  In the end, the is an ultimate collection for those fans of Hulk Hogan that I highly recommend.",1162684800,8,27268,4.556281920326864
2529652,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Now I'm not the biggest Hulk Hogan fan when it comes to his matches or his ""politics"" in the wrestling world but I can't deny that it's a great set for one of the biggest (if not THE BIGGEST) icon in sports entertainment/professional wrestling today...HULK HOGAN.  Mean Gene & Jimmy Hart (who wore the old Hogan WCW jacket he had) host this DVD set while you'll hear new & old comments from Hogan regarding some of his matches along with thoughts & comments from such WWE superstars & legends like Ric Flair, Edge, Greg Gagne, Paul Orndorff, Iron Sheik, Sgt. Slaughter, Eric Bischoff, and Shawn Michaels.  This DVD will showcase some reasons why the old school fans of professional wrestling love him & some of the new school ""smart"" fans hate him.

In my opinion, this DVD set does have some faults.  WWE has edited some of Hogan's promos & commentary to say ""WWE"" whenever he was saying ""WWF"" instead of just censoring it which is stupid because everyone knows what he really said so it's silly for WWE to try to re-write small history like that.  Also this DVD should feature all of his most important matches & not some randon ones like they did with Hulk Still Rules.  I know people are complaining about the fact that some matches on here were on other DVDs but when your doing an Ultimate Anthology on anybody or anything (althletes or sports teams, musicians, actors or actresses) then you include their most famous moments or in this case...matches.  Most of these matches should have been left off the other DVD releases like the ""History Of WWE Championship"" but shouldn't be excluded from his anthology.  If you want Hogan's rare matches from such things like television or Saturday Night's Main Events then Hulk Still Rules might please you more than this.  By the way, I did get the 4 disc set from Wal-Mart with the bonus matches (your crazy if you think I want ""Hogan Knows Best"" episodes) so those will get reviewed as well.  And I'll let you know what matches were also on other DVD's for those interested.

Disc One:

vs. Andre The Giant - This was from Hogan's first run in the WWF under Vince McMahon Sr.  The match itself is pretty short as the real highlight was Hogan doing what not alot of men were able to do & make Andre bleed.  I would have preferred they put their more famous match from Shea Stadium since this is an ultimate anthology but either way, you get the message.

The Shea Stadium match is on Hulk Still Rules.

vs. AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkle - The beginnings of Hulkamania started here as the crowd was wild for Hogan & wanted him to take the title from Bockwinke & everyone thought he finally did but it slipped through his fingers again.

vs. WWF Champion Iron Sheik - Honestly, I can try to summerize this match but who hasn't already seen this match already & what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years.

(Hulk Still Rules, Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's, History Of The WWE Championship)

vs. Big John Studd - This was a rare match from MSG & people ofter forget about how good of a worker a big man like Big John Studd was but this match was nothing to really to write home about.  The match just seems out of place to me & would have been good for the bonus disc.

vs. Roddy Piper (The War To Settle The Score) - This was the match to set up the WrestleMania main event as it was just a non-stop brawl with people getting into it left & right.  I honestly love this match because I'm such a fan of Roddy Piper & the heat he could draw from a crowd.  It wasn't Hogan doing his usual stuff so it was interesting to see.

(Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's)

w/Mr T. vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff (WrestleMania I) - The night & match that put sports entertainment on the map.  Everyone does a great job making Mr. T look better than he actually was and just knew how to mix brawling & wrestling to make a good match to watch.

(WrestleMania Anthology)

Steel Cage Match: vs. King Kong Bundy (WrestleMania 2) - For those trivia buffs, this was the only REGULAR steel cage match to happen at WrestleMania.  King Kong Bundy was a monster at this time. Hogan was selling his ribs to a tee as Bundy dominated him until Hogan was able to make his comeback.

(WrestleMania Anthology & History Of WWE Championship)

vs. Paul Orndorff (The Big Event) - Mr. Wonderful was on the best best workers at that time because his stuff looked so stiff that you thought the guy was really going to get hurt.  Hogan did bring his A game to this one was Orndorff always did & put on a great back & forth match.  The only negative I can say is that I would have liked to see their cage match as well on here & could have been put in place of the Studd match but you can't win them all.

For those wondering, their cage match is shown in full of the History Of WWE Championship DVD.  Don't get the Bloodbath Steel Cage DVD because it only shows highlights on that one.

(Hulk Still Rules)

vs. Andre The Giant (WrestleMania III) - The biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. Just like the Sheik match, there's nothing I can say about this match that hasn't been said for years & who hasn't seen this already.

(Hulk Still Rules, WrestleMania Anthology, History Of The WWE Championship)

Disc Two:

vs. WWF Champion Randy Savage (WrestleMania V) - The Mega Powers Explode. Randy Savage was a real workhorse back then and Hogan knew what to do to get the crowd to react to everything he does. Awesome match with inring storytelling that you rarely see in Hogan's matches these days.

(WrestleMania Anthology & History Of The WWE Championship)

vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior (WrestleMania VI) - This was at the time the most unique WWF Title match in the companies history. The two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & WWF Title on the line. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story & this is truely a classic even down the commentary where they didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow & the fans being split right down the middle.

(Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior, WrestleMania Anthology,  History Of The WWE Championship)

vs. WWF Champion Sgt. Slaughter (WrestleMania VII) - This was the conclusion of a storyline that WWF had did to make some money off the war in Iraq by having the american hero (Hogan) case & defeat the american turncoat (Slaughter).  The match itself was good but again, nothing really special to write about except Hogan winning the title for a record (at that time) 3 times.  By the way, their an audio glitch at the end of the match but it's nothing really big.

(WrestleMania Anthology)

vs. WWF Champion Undertaker (Tuesday In Texas) - This was the rematch from their Survivor Series match (on Undertaker's DVD) which was Hogan going back & forth with Taker until the outside interfearence from Paul Bearer, Ric Flair & Jack Tunney.  This was a fun match for me to watch.

(Hulk Still Rules)

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair (Bash At The Beach '94) - Hogan's debut match in WCW and one of Hogan's best wrestling matches in his WCW reign.  He all know Ric Flair is one of the best wrestlers in the history of the sport & Hogan knows what to do to get the crowd hooked into a match.  This was a match that did live up to all the hype it had surrounding it.

(Hulk Still Rules)

The formation of the nWo (Bash At The Beach '96) - This was from the ""Hostile Takeover"" match involving Hall & Nash vs. Luger, Savage, and Sting.  They only show everything from when Hogan started walking from the entrance.  I know some people said that the whole match should have been shown but if Hogan wasn't in the match for the first 20 mins. or even mentioned during it until the end, it shouldn't be on his anthology.  This whole speech basically kicked off the biggest period in WCW and professional wrestling in the '90s...by creating the nWo.

(Hulk Still Rules & Monday Night War.  The complete match can be seen on nWo: Back In Black)

vs. WCW Champion Giant (Hog Wild) - Honestly, this match was about nothing more than continuing the nWo storyline by winning the WCW Title...however, the most memorable moment of the match was when they spraypainted the title with the nWo letters & that's not shown here.  This match was one of the flops of the DVD as they could have used this space to include another good match from his WCW career (not all of them were good...remember nWo Souled Out or the Havoc match against Warrior?).  Matches such as his cage match with Flair from Havoc '94, his Havoc '95 match with Giant, either the SuperBrawl or Bash cage match against Vader, or one of his tag matches with Dennis Rodman against either Luger & Giant or DDP & Karl Malone.

vs. Sting (Starrcade '97) - This was the biggest match in WCW history as they had it built up for over a year (which you rarely see these days).  Hogan & Sting brought their best to the table & delieved a good back & forth match.  However, the way the finished happened just absolutely horrible & it did take away from the match itself.  Great match with a crappy finish.

Disc Three:

vs. Curt Hennig (XWF) - The story behind this match was pretty funny to hear.  The match itself was really nothing special as this was one of those Hogan matches where he just does enough to get the crowd to react.  Hennig made Hogan look better than he really was in this encounter.

vs. The Rock (WrestleMania X8) - In my opinion, this was the last classic Hulk Hogan match I've seen.  Hogan brought his A game as did The Rock & the crowd was so heavily into each & every move they made...it made the match seem even better.  Words can do this match justice.

(WrestleMania Anthology)

vs. Undisputed Champion Triple H - This began Hogan's last WWE title run as Triple H played the Curt Hennig role here & made Hogan look like a million bucks in the ring.  The finish started to get a little too screwy but overall, the match was good.  I would have prefered to see his match with Kurt Angle later in the year but I can understand why they put this one on here.

w/Edge vs. Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck - The big story here was Edge winning the tag team titles with his childhood hero Hulk Hogan.  Edge & Hogan were just clicking this match with Billy & Chuck and showed in what was a great match for SmackDown TV.

Street Fight: vs. Mr. McMahon - This match wasn't really great but it was good to just sit back & watch.  Hogan was really broken down at this point & McMahon isn't that good of a wrestler but knows how to take a beating & sell it good.  I didn't really care for it past the whole ""20 years in the making"" standpoint.

(WrestleMania Anthology & McMahon)

Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony - Basically the entire speech from his Hall Of Fame induction.  You'll hear his stories about growing up in the business & who he has to thank for his career.

(WrestleMania 21)

vs. Shawn Michaels (SummerSlam '05) - Overall, this was mostly just HBK bumping, selling, and being a ""spot monkey"" for Hogan and getting the occassional spots in before Hogan makes his eventual comeback & finish.

Bonus Disc:

vs. Tito Santana - This was from Hogan's first run in the WWF and it was a nice short match against an early Tito Santana.  Nothing special but nice to watch.

vs. Sonny Rogers & Chuck Greenly - This was one of Hogan's AWA bouts but it was nothing special as Hogan took on two jobbers in a short handicap match just to show put over how much of a monster Hogan was.

vs. Terry Funk (Saturday Night's Main Event) - I didn't know this match ever happened but I'm glad sure it was put on here.  Terry Funk & his manager Jimmy Hart knew just how to get people entertained & laughing while enjoying the wrestling at the same time.  Funk & Hogan was just an entertaining match to watch & I wish they did more with each other after watching this.

vs. Harley Race (Saturday Night's Main Event) - Another match between two legends that I forgot happened.  Just another nice match that went back & forth at times.

1990 Royal Rumble - This only shows everything after Hogan enters the Rumble match.  Typical Royal Rumble stuff that you see but the big story here was the first confrontation between Hogan & Ultimate Warrior which started the build towards their WrestleMania VI match.

(Hulk Still Rules)

vs. Earthquake (SummerSlam '90) - This was their match from the ""Get Well Hulk"" storyline which Earthquake put Hogan out of action for several months.  Basically for the '90s this was a good match but for today, it was just really slow & dull at times.  I would have prefered another match here that I either listed earlier or maybe even another Saturday Night's Main Event, SummerSlam, or even Survivor Series elimination tag match instead of this one.

RAW Homecoming Interview - This one interview will showcase why the ""smart"" wrestling fans today do not like Hulk Hogan & ended the DVD set on a bad note for me.  In this interview, Hogan touches on two things.  One is that he says if Shawn Michaels wants a rematch from SummerSlam, he's game.  However, anyone who knows the real story knows that HBK wanted a two match fued in which he gets a win & Hogan gets a win but Hogan used his politics & creative control to get one match with HBK with him winning in the end.  Hogan's other point was to plant the idea of a match with Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Now the smart fans know that Hogan has gone on record saying that if he won't lose to Austin if they have a match & Austin refuses to work the match because of Hogan's politics...but Hogan still comments that he wants to do the match & bring the idea up throughout interviews knowing Austin has refused to do the match.  I would have left this out & put on one of his return tag matches from RAW such as the 6 man with Cena & HBK vs. Jericho & Tomko & Christian, Backlash tag match with HBK vs. Hassan & Davari, or if they're just looking for a moment...put his WrestleMania 21 return when he confronted Hassan & Davari.

Overall, this anthology isn't perfect as some stuff could have been left off & put on but overall, it's great for anyone who's a true fan of Hulk Hogan throughout his entire career & heavily makes up for alot of things that were left out of Hulk Still Rules.  I recommend.",1162684800,7,14440,4.435508345978755
2529653,4,B000EQ5SL6,"For a man who transcended the sport, became a larger-then-life household name, and put pro wrestling on the map as a financially legitimate form of entertainment in the 1980s, you would have expected more from the WWE with this DVD anthology.  It's not that the release is bad.  In fact, many of Hogan's main matches are here, including his legendary Wrestlemania 3 showdown with Andre the Giant, his Wrestlemania 6 thriller with Ultimate Warrior, the formation of the NWO, and his initial WWE title victory over the evil Iron Sheik.

But what does disappoint is the lack of effort that seems to have gone into the choice of matches, and the little bio commentary by Hogan and others (Edge, Cena, Ric Flair, etc) in-between the matches is so sparse that it's just annoying.  Rather than have Hogan say a sentence or two of commentary (such as how ""strong King Kong Bundy was"") before each match (as they do here), they should have just released a full biography chapter, as it would seem less disjointed that way.  As it is now, Hogan never really says anything of consequence on this DVD.  They should have included more candid interviews with him.  One wants to hear more of his opinions on his various oponents, his thoughts about the industry and the change in marketing that occured with the ""extreme"" era in the 1990s, and so forth.

Also, they should have included a few ""rarer"" matches -- more of Hogan's AWA stint, for example, or some of his victories at Survivor Series and the Royal Rumbles.  As it is now, a VAST majority of these matches can be found on prior WWE DVD releases such as the Wrestlemania Box set or the Hogan DVD releaseed several years ago.  The only real ""gems"" of this anthology are the previously unreleased XWF match against Curt Hennig (Mr. Perfect), despite the fact that the match itself is rather lackluster, his tag team championship match with Edge, and his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech.

The match with Paul Orndorf on the DVD (called ""The Big Event"") is very good, but it doesn't compare to the steel cage thriller the two had on Saturday Night's Main Event (which was, for some reason, not included on this set).

This will satisfy casual fans who don't generally buy many WWE DVDs. But to those who already have Hogan's older, single DVD release, as well as the Wrestlemania DVDs, there's nothing on this DVD that makes it worth purchasing.",1162512000,5,2388,4.686602870813397
2529654,4,B000EQ5SL6,"I recently picked up the DVD and it was worth the purchase but there was far more that could have been done with it.  The main event from the 1987 Survivor Series with Team Hogan vs Team Andre, I know it was a losing effort but it was what launched Survivor Series.  His victory at the '91 Royal Rumble, the victory at the '90 Rumble was on the Hulk Still Rules disk.  His victory at the 95 War Games with Sting, Luger, and Randy Savage.  His Showdown with Kevin Nash that saw the return of the red and yellow in WCW.

More of his AWA matches and his matches as the man in the NWO, his interview on Life Styles of the Rich and Famous with Robin Leech. I mention this one to demonstrate the cross-over appeal that Hogan had in 1989 to show that the Rock, Goldberg, Austin, and Triple H weren't the pioneers of going from Wrestling to the world of Hollywood.  The main event of the 1st SummerSlam the Mega Powers vs the Mega Bucks.  The '91 Summerslam with Hogan teaming with Ultimate Warrior vs the Triangle of Terror ( Sgt. Slaughter, Gen. Adnan aka Shiek Adnan El Kasae, Col. Mustafa aka the Iron Shiek).

I know the Warrior fell from grace that night but the match was a good one.  The XWF footage was a nice addition to the DVD set and his matches with Terry Funk and Harley Race were good too.  The combination of this set and Hulk Still Rules are as close we are going to get to a true anthology.  The man has been all over the world in a career spanning 3 decades, you'd have to do a WrestleMania type Anthology set to do his career justice and that is like 20 plus disks.",1161648000,4,1578,4.1749174917491745
2529655,2,B000EQ5SL6,"There are so many flaws I don't know where to start. First I'd like to say that I own every WWE DVD that has been put out in the last 5 years so I'm being honest on every critiscism. First off why do we need the same matches on each dvd set that comes out. I'd rather see a match that was from a house show that might have been unique and never seen rather than the same old s*it. Hogan vs. Warrior WM 6, Match that I love, however do I need it on Warrior's DVD the WM 6 DVD, Hulk Still Rules, Ultimate Anthology and History of the WWE Championship. It's ridiculous. Then not to mention the Voodoo Child song not played. If you can't put these songs on DVD's then don't bother playing them when the events are on TV and PPV. Also we are so sick of the blurring of the logo already, you guys make enough money suck it up and pay the WWF and move on. The real kicker of this set is how WWE shopzone handled the sale of it. They advertised the 4th disc of the bonus matches so I ordered it from them just for that reason. I get it and they give me some bogus Hogan knows best recap. I then looked at the description on the day I received the set and how convenient they changed the description. Then there is the audio problem that occurs at the end of the Hogan vs. Slaughter WM 7 match, as he gets the 123 the audio goes blank. As far as content goes there are a few matches that are good to see on there from AWA a couple from WCW and the XWF match. But overall they slant the whole story about Hogan. They are not honest about his career when it came to WCW. Why couldn't they show the bash at the beach 2000 and comment on the screw job he dealt with. No all we get is he left WCW in 2000. I can't stand when WWE pretends that people haven't been watching wrestling for years and that we forget how history occured. They just think they can slap some matches on a few discs and show you want they want you to see and that somehow we will forget what really happened. I love how they show the terrible Starrcade 97 match with Sting which was built up for 15 months and sucked and had a finish that made no sense.  Stop showing us 90 percent WWE matches and start showing more WCW matches. For some reason WWE has to dominate when it comes to what is shown on these DVD's they for some reason barely want to show us WCW when in a lot of instinces some WCW matches were better. Overall the set is decent at best and if you buy it get it at Walmart where they don't fals advertise.",1161475200,10,2479,3.997983870967742
2529656,5,B000EQ5SL6,"This dvd is great and more matches on it more than hulk still rules dvd ,now some people are complaning about some things,um i don't know why ye sthe hulk first dvd was great don't get me wrong but it missed a lot.hogan became hollywood in wcw and that dvd only had one wcw match?werid huh at least this dvd has more wcw fights on it and more wwe fights like the warrior fight from wm 6 and macho man from wm 5 and plus from more currnet like thiple h and hbk fight on thier. well naywaz hulk is a god of wresling and this is a must owen  i been a wresling fan for years this dvd is a must get.",1161388800,,594,3.8292682926829267
2529657,3,B000EQ5SL6,"The absolute gems in this DVD are the Hogan VS Bockwinkle match and the Hogan VS Andre match from 1980 (which I was expecting to be the match from Shea but its not, which is awsome) the Hogan VS Studd match from the Garden in 1984 and the NWO matches later in the set. The typical anoyances are here with the addition of Real American to the AWA championship match dubbed over whatever was playing. Most Hulkamaniacs know that Real American wasn't used until later years. Plus they got rid of any music by Jimi Hendrix (including NWO's theme), just pay the royalties McMahon! At least Jesse Ventura's Commentary is here. Other than that the majority of the matches are already on other DVD's that WWE has released. The Hulk Still Rules DVD has much more variety and is not so heavy on Hulk's major matches, although most are there. If you buy this set and Hulk Still Rules DVD then you would have THEE ULTIMATE ANTHOLOGY!",1161388800,4,921,4.520958083832335
2529658,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Even though I am a longtime ""Hulkamaniac"", I was a little skeptical of this set.  The WWE had released ""Hulk Still Rules"" a few years ago and I wasn't sure how different this one could be.  I know Hogan has plenty of matches to chose from but I also know that the WWE has a habit of showcasing ceratin wrestlers more than others so I was fearful of a lot of rehash.

That is NOT the case here.  They've done a nice job of mixing bouts from a lot of different eras and showing us matches many have never seen before.  True, they didn't have one long documentary on Hogan's career but the little blurbs Mean Gene Okerlund and Jimmy Hart share more than suffice.

As some people have noticed, there are actually THREE different versions of this DVD set being released.  One is the basic 3 disc set while the other 2 consist of 4 discs.  One of the 4 disc sets contains Hogan Knows Best shows and the other contains 6 more matches and an interview.

The last version is the one selling at Walmrt for a mere $19.99 and the one I'd reccommend.  Just a warning, the 1990 Royal Rumble match isn't the entire match, it comes in when Hogan enters the fray.  Still, if you've never seen that match (or haven't in a while), it's very entertaining.  The Hogan vs. Earthquake match is one that is very underrated and both Saturday Night's Main Event matches (vs. Terry Funk and vs. Harley Race) are a lot of fun to watch.  Harley Race does a splash through a table which has been rumored to have cut short his career.

Bottom-line is that whichever version you get, there's a lot of good stuff on these sets and unless you're a Hogan hater, should be worth a buy.",1161216000,3,1649,4.311688311688312
2529659,5,B000EQ5SL6,"To make a long story short, this anthology is a must have for fans of Hulk Hogan and 80's wrestling in general. Many of his pre-WWE stints, AWA stints, WCW and WWE stints are here. Only thing is...you want to be careful to buy the Wal-Mart version of the collection because it features a bonus matches dvd as opposed to Hogan Knows Best.",1161129600,8,337,4.365079365079365
2529660,1,B000EQ5SL6,"Hogan was a ego maniac. He held talent down and gave jobs to people that weren't even great wrestlers. This dvd is nothing new in the Hogan cannon. They released a dvd set of Hogan matches that had better matches on the other dvd, Hulk Still Rules. The WCW matches that are new- facing Giant and Sting, are a complete waste of dvd transfer. I bought this set because there was an extra disc with a all new matches and he was a good showman and he could wrestle a good match on occasion. The problem I have with Hogan was reading about him in the Death of WCW. Now you can call me bias, but I do believe they were right about Hogan. He is ego maniac and won't job to wrestles younger then him and don't put over anyone younger either.",1161043200,5,733,4.1328671328671325

However, I would also recommend you pick up the 2Disc ""Hulk Still Rules"" set also. It has a 60 minute documentary feature that is not on the new 4 disc set. It also has several matches that are not on the new set. These include:

1. Hogan's debut WWWF match against (a non-Million Dollar Man) Ted DiBiase at MSG on 12/17/79.

2. Bob Backlund vs. the Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika), 12/83: Hogan's WWF return from the AWA as he helps Mr. Backlund. Post-match promo from both afterward.

3. Hogan and Brutus ""the Barber"" Beefcake w/Elizabeth vs. Zeus and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Summer Slam '89. Another classic!!

4. Hogan vs. 2 jobbers, All-Star Wrestling match, 1/2/80: Token jobber squash match.

5. Hogan and ""Mean Gene"" Okerlund vs. George ""the Animal"" Steele and Mr. Fuji. Fun match

6. Hogan vs. Big John Studd from Puerto Rico in the rain.

7. Hogan vs. Nikolai Volkoff from Saturday Night's Main Event, 10/5/85.

8. Hogan vs. Mr. Perfect (w/ The Genius) from SNME, 4/28/90

9. Hogan and Andre vs. Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy from SNME: Classic WWF style big man collision

10. Hogan vs. Piper, WrestleVision, 11/7/85: Another classic feud.

11. Survivor Series '88. Team Mega-Powers (Hogan, Savage, Hercules, Hillbilly Jim and Koko B. Ware) vs. Team Mega-Bucks (DiBiase, Bossman, Akeem, Haku, Red Rooster). Great Survivor Series action!!

Also, there is many promos and skits and interview that are NOT on the new set! I repeat...NOT on the new set..

The only way to have the True Anthology is if you own both sets...(Also remember that the Hulk Still Rules set doesn't have the WWF logo blurring and editing that this new set has!)..

The new set is a must have(if you get the wal-mart bonus dvd), but so is the old set.

The box is heavy cardboard and opens up with 4 plastic slims to hold each dvd..HOWEVER, be carefull when turning them, they break easy!!!",1161043200,7,2047,4.616022099447513
2529662,3,B000EQ5SL6,"The WWE has done something really stupid with this release.

Here on Amazon, they're selling a 3 disc set, on WWE's web site, they're selling a 4 disc version

that has episodes of Hogan Knows Best on the 4th disc and exclusively at Wal-Mart (where I bought mine)

they're selling a 4 disc set that contains a bonus disc of matches - THIS version of the DVD is the one to own,

and most fans agree with me, just check the sales ranking for this DVD on Amazon. It's not selling nearly as

well here as it should. All these different versions was a HUGE mistake. This is why I've given this set only 3

stars. The WWE should have stuck to releasing only the 4 disc version that contains the bonus disc of matches.

So, if you want as many matches as possible, buy your copy at Wal-Mart.

Now, on to the review....

This set is hosted by Mean Gene and Jimmy Hart (who infortunately stays in character) and includes interviews

and comments by various promoters, friends, wrestlers and Hogan himself to tell his story. Most of the

matches here are from the original WWE Hulk Still Rules DVD set, but with some unique additions.

You'll see a short angle between Hogan and Andre from a 1980 episode of WWWF television where Hogan

busts Andre open. Also new to this set is Hogan vs Nick Bockwinkel from the AWA, Hogan vs Big John Studd from MSG, Hogan vs the Giant from WCW Hog Wild, Hogan vs Sting from Starrcade, Hogan vs Curt Henning from XWF (the most unexpected match on this set), Hogan vs Triple H for the Undisputed Title, Hogan and Edge vs Billy and Chuck for the WWE Tag Titles, Hogan vs McMahon from WM and Hogan vs Shawn Michaels from SS. Everything else has been seen on the previous release. One match that's included I have to question why WWE chose it, and that's Hogan vs Sgt. Slaughter from WM. This is not only one of Hogan's worst matches, but it was hands down the WORST WM main event ever. Both men showed so much light in this match it's ridiculous. It is worth watching however, just to see the most obvious blade job ever. You'll clearly

see Hogan remove the blade, cut himself, lay the blade on the mat just to have the ref bend over and pick it up and place it in his pocket - too funny!

On the plus side, the Nick Bockwinkel match is classic and so is the encounter between Hogan and Piper. The match from the ""Big Event"" between Paul Orndorff is also a classic, so there's a lot of classic moments here. Also, if you were worried about it, Jesse Ventura's audio commentary has NOT been cut out, it's all here.

If you get the 4 disc set at Wal-Mart, you'll get to see the following: Hogan vs Tito Santana (1980), Hogan vs Rogers and Greenly from the AWA, Hogan vs Terry Funk from Saturday Night's Main Event, Hogan vs Harley Race from Saturday Night's Main Event, 1990 Royal Rumble match (from the moment Hogen enters), Hogan vs Earthquake from SS 1990 and an interview with Mean Gene from 2005.

The cool thing about this is the footage from Saturday Night's Main Event. They included tons of pre and post match footage from SNME. For example, for the Terry Funk match, you'll see Jesse Ventura interview Terry Funk poolside before the match, a news segment about Funk attacking Hogan, Mean Gene interview with Hogen and the Junkyard Dog plus all the post match happenings - really cool. After watching this, it makes me wish that the WWE would release SNME on a season by season basis on DVD, but it will never happen...I guess.

Overall, if you bought the ""Hulk Still Rules"" set, this is worth picking up if to only get the 4th bonus disc of matches, but don't expect too much new content beyond that. Why WWE released 3 versions of this is beyond me, just be sure you know which version you're getting before buying!",1161043200,22,3747,4.405797101449275
2529663,5,B000EQ5SL6,I pre-ordered the 4 disc set through WWE Shop expecting to get a 4th bonus disc of additional matches.  I was browsing the site and discovered they changed the content of the 4th bonus disc to a Hogan Knows Best Bonus disc. It contains two episodes of the show plus a sneak peek into the upcoming season.  I emailed them asking what exactly the bonus disc contained and i was told that it was the Hogan Knows Best.  The reports of the bonus disc containing additional matches was an error. If you pre-ordered the 4 disc edition expecting the additional matches you will be dissapointed.,1159833600,5,586,4.561904761904762

2529665,5,B000EQ5SL6,"I am giving this 5 stars because I can't deny that Hulk Hogan is a legend. Along with Ric Flair, he is one of the two greatest legends of all time most likely.

However, Hulk Hogan did not put wrestling on the map and he did not make wrestling what it is today.  All of you young fans are pretty willing to believe anything Vince McMahon shells out to you.  Vince McMahon made wrestling what it is today and Hogan was there to help out.  We'll never know what wrestling would have been like if Vince chose someone else to be his champion, but it's wrong of all you people to give Hogan all the credit.  Hogan may have helped to bring people in, but people wouldn't have cared about Hogan at all if it weren't for Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, King Kong Bundy and of course the real draw at the time was Andre the Giant.

It was a collection of people that put wrestling on the map.  If Hogan was there alone, beating up people with no charisma who we didn't care about, no one would have noticed.  give the credit where it's due.  McMahon, Hogan, Piper and all the good guys and villians of the 80's helped propell wrestling into the mainstream.  Hogan did NOT do it alone.",1158796800,,1171,4.257918552036199

All of today's wrestlers owe the Hulkster for making Wrestling what is today.  The money they make is in large part thanks to him.  Don't misunderstand me - Vince McMahaon is equally deserving but Hulk Hogan is the guy that put wrestling on top with Vince's direction.  He is the Superman of wrestling - instead of truth, justice and the American way it's training , praying and taking your vitamins.

Now I only wish they would released dvds on Snuuka, and Steamboat.  I'm sure a lot of fans would agree that back in the 80s both of them were just as popular as Hogan.  But this isn't a debate on who was popular and not I do hope they include some of his matches with Sting and Goldberg on these dvds.  Also his match with Ric Flair at Bash at the beach which was his debut match for WCW.  It is a shame though that they don't wait a few more months and get the match he is going to have with Orton.

So let's stop with the bashing. And Warrior being better than Hogan? Sorry, but you've got to be out of your mind. Warrior was a great hit for about five minutes. He no-showed events and botched many a match. He wasn't nearly as great an interview as Hogan, and he turned his back on his fans plenty of times. Oh, and the greatest match of Warrior's career?

My question is this: Where are all the great Saturday Night's Main Event matches?  How about some good MSG house show matches as well?

Hogan had some really good fueds in the 80s that didn't get a lot of television exposure.  Matches against Greg Valentine, Ted DiBiase, Rick Rude, Big Bossman, Killer Khan, ""King"" Harley Race and others made good money at house shows and have appeared in the old VHS format on Coliseum Video's old ""Hulkamania"" series (for those of us old enough and lucky enough to own some of those!)

As far as the PPV matches go, hopefully the WWE will release SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series sets similar to the WrestleMania set.  If so, why bother putting them on this set too?",1147219200,4,981,4.662790697674419

WWE, 21/8/05: Hulk Hogan vs. Shawn Michaels (SummerSlam 2005)

The format will apparently mirror that of the Undertakers Tombstone set. Honestly, I really don't think the match selection could be any better. The only thing I might add would be another match or two from the WCW Era, specifically the one of the heel Hollywood world title wins (either over the Giant at Hog Wild or over Luger at Road Wild) and the match against Goldberg on Nitro. Also might have thrown in one of his celebrity matches with Rodman for the sheer camp value. Overall though, no complaints.",1147132800,6,3025,5.3276955602537
2529678,1,B000EQ5SL6,"As far as this DVD goes, hopefully they'll have matches from AWA, WWE, and WCW...and possibly rare matches. As far as Hogan goes, he is nothing but a sports entertainer NOT a wrestler. I'll never forget it once Gorilla Monsoon mentioned that Hogan doesn't know a wrist lock from a wrist watch. I'll give the devil his dues, he put asses on seats and he is still loved and respected by many. I've always liked Hogan as an entertainer but never as a wrestler. The whole thing with Hogan and Hart is the fact that Hogan has ducked Bret Hart from way back around wrestlemania 9. At the King of the Ring that year was suppose to be Bret Hart vs Hogan for the title with Hart coming on top, but Hogan's politics did not let that happen. Back in WCW why do think they had Hart join the NWO with Hogan? Its because Hogan did not want to put Bret Hart over. Why do you think Austin doesn't want to wrestle Hogan? Its because Austin realizes what kind of politics Hogan plays. Anyways with all that said, I hope this DVD will be alot better than Hulk Still Rules.",1145836800,,1053,4.27
2529679,1,B000EQ5SL6,"I have been a fan of wrestling since i was really young, around 3 or 4 and i grew up watching Hulk Hogan. I used to think he was great and untouchable.... until i read ""The Death of WCW"". You would never believe that one man could destroy a multi-million dollar company, but sure enough Hulk Hogan managed to accomplish this.  First of all, yes, Hogan was popular during wrestling boom stage, but if he really cared about the kids/fans then why did he leave for ""Hollywood"". Cause the fans realized how lame the guy was. So he tucked tail and left, only to reappear at Wrestlemania 9 and demand to win the WWF Championship, then leave after he lost at the King of The Ring. He didn't care about anyone but himself and the money he was making and going to make with his ""blockbuster"" films.  Then he goes to WCW and well you just have to read the book to see the many underhanded tatics he used. I watched his first dvd and he even says in it that he knew how to work everyone and knew how to play backstage politics. Hogan never put over anyone but Goldberg (i don't care about warrior)and billy kidman?!?! What Billy kidman? GET REAL! And of course we go to Summerslam 2005 Hogan vs Michaels, in a match that Michaels should have dominated, he didn't cause Hogan needed that win and then later go out publicly and cry about the payoff he got from the WWE. Hogan is all about backstage politics and could careless about anyone but himself and i may not agree with bret hart on a lot of things, but i am glad he snubbed him at the Hall of Fame Ceremony. One last thing Stone Cold (and maybe Rock) was the only man to ever carry the WWE, they were all but down and out and Steve Austin came along and well the rest is History.  Hulk Hogan is no way a Legend in my eyes.",1145750400,,1767,4.206489675516224
2529680,2,B000EQ5SL6,"I will have to agree with the last reviewer, Hulk is and never will b known as a great wrestler...In my eyes he flat out stunk but he did have tons of charisma and quit frankly i don't think anybody else but him would have been able to propel wrestling to the heights he did...thats the only credit he gets..there were tons of guys back in the days that would put on better matches but with less hype of course...so to say Hogan was the best, well then ur smokin some superduper high grade ish!!!Bottom line..if u cant get enough of mid 80's  to early 90's wrestling then get it, even if its all hogan matches..lmao....weeeeeeeee",1145318400,,629,4.422413793103448
2529681,1,B000EQ5SL6,"Congratulations Mr. A. Flanagan, you have probably written the most ridicules review in history. Reading your review I realised you know nothing of the wrestling business and even less about Hulk Hogan. First you say that wrestling's fake, so you don't really need any ability in the ring. Yes wrestling is fake, but pro wrestling only really get interesting when the wrestler are able to pull the crowd and the viewing public right into the match, and make them believe that it is real, and make them apart of the match, and make them believe that it is life or death out there, that when pro wrestling really grabs fans and for that you need wrestling ability.

A good example of this is Bret Hart vs. Stone Cold at WM13. To do this there must be a good story, played out by wrestler with great ability, who can sell each other moves (something Hogan knows nothing about), and draw the crowd into the match. You're telling me that character is the only thing a wrestler needs, so you're really telling me that the Boogeyman is a better wrestler then Rey Mysterio, if you are you're an idiot.

You state that Stone Cold has no wrestling ability, and he got over with just his character. His character did play a big part in him getting over, but he has real wrestling ability. Before his neck injury in 1997, he was a great wrestler, just watch some of his early WCW matches in the Hollywood Blondes or against Brian Pillman, or my personal favourite against Ricky Steamboat. He had great wrestling ability, then after the neck injury he had to change his wrestling style, but he still had great psychology and was still able to put together a great match.

If your comment about Steve Austin, where not bad enough, you really make a fool out of yourself when you state that The Rock left his fans and went to Hollywood, while Hogan's always been there for the industry. This show you know nothing about Hulk Hogan, first Hogan never wanted to be a wrestler, he just wanted to be famous, and he tried music and movies before he accidentally fell into wrestling. After Vince McMahon turned him into a star by giving him a TV gimmick from the incredible Hulk, he turned his back on the industry that made him, took all the money he made and went to Hollywood, just like The Rock. There he made some of the worst movies ever made, do you remember Suburban Commando or Mr. Nanny, if you don't, don't worry Amazon do stock copies of both classics.

After his film career bombed he came crawling back to wrestling, but by now the industry had changed and nobody cared about Hogan, and after the stunt he pulled at Wrestle Mania 9, Vince McMahon was sick of him. Hogan was just like The Rock, only there are two differences, first the Rock has had a box office hit (Scorpion King) and two, unlike Hogan, The Rock gave back to the industry. There is no wrestler who reached that level of fame that he has and put over more wrestlers then the Rock. He put over Triple H, Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle to mention a few. Hogan only ever put over two wrestlers, the Ultimate Warrior and Goldberg, even then on both occasions he came back to reclaim his crown.

People always say that he put people over when he came back to the WWE, but the truth is he had no option, he did not have creative control over his character, and Vince McMahon was ready to make him pay for testifying against him in court and trying to put him out of business with WCW. So Vince Made him job to everyone, and nobody deserved it more than Hogan. Hulk Hogan has never cared about this industry, all he cared about was himself and how much money he can make. He held back talent at the WWE in the 80's, held back talent in WCW in the 90's and he single handily destroyed WCW, quite an accomplishment for one man.

So Mr. A. Flanagan, brother, let me give you advice brother, don't believe the lies that come out of Hulk Hogan's mouth brother, Hogan is a retard, brother, and that's the bottom line brother.",1143849600,6,3994,4.442019099590723
2529682,5,B000EQ5SL6,"Hulk Hogan is one of the best wrestlers, yes this is true, but the wrestlers of today will be the hulks and rics of tomorrow.  Not to mention that ric flair is also one of the best wrestlers in the world.  One of the reviews urged people to read hulk hogans book.  I urge people to read ric flair's book and see hulk hogan through someone else's eyes.  He isn't the humblest guy in the world...",1143849600,,394,4.144736842105263

He was born in 1959 in Augusta, Ga.  I bought this DVD and saw my schoolmate being inducted in the Hall of Fame!!!  He was in the 8th. grade in 1973.
