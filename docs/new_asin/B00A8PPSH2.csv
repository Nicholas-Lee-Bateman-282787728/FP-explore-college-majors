8548406,2,B00A8PPSH2,"The reason I watched this was because it had Stacy Keach in it, how he  even got involved in this one is beyond me.
He plays a nut who starts to control weather from his cell phone, yep I said it, his cell phone!
He was fired so,in revenge he starts killing people with different kinds of weather, including red rain, he is also estranged from his two sons.
He  also destroys many Washington DC landmarks during the duration of the film, via CGI.
The reason I gave it two stars is because it has a few decent actors in it, Stacy Keach and Jason London.
Turned out to be many one of the many subpar disaster films out there, Twister it is not!
This believe it or not, is not an Asylum film.",1362960000,3,689,4.134328358208955
