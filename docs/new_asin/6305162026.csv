991687,3,6305162026,"If you do any type of collecting, you know that you eventually run across hidden gems in bargain places. Such was it for me w/this DVD. Look in just about any retail movie outlet under DVDs under 10.00 & you're bound to  find this movie! What a buy! This was Michael (Beetleguises) first real  dramatic role. Unlike a lot of comedic actors before him ( Bill Murray's  Razor's Edge springs to mind), Keaton brings home a powerful performance of  a chronic substance abuser in rehab for all the wrong reasons. What he  comes away with, and what the audience comes away with, is a tightly woven  film, full of interesting characters and fine performances, lead, of  course, by Michael Keaton. Although some will argue that he's had his share  of dramatic roles since, they've all been either contrived (My Life),  cartoonish (Batman), or psychos (Pacific Heights & Extreme Measures).  What Keaton needs is more fine roles like he enjoyed in this film to make  the leap from comedic actor to dramatic actor (ala Tom Hanks). I just hope  that he can at least keep his incredible comedic edge!",963619200,2,1087,4.723404255319149
991688,3,6305162026,"This was an entertaining movie with some strong performances.  However, something about it is lacking an air of realism.  I've attended many AA and NA meetings myself, and the portrayal here is somewhat cliched and not  completely accurate.  I've also been through several treatments, and the  portrayal here is also ""off"" somehow.  Modern treatment centers  don't really operate in the way things are portrayed here.  If you want to  know what most AA meetings are really like, find an ""open""  meeting in your area and attend it.  However, this movie was entertaining  and the performances are good.  It was a bit over-long, and there was too  much focus on the romance between Keaton and Baker.  More realism, less  sentimentality and a little more cutting-room time, and this movie could  have been better.  But I enjoyed it.
Note - The DVD version is offered  only in pan-and-scan, and there are literally no features on the disc.",947980800,21,934,4.909677419354839
991689,4,6305162026,"This still is Micheal Keaton's best film.  Oddly, it was his first dramatic film.  Most people today know Keaton as someone who does dramatic films, not remembering he always did comedies and standup.  He did Mr. Mom,  Beetlejuice, the Dream Team, Night Shift, etc.  Taken in light of this,  Clean and Sober is a very depressing film, and one of the better films to  handle the often overly-used storyline on drug addiction.  I was stunned at  Keaton's acting ability in this film.  You genuinely hated him, but  throughout the film, you learn to accept him and give him the thumbs up as  he tries to build his life back together.  Not a family flick, nor a  rousing ""I'm glad I'm alive"" film.  It's a dark and realistic  film.  And, hey, it's got Morgan Freeman in a stellar supporting role, too.  Keaton's best film to date.
The DVD doesn't have anything else on it,  but frankly, here's one instance where I just wouldn't want anything extra.  It would have been nice to have Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, but I can live  with it.  It's not an action film, after all.",947980800,8,1065,4.523809523809524
991690,5,6305162026,"I have seen this video twice and now I am going to buy it.  It shows just how far a person will go to satisfy their drug habit. Also shows far far they will go to keep from getting caught.  Some addicts don't believe they  have a  drug problem, but they can see others problems. Detox is no picnic,  losing a friend  isn't either, but admitting that your are an addict takes  even more courage. I recommend this movie to anybody that has a friend or  family member who is an addict to drugs or alcohol.",940377600,5,502,4.15625
991691,5,6305162026,Micheal Keaton character in this film shows the truth when someone is in denial of their problems and are afraid to face the truth.

991858,2,6305162026,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Was so surprised this was filmed in Darby, PA. I know you are thinking why would they do that, not exactly Beverly Hills let alone Compton. I think it is theee only time I have even heard a reference to this town and have not been there in decades. Well so much for all the excitement in this production.

Have known addicts most of my life and it appears the reviews praise such an accurate portrayal. I found the dialogue plodding and too many gratuitous scenes of Keaton being a jerk, we get it, he's an A$$hole. And then he spends only 30days in rehab and is completely ready for a LIVE-IN relationship, yeah right, am sure his sponser is impressed. He shows no improvement in his dealings with anyone else, hence huge plot hole here.

Suggest you watch Ray Milland in ""Lost Weekend"", now that's an addict my friends and what a wild ride he took us on! ""Clean and Sober"" is just window dressing compared to Milland's portrayal. I was extremely bored with the incessant panning to dumbstruck facial expressions and lack of realistic conversations. This is a difficult topic to address, I appreciate that, but to downplay the process, even despite two deaths, was an insult to all struggling addicts in recovery.

I have enjoyed many Keaton projects and this is definitely a departure from Batman or BeetleJuice, so be prepared for a letdown. I cannot recommend this film for any purpose other than a shallow introspection of an addict in denial. Oh, and EVERYBODY smokes non- stop, extremely annoying, cough!",1494892800,,1553,4.719557195571956

991948,3,6305162026,"Strong performance here by Michael Keaton in this movie just shows the range from which he can act and act so good.  From Beetlejuice to Batman to Mr Mom in this movie Keaton took on a drug addicted alcoholic role and made it so believable. He is an executive businessman who has bilked the company of thousands to support his drug habits who wakes up one day with a corpse in his bed from a rough night of partying and finds his world crashing around him. From there we find him in rehab with nice supporting help from Morgan Freeman and Kathy Bates who shines in any role she is given. As Keaton struggles we literally take the journey with him from addiction to sobriety.

I saw this movie so long ago but it was nice to revisit the performances and the drama that still holds this movie up.",1474675200,,794,4.322147651006712

992156,5,6305162026,Apart from Birdman (which Keaton should have won and deserved the Oscar ) this is Mikes best performance to a truly brilliant beautiful underrated film and the best film ever made on addiction. I can relate to this film in a lot of ways. I think more films however should be made about addiction too prescription meds like benzodiapines and the years it takes people to wean off that particular medication. But this film was ahead of its time and yes addiction ruins people's lives. I don't believe in the aa way of doing things however and when it comes to alcohol even though I'm an alcoholic I'll still drink on ocassion. This film should be shown in every rehab facility along with 28 days and days of wine and roses. Beware this is not a feel good film even though in typical Keaton fashion you can't help but laugh because he's a wonderfully funny actor. All in all for any Keaton fan for any addict  to substances to anyone who appreciates film as an art should see this. Just a heads up however when it comes to benzodiapines do not go to rehab for that because it takes years or possibly never to recover from withdrawal. Try to find a benzodiapines wise practioner who actually cares about u as a person to responsibly wean u off or get a copy of The Ashton manual but please don't blindly trust MDS DOS etc...because withdrawal from benzodiapines can kill you just as much as an overdose if not worse.,1458518400,3,1412,4.4728682170542635

992360,5,6305162026,"Michael Keaton is very believable as Daryl, an alcoholic cocaine addict.
Morgan Freeman is also believable as Craig, a recovering addict who is now a counselor running a rehab center.
This movie is very deep and touching.

Contains spoilers..

Daryl doesn't ""hit rock bottom.""
He is in trouble with the police and needs a place to hide.
He hears a commercial about a rehab center that offers anonymity and a safe place with complete confidentiality,
in other words, a place to stay where no one will know where he is.
So, he checks himself in, the whole time believing that he doesn't need to be there, even when he suffers through detox.

By the end of the rehab program, Daryl has failed several times, but he starts to realize that he does have a problem.
He gets a sponsor, not on purpose, but because he was calling his drug dealer and dialed the wrong number.

This is NOT a ""fun"" movie to watch; it has Keaton playing a man desperate to AVOID reality by continuing to use and to deny his addiction.

- It made recovery look pretty easy.  The viewer didn't get to see Keaton's bottom, or any real struggle with his addiction.
- He did just what his sponsor told him.  His 4th and 5th steps felt like a sham (to me)
- Clapping after a lead irritated me.  That's not how we do things.
- I was afraid that the movie would de-volve into a romance and relieved when it became a great illustration of the actions of a dry drunk - trying to save others rather than focusing on saving himself.

That said, I felt like the acting was top notch, and the writer handled the subject with as much honesty as would be prudent in a movie that he also wanted to be profitable.

28 Days was also recommended.  I watched that movie as a practicing drunk and, not surprisingly, hardly remember it.  I look forward to watching with a clearer understanding of its message.",1389139200,3,1015,4.437837837837838

992875,5,6305162026,"And I got this thing for Michael Keaton and I also have a thing for self destructive characters so maybe this review might be a little impartial.

This is one of Michael Keaton's finest films. There are a litany of films about drug addiction and substance abuse and although most of them can be depressing this one left me quite invigorated and refreshed. Without exaggerating, I felt reborn again.

Daryl Poynter (Michael Keaton) is a Philadelphia real estate salesman who is on a path to self destruction. His driven but self absorbed personality exposes what lies beneath, which is an acute addiction to cocaine. That is the least of his worries when he wakes up next to a dead woman who apparently over dosed on cocaine and suffered a major heart attack the night before. Daryl has been subsidizing his addiction by embezzling money from an escrow account. He also used these funds to play the stock market which doesn't quite pan out the way he planned. In short, he burns through almost $92,000. Now, the police are involved and make it clear that they know Daryl is responsible for the woman's heart attack.

As a result, he checks himself into a drug rehabilitation program to lay low and remain completely anonymous. This is where he meets a tough counselor, Craig (Morgan Freedman). He also meets and falls in love with another fellow patient in the program who goes by the name of Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker).

The acting all around is superb. Michael Keaton is captivating and convincing as a salesman completely on the brink of collapse. We observe how ignorant he is of his apparent drug addiction. His immediate problems are only the result of a larger and deeper problem, denial and self absorption. It's very easy to identify with Daryl and like him too because there is something inherently good and wholesome about him. His deep emotional struggles are brought to surface through his counselor Craig and his sponsor Richard Dirks (Michael Emmet Walsh) He is rehabilitated and he is lured into temptation but it is the chip that leaves the viewer hopeful, invigorated, and emotionally touched. Despite Daryl's behavior, one cannot help but to route for him during the film's entirety.

And so I got this chip, and this chip belongs to Michael Keaton for making a believable film about the perils and consequences of a drug addiction.",1368230400,,2354,4.845771144278607

993039,3,6305162026,"CLEAN AND SOBER, starring MICHAEL KEATON (MK), MORGAN FREEMAN, KATHY BAKER, is a movie that will potentially raise as many questions as the answers that is gives out, considering that it touches upon the subjects of narcotics addiction, alcoholism, and the disorder and chaos that is felt in many people's personal lives.

Not knowing MK personally, the work suggests an almost invisible line between the character that is played by MK in the film, and MK himself, as an actor, such is the realistic feel  of the flow of events.

The story starts out with MK snorting cocaine with the daughter of a client, from whom he
embezzles $92,000 to speculate on the stock market with high risk derivatives and options, albeit only being a realtor or real estate agent. This puts his job in jeopardy at his employer, obviously, and the substance abuse is coupled with alcoholism, temper tantrums,
deafness in aspects of social skills with those surrounding him, the loss of control over
his over destiny and the annhiliation of his own reputation, that is actually crucial
for any salesperson to survive in a highly competitive field, where trust is paramount
with the clients, before any deal can close successfully.

The value of this work, is not the cinematography (merely TV box-sized release), as the colors seem to lack luster, or  the  bland and unimaginative music.  Rather, the uniqueness of the film, is the attempt to educate the viewer in how a de-tox program unfolds.

The program begins with a  48 hour cold turkey cessation of substances, often in bed. The withdrawal symptoms (vomiting, cold sweats) disappear between 2 to 5 days later, at which point the coordinator (played by Morgan Freeman) urges participants to exert an intense athletics and exercise program (pushups, etc) so as to help the mind focus on the desired end and tasks at hand.

The next phase, is a sequence of town hall meetings, to naturally satisfy the natural impulse of participants to discuss their lives, what led up to their addiction in drugs and alcohol,
and to hear others do the same, taking and learning while they go along.

Next, a so-called ""Family Room"" is occupied, apparently signaling that a  psychological
intimacy has been achieved, and a total honesty among all heretofore, with a continuation of physical activity, exercise which turns into ""probations"" under which, the individuals
are allowed to communicate with the outside world for the first time since they started (the phone, and travel from the detox center being isolated since day 1.)

Morgan's character is well trained in reading people's faces in terms of whether they are being totally honest and upfront about how clean they are and to what degree they've adhered to the program thus far, and actually kicks out several people for not sticking with it,
or lying about deviation from the process. Eventually, a graduation is held, that is appropriately celebrated with music and dance.

The film shows that the completion of the detox, is not a destination, or an end in itself, but a fresh starting point, or motivator to being sorting out the anarchy, or disorder that is present in each of the participant's personal and professional lives. For some, as with MK's character, this is easier said than done, as was the case with cleaning his own addiction, as he's admittedly become dependent on a married woman for his own romantic
impulses, herself struggling with a husband with a substance problem and a shaky marriage.

The lesson to be drawn is difficult to discern. Are financially troubled people, with bruised ego's and low self-esteem from professional and / or personal success more susceptible and prone to substance abuse and alcoholism? Or does addiction occur more frequently among those suffering from OCS (obsessive compulsive disorder) for example, as MK's character seems to show ? Do the problems relate to a biological inability to happily grow older as the years pass? Kathy Baker's and MK seem to revert to a teenage romance with its corresponding joy despite their actual ages, with a nostalgic trip in time to the JFK years of 1962 hit songs.

At the end of the day, there is only so much that any given individual can expect, whether before or after the detox program, from friends, family, employer, which is that nobody wants to pull the weight of another person who refuses to do so.  Life isn't perfect, but one cannot give up on life under the excuse of those imperfections ( not being well connected,  others are allowed to get away with financial schemes, etc.)

A questionable decision, in the editing room, was exposing several times the behinds of several actors, messy arm pits, and long dialogs in the urinal while taking samples.

The most remarkable is the finding of a sponsor, during the detox program, who is the addict's  personal life-line to curing their problem, and clearing the way to a more probable successful outcome, by carrying out emotional discussions, flushing pills, hard liquor and substances down the toilet, etc.

Walk in his shoes as he tries to escape life's troubles by hiding out in rehab, which we see with celebs today is all too common, only for Keaton's character to find out that it may be just the place he needed to go, to really sort out who he is and how he got there. Morgan Freeman costars, not as God actually in this one, but as a fellow adict. Check it out. May not be the happiest of endings, the good guy doesn't always get the girl, beat the baddie, or leave the audience in stiches of laughter, but Keaton can do all those things too.

Michael Keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead-on, even when the film is occasionally hard-going at times. In fact, the whole cast is first-rate, the direction good, and the script unflinching and realistic.

993154,5,6305162026,"I gave a DVD called Drunks Three stars and it earned each of them.  I just finished watching Clean and Sober and I am giving it FIVE stars only because, I am unable to give it fifty.  Clean and Sober was everything DRUNKS was NOT!  Clean and sober had a nice tight script that made you follow really close to keep up.

Clean and sober taught me more than a few things about drunks and druggies.  The prices on Drunks and Clean and Sober should be switched. Drunks is no where near good as Clean and Sober yet Drunks cost's a bit more. I would have gladly forked over 3 times the $7 price for Clean and Sober compared to the $21.99 for Drunks that was not worth its prenium price.  Both are fine movies but Clean and Sober was just so much better.

Clean and Sober made me think.  Clean and Sober was an emotional roller coaster.  I started out hating the main character in the movie. He started out a mean self absorbed trite nasty worthless no-account of the first order.  As the DVD progressed to the middle point he was no better.  The supporting actors in the movie were awesome, lending a sense of beleivability to the movie I liked.  Everybody seemed to have mastered those seedy loathesome scamming natures druggies and drunks have when they are seconds away from hitting rock bottom.

Slowly almost impreceptablyI started liking the main character.  I started thinking awe sweet he is going to hook up with his nice lady friend and then her beast of a boyfriend returns.  Then she leaves her boyfriend's house supposedly to get a pack of smokes and I figured she was heading back to see the main character mushy ending lots of kissing and gurgling noises as the credits rolled.  I won't tell you what happened but I was wrong again big time.  The ending rather shocked me and by the time the credits rolled, I was almost holding back tears. Vile thing was by the time the movie ended I honestly liked the title character.

I have never been a dope addict or alcoholic but I learned something from both Drunks and Clean and Sober.  I learned you can't really help a dope addict because, the help they need comes from within themselves.  Once an alcohohic or druggie starts cleaning up their lives and picking up the peices.  I learned you can give people in recovery opportunities but only once they have shown the commitment needed to rebuild their lives.  The hardest thing in the world is to stand by and watch some one you love fall into drugs or booze knowing the only one who can pull them out of that early grave is themselves.  Thats why I buy movies, because I learn things better when I can see them play out in front of me.

This movie left me with a great Joy and sorrow but, the funniest thing is I only really remember the joy.  As Clean and Sober and drunks teach addicted people make their own choices and their ain't a damn thing all the love in the world can do about it.  This is one of my A List Movies.  One last funny thing I almost did not buy this movie.  I only ended up buying it because, I needed like 4 bucks to hit the $25 minimum required to get Free super saver shipping so I tossed it in.  After seeing it I can not imagine my huge DVD collection without Clean and Sober in it.

Clean and Sober I think is a must have DVD.",1150588800,10,3261,4.315789473684211

993158,5,6305162026,"This film is not an escapist film, a film to help you forget the daily trials of life.  This is not a film where everything turns out happy at the end, the good guys always win, or justice triumphs over evil.

This, instead, is a movie about real life.  It focuses on drug and alcohol recovery, and on Daryl Poynter's journey through recovery.  Initially, Daryl thinks that he can get out of his problems (including a dying lady in his bed, and a missing $52,000) by hiding in a drug rehab center.  They surprise him by taking him all the way through rehab - to the other side.

The story takes you through Daryl's struggles, and his denial until finally, he must admit that he is an addict.  The characters are complex, and cannot be pigeonholed into the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" - which makes the characters completely believable.  This also makes us feel for the characters much more - and affects us strongly when the ending comes.

One notable thing about this movie - it was Michael Keaton's first dramatic role - and what a role.  This should have been nominated for awards all over, but it did win a prestigous Film Critic's Award - but that award has the most pull at the ""art cinemas.""  The Oscar which this film deserved never materialized. How sad.

993159,1,6305162026,"As it seems I contradict most of the reviews so far. I read some of them before I bought this DVD and I was completely disappointed. I usually do like movies about everyday people with everyday problems who could be your neighbors. (Instead of the alien, murder and life-is-so-funny type of movies). The plus about the movie is that the actors are really great - that is true. But the plot is completly dumb if not obvios. Keatons character is supposed to be an addict who gets into a clinic more by accident then by purpose and then the miracle happens and he becomes clean and sober. This movie suffers from a severe absence of stoned people, drugs (except for cigarrets) and all the downs of  addicts.  The main character (sorry, forgot name) does not seem to have any liquor frieds, no dealer except for one Spencer who is never available and so he does rarely struggle to stay clean. Instead he starts a love affair (or at least tries to). This movie has excactly one message: you have to admit to yourself that you are an addict before anyone or anything can help you.  This DVD is probably useful as a present for an alcoholic whom you want to see that he can get out of this if only he would see he has a problem, but you don't dare talking to him because he might immediadly agree and give you all his liquor instead. Not that you would have a problem with that... would you?",1094083200,4,1384,4.377431906614786
993160,5,6305162026,"Its a shame that Warner Brothers dismissed this excellent film, probably the best they released in the '80's, with a shoddy transfer and no extras. The DVD menu does not even have a graphic from the film but instead their obnoxious WB gold logo. At least a trailer would be nice. I'm not asking for a 7 disc Criterion Collection edition with 40 hours of supplemental footage or anything. They did this with Driving Miss Daisy"" also. No widescreen either. Nonetheless, the DVD does exist. Hopefully, Warner will do a better job with After Hours when they get around to transfering that.",1009929600,8,585,4.745098039215686
993161,5,6305162026,"One of the toughest things about drug and alcohol addiction is owning up to the fact of that addiction; being able to say, ""I'm an addict.""  Because until that happens, the addiction will continue and the prospect of getting any help will lessen with each passing day.  And the important thing is getting that help before it's too late, regardless of how it comes about.  It's being able to recognize the opportunity and having the gumption to take advantage of it, which is what happens to a young man on the brink of disaster in ""Clean and Sober,"" directed by Glenn Gordon Caron.  Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a high power real estate broker with a couple of problems:  He's appropriated some $90,000 from an escrow account to play the stock market (which quickly took a nose-dive on him, leaving him about $52,000 short), but that's not even his biggest problem; his biggest problem is that he's a cocaine addict, as well as an alcoholic-- and he doesn't even know it.  All he knows is that his life is in turmoil and he can't fathom why.  And when a girl picks up at a mall ODs in his bed one morning, his life really begins to fall apart.  He needs some time to sort things out and he needs to get away-- to hide for awhile-- and he comes up with a brilliant idea; he'll hide out in a rehab center where they guarantee anonymity and confidentiality.
 He checks in, and it works.  Nobody knows where he is, and the rules of the house prevent him from having any contact with the outside world.  But Daryl-- a born hustler-- has hustled himself into a corner this time.  Because he can't stay in if he doesn't play the game, which precipitates taking a long, hard look at himself.  So for the first time in his life he gets caught up in his own scam; and it just may be his salvation.  But before he can come back, he's going to have to hit rock bottom first, which he does-- in a pivotal scene involving a phone call to his mother.  And it's only when he's faced with total collapse that he finally begins to look inward, and to take stock of how he measures up against the others he meets at the facility; when he starts to realize that he's not the only person on the planet.
 Working from a tightly written screenplay by Tod Carroll, director Caron delivers a hard-hitting film that takes an uncompromising look at the effects of addiction, without relying or dwelling upon the physical aspects of the problem to illustrate the depths of despair to which it can lead.  To be sure, Daryl looks strung out; but that aside, the story relentlessly chronicles how swiftly drugs and alcohol can wreck a life in all regards.  It's a powerful statement, unflinchingly delivered in a concise and straightforward manner.  Caron approaches the subject head-on, avoiding any melodramatics while keeping it grounded in reality, which enhances the impact of the drama as it plays out.  And it clearly demonstrates how far-reaching the problem is, in that it touches so many others-- friends and family-- any and all who come into contact with Daryl.  It gives a personal perspective on the issue that is even more pronounced, in fact, than that of Sandra Bullock's ""28 Days"" or the more recent ""Blow,"" and is more emotionally involving as well, on the level of Steven Soderbergh's affecting drama, ""Traffic.""  This is an Oscar-worthy film on any number of levels, but 1988 was the year of ""Rain Man,"" and the Academy was clearly looking in another direction, leaving this film without even a nomination.  And it's a shame.
 As Daryl, Michael Keaton gives a performance that had Oscar written all over it; that he failed to receive even a nomination for his work here is a travesty, as this is without question the best he's ever done and on a par with any of the best of that year, including Hoffman's Oscar-winner.  Whenever an actor can disappear within a character so completely-- as Keaton does here-- it speaks volumes about the performance and the believability of that character; and there's no sign of Keaton when Daryl is on screen.  Keaton has a very definitive persona, but as you watch Daryl, there's not so much as a fleeting glimpse of Billy Blaze in ""Night Shift,"" Carter Hayes in ""Pacific Heights,"" Jack in ""Mr. Mom,"" or even ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Batman.""  With Daryl, Keaton has created a unique character, so real and presented with such intensity, that even a passing thought that this is an actor playing a role is impossible.  And that's a performance that deserves much more than a passing nod of acknowledgement.
 Also turning in an extremely affecting performance is Kathy Baker, as Charlie Standers, a fellow addict Daryl meets in rehab.  Baker has an alluring quality that works perfectly for the blue-collar character of Charlie, whose vulnerability quickly gains the sympathy of the audience and helps to draw you into the story emotionally.  There's an obvious softness beneath Charlie's rough-hewn exterior that is becoming, a down-to-earth aspect of the character that Baker conveys quite nicely.  This is a very real person she puts up on the screen, and it's easy to believe that she operates a crane in a steel mill, because there's nothing in the way Charlie is presented that is false or pretentious.  It's a solid performance, and one of the strengths of the film.
 The supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, who gives an understated, impressive performance as Craig, Daryl's counselor; Claudia Christian (Iris); M. Emmet Walsh (Richard), Tate Donovan (Donald), Brian Benben (Martin) and Henry Judd Baker (Xavier).  A realistic examination of a problem that affects virtually everyone either directly or indirectly, ""Clean and Sober"" is a sobering film that, while at times is emotionally draining, is nevertheless a worthwhile and entirely satisfying experience.",1008288000,95,5802,4.791164658634538

993163,5,6305162026,"There is no other way to say it. The acting is perfect, with Michael Keaton giving us a performance that calling wonderful would be an understatement. He gives of radiance. He takes us deep into the world of a coke addict, showing us every level of a man trying to run from his personal demons only to discover he has nowhere to hide. The script is brilliant, leaving no stone unturned in the quest to conquer addiction. The characters are sharply defined and deep in inner turmoil, with their every nook and cranny of their monumental personal struggles brought out for all to see. The direction is swift and sure, and the tone is gritty and real without being oppressive. It's an utterly brilliant, deeply haunting, character driven, emotional roller caoster ride that makes you weep for these poor souls from beginning to end. It's perfect. It deserved every oscar in existance (it received none, which serves as further proof that awards shows are a joke). Forget ""Traffic"". Ignore ""Less than Zero"".
