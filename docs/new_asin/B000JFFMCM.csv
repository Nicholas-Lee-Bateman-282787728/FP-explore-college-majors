8150160,5,B000JFFMCM,"THE HITCHHIKER was a mystery anthology series that aired from 1983-1987 on HBO and first choice in Canada, but then the series later moved to the USA Network from 1989-1991.

Each episode is introduced and concluded by a mysterious wanderer known as ""The Hitchhiker"" and explores the foibles of humanity & its dark spirit.  The title character was played by Nick Campbell from 1983-84 in only 3 episodes and then by Page Fletcher from 1984-91 in 82 episodes.

This series had a total of 85 episodes over 6 Seasons with 39 first runs on HBO and 46 first runs on USA and the series was filmed in Vancouver & Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and France.",1255996800,,643,4.62280701754386
8150161,4,B000JFFMCM,"This complete first season set was only issued in Canada, and as of this writing (9/09), is not currently in print. I wad fortunate enough to find an Amazon marketplace dealer who had a well-kept used copy, and it was a treat seeing the original episodes complete and uncut as they appeared 25 years ago on HBO.

The premise is generally this: the lead in the story set the tone for the events to follow, usually either picking up or driving by a lone hitchhiker (played by Page Fletcher) who encapsultes the lead character and what consequences will follow if that person commits some sort of wrong doing. After all is said and done, he then relates the ""moral"" of the story.

Guest stars in the first season include Robert Vaughn, Harry Hamlin, Margot Kidder, Shannon Tweed, Kirstie Alley, Gary Busey, Darren McGavin and many more...

Slighly macabre tales with lots of bare flesh and a twist at every ending.

This was the best year of the series by far, and if you are either an old fan of the series, or want to try something a bit different, if a chance to grab this first season set comes along, take it.",1254182400,,1111,4.485148514851486

--------------------------------------------------

I have a lot to tell you in this review. Let's start briefly with why I bought this set, which was only released in Canada. I own one of the Hitchhiker VHS tapes, but two of the three episodes are missing the beginning credits. I wanted the complete episodes, especially on DVD. I live in the United States, but the DVD released here (titled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitchhiker-Vol-1/dp/B00013D54Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitchhiker Vol. 1</a>"") only contains 10 episodes, only one of which was on the videotape. This Canada-only ""Season 1"" set contains the first 26 episodes of the series, although in a different order from how they were released in the United States (it's the first three seasons here).

I have no problem with the episodes being in a different order, what I *DO* have a problem with is the ungodly amount of compression artifacts found in the set. Practically EVERY episode has at least one noticable artifact (though admittedly a few of these you'd have to have an ""eye"" for in order to see them).

Here is a list of the episodes in this set, in the order presented on the DVDs, with the time markings of the compression artifacts listed in brackets after the episode title.

DISC 1
01. When Morning Comes [5:24/8:11/11:26/12:08]
02. Shattered Vows [18:39/19:09]
03. Split Decision [21:58]
04. Remembering Melody [NONE]
05. Face To Face [NONE]
06. And If We Dream [26:26(slight)/26:28(slight)/29:30(slight)]
07. Petty Thieves [NONE]
08. Hired Help [1:09(slight)/21:05(slight)]
09. Man At The Window [NONE]

DISC 2
10. Murderous Feelings [NONE]
11. Videodate [27:42(slight)]
12. A Time For Rifles [NONE]
13. Lovesounds [11:10]
14. Last Scene [16:35]
15. One Last Prayer [1:14(slight)/1:17(slight)/8:45]

26. Out Of The Night [1:51/2:05-2:08/5:28/20:33]

Now I'll list everything else that's wrong with this set.

* It comes in a cheap top/bottom load slipsleeve (the cases easily fall out when you take it off the shelf). I wish it was a side loader like mosts dvd-set sleeves.

* The seems like the version of ""Split Decision"" included is from an edited syndicated print as there are fade ins and fade outs (for commercial placement) that aren't seen in any other episodes. It's also clearly edited at 18:52 and at 18:54 - if you frame advance during the fade out you can briefly see another shot.

* In ""Last Scene"" there's an original tape defect at 28:35.

* In ""True Believer"" the picture jumps very slightly from 3:03 to 3:34.

* In ""Man's Best Friend"" there is no audio from 12:42-12:46. The original Lorimar video I have has the audio. The DVD cuts out music and the dog panting and the first part of Michael O'Keefe's dialogue (""I mean..."").

* There are several errors on the packaging text:

-- Most of the episode descriptions on the back of the cases give away the surprise endings.

-- The back of the sleeve mentions the following actors who are not in any of the episodes on the discs: Robbie Benson (was in ""Tourist Trap"" 1990), Louise Fletcher (was in ""Offspring"" 1991), Elliott Gould (was in ""A Whole New You"" 1991), Lisa Hartman (was in ""Her Finest Hour"" 1989), C. Thomas Howell (was in ""White Slaves"" 1990), Lauren Hutton (was in ""Riding The Nightmare"" 1990), Nick Mancuso (was in ""Fading Away"" 1990), Michael Ontkean (was in ""Square Deal"" 1989), and Alan Thicke (was in ""Tough Guys Don't Whine"" 1990).

-- The back of the sleeve mentions director Gerard Ciccoritti (aka Jerry Ciccoritti), but he did not direct any of the episodes on the discs (he directed ""Power Play"" 1989).

-- For episode 3 (Split Decision) it says ""retail"" when it should be ""real.""

-- For episode 9 (Man At The Window) it says the female lover's name is Catherine when it's really Carla (as listed in the end credits of the episode itself).

-- For episode 11 (Videodate) in the first sentence is says Gregg Henry's character is named Jack Rhodes, but in the last sentence it says his name is Jeff.

Now let me list the neutral and good points of this set.

* This DVD set includes the original Nicholas Campbell (as The Hitchhiker) version of ""Split Decision"" (ep 3), but the Page Fletcher versions of ""When Morning Comes"" (ep 1) and ""Shattered Vows"" (ep 2).

* For those purists in the USA, I should let you know that the Alliance Atlantis logo was tacked on to the end of all episodes. However, it appears AFTER the ""Markowitz/Chesler Producing"" logo and ""This Has Been An HBO Presentation"" screens, so all of the original content is present.

* Each episode has a 2.0 (stereo) and 5.1 audio track. I really see no need for the 5.1 track and would have preferred that they left it off (maybe there wouldn't be so many damn compression artifacts if they had that extra space on the discs to work with).

* There are no bonus features like in the U.S. ""Volume 1"" release (audio commentaries on selected eps).

* This set gives you more episodes for less money than the U.S. ""Volume 1"" set. For the record, there are only five episodes (from Seasons 4 & 5) on the U.S. set that aren't on here: Why Are You Here?, Homebodies, The Legendary Billy B., In the Name of Love, and The Miracle of Alice Ames.",1179187200,18,6140,5.052475247524752
